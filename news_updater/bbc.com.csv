bbc.com,,Sex Drive USA: On the road to sexual discovery with Stephanie Theobald,[],"More than 40 years ago, Fear of Flying, Erica Jongs now-legendary novel about female sexual exploration, was published. Hilarious and exhilaratingly frank, Jongs book focused on one womans search for erotic, personal and political happiness. It seems that women are still on that search. Even actor Emma Watson has just namechecked a site called OMGYes, which features educational clips and articles on sex, sexuality and desire.

Forty years later, the natural successor to Fear of Flying is in the making: its Sex Drive, by British journalist, editor and novelist Stephanie Theobald. Theobald has undertaken a road trip across America on a hunt for greater sexual self-knowledge and an insight into the weird, counter-cultural heart of the United States.

Life is full of sex, life is full of conflict Erica Jong

Part Jack Kerouac, part Joan Didion, Theobald brings a Londoners wit to what could have been a self-absorbed quest for personal pleasure and turns it into a travelogue that evokes Cheryl Strayeds Wild.

Theobald has been releasing extracts of her adventures on her site, in tantalising bites. While theres plenty of not-suitable-for-work shenanigans, Sex Drive is also an insight into a rarely seen aspect of America, one where eccentricity and originality can be found in the unlikeliest places.

Theobald spends time with women like Jocelyn Elders, whos now in her eighties and more fired up than ever. As Theobald tells me, Elders grew up picking cotton in Arkansas before rising to become Bill Clintons Surgeon General. She was fired by Bill Clinton at the height of the Aids crisis in 1994 for suggesting that masturbation should be talked about in schools.

""Shes 84 now and shes on the board of Trojan, the massive American condom company. Shes unstoppable. When I asked her where she got her rebel soul from, she used the word enslavement, she thought women and girls should have sexual knowledge and be able to take control of their lives.",[]

The republicans who control the US Congress have come out strongly against President Obamas latest plan to close down the Guantanamo Bay detention centre in Cuba. The latest proposal would transfer some detainees overseas, others to prisons in the United States. The president has described keeping Guantanamo open as contrary to American values.

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,Tim Vickery: Quando as cancoes dos Stones pareciam mudar o mundo,"['Colunista Da Bbc Brasil', 'Tim Vickery']","Image copyright Eduardo Martino

Perdi a turne dos Rolling Stones por estas aguas. Uma pena, mas tranquilo  fico feliz com as minhas lembrancas. Estive presente nas areias de Copacabana naquele show de dez anos atras e, com mais impacto ainda - porque se tratou da primeira vez -, tambem estive no Maracana em 1995.

E, vamos ser sinceros: desde entao (na verdade desde bem antes), pouca coisa mudou. E o mesmo repertorio, o mesmo ambiente. A carreira dos Stones pode servir como um exemplo da relatividade das coisas. Ha decadas a banda parece estar parada no tempo, fazendo o mesmo, e otimo, show.

Mas nada faz sentido sem referencia aos primeiros anos dos Stones, quando a velocidade das mudancas foi outra  tao rapida que era capaz de deixar qualquer um tonto.

Que capricho do destino e da historia  de colocar um grupo de jovens londrinos no olho de furacao, quando o seu proposito inicial nada mais era do que tocar blues em homenagem aos grandes negros americanos.

Mas, como sempre, os tempos fazem o homem. O mero desejo de tocar o blues ja era um sinal das mudancas, a busca por uma identidade nova. Uma Inglaterra saindo da Segunda Guerra Mundial, deixando de ser imperio e investindo no social. O nascimento de novas possibilidades e perguntas, como a grande duvida existencialista: como ser?

O inicio do boom da musica inglesa dos anos 60 reflete duas coisas  um amor pela musica negra americana e uma comemoracao da nova prosperidade.

Ate hoje os musicos ingleses da epoca nao param de prestar homenagem aos seus herois do outro lado do Atlantico. Mas junto com essa humildade logo veio uma arrogancia  tipo, ""a gente nao precisa se limitar a copia-los, podemos usar a musica deles como base para expressar a nossa realidade"". Ai, a coisa ficou interessante.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Apresentacao dos Rolling Stones em SP, em 27 de fevereiro; para Vickery, banda parece 'parada no tempo, fazendo o mesmo otimo show'

O grande triunfo no inicio da carreira dos Stones foi Satisfaction, em maio de 1965. A simplicidade aparente da cancao esconde uma sabedoria extraordinaria. Aborda as limitacoes da cultura do consumo, a sua incapacidade de cumprir a suas promessas, a sua necessidade de gerar insatisfacao constante para ficar crescendo.

E a cancao que abre alas para a segunda metade dos anos 60, quando, em vez de comemorar-se a prosperidade, houve uma cultura de jovens aberta, contestadora e inquieta. A musica estava na vanguarda e, durante alguns anos turbulentos, os Stones funcionaram como uma voz dessa geracao.

Com a pilula anticoncepcional agora disponivel, abrindo novas possibilidades sexuais, a banda lancou no inicio de 1967 Lets Spend the Night Together, uma celebracao do amor livre. Poucos meses depois veio We Love You, uma ultra-hippie resposta as autoridades que viviam tentando prender a banda por usar drogas. Um ano depois, chegou uma mensagem mais agressiva para o poder, Street Fighting Man, refletindo o ambiente quase revolucionario de 1968.

Em dezembro do ano seguinte veio mais uma obra-prima, Gimme Shelter, um hino inquietante e apocaliptico. Com sensibilidade, a banda sentiu o perigo do momento.

Image caption A banda em foto dos anos 1960, epoca em que ela produziu algumas de suas obras-primas

Poucos dias depois do lancamento de Gimme Shelter, houve o show gratis em Altamont, California. Marcou o fim do sonho hippie, da ideia de uma cultura de massa jovem capaz de se autorregular. Foi uma noite de caos e loucura, com a seguranca feita pelos Hells Angels, que espancaram ate a morte um jovem negro na plateia.

Altamont e um marco importante na carreira dos Stones. E o momento de ruptura entra a banda e o publico. Nunca mais o grupo seria a voz instintiva de parte de uma geracao. A banda fechou-se em si propria, uma situacao amplificada pelo deslocamento ao sul da Franca para fugir dos impostos ingleses.

Ainda produziu grandes musicas  houve experiencias interessantes com reggae, e uma ultima obra-prima em 1978, Miss You, uma otima interpretacao da era disco. Mas ja nao teve o mesmo peso cultural. Como a banda declarara em 1974, Its Only Rock 'n Roll.

Mas durante anos na decada anterior, nao tinha nada de ""somente"". Os Stones brincavam com fogo, lancando albuns que refletiram e influenciaram um tempo de turbulencia.

E isso ajuda a manter a banda viva ate hoje. As multidoes que vao assisti-los nao estao somente curtindo um show maravilhoso de rock. Estao tambem fazendo um tipo de comunhao  com uma epoca em que era possivel pensar que as cancoes da banda realmente tinham o poder de mudar o mundo.

bbc.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,The ultimate symbol of French cool,['Katya Foreman'],"When it comes to design icons of the civilian wardrobe, one of fashions small marvels has to be the tricot raye, or striped sailor jersey, a jaunty, utilitarian-cool classic that has hugged the forms of generations of tastemakers from Pablo Picasso to Kate Moss. In terms of Frenchness, the iconic garment can hold its own with the beret, imbued with its own seaside scent stretching from the Riviera to the Brittany coast.

Recorded by decree in March 1858 as the official undergarment of the French Navy, the original wool-knit naval jersey ended at the thigh with a snug, seamless, tube-like construction and slightly indented round neckline. Its signature feature was a block pattern of 21 white stripes and 2021 blue stripes with 15 white stripes and 1415 blue stripes on the sleeves.

An old tale from Brittany attributes each of the 21 stripes to the naval victories of Napoleons fleet against the British, according to Saint-James, which has been producing fishermens sweaters and Breton shirts since the mid-19th Century. Other reports suggest the stripes were conceived to stand out against the waves should the wearer go overboard.

Some reports suggest the stripes were conceived to stand out against the waves should the wearer go overboard

Experts trace the origins of the striped sailor jersey to the late 18th Century; early versions of the garment featured engravings from the Brittany and Normandy regions depicting fishermen. The first written trace dates back to 1855, in the form of a bulletin listing the contents of a sailors bag.

We dont know the real story behind the stripes, thats why there are so many myths surrounding it, says Delphine Allannic-Costa, co-curator of the 2009 exhibition Les marins font la mode (Sailors Make Fashion), held at the Musee national de la Marine in Paris, which juxtaposed sailors uniforms with fashion creations by the likes of Jean Paul Gaultier. (The couturier adopted the striped sailor jersey as his personal uniform, going on to make it a house signature down to the bottle of his iconic scent, Le Male, which evokes a sailors torso clad in the iconic garment.)

The striped sailor jersey has also attracted various unofficial monikers over the years, including mariniere (French for marine) and the Breton shirt, with the latter possibly inspired by garlic merchants and Onion Johnnies, the nickname given to travelling onion sellers from the town of Roscoff in Brittany, whose uniform of striped fishermans sweater and beret cemented the stereotypical image of the Frenchman.

Nautical but nice

National pride stirred Europes earliest naval-inspired trends, such as the sailor look embraced by the children of well-to-do Victorian families after Queen Victoria in 1846 had a miniature sailor suit made for her four-year-old son, Albert Edward, to wear aboard the Royal Yacht. But the rise of the striped sailor jersey was one of the first examples of workwear filtering into fashion, also serving as a symbol of emancipation for women.

Among the earliest adopters was the French writer Colette  who had a penchant for drag. In the late 19th Century she would attend masked balls in Paris dressed in sailor-striped jerseys, and later on the Paris Interlope cabarets of the Belle Epoque, according to Allannic-Costa.

Gabrielle Chanel, a lover of comfort dressing who pioneered bringing menswear inspirations into the womans wardrobe, is credited with propelling the striped sailor jersey into the fashion sphere. She was her own best advert, adopting a striped sailor top, straw hat and loose trousers as her resort-wear look. Her first sailor-inspired piece was a smock with a sailor collar made from jersey  a material hitherto reserved for mens underwear and sailor shirts  that she introduced in her boutique in the upscale northern seaside resort of Deauville in the early 1900s.

But for British fashion historian Amber Butchart, author of Nautical Chic, key influencers of the trend included wealthy US expatriates Gerald and Sara Murphy, whose Riviera home, Villa America, was a playground for the Jazz Age social set. (The golden couple inspired the characters Dick and Nicole Driver in F Scott Fitzgeralds novel Tender Is the Night.)

The striped sailor jersey was one of the first examples of workwear filtering into fashion, also serving as a symbol of emancipation for women

They set up this amazing home on the Riviera where all of the leading lights of the day would congregate and theres an account of Gerald Murphy going to Marseille to get supplies for his house and coming back with a load of these striped tops, basically undershirts, that hed picked up in a boat supply shop and distributing them to his guests, says Butchart.

There are images of him in [a striped sailor top] on the Riviera in 1924/1925 and very soon after you see people like F Scott Fitzgerald wearing them  theres a fantastic image of him dressed in one at the beach with plus fours, she says of the authentic garment that became a staple of chic leisurewear associated with these slightly bohemian artistic circles. Its a look that has been adopted by artists ever since, including Jackson Pollock, adds Butchart. Throughout history there have been strong links between fishing communities and artists, with artists often moving to fishing towns to set up artist colonies.

Mode Riviera

Having bubbled up during the Belle Epoque, the striped sailor top really took off in the late 1940s, according to Allannic-Costa, with two directions at play simultaneously. In the jazz clubs of Pariss Saint-Germain-des-Pres district artists, writers and intellectuals like Boris Vian, Leonard Foujita and Jacques Prevert donned authentic striped sailor jerseys. The South of France, meanwhile, saw the emergence of the so-called mode Riviera for women with local It-girl Brigitte Bardot hitting one of the first editions of the Cannes Film Festival in a red version of the striped sailor jersey.

Stars of the silver screen also helped fuel the legacy of the iconic garment  think Marlon Brando in The Wild One (1953) and New Wave gamine Jean Seberg in Breathless (1960)  that was adopted by the Beatnik community in the 1960s. The catwalk soon caught on, with Yves Saint Laurent reinterpreting the mariniere in his first collection (Spring/Summer 1962). The garment continues to serve as inspirational fodder for fashion designers today from Comme des Garcons to Hedi Slimane  now at the creative helm of Saint Laurent  inevitably filtering down to the fast fashion behemoths.

With subliminal seafaring messages woven into its very fabric, Allannic-Costa believes the call of the timeless striped sailor top remains as strong as ever. She recalls the impact of coming across a self-portrait of Robert Mapplethorpe in a mariniere following her Paris exhibition.

I was so blown away to see him wearing one, as part of this poet movement in New York in the 1970s, with Patti Smith, she says. Theres this image of the sailor as a free, independent man, an adventurer, whether its true or not, and that mixed with these bohemian artist associations is really powerful, she continues. And even today, when you wear a striped sailor jersey in the street, thats the message it gives off.

Dengan sungai es yang biru, salju, dan pemandangan yang merentang di cakrawala, Greenland adalah satu dari beberapa tempat di bumi yang membuat aplikasi Instagram menjadi amat mubazir.

Amat indah namun juga memiliki iklim paling keras yang tidak terbayangkan sehingga warga Greenland perlu beradaptasi untuk bekerja dan bertahan hidup.

Merupakan pulau terbesar di dunia (selain Benua Australia) dan negara ke-12 terbesar dunia, populasinya hanya 56.000 jiwa, seukuran satu kota kecil.

Sebagian besar wilayahnya berada di bagian bawah Kutub Utara, dengan matahari yang tidak terbit pada musim dingin namun bersinar sepanjang hari dan sepanjang malam saat musim panas.

Tetangga terdekatnya adalah Kanada namun menjalin hubungan politik dan ekonomi dengan Denmark, yang jaraknya lima jam penerbangan.

Greenland adalah tempat yang unik, penuh dengan paradoks dan keanehan, khususnya dalam upaya penduduknya untuk mengikuti perubahan iklim, budaya, dan ekonomi.

Maik, pengusaha es krim

Perekonomian Greenland umumnya menyangkut perburuan dan perikanan yang sekaligus menjadi bagian tak terpisahkan dari kehidupan, namun dunia usaha juga berkembang.

Contohnya, Maik Carretero yang tinggal di ibukota Nuuk, tempat dia mengelola bisnis es krimnya, Es Greenland. Ini jelas hal yang ganjil. Menjual es krim di tempat yang paling dingin di dunia jelas akan gagal. Namun kenyataannya bertolak belakang.

Image caption Maik Carretero mengatakan Es Greenland menggunakan es dari gua-gua di Greenland.

""Warga Greenland suka es krim. Maksud saya, benar-benar suka, kata Carretero. Jika di luar dingin dan Anda makan sesuatu yang dingin, maka badan Anda akan mengatakan oohhhh itu dingin, mari saya hangatkan tubuh.

Mungkin ada dasar ilmu pengetahuan untuk teori Carrtero itu, mungkin juga tidak. Tapi teori itu berguna untuknya.

Saya mulai tahun 2008 di sebuah ruangan kecil namun berkembang pesat dan saya pindah tahun lalu, katanya.

Di sebuah unit industri di pinggir kota, Carretero dan timnya membuat dan menjual produknya dengan menggunakan sumber daya setempat. Kami menggunakan es dari gua-gua, yang memiliki rasa yang amat asli. Semua orang bisa memakannya karena tidak mengandung susu atau krim.

Idenya berasal dari hal sederhana. Saya ingin istri saya menikmatinya dan dia tidak toleran atas laktose.

Carretero menjual produknya di 50 tempat di seluruh Greenland. Dia juga mengembangkan ekspor ke Denmark dengan kontrak memasok beberapa jaringan besar, seperti untuk pusat perbelanjaan kelas atas, Magasin du Nord.

Kami ingin mengembangkan Islandia dan siapa tahu? katanya.

Sara pengemudi kereta luncur yang ditarik anjing

Di Sisimiut, sekitar 64 km di sebelah selatan Kutub Utara, suhu lebih dingin dengan -15derajat Celsius dan saljunya juga lebih tebal. Pada Bulan Maret, masa yang paling banyak salju, rata-rata ketebalan salju di sini bisa mencapai 70 cm.

Image caption Sara Berthelsen sudah bekerja dengan anjing sejak berusia delapan tahun.

Diterpa angin dingin, mahasiswa kedokteran paruh waktu dan juga pengemudi kereta luncur paruh waktu, Sara Berthelsen berjuang mengatur 10 ekor anjing huskie besar dan 10 yang kecil. Dia berdiri di samping kereta peluncur kayu, siap untuk memulai perjalanan.

Ini sudah mendarah daging. Ayah selalu punya anjing dan saya sudah bekerja dengan mereka sejak berusia delapan tahun. Saya ikut dalam perjalanannya kalau pas bisa, jelas Berthelsen.

Di beberapa wilayah Greenland, khususnya di bagian utara, anjing dan kereta luncur digunakan sebagai alat transportasi dan untuk berburu.

Namun di Sisimiut, lebih banyak digunakan untuk sensasi ketegangan, baik bagi warga lokal maupun turis. Bekerja sama dengan Hotel Sisimiut, Berthelsen membawa para turis untuk melakukan perjalanan yang akan dikenang sepanjang hidup.

Berdiri di ujung belakang kereta luncur, yang melewati pemandangan indah pegunungan, Berthelsen bersiap-siap untuk mendaki perbukitan yang disebut Pemukul Punggung. Dan pendakian itu bukan satu-satunya bahaya yang mengancam.

Kekhawatiran terbesar saya adalah terlepas dari anjing penarik dan harus berjalan kaki sendirian ke rumah. Sekitar dua tiga jam untuk kembali dan Anda berjalan sendirian, katanya.

Bahaya lainnya perubahan cepat dari kondisi lingkungan.

Saya kira mengemudikan kereta luncur dengan anjing akan punah karena perubahan iklim. Kondisinya berubah, jelas Berthelsen.

Es sangat tidak bisa diduga, khususnya di bagian utara, sehingga membuatnya berbahaya. Es bisa tiba-tiba retak dan saya mendengar ada anjing huskie jatuh ke dalam lubang.

Edvard kapten kapal es

Pekerjaan lain yang berbahaya adalah membawa kapal ke dekat fjord atau lembah es Ilulissat, sekitar 350 km dari Kutub Utara. Di bawah kemudi Edvard Samuelsen, kapal sepanjang 10 meter dengan berat 18 ton menelusuri celah-celah gunung es yang tingginya bisa mencapai 30 meter di atas permukaan laut.

Image caption Edvard Samuelsen 'lebih suka' penumpangnya duduk santai dan menikmati pemandangan, bukan memotret.

Berlayar selalu menjadi mimpi saya. Saya masuk sekolah bahari pada usia 17 tahun dan bekerja di kapal sejak itu, kata Samuelsen.

Dia biasanya membawa 12 penumpang untuk menikmati salah satu pemandangan yang paling menakjubkan di planet Bumi.

Gunung es tampak besar dari sini, tuturnya sambil menelusuri monster gunung es. Namun Anda hanya melihat sebagian kecil di atas permukaan air. Ukuran yang sebenarnya bisa tujuh sampai delapan kali.

Gunung-gunung es itu tampak seperti gedung pencakar langit yang mengambang di air.

Image caption Kapal Edvard Samuelsen sepanjang 10 meter dengan berat 18 ton menelusuri celah-celah gunung es. Foto: Edvard Samuelsen.

Samuelsen naik ke buritan kapal dan mendorong salah satu kakinya ke blok air yang membeku untuk mengambil segumpal besar es.

Aku akan cairkan es ini dan meminumnya di rumah. Air terbaik di dunia. Ribuan tahun sejarah berada dalam satu gelas air, jelasnya.

Dari kapalnya sambil menghirup kopi hitam- Samuelsen menunjuk pada perbukitan es.

Anda kadang bisa melihat singa laut dan sesekali paus. Kadang, kalau para penumpang memotret dengan kameranya, aku pikir akan lebih indah bagi mereka untuk duduk santai dan menikmatinya.

Nivikka, Kepala Pusat Maritim Greenland

Sebagai satu pulau besar, ikan dan hewan laut menjadi salah satu sumber daya Greenland yang berlimpah. Industri perikanan amat penting bagi perekonomian nasional dan lapangan kerja yang terbesar, dengan sekitar satu dari 10 orang bekerja di industri ini.

Ikan halibut, cod, udang, dan kepiting yang paling banyak ditangkap namun karena air yang semakin menghangat, ikan mackerel dan tuna juga bisa ditangkap di sebelah selatan Greenland, sebagai akibat dari perubahan iklim.

Image caption Nivikka Brandt pernah menjadi kapten kapal sebelum pindah bekerja di darat.

Namun perikanan bukan hanya tentang tangkapan yang besar.

Nivikka Brandt adalah Kepala Pusat Maritin Greenland di Nuuk, yang mengajarkan orang untuk mendapat keterampilan bekerja di laut. Kursusnya, dengan masa belajar yang berbeda-beda, mendidik sekitar 25 hingga 40 orang setiap semester.

Brandt mengatakan sebagai bagian dari industri global, kualifikasi amat diperlukan jika seseorang ingin mengembangkan kariernya di laut.

Para murid belajar semuanya, mulai dari membuat jala sampai navigasi dan menangani penumpang gelap maupun belajar bahasa Inggris, tutur Brandt. Kami memiliki ruang radio untuk berhubungan dengan kapal yang sedang berlayar di laut sana dan juga simulator kapal.

bbc.com,2015-04-08 00:00:00,Bhutans dark secret to happiness,['Eric Weiner'],"On a visit to Thimphu, the capital of Bhutan, I found myself sitting across from a man named Karma Ura, spilling my guts. Maybe it was the fact that he was named Karma, or the thin air, or the way travel melts my defences, but I decided to confess something very personal. Not that long before, seemingly out of the blue, I had experienced some disturbing symptoms: shortness of breath, dizziness, numbness in my hands and feet. At first, I feared I was having a heart attack, or going crazy. Maybe both. So I went to the doctor, who ran a series of tests and found...

Nothing, said Ura. Even before I could complete my sentence, he knew that my fears were unfounded. I was not dying, at least not as quickly as I feared. I was having a panic attack.

What I wanted to know was: why now  my life was going uncharacteristically well  and what could I do about it?

You need to think about death for five minutes every day, Ura replied. It will cure you.

How? I said, dumbfounded.

It is this thing, this fear of death, this fear of dying before we have accomplished what we want or seen our children grow. This is what is troubling you.

But why would I want to think about something so depressing?

Rich people in the West, they have not touched dead bodies, fresh wounds, rotten things. This is a problem. This is the human condition. We have to be ready for the moment we cease to exist.

Places, like people, have a way of surprising us, provided we are open to the possibility of surprise and not weighed down with preconceived notions. The Himalayan kingdom is best known for its innovative policy of Gross National Happiness; its a land where contentment supposedly reigns and sorrow is denied entry. Bhutan is indeed a special place (and Ura, director of the Centre for Bhutan Studies, a special person) but that specialness is more nuanced and, frankly, less sunny than the dreamy Shangri-La image we project onto it.

Actually, by suggesting I think about death once a day, Ura was going easy on me. In Bhutanese culture, one is expected to think about death five times a day. That would be remarkable for any nation, but especially for one so closely equated with happiness as Bhutan. Is this secretly a land of darkness and despair?

Not necessarily. Some recent research suggests that, by thinking about death so often, the Bhutanese may be on to something. In a 2007 study, University of Kentucky psychologists Nathan DeWall and Roy Baumesiter divided several dozen students into two groups. One group was told to think about a painful visit to the dentist while the other group was instructed to contemplate their own death. Both groups were then asked to complete stem words, such as jo_. The second group  the one that had been thinking about death  was far more likely to construct positive words, such as joy. This led the researchers to conclude that death is a psychologically threatening fact, but when people contemplate it, apparently the automatic system begins to search for happy thoughts.

None of this, Im sure, would surprise Ura, or any other Bhutanese. They know that death is a part of life, whether we like it or not, and ignoring this essential truth comes with a heavy psychological cost.

Linda Leaming, author of the wonderful book A Field Guide to Happiness: What I Learned in Bhutan About Living, Loving and Waking Up  knows this too.I realised thinking about death doesnt depress me. It makes me seize the moment and see things I might not ordinarily see, she wrote. My best advice: go there. Think the unthinkable, the thing that scares you to think about several times a day.

Unlike many of us in the West, the Bhutanese dont sequester death. Death  and images of death  are everywhere, especially in Buddhist iconography where youll find colourful, gruesome illustrations. No one, not even children, is sheltered from these images, or from ritual dances re-enacting death.

Ritual provides a container for grief, and in Bhutan that container is large and communal. After someone dies, theres a 49-day mourning period that involves elaborate, carefully orchestrated rituals. It is better than any antidepressant, Tshewang Dendup, a Bhutanese actor, told me. The Bhutanese might appear detached during this time. They are not. They are grieving through ritual.

Why such a different attitude toward death? One reason the Bhutanese think about death so often is that it is all around them. For a small nation, it offers many ways to die. You can meet your demise on the winding, treacherous roads. You can be mauled by a bear; eat poisonous mushrooms; or die of exposure.

Another explanation is the countrys deeply felt Buddhist beliefs, especially that of reincarnation. If you know youll get another shot at life, youre less likely to fear the end of this particular one. As Buddhists say, you shouldnt fear dying any more than you fear discarding old clothes.

Which isnt to say, of course, that the Bhutanese dont experience fear, or sadness. Of course they do. But, as Leaming told me, they dont flee from these emotions. We in the West want to fix it if were sad, she said. We fear sadness. Its something to get over, medicate. In Bhutan theres an acceptance. Its a part of life.

Uras lesson, meanwhile, stuck with me. I make it a point to think about death once a day. Unless I find myself especially stressed, or engulfed in an unexplained funk. Then I think about it twice a day.

bbc.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,Is this Chinas best city for expats?,['Denise Hruby'],"Initially, Shanghai sounded less than appealing to American Andrea Duty. When her husband Chris told her that his company had offered him a position in the city, she didnt even want to discuss it.

My first reaction was: absolutely not

My first reaction was: absolutely not, Duty recalled several months later, munching on imported Spanish cheese in a Tapas bar in the heart of Shanghai.

Two months after their move, the couple is in love with Shanghai, and, like many foreigners, they can reel off an almost endless list of reasons for it.

Shanghai is the largest and most cosmopolitan city in China, and its glamour has long been a draw for foreigners from all over the world. For more than 150 years, people from overseas have found a home away from home here. Then and now, its opportunity that drives them to settle here.

But Chinas recent economic woes have meant fewer expats are establishing themselves in the country. Reports indicate the number of foreigners in the city was around 255,000 around a year ago, a drop of 2% versus 2014.

Economic growth slipped to just under 7% last year, the stock market has been volatile and rich Chinese are seeking ways to get their money out of the country. In recent years some foreign companies have become more pessimistic about their operations in China, and started to replace foreigners in top positions with foreign-educated Chinese. In 2014, twice as many expats moved out of the China than into it, a study by UniGroup Relocation found.

Although everyone is waiting for the economic bubble to burst, Chinas financial capital is still a very attractive option for workers looking for an exciting overseas assignment. Foreigners still see Shanghai as a chance to either further their career in ways they couldnt at home, or to make money quickly. For many, its both.

Making money

Expats here have an interesting opportunity because its still such a boomtown, and many are moving in, said Duty, an American chef who is working on a cookbook on French regional pastries.

I do find it more financially comfortable than living in London or in New York

Most expats dont find life in Shanghai all that expensive  perhaps because expat incomes are high. In China, foreigners make an average of about $158,000 a year, compared to a global average of just over $104,000, HSBCs 2015 Expat Explorer survey found.

Many professionals work in management positions, and are paid premiums to make the big leap here, despite relatively greater cultural hurdles and worsening air pollution. Some are even offered a pollution hazard pay.

Over the past few years, air pollution levels have worsened in Shanghai. On some days, the air is deemed very unhealthy but it hardly ever reaches the hazardous levels Beijing residents are struggling with.

But the glitz and the many comforts of living in Shanghai have their price, a recent survey by corporate consultants ECA International found. In terms of cost of living, Shanghai has surpassed other Asian metropolises and takes the top rank as the continents most expensive city for expats.

The survey only compared consumer goods and services, and did not consider housing or income, but other studies, too, show that the city of more than 24 million can be one of the worlds most expensive.

Life in Shanghai can be very affordable

But other than paying for pricey home comforts such as dairy products or fresh produce, life in Shanghai can be very affordable, at least compared to Hong Kong. Lunch in Western restaurants is typically less than $10, an amount that would also get you a taxi across the city. If you get on the extensive and modern subway system, youll hardly ever pay more than $1.

For us, our cost of eating went down, the cost of groceries, the cost of transportation... I do find it more financially comfortable than living in London or in New York, Duty said.

Not only is their disposable income higher than when they lived in the West, but, barring air pollution, their way of life has improved.

The Dutys now pay similar monthly rent as they did in London, but their apartment is much more spacious, spreading over two floors with a furnished living room and kitchen.

There are pitfalls for house hunters, as many agents are unreliable and some listings are fake

Finding a home was quick and easy for the Dutys, but there are pitfalls for house hunters, as many agents are unreliable and some listings are fake. Real estate agents usually come referred by co-workers or friends who have already lived in Shanghai.

Where to settle

Its a great place for foreigners, said Carlby Xie, China research director for real estate firm Colliers International.

Overall, the vibe is cosmopolitan and modern, and the general attitude toward foreigners is friendly.

Housing, however, is the biggest concern for foreigners, and rents vary widely depending on location. Generally, Colliers found that rents cost about $29 a square metre, but expats often pay much more because to them, location matters, Xie said.

Long-term expats complain that expenses have skyrocketed in just a few years. The days are long past when a modern, centrally located, one-bedroom apartment would cost no more than 3,000 yuan (about US$450 per month). Prices have more than doubled, depending on the area.

The former French Concession in downtown Shanghai is one of the most popular locations, featuring fancy mansions with gables, spires and steeples. A small studio here will cost $1,200 per month or more. For young foreigners with little work experience, that can be as much as two-thirds of their salary, said Xie.



Bring the kids

From the French Concession, a couple of subway stops under the Huangpu River will take you to Puxi, where ritzy skyscrapers butt up against each other. Its where families often live in serviced apartments close to international private schools.

Schools are plentiful but expensive. Tuition for a child starts around $1,500 per month, depending on age and school, and a serviced apartment with enough room for a small family starts around $3,500 a month.

It doesnt matter if they are Germans, Brits, Australians or Singaporeans, they come to Shanghai to make money

Most of that isnt paid by expats directly, though.

If you came with a company and you work at an executive level, you are entitled to a package and they pay for your housing and so on, so you can save a lot, Xie said.

And even if they didn't, tuition and cost of rent wont break the bank. At least a quarter of expatriates in China make more than $300,000 a year, the highest proportion in any country HSBC surveyed.

It doesnt matter if they are Germans, Brits, Australians or Singaporeans, they come to Shanghai to make money. Some of them stay for two to five years, depending on their adaptability, and when they have saved enough money, they return back home and invest in real estate.

Jobs and regulations

Managers, bankers, engineers, IT professionals, architects, designers and other highly skilled and experienced foreigners will always find well-paid jobs in Shanghai.

Marketing, sales, events, PR and branding are sectors with jobs where less experience is required. Searches on LinkedIn and expat websites with job and apartment listings like SmartShanghai will get you results for those positions where headhunters aren't involved. Preference will be given to those who speak basic Mandarin, and putting an effort into studying it will pay off not just when it comes to job hunts. The Shanghainese are incredibly helpful  and often impressed  if foreigners speak the littlest bit of Chinese.

If you do plan to move to Shanghai and have found a job here, dont start packing right away. The visa process can be quite gruelling, although companies handle everything. To get a Z visa, which allows you to properly work for a company in Shanghai, you need several documents and certificates, from birth certificate to a health check including testing for sexually transmitted infections.

The application can take several months and regulations change frequently.

Living it up

Many expats in Shanghai ride an overly crowded subway to work, eat a bowl of dumpling soup from a hole-in-the wall spot for lunch and marvel over elderly men playing Chinese chess in parks.

But what also makes this city so popular for foreigners is that any comfort they know from home is just around the corner.

You also know that Starbucks and good Italian food is just around the corner. Its a really nice blend of East and West

You also know that Starbucks and good Italian food is just around the corner. Its a really nice blend of East and West, said Maura Cunningham, a Philadelphia native who lived in Shanghai for two years while working on her dissertation.

She spent half of her $2,000 a month on her apartment and tailored the rest of her budget to what she could afford. Even with a limited budget, Cunningham could use Shanghai as a base to explore other places in China and in Asia.

Using high-speed trains, it takes about five hours to get to Beijing, and one hour to get to other major cities in the Yangtze River Delta. Japan is an inexpensive two-hour flight away, and for around $300, the tropical islands of Southeast Asia invite for diving and cocktails on sandy beaches.

Cunningham may not have been able to invest in real estate when she moved back to the US, but her work in Shanghai and her language skills set her up for a job as a programme officer with the National Committee on US-China Relations.

Its the common factor for expats in Shanghai that they might move only to further their career and boost their incomes. But most find themselves really enjoying life here.

I was only there for two years, but I miss it. Its as much home as Philadelphia, Cunningham said.

bbc.com,,Climate deadline looms for African food crops,"['Mark Kinver', 'Bbc News', 'Environment Reporter']","Image copyright CIAT Image caption Beans are sensitive to night-time temperatures, making them particularly vulnerable to climatic changes

Researchers have produced a timescale of how projected climate change is set to alter the face of agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Climate change is widely projected to have a significant adverse impact on food security if no adaptation measures are taken, they explain.

In their study, the team provides timings of the ""transformations"" needed to help minimise these impacts.

The findings have been published in the journal Nature Climate Change.

Agricultural activities are considered to be one of the main drivers to reduce poverty and improve food security among the planet's undernourished population, which is estimated to be 800-850 million people.

Climate change is widely expected to have a destabilising effect on food production systems, the authors observe, and previous studies have concluded that adaptation ""will be required if food production is to be increased in both quantity and stability to meet food security needs during the 21st Century"".

Co-author Julian Ramirez-Villegas from the University of Leeds, UK, said the study carried out by the CGIAR research programme on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) set out to quantify for the first time when changes to food production were likely to happen.

""Rather than focusing on what we need to do by a certain time, we know that there is a range of options and then we put deadlines on these options,"" he told BBC News.

Image copyright CIAT Image caption Maize was one of three staple crops that researchers found to be vulnerable to future climate change

The team assessed when areas growing nine of Sub-Saharan Africa's staple crops - which account for half of the region's food production - would have to undergo ""transformational adaptation"", which refers to a fundamental shift in an area's food production system. For example, stop growing crops and switch to livestock farming instead.

Dr Ramirez-Villegas said the study found that six of the nine crops assessed were ""stable in respect to transformation and adaptation"".

""It does not mean there will not be impacts, for example the yields might decrease,"" he added.

""But there are three - beans, maize and bananas - that are more unstable and are therefore projected to have large amounts of area under transformational change.

""In the case of beans, in particular, we see about 60% of the area in need of transformation and adaption (under a high warming scenario - +3.0C/5.4F) because the climate shifts away from the conditions were you can actually grow the crop.""

'Climate-smart' crops

However, he added that it was not all bad news as technological advancements offered hope of increasing resilience to changes in the growing conditions.

One example was ""climate smart"" crop varieties. In 2015, researchers reported a breakthrough in the development of temperature-resilient beans that could help sustain a vital source of protein for millions of people around the globe.

""Also, in the longer term, where transformation is unavoidable, you can shift crops,"" Dr Ramirez-Villegas explained.

""Just because people are no longer able to grow one crop, it does not mean that people have no options. In most cases, we find that there are alternative crops that remain suitable for those places.""

He said the team found that there were only ""very specific pockets"" where farmers would have to shift away from the nine staple crops that were assessed in the study.

""In those cases, livestock might constitute an alternative livelihood option, or people might completely change their livelihood by migrating, for example, or by completely changing the land-use,"" he suggested.

In order to maximise the options available to farmers to cope with projected climatic changes, Dr Ramirez-Villegas said that there were two areas that needed addressing.

""We need to work on the barriers to the adoption of technologies, as we know that in Sub-Saharan Africa, adoption levels are sometimes low,"" he observed.

""What we also need to do is to put planned adaptation into national development plans.""

In a separate study, published in The Lancet, researched warned that climate change could be responsible for more than half-a-million deaths by the middle of the century.

The research was described as the strongest evidence yet that ""climate change could have damaging consequences for food production and health worldwide"".",[]

bbc.com,,The Prosecutors: Real Crime and Punishment,[],"Series about the Crown Prosecution Service. Prosecutors in the Complex Casework units of CPS Mersey-Cheshire and CPS South-East prepare for trials in two historic cases.

The Crown Prosecution Service is often under scrutiny for its decision-making. Now for the first time the CPS has allowed cameras in. Filmed over 18 months with prosecutors in Merseyside, Cheshire and the South East, including the director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, this groundbreaking series goes behind the scenes to reveal how our criminal justice system really works and what it takes to secure a conviction. Each episode focuses on a different part of the process, following prosecutions and those involved in the case from start to finish.

In the final episode, prosecutors in the Complex Casework units of CPS Mersey-Cheshire and CPS South-East are preparing for trials in separate historic cases.

In 1993, a few days after her 16th birthday, Claire Tiltman was murdered in an alleyway. Since Colin Ash-Smith admitted to other knife attacks in the same area, he has been the main suspect for the crime. In 1996 he was sentenced to life imprisonment for those offences. But without direct evidence, he was not charged with the murder of Claire Tiltman.

Claire's parents died before seeing her killer brought to justice and a group of her school friends took up the campaign to keep the case in the public eye. Now, using a change in the law which might allow the jury to know about Ash-Smith's other attacks and the similarities between them, prosecutor Nigel Pilkington is trying to build a circumstantial case against Colin Ash-Smith.

In Mersey-Cheshire, a non-recent sex abuse case is being prepared for trial. Keith Cavendish Coulson is facing 42 counts of indecent assault on boys in the 1970s and 80s. He says they're lying and that it never happened. The CPS's handling of non-recent sex abuse cases is often highly controversial and Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, is involved in overseeing the case.

Cases committed a long time ago are charged and sentenced according to the law at the time. As Cavendish Coulson's offences were in the 1970s and 80s, they can only charge him under the old law of 1956. Historic cases also present challenges, as the memories of witnesses might have faded and evidence might no longer be available. But moving testimony from Cavendish Coulson's accusers suggests they have far from forgotten these offences.",[]

Suriye'de savas bitmedi, husumetlerin son bulmasna yonelik cabalar catsmalara ksmen ara verilmesini saglad sadece.

Rusya'nn bombardman devam ediyor. ISID'e kars ABD onderligindeki hava saldrlar da suruyor.

Dunyann dikkati Suriye uzerinde yogunlasmsken Irak'ta da onemli gelismeler oluyor. Ayrca Libya'da da ISID'e kars saldrya baslamak icin hazrlklar yapldgna dair isaretler artyor.

ABD'deki baskanlk secimleri icin adaylarn belirlenmesi surecinde butun dram ve gerginlikler devam ederken Suriye, Irak ve Libya'da olup bitenler buyuk onem tasyor.

Buradaki olaylar Beyaz Saray'daki yeni baskan bekleyen dunyay bicimlendiriyor.

Irak'ta ISID'in elindeki Musul yeni buyuk odul olacak.

8 ila 12 Irak tugay saldrya hazrlanyor. Kimse bunun kolay ya da cabuk olmasn beklemiyor.

ABD Genelkurmay Baskan General Joseph Dunford birkac gun once ""Musul'a kars operasyonlar zaten baslad... Musul'u kusatyoruz"" demisti.

General, ISID'in denetimindeki Rakka ile Musul arasndaki onemli baglant yollarn kesmek amacyla hem Suriye'de hem de Irak'ta duzenlenen cesitli bolgesel saldrlara gonderme yapyordu.

Bunun onemli unsurlarndan biri ABD ve muttefikleri tarafndan yurutulen hava saldrlar. Ama son on gunde Suriyeli muhalif gucler, kuzey-dogudaki Saddadi'yi ele gecirdi. Amerikallar buray ""Egitim ve lojistik acsndan oldugu kadar petrol satslar acsndan da ISID icin onemli bir nokta"" olarak tanmlyor.

Irak gucleri Bagdat'n kuzeyindeki Samarra sehrinde ISID'e kars ayr bir operasyon baslatt.

Musul taarruzunda ABD'nin muhtemel yardmnn ne boyutta olacag tartslyor simdi.

Irak hukumeti bu konuda oldukca duyarl. ABD'nin resmi acklamalar da temkinli. Ama Washington'un onemli olcude caba gostermesi gerektigi ack.

Onerilerden biri, Amerikal askeri dansmanlarn eylem noktasna daha yakn olacak sekilde konuslandrlmas. Fakat hava gucunun yan sra ABD'nin en onemli rolu, Irak ordusunun hzl tempoda faal kalmas icin yeterli lojistik ve ikmale sahip olmasn saglamak olabilir.

ABD'nin yapabilecegi baska seyler de var elbette. Son gunlerdeki acklamalar, askeri bakmdan onemli yeni kabiliyetlerin devreye sokulmakta olduguna isaret ediyor.

Siber saldrlar

ABD Savunma Bakan Ash Carter, ozellikle Suriye'de ISID'e kars kapsaml siber saldrlar yurutuldugu yonunde imalarda bulundu.

Ash, ""ISID'in komuta ve kontrol gucunu sekteye ugratmak, baglantlar arasnda guven sarsntsna neden olmak, baglantlarna asr yukleme yaparak fonksiyonunu yitirmesini saglamak"" amacyla bu yola basvuruldugunu soyluyor.

General Dunford ise fiziki ve siber savas arasndaki paralleliklere dikkat cekiyor.

""ISID'i hem fiziksel hem de sanal alemde izole etmeye, komuta ve konrtrol kapasitelerini, birbirleriyle iletisim olanaklarn, bolgesel ve taktiksel olarak operasyon yurutme guclerini snrlamaya calsyoruz"" diyor Dunfrod.

Bugune kadar Washington ISID'e kars daha cok havadan mudahale etti. Ama karada da ozel operasyonlarn hzlandgna dair isaretler var.

Birkac gun once ABD Kara Kuvvetleri Ozel Birliklerinin Irak'ta ISID'in onemli bir ismini ele gecirdigi ackland.

Son haftalarda Irak'a gonderilen 200 kisilik Delta komandolar ekibinin yaptg ilk onemli operasyondu bu.

Libya sorunu

ABD ayrca Libya'daki ISID hedeflerine kars aralkl hava saldrlarnda da bulundu. En sonuncusu Subat ortalarnda Ingiltere'deki bir usten kalkan Amerikan savas ucaklar tarafndan yaplms ve ISID'in Trablus'un batsndaki Sabratha yaknlarndaki bir egitim kampn hedeflemisti.

Ama Libya'da da perde arkasnda cok daha fazla seylerin olduguna dair isaretler var.

Avrupa'ya yaknlg ve kanunlardan yoksun haliyle Libya ABD, AB ve NATO icin hzla buyuk bir guvenlik kaygs yaratyor.

ISID baglantl gruplar giderek kok salyor. Herhangi bir operasyona onderlik edebilecek Italya'nn yan sra bircok ulke Libya'daki guvenlik sorunlarna yardmc olma konusunda isteksiz davranyor.

Bat destekli (ABD'nin de muhtemelen onemli bir destek rolu oynayacag) herhangi bir misyon icin gereken kosul, Llibya'daki cesitli gruplar arasnda, bir ulusal birlik hukumeti kurulmas konusunda anlasma saglanmasdr.

Boyle bir anlasma bugune kadar mumkun olmad, ama baz askeri operasyonlar baslad. Subat sonlarnda Fransz Le Monde gazetesi, Fransz kara kuvvetleri ozel birliklerinin Libya'da ""gizli bir savas"" yuruttugunu yazmst.

Fransa hukumeti bu haberleri ve ABD ve Ingiltere ozel birliklerinin de Libya'da olduguna dair diger haberleri tepkiyle karslad.

Ocak aynda ise Italyan yetkililer, Amerikallarn Sicilya'daki Sigonella hava ussunden silahl insansz hava araclar kaldrmas konusunda anlasmst. Bunun, Libya'da bulunan Amerikal birliklerin tehlike annda korunmas amacyla yapldg ima edilmisti.

Libya topraklarnda ne olup bittigini bilmiyoruz - hukumetler ozel kuvvetler tarafndan yurutulen operasyonlar pek acklamazlar - ama bolgesel guvenligi saglamak amacyla baska admlarn atldg kesin.

Tunus hukumeti ayrca, Libya guvenlik guclerinin Tunus'ta egitilmesi icin Almanya ile gorusmeler yurutuyor.

Istikrar sorunu

Simdi ""Iki bucuk cephe savas"" diyebilecegimiz bir savas baslad. ABD, zaman icinde olumlu sonuc alnacagndan emin gorunuyor.

Ama dikkat ederseniz ""zafer"" sozcugunu kullanmyorum.

Zira bu, Suriye, Libya ve Irak gibi ulkelerde istikrarn geri gelmesi, tum kesimleri kapsayan hukumetlerin kurulmas, yolsuzlugun onemli olcude azaltlmas ve radikal Islamclgn yukselmesine neden olan unsurlarn devre ds braklmas demek.

Bolgeye genel olarak baknca, istikrarn geri gelmesine isaret edecek cok sayda olumlu gelisme gormek zor.

bbc.com,,Why is Brazil ex-leader Lula caught up in corruption scandal?,[],"Image copyright AFP Image caption Police searched the offices of the Lula Foundation and the ex-leader's home

In the early hours of 4 March, the home and other properties belonging to Brazil's former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva were raided as part of a huge corruption investigation.

Lula himself was taken to a police station and released after three hours of questioning.

Here we look at how the popular ex-leader has come to be at the centre of a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal that has already seen dozens of lawmakers arrested.

What happened on 4 March?

Image copyright AFP Image caption Lula had hinted recently that he was considering running for president again in 2018

Police knocked on the door of Lula's house in Sao Bernardo do Campo in the greater Sao Paulo area at 06:00 local time (09:00GMT).

Officers took the ex-president in an unmarked car to a police station at Congonhas airport for questioning.

The officers escorting Lula to the police station were acting under a judge's order called a ""conducao coercitiva"" (bench warrant) which means that a person is commanded to appear before authorities to give testimony.

Police searched his house in Sao Bernardo, the offices of the Lula Institute - a non-governmental organisation founded by the ex-leader - and the homes of some of his family members and associates.

In total, 200 police officers enforced 33 search and 11 arrest warrants at locations in three Brazilian states.

What's behind Lula's detention?

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The corruption scandal revolves around contracts awarded by state-owned oil company Petrobras

Lula's detention is part of a long-running investigation into a massive corruption scandal at Brazil's state-owned oil company, Petrobras.

The investigation is called Operation Lava Jato (Car Wash) and was launched by Judge Sergio Moro in March, 2014.

Investigators allege firms and businessmen paid corrupt officials huge bribes in order to secure lucrative Petrobras contracts.

They say that starting in 2003, construction companies formed a cartel to overcharge Petrobras for building contracts.

They would then pay part of their windfall to Petrobras executives and politicians who were in on the deal.

Prosecutors allege that the governing Workers' Party partly financed its campaigns and expenses through these kickbacks.

The scandal has rocked Brazil's political establishment, with top politicians in several parties accused of taking bribes.

Where's Operation Car Wash at?

Image copyright AFP Image caption Lula's detention was headline news on Brazilian channels

The investigation has been under way for almost two years and is in its 24th ""phase"" (a phrase used by investigators when they follow new lines of enquiry).

Top executives at Petrobras and dozens of directors of Brazil's largest construction and engineering firms have been arrested.

Dozens of influential politicians, including the treasurer of the governing Workers' Party, Joao Vaccari Neto, and Lula's former chief of staff, Jose Dirceu, have been arrested.

But it is not just politicians from the governing party who have been linked to the scandal.

President Dilma Rousseff's fiercest rival, lower house speaker Eduardo Cunha of the PMDB party, has also had his home raided by police.

Prosecutors say he took as much as $40m (28m) million in bribes, which he denies.

What's Lula being questioned about?

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The investigation centres on a luxury penthouse in the resort of Guaruja, estimated to be worth up to $550,000

Prosecutors allege Lula received ""illicit benefits"" from the kickbacks scheme, such as having one of the construction firms involved in the scandal renovate a luxury beachfront apartment and a ranch owned by Lula's family.

They say that ""the suspicion is that the improvements and the properties are bribes derived from the illegal gains made by OAS [construction firm] in the Petrobras graft scheme"".

Investigators say they also have evidence that in 2014 the ex-president received at least $270,000 (190,000) worth of furniture and improvements for the beachfront apartment in Guaruja.

They say they are also looking into sums paid to Lula by construction firms involved in the scandal as donations or speaking fees.

Lula has denied any wrongdoing.

What are the implications for the government?

Image copyright AP Image caption The corruption scandal has led to a plummeting in approval ratings of President Rousseff and her predecessor, Lula

Lula was the political mentor of current President Dilma Rousseff.

As early as 2014, President Rousseff acknowledged that ""this [scandal] may change the country forever"".

Ms Rousseff chaired the Petrobras board of directors from 2003 to 2010.

She has denied knowledge of any wrongdoing but many of her critics have questioned how she could not have been aware of such a wide-ranging kickback scheme at Petrobras while she held a senior position at the oil giant.

How have Brazilians reacted?

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Supporters of Lula gathered outside his apartment building

Supporters and opponents of Lula gathered outside Lula's house and the police station where he was being questioned and shouted slogans for and against the former president.

His supporters say Lula's detention is part of a dirty war against the former leader, who recently hinted that he was considering running for president in the 2018 election.

A spokesman for the Lula Foundation called his detention ""an assault against the rule of law that impacts all of Brazilian society"".

But public prosecutor Carlos Fernando dos Santos Lima said that the move showed that no-one was beyond the power of the law in Brazil.

""Anyone in Brazil is subject to be investigated when there are indications of a crime,"" he said.

What's been the effect on the Brazilian economy?

Image copyright AFP Image caption Brazilians say they are fed up with corruption and disillusioned with the political establishment

In the immediate aftermath of Lula's detention, markets rallied.

Brazil's currency gained more than 3% against the dollar and shares in Petrobras surged by 14%.

Analysts said traders were betting on the possibility of a new coalition taking over power which could be more market-friendly than the current government led by President Rousseff.

But so far the corruption scandals besetting the country have proven very costly.

Last year, Petrobras revealed it had lost $2bn in corruption-related costs.

And on 3 March official figures showed that Brazil's GDP had contracted by 3.8% in 2015, a worse performance than almost any other major economy.

While this is partly due to low commodity prices and sluggish global growth, continuing news of corruption at the highest levels has deterred some investors and angered the Brazilian public, analysts say.",[]

bbc.com,,How to Survive a Nuclear Bomb,[],"How to Survive a Nuclear Bomb

We ask Lisa Mac Hale, Head of Development BBC History and Business, about the idea

Tell us about the idea

How To Survive A Nuclear Attack is a new approach to history content designed for 16-24 year olds - a mixed genre animation/live action interactive narrative based the recently declassified British government war game Exercise Regenerate from 1982. Informed by the history of the Cold War nuclear threat, the narrative encourages a player to make difficult decisions to ensure their survival in the wake of a nuclear attack on Britain.

Can you set up the story for us?

The narrative is spread across three days and three nights, beginning just moments before the bombs drop and ending with a rescue by the military on the morning of Day Four. In the intervening time, the government is in hiding and the authorities are crippled. Our player is on their own.

In the course of making decisions, players must avoid being exposed to dangerous situations and radiation that will cause their health and/or morale to deteriorate and potentially result in death. They can also make choices that might improve their health and/or morale, and thereby contribute to their chances of survival. The players health and morale levels are measured onscreen throughout the experience, and their score is assessed at the end of each day  with the potential that they might die on any evening. At the end of the narrative they will be given a total score, and they can choose to re-play at any time to improve their score.

All situations within the game are drawn from fact or expertly informed projections. In addition to Exercise Regenerate our sources include eyewitness accounts of the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, other Cold War preparation exercises such as WINTEX-CIMEX 83, and expert calculations and plans for how Britain would face the aftermath of a nuclear onslaught.

What features make this stand out?

How To Survive a Nuclear Bomb is a scrolling parallex graphic novel which moves upon the user prompting. Interactive decision moments and a game mechanic in which the user steers the course of the story and influences whether they will survive to the end. This creates a stylish yet cost effective way of creating a story for young audiences. We think this allows the user to put themselves at the heart of a story which plays out according to the choices they make. The survival game mechanic also provides repeat playability.

There is also embedded video content which is an interesting contrast to the graphic novel and adds real emotional impact to the story.

At the end of each day you can review a 'secret dossier' containing information relating to points within the story and the consequences of the decision made by the user. Hoodwink history' relates the events from the story back to historical fact or documentation.

To find out, we turned to question-and-answer site Quora, where users have been sharing their opinions on real places that look plucked from a fairy tale.

From an enchanting Alpine palace in Germany that rivals Cinderellas castle to a postcard-perfect English landscape that inspired Beatrix Potter and JRR Tolkien  these seven dreamy destinations are so magical, its hard to believe theyre real.

A giant patchwork quilt of kaleidoscopic colour

Hollands stunning tulip fields, with their broad stripes of vibrant blues, reds, pinks and yellows, look like the artwork in a children's book, wrote Quora user Rahul Shankar. He added that this coastal region of the Netherlands strangely reminded [him] of the Wizard of Oz.

Its a modern pastime to circle the flower farms on foot, bike or via caravan, and the tulips have a rich, storied history. The flowers were imported into Holland in the 16th Century and peaked in popularity in the 17th Century  during the Dutch Golden Age  when they grew so coveted they created the worlds first economic bubble: Tulip Mania.

The most popular fields are located in western Holland between the cities of Leiden and Den Helder. Others are situated near the city of Enkhuizen and in the nearby province of Flevoland.

More than three billion tulips are grown in Holland each year, attracting tens of thousands of visitors each year. Tulip season spans from March until August, giving travellers plenty of time to view the vibrant display.

A fantastical figment of Gaudis otherworldly imagination

With its intricate symbolic sculptures, monumental medallion-capped spires and wildly imaginative carved facades, the Sagrada Familia rises from Barcelonas urban setting like an elaborate Gothic castle ripe with stories, spirits and secrets.

Designed by one of Spains most famed architects, Antoni Gaudi, the history of this Roman Catholic church and Unesco World Heritage Site is a legend in itself. Construction began in 1882, but less than a quarter of the project was complete when Gaudi died in 1926. Since then, work has progressed slowly, disrupted by the Spanish Civil War, a fire and a series of contentious controversies. The happy ending? Architects plan to complete the project in 2026, the centenary of Gaudis death.

Barcelonas most popular tourist site attracts three million visitors annually, and for good reason: its a dizzyingly elaborate masterpiece unlike anything else in the world. Which is why, according to Aditya Pandya, it has put Barcelona on the map.

Anyone who is familiar with Gaudi's work would appreciate his brazen and imaginative designs that left a lasting impression on Barcelona as a city, Pandya wrote. Gaudi's phenomenal work between the late 1880s and 1920s is largely responsible for the city's vibrant personality and in being recognised as the cultural capital of Spain.

A setting that could steal the spotlight from any storybook hero

With its postcard-perfect valleys surrounded by glittering lakes, burbling brooks, rolling hills and craggy peaks, the Lake District in Englands northwest is quite literally taken out of fairy tales.

This place was JRR Tolkien's inspiration for the Shire, Beatrix Potter's inspiration for Peter Rabbit and eponymous residence of the Lake Poets, including William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey, Jeff Chau wrote.

Each year, 16 million visitors come to the 2,292sqkm Cumbrian national park for its lake cruises, mountain hikes and awe-inspiring sightseeing. For city-dwellers especially, it can seem like stepping into a storybook realm of undulating fells, whitewashed cottages and stonewalled fields where ponies roam.

One of natures most magical optical illusions

Once upon a time in the faraway land of the Faroe Islands, glittering Lake Srvagsvatn (also known as Lake Leitisvatn) became known as the most striking of all of the islands lakes.

At more than 6km long, it is the biggest in the Faroe Islands. And as the star of a clever optical illusion, the lake appears as if its resting hundreds of metres above the sea, with the ocean churning beneath its placid waters.

But nature can be deceiving, explained Aneesh Wairagade. In reality, Lake Srvagsvatn is actually no more than about 30m above sea level. A steep cliff in front of the lake and a clever camera angle make the lake appear to be much higher than it really is.

Visit the 18 rocky, volcanic islands connected by tunnels, ferries, causeways and bridges, and view Mother Natures oddest optical illusion on the island of Vagar. The islands are also home to other natural attractions, such as rare birds, dramatic coastal cliffs and grassy meadows dotted with sheep.

The ultimate cliff hanger

Jutting out dramatically above the reflective waters of Lysefjord, the spectacular precipice of Preikestolen in Ryfylke, Norway, could be the setting for any mythic Hollywood epic.

Also known as Preachers Pulpit or Pulpit Rock because it resembles a lectern, Preikestolen is a rocky 25m by 25m rocky plateau that towers 604m above the crystal-clear waters below. According to Derek Harkness, it looks like something from the Roadrunner cartoons.

The steep cliff was formed during the Ice Age about 10,000 years ago, when the edges of a glacier bumped up against the surrounding mountains. Water from the glacier penetrated the crevices of the mountain and froze, eventually breaking off colossal portions. Left behind was the dramatic precipice of Preikestolen.

Ice Age-era cracks in the plateau will eventually expand and fragment Pulpit Rock into a pile of rubble  but, according to geological investigations, not in the foreseeable future.

If I were a princess, I would want my castle to look like this

If you dont believe in fairy tales, you will after you set eyes on Neuschwanstein Castle. An enchanting Romanesque Revival fortress that rises majestically from the Alpine foothills of southwest Bavaria, this picture-perfect palace is rumoured to be the inspiration behind Sleeping Beautys Castle in Disneyland and Cinderellas Castle in Disneyworld.

Straight from the dreams of little princesses across the globe, this magical palace has everything a fairy tale castle should: a romantic setting, a glowing limestone facade, fanciful turrets and an elaborate interior featuring shining suits of armour.

It seriously looks like Prince Charming and his lovely wife are going to step right out of the front door to greet you, wrote Danielle Maurer. If I were a princess, I would want my castle to look like this.

In reality, the castle was originally commissioned as a personal retreat in 1869 by King Ludwig II, the reclusive ruler of Bavaria. Immediately after his death in 1886, it was opened to the public and today more than 1.3 million tourists visit each year.

A zany Alice in Wonderland creation, reflected in a fun-house mirror

This isn't an illustration in a fairy tale book; this is a real house, wrote Bruce Feldman, describing Polands fantastically topsy-turvy Krzywy Domek, or Crooked House.

With its undulating roofline and warped windows and doors, this 4,000sqm building was inspired by the fairy tale illustrations of [prolific childrens book illustrator] Jan Marcin Szancer and the work of artist Per Dahlberg, Feldman explained. The vertigo-inducing building in the seaside resort town of Sopot houses a shopping centre, restaurants and a radio station, and draws thousands of tourists each year to see the modern architectural marvel for themselves.",[]

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,Ideias para mudar o mundo: dar voz as mulheres,[],"Ha mais de tres milenios, quando as civilizacoes comecaram a escrever suas proprias leis, uma das questoes debatidas era quando e como as mulheres podiam falar.

A historiadora Amanda Foreman conta que os codigos civilizatorios que datavam de 2.400 a.C.  registros encontrados onde hoje e o Iraque  diziam que ""se uma mulher falar quando nao for sua vez, seus dentes serao esmagados por um tijolo"".

Essa ameaca evidencia mais ou menos como essa questao foi vista ao longo dos seculos.

No mundo atual, o direito da mulher de falar e garantido em lei em muitas partes do mundo, mas sera que ha equilibrio entre as vozes dadas a homens e mulheres?

Os Estados Unidos, por exemplo, onde os direitos das mulheres evoluiram consideravelmente, um estudo das universidades Princeton e Brigham Young revela que, apesar dos inumeros avancos femininos em termos de representatividade na sociedade, os comandos de empresas geralmente sao dominados por homens.

A pesquisa observou 94 grupos mistos de pelo menos cinco pessoas em salas de reunioes.

Chris Karpowitz e Tali Mendelberg, autores do estudo, concluiram que ""o tempo que as mulheres falavam era significativamente menor do que a representacao proporcional delas  cerca de 75% menos do que o tempo que homens falavam"".

""Mulheres tem algo muito peculiar e importante para acrescentar ao grupo"", os pesquisadores disseram, ""e isso esta sendo perdido, pelo menos em algumas circunstancias"". Raizes

Alguns estudiosos argumentam que a o papel dominante dos homens sobre as mulheres em discussoes tem suas raizes na infancia, quando meninos e meninas assumem, na maioria das vezes de maneira inconsciente, os diferentes papeis que se espera deles.

Um estudo nos Estados Unidos com criancas entre 2 e 5 anos descobriu que pais normalmente interrompiam os filhos mais do que maes, e que ambos interrompiam mais as meninas do que os meninos.

No livro Mulheres, Homens e a Lingua, a professora de Linguistica Jennifer Coates diz que ""a mensagem implicita para as meninas e que elas sao mais suscetiveis a interrupcoes e que o direito de falar e menor para elas do que e para os meninos"".

Para acabar com esse desequilibrio, algumas mulheres estao propondo novas medidas.

'Ideia para mudar o mundo'

A BBC convidou artistas, escritores e cientistas para sugerirem, cada um, uma ideia simples e imediata que pudesse provocar mudancas no mundo.

No terceiro video da serie, Silja Bara Omarsdottir, do Centro de Igualdade de Genero na Universidade da Islandia, sugere que pelo menos por uma vez no ano nenhum homem possa falar em uma reuniao antes de ter ouvido uma opiniao feminina sobre a questao.

Ela diz que uma mulher tende a esperar sua vez para falar, mas homens nao tem essa percepcao e sempre comecam a dizer algo antes que ela possa abrir a boca.

Uma professora canadense tomou essa atitude em sua sala de aula. Judy Haiven da aulas de gerenciamento de negocios na Universidade Saint Mary e afirma que nunca deixa homens falarem primeiro em sua sala. Ela acredita que essa proposta poderia ser adaptada em outros lugares para evitar que homens monopolizem os foruns publicos.

Mas nem todos concordam que uma intervencao como essa seja justa ou efetiva para resolver essa questao. A professora britanica Mary Beard afirma que nao ha solucao rapida para igualar as vozes de mulheres e homens ao mesmo nivel de autoridade.

""Esses preconceitos estao intrinsecos em nossa cultura, nossa lingua, e em seculos e em milenios de nossa historia. Se nao reconhecermos isso, nunca resolveremos o problema de vez.""",[]

Las miradas de terror de los numerosos espectadores sentados alrededor de Landon Cunningham daban una idea de la gravedad de la situacion.

Un pequeno nino de ocho anos, distraido con un telefono celular, estaba en el punto de mira de la fuerza devastadora de un bate volador que se dirigia directamente a su cara.

Pero cuando el contacto parecia inminente, surgio el brazo heroico de su papa.

Fue una fraccion de segundo, lo justo para que Shaun Cunningham fuera capaz de desviar el bate descontrolado del jugador de los Piratas de Pittsburgh Danny Ortiz y asi salvar a su hijo Landon, quien estaba cumpliendo 9 anos y asistia a su primer partido de beisbol.

""No hubo mucho tiempo para pensar. Solo reaccione"".

Ocurre cada dos a siete anos, cuando las aguas calidas de la region central del oceano Pacifico se expanden hacia el este, acercandose a las costas de Sudamerica.

El Nino suele llegar a su momento mas algido a finales de ano, pero los efectos de este fenomeno meteorologico pueden sentirse hasta los 12 meses siguientes.

La Organizacion Meteorologica Mundial dijo que el proximo podria ser el peor en mas de 60 anos, y, segun la NASA, sentiremos sus efectos en todo el mundo.

Pero las consecuencias van mas alla de las ya de por si preocupantes sequias, oceanos crecidos y altas temperaturas.

Con los problemas medioambientales vienen tambien epidemias y enfermedades.

Y, segun las ultimas investigaciones, estas viajan a traves del agua, en forma de bacterias marinas que pueden suponer un grave peligro para la poblacion.

Bacterias marinas

Image copyright Universidad de Bath

Image copyright Universidad de Bath Image caption La comparacion entre los datos de 1997 y 2015 pone de manifiesto los ""extraordinarios efectos"" de El Nino.

Segun una investigacion de cientificos britanicos y estadounidenses, publicada recientemente por la revista cientifica Nature Microbiology, El Nino podria contribuir a la transmision y propagacion de enfermedades transmitidas por el agua, como el colera, ""con importantes consecuencias para la salud publica"".

Los expertos descubrieron que la llegada de ciertas infecciones y enfermedades bacterianas coincidio, en el tiempo y en el espacio, con el fenomeno climatologico.

Trabajando conjuntamente con el Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) de Peru, los cientificos observaron como algunas enfermedades causadas por bacterias marinas coincidian con la llegada de El Nino a la costa de America Latina.

Image copyright Getty Image caption El Nino no solo puede traer sequias e inundaciones, sino tambien otro tipo de problemas.

""Lo importante de esta investigacion es que descubrimos que El Nino trae aguas calientes a Peru, convirtiendolo en un pais tropical y provocando lluvias e inundaciones"", le conto a BBC Mundo Jaime Martinez-Urtaza, autor principal del estudio y profesor en la Universidad de Bath (Reino Unido), desde donde investiga el fenomeno.

""El Nino provoca enfermedades de forma indirecta, creando condiciones para la reproduccion de mosquitos que transmiten malaria, dengue y zika"", explico.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Las consecuencias van mas alla de las lluvias torrenciales y las inundaciones.

Ecuador, Peru y Bolivia sufrieron serias epidemias de malaria despues de fuertes lluvias causadas por El Nino en 1983, advirtio la Organizacion Mundial de la Salud (OMS).

Ademas, la OMS reporto que en 1997 ""las sequias que trajo El Nino a Malasia, Indonesia y Brasil agravaron los incendios forestales, y la inhalacion del humo fue un problema de salud publica en esos paises, causando problemas respiratorios en mucha gente"".

Pero los cientificos han descubierto que El Nino tambien transmite enfermedades ""de forma directa, a traves de bacterias que viajan en el mar"", segun Martinez-Urtaza.

Como se desplazan estas bacterias y por que este hallazgo puede ser tan importante?

Colera e infecciones

Image copyright thinkstock Image caption Las bacterias viajan en el agua, uniendose a organismos mas grandes.

""El Nino puede convertirse en un pasillo temporal comunicando Asia con America"", dijo Martinez-Urtaza, explicando como las bacterias podrian viajar de un continente a otro, a traves de los oceanos.

""Desde el punto de vista biologico, esto abriria una ventana a la entrada de variantes geneticas de distancias enormes"".

Segun la investigacion en la que tambien participaron expertos de la Administracion Nacional Oceanica y Atmosferica de los Estados Unidos (NOAA, por sus siglas en ingles), y de la Administracion de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA) en las tres ultimas decadas surgieron nuevas variantes de patogenos en Latinoamerica, coincidiendo con los tres episodios mas significativos de El Nino (199091, 199798 y 2010).

Y esto incluye un devastador brote de colera que se produjo en Peru en 1990 y que causo mas de 13.000 muertes.

Otros casos llamativos se produjeron en 1997 y 2010, cuando dos variantes de una bacteria 'Vibrio parahaemolyticus' provocaron infecciones causadas por el consumo de marisco contaminado.

Y precisamente en Peru, el marisco crudo o ceviche es un alimento altamente consumido por los habitantes de la costa.

""Corrientes biologicas""

Image copyright thinkstock Image caption Viajan con las corrientes marinas, transportando enfermedades.

Segun Martinez-Urtaza, ""los vibrios pueden adherirse a organismos mas grandes, como el zooplancton, para viajar a traves de los oceanos"".

""Varios estudios demostraron como los vibrios utilizan estos organismos como fuente de energia y, a traves de este mecanismo, son capaces de portar enfermedades, impulsados por las corrientes oceanicas"", explico.

""Los efectos de El Nino y su impacto en el clima local, la pesca y el riesgo de otros fenomenos meteorologicos mas extremos ya estan bien documentados"", dijo Martinez-Urtaza.

""Entender como las corrientes oceanicas estan jugando tambien un papel fundamental en el transporte de estas enfermedades tiene un importante significado para las campanas de salud publica de esos paises"", agrego.

Ademas, Craig Baker-Austinfrom, del Laboratorio del Centro para el Medio Ambiente, la Pesca y la Acuicultura de Weymouth (Reino Unido), y coautor del estudio, dice que El Nino podria suponer ""un corredor biologico, que permita el desplazamiento de organismos marinos desde areas lejanas"".

Este proceso, segun el cientifico, ""podria proporcionar una fuente unica de nuevos patogenos en America, con serias implicaciones en cuanto a la propagacion y el control de la enfermedad"".

Para Martinez-Urtaza, la solucion mas inmediata pasa por mantener el nivel de alerta e invertir mas en investigacion, algo que, asegura, no se hace lo suficiente en paises como Peru.

""Hay que evaluar el impacto de esas bacterias y tomar muestras para analizarlas y detectar variantes. El impacto a nivel biologico podria ser enorme"", advirtio.",[]

bbc.com,,Japan's tsunami debris: Five remarkable stories,[],"Image copyright NOAA

It was a gloomy, grey day in the middle of the Pacific Ocean in the summer of 2012. There was a small white blip, persistent on the horizon.

At first they thought it was a whale, but as they got closer they realised it was a large abandoned fishing boat with Japanese characters on the side.

""That is when everything changed. This belonged to someone, this is someone's property,"" recalls Marcus Eriksen, a marine conservationist who led a 2012 expedition to survey the vast volume of debris cast into the ocean by a massive earthquake-triggered tsunami that hit Japan's north-eastern coast on 11 March 2011.

The disaster killed almost 16,000 people and saw a vast amount of material washed out to sea - about 20 million tonnes, the Japanese government has estimated.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Whole towns were washed away in the disaster

Much of it sank, but five years on some of it is still washing up along the North American coast, from Alaska to Hawaii. Since September 2015, 64 items have been washed ashore and officially identified as tsunami debris.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Debris Programme, based in Hawaii, has worked closely with the Japanese government, through local consulates, to identify these items. In the years since the disaster there have been extraordinary stories of objects washing up on these distant shores, some of which have later been reconciled with their owners.

Motorcycle

Image copyright NOAA

A Harley-Davidson motorcycle was found on Graham Island, in British Columbia in Canada, in the container that its Japanese owner, Ikio Yokohama, had used to store it back in Japan.

Peter Mark, the man who discovered it in April 2012, realised it had a Japanese number plate attached and might be tsunami debris, and so it was traced.

Media caption Ikio Yokoyama: ""When I looked at the picture he took, I knew immediately it was my bike""

After considering offers to ship the bike back to Japan to be restored, its owner decided it should be exhibited at the Harley-Davidson Museum in Milwaukee, USA, as a memorial to those whose lives were touched by the disaster.

Mr Yokoyama lost several family members himself in the tsunami.

Village sign

Image copyright NOAA

Tanohata village was devastated by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Much of the town in Iwate prefecture was swept out into the ocean.

Among that sea of debris was a wooden sign. Nearly three metres (10 feet) long, it bore the name of the wooden apartment building it came from - ""Shimanokoshi village housing"".

It was found in October 2013, some 6,000 km (3,728 miles) away, on Kahuku Beach, Oahu Island, Hawaii. And in July 2014 it was flown home.

Image copyright NOAA Image caption US state and federal authorities co-operated in the return of the sign

With its return, the people of the village ""are slowly but surely walking on the path to recovery as a united body"", said its mayor, Hiroshi Ishihara.

The village has exhibited the sign, as a reminder for future generations.

Football

Misaki Murakami, 16, lost everything he owned when the tsunami swept away his home in Rikuzentakata.

But little more than a year later, on the shores of Middleton Island, Alaska, David and Yumi Baxter found a football that he had been given by classmates when he moved schools several years before. Being Japanese, Ms Baxter was able to translate the name, school and ""good luck"" message on the ball, helping to reunite it with its owner.

Media caption Survivor talks about recovering football taken to Alaska after tsunami

""I was shocked, but also I've yet to recover a single one of my belongings, so I'm really happy about this,"" said Misaki on recovering the ball.

Rowing boat

Image copyright NOAA

A rowing boat, or skiff, was found on 7 April 2013 on the shores of Crescent City, California.

The boat, called Kamome (Seagull), belonged to a high school in Rikuzentakata, which was completely flattened by the wave that hit the town just over two years before.

Image copyright Del Norte High School

Cleaning it of the barnacles that covered it, pupils at Del Norte High School worked with officials in Japan and the US to ship it home.

The two schools arranged exchange visits and formally became sister schools. The story of the boat, and the links it helped forge, has even been told in a bilingual illustrated book for young children.

Fishing boat

Image copyright NOAA

One piece of debris which was especially visible, but could not be salvaged, was the crewless ""ghost ship"", which was first spotted off the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia on 23 March 2012, slowly drifting in a maritime transport corridor.

Because of the risk the 164-foot (50-metre) Ryou-Un Maru posed to other shipping, and the difficulties of salvaging it, authorities were left with little choice but to scuttle it.

The squid fishing vessel was sunk about 314 km (195 miles) from Sitka, Alaska, by naval cannon fire.

Image copyright US Coast Guard Image caption It took several bursts of cannon fire to sink the ship

While the biggest items have received the most attention, the vast majority of the debris was smaller, and is getting gradually more so the longer it is at sea.

It is also makes up a large proportion of what remains in the Pacific, as much of it is entirely or mostly sub-surface debris. The items submerged below the water line can only be moved by currents. Some of these items have accumulated in an area called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a long-standing collection of marine debris.

So the impact of the tsunami is still being felt and measured thousands of miles away from its original focus. People find the objects, scientists log them, oceanographers model them and conservationists assess their impact.

With every object that is found, scientists are given an opportunity to learn more about currents, winds and ocean flow, but the debris also tells stories about the lives touched by the 2011 tsunami.

Singapore has again been judged as the world's most expensive city but costs across the world have been highly volatile, according to researchers.

The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) ranked Singapore as the priciest ahead of Zurich, Hong Kong, Geneva and Paris.

London was sixth and New York seventh on the list that compares the cost of a basket of goods across 133 cities.

The cheapest were Lusaka, the capital of Zambia, followed by Bangalore and Mumbai in India, the EIU said.

Volatility

The EIU charts the expense of cities by comparing them to the cost of living in New York.

Although Singapore was the most expensive, the cost of living there was 10% cheaper when compared to New York than was the case in the EIU survey a year ago.

Researchers said they saw considerable movement in the rankings as cities coped with economic factors ranging from the strength of the US dollar and currency devaluations to falling oil and commodity prices and geopolitical uncertainty.

""In nearly 17 years of working on this survey I can't recall a year as volatile as 2015,"" said Jon Copestake, an editor of the survey,

""Falling commodity prices have created deflationary pressures in some countries, but in others currency weakness caused by these falls has led to spiralling inflation.""

The EIU said India and Pakistan accounted for five of the 10 least expensive cities in the world.",[]

Essa e uma questao que esta em debate ha decadas e que continua a dividir opinioes em muitos paises ao redor do mundo. As salas de aula tradicionais tem sido desafiadas por metodos mais modernos. Algumas pessoas defendem que a experiencia com ""objetos"" e a chave para o melhor aprendizado.

Uma serie de estudos do Centro de Ensino da Universidade Columbia, nos Estados Unidos, mapeou as dificuldades de envolver os alunos e descobriu que eles conseguiam se manter atentos por apenas 40% do tempo de uma aula normal.

Mais para o final da atividade, quase ninguem mais estava prestando atencao. Os estudantes que participaram da pesquisa conseguiram reter somente 20% do conteudo transmitido nos ultimos 10 minutos. E eles ficavam rapidamente entediados.

Se esses estudos estiverem certos, e bem possivel que o tempo que muitos alunos passam na escola esteja sendo desperdicado.

Entre as propostas para mudar isso esta a sugestao de tirar os alunos de sua zona de conforto e transforma-los em agentes ativos - processo muitas vezes chamado de ""aprendizado pela experiencia"".

Um dos fatores-chave e a crenca de que a alta dependencia de textos em livros diminui o interesse dos alunos nas materias e faz com que eles nao se envolvam de maneira criativa e interativa.

O sociologo americano James W. Loewen, autor do livro My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong (Meu professor me contou: Tudo o que esta errado no seu livro de historia americana), opina que ""textos de Historia sao muito previsiveis; todo problema ja foi resolvido ou esta perto de ser resolvido. Os livros excluem conflitos ou qualquer suspense (da narrativa)"".

Projeto

Um projeto educacional no Reino Unido que tem como objetivo fugir do ensino centrado apenas em livros teve sua inspiracao em uma serie da BBC, ""A History of the World in 100 Objects"" (A historia do mundo em 100 objetos).

A serie trazia historias por tras de centenas de objetos exibidos no Museu Britanico, de civilizacoes antigas ate a era moderna.

O projeto ""Ensinando Historia com 100 objetos"" foi o resultado de uma colaboracao entre museus no Reino Unido - o projeto foi financiado pelo Departamento de Educacao para ""aproveitar o poder dos objetos para motivar o interesse de jovens na historia e para estimular novas ideias de ensino"".

Mas a efetividade de novos metodos de ensino ainda tem sido testada e nao e unanimidade entre estudiosos.

Abu Anis only realised something unusual was happening when he heard the sound of explosions coming from the old city on the western bank of the Tigris as it runs through Mosul.

""I phoned some friends over there, and they said armed groups had taken over, some of them foreign, some Iraqis,"" the computer technician said. ""The gunmen told them, 'We've come to get rid of the Iraqi army, and to help you.'""

The following day, the attackers crossed the river and took the other half of the city. The Iraqi army and police, who vastly outnumbered their assailants, broke and fled, officers first, many of the soldiers stripping off their uniforms as they joined a flood of panicked civilians.

It was 10 June 2014, and Iraq's second biggest city, with a population of around two million, had just fallen to the militants of the group then calling itself Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant (Isis or Isil).

Four days earlier, black banners streaming, a few hundred of the Sunni militants had crossed the desert border in a cavalcade from their bases in eastern Syria and met little resistance as they moved towards their biggest prize.

Rich dividends were immediate. The Iraqi army, rebuilt, trained and equipped by the Americans since the US-led invasion of 2003, abandoned large quantities of armoured vehicles and advanced weaponry, eagerly seized by the militants. They also reportedly grabbed something like $500m from the Central Bank's Mosul branch.

How rich is IS?

Despite territorial losses, IS survives, thanks in no small part to its status as ""the best-funded terrorist organisation"" in history. While most people decry the validity inferred from the name of IS as a ""state"", the group's financing is certainly more reminiscent of a state than that of organisations such as al-Qaeda that relied heavily on donations to fund their operations.

Islamic State: The struggle to stay rich

""At the beginning, they behaved well,"" said Abu Anis. ""They took down all the barricades the army had put up between quarters. People liked that. On their checkpoints they were friendly and helpful - 'Anything you need, we're here for you.'""

The Mosul honeymoon was to last a few weeks. But just down the road, terrible things were already happening.

As the Iraqi army collapsed throughout the north, the militants moved swiftly down the Tigris river valley. Towns and villages fell like skittles. Within a day they had captured the town of Baiji and its huge oil refinery, and moved on swiftly to seize Saddam Hussein's old hometown, Tikrit, a Sunni hotbed.

Just outside Tikrit is a big military base, taken over by the Americans in 2003 and renamed Camp Speicher after the first US casualty in the 1991 ""Desert Storm"" Gulf war against Iraq, a pilot called Scott Speicher, shot down over al-Anbar province in the west.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bodies being exhumed at Camp Speicher, 2015

Camp Speicher, by now full of Iraqi military recruits, was surrounded by the Isis militants and surrendered. The thousands of captives were sorted, the Shia were weeded out, bound, and trucked away to be systematically shot dead in prepared trenches. Around 1,700 are believed to have been massacred in cold blood. The mass graves are still being exhumed.

Far from trying to cover up the atrocity, Isis revelled in it, posting on the internet videos and pictures showing the Shia prisoners being taken away and shot by the black-clad militants.

In terms of exultant cruelty and brutality, worse was not long in coming.

After a pause of just two months, Isis - now rebranded as ""Islamic State"" (IS) - erupted again, taking over large areas of northern Iraq controlled by the Kurds.

That included the town of Sinjar, mainly populated by the Yazidis, an ancient religious minority regarded by IS as heretics.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Yazidi women in Germany protest against IS attacks on their community in northern Iraq, 2014

Hundreds of Yazidi men who failed to escape were simply killed. Women and children were separated and taken away as war booty, to be sold and bartered as chattels, and used as sex slaves. Thousands are still missing, enduring that fate.

Deliberately shocking, bloodthirsty exhibitionism reached a climax towards the end of the same month, August 2014.

IS issued a video showing its notorious, London-accented and now late executioner Mohammed Emwazi (sardonically nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" by former captives) gruesomely beheading American journalist James Foley.

In the following weeks, more American and British journalists and aid workers - Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, and Peter Kassig (who had converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul Rahman) - appeared being slaughtered in similar, slickly produced videos, replete with propaganda statements and dire warnings.

Image caption Murdered Western hostages: (From top left clockwise) Steven Sotloff, David Haines, James Foley, Alan Henning, Abdul Rahman (Peter) Kassig

In the space of a few months, IS had blasted its way from obscurity on to the centre of the world stage. Almost overnight, it became a household word.

Seven-and-a-half thousand miles (12,000km) away, then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott summed up the breathtaking novelty of the horror. It was, he said ""medieval barbarism, perpetrated and spread with the most modern of technology"".

IS had arrived, and the world was taking notice. But the men in black did not appear out of the blue. They had been a long time coming.

The theology of murder

The ideological or religious roots of IS and like-minded groups go deep into history, almost to the beginning of Islam itself in the 7th Century AD.

Like Christianity six centuries before it, and Judaism some eight centuries before that, Islam was born into the harsh, tribal world of the Middle East.

""The original texts, the Old Testament and the Koran, reflected primitive tribal Jewish and Arab societies, and the codes they set forth were severe,"" writes the historian and author William Polk.

""They aimed, in the Old Testament, at preserving and enhancing tribal cohesion and power and, in the Koran, at destroying the vestiges of pagan belief and practice. Neither early Judaism nor Islam allowed deviation. Both were authoritarian theocracies.""

As history moved on, Islam spread over a vast region, encountering and adjusting to numerous other societies, faiths and cultures. Inevitably in practice it mutated in different ways, often becoming more pragmatic and indulgent, often given second place to the demands of power and politics and temporal rulers.

For hardline Muslim traditionalists this amounted to deviationism, and from early on, there was a clash of ideas in which those arguing for a strict return to the ""purity"" of the early days of Islam often paid a price.

The eminent scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780-855), who founded one of the main schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, was jailed and once flogged unconscious in a dispute with the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad. Nearly five centuries later, another supreme theologian of the same strict orthodox school, Ibn Taymiyya, died in prison in Damascus.

These two men are seen as the spiritual forefathers of later thinkers and movements which became known as ""salafist"", advocating a return to the ways of the first Muslim ancestors, the salaf al-salih (righteous ancestors).

They inspired a later figure whose thinking and writings were to have a huge and continuing impact on the region and on the salafist movement, one form of which, Wahhabism, took his name.

Media caption How so-called Islamic State started - In 3 minutes

Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was born in 1703 in a small village in the Nejd region in the middle of the Arabian peninsula.

A devout Islamic scholar, he espoused and developed the most puritanical and strict version of what he saw as the original faith, and sought to spread it by entering pacts with the holders of political and military power.

In an early foray in that direction, his first action was to destroy the tomb of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, one of the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, on the grounds that by the austere doctrine of salafist theology, the veneration of tombs constitutes shirk, the revering of something or someone other than Allah.

But it was in 1744 that Abd al-Wahhab made his crucial alliance with the local ruler, Muhammad ibn Saud. It was a pact whereby Wahhabism provided the spiritual or ideological dimension for Saudi political and military expansion, to the benefit of both.

Passing through several mutations, that dual alliance took over most of the peninsula and has endured to this day, with the House of Saud ruling in sometimes uneasy concert with an ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment.

The entrenchment of Wahhabi salafism in Saudi Arabia - and the billions of petrodollars to which it gained access - provided one of the wellsprings for jihadist militancy in the region in modern times. Jihad means struggle on the path of Allah, which can mean many kinds of personal struggle, but more often is taken to mean waging holy war.

But the man most widely credited, or blamed, for bringing salafism into the 20th Century was the Egyptian thinker Sayyid Qutb. He provided a direct bridge from the thought and heritage of Abd al-Wahhab and his predecessors to a new generation of jihadist militants, leading up to al-Qaeda and all that was to follow.

Image copyright Creative Commons Image caption Sayyid Qutb, ""the source of all jihadist thought""

Born in a small village in Upper Egypt in 1906, Sayyid Qutb found himself at odds with the way Islam was being taught and managed around him. Far from converting him to the ways of the West, a two-year study period in the US in the late 1940s left him disgusted at what he judged unbridled godless materialism and debauchery, and his fundamentalist Islamic outlook was honed harder.

Back in Egypt, he developed the view that the West was imposing its control directly or indirectly over the region in the wake of the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War One, with the collaboration of local rulers who might claim to be Muslims, but who had in fact deviated so far from the right path that they should no longer be considered such.

For Qutb, offensive jihad against both the West and its local agents was the only way for the Muslim world to redeem itself. In essence, this was a kind of takfir - branding another Muslim an apostate or kafir (infidel), making it justified and even obligatory and meritorious to kill him.

Although he was a theorist and intellectual rather than an active jihadist, Qutb was judged dangerously subversive by the Egyptian authorities. He was hanged in 1966 on charges of involvement in a Muslim Brotherhood plot to assassinate the nationalist President, Gamal Abdel Nasser.

Qutb was before his time, but his ideas lived on in the 24 books he wrote, which have been read by tens of millions, and in the personal contact he had with the circles of people like Ayman al-Zawahiri, another Egyptian who is the current al-Qaeda leader.

Another intimate of the al-Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden said: ""Qutb was the one who most affected our generation."" He has also been described as ""the source of all jihadist thought"", and ""the philosopher of the Islamic revolution"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 9/11: The attackers were influenced by Qutb's writings

More than 35 years after he was hanged, the official commission of inquiry into al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in 2001 concluded: ""Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalise even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defence of an embattled faith.""

And his influence lingers on today. Summing up the roots of IS and its predecessors, the Iraqi expert on Islamist movements Hisham al-Hashemi said: ""They are founded on two things: a takfiri faith based on the writings of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and as methodology, the way of Sayyid Qutb.""

The theology of militant jihadism was in place. But to flourish, it needed two things - a battlefield, and strategists to shape the battle.

Afghanistan was to provide the opportunity for both.

Rise of al-Qaeda

The Soviet invasion in 1979, and the 10 years of occupation that followed, provided a magnet for would-be jihadists from around the Arab world. Some 35,000 of them flocked to Afghanistan during that period, to join the jihad and help the mainly Islamist Afghan mujahedeen guerrillas turn the country into Russia's Vietnam.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Soviet forces in Afghanistan, 1980

There is little evidence that the ""Afghan Arabs"", as they became known, played a pivotal combat role in driving the Soviets out. But they made a major contribution in setting up support networks in Pakistan, channelling funds from Saudi Arabia and other donors, and funding schools and militant training camps. It was a fantastic opportunity for networking and forging enduring relationships as well as tasting jihad first hand.

Ironically, they found themselves on the same team as the Americans. The CIA's Operation Cyclone channelled hundreds of millions of dollars through Pakistan to militant Afghan mujahedeen leaders such as Golbuddin Hekmatyar, who associated closely with the Arab jihadists.

It was in Afghanistan that virtually all the major figures in the new jihadist world cut their teeth. They helped shape events there in the aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a period that saw the emergence of al-Qaeda as a vehicle for a wider global jihad, and Afghanistan provided a base for it.

By the time the Taliban took over in 1996, they were virtually in partnership with Osama Bin Laden and his men, and it was from there that al-Qaeda launched its fateful 9/11 attack in 2001.

The formative Afghan experience provided both the combat-hardened salafist jihadist leaders and the strategists who were to play an instrumental role in the emergence of the IS of today.

Most significant was the Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who more than anybody else ended up being the direct parent of IS in almost every way.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Abu Musab al-Zarqawi

A high-school dropout whose prison career began with a sentence for drug and sexual offences, Zarqawi found religion after being sent to classes at a mosque in the Jordanian capital, Amman. He arrived in Pakistan to join jihad in Afghanistan just in time to see the Soviets withdraw in 1989, but stayed on to work with jihadists.

After a stint back in Jordan where he received a 15-year jail sentence on terrorist charges but was later released in a general amnesty, Zarqawi finally met Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in 1999. By all accounts the two al-Qaeda leaders did not take to him. They found him brash and headstrong, and they did not like the many tattoos from his previous life that he had not been able to erase.

But he was charismatic and dynamic, and although he did not join al-Qaeda, they eventually put him in charge of a training camp in Herat, western Afghanistan. It was here that he worked with an ideologue whose radical writings became the scriptures governing subsequent salafist blood-letting: Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir.

""The brutality of beheading is intended, even delightful to God and His Prophet,"" wrote Muhajir in his book The Theology of Jihad, more generally referred to as the Theology of Bloodshed. His writings provided religious cover for the most brutal excesses, and also for the killing of Shia as infidels, and their Sunni collaborators as apostates.

The other book that has been seen as the virtual manual - even the Mein Kampf - for IS and its forebears is The Management of Savagery, by Abu Bakr Naji, which appeared on the internet in 2004.

Image copyright Creative commons Image caption The Management of Savagery, a virtual manual for jihadists

""We need to massacre and to do just as has been done to Banu Qurayza, so we must adopt a ruthless policy in which hostages are brutally and graphically murdered unless our demands are met,"" Naji wrote. He was referring to a Jewish tribe in seventh-century Arabia which reportedly met the same fate at the hands of early Muslims as the Yazidis of Sinjar did nearly 14 centuries later: the men were slaughtered, the women and children enslaved.

Naji's sanctioning of exemplary brutality was part of a much wider strategy to prepare the way for an Islamic caliphate. Based partly on the lessons of Afghanistan, his book is a detailed blueprint for provoking the west into interventions which would further rally the Muslims to jihad, leading to the ultimate collapse of the enemy.

The scenario is not so fanciful if you consider that the Soviet Union went to pieces barely two years after its withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Naji is reported to have been killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan's Waziristan province in 2008.

Iraq fiasco

The fallout from the 9/11 attacks changed things radically for the jihadists in late 2001. The US and allies bombed and invaded Afghanistan, ousting the Taliban, and launching a wider ""War on Terror"" against al-Qaeda.

Bin Laden went underground, and Zarqawi and others fled. The dispersing militants, fired up, badly needed another battlefield on which to provoke and confront their Western enemies.

Luck was on their side. The Americans and their allies were not long in providing it.

Their invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 was, it turned out, entirely unjustified on its own chosen grounds - Saddam Hussein's alleged production of weapons of mass destruction, and his supposed support for international terrorists, neither of which was true.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bombardment of Baghdad before the US-led invasion in 2003

By breaking up every state and security structure and sending thousands of disgruntled Sunni soldiers and officials home, they created precisely the state of ""savagery"", or violent chaos, that Abu Bakr Naji envisaged for the jihadists to thrive in.

Iraq was on the way to becoming what US officials are now calling the ""parent tumour"" of the IS presence in the region.

Under Saddam's tightly-controlled Baath Party regime, the Sunnis enjoyed pride of place over the majority Shia, who have strong ties with their co-religionists across the border in Iran.

The US-led intervention disempowered the Sunnis, creating massive resentment and providing fertile ground for the outside salafist jihadists to take root in.

They were not long in spotting their constituency. Abu Musab Zarqawi moved in, and within a matter of months was organising deadly, brutal and provocative attacks aimed both at Western targets and at the majority Shia community.

Doctrinal differences between the two sects go back to disputes over the succession to the Prophet Muhammad in the early decades of Islam, but conflict between them is generally based on community, history and sectarian politics rather than religion as such.

Setting himself up with a new group called Tawhid wa al-Jihad (Tawhid means declaring the uniqueness of Allah), Zarqawi immediately forged a pragmatic operational alliance with underground cells of the remnants of Saddam's regime, providing the two main intertwined strands of the Sunni-based insurgency: militant Jihadism, and Iraqi Sunni nationalism.

His group claimed responsibility for several deadly attacks in August 2003 that set the pattern for much of what was to come: a suicide truck bomb explosion at the UN headquarters in Baghdad that killed the envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and 20 of his staff, and a suicide car bomb blast in Najaf which killed the influential Shia ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim and 80 of his followers. The bombers were salafist jihadists, but logistics were reportedly provided by underground Baathists.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Zarqawi was behind the deadly 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad

The following year, Zarqawi himself was believed by the CIA to be the masked killer shown in a video beheading an American hostage, Nicholas Berg, in revenge for the Abu Ghraib prison abuses of Iraqi detainees by members of the US military.

As the battle with the Americans and the new Shia-dominated Iraqi government intensified, Zarqawi finally took the oath of loyalty to Bin Laden, and his group became the official al-Qaeda branch in Iraq.

But they were never really on the same page. Zarqawi's provocative attacks on Shia mosques and markets, triggering sectarian carnage, and his penchant for publicising graphic brutality, were all in line with the radical teachings he had imbibed. But they drew rebukes from the al-Qaeda leadership, concerned at the impact on Muslim opinion.

Zarqawi paid little heed. His strain of harsh radicalism passed to his successors after he was killed by a US air strike in June 2006 on his hideout north of Baghdad. He was easily identified by the tattoos he had never managed to get rid of.

The direct predecessor of IS emerged just a few months later, with the announcement of the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) as an umbrella bringing the al-Qaeda branch together with other insurgent factions.

But tough times lay ahead. In January 2007, the Americans began ""surging"" their own troops in Iraq from 132,000 to a peak of 168,000, adopting a much more hands-on approach in mentoring the rebuilt Iraqi army. At the same time, they enticed Sunni tribes in western al-Anbar province to stop supporting the jihadists and join the US-led Coalition-Iraqi government drive to quell the insurgency, which many did, on promises that they would be given jobs and control over their own security.

By the time both the new ISI and al-Qaeda leaders were killed in a US-Iraqi army raid on their hideout in April 2010, the insurgency was at its lowest ebb, pushed back into remote corners of Sunni Iraq.

They were both replaced by one man, about whom very little was publicly known at the time, and not much more since: Ibrahim Awad al-Badri, better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Six eventful years later, he would be proclaimed Caliph Ibrahim, Commander of the Faithful and leader of the newly declared ""Islamic State"".

Territorial takeover

Baghdadi's career is so shrouded in mist that there are very few elements of it that can be regarded as fact. By all accounts he was born near Samarra, north of Baghdad, so the epithet ""Baghdadi"" seems to have been adopted to give him a more national image, while ""Abu Bakr"" evokes the first successor to (and father-in-law of) Prophet Muhammad.

Like the original Abu Bakr, Baghdadi is also reputed to come from the Prophet's Quraysh clan. That, and his youth - born in 1971 - may have been factors in his selection as leader.

All accounts of his early life agree that he was a quiet, scholarly and devout student of Islam, taking a doctorate at the Islamic University of Baghdad. Some even say he was shy, and a bit of a loner, living for 10 years in a room beside a small Sunni mosque in western Baghdad.

The word ""charismatic"" has never been attached to him.

Who is the leader of IS?

Image caption 29 June 2014: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi makes a rare appearance in public

As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law. His family nicknamed him The Believer because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards.

Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?

But by the time of the US-led invasion in 2003, he appears to have become involved with a militant Sunni group, heading its sharia (Islamic law) committee. American troops detained him, and he was reportedly held in the detention centre at Camp Bucca in the south for most of 2004.

Camp Bucca (named after a fireman who died in the 9/11 attacks) housed up to 20,000 inmates and became a university from which many IS and other militant leaders graduated. It gave them an unrivalled opportunity to imbibe and spread radical ideologies and sabotage skills and develop important contacts and networks, all in complete safety, under the noses and protection of their enemies.

Baghdadi would also certainly have met in Camp Bucca many of the ex-Baathist military commanders with whom he was to form such a deadly partnership.

The low-profile, self-effacing Baghdadi rang no alarm bells with the Americans. They released him, having decided he was low-risk.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Camp Bucca, 2008: A ""university"" for future IS leaders

But he went on to work his way steadily up through the insurgent hierarchy, virtually unknown to the Iraqi public.

By the time Baghdadi took over in 2010, the curtains seemed to be coming down for the jihadists in the Iraqi field of ""savagery"".

But another one miraculously opened up for them across the border in neighbouring Syria at just the right moment. In the spring of 2011, the outbreak of civil war there offered a promising new arena of struggle and expansion. The majority Sunnis were in revolt against the oppressive regime of Bashar al-Assad, dominated by his Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam.

Baghdadi sent his men in. By December 2011, deadly car bombs were exploding in Damascus which turned out to be the work of the then shadowy al-Nusra Front. It announced itself as an al-Qaeda affiliate the following month. It was headed by a Syrian jihadist, Abu Mohammed al-Julani. He had been sent by Baghdadi, but had his own ideas.

Jostling with a huge array of competing rebel groups in Syria, al-Nusra won considerable support on the ground because of its fearless and effective fighting skills, and the flow of funds and foreign fighters that support from al-Qaeda stimulated. It was relatively moderate in its salafist approach, and cultivated local relationships.

Al-Nusra was slipping out of Baghdadi's control, and he didn't like it. In April 2013, he tried to rein it back, announcing that al-Nusra was under his command in a new Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (Syria or the Levant). Isis, or Isil, was born.

What's in a name?

Image copyright Alamy Image caption IS flag: Arabic text of the first part of ""shahada"", the basic statement of the Islamic faith, and the seal of the Prophet below it

During the short and turbulent period over which it has imposed itself as a major news brand, so-called Islamic State has confused the world with a series of name changes reflecting its mutations and changing aspirations, leaving a situation where there is no universal agreement on how to refer to it.

After emerging in Iraq as the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), its spread to Syria prompted the addition of ""and al-Sham"", a word that can mean Damascus, Syria, or the wider Levant

Many chose to use the easy acronym Isis, with the ""S"" standing either for Syria or al-Sham, though the US administration and others opted for Isil (the ""l"" standing for ""Levant""). Both are still widely used though technically outdated

In Arabic the same acronym can come out as Daash, sometimes spelled Daesh in English; it has passed into common usage among many Arabs, but is disliked by the organisation itself, which sees it as disrespectful of the ""state""; although Daash has no meaning in Arabic, it also has an unpleasant sound to it, which may be why American and Western officialdom often use it

After further expansion of territory and ambitions, the movement dropped geographical specificity and called itself simply ""the Islamic State""; Much of the world was politically reluctant simply to call it that, for fear of implying legitimacy

The BBC and others have generally opted for calling it the ""self-styled"" or ""so-called"" Islamic State on first reference, and IS thereafter

But Julani rebelled, and renewed his oath of loyalty to al-Qaeda's global leadership, now under Ayman al-Zawahiri following Bin Laden's death in 2011. Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to go back to being just the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) and leave al-Nusra as the al-Qaeda Syria franchise.

It was Baghdadi's turn to ignore orders from head office.

Before 2013 was out, Isis and al-Nusra were at each other's throats. Hundreds were killed in vicious internecine clashes which ended with Isis being driven out of most of north-west Syria by al-Nusra and allied Syrian rebel factions. But Isis took over Raqqa, a provincial capital in the north-east, and made it its capital. Many of the foreign jihadists who had joined al-Nusra also went over to Isis, seeing it as tougher and more radical. In early 2014, al-Qaeda formally disowned Isis.

Isis had shaken off the parental shackles. But it had lost a lot of ground, and was bottled up. One of its main slogans, Remaining and Expanding, risked becoming empty. So where next?

Fortune smiled once more. Back in Iraq, conditions had again become ripe for the jihadists. The Americans had gone, since the end of 2011. Sunni areas were again aflame and in revolt, enraged by the sectarian policies of the Shia Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki. Sunnis felt marginalised, oppressed and angry.

Image copyright Alamy Image caption An IS fighter waves a flag while standing on a captured government fighter jet in Raqqa, Syria, 2015

When Isis decided to move, it was pushing at an open door. In fact, it had never really left Iraq, just gone into the woodwork. As it swept through Sunni towns, cities and villages with bewildering speed in June 2014, sleeper cells of salafist jihadists and ex-Saddamist militants and other sympathisers broke cover and joined the takeover.

With the capture of Mosul, Isis morphed swiftly into a new mode of being, like a rocket jettisoning its carrier. No longer just a shadowy terrorist group, it was suddenly a jihadist army not only threatening the Iraqi state, but challenging the entire world.

The change was signalled on 29 June by the proclamation of the ""Islamic State"", replacing all previous incarnations, and the establishment of the ""caliphate"". A few days later, the newly anointed Caliph Ibrahim, aka Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made a surprise appearance in Mosul in the pulpit of the historic Grand Mosque of Nour al-Din al-Zangi, heavily laden with anti-Crusader associations. He called on the world's Muslims to rally behind him.

By declaring a caliphate and adopting the generic ""Islamic State"" title, the organisation was clearly setting its sights far beyond Syria and Iraq. It was going global.

Announcing a caliphate has huge significance and resonance within Islam. While it remains the ideal, Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders had always shied away from it, for fear of failure. Now Baghdadi was trumping the parent organisation, setting IS up in direct competition with it for the leadership of global jihadism.

A caliphate (khilafa) is the rule or rein of a caliph (khalifa), a word which simply means a successor - primarily of the Prophet Muhammad. Under the first four caliphs who followed after he died in 632, the Islamic Caliphate burst out of Arabia and extended through modern-day Iran to the east, into Libya to the west, and to the Caucasus in the north.

The Umayyad caliphate which followed, based in Damascus, took over almost all of the lands that IS would like to control, including Spain. The Baghdad-based Abbasid caliphate took over in 750 and saw a flowering of science and culture, but found it hard to hold it all together, and Baghdad was sacked by the Mongols in 1258.

Emerging from that, the Ottoman Empire, based in Constantinople (Istanbul), stretched almost to Vienna at its peak, and was also a caliphate, though the distinction with empire was often blurred. The caliphate was finally abolished by Ataturk in 1924.

So when Baghdadi was declared Caliph of the Islamic State, it was an act of extraordinary ambition. He was claiming no less than the mantle of the Prophet, and of his followers who carried Islam into vast new realms of conquest and expansion.

For most Islamic scholars and authorities, not to mention Arab and Muslim leaders, such claims from the chief of one violent extremist faction had no legitimacy at all, and there was no great rush to embrace the new caliphate. But the millennial echoes it evoked did strike a chord with some Islamic romantics - and with some like-minded radical groups abroad.

Four months after the proclamation, a group of militants in Libya became the first to join up by pledging allegiance to Baghdadi, followed a month later by the Ansar Beit al-Maqdis jihadist faction in Egypt's Sinai. IS's tentacles spread deeper into Africa in March 2015 when Boko Haram in Nigeria took the oath of loyalty. Within a year, IS had branches or affiliates in 11 countries, though it held territory in only five, including Iraq and Syria.

It was in those two core countries that Baghdadi and his followers started implementing their state project on the ground, applying their own harsh vision of Islamic rule.

To the outside world, deprived of direct access to the areas controlled by IS, one of the most obvious and shocking aspects of this was their systematic destruction of ancient cultural and archaeological heritage sites and artefacts.

Some of the region's best-known and most-visited sites were devastated, including the magnificent temples of Bel and Baalshamin at Palmyra in Syria, and the Assyrian cities of Hatra and Nimrud in Iraq.

It wasn't just famous archaeological sites that came under attack. Christian churches and ancient monasteries, Shia mosques and shrines, and anything depicting figures of any sort were destroyed, and embellishments removed even from Sunni mosques. Barely a month after taking over Mosul, IS demolition squads levelled the 13th Century shrine of the Imam Awn al-Din, which had survived the Mongol invasion.

All of this was absolutely in line with IS's puritanical vision of Islam, under which any pictorial representation or shrine is revering something other than Allah, and any non-Muslim structures are monuments of idolatry. Even Saudi kings and princes to this day are buried without coffins in unmarked graves.

Image copyright AFP Image caption A video posted to YouTube in 2015 showed destruction of sculpted faces at Hatra

By posting videos of many of these acts which the rest of the world saw as criminal cultural vandalism, IS also undoubtedly intended to shock. In that sense, it was the cultural equivalent of beheading aid workers.

And there was a more practical and profitable side to the onslaught on cultural heritage. In highly organised manner, IS's Treasury Department issues printed permits to loot archaeological sites, and takes a percentage of the proceeds.

That is just the tip of the iceberg of a complex structure of governance and control put in place as IS gradually settled in to its conquests, penetrating into every aspect of people's lives in exactly the same way as Saddam Hussein's intelligence apparatus had done.

Captured documents published by Der Spiegel last year give some idea of the role of ex-Baathist regime men in setting up and running IS in a highly structured and organised way, with much emphasis on intelligence and security.

Media caption How is Islamic State run?

Residents of Sunni strongholds like Mosul and Falluja in Iraq, and Raqqa in Syria, found that IS operatives already knew almost everything about everybody when they moved in and took over in 2014.

At checkpoints, ID cards were checked against databases on laptops, obtained from government ration or employee registers. Former members of the security forces had to go to specific mosques to ""repent"", hand over their weapons and receive a discharge paper.

""At first, all they did was change the preachers in the mosques to people with their own views,"" said a Mosul resident who fled a year later.

""But then they began to crack down. Women who had been able to go bare-headed now had to cover up, first with the headscarf and then with the full face-veil. Men have to grow beards and wear short-legged trousers. Cigarettes, hubble-bubble, music and cafes were banned, then satellite TV and mobile phones. Morals police [hisba] vehicles would cruise round, looking for offenders.""

Media caption Citizen journalists from Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS) describe life in the IS-controlled city

A Falluja resident recounted the story of a taxi-driver who had picked up a middle-aged woman not wearing a headscarf. They were stopped at an IS checkpoint, the woman given a veil and allowed to go, while the driver was sent to an Islamic court, and sentenced to two months' detention and to memorise a portion of the Koran. If you fail to memorise, the sentence is repeated.

""They have courts with judges, officials, records and files, and there are fixed penalties for each crime, it's not random,"" said the Falluja resident. ""Adulterers are stoned to death. Thieves have their hands cut off. Gays are executed by being thrown off high buildings. Informers are shot dead, Shia militia prisoners are beheaded.""

Severed heads on park fences: A diary of life under IS

An activist based in Raqqa from a group called Al-Sharqiya 24 has been keeping a diary of what life is like under Islamic State group rule.

Life under ""Islamic State"": Diaries

There are IS departments that carry the organisation's grip into every corner of life, including finance, agriculture, education, transport, health, welfare and utilities.

School curricula were overhauled in line with IS precepts, with history rewritten, all images being removed from schoolbooks and English taken off the menu.

""One thing you can say is this,"" said the Mosul resident. ""There is absolutely no corruption, no wasta (knowing the right people and pulling strings). They are totally convinced they are on the right track.""

Image caption Map, purportedly produced by IS, showing group's aspirational takeover of all lands historically controlled by caliphates and Ottoman Empire

One recent story tells a lot about IS and its ways.

As Iraqi security forces were pressing forward in areas around Ramadi earlier this year, civilians were fleeing the battle - and IS fighters, losing the day, were trying to sneak out too.

Two women, running from the combat zone, approached a police checkpoint.

As they were being waved through to safety, one of the women suddenly turned to the police, pointed at the other, and said : ""This is not a woman. He's an IS emir [commander].""

The police investigated, and it was true. The other woman was a man, who had shaved, and put on makeup and women's clothes. He turned out to be top of the list of wanted local IS commanders.

""When IS arrived, he killed my husband, who was a policeman, raped me, and then took me as his wife,"" the woman told the police.

""I put up with him all this time, waiting to avenge my husband and my honour,"" she said. ""I tricked him into shaving and putting on makeup, then denounced him to the police.""

What is life like for women under IS?

Media caption Nour is a woman from Raqqa, the so-called Islamic State's capital inside Syria

""Nour"" is a woman from Raqqa, the so-called Islamic State's (IS) capital inside Syria. She managed to escape the city and is now a refugee in Europe, where she met up with the BBC.

This story is based on her experiences and those of her two sisters, who are still inside the IS-held city.

Taking on the world

Having taken over vast swathes of territory in Iraq with their lightning offensive in June 2014, the militants might have been expected to calm down and consolidate their gains.

But, like a shark that has to keep moving or else it will die, IS barely paused before initiating a new spiral of provocation and reprisals that was predictably to draw it into active conflict with almost all the major world powers.

Already, the June offensive had threatened the approaches to Baghdad, prompting the Americans to start bringing in hundreds of military advisers and trainers to see how to help the struggling Iraqi army.

Just two months later, the attack on Kurdish areas in the north triggered US air strikes in defence of the Kurdistan capital, Irbil, and then to help stave off the threat of genocide to the Yazidis. Fourteen other nations were to join the air campaign.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters head to the Mosul dam (August, 2014 )

Ten days later, IS beheaded James Foley and the others followed, in line with the doctrine of exemplary brutality as punishment, deterrent and provocation. The most shocking was to come some months later, with the burning alive of the downed Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh. Shock intended.

The US-led bombing campaign was extended to Syria in September 2014 after IS besieged the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the Turkish border. Coalition air strikes turned the tide there. IS lost hundreds of fighters killed at Kobane and elsewhere. More revenge was called for. IS turned abroad.

From the declaration of the caliphate until early 2016, some 70 terrorist attacks were either carried out or inspired by IS in 20 countries around the globe, from California to Sydney, with an estimated 1,200 victims killed. The attacks carried the same message of punishment, deterrence and provocation as the hostage beheadings, while also demonstrating IS's global reach.

At the same time, they carried through the militants' doctrine of distracting the enemy by setting fires in different locations and making him squander resources on security. For IS, ""the enemy"" is everybody who does not embrace it. The world is divided into Dawlat al-Islam, the State of Islam, and Dawlat al-Kufr, the State of Unbelief.

The most consequential of these atrocities were the downing of a Russian airliner over Sinai on 31 October and the Paris attacks on 13 November, provoking both Russia and France to intensify air strikes on IS targets in Syria.

Had IS gone mad? It seemed determined to take on the whole world. It was goading and confronting the Americans, the Russians, and a long list of others. By its own count, it had a mere 40,000 fighters at its command (other estimates go as low as half that).

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A memorial to the victims of downed Airbus A321, at Pulkovo Airport in Russia, in November 2015

Could it really challenge the global powers and hope to survive? Or can President Barack Obama fulfil his pledge to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" IS?

Final showdown

If there seems to be something apocalyptic about IS's ""bring it on"" defiance, that's because there is.

When the organisation first brought out its online magazine - a major showcase and recruitment tool - just a month after the ""caliphate"" was declared, it was not by chance that it was named Dabiq.

A small town north of Aleppo in Syria, Dabiq is mentioned in a hadith (a reported saying of the Prophet Muhammad) in connection with Armageddon. In IS mythology, it is the scene where a cataclysmic showdown will take place between the Muslims and the infidels, leading to the end of days. Each issue of Dabiq begins with a quote from Abu Musab Zarqawi: ""The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify - by Allah's permission - until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq.""

Image caption Dabiq - Islamic State's online magazine

The prospect of taking part in that final glorious climax, achieving martyrdom on the path of Allah and an assured place in paradise, is one of the thoughts inspiring those heeding the IS call to jihad.

That could help explain why the organisation seems to enjoy an endless supply of recruits willing to blow themselves to pieces in suicide attacks, which it calls ""martyrdom-seeking operations"" (suicide is forbidden in Islam). Hundreds have died in this way, and they happen virtually daily.

It's one of the elements that makes IS a formidable fighting force that will be hard to destroy even in strictly military terms.

The Baathist legacy at the core of IS

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Former Iraqi army officers have helped organise and direct IS

IS is in many respects a project of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath party, but now with a different ideology. Former agents or officers of Saddam Hussein's regime dominate its leadership... They represent a battle-hardened and state-educated core that would likely endure (as they have done through US occupation and a decade of war) even if the organisation's middle and lower cadres are decimated.

Is Islamic State invincible?

The head of security and intelligence for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, Masrour Barzani, tells the story of a frustrated would-be suicide bomber who screamed at his captors: ""I was just ten minutes away from being united with the Prophet Muhammad!""

""They think they're winners regardless of whether they kill you or they get killed,"" says Barzani. ""If they kill you, they win a battle. If they get killed, they go to heaven. With people like this, it's very difficult to deter them from coming at you. So really the only way to defeat them is to eliminate them.""

Probably for the first time in military history since the Japanese kamikaze squadrons of World War Two, suicide bombers are used by IS not only for occasional terrorist spectaculars, but as a standard and common battlefield tactic.

Virtually all IS attacks begin with one or several suicide bombers driving explosives-rigged cars or trucks at the target, softening it up for combat squads to go in. So much so that the ""martyrdom-seekers"" have been called the organisation's ""air force"", since they serve a similar purpose.

Formidable though that is, IS as a fighting force is much more than a bunch of wild-eyed fanatics eager to blow themselves up. For that, they have Saddam Hussein to thank.

""The core of IS are former Saddam-era army and intelligence officers, particularly from the Republican Guard,"" said an international intelligence official. ""They are very good at moving their people around, resupply and so on, they're actually much more effective and efficient than the Iraqi army are. That's the hand of former military staff officers who know their business.""

""They are very professional,"" adds Masrour Barzani. ""They use artillery, armoured vehicles, heavy machinery etc, and they are using it very well. They have officers who know conventional war and how to plan, how to attack, how to defend. They really are operating on the level of a very organised conventional force. Otherwise they'd be no more than a terrorist organisation.""

The partnership with the ex-Baathists, going back to Zarqawi's early days in Iraq, is clearly a vital component in IS success.

But that does not mean its fighters are invincible on the battlefield. The Kurds in north-east Syria were fighting IS off with no outside help for a year before anybody noticed. And even now, IS makes what would conventionally be seen as costly mistakes.

In December 2015, they lost several hundred fighters in one abortive attack east of Mosul alone, and probably 2,500 altogether that month. In total some 15,000 are estimated to have been killed by Coalition air strikes since August 2014.

But they seem to have little difficulty making up the numbers. With a population of perhaps 10 million acquiescent Sunnis to draw on in Iraq and Syria, most recruiting is done locally. And if IS remains in place, there will soon be a new generation of young militants.

Media caption IS' brainwashing of children

""I didn't join out of conviction,"" says Bakr Madloul, a 24-year-old bachelor who was arrested in December at his home in a Sunni quarter in southern Baghdad and accused of taking part in deadly IS car bomb attacks on mainly Shia areas, which he admits.

Bakr says he was working as a construction foreman in Kurdistan when IS took over Mosul. He was detained for questioning by Kurdish security, and met a militant in jail who persuaded him to go to Mosul, where he joined up with IS and manned a checkpoint until it was hit by a Coalition air strike.

He was then sent back to his Baghdad suburb to help organise car bombings. The explosives-packed vehicles were sent from outside Baghdad, and his job was to place them where he was told by his controller, usually in crowded streets or markets.

Image caption Bakr Madloul (left) pictured during his time as an IS operative

""Only one of the five car bombs I handled was driven by a suicide bomber,"" he says. ""I spoke to him. He was 22 years old, an Iraqi. He believed he would go to paradise when he died. It's the easiest and quickest way to Heaven. They strongly believe this. They would blow themselves up to get to Heaven. There were older ones in their 30s and 40s.""

""I asked my controllers more than once, 'Is it OK to kill women and children?' They would answer, 'They're all the same.' But to me, killing women and children, I didn't feel at all comfortable about that. But once you're in, you're stuck. If you try to leave, they call you a murtadd, an apostate, and they'll kill you or your family.""

Bakr knows he will almost certainly hang. I asked him if he would do the same things over if he had his life again. He laughed.

""Absolutely not. I would get out of Iraq, away from IS, away from the security forces. I took this path without realising the consequences. There is no way back. I see that now.""

Image caption Bakr Madloul knows he will probably be executed

But up in Kurdistan, another IS prisoner, Muhannad Ibrahim, has no such regrets.

A 32-year-old from a village near Mosul with a wife and three children, he was a construction worker for a Turkish company when IS took over the city. Two of his older brothers had died fighting the Americans there in 2004 and 2006. He joined IS without hesitation and was commanding a small detachment when he was captured in a battle with the Kurds.

""We were being oppressed by the Shia, they were always insulting and bothering us,"" he says. ""But that's not the main motivation, religious conviction is more important. All my family is religious, praise be to Allah. I came to IS through my faith and religious principles.""

""If I had my time over again, I would take the same path, the same choices. Because I am convinced by this thing, I have to go to the end. Either I am killed, or Allah will decree some other fate for me.""

Image caption Captured IS fighter Muhannad Ibrahim is unrepentant

Taming Mosul

Defeating IS militarily is less about its own strengths and vulnerabilities than it is about the deficiencies of the forces arrayed against it. IS is as strong as the weaknesses of the failed states whose collapse into ""savagery"" has left room for it to take root and grow.

Iraq and Syria have to be the primary focus, as the commander of Coalition forces, Lt Gen Sean MacFarland, spelled out in February 2016:

""The campaign has three objectives: one, to destroy the Isil parent tumour in Iraq and Syria by collapsing its power centres in Mosul and Raqqa; two, to combat the emerging metastasis of the Isil tumour worldwide; and three, to protect our nations from attack.""

It goes without saying that Coalition air strikes, deadly and effective as they are, have their limitations. Only in co-ordination with cohesive, motivated ground forces can the territory taken by IS be regained. And that's the crippling problem, in both countries.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A Kurdish fighter passes IS graffiti in the town of Sinjar

The Kurds in the north of both Iraq and Syria have made considerable progress in pushing IS back from areas they regard as theirs, with the help of air strikes. But they are neither capable of going all the way, nor should they - in both countries, they would stir up acute communal sensitivities in the Sunni Arab areas where IS is rooted.

Pro-government forces in Iraq have largely dislodged IS from Diyala province and the Tikrit area north of the capital, but that was mainly the work of Iranian-backed Shia militias who leapt to the defence of Baghdad and the south as IS advanced southwards in June 2014 after the army collapsed.

Using them in mainly Sunni areas is fraught with risk.

Ramadi, the provincial capital of al-Anbar to the west, was recaptured at the end of 2015 in an offensive spearheaded by the government's US-built Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS), with the Shia militias kept out of this Sunni stronghold. But the CTS has limited numbers and has been badly battered. And Ramadi was left in ruins, its entire population fled.

Image copyright AFP Image caption February 2016: Iraqi forces on the outskirts of Ramadi

All of which does not augur well for the sound retrieval of remaining Sunni hotbeds where IS is dug in in Iraq, such as Falluja - barely 30 miles from Baghdad - and above all, Mosul, 10 times the size of Ramadi.

Surprisingly, given the presence of literally hundreds of competing rebel factions, it's in Syria that the chances of making serious progress against IS may be greater, though still not great.

The IS imperative has spurred all the outside parties involved there, including the Americans and the Russians and their regional and local allies, for the first time to put serious weight behind a truce and a negotiated settlement between rebels and regime.

The idea and driving motive is that all parties would then be free to turn on IS, and, to be consistent, also al-Nusra Front, because it belongs to al-Qaeda. It may seem like a long shot, but the US seems to be pushing very hard indeed, making things happen that have resisted for nearly five years.

If all the parties - the rebel groups, the Kurds, regime troops and militias, and their outside allies including the Coalition and the Russians - can somehow be reconciled and turned against IS, its chances of surviving for long in Syria would not be great.

Its only real conurbation there is Raqqa. It is much less deeply embedded in the Sunni population in Syria than in Iraq. Disgruntled Syrian Sunnis have many other vehicles for pressing their grievances against the regime.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Iraqi army is preparing for operations to re-take the city of Mosul

So it keeps coming back again to Iraq, and specifically, to Mosul. Ten times the size of Raqqa. And that's not the only reason for its significance.

""Mosul is the beating heart of IS,"" says a senior western official in northern Iraq. ""IS is essentially an Iraqi creation. The tragic reality is that at the moment, it is the main Sunni political entity in Iraq. From the West, it's looked at as a kind of crazed cult. It's not. Here in Iraq it represents an important constituency. It represents a massive dissatisfaction, the alienation of a whole sector of the population.""

""That's not to say that the people in Mosul are enthusiastic about IS, but for them, it's better than anything that comes from Baghdad.""

The word in both Baghdad and northern Iraq is that the Americans are pushing seriously hard for a Mosul campaign by the end of 2016, with President Obama's departure in mind. That may not be possible, given the difficulties involved in assembling credible ground forces, as well as severe financial crises affecting both Baghdad and Kurdistan.

Image copyright EPA Image caption The Al-Noori Al-Kabeer mosque in Mosul

But if it does go ahead, the fear is that wrongly-conceived short-term victory, if it is achieved, will turn into long-term disaster, given the total lack of national reconciliation between Sunnis and Shia in the wake of the sectarian carnage that followed Saddam's overthrow in 2003.

Sunni grievances in Iraq are such that if IS did not exist, it would have to be invented. Without reconciliation and a sense of Sunni empowerment and partnership in a national project, IS in some shape or form will always be there, just as the Taliban are now resurgent in Afghanistan despite everything that was done to oust them.

But the Iraqi expert on radical movements, Hisham al-Hashemi, believes that IS could be badly damaged if the Coalition succeed in one of their top-priority tasks - to kill Abu Bakr Baghdadi.

Leaders have been killed before, and replaced with little obvious effect on the course of history. But Hashemi believes Baghdadi is different.

""IS' future depends on Baghdadi,"" he says. ""If he is killed, it will split up. One part would stay on his track and announce a new caliphate. Another would split off and return to al-Qaeda. Others would turn into gangs following whoever is strongest.""

""The source of his strength is that he brought about an ideological transformation, blending jihadist ideas with Baathist intelligence security methods, enabling him to create this quasi-state organisation.""

Hashemi believes only Baghdadi can hold it together. There have been numerous false reports of him being hit, but he appears to be stubbornly and elusively still alive, not seen in public since that mosque appearance in early July 2014.

The Americans are unlikely to rest until they have killed Baghdadi, not least because of their belief that he personally repeatedly raped an American NGO worker, Kayla Mueller, and then had her killed in early 2015.

But even if they do get him, and even if IS does break up, the Sunni problem in Iraq will not go away.

Capitalising on chaos

IS is in any case spreading its bets and developing other territorial options. At present, Libya looks the most promising. It has just the kind of failed-state anarchy, the ""savagery"", that leaves room for the jihadists to move in, forging alliances with local militants and disgruntled supporters of the overthrown regime. Just like Iraq.

IS signalled its arrival there in typical style, issuing a polished video in February 2015 showing a group of 21 bewildered Egyptian Christian workers in orange jumpsuits being beheaded on a Libyan beach, their blood mingling with the waters of the Mediterranean as a warning to the ""crusader"" European countries on the other side.

The man who voiced that warning was believed to be the IS leader in Libya, an Iraqi called Wissam al-Zubaydi, aka Abu Nabil. By coincidence, Zubaydi was killed in a US air strike on the same day IS struck terror in Paris, 13 November 2015.

The man sent by IS to replace him, Abu Omar al-Janabi, was another Iraqi and former Baathist with a tough reputation and a knack for generating revenue - clearly with one eye on Libya's oil facilities, given the damage wrought by Coalition bombing on the organisation's exploitation of fields in Iraq and Syria.

Image copyright AP Image caption An image from a video, posted online by Libyan IS supporters, showing ""Islamic police"" in the city of Sirte

The US and allies have been powerless to halt IS advances in Libya, taking over a big stretch of the coast around the central city of Sirte, which was to (overthrown) Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi what Tikrit was to Saddam Hussein. Another American air strike in February killed (among nearly 50 other people) Noureddine Chouchane, reputedly an IS figure responsible for the deadly attacks on Western tourists in his native Tunisia next door.

With little prospect of a national unity government to end Libya's chaotic fragmentation and provide partners on the ground, such remote strikes - which sometimes act as powerful recruiters for the militants - are about all the frustrated Western powers can do as IS takes root and spreads.

There are other possibilities already beckoning - Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia... wherever there are dysfunctional states and angry Muslims, there are opportunities for IS, competing strongly with a diminished al-Qaeda as a dominant brand in the jihadist market. Adding the extra risk for the West, that that competition could be another spur for spectacular terrorist attacks which they know are being actively plotted.

Battle for minds

In the first 18 months after the declaration of the ""Islamic State"", the number of foreign fighters making their way to join jihad in Syria and Iraq rose dramatically. The New York-based security consultancy Soufan Group estimated that 27,000 foreign jihadists had made the trip from 86 countries, more than half of them from the Middle East and North Africa.

Clearly, the caliphate had appeal, despite - perhaps in some cases because of - its graphically publicised brutality. A tribute to its extraordinary skill in using the internet and social media as a propaganda and grooming tool.

Ten months after vowing to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the organisation, President Obama ruefully acknowledged that IS ""has been particularly effective at reaching out to and recruiting vulnerable people around the world including here in the United States, and they are targeting Muslim communities around the world"".

And he put his finger on the real challenge, monumentally greater than the comparatively simple task of defeating IS militarily:

""Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they are defeated by better ideas, a more attractive and more compelling vision,"" he said.

The complex art of IS propaganda

Image copyright IS image

On a relatively normal day... there was a total of 50 distinct pieces of propaganda. The photo reports and videos included depictions of an IS offensive in northern Syria and eulogies for the dead in Salahuddin... Overwhelmingly, though, the propagandists were preoccupied with a carefully refined view of 'normal' life.

Fishing and ultraviolence

The problem is that when disenchanted people in the region look around them - especially the young, the idealistic, or the hopeless unemployed who have no future - they see scant evidence of ""better ideas"" or attractive and compelling visions.

They see the ruins of an ""Arab Spring"" which raised hopes only to dash them cruelly.

The brutal, corrupt dictatorships which it shook have either fragmented into chaos and sectarian and tribal upheaval, like Syria itself, Libya, Yemen and (with Western intervention) Iraq, or the ""deep states"" of their former regimes came back, even more harshly in the case of Egypt, more gently in the case of Tunisia.

While many of the European jihadists may have heeded the call for other reasons, socio-economic factors play an important part in radicalising some of the Arab jihadists, and will continue to do so unless addressed.

Why IS still attracts recruits from Europe

Image copyright West Midlands Police Image caption Tareena Shakil, who took her toddler son to Syria to join IS, was jailed after returning to the UK

The flow of recruits, both fighters and families, leaving their homes in Europe to live under so-called Islamic State rule in Raqqa in Syria has slowed dramatically.

""It reached its peak in 2013-14, when it was far easier for jihadists to cross the 822km-long (510-mile) Turkey-Syria border, when IS propaganda on social media went largely unchallenged, and when IS was on a roll militarily, seizing ever more territory across northern Syria and north-western Iraq.

""While all three of those factors have now changed to the detriment of IS, the underlying factors propelling young Britons and Europeans towards joining the group have not gone away. So what are they?

Islamic State: What is the attraction for young Europeans?

One of the biggest contingents is from Tunisia, where a detailed survey in the poorest suburbs of the capital showed clearly that the radicalisation of young people there had far less to do with extreme Islamic ideology as such than it did with unemployment, marginalisation and disillusion after a revolution into which they threw themselves, but which gave them nothing, and left them hopeless.

IS is also filling a desert left by the collapse of all the political ideologies that have stirred Arab idealists over the decades. Many used to travel to the Soviet Union for training and tertiary education, but communism is now seen as a busted flush. Arab socialism and Arab nationalism that caused such excitement in the 1950s and 1960s mutated into brutal, corrupt ""republics"" where sons were groomed to inherit power from their fathers.

In this vacuum, IS took up the cause of punishing the West and other outsiders for their actions in the region over the past century:

the carve-up by the colonial powers 100 years ago, drawing a border between Iraq and Syria which IS has now erased

the creation of Israel under the British mandate for Palestine, and its subsequent unswerving political and financial support by the US

Western (and indeed Russian) backing for corrupt and tyrannical Arab regimes

the Western invasion and destruction of Iraq on the flimsiest of pretexts, with the death of uncounted thousands of Iraqis

the Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo prisoner abuse scandals....

The roots of IS also lie in a crisis within Islam.

""Isil is not Islamic,"" said President Obama, echoing statements by many western leaders that ""IS has nothing to do with Islam"".

It has.

""It is based on Islamic texts that are reinterpreted according to how they see it,"" says Ahmad Moussalli, professor of politics at the American University of Beirut. ""I don't say they are not coming out of Islamic tradition, that would be denying facts. But their interpretation is unusual, literal sometimes, very much like the Wahhabis.""

Hisham al-Hashemi, the Iraqi expert on radical groups, agrees.

""Violent extremism in IS and the salafist jihadist groups is justified, indeed blessed, in Islamic law texts relied on by IS and the extremist groups. It's a crisis of religious discourse, not of a barbaric group. Breaking up the religious discourse and setting it on the right course is more important by far than suppressing the extremist groups militarily.""

Because ancient texts can be interpreted by extremists to cover their worst outrages does not implicate the entire religion, any more than Christianity is defined by the Inquisition, where burning at the stake was a stock penalty.

Extremist ideas remain in the dark, forgotten corners of history unless their time comes. And IS time came, with Afghanistan, Iraq, and everything that followed.

""Salafism is spreading in the world, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab countries,"" says Prof Moussalli.

He blames the Saudis for stifling the emergence of a moderate, democratic version of Islam, the ""alternative Islamic discourse"" to salafism that President Obama would like to see.

""A moderate Islamic narrative today is a Muslim Brotherhood narrative, which has been destroyed by the Gulf states supporting the military coup in Egypt,"" says Prof Moussalli, referring to the Egyptian military's ousting of the elected President Mohammed Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood figure, in July 2013.

""We lost that opportunity with Egypt. Egypt could have paved the way for real change in the area. But Saudi Arabia stood against it, in a very malicious way, and destroyed the possibility of changing the Arab regimes into more democratic regimes that accept the transfer of power peacefully. They don't want it.""

Saudi Arabia's ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment and its constant propagation have raised ambiguity over its relations with radical groups abroad. Enemies and critics have accused it of producing the virulent strain of Wahhabism that inspires the extremists, and even of supporting IS and other ultra-salafist groups.

But Jamal Khashoggi, a leading Saudi journalist and writer who spent time in Afghanistan and knew Bin Laden, says that simply is not true

""We are at war with IS, which sees us as corrupt Wahhabis."" he says.

""IS is a form of Wahhabism that has been suppressed here since the 1930s. It resurfaced with the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 and spread here and there. But Saudi Arabia didn't back it at all, it saw it as a threat. So it's true that salafism can turn radical, just as the US right-wing produces some crazy lunatics.""

Hundreds of people died in a two-week siege when extremist salafists took over the Grand Mosque, the holiest place in Islam, in protest at what they saw as the Kingdom's deviation from the true path.

More recently, Saudi Arabia's security forces and its Shia minority have in fact been the target of attacks by IS, and the kingdom has executed captured militants. It has an active deradicalisation programme.

But Mr Khashoggi agrees that the Saudis made a huge mistake when they backed the overthrow of the elected Muslim Brotherhood president in Egypt and the subsequent crackdown on the movement, which has pushed political Islam into the arms of the radicals.

""There were no pictures of Isis, Bin Laden or al-Qaeda in Tahrir Square,"" he says. ""It was an opportunity for democracy in the Middle East, but we made a historical blunder for which we are all paying now.""

But the Kingdom's extreme conservatism, its distaste for democracy, and its custodianship of the shrines in Mecca and Medina to which millions of Muslims make pilgrimage every year, have made it one of the main targets for calls for an unlikely reformation within Islam as part of the battle to defeat IS and other extremist groups.

""We must accept the fact that Islam has a crisis,"" says a senior Sunni politician in Iraq.

""IS is not a freak. Look at the roots, the people, the aims. If you don't deal with the roots, the situation will be much more dangerous. The world has to get rid of IS, but needs a new deal: reformation, in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, al-Azhar [the ancient seat of Sunni Islamic learning and authority in Cairo].""

""You can't kill all the Muslims, you need an Islamic reformation. But Saudi and Qatari money is blotting out the voices so we can't get anywhere. It's the curse of the Arab world, too much oil, too much money.""

Regional rivalry

IS is at the heart of yet another of the region's burning themes - the strategic geopolitical contest, the game of nations, that is taking place as Syria and Iraq disintegrate.

When the US-led coalition destroyed the Iraqi state in 2003, it was breaking down the wall that was containing Iran, the region's Shia superpower, seen as a threat by the Saudis and most of their Sunni Gulf partners since its Islamic revolution in 1979.

Iran had for years been backing anti-Saddam Iraqi Shia factions in exile. Through those groups, the empowerment of the majority Shia community in Iraq after 2003 gave Iran unrivalled influence over Iraqi politics.

The arrival of the IS threat led to even more Iranian penetration, arming, training and directing the Shia militia who rose in defence of Baghdad and the South.

""If it weren't for Iran, the democratic experiment in Iraq would have fallen,"" says Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Iranian-backed Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups.

""Obama was sleeping, and he didn't wake up until IS was at the gates of Erbil. When they were at the gates of Baghdad, he did nothing. Were it not for Iran's support, IS would have taken over the whole Gulf, not just Iraq.""

For Saudi Arabia and its allies, Iranian penetration in Iraq threatens to establish, indeed largely has, a Shia crescent, linking Iran, Iraq, Syria under its minority Alawite leadership, and Lebanon dominated by the Iranian-created Shia faction Hezbollah.

From the outset of the war in Syria, the Saudis and their Gulf partners, and Turkey, backed the Sunni rebels in the hope that the overthrow of Assad would establish Sunni majority rule.

So then a north-south Sunni axis running from Turkey through Syria to Jordan and Saudi Arabia would drive a stake through the heart of the Shia crescent and foil the Iranian project, as they saw it.

That is essentially what IS did in 2014 when it moved back into Iraq, took Mosul and virtually all the country's Sunni areas, and established a Sunni entity which straddled the suddenly irrelevant border with Syria, blocking off Shia parts of Iraq from Syria.

If IS had just stayed put at that point and dug in, who would have shifted them? Had they not gone on to attack the Kurds, the Americans would not have intervened. Had they not shot down a Russian airliner and attacked Paris, the Russians and French would not have stepped up their involvement.

""Had they not become international terrorists and stayed local terrorists, they could have served the original agenda of dividing the Arab east so there would be no Shia crescent,"" says Prof Moussalli.

We may never know why they did it. Perhaps their virulent strain of salafism just had to keep going: Remaining and Expanding.

Could they now just row back and settle in to their ""state"", stop antagonising people, and eventually gain acceptance, just as Iran has after its own turbulent revolution and international isolation?

It seems unlikely, for the same driving reasons that they made that escalation in the first place. And even if IS wanted to, the Americans also seem set on their course, and they have proven implacable in their pursuit of revenge for terrorist outrages.

But what is the alternative? Given the problem of assembling capable ground forces, can the Americans be complicit in a takeover of Mosul by Iranian-backed Shia militias, and of Raqqa by Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian regime forces or other non-Sunni groups like the Kurds? Is their hostility to IS so strong that they would watch the Iranians connect up their Shia crescent? And would the Saudis and Turks go along with that?

There are no easy answers to any of the challenges posed by IS in all the strands of crisis that it brings together.

That's why it's still there.

Dados divulgados pelo Forum Economico Mundial revelam que a equiparacao entre os sexos so deve ocorrer daqui a mais de 100 anos, em 2133. O Indice Global de Desigualdade de Genero de 2015 analisou 145 paises, entre eles o Brasil (85o lugar). Islandia (1o), Noruega (2o) e Finlandia (3o) lideram o ranking, com Siria (143o), Paquistao (144o) e Iemen (145o) nas ultimas posicoes.

Confira abaixo o desempenho de cada pais por igualdade de genero. As estatisticas sao baseadas em um relatorio do Forum Economico Mundial que comparou 145 paises segundo a probabilidade de as mulheres participarem da vida politica e economica bem como ter acesso a educacao e a saude.

Metodologia

Para produzir o Indice Global de Desigualdade de Genero, o Forum Economico Mundial analisou mais de uma dezena de dados relacionados a participacao economica e oportunidade, nivel de escolaridade, saude, sobrevivencia e capacitacao politica.

Os rankings foram compilados calculando a desigualdade de genero no acesso a recursos e oportunidades em cada pais. Essa base de comparacao permite analisar paises pobres e ricos de igual maneira.

Esta e a 10a edicao do relatorio e abrange 145 paises.

Os dados sobre a desigualdade de salarios entre homens e mulheres sao da Organizacao para Cooperacao Economica e Desenvolvimento (OCDE). As estatisticas usadas de cada pais eram as ultimas disponiveis - entre 2010 a 2013.

A OCDE calcula a diferenca salarial entre homens e mulheres como a diferenca entre os salarios medios de homens e mulheres em relacao ao salario medio dos homens. As estimativas sao baseadas em trabalhadores de tempo integral.

bbc.com,,The 20 best science images of the year?,"['Bbc News', 'Paul Kerley']","Image caption Raynaud's disease - Matthew Clavey, Thermal Vision Research

From multicoloured scans of parts of the human body to vivid photos of creatures up close, the finalists of the annual Wellcome Image Awards have been announced.

The thermal image above shows the temperature of two people's hands - a healthy person on the left, and someone with Raynaud's disease on the right.

Both hands were put in cold water for two minutes before being imaged. The healthy hand then warmed at a considerably faster rate.

""This image is striking because it shows so vividly the difference between normal circulation and the poor circulation of someone with Raynaud's disease - triggered by cold temperature, stress and anxiety,"" says head of Wellcome Images and chair of the judging panel, Catherine Draycott.

Scroll down to see the other 19 finalists.

Wiring the human brain

Alfred Anwander, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences

A kaleidoscope of colour reveals a map of pathways inside the brain of a young healthy adult.

Different parts of the brain communicate with each other through nerve fibres - which are colour-coded here.

Using a type of magnetic resonance imaging - or MRI - the image was created from mapping virtual slices of the brain, from top to bottom, tracking the direction and movement of water molecules.

""We felt it captured the essence of the technique whilst giving a picture of the living brain,"" says Catherine Draycott.

Black henna allergy

Nicola Kelley, Cardiff and Vale University Hospital NHS Trust

""Here you can see a black henna tattoo on the forearm of a young woman who has suffered an allergic reaction to the dye,"" explains Dirk Pilat, medical director for e-Learning at the Royal College of GPs, and a GP himself.

""It's beautifully lit and shows the translucence of the skin that's been raised in blisters, capturing the early stage of the reaction.""

Dye from the henna plant is commonly used to temporarily stain skin or hair orange-brown, but chemical dyes can be added to turn the colour black.

Human stem cell

Silvia A Ferreira, Cristina Lopo and Eileen Gentleman, King's College London

""This is a scanning electron micrograph of a stem cell taken from the bone marrow inside the hip bone of a healthy person,"" explains Robin Lovell-Badge, a Wellcome awards judge and head of stem cell biology and developmental genetics at the Francis Crick Institute.

""This really stood out, we found the natural symmetry alongside the very subtle colouring very striking. It's lovely and sharp.""

Stem cells can divide to make some of the other types of cells found in the body.

This one is about 15 micrometres (0.015mm) across - and before the image could be taken, it was first frozen at cryogenic temperatures (lower than 150C or 238F).

Dividing stem cell in the brain

Paula Alexandre, University College London

This swirling pattern shows different stages of a stem cell splitting in two inside the brain of a zebrafish before it hatches.

The circle is about 250 micrometres (0.25mm) wide, and covers a time period of nine hours.

Starting at about the eight o'clock position, the cell splits to make two different cells found in the brain.

""It helps us visualise embryonic development by showing nature's beautifully orchestrated process of stem cell division - producing a new (purple) stem cell and a differentiated (white) nerve cell,"" says Anne Deconinck, executive director of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, in the US.

Ebola virus

David S Goodsell, RCSB Protein Data Bank

""This illustration shows the internal structure of an Ebola virus particle, with the central core in three dimensions so you can see the internal structures more clearly,"" says visual artist Rob Kesseler, professor at Central Saint Martins at the University of the Arts London.

The Ebola virus is about 100 nanometres (0.0001mm) wide - 200 times smaller than many of the cells that it infects.

""The illustrator chooses pastel colours rather than tonal contrast to show the different elements of this tiny, often lethal virus.

""It shows how illustration can uniquely show many different levels of detail simultaneously, with great beauty and clarity.""

Infectious disease containment unit

David Bishop, Royal Free Hospital, London

""This photograph provides a rare glimpse inside the UKs only high-level isolation unit, taken the day before a nurse was admitted after contracting Ebola,"" says judge Rob Kesseler.

""It perfectly captures the calm before the storm, ghostly empty shapes of protective clothing hang, waiting for the patient to be rushed in.""

This special see-through tent surrounds a bed in the Royal Free Hospital in London. All air leaving the unit is cleaned, so the patient can be safely treated without putting other patients or staff at risk.

Nurse Will Pooley made a full recovery.

Swallowtail butterfly

Daniel Saftner, Macroscopic Solutions

""It was chosen because it shows so clearly what the mouthparts and the eyes of a swallowtail butterfly look like in really striking detail,"" says judge Eric Hilaire, science, environment and global development online picture editor at the Guardian.

Butterflies have two big round eyes for seeing quick movements and two antennae for smelling.

They also have a long feeding tube, which is curled up like a spring here, but it unrolls so the butterfly can use it like a straw to drink nectar from flowers.

Moth scales

Mark R Smith, Macroscopic Solutions

""The colour here is actually an optical illusion,"" explains judge Eric Hilaire.

""The scales themselves don't contain much pigment, it's the way light bounces off the curves which gives them their apparent colour.""

The scales belong to a Madagascan sunset moth - which sparkles with colour in the light and is often mistaken for a butterfly.

This picture is 750 micrometres (0.75mm) wide.

Inside the human eye

Peter Maloca, University of Basel

""Here we're looking inside blood vessels at the back of the human eye, which also supply the retina,"" says judge Robin Lovell-Badge of this 3D picture.

""The blood itself is moving too fast to be visible creating this maze of tunnels that looks like a subterranean landscape. It draws your eye towards what appears to be a light at the end.""

Pictures like this are used by doctors to help spot early signs of eye disease. These tiny tunnels are about 100 micrometres (0.1mm) tall.

Blood vessels in the eye

Kim Baxter, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust

""What's fascinating about this is that, when you see it, you don't automatically think of the eye,"" says judge Rob Kesseler. ""It appears like an aerial view of a city at night or a telescopic image of a distant galaxy.""

The image was created by photographing the blood vessels in the retina - seen here as white spidery lines - as fluorescent dye was passed through.

Detecting stroke

Nicholas Evans, University of Cambridge

""This demonstrates beautifully one of the deadliest two centimetres of pathology in human medicine and is an excellent tool to explain the causation of cerebrovascular accidents, or strokes, to patients,"" explains Dirk Pilat.

This medical scan shows, in green, a blocked blood vessel inside the neck of a person.

This vessel carries blood to the brain and when it gets blocked, parts of the brain can get damaged and stop working properly.

Cow heart

Michael Frank, Royal Veterinary College

""This image is striking in its three dimensional sculptural appearance, especially when you know that the heart itself is actually a specimen in a jar,"" says Catherine Draycott.

""Beautifully lit and photographed to bring to life an old historical specimen - highlighting both the external surface and internal structures.""

Windows have been cut into this cow's heart to show what is inside. It is about four times the size of a human heart.

Engineering human liver tissue

Chelsea Fortin, Kelly Stevens and Sangeeta Bhatia, Koch Institute, MIT

This small piece of human liver has been put into a mouse with a damaged liver. The human liver has started to grow, with help from the mouse's blood.

""It is tissue engineering in action,"" says Anne Deconinck from the Koch Institute.

""In response to tissue damage, cells can reorganise and heal, and even develop much-needed blood vessels.

""This image with the heart-shaped patch of engineered liver cells beautifully conveys a message of hope - and the promise of scientific advancements to overcome the challenges of replacement organ shortages and disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer.""

This image appears as a result of the partnership between Wellcome Images and the Koch Institute at MIT, Cambridge, USA.

Bacteria on graphene oxide

Izzat Suffian, Kuo-Ching Mei, Houmam Kafa and Khuloud T Al-Jamal, King's College London

""This image serves really well to illustrate the fact that graphene, a recently discovered material, is just one atom thick,"" says Catherine Draycott.

""The details of the creases in the graphene contrast with the enormous torpedo shaped bacteria, which we know to be very small organisms.""

Graphene - seen here in purple - is an extremely thin sheet of carbon, and is one of the thinnest, strongest materials so far discovered.

Researchers are trying to stick different medicines to it so they can be carried to the right place in the body when needed. The bacteria are about two micrometres (0.002mm) long.

Premature baby receiving light therapy

David Bishop, Royal Free Hospital, London

This baby was born early and has jaundice, a common condition which turns the skin and eyes yellow.

The baby is being treated in an incubator at Barnet Hospital in north London, and lies under a blue coloured light, with eyes covered.

""One of the reasons this was picked is that it is intimate yet respectful - due to the framing and angle of the photograph,"" says Catherine Draycott.

Clathrin cage

Maria Voigt, RCSB Protein Data Bank

""Clathrin is a protein found in cells, and here molecules of it have come together to form this cage like structure which helps move things around the cell,"" explains judge Eric Hilaire.

""The illustration and its shading bring out the three dimensional nature of this structure.""

Cells can have lots of these tiny cages inside them. This cage measures about 50 nanometres (0.00005mm) across.

When the cage is not being used it breaks up into smaller pieces, which get recycled. The cage can be put back together again when it's next needed.

Toxoplasmosis-causing parasites

Leandro Lemgruber, University of Glasgow

""It looks quite blurry because of the extreme magnification of this tiny parasite which causes toxoplasmosis,"" says judge Robin Lovell-Badge.

""This infinitesimally small organism, found in infected cat faeces and raw or undercooked meat, is particularly dangerous to pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.""

Here, DNA inside each parasite (blue/green) is surrounded by membrane (red) and protein (black).

This image was created using a type of super-resolution microscopy. Each parasite measures 10 micrometres (0.01mm) long.

Bone development

Frank Acquaah

""Here modern technology is used on historical remains,"" says Catherine Draycott. ""The images are made with micro-computed tomography - penetrating wave scans - which show how the internal structure of the bone evolves as a baby develops in the womb and after birth.""

Each circle shows bone from an infant at a different age. The youngest (three months before birth) is on the left and the oldest (2.5 years old) is on the right. These historical bones all come from the skeletons of children who died in the 19th Century.

Maize leaves

Fernan Federici, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile and University of Cambridge

""This image evokes the work of Gustav Klimt with its beautiful, gilded mosaic look,"" says Anne Deconinck from the Koch Institute.

This is a confocal micrograph looking inside a cluster of leaves from a young maize (corn) plant.

Each curled leaf is made up of lots of small cells (small green square and rectangle shapes) - and inside each cell is a nucleus (orange circle), the part of the cell which stores genetic information.

The overall winner of the Wellcome Image Awards will be announced on the evening of Tuesday 15 March 2016 at the Science Museum in London - where all the images will be on display until Sunday 19 June 2016.

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,Ponto de vista: O homem cordial brasileiro em tempos de intolerancia nas redes sociais,['Ricardo Calazans'],"Image copyright iStock

Ha pouco mais de uma semana, antes de o pais rachar em dois, ouvi um raciocinio instigante de um executivo que lida com gente de todas as nacionalidades: ""O brasileiro e o povo com a autoimagem mais distorcida do mundo. O problema e que a imagem que o estrangeiro tem do Brasil tambem nao corresponde a realidade"".

No Brasil, neste exato momento, ha muitas ""verdades"" - e quanto mais ""verdades"" ha, mais dificil e entender o que corresponde (de fato) a realidade.

Desde que o ex-presidente Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva foi ""conduzido coercitivamente"" a sala da Policia Federal no aeroporto paulistano de Congonhas, na ultima sexta-feira, eu so leio ""verdades"" nas redes sociais. De um lado, temos um golpe em pleno curso; de outro, nossas instituicoes democraticas nunca foram tao solidas.

Entre uma e outra ""verdade"", ha 500 tons de informacoes que poderiam nos dar pistas mais claras sobre para onde nossa sociedade esta caminhando. Esses, porem, nao alcancam as frequencias de quem apostou na radicalizacao e escolheu nao ouvir o(s) outro(s) lado(s). Na era do ""block"", do ""unfriend"" e do ""unfollow"", estamos pregando apenas para convertidos.

Quanto mais virulento o ativismo, mais pobre e o debate (Fernanda Torres que o diga). As pessoas estao passando por cima de suas amizades - ainda que virtuais - para nao abrir mao de seus pontos de vista. Desenvolveram intolerancia a opiniao alheia. Nao e por acaso que a inepcia de Gloria Pires ao comentar o Oscar (""nao sou capaz de opinar"") tenha sido tao celebrada e tomada como ""mantra"" e meme para evitar confusoes na rede.

Cada vez mais gente pensa uma (duas, dez) vezes antes de dizer o que pensa nos ambientes digitais, e geralmente sucumbe ao silencio para nao ""se meter em tretas"". Mais seguro, certamente. Porem, um contrassenso mortal para a natureza aberta da world wide web que Tim Berners-Lee imaginou para a Humanidade.

""A invencao da www envolveu minha crescente compreensao de que havia um grande poder em se organizar ideias de maneira livre, como uma teia"", costuma dizer Berners-Lee sobre sua invencao revolucionaria. Sobre invencoes, alias, o jornalista Steven Johnson nos lembra que ""estimulo nao conduz necessariamente a criatividade. Colisoes, sim - as colisoes que ocorrem quando diferentes campos de conhecimento convergem num espaco fisico ou intelectual compartilhado. E ai que verdadeiras centelhas voam"". *

Image copyright Reproducao Facebook Image caption Quanto menos espaco damos as opinioes diferentes das nossas, mais proximos estamos da virulencia e das ofensas nas redes sociais

Isso vale tanto para invencoes cientificas como pra reflexoes cotidianas - seja sobre politica, inclusao social ou cinema hollywoodiano. Ambientes caoticos, como uma timeline livre de ""limpezas ideologicas"", sempre serao mais ricos do que os perfis higienizados em epocas de crises e nervos a flor da pele. Quanto menos espaco damos ao contraditorio, menos informacao temos. E quanto menos informacao, maior a ignorancia.

Dai para as ofensas, bloqueios e ""linchamentos"" no Facebook ou, fisicamente pior, troca de socos e pontapes nas ruas, e um pulo, como temos verificado nos ultimos tempos. Estamos indo da civilidade a selvageria num atimo quando o nosso ""lado"" e contestado. E essa tem sido uma constante assustadora. O que e o brasileiro, afinal?

Era disso que Sergio Buarque de Holanda tratava quando lancou, ha exatos 80 anos, o conceito de ""homem cordial"", seu esforco para tracar um perfil psicologico do nosso povo em seu livro Raizes do Brasil, publicado em 1936. Por cordial, o historiador nao se referia a hospitalidade, expansividade ou simpatia como nossas vocacoes ""naturais"", e sim ao habito de agir - e reagir - mais com o coracao (do latim cordis) do que com a razao.

Aqui, observou o pai de Chico Buarque em sua obra classica, ""cada individuo afirma-se ante os seus semelhantes indiferentes a lei geral, onde esta lei contrarie suas afinidades emotivas, e atento apenas ao que o distingue dos demais, do resto do mundo"".

Nossas conviccoes se adequam a nossos interesses privados, mesmo quando tratamos de temas de interesse publico (o popular ""farinha pouca, meu pirao primeiro""). E um exercicio permanente de adaptacao da realidade. Nao e assim hoje mesmo?

Experimente escolher um lado em politica. Para ficar no caso que mais nos causa comocao: contra ou a favor do Partido dos Trabalhadores - que, alias, teve em Sergio Buarque de Holanda um de seus fundadores.

Muita gente tem deixado de expressar o que pensa sobre a operacao Lava Jato, as acusacoes que pesam sobre Lula, a presidente Dilma e seu governo, por medo de ter colado na testa epitetos como ""coxinha"", ""petralha"", ""fascista"", ""pelego""... Ou de ser alvo de alguma perseguicao virtual mais grave.

Os que, ao contrario, partem para a defesa de um lado ou outro, o fazem quase sempre de maneira absoluta, alergicos ao que os contraria e orgulhosos das ""faxinas"" que eliminam opinioes diversas. Sem ter suas proprias crencas colocadas em perspectiva, o que resta e um crescente fanatismo.

Portanto, oucamos Steven Johnson: sem colisoes (de ideias!, nao de tapas), nao ha crescimento. Apenas verdades absolutas. Apenas certezas fatais. Apenas uma triste polarizacao que incomoda e assusta.

""E o confronto de duas humanidades tao diversas, tao heterogeneas, tao verdadeiramente ignorantes, agora sim, uma da outra, que nao deixa de impor-se entre elas uma intolerancia mortal"", dizia o historiador em 1936. Referia-se a indigenas e colonizadores, mas a frase cabe perfeitamente nas rusgas entre ""petralhas"" e ""coxinhas"".

O Brasil ja foi ""um pais do futuro"", imaginado pelo austriaco Stefan Zweig em 1940. Se ele baixasse aqui hoje, o que pensaria destes ""homens cordiais"" entrincheirados raivosamente em suas proprias conviccoes, tal como ha oito decadas atras? Como em 1936, o Brasil hoje e puro coracao, mas seu futuro esta em xeque. Nossa cordialidade sempre ocultou uma violencia, que pode se tornar extrema em momentos delicados como o que vivemos agora. E hora de dar ouvidos a razao.

Donald Trump continued his march towards the Republican Party nomination in the US by taking three more primaries. And where there's a Trump win, there's a social media reaction.

This time it was #ifTrumpwins that gathered momentum, bringing hope and levity to the serious world of campaign politics.

Or, that was the intention when Comedy Central's Midnight programme incited its 500,000 followers to play with the hashtag.

Image copyright @midnight

Over 10,500 tweets mention both @midnight and #iftrumpwins, making up nearly 40% of the original tweets on the hashtag.

The trend peaked at 7,468 tweets in the hour 0500-0600GMT with the fearful perspective of Dubai-based EDM producer Shuja Rabbani a top tweet.

Image copyright @ShujaRabbani

Two tweets from @PoliticsJim helped drive the trend, garnering more than 6,000 retweets between them. Both involved satirising Trump's campaign slogan of ""Make America Great Again"".

One involves a playful take on popular American painter and TV personality Bob Ross, whose PBS programme The Joy of Painting brought him worldwide fame in the 1980s and 1990s.

Another saw Jim subverting the slogan with cake, transforming it to ""Bake America Cake Again"" - a sentiment all Americans passionate about patisserie can get behind, regardless of politics.

Judging by the spread of branded wine, water and meat Trump brought to his post-victory press conference, no one is going to go hungry if he wins.

bbc.com,,Hunt for the grey ghost,[],"Spotter K.C. Namgyal at work

Immediately before the BBC Earth team arrived, nine cats had been spotted in 12 days, so the signs were promising. Anderson had assembled a large team, reasoning that to get good footage he needed ample time in the field and a team big enough to cover all the angles. Before they left, the team trained in mountain rescue and avalanche safety in the Rocky Mountains of Idaho, US. With three camera operators, two assistants, and 11 local guides, spotters, porters and support staff, the shoot in Ladakh took six weeks. Anderson was excited about filming snow leopards, but also nervous. ""They are still incredibly rare, incredibly elusive, and it's a hard place to work with the altitude and weather,"" he says. As a result, his first sighting was a memorable experience. He looked through the telescope and saw a snow leopard over a kilometre away. It wasn't the best quality sighting that you can ever imagine, but it was just so exciting, he says. ""It was an amazing moment,"" says Anderson, ""one that I'll always remember.""

Hints of the grey ghost of the mountains through a scope

One of the lead camera operators was John Shier of 45 North Films, who has a reputation for capturing spectacular footage of large animals and difficult habitats. He had already worked on big cats, having filmed North American pumas, but the project was his first trip to India, first foray into the Himalayas, and first opportunity to sight a snow leopard. ""My first impression was that it was a very beautiful place, with a warm culture,"" says Shier. ""The other thing I noticed right away was that ecotourism is gaining a strong foothold."" In North America, visitors to national parks are familiar with the phenomenon of a ""bear jam"". In Hemis, says Shier, there were snow leopard jams, with 20 to 30 tourists crowding around on the trail, trying to see the cats. So the BBC crew trekked ""to places the tourists dont normally go to,"" says Shier. It paid off: the crew spotted five cats in their first five days.

Tourist season in Hemis National Park

For camera operator Mateo Willis, arriving in Ladakh stirred a flood of memories. On previous family treks to the region he had constantly scanned for snow leopards, but only caught a couple of fleeting glimpses. ""Literally a pinprick in binoculars,"" he says. Returning to the region was the realisation of a dream. Doing so also came with risks, one of which was potentially fatal altitude sickness. The team landed at over 3500m in Leh, and their filming location in Rumbak was another 500m higher. At that altitude, it is not recommended to ascend more than 500m per day. They took four rest days upon arrival at base camp, ""to really slowly work ourselves up into peak condition so we could be tracking the cats all over the mountains,"" says Anderson. They took oxygen and a depressurisation chamber. Being so remote, they were unlikely to get rescued by helicopter if there was an emergency. Each day, the entire team did a questionnaire to watch for signs and symptoms of altitude sickness. ""No matter how many times you've visited high-elevation locations,"" says Willis, ""there is always an element of uncertainty."" Fortunately, there were no medical incidents, no bad storms, and very little snow. However lighting conditions were a challenge. Light bounced around a lot, reflecting from the pale rock. Heat and ultra violet radiation were also a problem. Sometimes, says Anderson, ""we were desperate for shade.""

bbc.com,,Dilma Rousseff: Facing a perfect storm,"['Vanessa Buschschluter', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Reuters Image caption Dilma Rousseff's government survived mass anti-government protests in 2013 but is now facing a host of new problems

Dilma Rousseff, the first woman to be elected president of Brazil, has had her share of career ups and downs.

But even a leader used to the rollercoaster of Brazilian politics could hardly have predicted what some analysts are calling ""a perfect storm"".

Four years ago, when Ms Rousseff attended the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London, she would have been looking forward to 2016 as a year when she could shine.

Brazil had recently overtaken the UK to become the world's sixth-biggest economy with a growth of 2.7%.

While by 2012 growth was beginning to slow down, the economy was still expanding and Ms Rousseff was probably hoping that the prospect of hosting the 2016 Summer Olympics would attract further investment.

Downward spiral

Instead, the news in the years since have been dominated by stories about delays in the construction of some facilities and pollution in Rio's famous bay.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption In 2012, things were looking a lot rosier for President Rousseff

Other host countries have of course also suffered from delays and doubts about their ability to pull off the Games, but Brazil and its president have had to face added difficulties.

An economy whose performance had been praised has tanked.

The country is already going through its worst recession in more than two decades and it does not look set to recover anytime soon.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts Brazil's economy will have contracted by almost 8% between January 2015 and December 2016.

But it is not just the poor performance of the economy which is giving Ms Rousseff a headache.

In the past months, an outbreak of a virus which was first identified in monkeys in Uganda in 1947 has hit the headlines.

The Zika virus, which in many cases just causes mild flu-like symptoms, has been linked to a growing number of babies being born with underdeveloped brains in Brazil.

In February, the World Health Organization declared the cluster of microcephaly in Latin America a global emergency.

Little trust

These developments come at a time when trust in Brazilian politicians has been eroded by a massive corruption scandal involving top politicians from various parties.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Operation Lava Jato (Car Wash) has uncovered corruption at the highest level in state-oil giant Petrobras and other firms

The investigation into the scandal, Operation Car Wash, has already led to the arrest of dozens of politicians, some of them high-ranking members of Ms Rousseff's Workers' Party.

The party treasurer, Joao Vaccari Neto, has been sentenced to 15 years and four months in jail for corruption and money laundering.

Just days ago, a judge issued an arrest warrant for Ms Rousseff's campaign manager, Joao Santana.

Mentor under the spotlight

And most damagingly for Ms Rousseff, her political mentor and predecessor in office, ex-President Lula, was briefly detained by police for questioning on 4 March by investigators from Operation Car Wash.

Image copyright AP Image caption Ex-President Lula has angrily rejected the allegations of corruption made against him

While prosecutors said that Ms Rousseff was not under investigation for Operation Car Wash, she is fighting her own battles in Congress, where there are attempts under way to impeach her.

Her political rivals are accusing her of using the country's pension fund to shore up budget gaps, which she denies.

All of the above have caused her approval ratings to plummet.

According to a poll by Datafolha, just 11% of respondents across the country said the president's performance was ""good or excellent"".

Despite this series of blows against her and her administration, Ms Rousseff seems undeterred.

Following Lula's much-publicised questioning, she said the investigations ""must continue so those responsible are punished"".

It would seem she wants to ride the storm rather than be drowned in it.",[]

bbc.com,,An anti-social experiment,"['Technology Correspondent', 'Rory Cellan-jones']","Media caption Can students from Tarporley High School in Cheshire last a week on a digital detox?

Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter - social media tools that only entered our lives in the last decade but quickly became indispensable. Now a thousand school children in Cheshire are trying to find out what life was like in the era before social media.

BBC News School Report and BBC Radio 5 live have challenged pupils at Tarporley High School to go through a digital detox. From last Wednesday they agreed to give up all social media, YouTube and video games for a week. Some adults - not me, I hasten to add - might think that was pretty painless. After all, the pupils' phones were not being confiscated and they were still allowed to call, email or text.

But what this experiment has shown so far is just how central to the lives of teenagers social networks and messaging tools have become. Three of the Year-10 students have been reporting on the detox for School Report. Here's what they say about the assembly where the idea was explained:

""The thought of having real conversations and maybe even reading a book seems to be way too much to handle. Many hands are raised when asked who uses games but pretty much everyone seems to use social media on a day to day basis."" One teacher tells the reporters he welcomes the experiment: ""Social media is becoming increasingly invasive, verging on obsessive.""

But if your primary means of communication is taken away that is bound to cause problems. Twenty five years ago, teenagers would have been furious if they had been told they could not use the home telephone. Today, taking away Snapchat or Facebook Messenger can provoke a similar reaction.

It was bad enough on school days, but the pupils had been dreading a weekend without social media. So on Monday I spoke to three of the pupils to see how they were getting on. Daisy, who's 14, said she had been quite positive about the experiment in advance - she had worked out she had spent 16 hours on Snapchat the previous week and was quite looking forward to not feeling the pressure to check her phone all the time.

But she had found it hard over the weekend: ""I had to turn off notifications not to be tempted."" She had rediscovered some old forms of communication - sending emails to friends abroad, and even making phone calls.

""I'm not totally obsessed, I do have a normal life,"" says 15-year-old Georgia about her use of social media. But beforehand she still worried what her friends would think if she simply disappeared from social media. Seeing that she had Snapchat messages that she could not open had been really hard, but there has been an upside: ""I've been looking at newspapers and magazines,"" she says, ""and talking to my parents about other things than them being my taxi drivers!""

Patrick, who's 14 and spends a lot of time watching YouTube and talking to friends while playing Fifa, had found the weekend painful. ""I was in the car and I must have picked up the phone 50 times and then put it down."" Organising meetings with friends had been difficult - he had to phone them individually. ""None of us speak on the phone or email. It's more efficient to use things like Snapchat - it's cheaper and nobody is listening.""

Of the 1,000 pupils who started the digital detox, around a quarter have so far admitted to giving up. Among them is Sam, who broke the pledge when he was due to play tennis and didn't have the phone number of the student he was due to meet. He never calls anyone and has no numbers stored in his phone, so the only answer was to use Snapchat to make the arrangement.

It sounds as though most of the school's pupils will be mightily relieved when the detox ends and they can return to the modern communications era. But the Tarporley High School librarian might like the experiment to continue - she says she has never seen as many books borrowed as during the last week.",[]

The delegate tracker

Winning delegates, the people who endorse a candidate at the party conventions in July, is key to securing the nomination.

Your browser does not support the iframe HTML tag. Try viewing this in a modern browser like Chrome, Safari, Firefox or Internet Explorer 9 or later.

The totals include the delegates won per state, as well as so-called ""unpledged"" or ""super delegates"".

They are generally party leaders or elected officials, though the Democrats include former officials as well. Each super delegate is entitled to one vote at the convention.

AP conducts surveys of these super delegates, and adds them to a candidate's totals if they indicate their support. In the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton has gained the support of more than 1,000 super delegates so far.

Super delegates can - and do - change their minds during the course of the campaign, so the figures may shift as the race unfolds.

The delegate tracker is updated automatically. There may be a short delay between the delegates being assigned and the totals changing.",[]

bbc.com,,Steven Avery's lawyer claims 'airtight alibi' in Making a Murderer case,[],"This is Steven Avery, a 53-year-old American, who is currently serving a life sentence for murder.

He's always denied killing 25-year-old Teresa Halbach, whose remains were found close to Avery's home in 2005.

Now his new lawyer claims he has an ""airtight alibi"" proving once and for all that it wasn't him.

This is potentially huge news for the Avery family and anyone who has binge-watched the 10-part Netflix documentary, Making a Murderer.

Kathleen Zellner has reportedly filed an appeal for her client, which is due to be heard in court.

And she's been tweeting about what she might argue.

The lawyer claims only details of the incoming and outgoing phone calls were heard during Avery's original trial and that there is now more detailed information available.

Prosecutors claim Teresa Halbach was last seen at Avery's salvage yard when she disappeared.

The (epic) backstory

Avery was wrongfully imprisoned for 18 years for sexual assault.

In 1985 he was charged and convicted for sexual assault, false imprisonment and attempted murder.

But in 2003 he was released when advances in DNA technology proved it was another man.

After being set free and living a normal life for a short while, he was then accused and found guilty of the Halbach murder.

Many think he was set up by law officials in Manitowoc County, Wisconsin, who feared they faced a huge financial penalty over the first case.

But those officials have always dismissed the claims as conspiracy theory.

The bones of a new species of extinct hominin called Homo naledi were discovered in the Rising Star Cave in South Africa and unveiled to the world in September 2015.

The new species had a primitive braincase but fairly modern hands and feet, which is a strange mixture.

To find out more, BBC Earth spoke to Professor Chris Stringer at London's Natural History Museum, where the reconstructed hand and jaw of H. naledi was on display as part of a new exhibition on human evolution.

The new species has not yet been dated, and is not expected to be until at least the end of 2016. But researchers believe it could sit right at the base of the line Homo, that led to us.

If it does, it was one of the earliest humans ever to walk the Earth, as Stringer explains in the video above.

bbc.com,,"Syria conflict: Spring truce brings calm, but for how long?","['Chief International Correspondent', 'Lyse Doucet']","Media caption A truce has enabled aid to reach some areas for the first time in two years

Even the harshest of winters eventually end, as do the most punishing of wars. And this year, spring's arrival in Syria coincides with the quietest spell for a long time in this conflict.

But after five years of unparalleled protest and pain, most Syrians don't dare to believe that the fledgling truce here, now in its second week, will last.

""We hope and we pray,"" says Ruba when we meet in a park in Damascus, where fruit trees are in pink blossom and families are picnicking in warm spring sunshine.

""We used to think that after one year, it would be over, then after two years, but we're waiting, waiting, waiting.""

No one expected this war would last so long and cost so much.

In the park, you can hear the whoosh of skipping ropes and roller skates. Ruba's friend, displaced from a war-torn suburb, wobbles past with a big brave smile, balancing precariously on her son's hoverboard.

Soundtrack of Damascus

This is not quite a truce, it is a cessation of hostilities. Largely brokered by Moscow and Washington, it is partial and imperfect, fragile and possibly fleeting. But never has there been such significant and sustained pressure from all the outside players - 17 in all - on Syria's warring factions.

Largely gone is what has long been the soundtrack of Damascus: the rumble of government warplanes across city skies heading for opposition strongholds; the distant thump of artillery; the thud of mortars fired into the city.

Image caption The sound of children playing has returned to the parks of Damascus

In rebel-held areas, just kilometres away but a world apart, the respite is even greater.

Safe for now from devastating air strikes and shelling, crowds surged through the streets last Friday in a show of strength which hasn't been seen for years. Videos posted on social media showed Syrians turning out, in their thousands, in opposition areas across the country.

Even in places which witnessed some of the worst of the fighting, defiance is undiminished. The protesters call for President Bashar al-Assad to go, just as they did when uprising began five years ago.

But the fighting continues on some strategic frontlines, including the embattled city of Aleppo. Not a day passes without violations being reported.

There were even two airstrikes just east of Damascus which allowed the government to advance a bit further into a strategic belt of farmland. And UN-designated terrorist groups including the so-called Islamic State and al-Qaeda affiliate Nusra Front aren't part of this deal.

Rebels or terrorists?

""We want this truce to work, "" a senior Syrian military officer says. ""Syrians worry their country could be divided."" But attempts to clarify exactly which opposition forces fall under the rubric of terrorist groups quickly gets bogged down in definitions.

""This war will end when the West stops backing terrorists,"" the officer says. That includes ""moderate terrorists"", he adds.

His comments underscore a fundamental dispute at the heart of the process - which groups are legitimate targets of attack, and which are not because they are expected to be part of any future negotiations.

Syria, and its powerful Russian ally, are both accused of attacking some of the very groups that the opposition, with its Western and Arab backers, include in their delegations.

""We made a decision to remain quiet because if we break the truce, the blame will be put on our side,"" said a spokesman for the opposition's High Negotiations Committee Salem al-Meslet, in a telephone call shortly after the truce began. ""We had difficulties convincing our people to commit,"" he added.

Image caption A Syrian family relax in a park in Damascus

However fragile, this truce is beginning to make a difference where it matters - some of nearly half a million Syrians trapped in areas under siege are finally receiving desperately-needed food and medicine.

""In the first part of 2015, we were able to reach 0% of these areas with aid,"" Yacoub El Hillo, the UN's humanitarian coordinator in Syria, says. ""In the first part of this year we've reached 30%.""

The hard part

But every delivery is painstakingly slow. A convoy last Friday into three rebel-held towns in East Ghouta just outside Damascus took days of negotiations, including phone calls to Saudi Arabia, the main backer of the most powerful rebel group, and to other allies.

And some medical supplies are still being taken off convoys heading into areas under siege or hard to reach.

""If you can't allow vaccines for children under five years old and can't allow medical supplies, even if it's surgical equipment or trauma kits used to treat people, not just fighters, then it's difficult to imagine that parties to this conflict will agree on many bigger existential issues in the political process,"" says Mr El Hillo.

And that's the point. Many involved in this war still believe they can prevail militarily.

""We're starting with the easy part - saving lives - and we want to build on that,"" Mr El Hillo says.

In Syria, that is hard enough. The rest is even harder.",[]

Maria Sharapova dinilai ceroboh karena dinyatakan positif mengonsumsi obat yang dilarang oleh Badan Antidoping Dunia atau WADA. Sharapova mengonsumsi meldonium, obat yang dilarang WADA sejak 1 Januari 2016.

Mantan Ketua WADA, Dick Pound, menyatakan Sharapova punya cukup waktu untuk mengetahui perubahan aturan tentang obat-obatan yang dilarang oleh WADA. Meldonium, yang dikonsumsi Sharapova sejak 2006 untuk alasan kesehatan, mulai dikategorikan sebagai obat terlarang bagi atlet pada 1 Januari 2016.

""Tindakan Sharapova sangat ceroboh, karena pemberitahuan adanya perubahan aturan mengenai daftar obat-obatan, sudah disebarkan sejak 30 September lalu.

""Masih ada waktu mulai bulan Oktober, November, dan Desember, sampai peraturan terbaru mengenai obat-obatan yang dilarang akhirnya ditetapkan secara resmi pada Januari 2016. Semua pemain tenis mendapat pemberitahuan ini, mereka juga memiliki tim medis,"" kata Pound kepada BBC Sport.

Meldonium resmi dilarang dalam dunia olah raga, karena dapat mempercepat pergerakan oksigen dalam darah. Seorang atlet yang mengonsumsi meldonium akan memiliki stamina dan daya tahan yang lebih baik.

bbc.com,,Islamic State: An invincible force?,"['Hassan Hassan', 'Authors Of Isis Inside The Army Of Terror', 'Michael Weiss']","Image copyright AP Image caption IS' capture of large swathes of territory in 2014 sent shockwaves around the world

In June 2014, so-called Islamic State (IS) took over the Iraqi city of Mosul. Within weeks, the organisation had swept through large swathes in Iraq and Syria, seizing a territory the size of the United Kingdom.

The territory IS controls has shrunk in the two years since a US-led multinational coalition launched an air campaign on its positions, first in Iraq and then Syria.

The coalition has managed to push IS out of the Iraqi cities of Tikrit and Ramadi, as well as an ever-increasing stretch of Syrian-Turkish borderland.

Enemies of the ""caliphate"", backed by (mostly) US fighter jets, are now bivouacked 50km (30 miles) from the IS ""capital"" of Raqqa, in northern Syria.

Yet IS' hold on its most valuable strategic terrain, the areas seized either in or before 2014, is still uncontested.

It is entrenched in Mosul and Raqqa and the Sunni Arab tribal heartland of the Euphrates river valley, which stretches from eastern Syria to western Iraq.

While it has lost much of the northern Syrian borderland, IS has also expanded into areas hitherto resistant to it, such as the Damascus suburbs and parts of the Aleppo countryside.

War spoils

IS' military arsenal consists of Russian and American weaponry mostly seized from government and rebel forces in both Iraq and Syria.

Its stockpiles include a fleet of Humvees seized after it defeated the US-equipped Iraqi army in Mosul and elsewhere.

Image copyright AP Image caption IS has captured US and Russian weaponry and armoured vehicles from its opponents

The group's ability to acquire war spoils in the form of Russian and American tanks, recoilless rifles, rocket-launchers, light arms and ammunition was seriously diminished after it became harder to swiftly seize new territory.

When the campaign started in 2014, the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) said IS could muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters, up from an initial estimate of 10,000.

Despite over a year of air strikes, in February this year the White House said IS still had up to an estimated 25,000 fighters, mainly foreigners, from more than 90 countries.

Turning minds

Despite its fearsome reputation and initial shock grab of territory, IS is not invincible on the battlefield.

The bulk of its rank-and-file infantry, particularly foreign, do not fight well and are often dispatched by their native commanders as cannon fodder.

IS' most capable soldiers, its ""special forces"", have typically been Iraqi and Syrian militants with long experience of fighting in those countries, and graduates of other insurgencies, notably the Libyan-heavy al-Battar Brigade or the various units of militants from Chechnya or elsewhere in the Caucasus.

See where IS have made territorial gains and losses, Jan-Dec 2015 December 2015 January 2015

Where IS has excelled is in the realm of intelligence tradecraft.

This includes the maintenance of a highly elaborate and multilingual propaganda machine that caters to all constituencies, from American Muslims to Iraqi tribesmen.

Using bribery, blackmail and its own totalitarian form of cultural outreach, it has been able to win friends and influence people across thousands of square kilometres, often conquering a town, city or village long before its advancing columns lay siege to it.

IS dispatches cash-strapped sleeper agents into the ranks of its opposition, such as the Iraqi Security Forces or the Free Syrian Army, to slowly, covertly, buy or build a constituency.

Baathist core

IS is in many respects a project of Saddam Hussein's now-outlawed Baath Party, but with a different ideology.

Former agents or officers of the former Iraqi president's regime dominate its leadership.

For instance, Samir Abd Mohammed al-Khlifawi, better known as Hajji Bakr, was a colonel in Saddam's elite intelligence service of Saddam's Air Defence Force.

He was responsible for building IS' infrastructure in northern Syria in 2012 before being killed by anti-Assad rebels.

Another key IS figure was Abu Abdul Rahman al-Bilawi, a former captain in the Iraqi army. He was killed two days before the group's seizure of Mosul in June 2014, an operation whose final blitzkrieg he himself planned and so was accordingly dubbed ""Bilawi Revenge"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Former Iraqi army officers have helped organise and direct IS

Bilawi hailed from Iraq's Dulaim tribe, the country's largest. He was also quite close to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the founder of a precursor to IS.

A third ex-Baathist was Abu Ali al-Anbari, also once an intelligence officer in Saddam's army.

Anbari is the mastermind of the group's espionage and clandestine services, heading the IS Security and Intelligence Council and so tasked with running a vast honeycomb network of spies, operatives and sleeper cells, including those now active in countries beyond Iraq and Syria.

The ex-Baathists shape the group's jihadist ideology, handle its security (weeding out infiltrators or possible putschists) and military operations, and ensure its resilience.

They represent a battle-hardened and state-educated core that would likely endure (as they have done through US occupation and a decade of war) even if the organisation's middle and lower cadres are decimated.

Ex-Baathists have established an underground network, whose operatives are often disguised, even from other members.

This network of sleeper cells and security-minded members represent the organisation's core and, even if IS is defeated or contained militarily, will make it difficult to vanquish all together.

bbc.com,,Googles AI beats world Go champion in first of five matches,[],"Media caption WATCH: The whole match in less than a minute

In a landmark battle between man and artificial intelligence (AI), the world champion of the game Go was narrowly defeated by his computer opponent.

Google's DeepMind AlphaGo program beat South Korea's Lee Se-dol in the first of a series of games in Seoul.

In October 2015, AlphaGo beat the European Go champion, an achievement that was not expected for years.

A computer has beaten the world chess champion, but the Chinese game Go is seen as significantly more complex.

The BBC's Stephen Evans in Seoul said Mr Lee appeared ""nervous, sighing and shaking his head"" at the outset of the match.

Throughout most of the game he had seemed to have the upper hand but in the last 20 minutes, AlphaGo took an unassailable lead. Mr Lee then forfeited, handing victory to his opponent.

""I was very surprised because I did not think that I would lose the game,"" said Mr Lee.

""A mistake I made at the very beginning lasted until the very last.""

The Go player has won 18 world championships since turning professional at the age of 12.

He said AlphaGo's early strategy was ""excellent'' and that he was stunned by one unconventional move it had made that a human never would have played.

Despite his initial loss though, he did not regret accepting the challenge.

""I had a lot of fun playing Go and I'm looking forward to the future games,'' he said.

The two sides will play a total of five games over the coming days for a prize of about $1m (700,000).

Algorithm vs intuition

The five-day battle is being seen as a major test of what scientists and engineers have achieved in the sphere of artificial intelligence.

Go is a 3,000-year old Chinese board game and is considered to be a lot more complex than chess where artificial intelligence scored its most famous victory to date when IBM's Deep Blue beat grandmaster Gary Kasparov in 1997.

But experts say Go presents an entirely different challenge because of the game's incomputable number of move options which means that the computer must be capable of human-like ""intuition"" to prevail.

Image copyright Google Image caption ""I hope this advanced technology will be used for useful things,"" Mr Lee told the BBC

""Playing against a machine is very different from an actual human opponent,"" Mr Lee told the BBC ahead of the match.

""Normally, you can sense your opponent's breathing, their energy. And lots of times you make decisions which are dependent on the physical reactions of the person you're playing against.

""With a machine, you can't do that.""

What is Go?

Media caption A brief guide to Go

Go is thought to date back to ancient China, several thousand years ago.

Using black-and-white stones on a grid, players gain the upper hand by surrounding their opponents pieces with their own.

The rules are simpler than those of chess, but a player typically has a choice of 200 moves compared with about 20 in chess.

There are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe, according to DeepMind's team.

It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human players rely on instinct.

Learning from mistakes

Google's AlphaGo was developed by British computer company DeepMind which was bought by Google in 2014.

Media caption Go champion Lee Se-dol says he is not sure he will be the ""clear winner""

The computer program first studied common patterns that are repeated in past games, Demis Hassabis, DeepMind chief executive explained to the BBC.

""After it's learned that, it's got to reasonable standards by looking at professional games. It then played itself, different versions of itself millions and millions of times and each time get incrementally slightly better - it learns from its mistakes""

Learning and improving from its own matchplay experience means the super computer is now even stronger than when it beat the European champion late last year.",[]

""Me puso siete u ocho inyecciones y luego me extrajo ocho dientes en una misma cita. Quede chorreando sangre durante tres dias"".

Este es tan solo uno de los testimonios, recogido por la agencia AFP, de los pacientes franceses afectados por la mala praxis del llamado ""dentista del horror"".

El holandes Jacobus Van Nierop comparecio este martes ante la justicia gala para responder a la acusacion de haber mutilado las bocas de un centenar de personas en la pequena localidad de Chateau-Chinon, que tiene una poblacion de unos 3.000 habitantes.

El especialista se enfrenta a cargos de violencia sobre personas vulnerables y fraude que implicarian diez anos de carcel si llegase a ser hallado culpable.

Cuando en 2008 el odontologo de 51 anos llego desde Holanda a esta zona rural del centro de Francia, se convirtio en la esperanza de una poblacion que contaba con unos servicios de salud deficientes, segun explico el corresponsal de la BBC en Paris, Hugh Schofield.

Pero pronto todo se volvio una pesadilla.

Horror

Image copyright AFP Image caption Un grupo de los mas de 100 afectados que acusan al dentista holandes de maltrato estuvo presente en el comienzo del juicio en su contra este martes.

Las victimas alegaron que entre 2008 y 2012 Van Nierop empezo a ""arrancar"" dientes sanos sin motivo, administrando dosis excesivas de anestesia, dejando las encias afectadas y rompiendo mandibulas.

Tambien denunciaron que extraia los rellenos de los dientes para reemplazarlos por un material mas caro y que llego a facturar a la Seguridad Social por sesiones de tan solo 10 minutos.

Una de las afectadas, Sylviane Boulesteix, de 65 anos, conto a los medios franceses que permanecio sin dientes durante un ano luego de que el holandes le arrancara ocho en una sola sesion.

En 2011, el Colegio de Dentistas Quirurgicos de Francia presento una queja contra Van Nierop por practicas ilegales.

Mientras, la Seguridad Social francesa esta investigando irregularidades en la facturacion de sus consultas.

En junio de 2013 fue detenido por las autoridades tras las denuncias de unas 120 victimas.

No obstante, admitio la responsabilidad en los hechos aunque expreso que no recuerda muchos de los casos.

A decisao do juiz Sergio Moro de sentenciar, nesta terca-feira, o empresario Marcelo Odebrecht a 19 anos e 4 meses de prisao por corrupcao e lavagem de dinheiro ""e uma das maiores condenacoes, em termos politicos, nos ultimos 30 anos de democracia brasileira"", avalia o especialista em combate a corrupcao Matthew M. Taylor, professor da American University, em Washington.

Odebrecht, de 47 anos, pertence a terceira geracao da familia que ergueu um dos maiores grupos empresariais do continente, com negocios em 23 paises. Ele estava preso preventivamente desde junho.

Para Moro, as investigacoes comprovaram que Odebrecht, ex-presidente do grupo, pagou mais de R$ 113 milhoes em propinas para que sua empresa conquistasse contratos com a Petrobras, logica que repete a adotada por outras companhias envolvidas no esquema, segundo decisoes anteriores.

Delatores apontaram Odebrecht nao so como um participante, mas como o lider de um cartel que gerenciaria contratos com a estatal  o que as defesas dele e da companhia sempre negaram.

Em nota, um dos advogados do empresario afirmou que a ""sentenca era esperada"" porque a Justica ""havia externado sua conviccao previamente em diversos momentos, nos autos e fora dele"". Tambem afirma que Odebrecht ira recorrer da decisao que considera ""injusta e equivocada, alem de lastreada em provas obtidas ilegalmente"".

Para Taylor, a condenacao ""representa uma mudanca de curso, especialmente se formos pensar que se sabe sobre corrupcao por parte de empresarios ha muitos anos no Brasil. Entao, o fato de um deles, eu diria o maior de todos eles, nao so estar preso, mas ter sido condenado, e um grande avanco"".

""Certamente e a condenacao mais importante ate o momento na operacao Lava Jato"", disse, em entrevista por telefone a BBC Brasil.

Taylor e autor de estudos internacionais sobre democracia e corrupcao no Brasil e chegou a ser professor do curso de Ciencias Politicas da USP entre 2006 e 2011. Junto com Timothy Power, publicou o livro Corruption and Democracy in Brazil: The Struggle for Accountability (Corrupcao e democracia no Brasil: a luta por responsabilizacao).

Image copyright Other Image caption Iniciativas da Lava Jato tambem geram polemica, entre elas a da delacao premiada; acima, juiz Sergio Moro

O pesquisador destaca o fato de que Odebrecht, assim como outros executivos que tem sido investigados e presos na Lava Jato, ""nao sao apenas empresarios, mas atores politicos muito relevantes"", na medida em que suas empreiteiras estavam entre as maiores doadoras de campanhas eleitorais (no ano passado, uma decisao do STF proibiu doacoes de empresas a partidos e politicos).

""Ou seja sao atores relevantes nao apenas por sua forca como empresarios, mas especialmente por sua forca como atores politicos.""

Alcance incerto

Apesar de considerar a Lava Jato um marco no combate a corrupcao, Taylor diz que a amplitude do seu impacto, porem, ainda nao esta clara.

De um lado, o professor acredita que a sentenca recebida por Odebrecht pode levar a novos acordos de delacao premiada por parte de empresarios interessados em tentar reduzir sua penas, o que representa novos riscos para o governo e politicos investigados.

No momento, a presidente Dilma Rousseff enfrenta o risco de perder seu mandato em um processo de impeachment no Congresso ou por meio de uma eventual condenacao no Tribunal Superior Eleitoral em acoes que investigam suposto uso de recursos desviados da Petrobras em sua campanha presidencial de 2014.

""Certamente poucos entendem tao bem do que foi feito (em esquemas de corrupcao) do que empresarios como Odebrecht. Isso (novos acordos de delacao) seria muito perigoso para todos os envolvidos. Certamente aumenta o risco para aqueles que ja estao citados no escandalo"", disse, evitando citar nomes.

De outro lado, acredita Taylor, o impacto mais amplo da Lava Jato deve depender de tres fatores:

1) O que ocorrera com os processos e condenacoes da Lava Jato quando as sentencas de Moro passarem pela analise das instancias superiores da Justica?

2) O que acontecera com os politicos investigados na operacao ao serem julgados pelo STF? Na sua avaliacao, a Corte ""esta lidando com esses processos numa velocidade muito inferior a da propria Lava Jato"".

3) E qual sera a extensao do padrao de atuacao da Lava Jato para os demais orgaos investigativos e o Judiciario?

Taylor nota que no caso dessa operacao houve uma ""conjuncao de fatores extremamente proveitosa"", com a uniao em torno de um mesmo caso de procuradores e policiais federais que ja tinham trabalhado juntos, atuando na jurisdicao da vara de um juiz ""conhecido como um dos maiores entendedores de corrupcao e lavagem de dinheiro"" - no caso, Sergio Moro.

""Eu nao tenho uma resposta a essas tres perguntas, mas acho que elas sao fundamentais para saber se a Lava Jato tera um impacto significativo a longo prazo"", afirma.

""Sera que outras varas de primeira instancia vao comecar a agir da mesma forma (que a de Moro)? Sera que outros procuradores do Ministerio Publico, seja federal ou estaduais, tambem terao sucesso?""

Criticas

Apesar de a Lava Jato estar sendo muito aplaudida, a operacao tambem tem sido alvo de criticas, principalmente de advogados que apontam o suposto o uso da prisao preventiva como forma de pressionar os investigados a assinarem acordos de delacao premiada.

""Eu entendo os criticos porque o instrumento da delacao premiada e muito novo na lei brasileira e, portanto, existe um certo desconhecimento e certa surpresa"", afirma Taylor.

""Mas a delacao premiada e um recurso muito importante. Este processo nao teria avancado de forma tao contundente sem esse instrumento"", defende.",[]

bbc.com,,Tuition fees: Is England more expensive than US?,"['Sean Coughlan', 'Education Correspondent']","Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption UCLA in Los Angeles has similar tuition fees to UCLAN in Preston

University tuition fees might be high in England but they are not as eye-wateringly expensive as in the United States.

Or at least that's the conventional wisdom.

But is that really true? Or is it based on extreme examples, like Harvard charging almost $60,000 per year (42,000) or Yale $48,000 (34,000)?

How about looking more widely? For instance UCLA compared with UCLAN?

UCLAN is the University of Central Lancashire in Preston - and its preferred acronym nods towards the sunny campus of UCLA, the University of California, Los Angeles, ranked in the world's top 20 universities.

Preston v Los Angeles

They might sound like different worlds, but UCLAN's fees are now more or less the same as UCLA.

The Preston-based university charges 9,000 per year for tuition for undergraduates - and UCLA charges $13,251, which at current rates is about 9,350.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bernie Sanders has promised to scrap tuition fees

A few weeks ago, before sterling fell against the dollar, the fees in California were actually cheaper.

Or if you compare the University of Washington with the University of Wolverhampton, would you expect tuition fees to be lower at Washington?

Tuition fees in Washington are $11,839 (8,354) compared with 9,000 for courses at Wolverhampton - or any other university in England.

The average across US public universities is $9,410 (6,610).

Peggy Blumenthal of the New York-based Institute of International Education says this touches on one of the biggest misconceptions about US higher education.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption University of California, Berkeley has a ""middle class access plan""

""There is a huge range in tuition costs,"" she says. And in practice, many US universities have comparable costs with those in England and across Europe.

State universities - the great engine room of US higher education - have a two-tier fees system, so that students living in the state pay much less than those from outside.

And for state universities, many students live at home, so they avoid all the extra costs for accommodation.

Housing costs

The other confusion is that when US universities quote prices, they often include bed and board as well as tuition.

Parents in England, who can console themselves that tuition fees won't have to be repaid until after graduation, are often taken aback at the separate cost of accommodation and living costs.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption There are growing calls in the US to reduce college costs, while England's fees are set to rise

Even for those painfully expensive private US universities, Ms Blumenthal says the headline figures can be misleading.

""Very few Americans pay the sticker price.

""US universities have a practice of discounting the admissions price. You get a letter saying congratulations, you're admitted to our university, and because you have financial aid, we're going to give this package of loans and scholarships.""

And she says many deals provide a guarantee of work on campus for students, to make it more affordable.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Hillary Clinton has campaigned to make college more affordable

But a spokesman for UCLAN says there are also bursaries for its students - with more than half of first years receiving up to 2,000.

""While there are aspects of the government's fees policy that continue to cause concern we are determined to work within it,"" said the UCLAN spokesman. And he said application figures showed students were not being deterred by cost.

Higher or lower?

But where are fees headed next? And perhaps that is the most striking contrast.

In England, the government has signalled that fees will move upwards above 9,000. Universities have already been pushing to be able to charge more.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Student protests were held against the raising of tuition fees to 9,000

But in the US, the argument has been in the opposite direction - about how costs can be cut. The level of student debt, above a trillion dollars and rising, is increasingly seen as unsustainable.

In the presidential elections, Democrat rivals have been competing to sound the toughest on making college more affordable.

Hillary Clinton is promising a ""New College Compact"" with financial support to help students.

Bernie Sanders has outbid her with the promise to make tuition entirely free in public universities, saying that if Germany can scrap fees, there is no reason why it wouldn't be practical in the United States.

""The middle class has no disposable income because of wage stagnation,"" says Ms Blumenthal.

Middle-class handouts

It means the classic American dream of sending the children to college is proving a financial nightmare.

""If you are a middle-class family and you have two or three children who are going to be in college at the same time, you are totally unable to pay for it.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The American dream of going to college is under financial pressure

""But your income might be such that you do not qualify for grants.""

Universities are now offering help to this squeezed middle, making no secret of who they are targeting.

The University of California, Berkeley, where fees for in-state students are $13,342 (9,400), has launched a ""Middle Class Access Plan"".

This offers financial support to families with a combined income of between $80,000 (57,000) and $150,000 (106,000), who might be income-rich but cash-poor.

Technology to cut costs

The top private universities are also aware of the need to hit the brakes on costs.

John Hennessy, president of Stanford University, told the BBC: ""The levels of debt cannot continue to go up at the rate that they've been going up.

""We're going to have to find a way to deal with that, whether it's income-based repayment or some other scheme.""

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Could online technology reduce the cost of higher education?

He suggests online technology could be the way to reduce costs, so perhaps students could spend part of their time studying online from home, with interactive video classes, as well as spending time on campus.

But he says students can be the most resistant to such changes, wanting no dilution of the complete university experience.

And while fees in England are, in effect, flat - with more or less all universities charging 9,000 - in the US they can have a completely counter-intuitive relationship with quality.

Research from the INSEAD business school in France showed that when US universities had a decline in rankings, they were more likely to increase rather than cut fees.

It was described as the ""Chivas Regal strategy"", in reference to the claim that the whisky brand increased its popularity and status by pushing up the price.

On average, US tuition fees had increased by 500% in real terms over the past three decades, the study found, without any link to improvements.

Of course, there is another huge difference between England's student costs and the US.

In England, fees do not have to be paid up-front. Repayments begin only when students are earning above an income threshold of 21,000 - and debts are written off after 30 years.

It's a system that has been backed by the OECD as an example of a long-term sustainable approach to university funding, which does not demand payment at the point of access.

And England is not the same as the rest of the UK, where Scotland has no fees and Wales and Northern Ireland charge about 3,800.

Pam Tatlow, chief executive of the Million+ group of new universities, says universities recognise the public concern, but the fees have replaced funding once received from government.

But she says the international examples show there is nothing inevitable about how students pay for university.

""I don't think anyone should think that the higher education funding system is set in stone.""

bbc.com,2015-05-11 00:00:00,Why you should never drink whisky on the rocks,['Brad Cohen'],"The first time I tasted Scotch whisky I was a broke student, chugging direct from a 3 bottle, lying outside my tent at the foot of Ben Nevis, Britains highest mountain. It was after a meal of tinned macaroni and cheese  hardly a sophisticated sampling considering I was sipping the worlds most venerated style of whisky. I promised myself that the next time I returned to Scotland, I would drink the best the country had to offer, in great abundance and straight from the source, no matter what it took.

It turns out, for me, all it took was a smile and a stiff right thumb.

That first Scotch whisky I drank was a blend. Of course, I didnt understand the difference between single malt and blended whisky until I returned to Scotland eight years later; most people still dont. Blended whisky, which comprises more than 80% of the market, including brands like Johnnie Walker and Dewars, is a mix of malt and grain whiskies that come from multiple distilleries. Single malt, which Scottish drinkers often refer to as malt rather than whisky (and never Scotch, like its known elsewhere around the world), is whisky created from malted barley at one distillery.

Single malts arent necessarily always better than blends, but most of Scotlands highest regarded and most expensive whiskies are the former. Blended whiskies are smoother and easier to drink; malt can be almost overwhelming in flavour, a drink most work their way up to.

The vast majority of malt comes from three major whisky-producing regions. The Highlands (roughly the northern half of Scotland) and Speyside (in the countrys northeast) are both easily accessible from major cities, and their whiskies are relatively accessible to the malt novice, characterised by smooth, floral, often delicate flavours.

Then theres Islay, the southernmost island of the Inner Hebrides, about 32km off the coast of Northern Ireland. As the crow flies, its a roughly 113km journey from Glasgow to Islay. But, unless you plan on flying into the islands tiny airport, its about 2.5 hours by car from Glasgow to the hamlet of Kennacraig, and a nearly three-hour ferry to Islay  and thats if you time the trip perfectly. Many people find Islays whisky even less accessible than the island itself.

If youre a seasoned malt drinker, chances are you have a bottle from Islay in your liquor cabinet. If, on the other hand, you tried Scotch whisky for the first time and hated it, thought it was too smoky, or tasted like medicine or ashtrays, it probably came from Islay.

Islay whiskies get their signature flavour from smoking peat  the same vegetation that Scots have long been burning to heat their homes  in order to dry the malted barley used to create whisky. The results are polarising; some purists believe the peat takes away from the true flavour of the whisky, others become addicted, perpetually searching for something peatier.

The amount of peat used varies widely. Bruichladdich is the only Islay distillery known for its non-smoked whiskies. Laphroaig, on the other end of the island and the other end of the peat spectrum, unapologetically overwhelms the palate with peat. Laphroaigs recent Opinions Welcome campaign received feedback that varied from like chewing on a well-tarred fishing boat to drinking the inside of an antique store. The opinion that resonated most with me reads, Its like fighting a peat bog monster that is on fire, but suddenly you both pause, look in one anothers eyes and kiss.

Wine drinkers like to talk about terroir: the environmental condition, geology and geography that give a wine (and the grapes that make it) its unique flavour. However, it takes a connoisseur of snobbish proportions to know a wines exact origin from a blind taste. Even an amateur drinker would probably know in one sip whether a whisky came from Islay.

Ive never tasted another drink that has more successfully bottled a place. The whisky truly tastes like Islay, distilled  of the peat bogs that cover the island, of the smoke and fire used to stay warm during a seemingly endless winter, of the salty aftertaste of the sea.

Nothing about Islay is easy. The island is rugged and tempestuous; winds gusting straight from the sea are powerful and unrelenting. Clusters of white-washed buildings make up the two main villages of Bowmore and Port Ellen; the rest of the island is mostly inhabited by sheep and birds, and largely covered in peat. The peat bogs, which take thousands of years to form and require a perfect storm of climatic conditions, spread across the island for miles.

Public transportation on the 25-mile-long island is a nightmare, and driving and visiting distilleries dont really mix. So for three days on Islay, I held out my thumb and was whisked away by kindly locals, travelling from the windswept shores to the warm and welcoming shelters of the islands eight distilleries, sampling dozens of whiskies in all their smoky glory.

For me, distilleries are near magical places, where alchemy meets science to create something far greater than the sum of its parts. They are also museums of smells, where each room has a beautiful and distinct scent.

Visiting Scottish distilleries is also an incredible deal. Between 5 and 7 generally gets you a tour of the facility and a dram (a small glass) or two of cask-strength whisky (whisky before water is added). Many distilleries also offer pricier warehouse tastings (upwards of 25 each), giving the chance to sample rare whiskies straight from the barrel, including some whiskies that are impossible to find anywhere else and others that you may never taste again.

My favourite Islay warehouse tasting was at Lagavulin, where 12 (combined with the Friends of the Classic Malts free admission) got me a sample of an eight-year old whisky still too young for bottling (the unpleasant flavour highlighted how important those years in the barrel are). I also got to try a double-matured bottle (aged 16 years in bourbon barrels before being finished for a few months in sherry casks) and a 30-year malt that normally costs more than 50 a dram in a bar, if you can find it (most single malts are aged at least 10 years, and generally get more expensive with age).

Speaking of bars, there is a certain protocol to ordering malt in Scotland. First, please dont call it Scotch. Its whisky or malt. Second, unless you want to be the subject of ridicule, dont order your malt on the rocks. Ice numbs the tongue and melts too fast. You either drink it neat or with a drop of water to open the flavours. Drinking it on the rocks is only acceptable if youre drinking a blended whisky or if its scorching outside. But the odds of the latter happening are incredibly slim. In Scotland, summer is the second most famous myth after the Loch Ness Monster.

After having been to Islay  even during Brooklyns oppressive summer heat  I still order my malt neat. I carefully pore over the bars menu, having forgotten more about whisky than most people will ever know. And even if its eight months (or more) until I find myself in Scotland again, I know it will only take one sip of that 16-year Lagavulin to transport me back to Islays windy, mountainous, peat-covered shores.",[]

bbc.com,,Peanut allergy theory backed up by new research,"['Bbc News', 'Dominic Howell']","Image copyright Thinkstock

The effects of eating peanut products as a baby to avoid the risk of allergy have been backed up by new research.

In 2015, a study claimed early exposure to peanut products could cut the risk of allergy by 80%.

Now researchers say ""long-lasting"" allergy protection can be sustained - even when the snacks are later avoided for a year.

The New England Journal of Medicine study looked at 550 children deemed prone to developing a peanut allergy.

The latest paper builds on the results of the 2015 research, which was also carried out by King's College London and marked the first time scientists were able to suggest that exposing children to small amounts of peanut snacks could stave off an allergy.

'Self-fulfilling prophecy'

The new study suggests that if a child has consumed peanut snacks within the first 11 months of life, then at the age of five they can afford to stop eating the food entirely for a year, and maintain no allergy.

Lead author Prof Gideon Lack said: ""[The research] clearly demonstrates that the majority of infants did in fact remain protected and that the protection was long-lasting.""

He said that part of the problem was that people lived in a ""culture of food fear"".

""I believe that this fear of food allergy has become a self-fulfilling prophecy, because the food is excluded from the diet and, as a result, the child fails to develop tolerance,"" he told the BBC News website.

The researchers used the same children who took part in the 2015 study - half of whom had been given peanut snacks as a baby while the remainder had been fed on a diet of breast milk alone.

Detection methods

""The study found that at six years of age, there was no statistically significant increase in allergy after 12 months of avoidance, in those who had consumed peanut during the [2015] trial,"" the authors said.

The children taking part in the study were considered prone to peanut allergy, because they had already developed eczema as a baby - an early warning sign of allergies.

Prof Lack said that further studies were needed to see if the resistance lasts for considerably longer than the 12-month abstinence period.

He said that in the UK and US combined, 20,000 babies a year are being diagnosed with peanut allergies.

He also said that between 1995 and 2005, the number of people being diagnosed had trebled, and this was not because detection methods had become any more advanced as they had remained the same.

Prof Barry Kay, from Imperial College London, said the study's results ""point the way to completely fresh thinking on the mechanisms of tolerance to allergenic foods in 'at risk' infants"".

Speaking about both pieces of research, Michael Walker, a consultant analyst and medical adviser to the government, said: ""Taken together these are reassuring findings that pave the way to stem the epidemic of peanut allergy.""",[]

Mas quando se trata de insercao no mercado de trabalho, ha pelo menos 3,3 bilhoes de mulheres a sombra dos homens. Seus direitos continuam sendo suprimidos ou negligenciados em diversas regioes do globo.

Nao ha duvida de que houve progresso nas ultimas decadas, em parte pela luta incansavel das ativistas. Leis especificas foram criadas para proteger as mulheres. Elas ganharam maior acesso a educacao. E o indice de mortalidade ao dar a luz caiu.

No entanto, alguns dos problemas que tem perseguido as mulheres por seculos permanecem.

Como atingir a igualdade de generos? Em quais areas?

No Dia Internacional das Mulheres, a BBC enumerou junto a especialistas uma lista de alguns dos direitos das mulheres que estao sob risco  e as estatisticas surpreendentes por tras deles.

Politica

O mundo da politica continua sendo predominantemente masculino.

Em 2015, a Uniao Interparlamentar (UIP), ligada a ONU, revelou que apenas 17% de todos os ministerios em todo o mundo sao chefiados por mulheres. E elas sao apenas 22% de todos os parlamentares.

MULHERES E POLITICA Posicoes de lideranca So 17% dos ministerios de todo o mundo sao chefiados por mulheres, segundo estatisticas recentes de janeiro de 2015 Em 37 paises, as mulheres totalizam menos de 10% dos parlamentares Getty

O cenario tambem e desalentador quando se analisam as posicoes de lideranca: 11 mulheres atuam como chefes de Estado e 13 como chefes de Governo, segundo um ultimo levantamento da ONU Mulheres, em agosto do ano passado.

""Nesse estagio do desenvolvimento humano, nao ha justificativa para tamanha desigualdade. Infelizmente, contudo, a vontade politica para mudar isso e inexistente na maior parte dos casos"", afirmou Anders B. Johnsson, especialista em direito internacional e ex-secretario-geral da UIP.

De certa forma, os dados melhoraram. Os numeros mais que dobraram ao longo da ultima decada, especialmente em paises que implementaram cotas para aumentar a participacao politica das mulheres: em 2015, 41 Parlamentos unicamerais ou cameras de deputados sao compostas por mais de 30% de mulheres - entre elas 11 na Africa e nove na America Latina.

Ate mesmo o mais basico dos direitos politicos para as mulheres, o voto, ainda enfrenta empecilhos: na Arabia Saudita, por exemplo, as mulheres votaram pela primeira vez na historia apenas nas eleicoes municipais de dezembro passado.

O desafio do mercado de trabalho

Outro debate acalorado esta relacionado ao mercado de trabalho: o quanto as mulheres conseguem entrar e como sao pagas uma vez que conquistam as vagas.

O relatorio mais recente lancado pela ONU sobre o assunto, ""The World's Women 2015"" (""O Mundo das Mulheres 2015, em traducao literal), aponta que, como grupo, as mulheres trabalham tanto quanto os homens, senao mais.

""Quando se leva em conta o trabalho pago e nao pago, como as tarefas domesticas e o cuidado com as criancas, as mulheres trabalham mais horas que os homens - uma media de 30 minutos a mais por dia em paises desenvolvidos e 50 minutos naqueles em desenvolvimento"", apesar que as horas gastas em trabalhos domesticos diminuiu com o passar do tempo.

Isso nao se reflete no salario que recebem - pelo contrario, se olharmos a diferenca entre os valores.

E fato conhecido que, em media, as mulheres recebem menos que os homens pelos mesmos trabalhos. E equilibrar isso teria um impacto de U$ 28 trilhoes (R$ 105 trilhoes) no PIB global ate 2025.

Esse calculo foi feito pela consultoria McKinsey Global Institute, liderada pelo cientista politico Jonathan Woetzel.

""A desigualdade de generos nao e somente uma pressao moral e social, mas tambem um desafio economico critico. Se as mulheres nao alcancarem todo o potencial economico delas, a economia global vai sofrer"", disse ele.

Especialistas apontam que tao preocupante quanto a diferenca salarial e o desequilibrio na participacao na forca de trabalho, que permanece grande especialmente no norte da Africa, no oeste e sul da Asia. Dados da Organizacao Internacional do Trabalho mostram que somente 47% das mulheres em idade ativa estao no mercado, contra 72% dos homens.

Um estudo recente feito pelo Banco Mundial em 173 paises mostra que em 155 deles ha pelo menos uma diferenca legal que restringe as oportunidades economicas as mulheres.

Como resultado, elas sao mais suscetiveis ao mercado informal de trabalho do que os homens. De acordo com a agencia da ONU para Mulheres, em 2015, mais de 80% das mulheres em trabalhos nao-agricolas no sul da Asia estavam na informalidade; na Africa Subsaariana, sao 74% e na America Latina e no Caribe, 54%.

Sozinha e segura

Em alguns paises, os niveis de violencia de genero devem ser tratados com urgencia - e nao somente nos mais pobres ou naqueles com conflitos.

O ""indice de inseguranca"", criado por pesquisadores americanos para posicionar paises de acordo com o nivel de seguranca percebido para as mulheres, revela que a ameaca ao bem-estar fisico e psicologico em nivel global e de 3.04 (em um ranking em que quatro e o pior e zero, o melhor nivel de seguranca).

""O mundo todo flutua ao redor do nivel 3, entao o cenario geral nao e bom. Vemos a inseguranca fisica das mulheres como um dos dilemas de seguranca global"", afirma Valerie Hudson, autora de Sex and World Peace (Sexo e Paz Mundial, em traducao livre).

Hudson lidera o time que esta por tras do ""indice de inseguranca"" e e membro fundadora do WomanStats Project, a base de dados mais ampla sobre direitos da mulher.

""A forma da violencia pode mudar de pais para pais. Taxas de homicidio na America Latina sao excepcionalmente altas. A violencia domestica e absolutamente penetrante na Africa Subsaariana, enquanto India, China, Vietna e outros tem riscos muito altos de selecao de genero por aborto"", disse Hudson.

DIREITOS DAS MULHERES E VIOLENCIA FISICA 3.04 e o indice global de inseguranca para as mulheres, em uma escala que vai de 0 (melhor) para 4 (pior) A maioria dos paises com indice 4 esta no Norte da Africa e na Africa Sub-Saariana, Oriente Medio e Asia Central

'Sim' consentido

Observadores tambem pressionam para uma mudanca na legislacao que vai diminuir o numero de casamentos de menores de idade ao redor do mundo.

""Se me perguntassem que mudancas especificas eu faria para melhorar a situacao da mulher, eu diria (banir) casamentos infantis. Meninas com oito anos se casam. Essa pratica condena nao so as meninas, mas tambem seus filhos a um vida de pobreza, desnutricao e niveis mais baixos de educacao"", diz Hudson.

A Unicef estima que mais de 700 milhoes de mulheres que estao vivas hoje se casaram antes de fazer 18 anos e, dessas, 250 milhoes o fizeram aos 15 anos.

A ONU chamou casamentos de menores  as vezes arranjados pelas familias, frequentemente sem consentimento  de ""violacao fundamental dos direitos humanos"" que expoe meninas ao ""risco de violencia domestica e isolacao social"".

Apesar de os numeros terem declinado fortemente desde os anos 1970, ainda quase a metade das mulheres de 20 a 24 anos no sul da Asia e 20% na Africa Subsaariana se casaram antes dos 18 anos, de acordo com o documento ""The World's Women 2015"".

As descobertas sugerem que o casamento adolescente, com permissao dos pais facilmente concedida quando necessaria, e ainda uma pratica generalizada.

O mesmo pode ser dito da poligamia, uma pratica social que muitos acreditam atrasar o desenvolvimento da mulher.

De acordo com a ultima pesquisa da ONU, a poligamia ainda era predominante em 2009: legal ou geralmente aceita em 33 paises (25 deles na Africa); aceita em parte pela populacao ou legal para algum grupo em 31 paises, 18 dos quais na Africa e 21 na Asia.

Nos olhos da lei

CASAMENTOS INFANTIS 29 paises permitem a mulheres menores de 18 anos se casar sem restricoes 52 paises permitem a mulheres com menos de 15 anos se casar sem o consentimento dos pais

Mais de 50% das mulheres entre 20 e 24 anos em Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Republica Centro-Africana, Mali, Mocambique e Nepal se casam antes dos 18 anos, segundo uma pesquisa recente

Ha outras restricoes legais sendo combatidas: do impedimento a que mulheres dirijam, na Arabia Saudita, a restricoes ao livre movimento a mulheres que nao estejam acompanhadas de seu marido ou pai.

O problema oculto, dizem especialistas, e o acesso desigual as leis familiares, que dao tratamentos diferentes para mulheres e homens nao apenas em relacao ao casamento, mas em varios aspectos da vida cotidiana.

A transmissao de bens de geracao a geracao e tambem uma das areas em que as mulheres tem menos direitos.

A Mauritania e o pais em que leis de heranca parecem ser mais desiguais, de acordo com analises do Banco Mundial. Mas outros paises, como Lesoto, tambem impedem as mulheres de ter posse de bens - elas sao obrigadas a assinar a propriedade em conjunto com homens.

O fato de elas nao serem consideradas beneficiarias ou proprietarias de terra no mesmo patamar que os homens, dizem especialistas, tira das mulheres a possibilidade de independencia financeira.

Diferenca de genero

Entao, quao ruim e o quadro geral? Uma das formas de medir o estado atual das coisas, dizem especialistas, e o indice de disparidade entre sexos que o Forum Economico Mundial vem atualizando pelos ultimos dez anos.

Apesar de essa medida nao contemplar todos os aspectos da desigualdade de genero, tem sido usada como uma forma de chamar atencao ao problema.

O Banco Mundial calculou o quanto a disparidade diminuiu desde 2006 (quando comecou a coletar informacoes), e a resposta e: nao muito.

Mesmo nas regioes que apresentam melhora nos indices, como a America do Norte e a Europa, a distancia diminuiu apenas alguns pontos percentuais.

Olhando por paises, o top 5 e dominado por nacoes nordicas, com a Islandia em primeiro lugar, seguida por Finlandia, Noruega, Suecia e Dinamarca.

No lado oposto do ranking estao Mali, Siria, Paquistao e Iemen, paises com as maiores porcentagens de desigualdade entre homens e mulheres.

DESEQUILIBRIO PATRIMONIAL 10 paises nao dao direitos iguais a homens e mulheres sobre o patrimonio Em 26 paises filhos e filhas nao tem direitos de heranca iguais

Em 27 paises viuvos e viuvas nao tem direitos iguais depois da morte do(a) parceiro(a)

1 pais concentra todas essas desigualdades: Mauritania Getty

Alem disso, seis paises viram a disparidade entre sexos aumentar desde 2006, indo contra a tendencia geral: Sri Lanka, Mali, Croacia, Macedonia e Tunisia.

""E uma via de mao dupla: o que acontece com as mulheres afeta a nacao como um todo. E ha muito o que fazer para ajudar as mulheres e tornar os paises um lugar melhor para viver"", diz Valerie Hudson.",[]

bbc.com,,US election 2016: What Canadians make of it,"['Ashley Gold', 'Bbc News']","Image copyright Reuters Image caption Canada has a new leader... the US will have one too

It was not long ago that Canadians had their own game-changing election, when Justin Trudeau swept the Liberals to an unexpected victory last October. But now they are fascinated by an election going on next door.

While many Americans have threatened to move to Canada if the candidate of their choice loses, Canadians are certainly paying attention to the US election.

This will come into sharper focus when Mr Trudeau pays a visit to the White House for talks and a state dinner with President Barack Obama this week.

So what do Canadians make of this wild, unpredictable 2016 US election season?

Is the US experiencing Trudeaumania?

Image copyright Reuters Image caption News about Mr Trump has dominated the election

Donald Trump dominates the coverage

For many Canadians, there's a simple lack of understanding about what is happening in the US, said Rafael Jacob, a researcher who focuses on American politics at the University of Quebec at Montreal.

In Canada, most media attention on Mr Trump focuses on his more outlandish comments, and there is very little discussion regarding the substance of his positions, said Mr Jacob.

""There's really an amazing level of puzzlement with what's actually happening,"" he said. ""People can't believe it.""

But most people aren't concerned about the prospect of a Trump presidency, even though some of his positions would have a direct impact on Canada, like his opposition to free trade and to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which Mr Trudeau's government has signed onto.

People realise Mr Trump isn't terribly concerned with Canada - when asked if he would build a border wall with Canada the same way he's proposed doing with Mexico, he said no.

Mr Trudeau has not taken a stand in the election either, though he has said he is watching it closely.

""I'm not going to pick a fight with Donald Trump right now. I'm not going to support him either, obviously,"" said Mr Trudeau at a recent town hall with Huffington Post Canada.

22 things that Donald Trump believes

Canadians in the middle

Politics is not as polarising in Canada. Some observers said Conservative Stephen Harper's loss to Mr Trudeau was because his positions moved too far to the right after nearly 10 years in office.

Bob Plamondon, a consultant and author who has written about Canadian history, said he puts competency above party politics.

He said he was so distressed about the state of the US election he tried to donate money to Republican candidate Marco Rubio and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.

""I was prepared to make a contribution on the basis of a safer and more prosperous world,"" he said. ""But then I looked up the laws, and because I'm Canadian I'm not allowed to donate.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Polar but not polarising

In Canadian leadership contests, not many parallels can be drawn to what's going on in the Republican party now, he said.

But Canadians are fascinated by the political drama unfolding over the border, both for their own self-interest and for the entertainment.

""It's such a remarkable, reality-TV like experience, like watching a train wreck in slow motion,"" said Mr Plamondon. ""It's theatre of the absurd. It's hard to imagine that a mature, developed democracy of the world's most important and strongest nation has deteriorated to such nonsense.""

Some Canadians do see some virtue in Donald Trump, but his level of popularity in Canada would likely be a lot lower than the faction he has ""exploited"" in the US, said Mr Plamondon.

And on the Democratic side, the reality is a bit shocking, too.

""If you told me six months ago a self-confessed Democratic socialist from a small state with a campaign further left than anything a liberal would fathom was running against Hillary Clinton... I'd be not as astonished as I am over Donald Trump's rise, but it's a close second.""

This goes on for how long?

Americans have been talking about the 2016 presidential election for years now, while 2015 saw the longest-ever Canadian campaign - only 78 days.

The length of the US election, and its cost, has raised eyebrows in Canada, with Mr Trudeau saying the US should address ""the role of campaign financing"".

In Canada, there is a cap on individual campaign donations and no corporate or union donations are permitted.

Canadians may see the long US election process as a ""spectacle"" and an interesting but drawn-out affair, said Peter Loewen, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto.

But Mr Plamondon sees some advantages to the American way.

""The reason I like it is that it engages a large swath of the population and not just a particular special interest,"" he said.

""That's a weakness in our system since party candidates at the local level in Canada are often selected simply because they can turn a few hundred people out to a meeting.""

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Trump has challenged Ted Cruz's ability to run for president since he was born in Canada

A Canuck Ted Cruz?

Canada has popped up a lot in the campaign, but not about trade or borders.

Mr Trump has repeatedly accused his Republican rival Ted Cruz of not being eligible to run for president because he was born in Canada, even threatening to sue him over it.

Mr Plamondon called the Canadian issue a ""joke"".

""Imagine if an American diplomat had a baby while overseas... Would this disqualify them from high office? I thought Donald Trump made a fool of himself as leader of the birther movement,"" he said.

Long before the 2016 election cycle, Mr Trump questioned President Obama's American-born credentials as well, demanding to see his birth certificate.

""I think it registered among the politically engaged as a nice irony that after eight years of questions about Obama's eligibility, now someone genuinely born outside America was going to be the Republican standard bearer,"" said Mr Loewen.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many doubted Rob Ford, but he became the mayor of Toronto

The Canadian Donald Trump

In 2010, Toronto had its own unlikely mayoral candidate who many laughed off - and then he won.

But Americans shouldn't take the comparison between Rob Ford and Donald Trump too far, said Mr Loewen.

""There are some similarities between Rob Ford and Donald Trump,"" he said. ""But for all of Rob Ford's foibles, he never, ever tried to appeal to base racism and ethnocentrism.""

Mr Ford admitted to smoking crack cocaine while in office - and a video later emerged which showed him threatening to kill someone.

""There was this sense that these things would be the end of Rob Ford, but they actually increased his support,"" said Mr Loewen. ""The more outrageous an act, the more popular he would become.""

In the US, the political and media class has long expected a stumble to bring the outspoken Donald Trump down, but it has not happened.

""The stakes are a bit lower in Toronto,"" said Mr Loewen. ""The mayor is not responsible for putting together a multi-trillion dollar budget.""",[]

Tim yang sudah dua kali menjuarai Piala Eropa, Benfica, mencapai babak perempat final dengan kemenangan agregat 3-1 melawan Zenit St Petersburg.

Tim Portugis tersebut memenangkan leg pertama 1-0 tapi Zenit menyamakan kedudukan di Rusia pada Rabu (09/03) atau Kamis dini hari waktu Indonesia saat Hulk mencetak skor dengan sundulan kepala pada paruh kedua.

Meski begitu, Nicolas Gaitan memasukkan bola setelah kiper tuan rumah Yuri Lodygin mendorong tembakan ke tiang gawang.

Talisca kemudian menutup kemenangan 2-1 pada malam tersebut.

Zenit, yang diasuh oleh mantan bos Chelsea dan Tottenham Andre Villas-Boas, sudah mengincar babak perempat final Liga Champions untuk pertama kalinya.

Tim Rusia tersebut berjuang untuk melumpuhkan lawan mereka sepanjang permainan, tapi sempat unggul ketika Hulk mencetak gol dengan sundulan kepala dari Yuri Zhirkov pada paruh kedua.

Dengan hanya lima menit tersisa dan skor 1-1 pada agregat, permainan tampaknya akan masuk ke waktu tambahan sebelum tendangan panjang Raal Jimanez terdorong ke tiang gawang oleh Lodygin dan pemain tengah Gaitain menyergap bola lepas tersebut dan menyundulnya ke gawang yang kosong.

Gol tersebut berarti Zenit harus mencari dua gol dan saat mereka berusaha maju, Benfica mengambil keuntungan ketika Talisca menendang setengah voli terakhir dalam permainan.",[]

bbc.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,The curse of the people who cant stop making puns,['David Robson'],"Dereks wife had put up with more than most people could stand before she finally decided to call the doctor. Almost every night, her husband would wake her up from sleep to tell her another bon mot that had just come to mind. In a bid to finally get a good nights rest, she eventually persuaded him to write them down rather than telling her directly.

Soon, he had filled 50 pages with witticisms such as:

Went to the Department of Motor Vehicles to get my drivers license. They gave me an eye exam and here is what they said: ABCDEFG, HIJKMNLOP, QRS, TUV, WXY and Z; now I know my ABCs, can I have my license please?

And

How do you cure hunger? Step away from the buffet table.

They are not exactly the wit of Oscar Wilde, yet Derek (not his real name) would erupt in fits of laughter at these small quips. (Many of the jokes were too rude to repeat in this article.)

As you can imagine, after five years of these inane gags, Dereks wife found herself at her wits end

As you can imagine, after five years of these inane gags, his wife found herself at her wits end, and she was also concerned about other strange behaviours  including shop-lifting candy from their local stores. Finally, she arranged to visit the neurologist Mario Mendez at the University of California, Los Angeles. He constantly cracked jokes during the interview, to the point of being difficult to interrupt, recalls Mendez, whose report can be found in a recent neuroscience journal.

Mendez diagnosed him with a condition called Witzelsucht (addiction to wisecracking), brought on, it seems, by two strokes, five years apart. As Dereks family found, the disorder itself is no joke, but exploring this strange compulsion may nevertheless shed light on the complex brain processing underlying a normal sense of humour.

As the doctor started manipulating the cancerous growth, his patient suddenly erupted in a manic flight of speech involving many, terrible puns

One of the first noted cases of this pathological joking emerged in the strangest circumstances by the German neurologist Otfrid Foerster in 1929. Foerster was operating on a male patient to remove a tumour. The man was still conscious  as was common practice at the time  but as he started manipulating the cancerous growth, the man suddenly erupted in a manic flight of speech, compulsively recounting pun after awful pun. That same year, the psychiatrist Abraham Brill reported coming across similar patients who would joke about anything and everything  even when they were not tied to the operating table.

Since then, many other cases have been noted. Strangely, many of the patients  including Derek  fail to respond to other peoples jokes, despite apparently finding themselves absolutely hilarious. And this may all come from very similar patterns of brain damage in the frontal lobes.

Derek, for instance, had suffered a brain haemorrhage 10 years previously, causing damage in the right frontal lobe. This in itself seemed to bring about a change in personality, leading him to compulsively search rubbish bins for objects that could be recycled  but at that point, he had the same, subdued sense of humour his wife had already known. Then, at some point later, he seems to have suffered a second stroke that damaged the left caudate nucleus. This region, lying deep in the skull, seems to act as a hub connecting the frontal lobes (involved in conscious, analytical thought) and the rest of the brain.

The result appears to be the sudden, compulsive joking that was slowly driving his wife around the bend. To understand how that particular pattern of brain damage may explain that awful sense of humour, you first need to appreciate the complex processing that lies behind a joke, such as:

How do you make a Venetian blind? Poke him in the eye.

Or this one, deemed by researchers at the University of Oxford to be one of the funniest jokes in the world:

Three guys stranded on a desert island find a magic lantern containing a genie, who grants them each one wish. The first guy wishes he was off the island and back home. The second guy wishes the same. The third guy says: Im lonely. I wish my friends were back here.

Resolving a jokes puzzle tickles the brains pleasure centres, making us laugh

Ok, maybe these quips are funnier when told by a professional comedian. But the point is that each is built around an incongruity in the punchline, and your brain must jump through a series of hoops to unpick the logic. You need to grasp the semantic associations in the word Venetian blind to grasp the double meaning, and you need to place yourself in the shoes of the people stranded on the desert island. In both cases, theres an element of surprise as you realise the twist in the tale. Resolving that puzzle tickles the brains pleasure centres, making us laugh (or at least, smile politely). The ha ha moment is not very far from the aha moment, explains Jason Warren at University College London.

This brain processing appears to occur in a network of regions around the frontal lobes  the seat of more complex, analytical thought, and the very same areas that are damaged in patients like Derek. They cannot see the relationship of the punchline to the joke, so they do not show surprise, says Mendez.

Paradoxically, this brain damage seems to disinhibit some of the signalling between those frontal lobes and the pleasure centres. So while others jokes may leave them cold, their own thoughts and feelings  stemming from any random connection or association  may end up triggering the dopamine kick as they collapse in fits of giggles.

The findings could be important in predicting the onset and progression of dementia

At least, thats the theory  and there could be some serious reasons for investigating this kind of disorder further. Warren works with frontotemporal dementia patients  a rarer form of neurodegeneration that targets people in the prime of their life. The symptoms include difficulties grasping other peoples feelings and motives. It plays havoc with their social functioning  problems that are often accompanied by an impaired (or inappropriate) sense of humour. (Indeed, another one of Mendezs Witzelsucht patients was suffering from frontotemporal dementia  though not all the patients will be compulsive jokers themselves.)

Warren recently asked these patients to judge various cartoon strips and compared the results to scans of their brains grey matter. Sure enough, many were worse at detecting more complex, multi-layered jokes  preferring instead simpler slapstick comedy (such as a drawing of a shocked woman, whose dress had been ripped off her body by a passing car.) And the harder they found the task, the more damage they showed in the humour network.

Importantly, he thinks these findings could be important in predicting the onset and progression of the disease. Doctors should take notice if a patients families have noticed a changed sense of humour  since its often the first cue that something is amiss. These changes were reported by caregivers years  maybe nine years  before the diagnosis, he says. Eventually, it might even be possible to develop a more standardised comedy test  similar to the cartoons in his own study  that helps to index changes in their social understanding and functioning.

If nothing else, it should give us a greater appreciation of the hurdles we jump through every time we find ourselves tickled by anothers wit. Humour is an extremely complex phenomenon, but we often take it for granted, says Warren. And that, at least, needs no punchline.

bbc.com,,How have we coped without biscuits?,"['Bbc News', 'Francesca Williams']","Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The shortage of biscuits like bourbons and custard creams made a nation tut and roll its eyes

Britain has been experiencing a severe shortage of biscuits - an unforeseen and yet, for some, very serious impact of the recent Cumbria floods. How have we coped?

Storms Desmond and Eva left swathes of Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire under water, causing widespread personal pain and huge economic cost.

They also submerged Carlisle's McVitie's factory ovens, halting production of custard creams, bourbons, ginger nuts and table water biscuits.

Biscuits started disappearing from shop shelves. A nation which had looked on in sympathetic disbelief began to feel the crisis bite closer to home.

Dire circumstances demand a restorative cup of tea and a cup of tea demands a biscuit.

Carlisle artist Lydia Leith, now living in London, knew something was dreadfully wrong when she came home for Christmas and the usual ""sweet sugary scented"" aroma from the factory was noticeable by its absence.

She said it was ""very upsetting"".

Image copyright Lydia Leith Image caption Lydia Leith has been forced to eat alternative brands of biscuit

""When I spoke to my friends about it they didn't believe me and they just thought it was a joke.

""But I guess if they went to the shops and tried to buy some they would realise it was a serious issue.""

Used to consuming about 34,000 tonnes of biscuits a month, the British public were suddenly facing gaps on shop shelves.

Several brands were now no longer available. Boasters, water biscuits and other McVitie's, Jacob's, Carr's and Crawford's brands had all suffered one dunking too many.

Twitter panicked. Words like ""emergency"" and ""crisis"" were used. Hoarding seemed the only sensible option.

Media caption Biscuit fans in Carlisle have been left bereft by the shortages

However, there is now some hope for the British public - production of ginger nuts has restarted and should be back on the shelves by mid March.

Convenience store Nisa's trading controller Julian Smith has apologised to ginger nut-deprived customers for the inconvenience and thanked them for their patience.

McVitie's parent company, United Biscuits, told him the affected lines would be ""resurrected in stages"" over March and April.

It said previously the complete resumption of production was its ""absolute priority"".

Sainsbury's, which put signs up in its stores to apologise for supply shortages, has welcomed the good ginger nut news.

Image copyright Dave Maddocks Image caption Twitter user Dave Maddocks captured evidence of the harsh reality

Asda however, says the situation has not had a ""drastic effect"". Perhaps their customers are more stoical - or their stockpiles larger.

There have been 400 people working to get the factory fully up and running, among them suppliers and contractors, not just members of the 640-strong workforce.

Gold Bars are reportedly already back in production; water biscuits are more tricky. Made in traditional brick ovens on the same Caldewgate site they have occupied since 1837, they could not be made anywhere else.

And, since production is normally round the clock anyway, it is hard to see how it could be increased.

The crackers, it is being suggested, will not be back in shops until April. Fans will be leaving the cheese in the fridge a little while longer.

Carr's of Carlisle A water biscuit history 1831 Jonathan Dodgson Carr starts a bakery business in Carlisle 1837 The firm moves to Caldewgate, near the River Caldew

1841 Queen Victoria grants a royal warrant - the first for a biscuit maker

Late 19th century The firm starts binding the dry ingredients with water instead of fat to keep the biscuits fresh on long sea journeys

2011 Carlisle City Council permits the firm to use the authority's coat of arms on its Carr's packaging Thinkstock

It must be remembered, the cost of the flooding has been far greater than just a nation facing a diminished afternoon treat.

Laurence Gibbons, from the food and drink trade publication Food Manufacture, believes United Biscuits is looking at a 50m insurance claim.

Although it is a ""pretty big player in the biscuit market"" its other factories are ""all tailored towards certain products"" and could not pick up the slack without a knock-on effect on other brands, he says.

After the 2005 floods, the McVitie's factory got production going again with the help of a 1m government grant.

There is no suggestion a similar payment is in the offing this time, though businesses can bid for 5,000 from a 50m fund pledged by the chancellor.

The company is said to be picking the brains of other firms, in the UK and abroad, to find out how to improve flood protection in the future.

Hopefully, panic-buying and biscuit hoarding will not be necessary next winter but it is worth remembering, just in case, that other kinds of biscuits are available.

As Ms Leith points out, the motto on Carr's water biscuits reads: ""Be just and fear not"".

Good advice in a biscuit crisis.

Rin Tin Tin membintangi 27 film, empat di antaranya beredar di tahun 1929. Tetapi Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences yang baru saja dibentuk oleh pimpinan MGM, Louis B Mayer, memutuskan memberikan seekor anjing patung berlapis emas setinggi 34,3 cm legendaris berbentuk ksatria Abad Pertengahan Art Deco yang memegang pedang perang salib dan berdiri di atas gulungan film, akan memberikan citra yang salah.

Image copyright Rex Image caption Patung Oscar seberat 3,6 kg dan mulai Academy Awards 2016 akan dibuat perusahaan Polich Tallix di New York.

Keputusan itu akan menciptakan preseden yang eksentrik dan penuh tanda tanya. Jadi meskipun Rin Tin Tin mendapatkan suara terbanyak saat pemilihan suara aktor terbaik dalam tahap pertama, rumor yang telah dipastikan penulis New Yorker, Susan Orlean dalam biografi bintang anjing tersebut, Academy melakukan pemungutan suara putaran kedua dengan calon hanya aktor manusia.

Sejak saat itu, Oscar mengundang kontroversi. Walt Disney menerima 26 piala, yang terbanyak sampai sejauh ini, sementara Alfred Hitchcock tidak pernah diakui, kecuali lewat patung kehormatan. Saat menjadi pembawa acara salah satu Academy Award, Bob Hope mengatakan,"" Kalau masih ada patung yang tersisa, kita akan mengirimnya ke Walt Disney"".

Apapun politik di dalam Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, tidak diragukan lagi bahwa Oscar diinginkan banyak orang. Poster Academy Award tahun ini memperlihatkan garis emas patung dari latar belakang sama sekali hitam. ""Kita semua bermimpi dalam warna emas"", demikian tertulis.

Model Oscar

Image caption Dinamakan Academy Award of Merit, semua orang di Hollywood mengenalnya sebagai Oscar.

Patung ini tidak terlalu banyak berubah sejak upacara pertama pada tahun 1929 yang dipimpin Douglas Fairbanks, 'Raja Hollywood' dan presiden pertama Academy di hotel gaya penjajahan Spanyol, Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. Ikon emas tersebut dirancang pada secarik kertas oleh Cedric Gibbons, direktur seni MGM dan dijadikan patung oleh seniman LA, George Stanley.

Gibbons kelahiran Irlandia adalah salah satu penata gaya paling berpengaruh di Hollywood. Anak seorang arsitek, dia kemungkinan satu-satunya perancang Hollywood yang mengunjungi Paris pada tahun 1925 untuk mendatangi pusat Art Deco, Expositions des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes.

Setelah kembali ke Hollywood, Gibbons membuat 'Big White Set' yang menjadi karakteristik kebanyakan produksi gaya Art Deco Hollywood saat itu, yang dipandang sesuai dengan drama musik, lagu dan tarian. Dia juga merancang rumah Art Deco-nya, dengan arsitek Douglas Honnold, di Santa Monica Hills dengan dekorasi Big White Set. Tempat tersebut selesai dibuat pada tahun 1930 bertepatan dengan pernikahannya dengan Dolores del Rioa, bintang film bisu asal Meksiko yang glamour. Kegemaran Gibbons terhadap Art Deco terus hidup setiap tahun ketika patung Oscar muncul di Academy Awards.

Meskipun model tidak dipakai dalam proses rancangan, Dolores del Rio menyatakan temannya asal Meksiko, Emilio Fernandez, figuran Hollywood berusia 20-an saat itu, berpose telanjang untuk George Stanley. Meskipun hal ini menambah bumbu Oscar, cerita ini kemungkinan mempengaruhi karier Fernandez sebagai aktor dan sutradara. Dia kemudian memenangkan penghargaan pertama Palme dOr pada tahun 1946 lewat filmnya Maria Candeleria. Patung ini sangat dibuat-buat, bentuknya sangat abstrak, sehingga semua pemuda yang fit tubuhnya dapat menjadi modelnya.

Image copyright Getty Image caption Pemenang pertama Oscar sebenarnya adalah Rin Tin Tin, anjing German Shepherd.

Jika cerita Emilio Fernandez diragukan kebenarannya, nama Oscar masihlah sebuah teka-teki. Resminya, patung tersebut dinamakan Academy Award of Merit, tetapi semua orang di Hollywood mengenalnya sebagai Oscar sejak tahun 1934. Academy sendiri menggunakan nama itu pada tahun 1939. Cerita yang paling masuk akal adalah ketika pustakawan Academy, Margaret Herrick, melihat patung untuk pertama kalinya, dia mengatakannya mirip pamannya Oscar. Ada juga cerita lain tentang nama patung itu, termasuk rumor Bette Davis menamakannya berdasar suami pertamanya, Harmon Oscar Nelson, tetapi apapun asalnya, nama itu terus melekat.

Pria emas kecil

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Walt Disney memenangkan Oscar terbanyak dalam sejarah, 26 piala, perancang kostum Edith Head memegang rekor terbanyak untuk wanita dengan delapan piala.

Oscar aslinya terbuat dari tembaga padat berlapis emas, dibuat CW Shumway & Sons Foundry di Batavia, Illinois. Pada pertengahan tahun 1930-an, tembaga diubah menjadi logam Britannia dicampur tembaga, perak nikel, dilapis emas murni 24 karat. Oscar bersinar indah sejak saat itu untuk kamera dan meja serta lemari pemenangnya. Sejak tahun 1982, pembuatnya adalah RS Owens & Company, Chicago.

Perubahan berarti rancangannya terjadi pada tahun 1939 ketika Shirley Temple, 10 tahun, memberikan Piala Kehormatan kedua bagi Walt Disney. Piala Oscar standar berdiri bersama-sama patung tujuh orang kerdil, sebuah penghormatan bagi Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs buatan Disney pada tahun 1937.

Meskipun demikian dari tahun 1942 dan 1945, ketika semua logam langka, Oscar dibuat dari plester yang dicat, sama seperti patung keagamaan. Para penerimanya kemudian dapat menggantinya dengan emas begitu perang berakhir.

Image copyright Disney Enterprises Image caption Shirley Temple, 10 tahun, memberikan Piala Kehormatan kedua bagi Walt Disney untuk Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs dalam bentuk tujuh Oscar kecil.

Yang tidak pernah dianggap ringan adalah penjualan Oscar. Sejak tahun 1950, baik penerima maupun pewarisnya, jika ingin menjualnya, pertama-tama harus menawarkannya ke Academy dengan harga US$1 atau Rp13.000. Beberapa pemilik Oscar menemukan celah yang memungkinkan mereka menjual patung itu. Tahun 2011, Beatrice Welles, anak perempuan Orson Welles, melelang Oscar yang dimenangkan ayahnya pada tahun 1942 lewat film Citizen Kane (naskah asli terbaik). Patung itu laku terlelang US$861.542 atau Rp1,1 miliar. Apakah Oscar lainnya lebih besar nilainya?

Oscar sebenarnya tidak ternilai. Ikon Hollywood ini dipandang sebagai patung para santo di gereja atau peringatan keagamaan. Dan benar atau tidak, Emil Jannings dilaporkan membawa Oscarnya seperti benda keagamaan saat dia mendekati pasukan Sekutu yang bergerak maju di Jerman pada akhir Perang Dunia Kedua. ""Saya punya Oscar!"" teriaknya, dengan harapan dia akan mendapatkan kemudahan. Jannings selamat, tetapi harus melewati proses 'pencucian' anggota Nazi. Film perang terakhirnya yang tidak selesai dibuat berjudul Wo ist Herr Belling?, sebuah komedi ringan tentang berbagai hal. Film itu mulai diambil gambarnya pada 12 Desember 1944, empat hari sebelum Hitler melancarkan Ardennes Offensive, serangan besar-besaran terakhir Jerman sebelum hancurnya Reich.

Bisa dibilang tidak berubah, patung Oscar tetap berkilau selama puluhan tahun di Hollywood maupun di luarnya. Rancangan mengundang banyak tanya yang sangat ingin dimiliki banyak orang tersebut, tetap menjadi barang suci Hollywood.",[]

Organisasi Kesehatan Dunia (WHO) memperingatkan pengembangan vaksin Zika mungkin terlambat untuk mengatasi wabah penyakit tersebut di kawasan Amerika Latin.

Asisten direktur jenderal WHO, Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, mengatakan bahkan pengembangan vaksin eksperimental paling maju sekali pun masih perlu waktu beberapa bulan, sebelum bisa diujicobakan ke manusia.

""Pengembangan vaksin (Zika) masih dalam tahap yang sangat awal. Versi paling maju masih perlu pengembangan selama beberapa bulan lagi, sebelum bisa diujicobakan ke manusia,"" kata Dr Kieny.

Ia menyampaikan pernyataan ini usai mengikuti pertemuan dengan para pakar Zika, di Jenewa, Swiss, hari Rabu (09/03).

Meski demikian Dr Kieny mengatakan pengembangan vaksin seperti ini tetap penting, terutama vaksin bagi wanita hamil dan wanita yang berencana ingin segera punya anak.

Virus Zika, yang disebarkan oleh nyamuk diyakini menjadi penyebab lahirnya bayi-bayi yang cacat dan ditandai dengan ukuran kepala yang lebih kecil dari bayi-bayi normal.

Berbagai upaya telah ditempuh oleh sejumlah negara di kawasan Amerika Latin, di antaranya penyemprotan nyamuk dengan insektisida, namun WHO mengatakan belum ada bukti kuat bahwa penyemprotan efektif dalam menghentikan penyebaran Zika.

Klub Liga Primer sepakat untuk membatasi harga tiket pertandingan tandang pada 30 atau sekitar Rp600.000 untuk tiga musim ke depan.

Biaya menonton pertandingan bola menjadi topik hangat perdebatan, dengan pendukung Liverpool melakukan protes terhadap rencana kenaikan dalam harga tiket musiman.

Kini, 20 klub teratas sudah ""secara bulat sepakat"" bahwa harus ada upaya lebih membantu penggemar yang berkunjung.

Pembatasan harga tiket bertandang 30 akan diperkenalkan musim depan.

Dalam pernyataan, Liga Primer mengatakan bahwa penggemar yang berkunjung ""penting untuk suasana pertandingan"" dan membantu liga menjadi unik.

Mereka mengakui bahwa penonton pertandingan tandang sering harus membayar biaya perjalanan selain juga tiket pertandingan.

Delapan dari 18 klub Liga Primer yang berpartisipasi dalam penelitian Price of Football BBC sudah menawarkan tiket pertandingan tandang dengan harga kurang dari 30.

Namun penelitian yang diterbitkan Oktober lalu itu juga menemukan bahwa sembilan klub memasang harga lebih dari 30 untuk tiket termurah.

Apakah 30 sesuai keinginan penggemar?

Federasi Suporter Sepak Bola, FSF, sudah sejak lama mengampanyekan tiket yang lebih murah dan menginginkan harga untuk penonton pertandingan tandang dibatasi pada 20.

Direktur komunikasi FSF Michael Brunskill menyambut pengumuman Rabu itu (09/03) sebagai ""kabar baik bagi kelompok suporter di seluruh negeri"".

Kelompok pendukung Liverpool Spirit of Shankly, yang membantu memimpin protes terhadap rencana kenaikan harga di Anfield awal musim ini, mengatakan bahwa pembatasan harga tiket, ""adalah langkah yang baik menuju arah yang tepat"".

Image copyright Getty Image caption Penggemar Liverpool melakukan walkout terkait tiket pertandingan dan mendapat apa yang mereka inginkan.

Direktur eksekutif Everton Robert Elstone mengatakan bahwa langkah tersebut ""sangat tepat untuk suporter yang datang ke pertandingan tandang dan bagi Liga Primer"".

Direktur eksekutif Stoke juga menambahkan, ""Suporter (pertandingan tandang) membayar biaya yang tak seimbang untuk mengikuti tim mereka dari segi harga tiket dan perjalanan dan kami senang bahwa inisiatif 30 sudah diterapkan.""

Pengumuman pembatasan harga tiket ini dilakukan pada hari yang sama dengan Arsenal dan Tottenham mengumumkan pengurangan harga tiket untuk penonton kandang.

Kevin Miles, direktur eksekutif FSF mengatakan, organisasinya ""sangat senang bahwa suara penggemar sudah didengar"".

Dia juga menambahkan, ""Harga tiket maksimum 30 akan menghemat banyak uang bagi banyak penggemar, dan jumlah itu akan mempengaruhi banyak orang apakah mereka akan menonton pertandingan tandang atau tidak.""",[]

La Gabriela Mistral que se ensena en Chile es la madre y maestra, la poeta que invita: ""Dame la mano y danzaremos; dame la mano y me amaras"".

En las plazas y hasta el billete de 5.000 pesos chilenos Mistral es la mujer con los labios apretados y el ceno fruncido, vistiendo un traje de dos piezas y el pelo recogido en un mono.

Y en el ambito literario, los mistralistas tradicionales han llegado a llamarle ""la divina"" o ""la santa"", alimentando esta imagen unidimensional y distante de la escritora, diplomatica e intelectual mas importante de la historia de Chile.

Es cierto que la autora nacida en 1889 en la comuna de Vicuna, al noreste de Chile, defendio los derechos de los ninos y la importancia de la educacion, escribio poesia sobre la infancia, el amor maternal y la naturaleza. Pero tambien creo textos de una pasion ferviente, incluso de erotismo entre mujeres.

En la intimidad, en sus cartas, videos y audios personales, Gabriela Mistral demuestra haber sido una persona mas compleja de lo que indica el retrato oficial.

Secreto a voces

La primera persona de America Latina en ganar el premio Nobel de Literatura y la unica mujer de la region que ha conseguido dicha distincion hasta el dia de hoy vivio en una epoca muy conservadora.

Mistral ""reunia todas las condiciones para ser discriminada"", le dice a BBC Mundo Maria Elena Wood, documentalista que ha estudiado principalmente los ultimos anos de vida de la poeta, desde que recibio el Nobel en 1945 hasta su muerte, en 1957.

Image copyright Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Chile Image caption Gabriela Mistral y Doris Dana de visita en Mexico en 1949.

En primer lugar era mujer, un factor de discriminacion socioeconomico hasta la actualidad. No en vano este martes, en el que se celebra el Dia Internacional de la Mujer, el lema es ""Por un planeta 50-50 en 2030: Demos el paso para la igualdad de genero"".

Wood explica que, ademas, Mistral provenia de una familia pobre del interior chileno, no tenia padre, era mas alta de lo comun y de rasgos indigenas, y tenia una personalidad conflictiva y fuerte. Por si todo esto fuera poco, dice, era lesbiana.

En 2010 Wood estreno ""Locas mujeres"", un documental sobre la relacion romantica entre Mistral y la estadounidense Doris Dana, basandose en 40.000 documentos personales de la escritora chilena.

Su documental revelo lo que hasta entonces era un secreto a voces: Dana no era su asistente o secretaria, como se ha repetido hasta el cansancio en las biografias de la autora de ""Los sonetos de la muerte"" y ""Desolacion"". Dana era su pareja.

Esto, segun Wood, genero un conflicto en el mundo mistraliano tradicional. ""La preferian loca que lesbiana"", dice la documentalista.

La teoria de que Mistral ""enloquecio"" surge de la profunda tristeza y soledad que sintio la escritora tras el suicidio en 1943 a los 17 anos de su sobrino, Juan Miguel Godoy, a quien ella crio como hijo y llamaba carinosamente Yin Yin.

""Mi querida maestra""

Por sus tareas como escritora, intelectual y consul chilena, Mistral pasaba mas tiempo afuera de su pais que adentro. En 1946, tras ganar el Nobel, fue invitada a dictar una conferencia en la Universidad de Columbia, en Nueva York.

Dana estaba entre el publico.

Image copyright Gabriela Mistral Foundation Image caption En 1943, su hijo adoptivo Yin Yin se suicido a los 17 anos, lo que le genero una profunda tristeza.

""Mi querida maestra"", dice la primera carta que Dana le escribio a Mistral, dos anos despues de aquella conferencia. ""En la profunda ternura contemplativa y la fuerza de sus obras, el mundo ha encontrado en usted una maestra de sentido y una llama viva del arte mas puro"".

Con el escritor Thomas Mann como principal punto en comun, ambas mujeres empezaron una relacion primero profesional y luego sentimental, segun se desprende de su apasionado intercambio epistolar publicado en 2012 por Penguin Random House bajo el titulo ""Nina errante"".

Cuando Dana se carteo por primera vez con Mistral tenia 28 anos y estaba dando sus primeros pasos como escritora. La chilena era una autora consagrada de 60 anos, que ya empezaba a tener problemas de salud.

""Tu no me conoces todavia bien, mi amor. Tu ignoras la profundidad de mi vinculo contigo. Dame tiempo, damelo, para hacerte un poco feliz"", dice una de las cartas de Mistral a Dana.

""Yo me pongo en el viento y en la lluvia tierna, para que estos, viento y lluvia, puedan abrazarte y besarte para mi"", le responde la estadounidense, que luego se convertiria en la albacea de los bienes materiales e intelectuales de Mistral.

Image copyright Gabriela Mistral Foundation Image caption En diciembre de 2015 se cumplieron 70 anos de que Mistral recibiera el premio Nobel de Literatura.

Su relacion epistolar abarca 9 anos e incluye fragmentos de amor y pasion como estos, pero tambien hay dolor, reproches y pormenores de la vida cotidiana.

Negado hasta la muerte

Mistral nunca tuvo interes de que se conociera su vida intima. Era discreta, como indicaba la etiqueta de la epoca. Tuvo numerosas secretarias, mujeres educadas que la ayudaban en lo domestico y financiero, pero tambien con el caos de sus poemas y textos escritos por doquier en pequenos papeles.

De hecho, fue la propia Mistral quien inicio el rumor de que Dana era su asistente.

Dana, en cambio, nego directamente cualquier vinculo romantico entre ellas hasta la fecha de su muerte, en 2006. Sin embargo, como escribio en el epilogo de ""Nina errante"" su sobrina Doris Atkinson, la estadounidense ""no hizo esfuerzo alguno por restringir el uso de las cartas ni dejo instrucciones al respecto"".

Image copyright Locas Mujeres Image caption El documental ""Locas mujeres"", de Maria Elena Wood, se estreno en Chile en 2010.

Solo habia indicado que la totalidad del legado de la poeta debia entregarse a ""instituciones apropiadas"".

Atkinson decidio que dichas instituciones estaban en el Chile natal de Mistral y por eso en 2007 entrego al estado 40.000 manuscritos, cartas, fotografias y objetos, entre otras pertenencias.

Entre el pudor y la censura

A fines del ano pasado, el programa periodistico ""Chile en Llamas"" emitio en dicho pais un capitulo llamado ""Censura por razones de genero"", que dedicaba 10 minutos a Mistral.

Alli, el escritor Juan Pablo Sutherland cuenta que en 2002 intento incluir tres poemas de Mistral en la compilacion ""A corazon abierto. Geografia literaria de la homosexualidad en Chile"", de editorial Sudamericana. Sin embargo, la Fundacion Premio Nobel Gabriela Mistral no lo permitio.

""Es una censura que esta ordenandole a la gente como leer los textos y eso lo encuentro mas feroz"", dice Sutherland.

Image copyright Gabriela Mistral Foundation Image caption Gabriela Mistral salio por primera vez de Chile por invitacion del gobierno mexicano en 1922.

Una decada y media despues, Jaime Quezada, escritor y director de la Fundacion Premio Nobel Gabriela Mistral, le dice a BBC Mundo: ""Incluso todavia no me atreveria a decir enfaticamente que era lesbiana"".

En su opinion, afirmarlo seria un ""atrevimiento"" y denotaria ""cierta irresponsabilidad"".

Por eso el ano pasado Quezada critico publicamente a la presidenta de Chile, Michelle Bachelet, cuando ella cito una carta de Mistral a Dana en el contexto de la promulgacion de la ley de matrimonio gay en dicho pais.

""Nuestra Gabriela Mistral escribio a su querida Doris Dana: 'Hay que cuidar esto Doris, es una cosa delicada el amor'. Y lo recuerdo hoy porque a traves de esta ley lo que hacemos es reconocer desde el Estado el cuidado de las parejas y de las familias y dar un soporte material y juridico a esa vinculacion nacida en el amor"", dijo entonces Bachelet.

La Gabriela Mistral Foundation tiene una postura mas tajante. ""Como fundacion nos dedicamos unicamente a su legado"", dice Gloria Garafulich-Grabois, integrante de la junta directiva de la institucion con sede en Nueva York.

""La importancia que tiene es por su obra literaria"", agrega Garafulich-Grabois. ""La respetamos, pero no tocamos ese tema"".

El problema de infantilizar a Mistral

En 2012, Pedro Pablo Zegers, editor de ""Nina errante"", dijo al presentar el libro que su intencion era bajar a Mistral del pedestal en el que ha estado durante 50 anos, para asi acercarla a la gente e incitar una lectura menos reduccionista de la autora.

Image caption El billete de 5.000 pesos chilenos tiene a Gabriela Mistral.

En este sentido, Quezada reconoce el problema de que ""se sigue ensenando a Mistral como la autora de poemas escolares"". La ternura de su poesia prevalece frente a la amplitud plural de su trabajo intelectual, afirma.

Por su parte, Wood cuenta que en su momento, durante la realizacion de ""Locas mujeres"", se pregunto si debia o no dar a conocer la vida intima de Mistral. ""El documental no admite dudas porque incluye una grabacion de ellas diciendo que estan juntas y se aman"", dice.

La falta de conocimiento de ""la verdadera artista"" fue lo que la llevo a seguir con el proyecto audiovisual: ""Es imposible entender la pasion de su poesia sin conocer las fuerzas internas que la movian"".",[]

bbc.com,,EU referendum: Palace complains over Queen 'Brexit' story,[],"Image copyright PA Image caption Nick Clegg called the Sun's story ""nonsense""

Buckingham Palace has complained to the press watchdog over the Sun newspaper's article claiming the Queen backed ""Brexit"" from the European Union.

The Sun quotes anonymous sources, one of whom claims to have witnessed a ""bust-up"" between the Queen and pro-EU former Deputy PM Nick Clegg in 2011.

The palace insisted the Queen was ""politically neutral"" while Mr Clegg called the story ""nonsense"".

But the Sun said it stood by its story and would defend itself ""vigorously"".

All you need to know about the EU referendum

UK and the EU - better off out or in?

Under the headline, ""Queen backs Brexit"", the Sun said the Queen's exchange with Mr Clegg at a lunch in 2011 left ""no room for doubt about her passionate feelings over Europe"".

It said her ""reprimand"" of Mr Clegg ""went on for some time and stunned other guests"".

The paper says the Queen also revealed her feelings about Europe during a separate conversation with MPs at Buckingham Palace ""a few years ago"".

It claims the Queen told them: ""I don't understand Europe"" - words an unnamed parliamentary source says she spoke with ""venom and emotion"".

Following the complaint the newspaper said: ""The Sun stands by its story, which was based upon two impeccable sources and presented in a robust, accessible fashion.

""The Sun will defend this complaint vigorously.""

Analysis

Image copyright EPA

By Peter Hunt, BBC Royal correspondent

It is unusual for the Queen to take action against a newspaper.

It is a sign of the depth of regal displeasure.

It is the Sun headline, ""Queen Backs Brexit"" which is both toxic and very troubling to an institution which prides itself on remaining above the political fray.

But the course of action the palace has now embarked upon brings with it risks. It's a far cry from the ""never complain, never explain"" mantra once deployed by officials in the past.

The letter to the press watchdog ensures that the Sun story continues to be debated.

And there continues to be a focus on what the Queen chose very deliberately to do four days before the Scottish referendum.

When she told a well-wisher in 2014 ""I hope people will think very carefully about the future"", it was interpreted as support for Scotland remaining within the UK.

It was a planned remark the Queen and her senior advisers may come to regret.

Read more from Peter

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ""We can confirm that we have this morning written to the chairman of the Independent Press Standards Organisation to register a complaint about the front page story in today's Sun newspaper.

""The complaint relates to Clause One of the Editors' Code of Practice.""

The Editors' Code of Practice is regulated by the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO). Clause One refers to accuracy, saying ""the Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text"".

It also states ""while free to editorialise and campaign, the Press must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact"".

'Politically impartial'

The Sun's political editor Tom Newton Dunn wrote that the paper would not have reported the Queen's remarks ""had they not come from two different and impeccably placed sources"".

He says the Queen must remain ""above the fray"" of political issues, but added: ""If she has a view on Brexit, don't voters have a right to know what it is?""

Professor Vernon Bogdanor, constitutional expert at Kings College London, told the Press Association it was ""absurd"" that the Queen would break from her tradition of political impartiality after decades as monarch.

""I'm very dubious. The Queen speaks and acts on the advice of ministers,"" Prof Bogdanor said. ""What she said on the Scottish referendum was that people should think carefully before they vote - and that's a very sensible comment, I would have thought.""",[]

bbc.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,The worlds smallest kingdom,['Eliot Stein'],"Just south of Sardinia's world-famous Costa Smeralda, the lonely island of Tavolara rises wildly from the cerulean sea like a jagged mountain. There are no roads or hotels, and the only inhabitable stretch is a white-sand tongue thats best measured from end to end in steps.

This is where I found Antonio Bertoleoni as our ferry sputtered to a float. Better known as ""Tonino"", the 83-year-old former fisherman owns Tavolaras only restaurant and is the reigning ruler of the island, which happens to be the smallest inhabited kingdom in the world. For the past 22 years, Tonino has commanded this 5sqkm mini-monarchy in shorts and sandals.

Im probably the worlds most ordinary king.

Im probably the worlds most ordinary king, Tonino said, burying his feet in the sand and looking toward his restaurant. The only privilege I enjoy is free meals.

The Kingdom of Tavolara is currently celebrating its 180th anniversary and actually predates Italy by 25 years. Forming your own island nation might sound like the kind of thing youd dream up when youre marooned in the Mediterranean, but the story began in 1807 when Toninos great-great-grandfather, Giuseppe Bertoleoni, became the then uninhabited islands first settler. Described as a half shepherd, half pirate in the book Tavolara, Island of the Kings, the Genovese immigrant had recently married two sisters and was seeking a safe haven to escape his bigamy charge.

Giuseppe and his small harem soon realised that they were sharing their island paradise with a rare species of wild goats whose teeth were dyed a golden-yellow colour by the seaweed and lichen they ate. Word of the gilt-toothed goats eventually spread to Sardinias ruler, Carlo Alberto, who eagerly travelled to Tavolara to hunt the animals in 1836. Giuseppes 24-year-old son, Paolo, guided the hunting excursions.

When he landed, Carlo Alberto introduced himself by saying, Im Carlo Alberto, the King of Sardinia, Tonino said. And so my great-grandfather replied, Well, Im Paolo, the King of Tavolara.

After killing several goats and feasting for three days at Paolos home, Carlo Alberto was so delighted that he said, Paolo, you really are the King of Tavolara! before sailing off, according to Tonino. Joking or not, Carlo Alberto later confirmed that the far-flung island had never officially been part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, and he sent Paolo a scroll from Carlo Albertos royal family, the House of Savoy, that certified the monarchys status.

Paolo promptly created the Bertoleoni coat of arms and painted it on the wall of his home. He also drew a royal family tree and built a cemetery on the island for himself and his descendants. When he died, he insisted on being buried with a crown cemented atop his tombstone  something he never wore while alive.

In the years that followed, news of the islands sovereignty spread beyond the Mediterranean, and tiny Tavolara even formed a handful of political allies.Giuseppe Garibaldi, one of Italys founding fathers, soon became a trusted advisor of the Bertoleoni family; and the King of Sardinia at the time, Vittorio Emanuele II, went so far as to sign a peace treaty with the stamp-sized islands 33 residents in 1903.

While collecting photographs of world leaders, Queen Victoria commissioned a British naval vessel to stop by the island so that officers could photograph Tavolaras royal family. For years, the gold-framed photo was displayed in Buckingham Palace with the caption Worlds Smallest Kingdom. Today, a giant copy of it hangs in Toninos restaurant, which is appropriately called The King of Tavolara and adorned with the royal crest that King Paolo I first designed.

After 126 years, the installation of a NATO base in 1962 effectively ended the kingdoms independence, and made a quarter of the island off-limits to its handful of residents. Yet, like San Marino, Tavolara has never been formally annexed into modern Italy, making Tonino the fifth king in a kingdom that the world no longer recognises.

These days, when hes not fishing for squid or gardening outside his squat bungalow, his majesty lords over Tavolara's 11 part-time residents, 100 nimble mountain goats and a few species of endangered falcons that live atop the islands 565m limestone peak. For the past 40 years, Tonino has been personally escorting visitors to his familys island palace  first by rowboat, and now via a 25-minute ferry that he operates from Porto San Paolo.

My family may have had a beautiful past, Tonino said in a soft voice, but we work hard and live simply, just like everybody else.

In fact, running the kingdom is very much a family business. While the king and his nephew, Nicola, captain the summer ferry, the prince and princess in waiting, Giuseppe and Loredana, now run the beachside restaurant. Giuseppes nephew, Antonio, wakes up early to go fishing every morning and supplies most of the clams, lobster and fish that fly out of the kitchen each afternoon and evening.

Thanks to a wave of tourism to the island, the kingdoms GDP has been strong recently. Ironically, Tavolara is now the crown jewel in a protected Italian national marine reserve that has one of the highest levels of biomass in the Mediterranean. As a result, the island has quickly become one of the top diving destinations in Italy, with visitors flocking to swim with tortoises, sperm whales and basking sharks before coming up for air at the al fresco restaurant.

For me, its a privilege just to live here. Who needs a crown when you have a palace.

While Tonino still likes to greet guests as they come from the dock, his favourite part of the day is before the swell of sun worshippers and scuba enthusiasts descend on his empire. Just after dawn, he likes to walk past Tavolaras handful of sunset-coloured homes and along a dusty path to visit the royal cemetery. Since King Paolo I passed in 1886, the plot has grown to hold every noble member of the kingdom  most recently Toninos wife, Queen Pompea, who passed away several years ago.

I like to bring her plastic flowers, Tonino said. If I brought her fresh ones, the goats would just eat them.

Like most of the Bertoleonis who came before him and the prince who will one day succeed him, Tonino is technically an Italian citizen. He once vowed to make an appeal to Vittorio Emanuele IV, the son of the last King of Italy and the self-proclaimed Duke of Savoy, for the royal family to once again recognise the Kingdom of Tavolara, but then had a change of heart.

For me, its a privilege just to live here, Tonino said, staring out past the dock at his emerald empire. Who needs a crown when you have a palace?

bbc.com,,Intriguing history of 'Paris siege' letter,"['Bbc News', 'Clea Caulcutt']","Image copyright National Archives of Australia Image caption National Archives of Australia said there was no record of how the ""intriguing piece of history"" arrived there

When A Mesnier wrote to his mother in December 1870, Paris was under siege. The Prussians had surrounded the capital, food supplies were running low and temperatures had dropped below freezing.

Mr Mesnier wrote of his hopes for victory and his frustration at being unable to enlist. The letter was flown out of Paris in a ""ballon monte"", a hot air balloon, the only way to communicate with the rest of France.

Recently the letter has inexplicably resurfaced in Australia. But how it got there remained the big question.

When Emmanuel Hamel, a civil servant in Normandy, read about the letter in a local newspaper, he immediately set out on his investigation.

The first clue, he said, was the mother's name Mesnier and the address in Pont-Audemer, Normandy. Mr Hamel calculated Mrs Mesnier's likely date of death and found her death certificate in local archives. Her full name was Julie Stephanie Mesnier.

But it was the next discovery that gave Mr Hamel a frisson.

Trawling through archives, he stumbled upon the marriage certificate of Mrs Mesnier's son Pierre Alexandre with a woman in Paris.

""I started getting palpitations, I knew I had found him,"" he said. ""The signature on the marriage certificate matched the signature on the letter!""

Image copyright National Archives of Australia and Paris Archives Image caption Mr Hamel discovered that signatures on marriage certificate and letter matched

So A Mesnier, the author of the letter, was in fact Pierre Alexandre Mesnier, a lawyer at the court of Napoleon the Third.

""It is wonderful to have a sense of substance, to know that Mr Mesnier was working at the imperial court, hence the fervour and engagement with Paris,"" says Louise Doyle, assistant director general at Australia's National Archives, who has been in touch with Mr Hamel about his discoveries.

But there was more to come.

""In the letter, the author mentioned a man called Jules who had not written to him for a long time,"" Mr Hamel said.

""I assumed Jules was a close relative because there was no surname."" And indeed the name Jules Mesnier also appears on Alexandre's wedding certificate as his witness and brother.

Image copyright National Archives of Australia Image caption Mr Mesnier tells his mother in the letter that ""the only thing I have fired at is the practice target""

Jules Mesnier managed a Swansea-based shipping company called Poingdestre et Mesnier. He also founded France's first phosphate mining company, Phosphate de l'Oceanie, which traded with islands across the Pacific Ocean.

Quite conceivably his job would have taken him to Australia and the Pacific.

""This discovery does not exactly explain how the letter arrived in Australia, but there is no doubt there is a link,"" says Mr Hamel.

""The shipping company Mesnier et Poingdestre was trading in phosphates mined in Micronesia, Naura, and also on the Christmas Islands, and there are Poingdestres living in Queensland,"" Ms Doyle said. ""There may well have been a connection.""

So no chance the hot air balloon made it to Australia? ""No, no, absolutely not,"" answers M. Hamel quite seriously. ""It took a week to get to Normandy.""

All is not well at the Walker home. Terry and Lyndsay aren't talking - Lyndsay's angry that Terry publicly sacked their son Jon for dropping a car from a forklift. Now plans to modernise the business and hand it on to their kids are in jeopardy.

The yard is a refuge for Terry, who's concentrating on what he does best: making money. He's on a mission to get the lads to remove every valuable part before cars get crushed - but even offering them financial incentives doesn't work, and Terry loses his temper.

Though that may not be the only reason - he is missing Jon. Hoping to make up, he texts his son, who comes into the yard. They resolve their issues, but that's only half the job. Terry sends flowers to Lyndsay, and that night Terry apologises and they kiss and make up.

In the yard, there is an air of optimism. Jon and Lyndsay are back, and everyone wants to get the business running efficiently. But when Terry ventures into the sales office, he sees some of the staff are getting things wrong - and when he calls the office pretending to be customers, things get worse.

Lyndsay and Terry try something totally new - proper job interviews to find new staff. But until they find the right people, they move Jon and daughter Cathy into the sales office. Terry takes Lyndsay for dinner - they may be talking again, but there are lots of challenges ahead.",[]

bbc.com,2015-03-11 00:00:00,Can Canada teach the rest of us to be nicer?,['Eric Weiner'],"Every August my family embarks on that great American ritual: the road trip. And we always head north. Canada may not be the most exotic of destinations, but sometimes, exotic is overrated. Canada tempts us with familiarity, blissfully cool weather and, most of all, a deep reservoir of niceness.

We experience Canadian nice as soon as we reach customs. The US border guards are gruff and all business. The Canadians, by contrast, are unfailingly polite, even as they grill us about the number of wine bottles were bringing into the country. One year, we had failed to notice that our 9-year-old daughters passport had expired. They, nicely, let us enter anyway. The niceness continues for our entire trip, as we encounter nice waiters, nice hotel clerks, nice strangers.

Canadian niceness is pure, and untainted by the passive-aggressive undertones found in American niceness (have a good day, or else!). Its also abundant. Canada is to niceness as Saudi Arabia is to oil. Its awash in the stuff, and its about time, I say, the rest of the world imported some. (France, Russia and the UK topped one recent list of rude countries as perceived by travellers.) Researchers have yet to analyse Canadian niceness empirically, but studies have found that Canadians, perhaps in an effort not to offend, use an overabundance of hedge words, such as could be and not bad. Then there is the most coveted of Canadian words: sorry. Canadians will apologize for anything and to anything.

I've apologized to a tree that I walked into, confessed Michael Valpy, a journalist and author, noting that many of his fellow citizens have done the same.

Traffic in Toronto and Montreal may be awful, but you almost never hear a horn, even in the most frustrating traffic jams, said Jeffrey Dvorkin, a Canadian journalism professor at the University of Toronto. Horn-honking is regarded as unnecessarily aggressive. And murder rates in Canada are low, he said, partly because its quite rude to murder someone.

The Canadian press is rife with examples of niceness in action. For instance, the National Post reported that in Edmonton, a law student, Derek Murray, left his headlights on all day. When he returned to his car, he found the battery drained and a note on his windshield. I noticed you left your lights on, it read. The battery will probably not have enough charge to start your vehicle. I left a blue extension cord on the fence and ... a battery charger beside the fence in the cardboard box. The note went on to explain exactly how to jump-start the vehicle. Good luck, it added. In Ontario, a thief returned the goods he or she stole with $50 attached to a letter of apology. ""I can't put it into words how sorry I am,"" the thief explained. ""Please find it in your hearts to forgive the stranger who harmed you.""

Canadians arent only polite; theyre incredibly humble too, and reluctant to take credit for even plainly heroic acts. When a gunman attacked the Canadian parliament building in October 2014, Kevin Vickers, Canadas sergeant-at-arms, responded quickly and calmly by shooting the assailant with the handgun he keeps in his office.And while Vickers was glorified in the Canadian media, it was his humility, not his marksmanship or bravado, that was celebrated. (Canadians take great pride in their humility, an oxymoron that bothers no one.)

What explains this blizzard of humility and politeness? Taras Grescoe, a Montreal-based writer, believes Canadian niceness is born of necessity. We're a small group of people, spread across the second-largest national territory in the world, he said. We've always known that, in order to survive  or just stay sane  we had to watch out for one another. The old lady down the street, the teenager at the bus stop who forgot to bring a scarf when it's 5 below. Hence our general willingness to proffer assistance rather than aggression.""

Another explanation for Canadian niceness stems from the fragment theory. First posited by the US scholar Louis Hartz, the theory states that colonial societies such as the United States and Canada began as fragments of the European nations they were escaping from. These new nations remain, in effect, frozen in time. Thus, Canada retains a conservative, Tory streak  that is, with a more deferential, nicer nature than the one embraced by the feisty US founding fathers.

Not everyone believes this is a good thing. Valpy sees Canadian niceness as a defence mechanism, one that stems from inferiority and an awkward awareness that our clothes don't fit properly and we always have bad haircuts and really don't do anything great.

Also, in the land of nice, problems sometimes fester because everyone is too nice to say anything. Manjushree Thapa, a writer who recently moved to Canada from Nepal, recalls sitting in a movie theatre when the screen grew dimmer and dimmer as the projection bulb slowly burned out. The screen was almost black but no one spoke up. Exasperated, she finally prodded her Canadian partner to alert the management, which he did, reluctantly. Niceness can silence people here, she said.

Overall, though, shell take nice any day. And so will I. Life is hard enough, with plenty of jagged edges and pointy bits. Why not coat it with a glaze of politeness and humility? Politeness, at its best, is a way of honouring others, especially strangers. Politeness is the lubricant that makes social interactions run smoothly and reduces the risk of conflagrations. The world, I think, would be a better place if we were all a bit more Canadian.

Fortunately, Canadian niceness is contagious. On my annual northern migration, I find myself slowing down, saying thank you and please more often that I usually do. Maybe I go too far and cross the line from polite to unctuous. If I do, I can only say, in true Canadian fashion, Im sorry.

A note on terminology:

The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",[]

Fan-throated lizards are small ground dwellers. The males flaunt a multihued, fan-shaped fold of skin on their throats during the breeding season.

Because they live in dry and barren soils, when the midday heat starts to get to them they skitter about on their rear legs.

Fan-throated lizards are restricted to parts of South Asia. Little has been known about them since the first species was reported in 1829 from India. After this, only six more species have been found: three from Nepal, two from Sri Lanka and one from India.

But V. Deepak of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore did not believe there could be only two species of fan-throated lizards in a country as diverse in its topography as India. So he set out to find more.

Deepak and his colleagues surveyed 81 locations scattered over 61,776 square miles (160,000 sq km) across five Indian states and a union territory.

These areas are quite varied in terms of rainfall patterns and vegetation; there are many mountains and river barriers to aid the evolution of new species, says Deepak.

""You won't realize it  they all look like dry, open habitats  but if you go across all these landscapes, which is what I did for three years, I got to know that Peninsular India is much more heterogeneous than we thought,"" Deepak says.

During his travels he found five new species. Three belong to Sitana, the genus known before, and two to a new genus that Deepak calls Sarada, which is the local name for fan-throated lizards.

The findings have been published in the journal Contributions to Zoology.

Armed with specimens from the field, Deepak's team then got started on identifying the features that separate one species from the other.

One such feature was the morphology, including size and colour, of the dewlap: a loose, foldable flap on the throat that becomes more vivid as males grow and become sexually mature. Females do not have dewlaps.

A male fan-throated lizard will use his dewlap to woo a would-be partner by puffing it into a fan. This is made possible by the extension of a cartilaginous structure underneath the skin.

When displaying, males climb to higher ground  like a boulder or tree branch  then arch their backs upwards and stretch out the fan.

During displays, males of the genus Sitana often bob their heads up and down, while those of Sarada shake their heads left and right.

With these new discoveries, there are now 7 species of fan-throated lizards from India and 12 from the whole of South Asia. The researchers are hopeful they will find more in other unexplored areas.

Sitana visiri (Palm leaf fan-throated lizard)

The dewlap of this species is large, extending up to 56% of the trunk's length. It is serrated on the edge and thus resembles a hand-crafted palm leaf fan called ""visiri"" in the language of the southernmost Indian state of Tamil Nadu, where these lizards are found. The iridescent white dewlap has a prominent sky blue streak and orange spots.

The slender-bodied S. visiri prefers lowland habitats such as sandy coasts and grassland plains. It breeds during September and October with young ones hatching in January.

Sitana spinaecephalus (Spiny-headed fan-throated lizard)

This species derives its name from the Latin word ""spinae"", meaning ""spine"", and the Greek word ""cephalus"", meaning ""head"". It refers to the enlarged, spiny scales on the back of its head.

S. spinaecephalus is adapted to a life in both lowland and higher elevations of Gujarat and Maharashtra states. It was found basking on twigs and rocks in grasslands and river beds.

It too has a large dewlap, which extends up to 45% of the length of the trunk. The dewlap is yellow with a blue stripe and brown spots.

Males display to the females from May to early June.

Sitana laticeps (Broad-headed fan-throated lizard)

This species gets its name from the Latin prefix ""latus"" meaning ""broad"" and the suffix ""cep"" meaning ""head"".

It is found in rocky terrains dotted with grasses and scrubs, at altitudes ranging from 1683 to 3051 feet (513 to 930 m) above sea level. The species is confined to the hills around the city of Pune in Maharashtra.

S. laticeps has a slightly serrated, medium-sized, off-white dewlap with a blue streak on its lower jaw. The dewlap runs along 29% of the length of the trunk. Males display perched on rocks during May, June and August.

Sarada darwini (Darwin's large fan-throated lizard)

This species is found in the grasslands and cotton fields of south Maharashtra and north Karnataka, at an altitude ranging from 1804 to 2231 feet (550 to 680 m) above sea level.

It lives in deep underground crevices and can be seen basking on tufts of grass, twigs, rocks and mounds, sometimes in pairs.

Breeding takes place in May and the newly-hatched young emerge in October.

Sexually-mature males have iridescent blue, black and orange patches with yellow stripes on their large dewlap. The orange colour extends all the way down to the belly.

The species is named after Charles Darwin, who referred to the ""throat-pouch"" of a fan-throated lizard in his book The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, to illustrate secondary sexual traits in reptiles.

Sarada superba (Superb large fan-throated lizard)

Extending along 59% of the trunk, S. superba sports the largest dewlap of all the five new species. The dewlap has elongated, overlapping scales with yellow stripes on the throat. It is a prominent, iridescent blue, followed by patches of black and orange.

The species' name comes from the Latin word ""superbus"", meaning ""magnificent"", and refers to the vibrant colours of its dewlap.

The lizard prefers high plateaus 3609 to 4265 feet (1100 to 1300 m) above sea level in southern Maharashtra. It hides among rocks and crevices.

S. superba males are highly territorial. When one spots a rival nearby, he warns it off by raising his crest: an additional flap that runs all the way down from the nape of the neck to the animal's rear.",[]

Cinco hombres recibieron este miercoles condenas de seis a siete anos de carcel por el famoso robo de joyas en centro de Londres durante la Semana Santa de 2015.

Los cinco hombres se hicieron famosos despues de robar un deposito de seguridad lleno de piedras preciosas valoradas en US$20 millones en el distrito de Hatton Garden y que fue considerado el robo del siglo en Reino Unido.

John ""Kenny"" Collins, de 75 anos; Terry Perkins, de 67 anos; y Daniel Jones, de 61, recibieron una condena de siete anos de prision por ser los autores materiales del hecho.

Otros dos miembros de la banda, Carl Wood y William Lincoln, recibieron penas de seis y siete anos respectivamente.

Los cinco implicados se habian declarado culpables del hecho en los ultimos meses y aguardaban por la sentencia.

Sin embargo, Brian Reader, quien esta acusado de ser el autor intelectual del robo y la mente maestra detras de la ejecucion, no pudo asistir al recinto judicial debido a complicaciones de salud.

Image copyright Metropolitan Police Image caption Este fue el orificio que abrieron los ladrones en el deposito de seguridad.

Los miembros de la banda ejecutaron el robo durante los cuatro dias de la Semana Santa del ano anterior y fueron capturados un par de meses despues en distintos operativos en el sur de Reino Unido.

A la antigua

Lejos de los hackeos a codigos de seguridad o los deslizamientos del tipo ""Mision Imposible"", los ladrones de Hatton Garden utilizaron equipos pesados para ingresar a una boveda utilizada principalmente por joyeros y negociantes de oro.

Norman Bean, uno de los empleados de la boveda del Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company, senalo que le dijeron que los delincuentes entraron por el hueco del ascensor.

""Bajaron por el hueco del ascensor, hicieron un gran hoyo en la pared, entraron a la boveda y taladraron hasta llegar a las cajas"", le dijo a la BBC el exjefe del departamento de la policia londinense encargado de investigar robos comerciales armados, Roy Ramm.

""Hay una suerte de audacia de la vieja escuela en el asalto"".

Image copyright AP Image caption La zona es conocida sus bovedas que albergan diamantes.

Segun Ramm, el monto de los bienes sustraidos no sera revelado nunca, ""pero no me sorprenderia que ande por los 200 millones (US$300 millones)"".

Sin embargo, despues se conocio que la cifra era mas cercana a los US$22 millones.

De acuerdo al relato de la policia, la banda de ladrones estuvo trabajando en perforar la pared durante cuatro dias seguidos debido a problemas tecnicos.

""Fue un escandalo, pareciera sacado de una pelicula"", dijo Ramm.

Lo cierto es que a pesar de no dejar ni un solo rastro, la policia logro seguir el rastro de nueve personas mediante la interceptacion de lineas telefonicas. A mediados del mes de mayo se procedio con la captura de ellas.

El area de Hatton Garden se ubica entre la City y el West End, en el centro de Londres. Es conocida por el comercio de diamantes y oro, y por albergar las cajas de seguridad de las piedras preciosas, principalmente diamantes, que no han sido enviadas a las joyerias.

En el area se estima que hay unos 300 negocios y mas de 55 tiendas especializadas en joyas. Esta es la mayor concentracion de joyeros en Reino Unido.

bbc.com,,Woman smuggles child in hand luggage on Paris-bound plane,[],"Image copyright AFP Image caption The woman hid the child in a bag at her feet

A woman flew from Istanbul to Paris with a four-year-old girl hidden inside her hand luggage, Air France has said.

The airline said the child, travelling without a ticket, was discovered on board the flight on Monday night.

An airport source told AFP news agency that the woman was a resident of France who was in the process of adopting the child, from Haiti.

The airline notified the French authorities but prosecutors decided not to press charges.

The woman was in the transit zone in Istanbul but was preventing from boarding her flight with the child, the source told AFP.

She then bought a new flight ticket and hid the child in a bag.

Once on board, she placed the child at her feet under a blanket, but the girl needed to go to the toilet and was noticed by other passengers, the source said.

""The cloth bag belonged to a woman sat at the back of the plane. At one point she opened the bag and her neighbour on the other row of seats saw something moving inside. He alerted flight attendants, who then discovered a baby,"" a passenger named Vincent told French news website Planet.fr (in French).

It was stunning, but I felt unsettled. My Balkan road trip was taking me out of Croatia, and I wasnt even entirely sure that my next destination existed.

Montenegro is only 10 years old, and like many of the Balkans, its history is confusing, with overlapping rulers and muddy origins. For instance, the town of Kotor, previously called Cattaro, has been run by Byzantine Romans, Napoleon, Italians, Habsburgs, Bulgarians, Ottomans and Venetians, the last of whom gave Montenegro its name (from Crna Gora, or Black Mountain). Even less known, perhaps, is that Montenegro separated from Serbia  the last remaining vestige of what was once Yugoslavia  a few months after a March 2006 dispute over which band should represent the two then states in the Eurovision Song Contest.

This media cannot be played on your device.

Montenegros current fame among Balkan travellers arises from its fjord-like Bay of Kotor, where a string of medieval villages lie fringed by mountains that pop up from a submerged ancient river system, the water still like soft mercury. After enduring Dubrovniks crowds  even in winter  the popular Bay of Kotor felt almost private.

I wandered around Kotors atmospheric alleyways and dozen or so churches until my eyes settled upon several ramparts, which seemed to switchback up the steep mountainside like Chinas most famous fortress. Montenegro has a Great Wall? I pondered.

In a way it does. Sitting high above the walled town, the Kotor fortress (sometimes called St John, or Sveti Ivan) protected Montenegros coast  or tried to for centuries. About 1,350 steps later, I found myself exploring the hilltop fortress above the medieval rooftops of Kotor, with the bay and mountains filling the view. No one else was around.

Near the top, I spotted an opening in a wide battered wall. Beyond was a hidden valley that dipped below the ramparts backside. I wandered through and found the ruins of an abandoned village and a fresco-filled church missing most of its roof.

I also saw a sign advertising fresh cheese and brandy, and followed it to an open-air deck that was attached to a lone house. My host used a machete to slice up some fresh bread  gratis, he said with clear panache  and I sipped a beer while nibbling on some cheese. I took in the view of the ramparts, the town and the bay snaking past the mountains.

I may not have known Montenegro before  but I was glad to know about it now.

Pero en Colombia el estrato viene claramente indicado en la factura de los servicios publicos.

Tenia aproximadamente un mes de vivir en Colombia cuando por correo me llego la certificacion de que, al menos en lo que a Bogota se refiere, yo soy estrato cuatro.

En sentido estricto la clasificacion no se aplica a las personas, sino a las viviendas; en mi caso al apartamento que desde ese entonces ocupo en el barrio de Chapinero.

Y el certificado de marras, que se origina en el sistema de subsidios cruzados bajo el que aqui operan los servicios publicos, en realidad no era sino la factura del servicio electrico.

Para entonces, sin embargo, ya entendia que para los colombianos ese numero entre el uno y el seis que figura mensualmente en los recibos de agua, luz y gas no se limita a indicar la tarifa que le corresponde a cada casa.

Tambien es un recordatorio constante del lugar que cada uno ocupa o se supone que debe ocupar en la sociedad colombiana.

""El poder clasificatorio de la estratificacion marca la identidad de los colombianos al punto de que, cuando se busca compania, el estrato se coloca (en los anuncios personales) al lado del sexo, la contextura fisica o la edad"", afirma la sociologa Consuelo Uribe Mallarino.

Segun la investigadora, que ha trabajado el tema durante anos, la estratificacion se ha convertido en ""la forma predominante como los bogotanos y colombianos urbanos en general piensan el orden social"".

Y yo siempre he pensado que el estrato cuatro probablemente es el mas indicado para el corresponsal de un medio publico que se precia de ser balanceado.

Image caption Las viviendas estrato cuatro pagan los servicios basicos a su costo real. En el caso de Bogota constituyen el 10% de los hogares. Los estrato seis, por su parte, suman el 1,8% y los estrato cinco, el 2,7%.

""Se le noto el estrato""

Me explico: las tarifas diferenciadas por estratos son la base del sistema de subsidios cruzados a los servicios publicos que empezo a aplicarse en Colombia en la decada de 1980.

Bajo este esquema, los habitantes de las viviendas mas humildes clasificadas en estratos del uno al tres pagan los servicios por un valor menor de lo que realmente cuestan.

Y con las casas mas lujosas pasa todo lo contrario.

Eso significa que los habitantes de los hogares de estratos cinco y seis subsidian los servicios publicos de los pobladores de mas bajos recursos.

Mientras que las viviendas de estrato cuatro como mi apartamento pagan los servicios a su costo real.

Y no trasplantarse al mundo de la elite privilegiada, pero tampoco aprovecharse del sistema de subsidios disenado por el Estado colombiano, es probablemente lo menos que se debe esperar del corresponsal de la BBC.

Image caption Las viviendas consideradas patrimonio historico, como las del barrio La Candelaria, son consideradas E1. Lo que significa que hay verdaderas mansiones que pagan los servicios a las tarifas mas bajas.

Ademas, en la sociedad colombiana los estratos tambien arrastran una carga simbolica muy importante.

""La ley dice que son las residencias las que estan estratificadas, pero se ha generalizado que se piense que lo que esta estratificado son las personas"", explica Consuelo Mallarino.

""Y esto se ha extendido a sus lugares de estudio, a los parques, a la manera de hablar"", anade la investigadora.

Como resultado, la gente tambien ha terminado asociando estratos con comportamientos, actitudes y hasta valores particulares.

Asi, no es extrano escuchar, por ejemplo, en tono de reproche, expresiones como ""Se le noto el estrato!"", para denunciar un comportamiento considerado vulgar o inadecuado.

Y todavia recuerdo una conversacion, capturada al aire en un bar ""estrato 18"" del norte de Bogota, en el que unas amigas comentaban escandalizadas la relacion de un companero de clase con ""una noviecita estrato tres"".

Image caption Aunque en teoria la estratificacion es para la vivienda, en la practica los colombianos tambien usan la clasificacion para las personas y los lugares que frecuentan.

Sistema de castas?

El estrato 18 en realidad no existe. Y, a pesar de lo que muchos creen, la clasificacion tampoco aplica a centros educativos ni locales comerciales.

Pero los colombianos emplean estas y otras hiperboles como ""estrato 00"" para referirse a los extremos de una sociedad que todavia figura entre las mas inequitativas de todo el planeta.

Obviamente, ni las desigualdades sociales ni la costumbre de vincular comportamientos, actitudes y valores con clases sociales, son algo exclusivamente colombiano.

Y, de hecho, el uso de expresiones como ""naco"", ""cholo"" o ""indio"" en Mexico, la region andina o Centroamerica para describir peyorativamente a las clases populares conlleva una carga de racismo que deberian hacerlas aun mas chocantes que el sistema de estratos colombiano.

Pero la existencia de una nomenclatura oficial para evidenciar la diferencia social -una especie de sistema de castas aceptado por todos y organizado por el Estado- no deja de resultar impactante.

Al menos para los recien llegados a tierras colombianas. Porque los colombianos ya parecen estar acostumbrados.

Image caption La segregacion socio-espacial propiciada por el sistema de estratos ha ayudado a que la mayoria de los ricos se concentren en el norte de Bogota y la mayoria de los pobres en el sur.

""Los colombianos hemos naturalizado los estratos como forma de dividir las ciudades. Nos parece normal, que siempre han existido, que es un sistema que se emplea en todas partes del mundo"", me confirma la academica Uribe.

""Solamente cuando lo ve uno con ojos de extranjero es que lo golpea a uno, que uno como colombiano se pregunta: esto esta bien o no?"", relata.

Cada quien en su lugar

Uribe Mallarino es la vicerrectora de Investigacion de la Universidad Javeriana y ha investigado los estratos en Colombia en terminos de sus efectos sobre la inclusion social, por lo que conversar con ella sobre el tema resulta fascinante.

En su opinion, a pesar de algunos problemas, el sistema ha sido efectivo a la hora de focalizar los subsidios.

Pero tambien ha tenido consecuencias indirectas que hacen que la busqueda de otros mecanismos se vuelva deseable.

""Tenemos tantas cosas que nos dividen, tanta inequidad social, que realmente necesitamos de una politica publica que profundice esas diferencias?"", se pregunta Uribe.

Porque, segun la sociologa, una de las consecuencias materiales del sistema de estratos es que ha propiciado una mayor segregacion socio-espacial en las ciudades del pais, haciendo que cada vez sea mas dificil que las distintas clases sociales se encuentren en un mismo espacio.

Image caption La marcada segregacion socio-espacial de Bogota ha sido agravada por el sistema de focalizacion de subsidios, que no incentiva a la gente a cambiar de estrato.

El problema es que al enfocar los subsidios sobre las residencias, y no sobre los ingresos, el sistema de estratos le ha dado a la diferencia social una clara dimension espacial que ha terminado marcando y segregando el territorio, explica la sociologa.

Y, en cierta forma, tambien ha incentivado a los pobladores a quedarse ""donde les corresponde"".

Uribe cuenta que cuando en varios estudios se le ha preguntado a la gente si se moveria de estrato si se ganara la loteria, la mayoria responde ""no"", porque todo se le volveria mas caro.

""No hay incentivos para moverse de estrato, ni tampoco para mejorar la residencia, porque se corre el riesgo de que le reclasifiquen el estrato y se termine pagando mas"", explica la sociologa.

Buscando un cambio

En el caso de Bogota, eso hace que la gente de los estratos mas bajos se concentre en los extramuros de la ciudad, en la parte mas lejana.

Y la clara segregacion espacial ciertamente tambien ayuda a hacer todavia mas reconocible el origen de clase: muchos colombianos nada mas necesitan saber en que zona o barrio de su ciudad vive una persona para ubicarla dentro de la escala.

Image caption Iniciativas como la Ciclovia le dan a los bogotanos de todos los estratos la oportunidad de mezclarse.

Todo lo anterior no significa que si los estratos no existieran desapareceria la desigualdad de clases.

""En todas partes del mundo hay una estructura de clases que condiciona la forma en que la gente se relaciona y se piensa a si misma"", explica Uribe.

""Pero los estratos nos lo recuerdan constantemente. Lo congelan, lo profundizan"".

Poco a poco, sin embargo, en Colombia se ha empezado a dar la discusion sobre la necesidad de cambiar el modelo de focalizacion de subsidios para el pago de servicios publicos.

Image caption El transporte publico, otro lugar de encuentro. Pero no para todos los estratos.

Y Consuelo Uribe espera que en un futuro proximo ya no tendra que explicarles a otros corresponsales por que Colombia divide a su poblacion en estratos.

""Espero que en 10 anos ya se haya desmontado la estratificacion a las residencias, se hayan identificado formas de focalizar subsidios que vayan con los habitantes y no con el lugar donde viven. Y ojala eso signifique mayor mezcla social"", le dice a BBC Mundo.

Aunque el problema es que hasta ahora solo Bogota esta planteando la discusion y la ley que fija los estratos tiene caracter nacional.

Mientras, en cualquier caso todos los residentes de las ciudades colombianas tienen su numero del uno al seis.

El mio es cuatro, ciertamente no el mas alto.

Pero si uno considera que solamente el 10% de los hogares de Bogota merecen esa clasificacion, la verdad es que soy un privilegiado.",[]

bbc.com,2016-02-16 00:00:00,A lake that hides a 500-year-old secret,['Krista Eleftheriou'],"High in the remote northwestern Andes is a stunning mountain lake thats held a secret for more than 500 years.

Laguna de los Condores, located in northern Perus remote Chachapoyas region, became one of the countrys most important Inca sites in 1997 when archaeologists discovered hundreds of mummies in a mausoleum built into the steep surrounding cliff-face. Those bodies are now conserved in the nearby Leymebamba Museum, but thousands more preserved corpses are thought to remain in 17 other mausoleums hidden in the jungle-covered mountains  still unexcavated due to the high cost of archaeology work in this remote region.

Incredibly, just 150 people trek to this little-known spot each year. But that looks set to change with the construction of Peru's first cable car to the nearby archaeology site of Kuelap. Located just 80km north of Laguna de los Condores, Kuelaps mountain top ruins, known as the Machu Picchu of the north, were a religious and political centre for the pre-Inca Chachapoyan people. The July 2016 opening of the cable car  along with plans to start commercial flights to the region  means that the coming months and years will see increasing numbers of visitors to the entire Chachapoyas area.

According to bio-anthropologist Dr Sonia Guillen, Peru's leading expert on mummies, the Laguna de los Condores excavation is one of the most significant discoveries relating to the Inca period in South America, as its one of only two known large Inca burial sites to have escaped destruction by Spanish conquistadors.

""The finding was sort of a miracle,"" Guillen said when I met her at the Leymebamba Museum. ""These mummies are very significant, because they are the first to show us how the Incas prepared their dead in the royal way. They cured the skin to preserve it and made it into leather and they extracted the organs through the anus.""

The mummified bodies were then wrapped in woven textiles and surrounded with artefacts and offerings, such as pots, feathers, woven baskets and quipus: knotted Inca tools that recorded stories and accounting.

She explained that the Laguna de los Condores mummies likely held high positions in Inca society, due to the elaborate burial process and the lack of wear and tear on the bones usually associated with manual labour. One of the reasons the Inca mummified their elite was to keep them connected with the community.

The Incas revered their royal dead because they were still very much part of the world of the living, Guillen said. The Inca mummy participated in meetings, still held property and made decisions.

Guillen took me around me the rows of mummies that lined the museum shelves, some still wrapped in the traditional funeral dressing, others with their skeletons visible, their bodies arranged into the foetal position.

""Each mummy can tell you a story. This guy died when he was 17 or 18 years old; we know that because of his teeth,"" she said, pointing out one of the bodies. ""He was a bird catcher because his body is wrapped in nets. Feathers were of high value in Inca society and a bird catcher was a prestigious role.

I was so intrigued by her tales that I decided to hike the 10-hour track from the village of Leymebamba to Laguna de los Condores, passing through dense Amazon jungle and muddy rolling savanna along the way. The view that greeted me was spectacular. Draped in clouds, soaring mountains rose up from the lake, waterfalls flowed down the sheer face and everything reflected in the dark lagoon water.

After a night in a mud-floor farmhouse, my guide Eilen and I crossed the lake in a small boat. Eilen fished, catching trout to make a dinner of traditional Andean trucha (fried fish in a lemon or cream sauce). He pointed out the location near the base of the mountain where two mummies had been found. Only the wooden platform that held the bodies remained; the mummies have since been removed for conservation. But it was these two mummies that had provided the first clues that this was no ordinary body of water.

An hour later we reached the opposite side of the lagoon and started the steep, muddy hike through thick jungle. With a machete in hand, Eilen carved a track and we passed under waterfalls and climbed ladders left behind by the archaeologists. On our arrival, we found several painted buildings where the mummies were originally housed. There were scattered bones and skulls on the ground and ancient artwork of animals and symbols painted on the walls.

According to Guillen, burial sites such as the Laguna de Los Condores mausoleums were crucial to the Incas' success in taking control of the region, culture and the people, as they replaced the Chachapoyan way of burial with the Inca tradition of mummification.

""When the Incas conquered this area, they replaced the funerary pattern. They emptied the mausoleums [of the pre-Inca Chachapoya dead] and conquered their spirit by conquering their sacred places,"" she said.

I sat among the mausoleum ruins, looking out over the lake towards the village ruins on the opposite side where the Inca, and before them the Chachapoyan people, had lived. A waterfall flowed down the cliff in front me. I thought of the people that had lived here, wondering how they had managed to construct buildings in such steep jungle-covered cliffs.

It seemed phenomenal that such a beautiful place that was once a thriving community for more than 500 years could be abandoned during the Spanish conquest, reclaimed by nature and lie hidden for half a millennium.

I couldnt help but wonder what else was hidden in the mountains.",[]

O produtor musical dos Beatles, George Martin, morreu aos 90 anos, anunciou nesta quarta-feira o ex-Beatle Ringo Starr em seu perfil no Twitter.

As causas de sua morte ainda nao foram divulgadas.

Conhecido como ""o quinto Beatle"", Martin nao so descobriu o grupo - apesar de, na epoca, dizer que o grupo ""nao era muito bom"" - como teve papel fundamental no acabamento das musicas do grupo.

Ele produziu mais de 700 albuns ao longo de sua carreira de cinco decadas. Seu conhecimento tecnico e gosto pela experimentacao permitiram que produzisse sons inovadores com equipamentos que musicos modernos considerariam primitivos.

Ele tambem trabalhou com artistas como Dire Straits, Celine Dion, Sting e os Rolling Stones.

O baterista dos Beatles disse no Twitter que ""George fara falta"". ""Obrigado por todo seu amor e gentileza, George. Paz e amor"", escreveu Ringo.

Sean Ono Lennon, filho de John Lennon, tuitou: ""R.I.P. George Martin. Estou tao desapontado que nao tenho muitas palavras.""

Liam Gallagher, do Oasis, banda que tinha os Beatles como modelo, tambem lamentou a morte na rede social.

Beatles

George Henry Martin nasceu em 1926, filho de um carpinteiro e uma faxineira, no norte de Londres

Sua paixao por musica despertou quando assistiu a uma apresentacao da London Symphony Orchestra no salao da escola.

No final da Segunda Guerra, ele treinou para ser piloto. Em 1947, ele tocava oboe profissionalmente, apesar de nao saber, ainda, ler ou escrever notas musicais.

Image copyright Getty Image caption Martin em foto com os Beatles em 1963

Depois de se formar na Guildhall School of Music, trabalhou no departamento de musica classica da BBC, antes de ser contratado pela EMI como produtor musical, onde, rapidamente, se familiarizou com a mesa de som e outros recursos do estudio de gravacao de Abbey Road.

Cinco anos depois, aos 29 anos de idade, como chefe do selo Parlophone, trabalhou com artistas como Shirley Bassey, Matt Monro e grupos de jazz de Johnny Dankworth e Humphrey Lyttelton.

Martin tambem produziu gravacoes de comediantes como Bernard Cribbins e Peter Sellers.

Foi nessa epoca, em 1962, que recebeu a visita de Brian Epstein, querendo mostrar a fita demo de uma banda que empresariava.

Aquela altura, The Beatles haviam sido rejeitados por todas as grandes gravadoras do pais. O proprio Martin ficou mais impressionado com a personalidade dos musicos e sua sagacidade do que por sua musica.

""Eles eram estridentes"", disse depois. ""Nao muito afinados. Eles nao eram muito bons"", contou.

Mesmo assim, ele assinou com os quatro, e Love Me Do se tornou o primeiro sucesso deles, em 1962. A partir dai, teve inicio a parceria de gravadora mais bem-sucedida de todos os tempos.

Pelos oito anos seguintes, Martin conduziu os ""Fab Four"" (os ""Quatro Fabulosos"", como ficaram conhecidos na Gra-Bretanha) do rock'n'roll basico de I Want to Hold Your Hand a experimentacao ambiciosa de Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band e Abbey Road.

A parceria Martin-Beatles representou uma mudanca radical tanto para o produtor quanto para os musicos. Martin, que era musico de formacao classica, tinha pouca experiencia com musica pop e a banda nao tinha ideia das possibilidades oferecidas por um estudio.

Martin tinha o dom de conseguir traduzir as arriscadas ideia de Lennon e McCartney em termos praticos de gravacao.

Enquanto McCartney conseguia expressar seus pedidos, Lennon era um pouco mais vago. Se ele procurava pelo que descrevia como ""um som laranja"", Martin assumia a tarefa de encontra-lo.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Ringo Starr e sir George Martin no Grammy, em 2008

Em uma entrevista em 1975, John Lennon disse que a relacao com Martin era uma ""verdadeira parceria"".

""Algumas pessoas dizem que George Martin fez tudo, outras dizem que os Beatles fizeram tudo. Nao foi nenhuma das duas opcoes. Nos aprendemos muito juntos"", afirmou.

O treinamento erudito de Martin se tornou ainda mais importante a medida que os Beatles forcavam os limites da musica. Ele compos e conduziu o arranjo de cordas de Eleanor Rigby e o ecletico pano de fundo de I Am The Walrus.

E tudo isso com o que, hoje em dia, seria considerado um equipamento de gravacao bem basico, que ele levou ao limite para a gravacao do album Sgt. Pepper.

Na epoca, a EMI so tinha gravadores de quatro pistas, entao Martin e seus tecnicos desenvolveram uma tecnica de acoplar dois gravadores de rolo de quatro pistas a uma mesa de mixagem, conseguindo, na pratica, usar 8 canais de gravacao.

Ele tambem conseguiu efeitos inusitados alterando a velocidade do gravador, para mudar a textura do som final, uma tecnica usada em Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.

Algumas pessoas dizem que George Martin fez tudo, outras dizem que os Beatles fizeram tudo. Nao foi nenhuma das duas opcoes. Nos aprendemos muito juntos"" John Lennon

Furacao

Apos o fim dos Beatles, Martin trabalhou com diversos artistas.

No final dos anos 1970, ele construiu um estudio na ilha caribenha de Montserrat, onde gravaram grupos como Dire Straits e The Rolling Stones.

Quando o furacao Hugo destruiu a ilha e o estudio em 1989, Martin produziu um album para arrecadar fundos para as vitimas.

Em 1997, Elton John pediu sua ajuda para produzir a regravacao da musica Candle in the Wind em versao feita para o funeral da princesa Diana.

Ele convenceu o cantor a sentar no estudio e gravar exatamente como havia tocado na Abadia de Westminster. O resultado foi o 30o hit numero 1 nas paradas produzido por Martin - mais do que qualquer outro produtor.",[]

bbc.com,2015-09-21 00:00:00,Indias temples of sex,['Charukesi Ramadurai'],"In December 2013, Indias LGBT community suffered a severe setback as the countrys Supreme Court ruled homosexuality to be a criminal offence. More recently, in August 2015, the Indian government imposed a ban, lifted conditionally a few days later, on more than 800 websites deemed pornographic, in an ostensible bid to curb child pornography and sexual violence.

But India was not always like this. Sexual norms were far more liberal before the 13th Century.

India has been a particularly conservative country for the last few hundred years, influenced by the puritanism of several groups, including Islamic dynasties, British overlords and the countrys own Brahmin priestly caste. But India was not always like this. Sexual norms were far more liberal before the 13th Century, giving equal importance to the secular and the spiritual. Sex was taught as a subject in formal education, and Kamasutra, the worlds first sex treatise, was written in ancient India between the 4th Century BCE and the 2nd Century.

In fact, if you look closely, reminders of these more liberal times can be seen across the country. Theyre literally carved in stone in the form of erotic motifs on the lower walls of the 13th Century Sun Temple at Konark in the east Indian state of Orissa. Nudity is prominent in the paintings and sculptures of heavenly maidens at Maharashtras Buddhist rock-cut monastic caves, Ajanta (2nd Century BCE) and Ellora (5th to 10th Centuries).

India's most graphic example of erotic temple art

However, the best-preserved and most graphic example of erotic temple art can be found in the small town of Khajuraho in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Its elegantly carved Hindu temples were declared a Unesco World Heritage site in 1986. Built by the Chandela dynasty between 950 and 1050, only 22 of the 85 original temples remain.

When I entered the 6sqkm site late one winter afternoon, the sandstone glowed a burnished gold. Local women carried fresh flowers and incense sticks for their prayers, while visitors perambulated the outer corridors, gawking at the profuse and intricate sculptures that covered every inch of the walls. There were images of gods and goddesses, warriors and musicians, animals and birds. It could have been a scene from any temple in India.

Many of these carvings were of an intensely erotic nature, featuring men, women and animals.

But on closer inspection, many of these carvings were of an intensely erotic nature, featuring men, women and animals. There were depictions of threesomes, orgies and bestiality. Although I knew what to expect, I was still taken aback by shapely maidens and virile men contorting their bodies in impossible sexual positions, right next to sculptures of divine beings smiling blissfully at the devout. Although a few stones were chipped and several limbs broken, the carvings were incredibly pristine, considering that the temples are more than 1,000 years old.

There are various theories about the existence of such graphic erotic motifs. One of the more exotic ones propounds that since Chandela kings were followers of Tantric principles, which dictate the balance between the male and female forces, they promoted their faith in the temples they created.

Some believe the depiction of sexual activities was considered a good omen.

Other theories have to do with the role of temples themselves in those times: they were considered places of learning as well as worship  especially of the finer arts, including the art of lovemaking. In addition, some believe that the depiction of sexual activities in temples was considered a good omen because it represented new beginnings and new life.

That apart, Hinduism has traditionally considered sex an essential part of life, which could be why the carvings are casually interspersed between others that portray activities as varied as prayer and war. The fact that they are set in plain view and not tucked away in an obscure corner seems to suggest that their creators meant for them to be seen by all.

Isolation helped these graphic motifs survive

Bizarrely, theres no reason why these ornate temples were built at Khajuraho, since theres no clear record of whether there was even a kingdom in this location. The survival of these graphic motifs can likely be attributed to their isolation for hundreds of years in the regions once-thick forest, only rediscovered by Englishman Captain TS Burt in 1838. In fact, Burt himself had to be persuaded by his Indian attendants to make the journey; he didnt believe anything of interest would be found at the remote spot. These charmed temples have also managed to evade the wrath of Indias moral police, who in recent years banned or destroyed a range of cultural artefacts, ranging from Salman Rushdies books to MF Hussains paintings.

But what I found even more interesting than the explicit carvings and the history behind them was the fact that entire families were quietly engrossed in the guides speech as he analysed the spicier carvings high on the walls of the magnificent Kandariya Mahadeva temple. No eyebrows were raised, no embarrassed looks were exchanged, no giggles escaped young lips. Perhaps the art is unobjectionable when crouched within a religious context  but I came away believing that Khajuraho holds within its walls a larger lesson on tolerance for India.",[]

With VR starting to become available through YouTube as cardboard, as well as 360 degree video, weve tried to produce a series of short films that take the audience to Monterey Bay, to experience some its amazing environments and wildlife.

What are you hoping it will achieve?

We want the audience to experience something theyd never see on a flat screen, and come away with an whole new understanding of the natural world.

How did you film this?

Where to start! We shot with a Google / GoPro Jump rig and a 360heroes underwater rig. We also cobbled together stabilisation rigs, which would be (mostly) hidden from the camera.

What did you learn from working with VR?

We are just starting to understand how to make VR experiences really. YouTube is still very low bandwidth and screens are low refresh rates (for VR at least), but this will change but as these improve, we hope to be ready to make better films.",[]

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,'Laboratorio do amor' identifica 4 'venenos' de relacionamentos,[],"Existe um espaco na Universidade de Washington, Estados Unidos, que tem um nome curioso: o laboratorio do amor.

Nas ultimas quatro decadas o especialista em relacionamentos John Gottman e sua equipe ja estudaram mais de 3 mil casais.

Gottman afirma que pode prever com precisao de 90% se um casal vai permanecer junto ou nao.

Mas o especialista tambem da conselhos para que casais consigam salvar seus relacionamentos, detectando os sinais de problemas e mudando a dinamica entre os dois.

Veja abaixo os ""venenos"" que, segundo Gottman, podem acabar com relacionamentos e os ""antidotos"" que podem salva-los.

1. Critica

Se voce critica seu parceiro, ele/ela podera pensar que e um ataque a sua personalidade ou a sua natureza.

Isto e muito mais prejudicial ao relacionamento do que uma queixa ou um comentario negativo solto.

E este e o mais comum dos quatro sinais de alerta de problemas no relacionamento.

2. Desprezo

Este e o mais forte pressagio do fracasso de um relacionamento e geralmente se alimenta de pensamentos negativos guardados por muito tempo a respeito do companheiro/companheira.

Nesse caso, e preciso prestar atencao a sinais reveladores como o uso do sarcasmo, insultos, zombaria ou ridicularizacao.

Mesmo que na hora tudo pareca inofensivo, sao expressoes que frequentemente levam apenas ao conflito e nao a resolucao.

3. Estar sempre na defensiva

Image caption O silencio em meio a crise pode evitar o confronto mas tambem trazer consequencias depois

Ao se sentir atacado em uma relacao, a reacao mais comum e proteger os sentimentos, se fechando ou reagindo com raiva.

Essa autoprotecao e uma tentativa de evitar o que pode ser percebido como um ataque.

Muitos se colocam na defensiva quando criticam o parceiro/parceira, mas na verdade e uma forma de culpar o outro.

4. O tratamento do silencio

Ao perceber que nao consegue lidar com os tres sinais acima, seu parceiro/parceira (ou voce) pode reagir se desconectando, dando as costas, fingindo estar ocupado ou demonstrando algum comportamento obsessivo.

Isto evita o confronto. Mas esse fechamento dos canais de comunicacao tambem tem como um dos efeitos o aumento no ritmo cardiaco a mais de cem batimentos por minuto, o que nos deixa fisicamente sobrecarregados.

*Os antidotos

Se o relacionamento enfrenta qualquer um dos problemas citados acima, Gottman aconselha a adocao de quatro alternativas para aumentar a intimidade:

1. Queixas sem culpa

Image caption Para Gottman, passos simples como respeitar o outro, queixas sem culpar ninguem ou assumir a responsabilidade podem salvar um relacionamento

Fale sobre seus sentimentos com seu companheiro/companheira usando declaracoes que incluam a palavra ""eu"".

Por exemplo: em vez de falar ""voce sempre fala de voce mesmo"", diga ""estou me sentindo ignorado (a); poderiamos falar sobre como foi o meu dia?"".

2. Cultura do respeito

Pense de forma positiva sobre seu parceiro/parceira, concentrando-se em suas caracteristicas positivas.

Demonstre estima e afeto.

Mude expressoes como ""voce e estupido(a)"" por ""estou orgulhoso(a) pela forma como voce lidou com essa situacao"".

3. Assuma a responsabilidade

Mesmo nas situacoes em que os dois nao estao de acordo, escute o que o outro tem a dizer e assuma parte da responsabilidade.

Diga: ""deveria ter me apressado"" em vez de ""e culpa sua estarmos sempre atrasados"".

4. Calma

Espere 20 minutos para reduzir seu ritmo cardiaco antes de comecar uma discussao.

Saia para caminhar ou leia um livro e apenas depois volte a conversar.

*Comunicacao e conselhos

Falar nao e o mesmo que comunicar - e ""frequentemente ninguem nos ensina como nos comunicamosr, nem na escola e nem em casa"", diz Peter Saddlington, psicologo da Relate UK, organizacao britanica que ha 70 anos oferece apoio a casais.

Image caption Respeito e fundamental para manter um relacionamento, segundo especialistas

A Relate UK tambem tem tres recomendacoes principais:

- Peca conselhos

O mero fato de falar com alguem que nao seja parte da relacao pode ajudar.

Se voce nao gosta muito de falar, tente desenhar o que voce sente ou pensa.

- Programe-se

Separe, semanalmente, um tempo para a comunicacao do casal. Estabeleca regras basicas, nao interrompa o outro nem de solucoes imediatas. Empatize com o parceiro/parceira.

- Busque solucoes

Se as investidas amorosas do parceiro(a) despertam apenas frieza, voce pode estar sofrendo com a raiva e o ressentimento acumulados.

Em vez de evitar esse aspecto de seu relacionamento, converse sobre seus sentimentos.",[]

bbc.com,,US election 2016: Has Donald Trump killed off Marco Rubio?,"['Anthony Zurcher', 'North America Reporter']","Donald Trump won two more states on his march toward the Republican nomination - did he kill off Marco Rubio's presidential dream in the process?

Call it ""lesser Tuesday"" - the respite between the blockbuster Southern primaries on 1 March and the key winner-take-all votes in Ohio and Florida on 15 March.

While the voting in Mississippi, Michigan, Idaho and Hawaii doesn't have the same kind of glamour or import as the other key electoral dates in March, that doesn't mean there aren't lessons to learn from the day's results.

The Marco Rubio death watch

Fourth place stings. If Marco Rubio were an Olympian, he'd be clapping politely and picking a nice spot to watch the medal ceremony. If it were a horse race, Rubio backers would be tearing up their betting slips.

Once again the Florida senator took a drubbing across the board, with single-digit finishes in both Michigan and Mississippi netting him zero convention delegates.

He may only place a few percentage points ahead of Ben Carson in Mississippi, who dropped out of the race last week and hasn't had a political pulse in weeks. It's got so bad Donald Trump didn't even feel compelled to belittle the candidate in his victory speech.

Full results - how the states were won

In hindsight his decision to wage total war against Mr Trump, flinging mud with both fists, was a disastrous mistake. And if his attacks were supposed to be a selfless kamikaze mission against the front-runner, well, the USS Trump is still steaming ahead.

Mr Rubio now has exactly one week to pull off a minor miracle and defeat Mr Trump in his home state of Florida. A win there likely won't improve his presidential prospects, which are basically zero, but it could salvage his pride. It would also do a great service for the anti-Trump forces, who are now largely left hoping for a primary season that ends in a draw and a brokered convention.

Top Trump

Reports of Donald Trump's demise are ... well, you know the drill by now.

After taking a beating from Mr Rubio and Ted Cruz at the Republican debate last week and being denounced by 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney on Saturday, the media were rife with reports that the front-runner's formidable armour might be cracking. He underperformed in voting on Saturday, posting losses in Kansas and Maine and only narrow wins in Kentucky and Louisiana. Perhaps the relentless attacks were finally taking a toll?

Er, no.

Mr Trump once again showed he has nationwide appeal. He dominated the vote in a Southern state not bordering Mr Cruz's Texas home, and rolled to victory in Michigan. That second win is particularly key, since the South is largely done voting but the Mid-West - with its blue-collar voters hit hard by the decline in US manufacturing - is just starting to weigh in.

Who is voting for Donald Trump?

In search of Trump's Scottish roots

Trump detractors may take some solace in the fact that both Michigan and Mississippi held primaries that were open to non-Republicans - a setup that has favoured the New Yorker in the past. Most of the remaining states only allow participation by registered Republicans.

They shouldn't get their hopes up too high, however. According to exit polls in both Michigan and Mississippi, Mr Trump performed equally well among Republicans and the unaffiliated.

Mr Trump is now in a position to deliver a mortal blow to his opponents next week and send the Republican establishment into full-on paroxysms of despair.

Cruz and Kasich survive

Going into Tuesday's voting, some thought that Mr Cruz could build on his weekend momentum and post a surprise win in Mississippi. Others speculated that Ohio Governor John Kasich could demonstrate his Mid-Western appeal and pull out a Michigan victory, as he invested considerable time and money there.

In the end Mr Trump won by comfortable margins in each state - which is hardly good news for either challenger.

Is Cruz the most radical Republican?

Mr Kasich can find a bit of a silver lining in Mr Rubio's abysmal performance, however. Without the Florida senator in the picture, he looks likely to pick up the mantle of the mainstream, moderate candidate. Of course this primary landscape is now littered with the bodies of establishment politicians, so he may not want to get too comfortable.

As for Mr Cruz, he pushed Mr Kasich for second place in Michigan, which has to be encouraging. If he's going to battle Mr Trump all the way to the Republican convention, the Texas senator will have to continue to show support outside his native South. He did beat Mr Trump in sparsely populated Idaho but the delegate prize was tiny.

Good news, bad news for Clinton

Once again Hillary Clinton posted a dominating win in a Southern state, taking Mississippi by nearly 70% and netting a lion's share of its 36 delegates.

Michigan was another story, however. Although polls showed her with a comfortable lead, Democratic voters had other ideas - and Bernie Sanders delivered a surprise defeat to the front-runner.

The good news for the former secretary of state is that big wins coupled with narrow losses will only continue her climb ahead of the Vermont senator in the all-important delegate count for the Democratic convention. Thanks to her dominating performance across the South, she's already built up a sizable lead, and Tuesday's balloting will add to it.

The most progressive president ever?

The bad news is that the South is nearly done voting, and the Michigan results could indicate that she will be in a dogfight with Mr Sanders in the Mid-West. While she still is the odds-on favourite to win the nomination, a series of narrow victories - or losses - from here on out will do little to encourage Mr Sanders to quit the race.

Instead, she seems destined to grind out a long, hard primary campaign against a stubborn opponent.

bbc.com,,Sir George Martin 'made' The Beatles,"['Arts Editor', 'Will Gompertz']","Image copyright Reuters

Sir George Martin was more than simply the fifth Beatle, insomuch as there probably wouldn't be any Beatles without him. He made them.

When he first heard the band's demo he was unimpressed. But he liked their manager Brian Epstein, he really liked the lads, and he was on the look out for a band for his Parlophone label, which at that point was mainly producing comedy LPs.

So, he needed them. But they needed him a whole lot more. They were like an orchestra without a conductor: a group of individuals, not a band greater than the sum of its parts.

Sir George sorted that out. He was their creative inspiration, the person who shaped their sound and turned what was tantamount to a skiffle group into the most famous rock-n-roll band in the world.

When John Lennon wrote Please, Please Me, he did so as an homage to Roy Orbison. Martin was having none of it. Too Slow! He told a disgruntled John. The producer upped the tempo, and Hey presto! The Beatles sound was made.

Sir George was a gifted musician, with a fine set of ears and a manner conducive to getting the most out of temperamental pop stars. He wasn't a shouter or a dictator, but was a cajoler and collaborator. He didn't say, 'Do this!,' but rather, 'how about?...'.

I went to his house fairly recently and was disarmed by his charm: his unaffected blend of humility and humour, informed by a fierce intelligence. He was open, honest, funny and wise. He loved The Beatles. Not just because they were 'his' co-creation, but because of who they were as individuals. It was their personalities that first attracted him to them, and it was their friendship that he treasured most.

Sir George Martin's contribution to music and culture is colossal. His work touched the lives of tens of millions of people around the world: it united rivals and inspired generations. He was a visionary musician, a brilliant arranger, and a genius producer. He never boasted or put himself forward. Why should he? His work always spoke for itself.",[]

bbc.com,,Tuition fees: Is England more expensive than US?,"['Sean Coughlan', 'Education Correspondent']","Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption UCLA in Los Angeles has similar tuition fees to UCLAN in Preston

University tuition fees might be high in England but they are not as eye-wateringly expensive as in the United States.

Or at least that's the conventional wisdom.

But is that really true? Or is it based on extreme examples, like Harvard charging almost $60,000 per year (42,000) or Yale $48,000 (34,000)?

How about looking more widely? For instance UCLA compared with UCLAN?

UCLAN is the University of Central Lancashire in Preston - and its preferred acronym nods towards the sunny campus of UCLA, the University of California, Los Angeles, ranked in the world's top 20 universities.

Preston v Los Angeles

They might sound like different worlds, but UCLAN's fees are now more or less the same as UCLA.

The Preston-based university charges 9,000 per year for tuition for undergraduates - and UCLA charges $13,251, which at current rates is about 9,350.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bernie Sanders has promised to scrap tuition fees

A few weeks ago, before sterling fell against the dollar, the fees in California were actually cheaper.

Or if you compare the University of Washington with the University of Wolverhampton, would you expect tuition fees to be lower at Washington?

Tuition fees in Washington are $11,839 (8,354) compared with 9,000 for courses at Wolverhampton - or any other university in England.

The average across US public universities is $9,410 (6,610).

Peggy Blumenthal of the New York-based Institute of International Education says this touches on one of the biggest misconceptions about US higher education.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption University of California, Berkeley has a ""middle class access plan""

""There is a huge range in tuition costs,"" she says. And in practice, many US universities have comparable costs with those in England and across Europe.

State universities - the great engine room of US higher education - have a two-tier fees system, so that students living in the state pay much less than those from outside.

And for state universities, many students live at home, so they avoid all the extra costs for accommodation.

Housing costs

The other confusion is that when US universities quote prices, they often include bed and board as well as tuition.

Parents in England, who can console themselves that tuition fees won't have to be repaid until after graduation, are often taken aback at the separate cost of accommodation and living costs.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption There are growing calls in the US to reduce college costs, while England's fees are set to rise

Even for those painfully expensive private US universities, Ms Blumenthal says the headline figures can be misleading.

""Very few Americans pay the sticker price.

""US universities have a practice of discounting the admissions price. You get a letter saying congratulations, you're admitted to our university, and because you have financial aid, we're going to give this package of loans and scholarships.""

And she says many deals provide a guarantee of work on campus for students, to make it more affordable.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Hillary Clinton has campaigned to make college more affordable

But a spokesman for UCLAN says there are also bursaries for its students - with more than half of first years receiving up to 2,000.

""While there are aspects of the government's fees policy that continue to cause concern we are determined to work within it,"" said the UCLAN spokesman. And he said application figures showed students were not being deterred by cost.

Higher or lower?

But where are fees headed next? And perhaps that is the most striking contrast.

In England, the government has signalled that fees will move upwards above 9,000. Universities have already been pushing to be able to charge more.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Student protests were held against the raising of tuition fees to 9,000

But in the US, the argument has been in the opposite direction - about how costs can be cut. The level of student debt, above a trillion dollars and rising, is increasingly seen as unsustainable.

In the presidential elections, Democrat rivals have been competing to sound the toughest on making college more affordable.

Hillary Clinton is promising a ""New College Compact"" with financial support to help students.

Bernie Sanders has outbid her with the promise to make tuition entirely free in public universities, saying that if Germany can scrap fees, there is no reason why it wouldn't be practical in the United States.

""The middle class has no disposable income because of wage stagnation,"" says Ms Blumenthal.

Middle-class handouts

It means the classic American dream of sending the children to college is proving a financial nightmare.

""If you are a middle-class family and you have two or three children who are going to be in college at the same time, you are totally unable to pay for it.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The American dream of going to college is under financial pressure

""But your income might be such that you do not qualify for grants.""

Universities are now offering help to this squeezed middle, making no secret of who they are targeting.

The University of California, Berkeley, where fees for in-state students are $13,342 (9,400), has launched a ""Middle Class Access Plan"".

This offers financial support to families with a combined income of between $80,000 (57,000) and $150,000 (106,000), who might be income-rich but cash-poor.

Technology to cut costs

The top private universities are also aware of the need to hit the brakes on costs.

John Hennessy, president of Stanford University, told the BBC: ""The levels of debt cannot continue to go up at the rate that they've been going up.

""We're going to have to find a way to deal with that, whether it's income-based repayment or some other scheme.""

He suggests online technology could be the way to reduce costs, so perhaps students could spend part of their time studying online from home, with interactive video classes, as well as spending time on campus.

But he says students can be the most resistant to such changes, wanting no dilution of the complete university experience.

And while fees in England are, in effect, flat - with more or less all universities charging 9,000 - in the US they can have a completely counter-intuitive relationship with quality.

Research from the INSEAD business school in France showed that when US universities had a decline in rankings, they were more likely to increase rather than cut fees.

It was described as the ""Chivas Regal strategy"", in reference to the claim that the whisky brand increased its popularity and status by pushing up the price.

On average, US tuition fees had increased by 500% in real terms over the past three decades, the study found, without any link to improvements.

Of course, there is another huge difference between England's student costs and the US.

In England, fees do not have to be paid up-front. Repayments begin only when students are earning above an income threshold of 21,000 - and debts are written off after 30 years.

It's a system that has been backed by the OECD as an example of a long-term sustainable approach to university funding, which does not demand payment at the point of access.

And England is not the same as the rest of the UK, where Scotland has no fees and Wales and Northern Ireland charge about 3,800.

Pam Tatlow, chief executive of the Million+ group of new universities, says universities recognise the public concern, but the fees have replaced funding once received from government.

But she says the international examples show there is nothing inevitable about how students pay for university.

""I don't think anyone should think that the higher education funding system is set in stone.""

Ia mengatakan penanggung jawab izin harus bertanggung jawab terhadap kebakaran di lokasi mereka, apa pun penyebabnya.

Tapi dalam persidangan yang digelar hari Rabu (30/12) majelis hakim yang dipimpin Parlas Nababan menyatakan bahwa gugatan pemerintah ini ditolak karena bukti-bukti yang diajukan tidak kuat.

Em uma questao de semanas, o Airlander 10, a maior aeronave do mundo, fara seu primeiro voo de teste.

Uma estranha mistura de dirigivel, helicoptero e aviao, o veiculo decolara de Cardington, um vilarejo 70 km ao norte de Londres. O Airlander 10 tem 92 m de comprimento, 18 a mais que os maiores ""gigantes"" da aviacao comercial, o Airbus 380 e o Boeing 747-8.

Baseado originalmente em um projeto militar americano, o Airlander 10 saiu do papel gracas a empresa Hybrid Air Vehicles, que adaptou os planos para desenvolver o que chama de uma nova geracao de aeronaves silenciosas, energeticamente eficientes e que nao afetam o meio ambiente.

Autonomia

Segundo a empresa, a aeronave e 70% mais ""verde"" que um tipico aviao de carga, mas a grande vantagem e a versatilidade: o Airlander 10, alem de decolar verticalmente, pode pousar da mesma maneira em uma serie de superficies, inclusive a agua.

Isso poderia fazer dele um veiculo bastante util para transportar cargas para locais de dificil acesso, como zonas de desastres sem pistas de pouso. De acordo com o fabricante, o Airlander e capaz de suportar ventos de mais de 120 km/h quando esta ancorado no solo.

Com capacidade para transportar ate 10 toneladas de carga e 48 passageiros, o Airlander promete tambem autonomia maior que a concorrencia. Pode voar continuamente por ate cinco dias a uma velocidade de 148 km/h e pode ser controlado por controle remoto.

A aeronave contra com quatro motores movidos a diesel e uma estrutura inflada com gas helio, o que resulta em um peso de 20 toneladas, menos de 10% de um Airbus 380, por exemplo. E seus custos tambem sao uma fracao em comparacao com a concorrencia: cerca de US$ 11 milhoes - a maior parte deste valor veio de financiamentos do governo britanico e da Uniao Europeia, mas uma campanha de financiamento coletivo arrecadou mais de US$ 3,3 milhoes.

O Airlander conta com um charme especial por ter sido construido no Hangar 1, em Cardington, as mesmas instalacoes em que foi produzido o primeiro dirigivel do mundo, em 1918. Agora, a Hybrid Air Vehicles quer fabricar ate 2021, pelo menos 10 unidades por ano.

E isso inclui desafiar o que especialistas em transporte aereo classificam como um tabu da industria: em 1937, o mais famoso dirigivel da epoca, o Hindenburg, incendiou-se enquanto aterrissava em Nova Jersey, matando 35 pessoas.

""O desastre matou a industria"", escreveu o historiador John Swinfield.

Os 16 sobreviventes, integrantes de um time de rugbi, tiveram que se alimentar dos corpos para ter qualquer chance de aguentar ate o resgate, que demorou dois meses.

Em entrevista ao programa Victoria Derbyshire, da BBC, Canessa, que hoje e um bem-sucedido cardiologista, conta o drama que motivou a decisao.

Ele esta lancando um livro sobre o episodio, ainda sem edicao no Brasil, chamado I Had to Survive: How a Plane Crash in the Andes Inspired My Calling to Save Lives (""Eu tinha que sobreviver: como um acidente de aviao nos Andes inspirou minha vocacao para salvar vidas"", em traducao livre).

O episodio tambem inspirou o filme Vivos (1993), em que Canessa e interpretado pelo ator Josh Hamilton.

O resgate demorou dois meses. Canessa, que tinha 19 anos a epoca, caminhou com um colega por 11 dias ate encontrar pastores no pe da cordilheira.

O aviao caiu quando seguia de Montevideu para Santiago, em outubro de 1972. O piloto teve que fazer um pouso de emergencia em um vale apos uma forte turbulencia em meio a uma tempestade.

Pero aunque algunos dudan seriamente de la existencia de tal armamento, otros dicen que no se puede descartar su veracidad.

Image copyright Naciones Unidas Image caption El Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU ha sancionado varias veces al pais asiatico.

""Hay mucha controversia sobre si los misiles de Corea del Norte pueden llegar a territorio estadounidense, pero lo cierto es que cada vez mas se puede creer que el pais tiene la capacidad de crear ojivas nucleares miniaturizadas"", le dijo el analista surcoreano de asuntos militares Kim Jin-moo al Financial Times.

En los ultimos meses, el pais asiatico ha elevado su retorica belica en respuesta al aumento de las sanciones por parte de Naciones Unidas.

El Consejo de Seguridad tomo varias medidas contra Corea del Norte despues del ensayo nuclear de enero pasado y el lanzamiento de un satelite, hechos que ya violaban las sanciones previas.

En dias recientes, Pyongyang amenazo con lanzar un ataque nuclear indiscriminado contra Estados Unidos y Corea del Sur si continuaban con sus ejercicios militares anuales.

Cada ano se realizan ejercicios de entrenamiento entre los ejercitos de Corea de Sur y Estados Unidos (conocidos como Foal Eagle y Key Resolve), lo que siempre genera las protestas del gobierno de Corea de Norte.

Cuestionada

La declaracion del lider norcoreano fue realizada en medio de una inspeccion a una instalacion militar.

""Las ojivas nucleares han sido estandarizadas para que puedan ser instaladas en misiles balisticos, miniaturizandolas"", informo la agencia de noticias estatal KCNA basados en lo dicho por Kim Jong-un

Image copyright KCNA Image caption Kim Jong-un es ovacionado por soldados durante una reciente visita a una instalacion militar.

""Esto puede ser considerado como un verdadero disuasorio nuclear"", anadio.

La visita tambien incluyo la revision de las cabezas nucleares disenadas para reaccion termonuclear, que son utilizadas en las bombas de hidrogeno.

Si lo que dice Kim Jong-un es cierto y Corea del Norte puede instalar ojivas nucleares en sus misiles balisticos, representaria una seria amenaza para los paises vecinos e incluso para Estados Unidos.

En octubre de 2014, el comandante de las fuerzas de Estados Unidos en Corea del Sur, general Curtis Scaparrotti, le dijo a los medios que el creia que Corea del Norte tenia la capacidad de miniaturizar un dispositivo nuclear.

Y en mayo de 2015, el Comite Nacional de Corea del Norte senalo que el pais habia logrado la tecnologia para miniaturizar armas nucleares.

Pero ese logro ha sido seriamente cuestionado.

Expertos dudan incluso que el ensayo realizado en enero de este ano haya sido con una bomba de hidrogeno como afirmaba el gobierno de Corea del Norte.

Misiles balisticos

Pero que significa el anuncio realizado por Corea del Norte?

Image copyright Getty Image caption El ejercito de Corea del Norte es considerado el mayor en numero de hombres en el mundo.

El pasado mes de enero, el pais asiatico, considerado el mas hermetico del planeta, realizo una prueba con un cohete similar a los que utilizan las agencias espaciales para enviar sus satelites a orbita, lo que genero reacciones alrededor del mundo.

Hasta ese momento se desconocia si el ejercito de Pyongyang tenia armas suficientemente potentes para poder alcanzar el suelo estadounidense.

Y aunque el cohete lanzado el 8 de enero no tenia el alcance de un misil balistico intercontinental (ICBM) que puede viajar mas de 10.000 kilometros antes de caer, la noticia de la miniaturizacion de una ojiva nuclear genera bastante preocupacion.

Corea del Norte esta separado de las islas de Hawai (territorio estadounidense) por 7.500 kilometros y por 10.342 kilometros del centro de EE.UU.

""Corea del Norte nunca ha demostrado la capacidad para construir un vehiculo de reingreso que pueda sobrevivir al menos a la mitad de la velocidad que se requiere para un ICBM"", le dijo a la agencia AFP John Schilling, ingeniero aeroespacial y experto en sistemas de lanzamiento espacial de The Aerospace Corporation.

Image copyright Getty Image caption Solo Rusia, China y Estados Unidos poseen misiles balisticos intercontinentales. Francia e India se encuentran en fase de desarrollo.

""Cuando lleguen a hacerlo, y si es que llegan, lo que hoy en dia es una amenaza teorica se convertira en algo muy real y muy alarmante"", agrego.

Hasta ahora los unicos paises que poseen este tipo de misiles balisticos son Rusia, Estados Unidos y China, pero de acuerdo a los reportes de la Federacion Estadounidense de Cientificos, cualquier pais con tecnologia en el espacio podria desarrollar este tipo de misiles.

bbc.com,,"Ray Tomlinson's email is flawed, but never bettered","['North America Technology Reporter', 'Dave Lee']","Image copyright AP Image caption Ray Tomlinson is credited with inventing emails in 1971

The internet pioneer Ray Tomlinson has died, aged 74.

He is widely regarded as the inventor of email, and is credited with putting the now iconic ""@"" sign in the addresses of the revolutionary system.

He could never have imagined the multitude of ways email would come to be used, abused and confused.

Just think - right now, someone, somewhere is writing an email she should probably reconsider. Count to 10, my friend. Sleep on it.

Another is sending an email containing brutal, heartbreaking words that, really, should be said in person... if only he had the nerve.

And of course, a Nigerian prince is considering how best to ask for my help in spending his fortune.

Email does curious things to us. We worry about getting emails, we worry about not getting emails.

Before joining the BBC, I'd live by the popular freelancer's mantra that a watched inbox never fills, so I'd go for a walk in the hope of returning to offers of work.

Image copyright Thinkstock

Now I'm desperate for ""inbox zero"".

Email became part of everyday life so quickly we didn't have enough time to learn how to properly use it - until there was no turning back, and bad habits were set in stone.

To make things worse, the Blackberry brought email away from our computers and into our palms - and therefore our bedrooms, our commutes and our toilet breaks.

In doing so, we willingly let email seep into our lives, instigating an anxiety we'd not yet encountered. One study in 2014 took email away from 13 US government workers. The result? Their average heart-rates decreased.

And that's because for anyone with any kind of office job, the temptation - or perhaps pressure - to be on top of your emails can be overwhelming.

In France, there have even been calls to enforce some kind of ""digital work hour"" restriction, because checking your email after work is, after all, free labour.

The first email

Below is an extract from Ray Tomlinson's account of how he created email:

I am frequently asked why I chose the at sign, but the at sign just makes sense.

The purpose of the at sign (in English) was to indicate a unit price (for example, 10 items @ $1.95). I used the at sign to indicate that the user was ""at"" some other host rather than being local.

The first message was sent between two machines that were literally side by side. The only physical connection they had (aside from the floor they sat on) was through the Arpanet.

I sent a number of test messages to myself from one machine to the other. The test messages were entirely forgettable and I have, therefore, forgotten them.

Most likely the first message was QWERTYUIOP or something similar. When I was satisfied that the program seemed to work, I sent a message to the rest of my group explaining how to send messages over the network.

The first use of network email announced its own existence.

'Completely forgettable'

Yet, for all its faults, we've still not found anything better.

Which is why, as the technology world mourns the loss of Ray Tomlinson, it's only right to spend a moment to appreciate what a remarkable contribution he made to the business of communication.

He's credited as sending the first email as we know it today - and commandeering the @ symbol as a way to simplify how it works.

The first messages were sent between computers that were a mere 10 feet apart, but the feat was enormous.

For something so groundbreaking, it was adorably anti-climactic. Just read how he described it during an interview in 2009.

Image copyright Slack Image caption Sites like Slack want to replace emails - even if just internally

""Every time you test you have to generate some sort of message.

""You might drag your fingers across the keyboard or just type the opening phrase from Lincoln's Gettysburg address or something else - so technically the first email is completely forgettable and therefore forgotten.""

In the following decades, the @ sign has gone from being a barely-used character to one we use multiple times a day. As NPR put it, Mr Tomlinson changed @ from a symbol into an icon.

Yes there's spam. Yes there's phishing attacks. Yes there's work mailing lists that ding constantly, or ""reply all"" fiascos.

But email itself has never been the problem, just the people that use it.

Post-email

That said, one hopes email is replaced one day. It's widely accepted that it's not an efficient communication method, and disrupts the focus of anyone trying to get things done.

But what could possibly come next?

Image copyright Facebook Image caption Facebook At Work is being trialled by several companies - but could be broadened out soon

In the past year we've seen companies like Slack try and reinvent workplace communication, but while such tools are great for chatting internally, it does little to improve talking to those who work outside of your company.

In its quest for world domination, Facebook has long wanted us to ditch using email and instead shift over to using the Facebook inbox.

But I don't know about you, my Facebook inbox is one of the few safe spaces I have on the internet: an area where work does not overflow into my personal life. I'd like to keep it that way.

Soon, we're expecting Facebook will expand its Facebook At Work service, offering it to all businesses around the world. It's being trialled by a selection of firms, including the likes of RBS and Heineken. The idea is that communication tools we're all familiar with when talking to our friends can surely help us chat at work. Minus the cat videos.

If Facebook provides a way to separate work life from personal life, then great. Like Slack, it seems to work best when talking to people you already work with. If the rest of it just becomes a place to send and receive messages in chronological order... that's just an email inbox in disguise.

And we're back to where Ray Tomlinson started in 1971. 1971! This is an industry that moves quicker than any other, where start-ups come and go in a matter of weeks.

And yet Mr Tomlinson's innovation has endured for 45 years - and shows no sign of going anywhere yet.

bbc.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,The world's most extreme dog sled patrol,['Kara Segedin'],"It has to be the most unusual job in all of the military: Arctic dog sled patrol.

Wildlife photographer Morten Hilmer was a member of Sldepatruljen Sirius (Sirius Sled Patrol), Denmarks elite navy dog sled unit that patrols the coast of Greenland from Northeast Greenland National Park (the world's largest and most northerly national park) down to the small town of Ittoqqortoormiit.

This area is like a combination of a huge, huge ice desert and a very cold fridge, says Hilmer.

Speaking to the BBC World Service, Hilmer describes the breathtaking beauty, extreme loneliness and isolation of living in, and photographing, this unique corner of the world.

While most young men join the patrol in search of the ultimate adventure, Hilmer was drawn to its unique photographic possibilities.

I love nature photography and I was really, really fascinated about the fact you have this huge area untamed by man, he says.

A member of the International League of Conservation Photographers, Hilmer always pays careful attention to the welfare of his wild subjects.

If you drive too close to a polar bear you put yourself in danger and the polar bear in danger, he says.

Hilmer spent two years and two months with the patrol. The two-man dog teams have a rotating roster with one member who has been there a year and another joining for the first time.

When he first began working with the dogs, Hilmer says they didnt listen to him at all. But two years later: I could drive them almost like I ride my bicycle at home.

Patrols usually last for four months, often without any human contact outside the pair.

After two months in the wilderness, Hilmer says your mind runs out of things to think about. So you begin to save any interesting thoughts for the long days travelling on the sled.

Some days were just really, really, really boring and you just want to go home to your family and friends and have a nice cup of coffee and a warm blanket.

Despite craving the comforts of home, when his tour was up in August, Hilmer was back in Greenland by November and hed soon found a job as a chef with the National Park weather station  despite not having any cooking qualifications.",[]

bbc.com,,Aung San Suu Kyi: Power not presidency in Myanmar,"['Myanmar Correspondent', 'Jonah Fisher']","Image copyright EPA Image caption Aung San Suu Kyi has tightened her grip on power in Myanmar

The chances of Aung San Suu Kyi becoming Myanmar's next president have been receding for months.

But as parliament puts forward its nominations for the top job, the situation is clear: there will be no last-minute deal, no President Suu Kyi.

Those expecting a Nelson Mandela ending to this incredible story will be disappointed. But for Suu Kyi and her many supporters little has actually been lost.

This anticlimactic outcome strengthens her politically and diminishes the military in the eyes of the Burmese people.

The generals' inflexibility, in the face of a huge popular mandate, has set the tone for what looks likely to be a period of confrontation between them and the newly elected democrats.

It was in November last year that Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), swept the board in the long-awaited general election.

The NLD won nearly 80% of the contested seats and everyone, even the army, agreed that the Burmese people had not just voted for change, they had voted for Suu Kyi to lead.

Emboldened by the result, the former political prisoner reached out to her long-time adversaries. In the past four months she has held three meetings with Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing. Suu Kyi was exploring the possibility of a grand deal.

What the NLD leader needed was the army's approval for a legally dubious move. She wanted parliament to temporarily suspend the part of the constitution that bars her from becoming president.

Clause 59F famously disqualifies anyone whose spouse, children, and even spouses of children, have foreign passports. Suu Kyi's two children by Oxford academic Michael Aris are British.

Supporters of the clause say it protects the country's sovereignty, but many believe it was drafted by the military to close the door on Suu Kyi. To open that door, the Burmese army would have demanded concessions.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Suu Kyi met Myanmar's senior general Min Aung Hlaing to try to strike a deal

That could have meant giving the military the right to choose the chief ministers of several states, and securing promises that the army's many business interests would be left alone.

Most importantly, the military is almost certain to have insisted that attempts to chip away at its political power be put on the back burner.

So beneath the feel-good headline of ""President Suu Kyi"", the army would have consolidated its political role.

It's not clear why the grand deal didn't happen. Perhaps the army just couldn't stomach the idea, or maybe Suu Kyi refused to concede enough. For whatever reason, the talks broke down.

New landscape

So what, then, will the new political landscape look like?

Suu Kyi famously said before the election that she would be ""above"" whoever she picks to be president.

It is clear that her choice has been selected primarily for their loyalty and obedience. All Suu Kyi will have to do is pick up a phone to flex her presidential power by proxy. She has lost nothing there.

Unencumbered by any deal with the army, Suu Kyi will be freer to pursue her campaign platform from the 2015 election.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Myanmar nationalists have demonstrated against Suu Kyi becoming president

Her authority is unchallenged within her party and she will now remotely command both presidency and parliament. One of her priorities is likely to be a renewed bid to change the constitution to reduce the army's power.

The unelected army representatives have already sampled the new order. Suu Kyi's MPs are demanding that deals made by the army and the former government be re-examined.

In a rare moment of drama, all the men in green uniform stood up in the house in protest.

In the immediate aftermath of the election, Suu Kyi spoke of being inclusive and creating a government of national unity. That was before the army rejected her overtures.

It is expected that the government Suu Kyi leads will be a mix of NLD officials and technocrats. But will she now be in the mood to find room for those from the military party, the USDP? Quite possibly not.

The 2008 constitution will be the main limit on Suu Kyi's power. Drafted by the generals, and approved in a sham referendum, it ensures the military retains its political role.

The key security ministries (home, defence, border affairs) are appointed not by the president but by the army commander-in-chief.

A quarter of the seats in parliament are also reserved for soldiers. That is not enough for them to block legislation, but sufficient to scupper any attempts to amend their constitution.

Much has changed in Myanmar, but the Burmese army has not budged one inch from the red lines it put into the constitution.

The democratic experiment, economic reforms and the emboldened Suu Kyi remain in a controlled space that the military designed and now seem intent on preserving.

Image copyright AP Image caption Suu Kyi (centre) was a toddler when her father was assassinated

Aung San Suu Kyi:

Daughter of Myanmar's independence hero, Gen Aung San, assassinated in July 1947 when Suu Kyi was only two.

From 1964, studied philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford University, where she met her future husband, academic Michael Aris.

Returned to Rangoon in 1988 to look after her critically ill mother during the midst of a campaign for democratic reform.

Organised rallies and travelled around the country, calling for peaceful democratic reform and free elections.

Demonstrations brutally suppressed by the army, which seized power in a coup in September 1988, placing Suu Kyi under house arrest the following year.

Her party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), won a national election in 1990 - but the junta refused to relinquish power.

Suu Kyi spent protracted periods under house arrest until she was finally released unconditionally in 2010.

Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.

Led the NLD to a majority win in Myanmar's first openly contested election in 25 years in November 2015.

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,'Desagradaveis e ardilosos': o lado obscuro dos golfinhos,"['Bbc Earth', 'Henry Nicholls']","Image copyright naturepl.com Image caption Golfinhos nariz-de-garrafa sao inteligentes, mas tambem podem ser bem malvados...

Golfinhos tem a reputacao de serem mamiferos fofinhos, inteligentes e amigaveis. Tudo isso e verdade, mas pouca gente sabe que os cetaceos tambem tem um lado obscuro, marcado por assedio sexual, incesto e infanticidio.

Todo mundo que ja viu golfinhos fazendo truques esta a par de seu potencial, e ha um imenso volume de estudos evidenciando a inteligencia desses animais. A maioria deles foca na mais comum especie de golfinho - o nariz de garrafa.

Em um classico estudo, publicado em 1984, pesquisadores treinaram um femea chamada Akeakamai para imitar sons gerados por computador. As respostas de Akeakamai foram extremamente similares. Biologos, entao, comecaram a relacionar os sons a objetos como argola, cano, cachimbo e bola. Akeakamai rapidamente descobriu a conexao e passou a fazer o som apropriado para cada objeto.

'Ardilosos'

Ou seja, a golfinho tinha aprendido um novo vocabulario.

Golfinhos selvagens alcancam facanhas similares. Cada um tem seu proprio assovio, o que funciona como nome. Quando pesquisadores produziram versoes sinteticas desses assovios, os golfinhos responderam como se soubessem que estavam sendo chamados.

Os cetaceos tambem reconhecem uns aos outros. Um estudo de 2013 revelou que golfinhos em cativeiro durante muitos anos, ou mesmo decadas, lembram os assovios. Em um caso, uma femea chamada Allie, vivendo no Brookfield Zoo, em Chicago, reagiu a uma gravacao com os assovios de Bailey, um golfinho que nao via ha 20 anos.

Image copyright naturepl.com Image caption Golfinhos sao alguns dos mamiferos mais inteligentes

Mais impressionante ainda foi o caso de dois golfinhos nariz de garrafa que, em 2001, passaram no ""teste do espelho"": cientistas usaram um hidrocor temporario e atoxico em golfinhos que depois se estudaram em frente a espelhos. Isso sugere que eles eram capazes de se reconhecer. Algo que poucas especies de animais conseguem.

Essa inteligencia pode ter contribuido para uma especie de ""culto ao golfinho"". Mas estudos ja revelaram um outro lado desses animais. Um lado bem menos ""fofinho"" e menos parecido com a serie de TV Flipper.

""Golfinhos sao muito inteligentes, mas assim como humanos podem ser desagradaveis e ardilosos"", diz Richard Connor, da Universidade de Massachusetts e codiretor da ONG Dolphin Research Alliance.

Quando chega a epoca de acasalamento, golfinhos machos competem arduamente pelas femeas. Nos anos 80, Connor e seus colegas foram os primeiros a documentar golfinhos nariz de garrafa ""assediando"" coletivamente femeas em Shark Bay, na Australia.

""Um evento deste tipo comeca quando dois ou tres machos tentam capturar uma femea"", escreveu Connor, em um estudo de 1992. ""Os machos investem contra ela. Em uma perseguicao, a agressividade se manteve por quase uma hora e meia e os golfinhos percorreram 7km"".

Outras observacoes mostraram que machos podiam formar grupos de ate 14 golfinhos.

Image copyright naturepl.com Image caption Golfinho femea com o filhote

Tambem esta claro que femeas nao participavam da perseguicao por vontade propria. ""As agressoes incluiam golpes de cauda, testadas, mordidas e encontroes"", acrescentou Connor no estudo de 1992.

Apenas em uma de cada quatro perseguicoes as femeas conseguiram escapar. ""Durante um ano, femeas serao cercadas por uma serie de grupos de machos"".

Os esforcos de fuga podem ser justificados por outra verdade sinistra sobre golfinhos: em 1996 e 97, os corpos de filhotes de 37 golfinhos nariz de garrafa apareceram em praias do Estado americano da Virginia. A primeira vista, nada parecia errado, mas uma autopsia encontrou evidencia de traumatismos severos.

Os ferimentos internos se concentravam na regiao da cabeca e do peito, sem falar em laceracoes em orgaos e fraturas em costelas.

Havia varias evidencias do envolvimento de golfinhos adultos, em especial testemunhos de pesquisadores sobre incidentes batizados de ""lancamentos de filhotes"" por parte de golfinhos. Biologos suspeitam que o que parece uma brincadeira pode ser tambem uma forma de machos adultos tentarem matar filhotes para que as maes voltem a ficar no cio.

Image copyright naturepl.com Image caption Machos matam filhotes, possivelmente para que femeas voltem a procriar

Em 2013, cientistas testemunharam um ataque de adultos a um filhote recem-nascido, que conseguiu escapar.

Ha ainda outra surpresa ligada ao acasalamento de golfinhos: um estudo de 2004 que investigou a paternidade na comunidade de Shark Bay revelou que golfinhos ocasionalmente praticam incesto. Um macho, chamado BJA, virou pai em 1978, mas em 1993 acasalou com a propria filha.

""Ja vimos machos cercando suas proprias maes"", conta Connor. E um estudo de 2010 confirmou que a taxa de filhotes nascidos por endogamia em Shark Bay e maior do que a esperada pelo acaso.

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,Por que Washington tiene en la mira a los latinoamericanos que compran mansiones en efectivo en Miami,"['Bbc Mundo', 'Redacci N']","Image copyright ThinkStopck Image caption Miami es una de las ciudades mas apetecidas por turistas e inversores extranjeros. (Foto de archivo)

Miami lleva decadas con una reputacion de ser destino de dineros mal habidos procedentes, fundamentalmente, de America Latina.

Y una formula clasica para el lavado de dinero es la compra de vivienda, a veces en efectivo y en muchas ocasiones usando mecanismos legales para ocultar la identidad del comprador.

Por lo que ha causado interes una nueva norma del gobierno de Estados Unidos que acaba de entrar en vigencia, destinada precisamente a combatir el fenomeno.

Aunque algunos advierten que, en ciertos casos, pueden terminar pagando justos por pecadores.

Desde el pasado 1 de marzo, el gobierno estadounidense exige que se reporten a las autoridades mas datos de cualquier transaccion de vivienda en efectivo llevada a cabo en la ciudad de Miami por valor superior a US$1 millon.

Los nuevos requerimientos, que tendran una vigencia inicial de seis meses, impiden que se completen esos negocios mediante el uso de empresas anonimas, sin revelar antes quien es el dueno real de las propiedades.

""Estamos buscando entender el riesgo de que funcionarios extranjeros corruptos o criminales transnacionales esten usando vivienda estadounidense de lujo para invertir secretamente millones de dineros sucios"", dijo en un comunicadoJennifer Shasky Calvery, directora de Fincen del Departamento del Tesoro, el organo creado por el gobierno de hacer seguimiento a esas transacciones.

Y si bien el lenguaje de la medida no designa especificamente a nacionales de paises latinoamericanos, su preponderancia en el mercado inmobiliario de Miami deja en claro el impacto que tendra sobre esos compradores.

Miami y Nueva York

La medida solo estara vigente en dos ciudades estadounidenses, Miami y Nueva York.

Pues ellas acaparan la atencion de inversionistas extranjeros deseosos de dejar su dinero en Estados Unidos.

Miami, en particular, es el reino de las transacciones inmobiliarias en efectivo.

Image caption Los extranjeros compran muchas de las viviendas de lujo en Miami.

Un estudio de la firma inmobiliaria Zillow asegura que es la ciudad en Estados Unidos donde mas se da esta modalidad del negocio. Un sorprendente 55% de todas las transacciones de vivienda en el segundo trimestre de 2015 fueron pagadas en efectivo.

Y es indiscutible el peso que tienen los extranjeros en el mercado de vivienda de esta ciudad.

Se estima que los extranjeros compraron en Miami 10.600 viviendas en 2015, por un valor total de cerca de US$6.100 millones, de acuerdo a una evaluacion de la Asociacion Nacional de Agentes Inmobiliarios.

El mismo estudio revela que cerca de 36% del valor de todas las compras inmobiliarias en Miami es atribuible a compradores extranjeros.

Y estima que cuatro de los cinco principales paises de origen de los compradores son latinoamericanos: Venezuela, Brasil, Argentina y Colombia. El unico por fuera de la region es Canada.

13% de los compradores internacionales en 2015 venian de Venezuela, indica el estudio, mientras que 12% venian de Brasil. Los siguen con 10% cada uno argentinos y colombianos.

Impacto sobre el resto?

Lo que algunos se preguntan es si los nuevos controles gubernamentales orientados a atacar el lavado de dolares puedan perjudicar al resto del mercado.

Image caption Cerca del 15% de las compras de casas por extranjeros en Miami corresponden a viviendas de mas de US$1 millon.

Al fin y al cabo, muchos de los inversores provenientes de America Latina son familias de clase media en busca de encontrar un refugio para su dinero lejos de la inflacion, la inestabilidad y la inseguridad que caracteriza a muchas de sus naciones.

Y por supuesto, muchisimas fortunas perfectamente legales que buscan invertir en el atractivo estilo de vida que ofrece la ciudad estadounidense.

En realidad, las nuevas disposiciones contra el lavado se aplicaran solo a compras de vivienda de lujo.

Solo el 14% de todos los clientes internacionales en Miami compran casas de mas de US$1 millon, algunas de las cuales serian eventualmente cobijadas por las nuevas medidas de control gubernamental, segun indica el estudio de los agentes inmobiliarios.

Efecto a largo plazo

No obstante hay quienes temen que el efecto cumulativo de mas controles de las autoridades disminuya la vitalidad del que ha sido uno de los mercados de vivienda mas dinamicos del pais en los ultimos anos.

Image copyright AP Image caption Miami tambien ha sufrido un impacto por la devaluacion de varias monedas latinoamericanas.

""Por el momento no se nota que las medidas hayan tenido un efecto negativo en el mercado"", le dice a BBC Mundo la agente inmobiliaria Mercedes Guinot, quien senala en cambio que es mucho mas fuerte el golpe que ha recibido su industria por la devaluacion de varias monedas latinoamericanas, lo que ha vuelto mas cara la vivienda en Miami para compradores de la region.

Pero el efecto se puede sentir mas adelante.

""La nueva directiva del Departamento del Tesoro podria ser un punto de inflexion, si se hace permanente, para el mercado de vivienda de lujo de Miami que esta basado en inversion extranjera, dominada en epocas recientes por compradores en efectivo"", le dice a BBC Mundo Peter Zalewski, experto analista del mercado inmobiliario en la ciudad, asociado a la firma Condo Vultures.

Zalewski tambien opina que para que la medida tenga efecto contra los capitales ilicitos, debe expandirse tambien a ciudades contiguas a Miami como Fort Lauderdale y Boca Raton, otras favoritas de compradores extranjeros y que actualmente no estan cobijadas por los controles.

En el pasado, uno de los atractivos de esta metropolis para los inversionistas latinoamericanos radicaba en la discrecion que ofrecia a los interesados en depositar sus fortunas alla.

Esta claro que eso esta cambiando. La gente que quiera tener una mansion en la llamada ""Capital del Sol"", tendra que estar dispuesta a contestar mas preguntas acerca de donde salio el dinero.",[]

bbc.com,,The lullaby that brought a prime minister to tears,"['Ashley Donnelly', 'Bbc News']","Media caption Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull cried during an interview

Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was recently filmed wiping tears from his eyes as he told the story of an Aboriginal mother singing a lullaby to her child.

""The thing that's so sad is to imagine that mother singing that story to her at a time when you were losing culture and the last thing that baby was, was safe,"" Mr Turnbull told indigenous journalist Stan Grant.

A teary eyed prime minister makes for easy news copy, and the video quickly spread across websites and social media.

But the story of this lullaby is not as simple as it first seems, and in fact, it's one of many clues helping to revitalise a language.

'Black Maria'

Tyronne Bell and Glen Freeman are from the Ngunawal people, the traditional owners of the land on which Canberra's Parliament House stands.

The cousins, who once helped Mr Turnbull prepare a speech in Ngunawal, were the source of the story, the prime minister's office confirmed.

Mr Bell said Mr Turnbull was referring to an enigmatic figure named ""Black Maria"", a Ngunawal woman who lived in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales in the 1800s.

In 1930, the Moss Vale Post newspaper interviewed a very old woman who remembered listening to Black Maria's singing as a child.

Image copyright Prime Minister's Department Image caption From left to right: Tyronne Bell, his son Jai, Prime Minister Turnbull and Glen Freeman

""Black Maria, as she was called by the whites, possessed a very attractive voice and seated on the ground she often entertained the white children with lullabies, beating time with two sticks,"" the article said.

Four lines, purportedly from Maria's favourite song, were transcribed phonetically into the article. Mr Bell said these lines did not make sense in Ngunawal, as the people who transcribed them did not understand the language.

Image copyright Supplied by Tyronne Bell Image caption The Moss Vale Post clipping from 1930 that includes the story of Black Maria and the lullaby

The story is further complicated by the identity of the woman who recalled Black Maria's lullaby. Mr Turnbull, it appears, made the assumption she was Black Maria's daughter, but this is not mentioned in the newspaper article. It's entirely possible that she was one of the white children who listened to Maria's songs.

Mununja the butterfly

What we do know is that Maria's alluring voice still resonates almost two centuries later.

Although the meaning of the original lullaby cannot be discerned, those four lines of inaccurately transcribed text helped inspire Mr Bell's late father to publish a book in the Ngunawal language, based on the legend of Mununja the Butterfly.

It is a love story about a young girl who escaped marriage to the evil Gunga and stayed close to her family and country forever under the protection of a beautiful butterfly, Mununja.

Mr Bell's father envisioned that the book, which included the Black Maria story as source material, could be used in schools to lift awareness of the language.

Image copyright @ImMylesMorgan Image caption A photograph of the Ngunawal story taken by NITV journalist Myles Morgan

In the 1800s, Aboriginal people were displaced by increasing British colonisation were moved to missions. They were often forbidden from speaking their mother tongue or following cultural traditions, meaning many cultures were lost forever.

But now, even elders are learning their language ""from scratch"". Mr Bell, Mr Freeman and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (ATSIS) launched a pilot project to teach Ngunawal two years ago.

Mr Bell and Mr Freeman started their project after a list of 30 words in Ngunawal was found two years ago. Since news of the project travelled to others in the Ngunawal community, they have collected more than 300 words.

There is increasing awareness of the importance of protecting indigenous languages. When he made his address to parliament in Ngunawal, Mr Turnbull announced A$20m ($14.8m; 10.5m) in funding for language preservation programs.

Dr Marcus Woolombi Waters, a sociology lecturer at Griffith University, is of the Kamilaroi people. He says embracing indigenous languages is not only vital for Aboriginal identity and belonging, but can help create much-needed understand for non-Indigenous Australians.

""That's not just healing Aboriginal people, that's letting Australians become inclusive in thousands of years of connections themselves,"" Dr Waters said.",[]

Sir George Martin's Caribbean legacy

A carpenter's son from Holloway in north London, Sir George helped The Beatles achieve global success as the head of the Parlophone record label after hearing their demo tape in 1962.

He took them from their mop-top pop recordings of the early 1960s to the psychedelia of Sergeant Pepper.

Analysis

By Mark Savage, BBC Music reporter

Without George Martin, The Beatles would have been a very different band.

His calm demeanour and technical expertise allowed the band to experiment and indulge in their wildest and most elaborate ideas. On many occasions, Lennon and McCartney would entrust him with arranging their songs - the string quartet on Yesterday is all his work, while he plays the piano solo on Misery.

Famously, Martin walked out of the band's first recording session at Abbey Road, leaving his engineers to supervise the recording of Besame Mucho while he went to the canteen.

But when the group started playing Love Me Do, a tape operator was despatched to fetch him. It was the start of the most productive producer-musician relationship in modern pop - although The Beatles weren't quite ready to accept this suave Londoner to their inner circle.

As the recording session finished, Martin asked if there was anything the band didn't like. ""Well, for a start,"" replied George Harrison, ""I don't like your tie.""

Luckily, he saw the funny side - and together the quintet rewrote the rule book on popular music.

After The Beatles disbanded, Martin wrote film scores and worked with artists as varied as Sting, Jose Carreras, Celine Dion and Stan Getz.

In 1997, he produced Elton John's re-write of Candle in the Wind, which went on to become the biggest-selling single of all time.

Despite beginning his career as an oboist, the classically-trained producer never regretted making his name in the mass market.

""Rock and roll has the same function as classical music,"" he once said. ""To make sounds that are appealing to a mass of people and are of some worth.""

'A little bit posh'

Of his reputation as the ""toff"" guiding the working-class Beatles to fame, Sir George said: ""I've been cast in the role of schoolmaster, the toff, the better-educated, and they've been the urchins that I've shaped.

""It's a load of poppycock, really, because our backgrounds were very similar. Paul and John went to quite good schools. We didn't pay to go to school, my parents were very poor. Again, I wasn't taught music and they weren't, we taught ourselves.

""As for the posh bit, you can't really go through the Royal Navy without getting a little bit posh. You can't be like a rock 'n' roll idiot throwing soup around in the wardroom.""

Media caption John Lennon: ""He had a very great musical knowledge and background so he could translate for us""

In his lifetime, he won multiple Grammy awards and an Academy Award for the score to A Hard Day's Night.

Sir George received a knighthood in 1996 and in 1999 he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Starr, 75, wrote: ""God bless George Martin peace and love to Judy and his family love Ringo and Barbara. George will be missed.""

In a second message, he added: ""Thank you for all your love and kindness George peace and love.""

Sir George's son, Giles Martin, tweeted: ""RIP dad. I love you. I'm so proud to have been your son. I'll miss you more than words can say. Thank you for the all times we had together.""

BBC Arts editor Will Gompertz described Sir George as ""a visionary"".

""The Beatles were like an orchestra without a conductor, until George Martin came along and found them,"" he said

""He had the most magnificent set of ears, as well as a wonderful personality. He was a calm, gentle, kind man with an amazing intelligence and fantastic creativity.""

Image copyright Sean Ono Lennon/Instagram Image caption Sean Ono Lennon was among those to pay tribute to Martin

Sean Ono Lennon posted a picture of Sir George on Instagram, writing: ""R.I.P. George Martin. I'm so gutted I don't have many words. Thinking of Judy and Giles and family. Love Always, Sean.""

Prime Minister David Cameron wrote: ""Sir George Martin was a giant of music - working with the Fab Four to create the world's most enduring pop music.""

Ray Connolly, a writer who interviewed The Beatles many times and worked on a documentary series with George Martin, described the ""happy relationship"" between The Beatles and Sir George.

""He was lovely to work with, he was so helpful, like a teacher actually - that's why The Beatles got on with him. He was so encouraging and helpful,"" he said.

George Martin awards and successes 205 commercially-released Beatles tracks were produced by George Martin 37 million copies sold of Candle in the Wind - which he co-produced with Sir Elton John in 1997 6 Grammy awards

BBC Radio 1 presenter Annie Nightingale, who met Sir George many times, said he influenced the band ""immensely"".

""He had incredible classical knowledge, and he was able to bring that into their repertoire without them thinking that it was old hat and stuffy.""

She added: ""He spoke very beautifully and had this incredible sense of humour, and that's I think what helped cement that magic between The Beatles and him.

""The Beatles had been turned down by every other label until George Martin saw their potential. I quote this all the time to people, to never be put off by not succeeding early on, because that's what happened to The Beatles.""

Media caption In a 2011 Arena programme, Sir George Martin spoke about the recording techniques he used with The Beatles

Neil Portnow, president and chief executive of The Recording Academy, paid tribute to the six-time Grammy winner.

""Having worked on hundreds of recordings, he was one of the most innovative producers of all time and his impact on music is unparalleled,"" he said.

""Our creative community has lost a gifted artist, and our thoughts go out to his family, his friends, and the many musicians with whom he collaborated.""

Among his many projects was the soundtrack to the eighth James Bond film Live and Let Die.

Sir Roger Moore wrote: ""How very sad to wake to the news Sir George Martin has left us. He made my first Bond film sound brilliant!""

Liam Gallagher, lead singer of rock band Oasis, who modelled themselves on The Beatles, said on Twitter: ""Sir George Martin RIP LG X""

Musician Lenny Kravitz wrote: ""The legends are really going home! Visionary producer of #TheBeatles, George Martin (1926-2016).""",[]

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,Mengapa orang Inggris sering mengatakan 'sorry' atau maaf?,['Linda Geddes'],"Image copyright Allison Turrell Flickr CC BY NC ND 2.0 Image caption Sorry atau maaf, kata yang paling sering diucapkan orang Inggris.

Ini merupakan kata yang mungkin paling banyak digunakan di Kerajaan Inggris Raya: apakah 'sorry' karena cuaca buruk, atau 'sorry' karena seseorang menabrak mereka, kemungkinannya orang Inggris rata-rata mengucapkan paling tidak satu kata permintaan maaf dalam satu jam atau dua jam terakhir.

Sebuah survei terbaru terhadap lebih dari 1.000 orang Inggris menemukan bahwa rata-rata orang mengucapkan maaf sekitar delapan kali per hari  dan satu dari delapan orang meminta maaf hampir 20 kali sehari.

Kesiapan orang Inggris untuk meminta maaf atas sesuatu yang tidak mereka lakukan memang luar biasa, dan hal ini diimbangi dengan ketidakmauan untuk meminta maaf atas apa yang mereka telah lakukan, tulis Henry Hitchings dalam tulisannya yang berjudul sangat tepat: Sorry!: The English and their Manners (Maaf! Orang Inggris dan Perilaku Mereka).

Ada spekulasi bahwa orang Kanada dan orang Inggris meminta maaf lebih sering daripada orang Amerika. Tetapi sulit untuk mempelajarinya dengan cara sedemikian rupa sehingga dapat memberikan bukti yang kuat."" Karina Schumann

Tetapi apakah orang Inggris memang meminta maaf lebih sering daripada orang dari budaya lainnya? Jika memang benar, apa alasan kebiasaan istimewa ini... dan seberapa buruknya hal ini sebagai sebuah kebiasaan?

Mendapatkan data yang bisa diandalkan mengenai seberapa sering orang meminta maaf di negara lain tidaklah semudah yang dibayangkan. Ada spekulasi bahwa orang Kanada dan orang Inggris meminta maaf lebih sering daripada orang Amerika. Tetapi sulit untuk mempelajarinya dengan cara sedemikian rupa sehingga dapat memberikan bukti yang kuat,"" kata Karina Schumann, seorang psikolog di Universitas Pittsburgh yang mempelajari permintaan maaf dan pengampunan.

Image copyright iStock Image caption Sulit untuk mempelajari penggunaan kata maaf dalam cara yang dapat memberikan bukti kuat.

Salah satu pendekatannya adalah menanyakan kepada orang-orang apa yang akan mereka lakukan jika mereka berada dalam situasi teoritis. Sebagai contoh, sebuah jajak pendapat YouGov baru-baru ini terhadap lebih dari 1.600 orang Inggris dan 1.000 orang Amerika mengungkapkan bahwa akan ada kira-kira 15 pernyataan maaf dari orang Inggris untuk setiap 10 pernyataan maaf dari orang Amerika jika mereka bersin, jika mereka mengoreksi kesalahan orang lain, atau jika mereka ditabrak orang lain.

Namun survei ini menemukan persamaan juga di antara responden Inggris dan Amerika: hanya sekitar tiga perempat orang dari kedua negara akan mengatakan maaf karena menginterupsi seseorang. Dan 84% orang Inggris akan meminta maaf karena datang terlambat ke sebuah pertemuan, dibandingkan 74% orang Amerika.

Namun, menanyakan seseorang mengenai apa yang akan mereka lakukan dalam situasi teoritis sangat berbeda dengan mengukur apa yang mereka lakukan dalam kehidupan nyata. Ambil contoh terbaru ini; dalam survei YouGov, 36% responden Inggris mengatakan mereka akan meminta maaf untuk kekikukan orang lain, dibandingkan 24% orang Amerika.

Dalam bukunya yang berjudul Watching the English, antropolog sosial Kate Fox menggambarkan eksperimennya untuk sengaja menabrak ratusan orang di kota-kota di seluruh Inggris. Ia juga mendorong para rekan kerjanya untuk melakukan hal yang sama di luar negeri untuk membuat perbandingan.

Fox menemukan bahwa sekitar 80% korban orang Inggris mengucapkan maaf, meskipun tabrakan itu jelas kesalahan Fox. Sering kali ucapan permintaan maaf diucapkan dengan tidak jelas, dan mungkin juga orang mengatakannya tanpa menyadarinya. Ketika dibandingkan dengan wisatawan dari luar negeri yang juga sengaja ditabrak, perbedaannya jelas. Hanya orang Jepang yang kelihatannya memiliki sesuatu yang mendekati refleksi orang Inggris dalam mengucapkan kata maaf, kata Fox dalam bukunya.

Hanya orang Jepang yang kelihatannya memiliki sesuatu yang mendekati refleksi orang Inggris dalam mengucapkan kata maaf."" Kate Fox

Asal usul kata sorry dapat ditelusuri pada kata dari bahasa Inggris Kuno sarig yang berarti stres, berduka atau penuh kesedihan, tetapi tentu saja, kebanyakan orang Inggris menggunakan kata ini dengan lebih santai. Dan di situlah masalahnya mempelajari budaya yang berbeda-beda dalam bahasa. Kita menggunakan kata sorry dalam cara yang berbeda-beda, kata Edwin Battistella, pakar linguistik dari Universitas Southern Oregon dan pengarang buku Sorry About That: The Language of Public Apology. Orang Inggris bisa saja mengatakan maaf lebih sering, tetapi tidak selalu berarti mereka merasa lebih bersalah.

Orang bisa saja menggunakannya untuk mengungkapkan rasa empati  jadi, saya mungkin saja mengatakan maaf hujan, kata Battistella. Mungkin memang orang Inggris dan Kanada yang menggunakan kata maaf semacam itu lebih sering, tetapi mereka tidak akan minta maaf begitu saja. Para peneliti lain sudah juga bebicara mengenai penggunaan kata sorry untuk berkomunikasi dengan kelas sosial lain, di mana orang semacam meminta maaf karena privilese yang mereka miliki.

Masyarakat Inggris menghargai para anggota masyarakat yang menunjukkan rasa hormat tanpa mengganggu ruang pribadi seseorang, serta tanpa menarik perhatian kepada diri sendiri: atau sifat-sifat yang disebut para ahli linguistik sebagai kesopanan negatif. Amerika, di sisi lain, merupakan masyarakat kesopanan positif, yang dicirikan dengan keramahan serta keinginan untuk menjadi bagian dari kelompok.

Sebagai akibatnya, orang Inggris kadang-kadang menggunakan kata maaf dengan cara yang tampak tidak tepat bagi orang luar, termasuk orang Amerika. Orang Inggris akan meminta maaf kepada orang yang mereka tidak kenal karena mereka ingin menanyakan sebuah informasi, atau karena ingin duduk di sebelah mereka. Semuanya karena jika tidak mengatakan maaf maka akan merupakan invasi bagi privasi orang yang tidak mereka kenal itu.

Penggunaan kata ini secara berlebihan, sangat sering tidak tepat dan terkadang menyesatkan yaitu menurunkan nilai kata itu, serta membuat hal-hal menjadi lebih membingungkan dan menyulitkan orang asing untuk menjadi terbiasa dengan cara-cara orang Inggris,"" kata Fox. Namun, katanya menambahkan, Saya pikir meminta maaf setiap saat bukanlah hal yang buruk. Hal ini juga masuk akal dalam konteks budaya kesopanan negatif ... Dari semua kata yang bisa dipilih suatu bangsa untuk digunakan sembarang begitu sering, tentunya sorry bukanlah yang terburuk.

Image copyright iStock Image caption Apakah penggunaan kata 'sorry' secara berlebihan dan sering tidak tepat, mengurangi nilainya?

Mungkin juga ada manfaat lain dari mengatakan 'sorry', seperti misalnya membina rasa percaya. Yang menarik, memang begitu kenyataannya sekalipun ketika orang meminta maaf untuk kesalahan yang tidak mereka buat, tetapi karena situasi kondisi yang ada di luar kendali mereka.

Dalam satu penelitian, Alison Wood Brooks dari Harvard Business School beserta rekan-rekan kerjanya merekrut seorang aktor pria untuk mendekati 65 orang asing di sebuah stasiun kereta api di Amerika Serikat pada suatu hari yang berhujan dan meminta meminjam telepon mereka. Dalam sebagian percobaan, orang asing ini memulai permintaannya dengan mengatakan, ""Maaf ya hujan. Ketika ia mengatakan hal ini, 47% orang asing meminjami telepon genggam mereka dibandingkan hanya 9% ketika dia langsung saja mengatakan ingin meminjam telepon mereka. Eksperimen lebih lanjut ternyata mengonfirmasikan bahwa permintaan maaf mengenai cuaca itu yang penting, bukan kesopanan dalam menuturkan kata-kata.

Dengan mengatakan maaf ya hujan, si peminta maaf yang berlebihan mengakui keadaan yang tidak menyenangkan, ikut mengambil sudut pandang sang korban dan mengungkapkan rasa empati bagi keadaan negatif  meskipun itu di luar kendalinya, kata Wood Brooks.

Tentu saja, orang Inggris bukan satu-satunya kelompok yang dikenal sering meminta maaf. Kaum perempuan sering kali diasumsikan demikian juga.

Untuk menguji apakah stereotip ini bisa bertahan ketika diperiksa, Schumann merekrut sekelompok mahasiswa untuk mencatat dalam 12 hari. Mereka mencatatkan semua situasi yang mereka temui ketika permintaan maaf memang pantas mereka dapatkan dan apakah memang mendapatkannya atau tidak. Schumann menemukan bahwa perempuan melontarkan kata sorry lebih sering daripada lelaki, tetapi mereka juga melaporkan perempuan melihat lebih banyak pelanggaran ketika mereka berpikir perlu meminta maaf  baik ketika mereka menjadi korban maupun ketika mereka yang melakukan kesalahan. Ketika hal ini dipertimbangkan, lelaki dan perempuan terbukti sama-sama siap meminta maaf atas pelanggaran yang mereka lakukan. Bukan karena lelaki tidak mau meminta maaf, tetapi karena mereka melihat adanya lebih sedikit pelanggaran yang memerlukan permintaan maaf, kata Schumann.

Jadi bagaimana halnya dengan keadaan ketika kita sadar bahwa kita memang benar-benar harus meminta maaf? Apakah lebih baik menekan rasa gengsi dan meminta maaf, atau  seperti kata aktor legendaris Amerika John Wayne  meminta maaf merupakan tanda kelemahan?

Orang khawatir bahwa meminta maaf akan dianggap juga sebagai pengakuan bertanggung jawab, bukan sekadar upaya untuk bersimpati dengan pihak yang dirugikan, kata Wood Brooks. Tetapi ia menambahkan permintaan maaf yang efektif langsung mengena pada perasaan si penerima. Permintaan maaf yang baik tidak mungkin jadi bumerang, dan lebih mungkin meningkatkan rasa percaya daripada tidak minta maaf sama sekali.

Image copyright iStock Image caption Permintaan maaf yang efektif langsung mengena pada perasaan si penerima  lebih mungkin meningkatkan rasa percaya daripada tidak minta maaf sama sekali.

Sedangkan mengenai bagaimana cara melakukannya, Battistella memberikan nasihat berikut, Cara yang tepat untuk meminta maaf adalah cara yang diajarkan ibu kita. Katakanlah, Anda melempar batu ke adik Anda. Ibu Anda akan membuat Anda pergi mendatangi adik Anda dan melihat matanya dan mengatakan, Maaf saya melemparkan batu kepadamu dan saya tidak akan melakukannya lagi. Penting untuk menyebutkan hal salah apa yang Anda lakukan, untuk menunjukkan bahwa Anda merasa bersalah dan untuk mengindikasikan bahwa hal ini tidak akan terjadi lagi di masa depan, kata Battistella.

Seberapa banyak Anda perlu mengucapkan permintaan maaf mungkin bervariasi tergantung pada di mana Anda hidup. Wood Brooks dan seorang mahasiswa PhD Harvard, Grant Donnelly, sudah mengumpulkan data awal yang menyebutkan bahwa untuk pelanggaran kecil, yang paling banyak adalah kata sederhana saya minta maaf.

Jika pelanggarannya besar, maka minta maaf dua kali kelihatannya jadi angka yang tepat untuk menyampaikan rasa empati, perasaan bersalah serta memulihkan rasa percaya dan rasa suka, kata Wood Brooks.

Tentunya, jika Anda orang Inggris, Anda perlu melakukannya berlipat ganda. Kata sorry sekali saja tidak dianggap sebagai permintaan maaf: kami harus mengulang-ulangnya dan membungkusnya dengan banyak kata sifat, kata Fox.

Mohon maaf untuk hujan ya.",[]

bbc.com,,Poland's Constitutional Court clashes with new government,[],"Image copyright AP Image caption The Constitutional Court's ruling came at the end of a two-day sitting

Many changes Poland's new conservative government has made to the functioning of the top legislative court are unconstitutional, judges have ruled.

However the government has indicated it will not recognise the Constitutional Court's judgment.

The new rules increase the number of judges needed for a ruling and change the order in which cases are heard.

The court's verdict means the country is heading towards a constitutional crisis, observers say.

The government is already coming under scrutiny from both Brussels and Washington for allegedly endangering democratic checks and balances, says the BBC's Adam Easton in Warsaw.

Since coming to power in October, the Law and Justice party (PiS) has regularly come to blows with the media and the opposition.

'Dramatically limiting'

Late last year the government passed legal amendments changing the way the Constitutional Court operates.

They require a two-thirds majority of the 15 judges to support a ruling for it to be valid, and also stipulate a quorum of 13 judges for rulings to be valid.

Image copyright AP Image caption Critics says the changes have paralysed the court

The PiS says the changes are needed to reflect the new balance of power after its landslide election win last year, Reuters news agency reported.

Prime Minister Beata Szydlo said the Constitutional Court's judgment would not be legally valid because the court had failed to adhere to the rule changes introduced by her party.

But critics say the changes mean the court is now unable to examine government legislation.

""Dramatically limiting the court's ability to function independently and thoroughly contravenes Poland's (political) system and cannot be tolerated,"" said Judge Stanislaw Biernat, announcing the ruling after a two-day session.

This issue has sparked protests against and in support of the government's stand.

The amendments to the law governing the court are being investigated by the European Commission for a possible breach of the rule of law.

Last month, a draft report by the Council of Europe - a human rights watchdog - said the changes make it extremely difficult for the court to take decisions, thereby endangering the rule of law.",[]

Researchers say they have discovered a new frog species with distinctive yellow eyebrows in Colombia.

The frog has a dark camouflage pattern which allows it to blend in with the rocky soil on which it dwells.

Researchers with the Humboldt Institute found the frog, which they named Pristimantis macrummendozai, in the Iguaquen Merchan moorlands, in central Boyaca province.

Colombia is one of the world's most biologically diverse countries.

Researchers said that the species was well adapted to its moorland surroundings.

They said that female Pristimantis took advantage of the moist soil to lay their eggs in the ground.

According to their studies, the Pristimanti's preferred breeding environment was at high altitude, above 3,500m (11,500ft).

Environmentalists in Colombia have been fighting for the country's moorlands to be protected.

Last month, they celebrated when Colombia's constitutional court banned mining in the moorlands, arguing that it could cause irreversible damage to their fragile ecosystem.",[]

bbc.com,,US election 2016: Has Donald Trump killed off Marco Rubio?,"['Anthony Zurcher', 'North America Reporter']","Donald Trump won two more states on his march toward the Republican nomination - did he kill off Marco Rubio's presidential dream in the process?

Call it ""lesser Tuesday"" - the respite between the blockbuster Southern primaries on 1 March and the key winner-take-all votes in Ohio and Florida on 15 March.

While the voting in Mississippi, Michigan, Idaho and Hawaii doesn't have the same kind of glamour or import as the other key electoral dates in March, that doesn't mean there aren't lessons to learn from the day's results.

The Marco Rubio death watch

Fourth place stings. If Marco Rubio were an Olympian, he'd be clapping politely and picking a nice spot to watch the medal ceremony. If it were a horse race, Rubio backers would be tearing up their betting slips.

Once again the Florida senator took a drubbing across the board, with single-digit finishes in both Michigan and Mississippi netting him zero convention delegates.

He may only place a few percentage points ahead of Ben Carson in Mississippi, who dropped out of the race last week and hasn't had a political pulse in weeks. It's got so bad Donald Trump didn't even feel compelled to belittle the candidate in his victory speech.

Full results - how the states were won

In hindsight his decision to wage total war against Mr Trump, flinging mud with both fists, was a disastrous mistake. And if his attacks were supposed to be a selfless kamikaze mission against the front-runner, well, the USS Trump is still steaming ahead.

Mr Rubio now has exactly one week to pull off a minor miracle and defeat Mr Trump in his home state of Florida. A win there likely won't improve his presidential prospects, which are basically zero, but it could salvage his pride. It would also do a great service for the anti-Trump forces, who are now largely left hoping for a primary season that ends in a draw and a brokered convention.

Top Trump

Reports of Donald Trump's demise are ... well, you know the drill by now.

After taking a beating from Mr Rubio and Ted Cruz at the Republican debate last week and being denounced by 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney on Saturday, the media were rife with reports that the front-runner's formidable armour might be cracking. He underperformed in voting on Saturday, posting losses in Kansas and Maine and only narrow wins in Kentucky and Louisiana. Perhaps the relentless attacks were finally taking a toll?

Er, no.

Mr Trump once again showed he has nationwide appeal. He dominated the vote in a Southern state not bordering Mr Cruz's Texas home, and rolled to victory in Michigan. That second win is particularly key, since the South is largely done voting but the Mid-West - with its blue-collar voters hit hard by the decline in US manufacturing - is just starting to weigh in.

Who is voting for Donald Trump?

In search of Trump's Scottish roots

Trump detractors may take some solace in the fact that both Michigan and Mississippi held primaries that were open to non-Republicans - a setup that has favoured the New Yorker in the past. Most of the remaining states only allow participation by registered Republicans.

They shouldn't get their hopes up too high, however. According to exit polls in both Michigan and Mississippi, Mr Trump performed equally well among Republicans and the unaffiliated.

Mr Trump is now in a position to deliver a mortal blow to his opponents next week and send the Republican establishment into full-on paroxysms of despair.

Cruz and Kasich survive

Going into Tuesday's voting, some thought that Mr Cruz could build on his weekend momentum and post a surprise win in Mississippi. Others speculated that Ohio Governor John Kasich could demonstrate his Mid-Western appeal and pull out a Michigan victory, as he invested considerable time and money there.

In the end Mr Trump won by comfortable margins in each state - which is hardly good news for either challenger.

Is Cruz the most radical Republican?

Mr Kasich can find a bit of a silver lining in Mr Rubio's abysmal performance, however. Without the Florida senator in the picture, he looks likely to pick up the mantle of the mainstream, moderate candidate. Of course this primary landscape is now littered with the bodies of establishment politicians, so he may not want to get too comfortable.

As for Mr Cruz, he pushed Mr Kasich for second place in Michigan, which has to be encouraging. If he's going to battle Mr Trump all the way to the Republican convention, the Texas senator will have to continue to show support outside his native South. He did beat Mr Trump in sparsely populated Idaho but the delegate prize was tiny.

Good news, bad news for Clinton

Once again Hillary Clinton posted a dominating win in a Southern state, taking Mississippi by nearly 70% and netting a lion's share of its 36 delegates.

Michigan was another story, however. Although polls showed her with a comfortable lead, Democratic voters had other ideas - and Bernie Sanders delivered a surprise defeat to the front-runner.

The good news for the former secretary of state is that big wins coupled with narrow losses will only continue her climb ahead of the Vermont senator in the all-important delegate count for the Democratic convention. Thanks to her dominating performance across the South, she's already built up a sizable lead, and Tuesday's balloting will add to it.

The most progressive president ever?

The bad news is that the South is nearly done voting, and the Michigan results could indicate that she will be in a dogfight with Mr Sanders in the Mid-West. While she still is the odds-on favourite to win the nomination, a series of narrow victories - or losses - from here on out will do little to encourage Mr Sanders to quit the race.

Instead, she seems destined to grind out a long, hard primary campaign against a stubborn opponent.

bbc.com,,Sex in Strange Places,[],"Stacey begins her journey in troubled Turkey. As the European gateway to the Middle East, it is a secular nation laced with conservative and religious attitudes to sex.

Though the subject of sex is largely taboo here, surprisingly, on paper Turkey is the most liberal of the countries Stacey visits in this three part investigative series. Prostitution is legal and there are even state-run brothels. Stacey meets sex workers who regard themselves as tutors to the uninitiated men of a sexually repressed society, preparing them for marriage. But even here Stacey discovers an overwhelming sense of terror pervades as she meets women who fear for their lives just for being seen talking to her.

In a world where state registered prostitutes have sex worker marked on their ID cards and will never be allowed to join the army, police or civil service, Stacey meets a brothel Madame and discovers that for many girls theres no way out.

While Turkey is home to the biggest gay pride march in the Muslim world, according to the campaign group Transgender Europe, there are six transgender people killed in Turkey every year. Rejected by their families and with employers refusing to hire them, many are forced to live in an underworld of illegal brothels where armed gangs and corrupt police officers exploit each and every one.

The war raging in neighbouring Syria has added an even darker, highly exploitative layer to this already stigma-rich business. Istanbul now has more Syrian refugees than the EU. War and sex-slavery go hand in hand, with many young Syrian girls and mothers forced to sell their bodies to make ends meet. Stacey braves the journey from Istanbul to Gaziantep close to the Syrian border where several hundred ISIS fighters are believed to live in hiding. Here she meets a young woman who was sold into sex slavery by ISIS fighters. Covered from head to toe in black, she desperately wants to share her story but is so traumatised that she cannot stop crying.

bbc.com,,ECB expected to launch new economic stimulus,[],"Image copyright Getty Images

The European Central Bank is expected to announce further measures to stimulate the eurozone economy when its governing council meets on Thursday.

Inflation has continued to fall, putting more pressure on ECB president Mario Draghi to take action.

The annual rate of inflation now stands at minus 0.2% - even further below the bank's target of just under 2%.

A figure that low underlines the weakness in the economies of the 19 countries that use the euro.

The ECB is widely expected to cut the deposit rate for funds from commercial banks even further into negative territory. Such a move is intended to encourage banks to lend more money and boost economic activity in theory.

The deposit rate for funds from commercial banks stands at minus 0.3%, which means they must pay to park money with the ECB, but may be cut to minus 0.4% or even minus 0.5%.

The negative rate is regarded as a drastic and experimental move that reveals just how far the ECB is from meeting its inflation target.

The ECB could also expand its bond-buying programme, also known as quantitative easing, which pumps newly printed money into the economy.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption ECB president Mario Draghi

It may decide to buy more than the current 60bn of bonds a month. The bank uses new cash to buy government and some private-sector bonds from banks. That pushes more euros into the banking system in the hope they will be loaned to businesses and consumers. In theory, that should eventually raise inflation and economic activity.

The programme could also be extended past its existing March 2017 end date.

Ben May, an analyst at Oxford Economics, said the ECB could raise the purchases to as much as 80bn a month.

Mr Draghi may also say that the ECB will not make banks hold more cash as reserves against possible losses, easing financial pressure on them.

His comments will be scrutinised for signs of dissent on the 25-member council.

Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany's central bank and a governing council member, has repeatedly warned against more ECB stimulus.

More broadly, the Bank for International Settlements - an international organisation of central banks - said in a report on Sunday that central bank measures could be ""approaching their limits"".

'Negative rate battle'

Traders will also monitor the effect of Mr Draghi's comments on the euro. Exports benefit if the euro falls against other currencies.

Marco Valli, chief eurozone economist at UniCredit Research, fears that the ECB may become ""trapped in a negative rate battle"" with other central banks such as those in Japan, Sweden and Switzerland that have also cut their rates below zero and encouraged their currencies to weaken.

If one currency falls, another must rise, cancelling out the effect of any stimulus measures.

However, Spreadex financial analyst Connor Campbell warned that no matter what Draighi revealed investors may well be disappointed: ""Given the arguable lack of effect the past and present programmes have had, it is difficult to tell what the markets would treat as a satisfactory announcement from the central bank.""

Analysis: Kamal Ahmed, economics editor

Negative interest rates sound like they come, fully formed, from the Through the Looking Glass world of economics.

Central banks in countries or geographies with a growth problem - Japan and the eurozone, for example - have used them to try and encourage lending and boost inflation.

Surely it is better for banks to put funds to work in the real world than deposit them at a central bank - and pay them for the privilege.

Sadly, that does not appear to be the case.

Highly regulated banks deposit excess funds with central banks because it is secure.

Lending to a wider range of businesses or buying into different asset classes is riskier and could have an expensive impact on the amount of capital the bank has to hold.

Negative interest rates have also tended to undermine banks' ability to make profits.

In a hyper-low interest rate world, banks feel unable to pass on the increased costs of negative interest rates to customers and are taking the hit themselves.

Bank share prices have fallen markedly in the last year as negative interest rates add to the financial services gloom.

And, if central banks are resorting to such unorthodox monetary policies, doesn't it just show that the global economy is in much more of a mess than anyone is admitting?",[]

La cifra es tres veces mayor al malware reportados por la empresa en 2014: 295.539.

Y entre las nuevas amenazas, le compania reporto un troyano llamado Triada, cuyo objetivo son los dispositivos que utilizan el sistema operativo Android.

Dada su complejidad, los expertos lo comparan con malware disenado para atacar Windows.

""Es sigiloso, modular, persistente y fue creado por ciberdelincuentes muy profesionales"", senalo Kaspersky Lab en su pagina web.

""Los dispositivos que usan las versiones 4.4.4 y anteriores del Android OS estan en gran riesgo"", indico.

Que hacer?

BBC Mundo consulto a varios expertos sobre que podemos hacer para proteger nuestros telefonos de ataques ciberneticos y les presentamos seis recomendaciones.

1. No trates de ser el superhacker

El experto en seguridad informatica Luis Enrique Corredera recomienda no ""rootear"" los celulares. Se trata de un termino conocido por los usuarios de Android y consiste en lograr acceder al sistema del telefono para hacer cambios profundos.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Manten la integridad del telefono y no desactives la opcion que detecta aplicaciones potencialmente daninas.

La palabra hace alusion a ""root"", que en ingles significa raiz.

Para los usuarios de iOS el termino de esta actividad se conoce como jailbreaking, que en ingles significa fuga.

Y es precisamente ese el primer consejo que Kaspersky Lab le ofrecio a BBC Mundo cuando le preguntamos por maneras de cuidar los dispositivos moviles.

""Evite el 'jailbreaking' del telefono"", indico Fabio Assolini, analista de seguridad de esa compania.

""Su telefono inteligente pasa a ser un objetivo mas grande para los agentes maliciosos cuando usted lo 'hackea' para descargar aplicaciones de otros sistemas operativos o cambiar de companias de telefonia movil"", anadio.

2. Piensa mal y acertaras

La medida en la que los expertos coinciden puede sonar un poco basica pero bien vale recordarla: sentido comun. Aunque se podria ir un poco mas alla: piensa mal.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Mantente siempre cuestionando el origen de las ventanas que te piden permiso para acceder a la configuracion de tu celular.

Frena tu dedo antes de hacer clic en una ventana que, por ejemplo, pide acceso a la configuracion de su celular o invita a instalar un programa.

Para Corredera, es clave que ""cuando naveguemos no descarguemos aplicaciones que conseguimos fuera de las tiendas oficiales o la fuentes confiables ni reaccionemos apresuradamente a mensajes que simulan ser el anuncio de un antivirus que supuestamente ha detectado un problema y nos pide hacer un analisis"".

El fundador de la compania de seguridad digital Flag Solutions aconseja que los usuarios no desactiven una opcion que en Android se conoce como ""Verificar aplicaciones"", esa funcion analiza todas las aplicaciones antes y despues de instalarlas para evitar que se instale un software malicioso.

""Se supone que las aplicaciones pasan por controles de seguridad estrictos. Si la aplicacion es sospechosa, esa funcion lo detectara"", indico Corredera en conversacion con BBC Mundo.

Kaspersky Lab tambien recomienda no abrir archivos adjuntos de correos electronicos en su telefono.

""Tal como el malware para computadoras, archivos adjuntos en moviles pueden contener programas maliciosos"", senala la empresa.

Tampoco aconsejan hacer clic en enlaces de mensajes de texto que puedan ser spam, pues pueden conducirlos a sitios web maliciosos.

3. Instala un ""doberman""

Asi como a muchos de nosotros nos gustaria instalar tres cerraduras, dos rejas, alambre con puas y un perro doberman bien entrenado en la puerta de nuestras casas, haz lo mismo con tu celular.

""Bloquee el acceso a su dispositivo movil con una contrasena fuerte para evitar que personas no autorizadas tengan acceso a su lista de contactos, fotos personales, aplicaciones y correos electronicos"", indica Kaspersky Lab.

Instalar un programa antimalware tambien es importante.

4. Recuerda el refran: ""Quien no oye consejo no llega a viejo""

No se trata de que prestes atencion a lo que dice todo el mundo o que hagas lo que la mayoria, pero no esta de mas leer opiniones de otros cibernautas.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Monitorear la experiencia de otras personas con una aplicacion que desconoces y de la cual no estas seguro es una recomendacion de los expertos.

El ingeniero en Sistemas Antonio Navas, quien tiene amplia experiencia en desarrollo de aplicaciones moviles, cree que a la hora de descargar hay que cerciorarse de que sean apps conocidas.

""Que sean aplicaciones que tengan muchas reviews y que las usen muchisimos usuarios. Hay que tener cuidado especialmente con juegos o aplicaciones que prometen bloquear, por ejemplo, anuncios publicitarios"", le indico a BBC Mundo.

""Si realmente quieren instalar aplicaciones que no son muy conocidas, es imprescindible revisar los permisos que la app necesita y si alguno le suena raro, es mejor no instalarla"", senalo el director de ingenieria de Duolingo.

5. Imagina que estas frente a tu computadora

Muchas son las medidas de seguridad que implementamos para proteger nuestras computadoras personales.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Las mismas precauciones que implementas para cuidar tu computadora las puedes usar para tu celular.

De hecho, varias de ellas las podemos usar para cuidar nuestros celulares.

""Tenga mucho cuidado con posibles sitios de phishing durante el uso de su navegador movil"", senala Assolini a BBC Mundo.

Si puede, teclee directamente la direccion del sitio en internet que quiere visitar.

""Si hace clic en un enlace hacia una nueva pagina, compruebe el URL para asegurarse de que no ha sido redirigido a un sitio desconocido"".

Otro consejo es guardar tantas copias como quiera de lo que tiene en su celular. Por ejemplo, guarde con regularidad sus fotos, videos y otros contenidos que son muy importantes para usted en discos externos o memorias externas.

Kaspersky Lab tambien sugiere activar la opcion de borrado remoto.

""El problema mas comun que afecta a los usuarios de moviles es la perdida fisica de su telefono... desde olvidarlo en la parte posterior de un taxi hasta el robo de este"", dice Assolini. ""Limpiando la memoria prevendra que ladrones accedan a la informacion personal en el telefono"".

6. Y como haces en la calle, voltea a ver quien te sigue

Aunque fisicamente nadie esta detras de usted, en la jungla de internet muchas personas pueden ver lo que usted hace con su celular.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Mientras navegamos en la web podamos dejar pistas sin quererlo y los ciberdelincuentes las siguen.

Por eso, la empresa recomienda apagar la funcion de bluetooth cuando no la este utilizando.

""Cualquier persona con un telefono con bluetooth puede espiar facilmente su actividad en el telefono, las llamadas que realice, y los mensajes de texto que envie. Ademas, no acepte mensajes enviados via Bluetooth de numeros de telefonos extranos.

Y evitar las redes Wi-Fi publicas, pues ""la informacion que se transmite a traves de estas redes no seguras puede ser interceptada por los cibercriminales. Esto puede incluir su numero de cuenta bancaria o tarjeta de credito"", indico la compania dedicada a la seguridad informatica.",[]

bbc.com,,How impulse shopping led to a multi-million-pound business,"['Business Reporter', 'Bbc News', 'Katie Hope']","Media caption Sebastien Fabre says his wife's impulse shopping provided the inspiration for Vestiaire Collective

Inspiration for an entrepreneur often comes when they look for something - a service or a product they need - only to find it doesn't yet exist.

In Sebastien Fabre's case it was his wife's impulse shopping that provided the inspiration that led to the creation of Vestiaire Collective - an online marketplace for second-hand goods.

Mr Fabre, then a Microsoft executive, freely admits he knew nothing about fashion when he got married. But he did know that his wife, who enjoyed shopping, had a lot of bags.

And because she worked in the fashion industry, these impulse purchases weren't just any old bags, but high-end designer ones from the likes of Chanel and Hermes. Yet, despite having so many of them, 13 to be exact, she used just one. The rest languished, unused, in the wardrobe.

Image caption ""There's a lot of treasure sleeping in the wardrobe of people,"" says Vestiaire Collective founder Sebastien Fabre

Together they decided to sell them, but despite the plethora of second-hand marketplaces already in existence, such as eBay and Amazon, they couldn't find anywhere where they felt their credentials as a seller would be trusted and where the bags' value would be recognised.

It sparked an idea. Rather than accept the status quo, and suspecting it wasn't just his wife who had unused designer items, Mr Fabre decided to do something about it.

Six months later, having roped in five other people, he established Vestiaire Collective - an online marketplace for second-hand designer bags, shoes, accessories and clothing. The first thing they listed for sale? His wife's handbags.

Image copyright Birkin bags Image caption Web developers don't typically know the name of a Birkin bag - the handbag named after actress and singer Jane Birkin - says Vestiaire Collective founder Sebastien Fabre

Eight years after its 2009 foundation - at the height of the financial crisis - sales are growing 85% year-on-year. ""There's a lot of treasure sleeping in the wardrobe of people,"" Mr Fabre says.

It has four million members in over 40 countries and last year its sales totalled some 77m (59m). It makes money from the commission it charges customers on sales. Typically this is 25%, or for those who use its concierge service, which photographs and lists products on customers' behalf, it takes 35%.

The rapid growth is not bad for someone who until he set up the business had been working in tech and knew absolutely nothing about fashion.

But Mr Fabre says he was aware of this weakness all along - and deliberately ensured that three of the five co-founders he bought on board had fashion backgrounds.

And while he admits it's ""pretty tricky"" for a website developer to know what, for example, a Birkin bag is, he believes it's important for the whole team - whether on the fashion side or on the development side - to understand the type of products they are selling.

Image caption Vestiaire Collective checks all items sold are authentic before sending them to customers

Image caption Around a third of products offered for sale are rejected by the firm

The online revolution has driven the development of many similar websites.

Rivals to Vestiaire Collective include Edit Second Hand, Hardly Ever Worn It, and High Society. Yet the size of the growing market for upper premium brands still makes it attractive, with the sector valued at 16bn, according to management consultancy Bain & Co.

Mr Fabre believes the firm's focus on authenticating the products and ensuring they are in good condition is helping it to stand out.

Unlike broader online auction sites, anyone who wants to sell an item via their website first needs the company's approval.

A potential seller will email in photos of their product alongside a description and the price they want.

This will then be checked by an in-house team to see if it's suitable, considering factors such as whether it's an appropriate brand, on trend and of sufficient quality. Around a third of potential items are rejected. Vestiaire Collective will then crop the photos before posting them on its site.

'We control everything'

When an item is bought, the seller sends it not to the customer but to the firm which will check it's the real deal and in a good condition before sending it to the buyer. The entire process takes around seven days.

But it's this service which Mr Fabre believes makes its offering more unusual.

""We control everything, so 100% of the product goes through our hands before going to the final buyer,"" he says.

Image caption Vestiaire Collective co-founder Fanny Moizant says they were inspired by luxury designer fashion website Net a Porter

The aim also - in this high end world - is to make all the items and the website itself look like a designer - rather than a used goods - website.

Fellow co-founder Fanny Moizant says its inspiration was luxury designer fashion website Net-a-Porter rather than the existing second-hand online shops.

""I even had some people saying 'oh my god I didn't even spot it was second hand', so people might think it's another online retailer selling new pieces. We tried as much as we can to combine those two,"" she says.

Image caption In exchange for a higher commission charge Vestiaire Collective collects, photographs and lists members' items for them

Despite this, both Mr Fabre and Ms Moizant argue that their offering complements rather than rivals that of the existing designers.

Mr Fabre says the firm provides an opportunity for someone to buy an item that is no longer available, provides money for people to reinvest in new designer items and offers accessible prices for those new to designer buying.

""We're building the value and respecting the value of the luxury market. It also keeps up the value of fashion items,"" he says.

Peter York, who has advised many large luxury companies, agrees, noting that one of the criteria used to define a luxury product is that the item holds its value.

But he warns the concept of second-hand luxury won't appeal in all markets across the world.

""I think they have a chance amongst more evolved kinds of consumers in the West. You know, if you come out of a tough world you don't want second-hand; second-hand implies poverty,"" he says.

Mr Fabre is undaunted, comparing the still relatively fledgling world of second-hand fashion with that of the more established car industry. He notes that people routinely trade in their old cars for newer models.

Is that his next move?

Mr Fabre laughs, aware of the dangers for a start-up of expanding too quickly. ""My investors like to remind me that I have to focus on my core business first,"" he says.

bbc.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,The worlds smallest kingdom,['Eliot Stein'],"Just south of Sardinia's world-famous Costa Smeralda, the lonely island of Tavolara rises wildly from the cerulean sea like a jagged mountain. There are no roads or hotels, and the only inhabitable stretch is a white-sand tongue thats best measured from end to end in steps.

This is where I found Antonio Bertoleoni as our ferry sputtered to a float. Better known as ""Tonino"", the 83-year-old former fisherman owns Tavolaras only restaurant and is the reigning ruler of the island, which happens to be the smallest inhabited kingdom in the world. For the past 22 years, Tonino has commanded this 5sqkm mini-monarchy in shorts and sandals.

Im probably the worlds most ordinary king.

Im probably the worlds most ordinary king, Tonino said, burying his feet in the sand and looking toward his restaurant. The only privilege I enjoy is free meals.

The Kingdom of Tavolara is currently celebrating its 180th anniversary and actually predates Italy by 25 years. Forming your own island nation might sound like the kind of thing youd dream up when youre marooned in the Mediterranean, but the story began in 1807 when Toninos great-great-grandfather, Giuseppe Bertoleoni, became the then uninhabited islands first settler. Described as a half shepherd, half pirate in the book Tavolara, Island of the Kings, the Genovese immigrant had recently married two sisters and was seeking a safe haven to escape his bigamy charge.

Giuseppe and his small harem soon realised that they were sharing their island paradise with a rare species of wild goats whose teeth were dyed a golden-yellow colour by the seaweed and lichen they ate. Word of the gilt-toothed goats eventually spread to Sardinias ruler, Carlo Alberto, who eagerly travelled to Tavolara to hunt the animals in 1836. Giuseppes 24-year-old son, Paolo, guided the hunting excursions.

When he landed, Carlo Alberto introduced himself by saying, Im Carlo Alberto, the King of Sardinia, Tonino said. And so my great-grandfather replied, Well, Im Paolo, the King of Tavolara.

After killing several goats and feasting for three days at Paolos home, Carlo Alberto was so delighted that he said, Paolo, you really are the King of Tavolara! before sailing off, according to Tonino. Joking or not, Carlo Alberto later confirmed that the far-flung island had never officially been part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, and he sent Paolo a scroll from Carlo Albertos royal family, the House of Savoy, that certified the monarchys status.

Paolo promptly created the Bertoleoni coat of arms and painted it on the wall of his home. He also drew a royal family tree and built a cemetery on the island for himself and his descendants. When he died, he insisted on being buried with a crown cemented atop his tombstone  something he never wore while alive.

In the years that followed, news of the islands sovereignty spread beyond the Mediterranean, and tiny Tavolara even formed a handful of political allies.Giuseppe Garibaldi, one of Italys founding fathers, soon became a trusted advisor of the Bertoleoni family; and the King of Sardinia at the time, Vittorio Emanuele II, went so far as to sign a peace treaty with the stamp-sized islands 33 residents in 1903.

While collecting photographs of world leaders, Queen Victoria commissioned a British naval vessel to stop by the island so that officers could photograph Tavolaras royal family. For years, the gold-framed photo was displayed in Buckingham Palace with the caption Worlds Smallest Kingdom. Today, a giant copy of it hangs in Toninos restaurant, which is appropriately called The King of Tavolara and adorned with the royal crest that King Paolo I first designed.

After 126 years, the installation of a NATO base in 1962 effectively ended the kingdoms independence, and made a quarter of the island off-limits to its handful of residents. Yet, like San Marino, Tavolara has never been formally annexed into modern Italy, making Tonino the fifth king in a kingdom that the world no longer recognises.

These days, when hes not fishing for squid or gardening outside his squat bungalow, his majesty lords over Tavolara's 11 part-time residents, 100 nimble mountain goats and a few species of endangered falcons that live atop the islands 565m limestone peak. For the past 40 years, Tonino has been personally escorting visitors to his familys island palace  first by rowboat, and now via a 25-minute ferry that he operates from Porto San Paolo.

My family may have had a beautiful past, Tonino said in a soft voice, but we work hard and live simply, just like everybody else.

In fact, running the kingdom is very much a family business. While the king and his nephew, Nicola, captain the summer ferry, the prince and princess in waiting, Giuseppe and Loredana, now run the beachside restaurant. Giuseppes nephew, Antonio, wakes up early to go fishing every morning and supplies most of the clams, lobster and fish that fly out of the kitchen each afternoon and evening.

Thanks to a wave of tourism to the island, the kingdoms GDP has been strong recently. Ironically, Tavolara is now the crown jewel in a protected Italian national marine reserve that has one of the highest levels of biomass in the Mediterranean. As a result, the island has quickly become one of the top diving destinations in Italy, with visitors flocking to swim with tortoises, sperm whales and basking sharks before coming up for air at the al fresco restaurant.

For me, its a privilege just to live here. Who needs a crown when you have a palace.

While Tonino still likes to greet guests as they come from the dock, his favourite part of the day is before the swell of sun worshippers and scuba enthusiasts descend on his empire. Just after dawn, he likes to walk past Tavolaras handful of sunset-coloured homes and along a dusty path to visit the royal cemetery. Since King Paolo I passed in 1886, the plot has grown to hold every noble member of the kingdom  most recently Toninos wife, Queen Pompea, who passed away several years ago.

I like to bring her plastic flowers, Tonino said. If I brought her fresh ones, the goats would just eat them.

Like most of the Bertoleonis who came before him and the prince who will one day succeed him, Tonino is technically an Italian citizen. He once vowed to make an appeal to Vittorio Emanuele IV, the son of the last King of Italy and the self-proclaimed Duke of Savoy, for the royal family to once again recognise the Kingdom of Tavolara, but then had a change of heart.

For me, its a privilege just to live here, Tonino said, staring out past the dock at his emerald empire. Who needs a crown when you have a palace?

Abu Anis only realised something unusual was happening when he heard the sound of explosions coming from the old city on the western bank of the Tigris as it runs through Mosul.

""I phoned some friends over there, and they said armed groups had taken over, some of them foreign, some Iraqis,"" the computer technician said. ""The gunmen told them, 'We've come to get rid of the Iraqi army, and to help you.'""

The following day, the attackers crossed the river and took the other half of the city. The Iraqi army and police, who vastly outnumbered their assailants, broke and fled, officers first, many of the soldiers stripping off their uniforms as they joined a flood of panicked civilians.

It was 10 June 2014, and Iraq's second biggest city, with a population of around two million, had just fallen to the militants of the group then calling itself Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham/the Levant (Isis or Isil).

Four days earlier, black banners streaming, a few hundred of the Sunni militants had crossed the desert border in a cavalcade from their bases in eastern Syria and met little resistance as they moved towards their biggest prize.

Rich dividends were immediate. The Iraqi army, rebuilt, trained and equipped by the Americans since the US-led invasion of 2003, abandoned large quantities of armoured vehicles and advanced weaponry, eagerly seized by the militants. They also reportedly grabbed something like $500m from the Central Bank's Mosul branch.

How rich is IS?

Despite territorial losses, IS survives, thanks in no small part to its status as ""the best-funded terrorist organisation"" in history. While most people decry the validity inferred from the name of IS as a ""state"", the group's financing is certainly more reminiscent of a state than that of organisations such as al-Qaeda that relied heavily on donations to fund their operations.

Islamic State: The struggle to stay rich

""At the beginning, they behaved well,"" said Abu Anis. ""They took down all the barricades the army had put up between quarters. People liked that. On their checkpoints they were friendly and helpful - 'Anything you need, we're here for you.'""

The Mosul honeymoon was to last a few weeks. But just down the road, terrible things were already happening.

As the Iraqi army collapsed throughout the north, the militants moved swiftly down the Tigris river valley. Towns and villages fell like skittles. Within a day they had captured the town of Baiji and its huge oil refinery, and moved on swiftly to seize Saddam Hussein's old hometown, Tikrit, a Sunni hotbed.

Just outside Tikrit is a big military base, taken over by the Americans in 2003 and renamed Camp Speicher after the first US casualty in the 1991 ""Desert Storm"" Gulf war against Iraq, a pilot called Scott Speicher, shot down over al-Anbar province in the west.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bodies being exhumed at Camp Speicher, 2015

Camp Speicher, by now full of Iraqi military recruits, was surrounded by the Isis militants and surrendered. The thousands of captives were sorted, the Shia were weeded out, bound, and trucked away to be systematically shot dead in prepared trenches. Around 1,700 are believed to have been massacred in cold blood. The mass graves are still being exhumed.

Far from trying to cover up the atrocity, Isis revelled in it, posting on the internet videos and pictures showing the Shia prisoners being taken away and shot by the black-clad militants.

In terms of exultant cruelty and brutality, worse was not long in coming.

After a pause of just two months, Isis - now rebranded as ""Islamic State"" (IS) - erupted again, taking over large areas of northern Iraq controlled by the Kurds.

That included the town of Sinjar, mainly populated by the Yazidis, an ancient religious minority regarded by IS as heretics.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Yazidi women in Germany protest against IS attacks on their community in northern Iraq, 2014

Hundreds of Yazidi men who failed to escape were simply killed. Women and children were separated and taken away as war booty, to be sold and bartered as chattels, and used as sex slaves. Thousands are still missing, enduring that fate.

Deliberately shocking, bloodthirsty exhibitionism reached a climax towards the end of the same month, August 2014.

IS issued a video showing its notorious, London-accented and now late executioner Mohammed Emwazi (sardonically nicknamed ""Jihadi John"" by former captives) gruesomely beheading American journalist James Foley.

In the following weeks, more American and British journalists and aid workers - Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, and Peter Kassig (who had converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul Rahman) - appeared being slaughtered in similar, slickly produced videos, replete with propaganda statements and dire warnings.

Image caption Murdered Western hostages: (From top left clockwise) Steven Sotloff, David Haines, James Foley, Alan Henning, Abdul Rahman (Peter) Kassig

In the space of a few months, IS had blasted its way from obscurity on to the centre of the world stage. Almost overnight, it became a household word.

Seven-and-a-half thousand miles (12,000km) away, then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott summed up the breathtaking novelty of the horror. It was, he said ""medieval barbarism, perpetrated and spread with the most modern of technology"".

IS had arrived, and the world was taking notice. But the men in black did not appear out of the blue. They had been a long time coming.

The theology of murder

The ideological or religious roots of IS and like-minded groups go deep into history, almost to the beginning of Islam itself in the 7th Century AD.

Like Christianity six centuries before it, and Judaism some eight centuries before that, Islam was born into the harsh, tribal world of the Middle East.

""The original texts, the Old Testament and the Koran, reflected primitive tribal Jewish and Arab societies, and the codes they set forth were severe,"" writes the historian and author William Polk.

""They aimed, in the Old Testament, at preserving and enhancing tribal cohesion and power and, in the Koran, at destroying the vestiges of pagan belief and practice. Neither early Judaism nor Islam allowed deviation. Both were authoritarian theocracies.""

As history moved on, Islam spread over a vast region, encountering and adjusting to numerous other societies, faiths and cultures. Inevitably in practice it mutated in different ways, often becoming more pragmatic and indulgent, often given second place to the demands of power and politics and temporal rulers.

For hardline Muslim traditionalists this amounted to deviationism, and from early on, there was a clash of ideas in which those arguing for a strict return to the ""purity"" of the early days of Islam often paid a price.

The eminent scholar Ahmad ibn Hanbal (780-855), who founded one of the main schools of Sunni Islamic jurisprudence, was jailed and once flogged unconscious in a dispute with the Abbasid caliph in Baghdad. Nearly five centuries later, another supreme theologian of the same strict orthodox school, Ibn Taymiyya, died in prison in Damascus.

These two men are seen as the spiritual forefathers of later thinkers and movements which became known as ""salafist"", advocating a return to the ways of the first Muslim ancestors, the salaf al-salih (righteous ancestors).

They inspired a later figure whose thinking and writings were to have a huge and continuing impact on the region and on the salafist movement, one form of which, Wahhabism, took his name.

Media caption How so-called Islamic State started - In 3 minutes

Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab was born in 1703 in a small village in the Nejd region in the middle of the Arabian peninsula.

A devout Islamic scholar, he espoused and developed the most puritanical and strict version of what he saw as the original faith, and sought to spread it by entering pacts with the holders of political and military power.

In an early foray in that direction, his first action was to destroy the tomb of Zayd ibn al-Khattab, one of the Companions of the Prophet Muhammad, on the grounds that by the austere doctrine of salafist theology, the veneration of tombs constitutes shirk, the revering of something or someone other than Allah.

But it was in 1744 that Abd al-Wahhab made his crucial alliance with the local ruler, Muhammad ibn Saud. It was a pact whereby Wahhabism provided the spiritual or ideological dimension for Saudi political and military expansion, to the benefit of both.

Passing through several mutations, that dual alliance took over most of the peninsula and has endured to this day, with the House of Saud ruling in sometimes uneasy concert with an ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment.

The entrenchment of Wahhabi salafism in Saudi Arabia - and the billions of petrodollars to which it gained access - provided one of the wellsprings for jihadist militancy in the region in modern times. Jihad means struggle on the path of Allah, which can mean many kinds of personal struggle, but more often is taken to mean waging holy war.

But the man most widely credited, or blamed, for bringing salafism into the 20th Century was the Egyptian thinker Sayyid Qutb. He provided a direct bridge from the thought and heritage of Abd al-Wahhab and his predecessors to a new generation of jihadist militants, leading up to al-Qaeda and all that was to follow.

Image copyright Creative Commons Image caption Sayyid Qutb, ""the source of all jihadist thought""

Born in a small village in Upper Egypt in 1906, Sayyid Qutb found himself at odds with the way Islam was being taught and managed around him. Far from converting him to the ways of the West, a two-year study period in the US in the late 1940s left him disgusted at what he judged unbridled godless materialism and debauchery, and his fundamentalist Islamic outlook was honed harder.

Back in Egypt, he developed the view that the West was imposing its control directly or indirectly over the region in the wake of the Ottoman Empire's collapse after World War One, with the collaboration of local rulers who might claim to be Muslims, but who had in fact deviated so far from the right path that they should no longer be considered such.

For Qutb, offensive jihad against both the West and its local agents was the only way for the Muslim world to redeem itself. In essence, this was a kind of takfir - branding another Muslim an apostate or kafir (infidel), making it justified and even obligatory and meritorious to kill him.

Although he was a theorist and intellectual rather than an active jihadist, Qutb was judged dangerously subversive by the Egyptian authorities. He was hanged in 1966 on charges of involvement in a Muslim Brotherhood plot to assassinate the nationalist President, Gamal Abdel Nasser.

Qutb was before his time, but his ideas lived on in the 24 books he wrote, which have been read by tens of millions, and in the personal contact he had with the circles of people like Ayman al-Zawahiri, another Egyptian who is the current al-Qaeda leader.

Another intimate of the al-Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden said: ""Qutb was the one who most affected our generation."" He has also been described as ""the source of all jihadist thought"", and ""the philosopher of the Islamic revolution"".

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 9/11: The attackers were influenced by Qutb's writings

More than 35 years after he was hanged, the official commission of inquiry into al-Qaeda's 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in 2001 concluded: ""Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalise even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defence of an embattled faith.""

And his influence lingers on today. Summing up the roots of IS and its predecessors, the Iraqi expert on Islamist movements Hisham al-Hashemi said: ""They are founded on two things: a takfiri faith based on the writings of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and as methodology, the way of Sayyid Qutb.""

The theology of militant jihadism was in place. But to flourish, it needed two things - a battlefield, and strategists to shape the battle.

Afghanistan was to provide the opportunity for both.

Rise of al-Qaeda

The Soviet invasion in 1979, and the 10 years of occupation that followed, provided a magnet for would-be jihadists from around the Arab world. Some 35,000 of them flocked to Afghanistan during that period, to join the jihad and help the mainly Islamist Afghan mujahedeen guerrillas turn the country into Russia's Vietnam.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Soviet forces in Afghanistan, 1980

There is little evidence that the ""Afghan Arabs"", as they became known, played a pivotal combat role in driving the Soviets out. But they made a major contribution in setting up support networks in Pakistan, channelling funds from Saudi Arabia and other donors, and funding schools and militant training camps. It was a fantastic opportunity for networking and forging enduring relationships as well as tasting jihad first hand.

Ironically, they found themselves on the same team as the Americans. The CIA's Operation Cyclone channelled hundreds of millions of dollars through Pakistan to militant Afghan mujahedeen leaders such as Golbuddin Hekmatyar, who associated closely with the Arab jihadists.

It was in Afghanistan that virtually all the major figures in the new jihadist world cut their teeth. They helped shape events there in the aftermath of the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, a period that saw the emergence of al-Qaeda as a vehicle for a wider global jihad, and Afghanistan provided a base for it.

By the time the Taliban took over in 1996, they were virtually in partnership with Osama Bin Laden and his men, and it was from there that al-Qaeda launched its fateful 9/11 attack in 2001.

The formative Afghan experience provided both the combat-hardened salafist jihadist leaders and the strategists who were to play an instrumental role in the emergence of the IS of today.

Most significant was the Jordanian jihadist Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who more than anybody else ended up being the direct parent of IS in almost every way.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Abu Musab al-Zarqawi

A high-school dropout whose prison career began with a sentence for drug and sexual offences, Zarqawi found religion after being sent to classes at a mosque in the Jordanian capital, Amman. He arrived in Pakistan to join jihad in Afghanistan just in time to see the Soviets withdraw in 1989, but stayed on to work with jihadists.

After a stint back in Jordan where he received a 15-year jail sentence on terrorist charges but was later released in a general amnesty, Zarqawi finally met Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri in 1999. By all accounts the two al-Qaeda leaders did not take to him. They found him brash and headstrong, and they did not like the many tattoos from his previous life that he had not been able to erase.

But he was charismatic and dynamic, and although he did not join al-Qaeda, they eventually put him in charge of a training camp in Herat, western Afghanistan. It was here that he worked with an ideologue whose radical writings became the scriptures governing subsequent salafist blood-letting: Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir.

""The brutality of beheading is intended, even delightful to God and His Prophet,"" wrote Muhajir in his book The Theology of Jihad, more generally referred to as the Theology of Bloodshed. His writings provided religious cover for the most brutal excesses, and also for the killing of Shia as infidels, and their Sunni collaborators as apostates.

The other book that has been seen as the virtual manual - even the Mein Kampf - for IS and its forebears is The Management of Savagery, by Abu Bakr Naji, which appeared on the internet in 2004.

Image copyright Creative commons Image caption The Management of Savagery, a virtual manual for jihadists

""We need to massacre and to do just as has been done to Banu Qurayza, so we must adopt a ruthless policy in which hostages are brutally and graphically murdered unless our demands are met,"" Naji wrote. He was referring to a Jewish tribe in seventh-century Arabia which reportedly met the same fate at the hands of early Muslims as the Yazidis of Sinjar did nearly 14 centuries later: the men were slaughtered, the women and children enslaved.

Naji's sanctioning of exemplary brutality was part of a much wider strategy to prepare the way for an Islamic caliphate. Based partly on the lessons of Afghanistan, his book is a detailed blueprint for provoking the west into interventions which would further rally the Muslims to jihad, leading to the ultimate collapse of the enemy.

The scenario is not so fanciful if you consider that the Soviet Union went to pieces barely two years after its withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Naji is reported to have been killed in a US drone strike in Pakistan's Waziristan province in 2008.

Iraq fiasco

The fallout from the 9/11 attacks changed things radically for the jihadists in late 2001. The US and allies bombed and invaded Afghanistan, ousting the Taliban, and launching a wider ""War on Terror"" against al-Qaeda.

Bin Laden went underground, and Zarqawi and others fled. The dispersing militants, fired up, badly needed another battlefield on which to provoke and confront their Western enemies.

Luck was on their side. The Americans and their allies were not long in providing it.

Their invasion of Iraq in the spring of 2003 was, it turned out, entirely unjustified on its own chosen grounds - Saddam Hussein's alleged production of weapons of mass destruction, and his supposed support for international terrorists, neither of which was true.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bombardment of Baghdad before the US-led invasion in 2003

By breaking up every state and security structure and sending thousands of disgruntled Sunni soldiers and officials home, they created precisely the state of ""savagery"", or violent chaos, that Abu Bakr Naji envisaged for the jihadists to thrive in.

Iraq was on the way to becoming what US officials are now calling the ""parent tumour"" of the IS presence in the region.

Under Saddam's tightly-controlled Baath Party regime, the Sunnis enjoyed pride of place over the majority Shia, who have strong ties with their co-religionists across the border in Iran.

The US-led intervention disempowered the Sunnis, creating massive resentment and providing fertile ground for the outside salafist jihadists to take root in.

They were not long in spotting their constituency. Abu Musab Zarqawi moved in, and within a matter of months was organising deadly, brutal and provocative attacks aimed both at Western targets and at the majority Shia community.

Doctrinal differences between the two sects go back to disputes over the succession to the Prophet Muhammad in the early decades of Islam, but conflict between them is generally based on community, history and sectarian politics rather than religion as such.

Setting himself up with a new group called Tawhid wa al-Jihad (Tawhid means declaring the uniqueness of Allah), Zarqawi immediately forged a pragmatic operational alliance with underground cells of the remnants of Saddam's regime, providing the two main intertwined strands of the Sunni-based insurgency: militant Jihadism, and Iraqi Sunni nationalism.

His group claimed responsibility for several deadly attacks in August 2003 that set the pattern for much of what was to come: a suicide truck bomb explosion at the UN headquarters in Baghdad that killed the envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and 20 of his staff, and a suicide car bomb blast in Najaf which killed the influential Shia ayatollah Muhammad Baqir al-Hakim and 80 of his followers. The bombers were salafist jihadists, but logistics were reportedly provided by underground Baathists.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Zarqawi was behind the deadly 2003 bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad

The following year, Zarqawi himself was believed by the CIA to be the masked killer shown in a video beheading an American hostage, Nicholas Berg, in revenge for the Abu Ghraib prison abuses of Iraqi detainees by members of the US military.

As the battle with the Americans and the new Shia-dominated Iraqi government intensified, Zarqawi finally took the oath of loyalty to Bin Laden, and his group became the official al-Qaeda branch in Iraq.

But they were never really on the same page. Zarqawi's provocative attacks on Shia mosques and markets, triggering sectarian carnage, and his penchant for publicising graphic brutality, were all in line with the radical teachings he had imbibed. But they drew rebukes from the al-Qaeda leadership, concerned at the impact on Muslim opinion.

Zarqawi paid little heed. His strain of harsh radicalism passed to his successors after he was killed by a US air strike in June 2006 on his hideout north of Baghdad. He was easily identified by the tattoos he had never managed to get rid of.

The direct predecessor of IS emerged just a few months later, with the announcement of the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) as an umbrella bringing the al-Qaeda branch together with other insurgent factions.

But tough times lay ahead. In January 2007, the Americans began ""surging"" their own troops in Iraq from 132,000 to a peak of 168,000, adopting a much more hands-on approach in mentoring the rebuilt Iraqi army. At the same time, they enticed Sunni tribes in western al-Anbar province to stop supporting the jihadists and join the US-led Coalition-Iraqi government drive to quell the insurgency, which many did, on promises that they would be given jobs and control over their own security.

By the time both the new ISI and al-Qaeda leaders were killed in a US-Iraqi army raid on their hideout in April 2010, the insurgency was at its lowest ebb, pushed back into remote corners of Sunni Iraq.

They were both replaced by one man, about whom very little was publicly known at the time, and not much more since: Ibrahim Awad al-Badri, better known by his nom de guerre, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Six eventful years later, he would be proclaimed Caliph Ibrahim, Commander of the Faithful and leader of the newly declared ""Islamic State"".

Territorial takeover

Baghdadi's career is so shrouded in mist that there are very few elements of it that can be regarded as fact. By all accounts he was born near Samarra, north of Baghdad, so the epithet ""Baghdadi"" seems to have been adopted to give him a more national image, while ""Abu Bakr"" evokes the first successor to (and father-in-law of) Prophet Muhammad.

Like the original Abu Bakr, Baghdadi is also reputed to come from the Prophet's Quraysh clan. That, and his youth - born in 1971 - may have been factors in his selection as leader.

All accounts of his early life agree that he was a quiet, scholarly and devout student of Islam, taking a doctorate at the Islamic University of Baghdad. Some even say he was shy, and a bit of a loner, living for 10 years in a room beside a small Sunni mosque in western Baghdad.

The word ""charismatic"" has never been attached to him.

Who is the leader of IS?

Image caption 29 June 2014: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi makes a rare appearance in public

As a youth, Baghdadi had a passion for Koranic recitation and was meticulous in his observance of religious law. His family nicknamed him The Believer because he would chastise his relatives for failing to live up to his stringent standards.

Who is Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi?

But by the time of the US-led invasion in 2003, he appears to have become involved with a militant Sunni group, heading its sharia (Islamic law) committee. American troops detained him, and he was reportedly held in the detention centre at Camp Bucca in the south for most of 2004.

Camp Bucca (named after a fireman who died in the 9/11 attacks) housed up to 20,000 inmates and became a university from which many IS and other militant leaders graduated. It gave them an unrivalled opportunity to imbibe and spread radical ideologies and sabotage skills and develop important contacts and networks, all in complete safety, under the noses and protection of their enemies.

Baghdadi would also certainly have met in Camp Bucca many of the ex-Baathist military commanders with whom he was to form such a deadly partnership.

The low-profile, self-effacing Baghdadi rang no alarm bells with the Americans. They released him, having decided he was low-risk.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Camp Bucca, 2008: A ""university"" for future IS leaders

But he went on to work his way steadily up through the insurgent hierarchy, virtually unknown to the Iraqi public.

By the time Baghdadi took over in 2010, the curtains seemed to be coming down for the jihadists in the Iraqi field of ""savagery"".

But another one miraculously opened up for them across the border in neighbouring Syria at just the right moment. In the spring of 2011, the outbreak of civil war there offered a promising new arena of struggle and expansion. The majority Sunnis were in revolt against the oppressive regime of Bashar al-Assad, dominated by his Alawite minority, an offshoot of Shia Islam.

Baghdadi sent his men in. By December 2011, deadly car bombs were exploding in Damascus which turned out to be the work of the then shadowy al-Nusra Front. It announced itself as an al-Qaeda affiliate the following month. It was headed by a Syrian jihadist, Abu Mohammed al-Julani. He had been sent by Baghdadi, but had his own ideas.

Jostling with a huge array of competing rebel groups in Syria, al-Nusra won considerable support on the ground because of its fearless and effective fighting skills, and the flow of funds and foreign fighters that support from al-Qaeda stimulated. It was relatively moderate in its salafist approach, and cultivated local relationships.

Al-Nusra was slipping out of Baghdadi's control, and he didn't like it. In April 2013, he tried to rein it back, announcing that al-Nusra was under his command in a new Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham (Syria or the Levant). Isis, or Isil, was born.

What's in a name?

Image copyright Alamy Image caption IS flag: Arabic text of the first part of ""shahada"", the basic statement of the Islamic faith, and the seal of the Prophet below it

During the short and turbulent period over which it has imposed itself as a major news brand, so-called Islamic State has confused the world with a series of name changes reflecting its mutations and changing aspirations, leaving a situation where there is no universal agreement on how to refer to it.

After emerging in Iraq as the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI), its spread to Syria prompted the addition of ""and al-Sham"", a word that can mean Damascus, Syria, or the wider Levant

Many chose to use the easy acronym Isis, with the ""S"" standing either for Syria or al-Sham, though the US administration and others opted for Isil (the ""l"" standing for ""Levant""). Both are still widely used though technically outdated

In Arabic the same acronym can come out as Daash, sometimes spelled Daesh in English; it has passed into common usage among many Arabs, but is disliked by the organisation itself, which sees it as disrespectful of the ""state""; although Daash has no meaning in Arabic, it also has an unpleasant sound to it, which may be why American and Western officialdom often use it

After further expansion of territory and ambitions, the movement dropped geographical specificity and called itself simply ""the Islamic State""; Much of the world was politically reluctant simply to call it that, for fear of implying legitimacy

The BBC and others have generally opted for calling it the ""self-styled"" or ""so-called"" Islamic State on first reference, and IS thereafter

But Julani rebelled, and renewed his oath of loyalty to al-Qaeda's global leadership, now under Ayman al-Zawahiri following Bin Laden's death in 2011. Zawahiri ordered Baghdadi to go back to being just the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI) and leave al-Nusra as the al-Qaeda Syria franchise.

It was Baghdadi's turn to ignore orders from head office.

Before 2013 was out, Isis and al-Nusra were at each other's throats. Hundreds were killed in vicious internecine clashes which ended with Isis being driven out of most of north-west Syria by al-Nusra and allied Syrian rebel factions. But Isis took over Raqqa, a provincial capital in the north-east, and made it its capital. Many of the foreign jihadists who had joined al-Nusra also went over to Isis, seeing it as tougher and more radical. In early 2014, al-Qaeda formally disowned Isis.

Isis had shaken off the parental shackles. But it had lost a lot of ground, and was bottled up. One of its main slogans, Remaining and Expanding, risked becoming empty. So where next?

Fortune smiled once more. Back in Iraq, conditions had again become ripe for the jihadists. The Americans had gone, since the end of 2011. Sunni areas were again aflame and in revolt, enraged by the sectarian policies of the Shia Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki. Sunnis felt marginalised, oppressed and angry.

Image copyright Alamy Image caption An IS fighter waves a flag while standing on a captured government fighter jet in Raqqa, Syria, 2015

When Isis decided to move, it was pushing at an open door. In fact, it had never really left Iraq, just gone into the woodwork. As it swept through Sunni towns, cities and villages with bewildering speed in June 2014, sleeper cells of salafist jihadists and ex-Saddamist militants and other sympathisers broke cover and joined the takeover.

With the capture of Mosul, Isis morphed swiftly into a new mode of being, like a rocket jettisoning its carrier. No longer just a shadowy terrorist group, it was suddenly a jihadist army not only threatening the Iraqi state, but challenging the entire world.

The change was signalled on 29 June by the proclamation of the ""Islamic State"", replacing all previous incarnations, and the establishment of the ""caliphate"". A few days later, the newly anointed Caliph Ibrahim, aka Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made a surprise appearance in Mosul in the pulpit of the historic Grand Mosque of Nour al-Din al-Zangi, heavily laden with anti-Crusader associations. He called on the world's Muslims to rally behind him.

By declaring a caliphate and adopting the generic ""Islamic State"" title, the organisation was clearly setting its sights far beyond Syria and Iraq. It was going global.

Announcing a caliphate has huge significance and resonance within Islam. While it remains the ideal, Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders had always shied away from it, for fear of failure. Now Baghdadi was trumping the parent organisation, setting IS up in direct competition with it for the leadership of global jihadism.

A caliphate (khilafa) is the rule or rein of a caliph (khalifa), a word which simply means a successor - primarily of the Prophet Muhammad. Under the first four caliphs who followed after he died in 632, the Islamic Caliphate burst out of Arabia and extended through modern-day Iran to the east, into Libya to the west, and to the Caucasus in the north.

The Umayyad caliphate which followed, based in Damascus, took over almost all of the lands that IS would like to control, including Spain. The Baghdad-based Abbasid caliphate took over in 750 and saw a flowering of science and culture, but found it hard to hold it all together, and Baghdad was sacked by the Mongols in 1258.

Emerging from that, the Ottoman Empire, based in Constantinople (Istanbul), stretched almost to Vienna at its peak, and was also a caliphate, though the distinction with empire was often blurred. The caliphate was finally abolished by Ataturk in 1924.

So when Baghdadi was declared Caliph of the Islamic State, it was an act of extraordinary ambition. He was claiming no less than the mantle of the Prophet, and of his followers who carried Islam into vast new realms of conquest and expansion.

For most Islamic scholars and authorities, not to mention Arab and Muslim leaders, such claims from the chief of one violent extremist faction had no legitimacy at all, and there was no great rush to embrace the new caliphate. But the millennial echoes it evoked did strike a chord with some Islamic romantics - and with some like-minded radical groups abroad.

Four months after the proclamation, a group of militants in Libya became the first to join up by pledging allegiance to Baghdadi, followed a month later by the Ansar Beit al-Maqdis jihadist faction in Egypt's Sinai. IS's tentacles spread deeper into Africa in March 2015 when Boko Haram in Nigeria took the oath of loyalty. Within a year, IS had branches or affiliates in 11 countries, though it held territory in only five, including Iraq and Syria.

It was in those two core countries that Baghdadi and his followers started implementing their state project on the ground, applying their own harsh vision of Islamic rule.

To the outside world, deprived of direct access to the areas controlled by IS, one of the most obvious and shocking aspects of this was their systematic destruction of ancient cultural and archaeological heritage sites and artefacts.

Some of the region's best-known and most-visited sites were devastated, including the magnificent temples of Bel and Baalshamin at Palmyra in Syria, and the Assyrian cities of Hatra and Nimrud in Iraq.

It wasn't just famous archaeological sites that came under attack. Christian churches and ancient monasteries, Shia mosques and shrines, and anything depicting figures of any sort were destroyed, and embellishments removed even from Sunni mosques. Barely a month after taking over Mosul, IS demolition squads levelled the 13th Century shrine of the Imam Awn al-Din, which had survived the Mongol invasion.

All of this was absolutely in line with IS's puritanical vision of Islam, under which any pictorial representation or shrine is revering something other than Allah, and any non-Muslim structures are monuments of idolatry. Even Saudi kings and princes to this day are buried without coffins in unmarked graves.

Image copyright AFP Image caption A video posted to YouTube in 2015 showed destruction of sculpted faces at Hatra

By posting videos of many of these acts which the rest of the world saw as criminal cultural vandalism, IS also undoubtedly intended to shock. In that sense, it was the cultural equivalent of beheading aid workers.

And there was a more practical and profitable side to the onslaught on cultural heritage. In highly organised manner, IS's Treasury Department issues printed permits to loot archaeological sites, and takes a percentage of the proceeds.

That is just the tip of the iceberg of a complex structure of governance and control put in place as IS gradually settled in to its conquests, penetrating into every aspect of people's lives in exactly the same way as Saddam Hussein's intelligence apparatus had done.

Captured documents published by Der Spiegel last year give some idea of the role of ex-Baathist regime men in setting up and running IS in a highly structured and organised way, with much emphasis on intelligence and security.

Media caption How is Islamic State run?

Residents of Sunni strongholds like Mosul and Falluja in Iraq, and Raqqa in Syria, found that IS operatives already knew almost everything about everybody when they moved in and took over in 2014.

At checkpoints, ID cards were checked against databases on laptops, obtained from government ration or employee registers. Former members of the security forces had to go to specific mosques to ""repent"", hand over their weapons and receive a discharge paper.

""At first, all they did was change the preachers in the mosques to people with their own views,"" said a Mosul resident who fled a year later.

""But then they began to crack down. Women who had been able to go bare-headed now had to cover up, first with the headscarf and then with the full face-veil. Men have to grow beards and wear short-legged trousers. Cigarettes, hubble-bubble, music and cafes were banned, then satellite TV and mobile phones. Morals police [hisba] vehicles would cruise round, looking for offenders.""

Media caption Citizen journalists from Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently (RBSS) describe life in the IS-controlled city

A Falluja resident recounted the story of a taxi-driver who had picked up a middle-aged woman not wearing a headscarf. They were stopped at an IS checkpoint, the woman given a veil and allowed to go, while the driver was sent to an Islamic court, and sentenced to two months' detention and to memorise a portion of the Koran. If you fail to memorise, the sentence is repeated.

""They have courts with judges, officials, records and files, and there are fixed penalties for each crime, it's not random,"" said the Falluja resident. ""Adulterers are stoned to death. Thieves have their hands cut off. Gays are executed by being thrown off high buildings. Informers are shot dead, Shia militia prisoners are beheaded.""

Severed heads on park fences: A diary of life under IS

An activist based in Raqqa from a group called Al-Sharqiya 24 has been keeping a diary of what life is like under Islamic State group rule.

Life under ""Islamic State"": Diaries

There are IS departments that carry the organisation's grip into every corner of life, including finance, agriculture, education, transport, health, welfare and utilities.

School curricula were overhauled in line with IS precepts, with history rewritten, all images being removed from schoolbooks and English taken off the menu.

""One thing you can say is this,"" said the Mosul resident. ""There is absolutely no corruption, no wasta (knowing the right people and pulling strings). They are totally convinced they are on the right track.""

Image caption Map, purportedly produced by IS, showing group's aspirational takeover of all lands historically controlled by caliphates and Ottoman Empire

One recent story tells a lot about IS and its ways.

As Iraqi security forces were pressing forward in areas around Ramadi earlier this year, civilians were fleeing the battle - and IS fighters, losing the day, were trying to sneak out too.

Two women, running from the combat zone, approached a police checkpoint.

As they were being waved through to safety, one of the women suddenly turned to the police, pointed at the other, and said : ""This is not a woman. He's an IS emir [commander].""

The police investigated, and it was true. The other woman was a man, who had shaved, and put on makeup and women's clothes. He turned out to be top of the list of wanted local IS commanders.

""When IS arrived, he killed my husband, who was a policeman, raped me, and then took me as his wife,"" the woman told the police.

""I put up with him all this time, waiting to avenge my husband and my honour,"" she said. ""I tricked him into shaving and putting on makeup, then denounced him to the police.""

What is life like for women under IS?

Media caption Nour is a woman from Raqqa, the so-called Islamic State's capital inside Syria

""Nour"" is a woman from Raqqa, the so-called Islamic State's (IS) capital inside Syria. She managed to escape the city and is now a refugee in Europe, where she met up with the BBC.

This story is based on her experiences and those of her two sisters, who are still inside the IS-held city.

Taking on the world

Having taken over vast swathes of territory in Iraq with their lightning offensive in June 2014, the militants might have been expected to calm down and consolidate their gains.

But, like a shark that has to keep moving or else it will die, IS barely paused before initiating a new spiral of provocation and reprisals that was predictably to draw it into active conflict with almost all the major world powers.

Already, the June offensive had threatened the approaches to Baghdad, prompting the Americans to start bringing in hundreds of military advisers and trainers to see how to help the struggling Iraqi army.

Just two months later, the attack on Kurdish areas in the north triggered US air strikes in defence of the Kurdistan capital, Irbil, and then to help stave off the threat of genocide to the Yazidis. Fourteen other nations were to join the air campaign.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters head to the Mosul dam (August, 2014 )

Ten days later, IS beheaded James Foley and the others followed, in line with the doctrine of exemplary brutality as punishment, deterrent and provocation. The most shocking was to come some months later, with the burning alive of the downed Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh. Shock intended.

The US-led bombing campaign was extended to Syria in September 2014 after IS besieged the Kurdish-held town of Kobane on the Turkish border. Coalition air strikes turned the tide there. IS lost hundreds of fighters killed at Kobane and elsewhere. More revenge was called for. IS turned abroad.

From the declaration of the caliphate until early 2016, some 70 terrorist attacks were either carried out or inspired by IS in 20 countries around the globe, from California to Sydney, with an estimated 1,200 victims killed. The attacks carried the same message of punishment, deterrence and provocation as the hostage beheadings, while also demonstrating IS's global reach.

At the same time, they carried through the militants' doctrine of distracting the enemy by setting fires in different locations and making him squander resources on security. For IS, ""the enemy"" is everybody who does not embrace it. The world is divided into Dawlat al-Islam, the State of Islam, and Dawlat al-Kufr, the State of Unbelief.

The most consequential of these atrocities were the downing of a Russian airliner over Sinai on 31 October and the Paris attacks on 13 November, provoking both Russia and France to intensify air strikes on IS targets in Syria.

Had IS gone mad? It seemed determined to take on the whole world. It was goading and confronting the Americans, the Russians, and a long list of others. By its own count, it had a mere 40,000 fighters at its command (other estimates go as low as half that).

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A memorial to the victims of downed Airbus A321, at Pulkovo Airport in Russia, in November 2015

Could it really challenge the global powers and hope to survive? Or can President Barack Obama fulfil his pledge to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" IS?

Final showdown

If there seems to be something apocalyptic about IS's ""bring it on"" defiance, that's because there is.

When the organisation first brought out its online magazine - a major showcase and recruitment tool - just a month after the ""caliphate"" was declared, it was not by chance that it was named Dabiq.

A small town north of Aleppo in Syria, Dabiq is mentioned in a hadith (a reported saying of the Prophet Muhammad) in connection with Armageddon. In IS mythology, it is the scene where a cataclysmic showdown will take place between the Muslims and the infidels, leading to the end of days. Each issue of Dabiq begins with a quote from Abu Musab Zarqawi: ""The spark has been lit here in Iraq, and its heat will continue to intensify - by Allah's permission - until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq.""

Image caption Dabiq - Islamic State's online magazine

The prospect of taking part in that final glorious climax, achieving martyrdom on the path of Allah and an assured place in paradise, is one of the thoughts inspiring those heeding the IS call to jihad.

That could help explain why the organisation seems to enjoy an endless supply of recruits willing to blow themselves to pieces in suicide attacks, which it calls ""martyrdom-seeking operations"" (suicide is forbidden in Islam). Hundreds have died in this way, and they happen virtually daily.

It's one of the elements that makes IS a formidable fighting force that will be hard to destroy even in strictly military terms.

The Baathist legacy at the core of IS

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Former Iraqi army officers have helped organise and direct IS

IS is in many respects a project of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's outlawed Baath party, but now with a different ideology. Former agents or officers of Saddam Hussein's regime dominate its leadership... They represent a battle-hardened and state-educated core that would likely endure (as they have done through US occupation and a decade of war) even if the organisation's middle and lower cadres are decimated.

Is Islamic State invincible?

The head of security and intelligence for the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in northern Iraq, Masrour Barzani, tells the story of a frustrated would-be suicide bomber who screamed at his captors: ""I was just ten minutes away from being united with the Prophet Muhammad!""

""They think they're winners regardless of whether they kill you or they get killed,"" says Barzani. ""If they kill you, they win a battle. If they get killed, they go to heaven. With people like this, it's very difficult to deter them from coming at you. So really the only way to defeat them is to eliminate them.""

Probably for the first time in military history since the Japanese kamikaze squadrons of World War Two, suicide bombers are used by IS not only for occasional terrorist spectaculars, but as a standard and common battlefield tactic.

Virtually all IS attacks begin with one or several suicide bombers driving explosives-rigged cars or trucks at the target, softening it up for combat squads to go in. So much so that the ""martyrdom-seekers"" have been called the organisation's ""air force"", since they serve a similar purpose.

Formidable though that is, IS as a fighting force is much more than a bunch of wild-eyed fanatics eager to blow themselves up. For that, they have Saddam Hussein to thank.

""The core of IS are former Saddam-era army and intelligence officers, particularly from the Republican Guard,"" said an international intelligence official. ""They are very good at moving their people around, resupply and so on, they're actually much more effective and efficient than the Iraqi army are. That's the hand of former military staff officers who know their business.""

""They are very professional,"" adds Masrour Barzani. ""They use artillery, armoured vehicles, heavy machinery etc, and they are using it very well. They have officers who know conventional war and how to plan, how to attack, how to defend. They really are operating on the level of a very organised conventional force. Otherwise they'd be no more than a terrorist organisation.""

The partnership with the ex-Baathists, going back to Zarqawi's early days in Iraq, is clearly a vital component in IS success.

But that does not mean its fighters are invincible on the battlefield. The Kurds in north-east Syria were fighting IS off with no outside help for a year before anybody noticed. And even now, IS makes what would conventionally be seen as costly mistakes.

In December 2015, they lost several hundred fighters in one abortive attack east of Mosul alone, and probably 2,500 altogether that month. In total some 15,000 are estimated to have been killed by Coalition air strikes since August 2014.

But they seem to have little difficulty making up the numbers. With a population of perhaps 10 million acquiescent Sunnis to draw on in Iraq and Syria, most recruiting is done locally. And if IS remains in place, there will soon be a new generation of young militants.

Media caption IS' brainwashing of children

""I didn't join out of conviction,"" says Bakr Madloul, a 24-year-old bachelor who was arrested in December at his home in a Sunni quarter in southern Baghdad and accused of taking part in deadly IS car bomb attacks on mainly Shia areas, which he admits.

Bakr says he was working as a construction foreman in Kurdistan when IS took over Mosul. He was detained for questioning by Kurdish security, and met a militant in jail who persuaded him to go to Mosul, where he joined up with IS and manned a checkpoint until it was hit by a Coalition air strike.

He was then sent back to his Baghdad suburb to help organise car bombings. The explosives-packed vehicles were sent from outside Baghdad, and his job was to place them where he was told by his controller, usually in crowded streets or markets.

Image caption Bakr Madloul (left) pictured during his time as an IS operative

""Only one of the five car bombs I handled was driven by a suicide bomber,"" he says. ""I spoke to him. He was 22 years old, an Iraqi. He believed he would go to paradise when he died. It's the easiest and quickest way to Heaven. They strongly believe this. They would blow themselves up to get to Heaven. There were older ones in their 30s and 40s.""

""I asked my controllers more than once, 'Is it OK to kill women and children?' They would answer, 'They're all the same.' But to me, killing women and children, I didn't feel at all comfortable about that. But once you're in, you're stuck. If you try to leave, they call you a murtadd, an apostate, and they'll kill you or your family.""

Bakr knows he will almost certainly hang. I asked him if he would do the same things over if he had his life again. He laughed.

""Absolutely not. I would get out of Iraq, away from IS, away from the security forces. I took this path without realising the consequences. There is no way back. I see that now.""

Image caption Bakr Madloul knows he will probably be executed

But up in Kurdistan, another IS prisoner, Muhannad Ibrahim, has no such regrets.

A 32-year-old from a village near Mosul with a wife and three children, he was a construction worker for a Turkish company when IS took over the city. Two of his older brothers had died fighting the Americans there in 2004 and 2006. He joined IS without hesitation and was commanding a small detachment when he was captured in a battle with the Kurds.

""We were being oppressed by the Shia, they were always insulting and bothering us,"" he says. ""But that's not the main motivation, religious conviction is more important. All my family is religious, praise be to Allah. I came to IS through my faith and religious principles.""

""If I had my time over again, I would take the same path, the same choices. Because I am convinced by this thing, I have to go to the end. Either I am killed, or Allah will decree some other fate for me.""

Image caption Captured IS fighter Muhannad Ibrahim is unrepentant

Taming Mosul

Defeating IS militarily is less about its own strengths and vulnerabilities than it is about the deficiencies of the forces arrayed against it. IS is as strong as the weaknesses of the failed states whose collapse into ""savagery"" has left room for it to take root and grow.

Iraq and Syria have to be the primary focus, as the commander of Coalition forces, Lt Gen Sean MacFarland, spelled out in February 2016:

""The campaign has three objectives: one, to destroy the Isil parent tumour in Iraq and Syria by collapsing its power centres in Mosul and Raqqa; two, to combat the emerging metastasis of the Isil tumour worldwide; and three, to protect our nations from attack.""

It goes without saying that Coalition air strikes, deadly and effective as they are, have their limitations. Only in co-ordination with cohesive, motivated ground forces can the territory taken by IS be regained. And that's the crippling problem, in both countries.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A Kurdish fighter passes IS graffiti in the town of Sinjar

The Kurds in the north of both Iraq and Syria have made considerable progress in pushing IS back from areas they regard as theirs, with the help of air strikes. But they are neither capable of going all the way, nor should they - in both countries, they would stir up acute communal sensitivities in the Sunni Arab areas where IS is rooted.

Pro-government forces in Iraq have largely dislodged IS from Diyala province and the Tikrit area north of the capital, but that was mainly the work of Iranian-backed Shia militias who leapt to the defence of Baghdad and the south as IS advanced southwards in June 2014 after the army collapsed.

Using them in mainly Sunni areas is fraught with risk.

Ramadi, the provincial capital of al-Anbar to the west, was recaptured at the end of 2015 in an offensive spearheaded by the government's US-built Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS), with the Shia militias kept out of this Sunni stronghold. But the CTS has limited numbers and has been badly battered. And Ramadi was left in ruins, its entire population fled.

Image copyright AFP Image caption February 2016: Iraqi forces on the outskirts of Ramadi

All of which does not augur well for the sound retrieval of remaining Sunni hotbeds where IS is dug in in Iraq, such as Falluja - barely 30 miles from Baghdad - and above all, Mosul, 10 times the size of Ramadi.

Surprisingly, given the presence of literally hundreds of competing rebel factions, it's in Syria that the chances of making serious progress against IS may be greater, though still not great.

The IS imperative has spurred all the outside parties involved there, including the Americans and the Russians and their regional and local allies, for the first time to put serious weight behind a truce and a negotiated settlement between rebels and regime.

The idea and driving motive is that all parties would then be free to turn on IS, and, to be consistent, also al-Nusra Front, because it belongs to al-Qaeda. It may seem like a long shot, but the US seems to be pushing very hard indeed, making things happen that have resisted for nearly five years.

If all the parties - the rebel groups, the Kurds, regime troops and militias, and their outside allies including the Coalition and the Russians - can somehow be reconciled and turned against IS, its chances of surviving for long in Syria would not be great.

Its only real conurbation there is Raqqa. It is much less deeply embedded in the Sunni population in Syria than in Iraq. Disgruntled Syrian Sunnis have many other vehicles for pressing their grievances against the regime.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The Iraqi army is preparing for operations to re-take the city of Mosul

So it keeps coming back again to Iraq, and specifically, to Mosul. Ten times the size of Raqqa. And that's not the only reason for its significance.

""Mosul is the beating heart of IS,"" says a senior western official in northern Iraq. ""IS is essentially an Iraqi creation. The tragic reality is that at the moment, it is the main Sunni political entity in Iraq. From the West, it's looked at as a kind of crazed cult. It's not. Here in Iraq it represents an important constituency. It represents a massive dissatisfaction, the alienation of a whole sector of the population.""

""That's not to say that the people in Mosul are enthusiastic about IS, but for them, it's better than anything that comes from Baghdad.""

The word in both Baghdad and northern Iraq is that the Americans are pushing seriously hard for a Mosul campaign by the end of 2016, with President Obama's departure in mind. That may not be possible, given the difficulties involved in assembling credible ground forces, as well as severe financial crises affecting both Baghdad and Kurdistan.

Image copyright EPA Image caption The Al-Noori Al-Kabeer mosque in Mosul

But if it does go ahead, the fear is that wrongly-conceived short-term victory, if it is achieved, will turn into long-term disaster, given the total lack of national reconciliation between Sunnis and Shia in the wake of the sectarian carnage that followed Saddam's overthrow in 2003.

Sunni grievances in Iraq are such that if IS did not exist, it would have to be invented. Without reconciliation and a sense of Sunni empowerment and partnership in a national project, IS in some shape or form will always be there, just as the Taliban are now resurgent in Afghanistan despite everything that was done to oust them.

But the Iraqi expert on radical movements, Hisham al-Hashemi, believes that IS could be badly damaged if the Coalition succeed in one of their top-priority tasks - to kill Abu Bakr Baghdadi.

Leaders have been killed before, and replaced with little obvious effect on the course of history. But Hashemi believes Baghdadi is different.

""IS' future depends on Baghdadi,"" he says. ""If he is killed, it will split up. One part would stay on his track and announce a new caliphate. Another would split off and return to al-Qaeda. Others would turn into gangs following whoever is strongest.""

""The source of his strength is that he brought about an ideological transformation, blending jihadist ideas with Baathist intelligence security methods, enabling him to create this quasi-state organisation.""

Hashemi believes only Baghdadi can hold it together. There have been numerous false reports of him being hit, but he appears to be stubbornly and elusively still alive, not seen in public since that mosque appearance in early July 2014.

The Americans are unlikely to rest until they have killed Baghdadi, not least because of their belief that he personally repeatedly raped an American NGO worker, Kayla Mueller, and then had her killed in early 2015.

But even if they do get him, and even if IS does break up, the Sunni problem in Iraq will not go away.

Capitalising on chaos

IS is in any case spreading its bets and developing other territorial options. At present, Libya looks the most promising. It has just the kind of failed-state anarchy, the ""savagery"", that leaves room for the jihadists to move in, forging alliances with local militants and disgruntled supporters of the overthrown regime. Just like Iraq.

IS signalled its arrival there in typical style, issuing a polished video in February 2015 showing a group of 21 bewildered Egyptian Christian workers in orange jumpsuits being beheaded on a Libyan beach, their blood mingling with the waters of the Mediterranean as a warning to the ""crusader"" European countries on the other side.

The man who voiced that warning was believed to be the IS leader in Libya, an Iraqi called Wissam al-Zubaydi, aka Abu Nabil. By coincidence, Zubaydi was killed in a US air strike on the same day IS struck terror in Paris, 13 November 2015.

The man sent by IS to replace him, Abu Omar al-Janabi, was another Iraqi and former Baathist with a tough reputation and a knack for generating revenue - clearly with one eye on Libya's oil facilities, given the damage wrought by Coalition bombing on the organisation's exploitation of fields in Iraq and Syria.

Image copyright AP Image caption An image from a video, posted online by Libyan IS supporters, showing ""Islamic police"" in the city of Sirte

The US and allies have been powerless to halt IS advances in Libya, taking over a big stretch of the coast around the central city of Sirte, which was to (overthrown) Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi what Tikrit was to Saddam Hussein. Another American air strike in February killed (among nearly 50 other people) Noureddine Chouchane, reputedly an IS figure responsible for the deadly attacks on Western tourists in his native Tunisia next door.

With little prospect of a national unity government to end Libya's chaotic fragmentation and provide partners on the ground, such remote strikes - which sometimes act as powerful recruiters for the militants - are about all the frustrated Western powers can do as IS takes root and spreads.

There are other possibilities already beckoning - Yemen, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia... wherever there are dysfunctional states and angry Muslims, there are opportunities for IS, competing strongly with a diminished al-Qaeda as a dominant brand in the jihadist market. Adding the extra risk for the West, that that competition could be another spur for spectacular terrorist attacks which they know are being actively plotted.

Battle for minds

In the first 18 months after the declaration of the ""Islamic State"", the number of foreign fighters making their way to join jihad in Syria and Iraq rose dramatically. The New York-based security consultancy Soufan Group estimated that 27,000 foreign jihadists had made the trip from 86 countries, more than half of them from the Middle East and North Africa.

Clearly, the caliphate had appeal, despite - perhaps in some cases because of - its graphically publicised brutality. A tribute to its extraordinary skill in using the internet and social media as a propaganda and grooming tool.

Ten months after vowing to ""degrade and ultimately destroy"" the organisation, President Obama ruefully acknowledged that IS ""has been particularly effective at reaching out to and recruiting vulnerable people around the world including here in the United States, and they are targeting Muslim communities around the world"".

And he put his finger on the real challenge, monumentally greater than the comparatively simple task of defeating IS militarily:

""Ideologies are not defeated with guns, they are defeated by better ideas, a more attractive and more compelling vision,"" he said.

The complex art of IS propaganda

Image copyright IS image

On a relatively normal day... there was a total of 50 distinct pieces of propaganda. The photo reports and videos included depictions of an IS offensive in northern Syria and eulogies for the dead in Salahuddin... Overwhelmingly, though, the propagandists were preoccupied with a carefully refined view of 'normal' life.

Fishing and ultraviolence

The problem is that when disenchanted people in the region look around them - especially the young, the idealistic, or the hopeless unemployed who have no future - they see scant evidence of ""better ideas"" or attractive and compelling visions.

They see the ruins of an ""Arab Spring"" which raised hopes only to dash them cruelly.

The brutal, corrupt dictatorships which it shook have either fragmented into chaos and sectarian and tribal upheaval, like Syria itself, Libya, Yemen and (with Western intervention) Iraq, or the ""deep states"" of their former regimes came back, even more harshly in the case of Egypt, more gently in the case of Tunisia.

While many of the European jihadists may have heeded the call for other reasons, socio-economic factors play an important part in radicalising some of the Arab jihadists, and will continue to do so unless addressed.

Why IS still attracts recruits from Europe

Image copyright West Midlands Police Image caption Tareena Shakil, who took her toddler son to Syria to join IS, was jailed after returning to the UK

The flow of recruits, both fighters and families, leaving their homes in Europe to live under so-called Islamic State rule in Raqqa in Syria has slowed dramatically.

""It reached its peak in 2013-14, when it was far easier for jihadists to cross the 822km-long (510-mile) Turkey-Syria border, when IS propaganda on social media went largely unchallenged, and when IS was on a roll militarily, seizing ever more territory across northern Syria and north-western Iraq.

""While all three of those factors have now changed to the detriment of IS, the underlying factors propelling young Britons and Europeans towards joining the group have not gone away. So what are they?

Islamic State: What is the attraction for young Europeans?

One of the biggest contingents is from Tunisia, where a detailed survey in the poorest suburbs of the capital showed clearly that the radicalisation of young people there had far less to do with extreme Islamic ideology as such than it did with unemployment, marginalisation and disillusion after a revolution into which they threw themselves, but which gave them nothing, and left them hopeless.

IS is also filling a desert left by the collapse of all the political ideologies that have stirred Arab idealists over the decades. Many used to travel to the Soviet Union for training and tertiary education, but communism is now seen as a busted flush. Arab socialism and Arab nationalism that caused such excitement in the 1950s and 1960s mutated into brutal, corrupt ""republics"" where sons were groomed to inherit power from their fathers.

In this vacuum, IS took up the cause of punishing the West and other outsiders for their actions in the region over the past century:

the carve-up by the colonial powers 100 years ago, drawing a border between Iraq and Syria which IS has now erased

the creation of Israel under the British mandate for Palestine, and its subsequent unswerving political and financial support by the US

Western (and indeed Russian) backing for corrupt and tyrannical Arab regimes

the Western invasion and destruction of Iraq on the flimsiest of pretexts, with the death of uncounted thousands of Iraqis

the Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo prisoner abuse scandals....

The roots of IS also lie in a crisis within Islam.

""Isil is not Islamic,"" said President Obama, echoing statements by many western leaders that ""IS has nothing to do with Islam"".

It has.

""It is based on Islamic texts that are reinterpreted according to how they see it,"" says Ahmad Moussalli, professor of politics at the American University of Beirut. ""I don't say they are not coming out of Islamic tradition, that would be denying facts. But their interpretation is unusual, literal sometimes, very much like the Wahhabis.""

Hisham al-Hashemi, the Iraqi expert on radical groups, agrees.

""Violent extremism in IS and the salafist jihadist groups is justified, indeed blessed, in Islamic law texts relied on by IS and the extremist groups. It's a crisis of religious discourse, not of a barbaric group. Breaking up the religious discourse and setting it on the right course is more important by far than suppressing the extremist groups militarily.""

Because ancient texts can be interpreted by extremists to cover their worst outrages does not implicate the entire religion, any more than Christianity is defined by the Inquisition, where burning at the stake was a stock penalty.

Extremist ideas remain in the dark, forgotten corners of history unless their time comes. And IS time came, with Afghanistan, Iraq, and everything that followed.

""Salafism is spreading in the world, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, the Arab countries,"" says Prof Moussalli.

He blames the Saudis for stifling the emergence of a moderate, democratic version of Islam, the ""alternative Islamic discourse"" to salafism that President Obama would like to see.

""A moderate Islamic narrative today is a Muslim Brotherhood narrative, which has been destroyed by the Gulf states supporting the military coup in Egypt,"" says Prof Moussalli, referring to the Egyptian military's ousting of the elected President Mohammed Morsi, a senior Muslim Brotherhood figure, in July 2013.

""We lost that opportunity with Egypt. Egypt could have paved the way for real change in the area. But Saudi Arabia stood against it, in a very malicious way, and destroyed the possibility of changing the Arab regimes into more democratic regimes that accept the transfer of power peacefully. They don't want it.""

Saudi Arabia's ultra-conservative Wahhabi religious establishment and its constant propagation have raised ambiguity over its relations with radical groups abroad. Enemies and critics have accused it of producing the virulent strain of Wahhabism that inspires the extremists, and even of supporting IS and other ultra-salafist groups.

But Jamal Khashoggi, a leading Saudi journalist and writer who spent time in Afghanistan and knew Bin Laden, says that simply is not true

""We are at war with IS, which sees us as corrupt Wahhabis."" he says.

""IS is a form of Wahhabism that has been suppressed here since the 1930s. It resurfaced with the siege of the Grand Mosque in Mecca in 1979 and spread here and there. But Saudi Arabia didn't back it at all, it saw it as a threat. So it's true that salafism can turn radical, just as the US right-wing produces some crazy lunatics.""

Hundreds of people died in a two-week siege when extremist salafists took over the Grand Mosque, the holiest place in Islam, in protest at what they saw as the Kingdom's deviation from the true path.

More recently, Saudi Arabia's security forces and its Shia minority have in fact been the target of attacks by IS, and the kingdom has executed captured militants. It has an active deradicalisation programme.

Media caption Saudi Arabia's 'creative approach' to deradicalisation

But Mr Khashoggi agrees that the Saudis made a huge mistake when they backed the overthrow of the elected Muslim Brotherhood president in Egypt and the subsequent crackdown on the movement, which has pushed political Islam into the arms of the radicals.

""There were no pictures of Isis, Bin Laden or al-Qaeda in Tahrir Square,"" he says. ""It was an opportunity for democracy in the Middle East, but we made a historical blunder for which we are all paying now.""

But the Kingdom's extreme conservatism, its distaste for democracy, and its custodianship of the shrines in Mecca and Medina to which millions of Muslims make pilgrimage every year, have made it one of the main targets for calls for an unlikely reformation within Islam as part of the battle to defeat IS and other extremist groups.

""We must accept the fact that Islam has a crisis,"" says a senior Sunni politician in Iraq.

""IS is not a freak. Look at the roots, the people, the aims. If you don't deal with the roots, the situation will be much more dangerous. The world has to get rid of IS, but needs a new deal: reformation, in Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, al-Azhar [the ancient seat of Sunni Islamic learning and authority in Cairo].""

""You can't kill all the Muslims, you need an Islamic reformation. But Saudi and Qatari money is blotting out the voices so we can't get anywhere. It's the curse of the Arab world, too much oil, too much money.""

Regional rivalry

IS is at the heart of yet another of the region's burning themes - the strategic geopolitical contest, the game of nations, that is taking place as Syria and Iraq disintegrate.

When the US-led coalition destroyed the Iraqi state in 2003, it was breaking down the wall that was containing Iran, the region's Shia superpower, seen as a threat by the Saudis and most of their Sunni Gulf partners since its Islamic revolution in 1979.

Iran had for years been backing anti-Saddam Iraqi Shia factions in exile. Through those groups, the empowerment of the majority Shia community in Iraq after 2003 gave Iran unrivalled influence over Iraqi politics.

The arrival of the IS threat led to even more Iranian penetration, arming, training and directing the Shia militia who rose in defence of Baghdad and the South.

""If it weren't for Iran, the democratic experiment in Iraq would have fallen,"" says Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Iranian-backed Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups.

""Obama was sleeping, and he didn't wake up until IS was at the gates of Erbil. When they were at the gates of Baghdad, he did nothing. Were it not for Iran's support, IS would have taken over the whole Gulf, not just Iraq.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Hadi al-Ameri, leader of the Badr Organisation, one of the biggest Shia fighting groups

For Saudi Arabia and its allies, Iranian penetration in Iraq threatens to establish, indeed largely has, a Shia crescent, linking Iran, Iraq, Syria under its minority Alawite leadership, and Lebanon dominated by the Iranian-created Shia faction Hezbollah.

From the outset of the war in Syria, the Saudis and their Gulf partners, and Turkey, backed the Sunni rebels in the hope that the overthrow of Assad would establish Sunni majority rule.

So then a north-south Sunni axis running from Turkey through Syria to Jordan and Saudi Arabia would drive a stake through the heart of the Shia crescent and foil the Iranian project, as they saw it.

That is essentially what IS did in 2014 when it moved back into Iraq, took Mosul and virtually all the country's Sunni areas, and established a Sunni entity which straddled the suddenly irrelevant border with Syria, blocking off Shia parts of Iraq from Syria.

If IS had just stayed put at that point and dug in, who would have shifted them? Had they not gone on to attack the Kurds, the Americans would not have intervened. Had they not shot down a Russian airliner and attacked Paris, the Russians and French would not have stepped up their involvement.

""Had they not become international terrorists and stayed local terrorists, they could have served the original agenda of dividing the Arab east so there would be no Shia crescent,"" says Prof Moussalli.

We may never know why they did it. Perhaps their virulent strain of salafism just had to keep going: Remaining and Expanding.

Could they now just row back and settle in to their ""state"", stop antagonising people, and eventually gain acceptance, just as Iran has after its own turbulent revolution and international isolation?

It seems unlikely, for the same driving reasons that they made that escalation in the first place. And even if IS wanted to, the Americans also seem set on their course, and they have proven implacable in their pursuit of revenge for terrorist outrages.

But what is the alternative? Given the problem of assembling capable ground forces, can the Americans be complicit in a takeover of Mosul by Iranian-backed Shia militias, and of Raqqa by Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian regime forces or other non-Sunni groups like the Kurds? Is their hostility to IS so strong that they would watch the Iranians connect up their Shia crescent? And would the Saudis and Turks go along with that?

There are no easy answers to any of the challenges posed by IS in all the strands of crisis that it brings together.

That's why it's still there.

bbc.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,My date with Michelangelo,['Sophie Hardach'],"On the fourth floor of the British Museum, in a quiet corner far from the mummies and the Rosetta Stone, is an unremarkable door. Most visitors simply walk past it. I first opened the door a few years ago, clutching a piece of paper with some scribbled directions. I was certain the guards would rush over to explain that this area was closed to the public.

Instead, after a brief ID check, I was ushered into a room with a vaulted glass ceiling, elegantly carved gallery and cabinets stacked with cardboard boxes. Those boxes hold Britain's national collection of prints and drawings. Two million prints and 50,000 drawings are stored here, from a Virgin and Child etching by Rembrandt to a drawing of a philosopher by Michelangelo. The museum describes it as one of the world's top three collections of its kind.

It is Londons most democratic and accessible collection of masterpieces. But no one I have mentioned it to has heard of it

But unlike most other art collections, this one is not locked away. Instead, the British Museums Study Room is London's most democratic and accessible collection of masterpieces. Any member of the public can walk in and ask to see the works. Visitors don't need a membership card, a reader's pass or a letter supporting their research project. They don't have to keep a safe distance from the art to prevent the alarm from going off.

But no one I have mentioned it to has heard of it. In fact, people tend to express surprise that a place like that even exists  a place where anyone can be granted a rendezvous with Rembrandt.

Secret studies

London has many secret sanctuaries, but none are quite as magical as its hidden study or reading rooms. Many museums will have one; some are very grand indeed. With its chandeliers and ornate ceiling, the reading room of the National Art Library at the Victoria & Albert Museum could be mistaken for a ballroom.

On a more intimate scale, the genteel reading room at the London Library in St James's Square has attracted book lovers for almost two centuries. AS Byatt honoured it in the opening scene of her best-selling novel Possession: ""It was shabby but civilised, alive with history but inhabited also by living poets and thinkers who could be found squatting on the slotted metal floors of the stacks, or arguing pleasantly at the turning of the stair."" The prints and drawings room at the British Museum is filled with a similar atmosphere  a sense of creative correspondence across the centuries.

London has many secret sanctuaries, but none are quite as magical as its hidden study or reading rooms

At the time of my first visit, I was working on my second novel. One of my characters was an art student in 1930s London and I was trying to find a way of expressing the eras extreme contrasts through his art. On the one hand, the 1920s and early 30s were years of creative innovation and great optimism. At the same time, the rise of fascism cast a dark shadow.

Since the character was young and penniless, I was particularly interested in linoprint, a cheap, accessible medium that encouraged experimentation. However, prints are usually not given much space in museums, where the focus tends to be on crowd-pulling paintings. Where in London could I find those elusive smaller works? The British Museums Study Room.

I first requested a selection of prints from the Grosvenor School of Modern Art, founded in Pimlico in 1925. The Grosvenor School is not as well-known as the German Bauhaus or the Italian Futurists but its artists shared a similar fascination with urban technology, new materials and sliced-up perspectives. Their lino prints chronicled the exhilaration, speed and energy of London life.

The archivist returned with a set of white gloves and the prints, the most striking of which were two linocuts from 1934 by the Grosvenor School artist Cyril Power, The Tube Train and Exam Room. Studying a work of art in your own time, at a desk, is a very different experience from looking at it in a museum or a gallery: for a start, it is much closer to how the artists themselves would have viewed the work.

I was instantly drawn into the images, which decades after their creation still felt fresh, immediate and relevant. Sure, the passengers in The Tube Train wore top hats and held newspapers rather than phones. But the packed-in claustrophobia, the way the passengers sat pinned into their seats as their carriage hurtled through the dark, was recognisable to any modern-day London commuter.

Visitors may ask to see any print or drawing  apart from a fragile sketchbook by Italian Renaissance painter Jacopo Bellini

According to the museum's website, visitors may ask to see any print or drawing  apart from a fragile sketchbook by the Italian Renaissance painter Jacopo Bellini, which can only be viewed by special request. But relatively few people seem to find their way here. Conservators are probably grateful for that: even as I was appreciating the 1930s prints, I knew I was harming them, if ever so slightly. Every time they are taken from their protective folders and exposed to light, the prints fade a little  imperceptibly at first, more noticeably over decades.

But there is no substitute for looking at an original. No screen image can quite replace the time-travel feel of being in the presence of the work itself.

Renaissance rendezvous

Having travelled to the 1930s, I was struck by the idea that I could venture even further back in time. I asked the archivist if I could see Michelangelo's ink drawing of the philosopher.

The sketch shows a bearded, cloaked man holding a roundish object: perhaps a rock, a crystal or a skull. That the drawing was unfinished made it more interesting. Was the figure an old man contemplating mortality, an alchemist weighing a fresh lump of gold, a philosopher turning over the stone of wisdom?

I looked at it until the archivist told me they were about to close for the day.

On my way home, I was caught up in London's rush hour. But instead of my usual frustration over the crowded tube, I felt a flicker of modernist love for this hurtling metal beast. And back at my desk, struggling with my manuscript, I decided to see Michelangelo's drawing as a metaphor for creative work: all of us turning over this mysterious thing in our hands, interpreting it in different ways.

Since that first visit, I have gone back to the study room several times, usually to look at works from the period I am researching. Very occasionally, I ask for the Michelangelo drawing. Not too often: I know that it prefers to be in the dark. But I also like to think that, every now and then, it enjoys being looked at.

A Canadian member of parliament diagnosed with a disease that has taken his voice was honoured as ""speaker for a day"" in the House of Commons.

Mauril Belanger, a Liberal MP who was aiming to become Speaker of the House, learned last year he has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Colleagues from all sides applauded as he made his way to the Speaker's seat, where he used an iPad to ""speak"".

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among many who paid tribute.

""Mauril is a dear friend who helped me a lot in my first years as a parliamentarian, with both stern words and strong support,"" he said.

""He's a man who takes his parliamentary and constituency responsibilities extremely seriously.""

Mr Trudeau teared up as Mr Belanger passed down the Hall of Honour in the House of Commons, CBC reporter Hannah Thibedeau tweeted.

An editorial in the Ottawa Citizen praised the ""rare show of solidarity"" on Parliament Hill.

No centro das Ilhas Reuniao, uma pequena possessao francesa no oceano Indico, encontra-se uma outra especie de ""ilha"". Esta, ainda mais isolada.

Formada apos o colapso de um vulcao ha 3 milhoes de anos, o Circulo de Mafate e separado do resto de Reuniao por imensos paredoes rochosos, montanhas impressionantes e uma densa floresta tropical.

A unica maneira de sair deste vale em forma de anfiteatro e a pe - ou de helicoptero.

Unesco

Os primeiros habitantes chegaram a cratera vulcanica no seculo 18. Essa primeira leva era composta de escravos fugitivos. Mais tarde vieram fazendeiros franceses empobrecidos pelo efeito do fim da escravidao em suas plantacoes. Por geracoes, eles e seus descendentes viveram isolados do mundo.

Mafate hoje tem menos de 800 habitantes. Eles vivem em pequenas aldeias chamadas ilets. Praticamente todos os moradores sao descendentes dos colonos originais e cada aldeia nao tem mais do que dois ou tres casebres com teto de zinco.

Image copyright Alamy Image caption Mafate e tao remota que suprimentos precisam chegar de helicoptero

Nao ha eletricidade ou agua encanada no vale de aproximadamente 100 km. Medicos, policiais e outros profissionais, quando necessarios no local, fazem de longas caminhadas para chegar la ou viajam em aeronaves de emergencia.

Em 2010, a Unesco deu a Mafate status de patrimonio cultural da humanidade, uma decisao que criou um fluxo de turistas - Reuniao e mais conhecida pelos surfistas. Visitantes tem acesso a vistas deslumbrantes, florestas, planicies e rios selvagens, alem de uma rica cultura local.

Assim como o arquipelago de Galapagos, no oceano Pacifico, a Reuniao tem uma profusao de fauna e flora exclusiva. E Mafate e um dos poucos lugares do mundo em que ha um ecossistema desenvolvido ao longo de milhoes de anos em relativo isolamento. O vale tem uma serie de passaros, insetos e plantas so encontrados por la.

Felizmente, caminhar - basicamente a unica opcao disponivel para visitantes - e a melhor maneira de conhecer Mafate. No entanto, as centenas de quilometros de trilhas nao sao para gente inexperiente ou que sofre de vertigem. Nao devem ser percorridas sem companhia.

O vale e acessivel por uma serie de rotas, algumas lidando por passagens montanhosas para la de ingremes, e que funcionam como ""estradas"".

Image copyright Alamy Image caption La Nouvelle esta no centro de Mafate

As trilhas so nao sao tediosas: vistas deslumbrantes se alternam com passagens por mata densa e rios cuja agua nao raramente chega a cintura. Fica a impressao de que o caminhante cruza cenas geograficas diferentes.

bbc.com,,Japan's tsunami debris: Five remarkable stories,[],"Image copyright NOAA

It was a gloomy, grey day in the middle of the Pacific Ocean in the summer of 2012. There was a small white blip, persistent on the horizon.

At first they thought it was a whale, but as they got closer they realised it was a large abandoned fishing boat with Japanese characters on the side.

""That is when everything changed. This belonged to someone, this is someone's property,"" recalls Marcus Eriksen, a marine conservationist who led a 2012 expedition to survey the vast volume of debris cast into the ocean by a massive earthquake-triggered tsunami that hit Japan's north-eastern coast on 11 March 2011.

The disaster killed almost 16,000 people and saw a vast amount of material washed out to sea - about 20 million tonnes, the Japanese government has estimated.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Whole towns were washed away in the disaster

Much of it sank, but five years on some of it is still washing up along the North American coast, from Alaska to Hawaii. Since September 2015, 64 items have been washed ashore and officially identified as tsunami debris.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Marine Debris Programme, based in Hawaii, has worked closely with the Japanese government, through local consulates, to identify these items. In the years since the disaster there have been extraordinary stories of objects washing up on these distant shores, some of which have later been reconciled with their owners.

Motorcycle

A Harley-Davidson motorcycle was found on Graham Island, in British Columbia in Canada, in the container that its Japanese owner, Ikio Yokohama, had used to store it back in Japan.

Peter Mark, the man who discovered it in April 2012, realised it had a Japanese number plate attached and might be tsunami debris, and so it was traced.

Media caption Ikio Yokoyama: ""When I looked at the picture he took, I knew immediately it was my bike""

After considering offers to ship the bike back to Japan to be restored, its owner decided it should be exhibited at the Harley-Davidson Museum in Milwaukee, USA, as a memorial to those whose lives were touched by the disaster.

Mr Yokoyama lost several family members himself in the tsunami.

Village sign

Tanohata village was devastated by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Much of the town in Iwate prefecture was swept out into the ocean.

Among that sea of debris was a wooden sign. Nearly three metres (10 feet) long, it bore the name of the wooden apartment building it came from - ""Shimanokoshi village housing"".

It was found in October 2013, some 6,000 km (3,728 miles) away, on Kahuku Beach, Oahu Island, Hawaii. And in July 2014 it was flown home.

Image copyright NOAA Image caption US state and federal authorities co-operated in the return of the sign

With its return, the people of the village ""are slowly but surely walking on the path to recovery as a united body"", said its mayor, Hiroshi Ishihara.

The village has exhibited the sign, as a reminder for future generations.

Football

Misaki Murakami, 16, lost everything he owned when the tsunami swept away his home in Rikuzentakata.

But little more than a year later, on the shores of Middleton Island, Alaska, David and Yumi Baxter found a football that he had been given by classmates when he moved schools several years before. Being Japanese, Ms Baxter was able to translate the name, school and ""good luck"" message on the ball, helping to reunite it with its owner.

Media caption Survivor talks about recovering football taken to Alaska after tsunami

""I was shocked, but also I've yet to recover a single one of my belongings, so I'm really happy about this,"" said Misaki on recovering the ball.

Rowing boat

Image copyright NOAA

A rowing boat, or skiff, was found on 7 April 2013 on the shores of Crescent City, California.

The boat, called Kamome (Seagull), belonged to a high school in Rikuzentakata, which was completely flattened by the wave that hit the town just over two years before.

Image copyright Del Norte High School

Cleaning it of the barnacles that covered it, pupils at Del Norte High School worked with officials in Japan and the US to ship it home.

The two schools arranged exchange visits and formally became sister schools. The story of the boat, and the links it helped forge, has even been told in a bilingual illustrated book for young children.

Fishing boat

Image copyright NOAA

One piece of debris which was especially visible, but could not be salvaged, was the crewless ""ghost ship"", which was first spotted off the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia on 23 March 2012, slowly drifting in a maritime transport corridor.

Because of the risk the 164-foot (50-metre) Ryou-Un Maru posed to other shipping, and the difficulties of salvaging it, authorities were left with little choice but to scuttle it.

The squid fishing vessel was sunk about 314 km (195 miles) from Sitka, Alaska, by naval cannon fire.

Image copyright US Coast Guard Image caption It took several bursts of cannon fire to sink the ship

While the biggest items have received the most attention, the vast majority of the debris was smaller, and is getting gradually more so the longer it is at sea.

It is also makes up a large proportion of what remains in the Pacific, as much of it is entirely or mostly sub-surface debris. The items submerged below the water line can only be moved by currents. Some of these items have accumulated in an area called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, a long-standing collection of marine debris.

So the impact of the tsunami is still being felt and measured thousands of miles away from its original focus. People find the objects, scientists log them, oceanographers model them and conservationists assess their impact.

With every object that is found, scientists are given an opportunity to learn more about currents, winds and ocean flow, but the debris also tells stories about the lives touched by the 2011 tsunami.

bbc.com,,Sub-zero survival skills with the US Army in Alaska,[],"Image copyright Ed Gold

The Northern Warfare Training Center in Alaska is where soldiers in the US Army learn how to survive and fight in extreme cold weather. Photographer Ed Gold spent two weeks with the team, shadowing the students as they went on exercises.

The course takes a ""train the trainer"" approach, with soldiers who complete the training passing on their new skills to comrades when they return to their units.

Image copyright Ed Gold

The Alaskan terrain provides a wide range of natural challenges and, at sub-zero temperatures, most tasks are more difficult and take longer.

Image copyright Ed Gold

""We are not a tactics school; we get you ready to operate in cold weather,"" says Lt Col Mick Braun.

""A lot of it is mental toughness. It builds a soldier's toughness so they know they can operate in cold conditions. I'm a firm believer that if a soldier can serve here they can serve anywhere.

The centre also works with other countries whose militaries operate in cold conditions, such as Japan, the Scandinavian countries, Nepal and Mongolia, to build relationships and share knowledge.

Image copyright Ed Gold

Part of the course involves learning how to survive avalanches. Soldiers are taught how to use poles to find those buried in the snow, having first picked up a signal using locator equipment.

Image copyright Ed Gold

""This pit shows that it is important to see what the snow is doing. Look at the layers in the snow,"" says instructor Steven Decker.

""You can get some value out of this, it's a low consequence slope. If this slope was going to slide it wouldn't go very far as it has an inch and a half of 'depth hoar' slab.""

Image copyright Ed Gold

""Whenever you are in this environment stop every three or four hours or so and pay attention to your surroundings. Look up at the clouds to check what the weather is doing. What is the wind doing?""

Image copyright Ed Gold

Decker notes that a lack of snow in this training area shows that the winter has been warmer than normal. Despite the absence of snow the slippery surface still makes the going tricky and tries the patience of soldiers as they practise casualty evacuation using a rescue stretcher.

The belayer further up the slope cannot be relied upon to pull up or lower the casualty on their own. They only brake the rope when the four man team below pause their effort.

Image copyright Ed Gold

Image copyright Ed Gold

To keep warm overnight, trainees build a thermal shelter using wood and parachute cord.

Image copyright Ed Gold

The shelter is then covered with a parachute and snow is piled on top. It provides a warm sleeping area, protected from the wind.

The soldiers are shown how to make the improvised thermal shelter and then given three hours to build their own to share with one or two others. They then spend a night in it, dismantling it early the following morning.

Image copyright Ed Gold

""It's my first winter in Alaska so getting this class really opens my mind,"" says Staff Sgt Ali Baharanyi (right) who was born in Congo and joined the US Army in 2010.

""Most of the time you really don't know how to use the gear to its maximum so we don't always benefit entirely but now with this training I'm going to maximise my understanding and involvement with Alaska.""

Students are also told how to use packed snow to stop bullets. About two metres (6,5ft) of packed snow will stop a 7.62mm bullet, but if the snow is freshly fallen and looser, the width must be doubled.

Image copyright Ed Gold

""We train for sustained operations in an arctic environment,"" says Staff Sgt Ben Kueter (speaking, right).

""I'm confident that we give soldiers a very good knowledge base and that they would be able to operate in any cold region in the world. This Arctic area is brutal and it takes specialised training to be able to survive out here.""

Image copyright Ed Gold

""I want soldiers to thrive in the wild,"" says 2nd Lt Jessica Hayashida (second from right), a student on the course.

""What builds a team more than enduring some awful pain together. We have a really great mentality about it. I think the instructors are incredible. Not only are they proficient and confident but they have a genuine passion.""

Image copyright Ed Gold

Lt Ryan Morrill, Sgt Thomas Trask, Lt Zachary Schroeder, Staff Sgt Noe Saldana and Capt Dave Luce are part of a team training to climb Denali, formerly known as Mt McKinley, the highest peak in North America. Four of the five will be selected to make the ascent in May.

Image copyright Ed Gold

Sgt Bell demonstrates how to use camouflage, wearing an ""overwhite"" top when the elevated mountainside has snow and the ground is bare.

Image copyright Ed Gold

Sgt Joshua Vermote carries the Stars and Stripes on his pack.

""I just got this flag last year - it's flown in Germany, Ireland, Kyrgyzstan, Afghanistan, and it's been through pretty much half the United States,"" says Vermote.

""I put it on my rucksack to boost morale for everybody as I knew it was going to be a physical endeavour for everybody and I believe that when any American sees that flag it boosts morale.""

""Everything on this course is designed for a reason - we had to adapt and overcome and deal with it. I'm deploying to Kuwait and after that I'm hoping to come back here to work as an instructor. I love the cold, born and raised in it. I strongly dislike the heat.""

Image copyright Ed Gold

The squads were timed around a 5km (3 mile) course using snow shoes and carrying their equipment. They were then marked on their collective scores on a 25m (80ft) firing range using 20 rounds each in their M4 Carbine Assault Rifles.

Two fighting positions were adopted, with 10 rounds fired in a crouching position and 10 kneeling, all the time wearing snow shoes.

Kristine Isherwood (far right) is part of a team helping material developers and uniform designers understand the impact of the natural environment on combat clothing.

""You've got to get out from behind your desk and walk with the soldiers to understand what works and what doesn't,"" says Isherwood. ""You will encounter things outdoors that you didn't consider in a lab environment.""

Image copyright Ed Gold

Staff Sgt Rinson Neth (right) is from Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia.

""I was deployed to the mountains of Afghanistan and I wish I had been to this school beforehand.

""Having the knowledge means that we can get dropped anywhere in the world and we'll do well. If you don't have that knowledge it's going to be a bad day for you. I prefer the cold. With cold you can always upgrade but with heat you can't downgrade.""

Image copyright Ed Gold

""We never know where we're going to go next, where we're going to fight. It's extremely valuable to train soldiers in being able to fight in mountainous regions,"" says Sgt First Class Adam McQuiston.

""The course definitely prepares for the mountains and the cold and sets up our soldiers for success in any Arctic environment.

""I have 20 instructors here right now, five medics and the lieutenant and myself,"" he says. ""We're continually busy.""

bbc.com,,Shahbaz Taseer: Why was murdered Pakistan governor's son released?,"['Bbc News', 'M Ilyas Khan']","Image copyright Handout Image caption Shahbaz Taseer was kidnapped from Lahore in 2011

The kidnapped son of murdered Pakistani governor Salman Taseer has been reunited with his family, more than four years after being seized by gunmen in Lahore.

Many questions surround Shahbaz Taseer's abduction and release - and there are few clear answers.

Why was he freed now?

Shahbaz Taseer's release comes barely a week after Pakistan executed Mumtaz Qadri, the police guard who assassinated Salman Taseer (Shahbaz's father) for defending reforms to the country's blasphemy laws.

As such, one would have expected the extremists holding him to use him as an object of their revenge. Instead, he walked free, apparently with the consent of his captors.

There are various theories. Some say that in the wake of Pakistan's military operations in the Waziristan region, the militants were on the run and found it difficult to hold him.

Others believe he was released after ransom was paid to his kidnappers.

More on this story:

Image copyright Reuters

Why did Pakistan keep hard-line mourners off air?

How Punjab governor's killer became a hero

What are Pakistan's blasphemy laws?

Salman Taseer: Death of a liberal

What is the official story of his kidnapping?

Initial reports attributed to Pakistani officials said he was recovered in an ""intelligence-based"" operation conducted by a premier Pakistani intelligence service (a euphemism for the ISI), the intelligence unit of the paramilitary Frontier Corps (FCIU) and Balochistan police's counter-terrorism department (CTD).

A CTD official said they recovered him from a compound in the Kuchlak area, some 25km (16 miles) north of Quetta.

The military's media wing, ISPR, confirmed Mr Taseer's release and promised more details in a subsequent message which was never released, apart from a couple of his pictures, with the ISPR chief assuring readers in a tweet that he was ""hale and hearty"".

What did the restaurant owner say?

Just when the media were desperately looking for reports of a shootout or arrest of kidnappers, some reporters in Quetta got in touch with the owner of a roadside restaurant in Kuchlak.

The owner said that a man with long hair and an overgrown beard had walked into the restaurant at about 5:20pm local time (12:20 GMT) and ordered roasted mutton, a local speciality.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Security forces say they received information Shahbaz Taseer was at this hotel near Quetta

After finishing his food, he paid his bill of 350 rupees (2.35; $3.35). He walked up to the counter and asked for a telephone. The owner told him he didn't have one. He then asked a waiter for his phone, made a call and then sat down at his table.

At about 5.50pm, a motorcade of Frontier Corps pulled up at the side of the restaurant. The man stood up and rushed towards the FC vehicles. Some soldiers put a scarf over his head and put him inside one of the vehicles and drove away, shouting to the people present there to look the other way.

The owner said that when he heard the news of Mr Taseer's release and saw his pictures on TV, he realised who his client was.

The restaurant owner's account was seen by many as evidence that the governor's son was voluntarily set free by his captors, not snatched by the security forces.

Who kidnapped him?

Initial police investigations focused on local business rivals, but a mobile phone found by the police at the spot from where he was kidnapped led in July 2013 to the arrest of two Uzbeks and five Pakistanis.

They were said to have orchestrated the kidnapping of not only Shahbaz Taseer but also of an American aid official, Warren Weinstein, as well as former Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani's son, Haider Gilani.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Pakistan's security services said Mr Taseer, seen here after his release, was 'hale and hearty'

But by then they had passed on their victims to militant groups based in Pakistan's tribal region of Waziristan.

The two Uzbek brothers arrested in July 2013 were said to be members of the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU), while the five Pakistanis were mostly engineering students affiliated with Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a Pakistani sectarian militant group with links to the Pakistani Taliban (TTP), al-Qaeda and its various international affiliates, including the IMU.

Why was he kidnapped?

Many believe that before his release on Tuesday, Shahbaz Taseer was being held by some elements of the TTP, which hosted the IMU in their stronghold of South Waziristan for years.

Extortion and kidnapping for ransom have been a major source of revenue for this entire militant network. Apart from ransom, kidnappings have also been used by these groups to secure the release of their arrested comrades.

Image copyright AFP/Getty Images Image caption Shahbaz Taseer's father Salman was killed for opposing Pakistan's blasphemy laws.

In the past, Pakistani and Afghan governments have both paid ransom and released militants to secure the freedom of at least one Pakistani diplomat and an Afghan diplomat.

In most cases the money changed hands through TTP leaders. In the case of Shahbaz Taseer, there were reports of a higher ransom being demanded which was later reduced to 1bn Pakistani rupees ($10m).

However, haggling went on and some quarters have indicated that the Haqqani network, which despite denials is long believed to have enjoyed support from Pakistan's military establishment, helped mediate a deal involving a lower ransom. It is not clear if any prisoner releases were also part of the agreement.

Why Balochistan? Is there an Afghan connection?

Pakistan has moved against militant sanctuaries in the north-western tribal areas, but northern parts of Balochistan have remained largely untouched.

These areas have been home to a large Afghan refugee population, and to the leadership of the Afghan Taliban called the Quetta Shura.

During the operations in Waziristan, most TTP and IMU militants based in the south of that region spilled over into northern Balochistan.

They have also been able to move across most of the Afghan territory adjacent to the tribal areas and Balochistan.",[]

bbc.com,2016-02-23 00:00:00,The fish that makes long and short-range water missiles,['Alex Riley'],"As a boy, Stefan Schuster would regularly visit his local Zoological Gardens in the German city of Stuttgart for one purpose: to see the archerfish at feeding time. He had read that these denizens of mangrove-lined estuaries in South and South East Asia have a peculiar behaviour for fish. They hunt land-based animals.

With splotches of black across their silvery backs, archerfish blend into the dappled shade cast by the dense foliage above their watery environment. Hidden, they move slowly towards any insects, spiders, or small lizards resting just above the waters surface, carefully positioning themselves for the attack.

Then, after firmly closing their gills, they spit a fine jet of water at their unsuspecting prey, knocking it from its perch. Dinner is served, wriggling and helpless on the waters surface.

Thats in the wild. But in captivity archerfish are usually spoon-fed; their predatory instincts wasted. Despite his efforts, therefore, young Schuster never witnessed an archerfish hunt.

But he never lost hope. Many years later, after receiving his first research position at the University of Freiburg in Germany, he decided to purchase some pet archerfish. There was no scientific interest involved at all, he says. He just had a spare aquarium at the time.

Not only had Schuster seen the archerfish shoot, he was the target

Remembering his childhood travails, he was expecting to have to wait months to see the fish shooting. It actually took a matter of seconds. I just put them into the tank and they fired right away into my nose, Schuster recalls.

Not only had he seen the archerfish shoot, he was the target. Delighted with a childhood dream coming true, he hardly noticed the tinge of pain: the water had stung, like a tiny flick to the nose.

But that minor sting is actually surprisingly difficult to explain. Ever since these fish were first discovered over 250 years ago, biologists have wondered how the archerfishs jet of water packs such a powerful punch. Only in recent years have laboratories around the world finally uncovered the secrets of natures most adept archers.

In 1764, news of an unusual insect-hunting fish native to Batavia (modern-day Jakarta) reached naturalists in Amsterdam. In a short letter, one resident on the island wrote, With a surprising dexterity, it ejects out of its tubular mouth a single drop of water, which never fails striking the fly into the sea, where it becomes its prey.

How could such a small fish project such a powerful missile?

Ichthyologists and naturalists in England werent completely sold on such reports, however. They were too bizarre to believe. Animals of the air  such as birds and bats  will often hunt fish, of course, but residents of the water rarely hunt for prey above the surface. Archerfish not only defied this ecological dogma, but did so without ever leaving their aquatic realm.

As the fish were shipped from mangrove to aquaria in Europe, however, the truth quickly became apparent. The original accounts were correct. From then on the question wasnt if, but how they did it. How could such a small fish  the seven species of archerfish in the Toxotes family rarely grow longer than 10cm  project a missile powerful enough to dislodge well-anchored insects from their perches  or to sting the face of a human, for that matter?

In the 20th Century, biologists took a closer look at the fishs anatomy for clues. First, they dissected, counted, and weighed the muscles within the jaw. Could they account for the jets force?

Not quite. To produce the jet of water, a study published in 1976 concluded, the amount of stress the muscles would be exposed to would be far beyond anything recorded by biologists before. Something else was going on.

What about a catapult mechanism? In such a scenario, energy from slow muscle contraction can be gradually stored in other, more rigid, parts of an animals body, then released all at once  which is what happens when a human archer releases the bows string and fires an arrow. This mechanism is also at the core of the chameleons projectile tongue and the high jump of insects such as grasshoppers, crickets, and planthoppers.

Biologists were stumped. It would take physics to explain the archerfish mystery

One problem: even after several thorough examinations of the fishs skeleton, no such energy storage element came to light. There was simply no piece of bone that seemed like it could double as a catapult.

The theory was well and truly put to bed in 1986 when researchers measured the amount of electrical activity the muscles in the archerfishs jaw produced before and during emitting their water jet. If a catapult mechanism existed, some of the fishs muscles would contract  and produce an electrical charge  generating energy to be stored elsewhere and then released suddenly as the archerfish spits. But the muscles didnt contract this way. The catapult idea was tossed in the bin.

Biologists were stumped. And for good reason. What they didnt know was that their anatomical-based approach to the problem was doomed to fail from the very start. It would take a different branch of science to solve the mystery. A team of physicists was needed.

In 2012, Alberto Vailati, professor of fluid dynamics at the University of Milan, and his colleagues took a look. But not at the fish  they were more interested in the jets of water they fired. In their lab, they carefully tracked the hydrodynamics of the water during its flight from fishs mouth to a fake fly above the surface. And in the process, they were finally able to uncover where the waters mysterious power came from.

Using a high-speed camera, able to take a snapshot every 1,000th of a second, the researchers found that the speed of the water leaving the fishs mouth increased over time. Thats to say, the water leaving the mouth last travelled through the air more quickly than the water that left the mouth first. The water jets tail was playing catch-up with the head.

I cannot think of a weapon developed by a human being which increases its velocity when it approaches the target

It was a key observation. Under normal circumstances a jet of water wont simply fly through the air as one continuous long cylinder  instead it tends to reduce its surface area by separating into smaller water droplets. You can see this process in action when you fire a water pistol. The phenomenon should render the archerfishs weapon useless, because its target would simply be hit by a stream of tame water droplets.

But because the water droplets at the rear are travelling faster than those in front, they push them along. Then they merge.

The tip of the jet acts as a water balloon which gets injected continually, progressively, by the tail of the jet, says Vailati. In this way, you have the development of a single large droplet at the tip of the jet.

Both the speed and size of the super droplet increase as it nears its target. Momentum is maximised. I cannot think of a weapon developed by a human being which increases its velocity when it approaches the target, says Vailati. Thats the most effective way to hit the target.

The archerfishs secret apparently lay in the way it controlled water

In technical detail, the final impact can pack a punch of 3000 watts per kilogram. Vertebrate muscle maxes out at around 500 watts per kilogram. In order to achieve what the fish does with this hydrodynamic amplification, Vailati says, the mass of the muscle inside the mouth would [need to] be at least six times larger in reality.

In other words, the archerfishs secret apparently lay in the way it controlled water  not in any special properties of its muscles or skeleton. Problem solved, then? No more archerfish arcana? Not completely. In 2014, the biologists were back.

After reading the Vailati study, Schuster still thought a vital piece of the puzzle was still missing. He noticed that each archerfish used in the study was trained to target fake prey only 12cm above the waters surface. But in the wild, archerfish are known to have a large shooting range, extended up to 2m.

How do they aim their self-accelerating bullet of water over such a large range? Again, he looked to high-speed cameras for answers. He took a series of snapshots, each 1000ths of a second apart, to study the fishs mouth as it shot out a water jet.

Poring through these images, Schuster and his colleagues noticed something very subtle, and unexpected. When producing a jet of water, the fishs mouth is in constant motion, changing the size of the opening as the water is ejected.

Insects, spiders, or lizards will always feel the full force of the archerfishs jet

To begin with, the mouth gradually becomes larger, allowing an unrestricted release of water. But then, the mouth starts to close again, and the opposite occurs. The opening is smaller, and the liquid has to flow faster, says Vailati, commenting on Schusters work. Like putting your finger over the end of a hosepipe, the water travels faster and further.

By modulating this opening and closing mechanism, archerfish can fine-tune the speed of the jets tail. If the fish waits longer to begin closing its mouth, the fast-travelling tail of the jet is released later, so it will take longer to catch up to the tip.

Thats useful in order to form the powerful super droplet later, to target prey that is farther away. To target prey that is closer, in contrast, the archerfish simply closes its mouth earlier so the super droplet can form sooner. Regardless of how far away they sit, insects, spiders, or lizards will always feel the full force of the archerfishs jet.

Archerfish have crafted something more powerful than is physically possible by their nature alone. By exploiting the physical laws outside of the body, they dont require any specialised apparatus such as large muscles or a catapult mechanism.

They use tools. Just as our ancestors, primate relatives, and some species of crows craft their own wood and stone implements for grooming, hunting, or feeding, archerfish have learned to fashion weapons. They whittle arrows from water. Their material is also the world they swim in. They have unlimited ammo. This allows archerfish to be very trigger-happy, commonly firing in sequential rounds to ensure prey capture.

The parallels between this fish and our own species dont end at tool use. When the archerfish was first described back in the 18th Century, it was dubbed the jaculator fish, in reference to the action of throwing, pitching, or hurling. This antique alias may have been very appropriate. Archerfish spit just like we throw.

Imagine throwing a rock at a target. Now move the target further away. Throw again. If youre a good shot, the swing of your arm and the timing of the rocks release from the hand will be modified according to the targets new position. Speed and precision have to be scaled up. The orchestration of muscles is fine-tuned.

For our ancestors, this approach would have been rewarded with an increase in successful hunts. Hitting more distant targets harder and more often would have required a greater cognitive backing. This has led some researchers to propose that the development of throwing played a large part in the ballooning evolution of our hominin ancestors brains  more neurons, more brainpower, more food.

Throwing stones is one thing that remains uniquely human  and archerfish spit like we throw

Today, this evolutionary legacy permits spectacular feats of sporting ability, such as high-speed pitching in baseball, bowling in cricket, and three-pointers in basketball.

Its a defining feature. Accurate, powerful throwing remains a cornerstone of our species. Not many people consider this the highlight of human culture, says Schuster, but throwing stones is one thing that remains uniquely human.

Yet archerfish achieve similar feats with a liquid. Just as we can adjust the strength of our throws, they can finely tune their jets to hit targets of varying distance. It requires temporal precision of the archerfish in just the same way, says Schuster.It is analogous to the celebrated, uniquely human capability of directed and precise throwing of stones.

And archerfish blow our skills out of the water. A thrown stone will slow down as it approaches the target, a victim of gravity and air resistance. But an archerfishs super droplet does the opposite  it accelerates.

In order to achieve the same abilities as these fish, humans would have to throw many stones one after the other in quick succession, each one slightly faster than the one before, says Vailati, so that you have a giant super stone hitting the target.

Schuster thinks that the archerfishs unique hunting style may have catalysed greater intelligence in these fish  just as throwing is posited to have done for our ancestors. Any neurons that have evolved for spitting can be used for other tasks, from adjusting the archerfishs aim according to the refraction of light into water, to gauging where their prey will land on the waters surface so that the hunter can be confident of claims its prize first.

The neurons may even a role to play in social learning. Without firing one jet of water, captive archerfish can learn new tricks  such as hitting moving aerial prey  simply by watching others. By studying them you cannot escape seeing that they are really clever fish, Schuster says. Its uniquely fishy.",[]

bbc.com,,Geldof from rock star to tech entrepreneur,"['Sean Coughlan', 'Education Correspondent']","Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Bob Geldof says technology, for better or worse, is the battleground for ideas and the economy

Bob Geldof cuts an unlikely figure at the annual educational technology trade fair in London's Excel centre.

The cavernous Bett Show - British Educational Training and Technology - is a deafening marketplace of over-sized technology displays.

And in the middle of it is the Irish singer, with visitors surprised to see his craggy rock-and-roll features among the giant screens and gadget adverts.

But he's no techno kid. He brandishes what must be the world's oldest functioning mobile phone and says it does everything he needs, describing it as the ""AK47 of mobile telephony"".

""I'm in odd places in the world, where there's no power. This lasts five days. All I want it to do is get a signal.""

Geldof is here as co-founder of an educational technology firm called Groupcall. This provides a service for schools to send text messages to parents if pupils are late or missing or any other reason that schools might need to contact families.

No exams

Running a tech firm he says is ""like being in a band"", it starts off with something small and then grows. ""Intellectually, it's good fun.""

Image caption With David Bowie on stage at the Live Aid fundraising concert in 1985

He describes himself as an ""autodidact"", self-taught rather than the product of formal learning.

""I was never interested in academia, I never got any exams, I never went to college. But that isn't what interests me.""

He is a scattergun of eclectic ideas, punctuated by some really energetic swearing.

He talks about his passion for the poetry of WB Yeats and how much he would have liked to have met the radical women of early-20th Century revolutionary Ireland.

Image caption Bob Geldof at this year's Bett Show education technology trade fair

And he tells a story about how in 1978 the Boomtown Rats turned down $100,000 to play a company event in California, proposed by a young tech entrepreneur called Steve Jobs.

""It was a lot of money and they were being hip and cool.""

But he said the punk band told Apple: ""We don't do corporates."" With some more lively language added to the sentiment.

'Clash of ideas'

The practical side of technology might elude him, but he is fascinated by its far-reaching implications.

Image caption Steve Jobs in the late 1970s wanted to be ""hip and cool"" by hiring a punk band, says Geldof

Whether it is a ""clash of ideas"" with ""medieval fundamentalists"" or creative industries trying to ""re-invent the economy"", he says the internet is going to be the battleground.

""It seems to me that technology will mediate a lot of that.""

The accelerating development of artificial intelligence could change the future of humanity, he says, or else ""wipe ourselves out, which is not off the cards"".

He likens the internet to Gutenberg's invention of the printing press, saying he might have ""just been trying to make a buck"", but the technology set off a chain reaction, democratising knowledge and changing politics and society.

""It's where it's going that really excites me. I won't be around to see what happens, that's the only irritating thing about dying. I won't be around to see what happens next.""

'Silicon chip'

He says his interest in computers goes back to the 1970s.

""I remember Bill Gates saying everyone would have their own computer - that's why I wrote the 'silicon chip inside her head',"" in the lyric of the Rats' big hit, I Don't Like Mondays.

Image caption Development campaigner: Geldof speaking at the BBC's Africa 2015 conference

""I thought it was really interesting that memory - the thing that constructs self - was being put on a piece of sand.

""So William Blake had suddenly become real, when he wrote 'To see the universe in a grain of sand', and that was very romantic to me.""

His firm's technology helps schools and parents to keep track of children. And he says he is keenly aware of the balancing act between keeping people safe and an overbearing sense of constant monitoring.

Geldof says he can't stand the ""nonsense"" of behaving as though all strangers are predators and says he hates it that adults are afraid of helping a child lost in the supermarket.

But he says technology can help make sure that parents know when there is danger, like a pupil not arriving at school. And it can block inappropriate websites.

""If we can guarantee parents that their children are not going to be able to access sites of brutality and murder, of medieval death cultism, then I'm there.""

Geldof, peering through his shaggy hair like an esoteric springer spaniel, doesn't much resemble the other corporate tech sellers at the show.

He might be a businessman now, but he still has the sulphur of the heroic age of rock and roll, before pop stars became hedge fund kids with banjos.

The digital economy will bring ""bewildering"" changes, he says, creating its own ""backwash"" of disruption.

""Like all interesting times, it's dangerous too.""",[]

bbc.com,,'Yesterday I was killed but worse was the humiliation which came after',"['Bbc Trending', ""What's Popular""]","'Yesterday I was killed but worse was the humiliation which came after'

Image copyright Facebook Image caption Even though Maria Coni and Marina Menegazzo were murdered together, some questioned why they were ""travelling alone"".

A Facebook post written from the perspective of two murdered South American female backpackers has gone viral as part of a backlash against alleged victim blaming.

The post was written by Paraguayan student Guadalupe Acosta in response to some of the reaction to the killing of two young Argentine women in Ecuador. Following the murders, some people online appeared to question whether the backpackers had, by their actions, brought the crime upon themselves.

The post has been shared more than 700,000 times since it was posted on Facebook. In it, Acosta imagines events from the perspective of the victims, Maria Coni, 22, and Marina Menegazzo, 21.

""Yesterday I was killed ... but worse than death was the humiliation which came after,"" it begins.

According to the police account of the murders, the two Argentine tourists had run out of money in Ecuador when they met a pair of men who offered them a place to stay. But before the next morning, police say, Jose Maria Coni, 22, and Marina Menegazzo, 21, were dead - allegedly murdered by the men they thought were doing them a favour. The bodies were stuffed into plastic bags. Two men have reportedly confessed to the crime.

It might have been a brutal, but sadly all too common crime story. But the story fuelled a larger discussion in the days after the killings, after some of the people commenting online questioned why the women were ""travelling alone""

That phrase in Spanish - #viajosola - was soon trending on Twitter, with around 5,000 mentions in the past few weeks. Many pointed out that the women of course weren't travelling alone - they were together at the time - and defended not the victims but the idea of solo female travel.

""The first time I travelled alone was when I was 16, I've done so many times since, even after I got married. And I will not stop doing #viajosola,"" one woman commented. Another tweeted: ""I want to do travel alone without the fear I'll be punished for it.""

As reported by BBC Mundo (in Spanish), a prominent Argentine psychiatrist questioned why the women ""took a risk"". Although he later clarified he didn't mean to blame anyone but the alleged perpetrators for the murders, he was caught up in the backlash.

Acosta told BBC Trending she was moved to write her poem post reading online comments which seemed to blame the victims.

""These kinds of comments are often heard in Latin American countries when the murder of a woman happens.""

In her poem one of the victims rails against the ""useless questions"" that are asked of female victims. ""What clothes were you wearing? Why were you alone? Why would a woman travel without a companion? You went into a dangerous neighbourhood, what did you expect?""

Acosta said she was surprised by how widely her post, which ends with a feminist rallying cry, was shared.

""There are hundreds of laws under which (women) are treated as equals. But while that's the law, the real world is something else,"" she says. ""We must all start practicing more empathy, put ourselves in the heads of others and try to understand. Only this way will we achieve real change.""

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,"Pensei em me matar, diz mae que sofreu de depressao pos-parto","['Jefferson Puff - _jeffersonpuff', 'Da Bbc Brasil No Rio De Janeiro']","Image copyright Cris Ameln Image caption Dilssa Soares teve depressao pos-parto apos o nascimento do segundo filho; 'pensei em me matar', diz ao recontar experiencia

""Eu tinha vontade de me matar. Fiquei dois meses sem ir mais longe do que dois quarteiroes de casa. Eu achava que se fosse alem disso ia me jogar na frente de um carro. Era uma valvula de escape"".

E assim que a dona de casa Dilssa Liberio Soares, de 35 anos, relembra a pior etapa de um momento delicado enfrentado apos o nascimento de seu segundo filho.

Sem nunca ter sido diagnosticada oficialmente, 11 meses apos o nascimento de Max, ela agora tem certeza de ter enfrentado e sobrevivido a uma depressao pos-parto - e nao e um caso isolado.

Segundo uma pesquisa da Escola Nacional de Saude Publica, da Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), que entrevistou 23.896 mulheres entre 6 e 18 meses apos o parto, mais de uma em cada quatro brasileiras apresenta sintomas de depressao pos-parto.

O estudo ao qual a BBC Brasil teve acesso e que sera publicado no Journal of Affective Disorders analisou e detalhou fatores por tras dessa estatistica e foi liderado pela pesquisadora Mariza Theme.

Para ela, o trabalho representa um marco inedito nas pesquisas sobre o tema, ainda muito cercado por preconceitos e estereotipos no pais, inclusive por parte dos medicos, que muitas vezes negligenciam a questao ao tratar suas pacientes.

""E a primeira vez que temos um estudo no Brasil com tantas mulheres distribuidas por todos os Estados do pais, e os resultados mostram que o numero de maes que apresentam sintomas esta acima da media internacional"", explica.

'Acima da media' e politicas publicas

Segundo a Organizacao Mundial da Saude (OMS), a media de casos de depressao pos-parto em paises de baixa renda e de 19,8%. De acordo com o estudo da Fiocruz, no Brasil o indice de mulheres com sintomas e de 26,3%, indice maior do que o registrado tambem em paises da Europa, alem de EUA e Australia.

Para Mariza, a mensagem mais importante do estudo e a necessidade de que o governo monitore o problema no pre-natal e apos o parto.

""Sem ter essa questao incorporada de fato e de forma sistematica a rotina do SUS, essas mulheres nao sao identificadas, e portanto nao sao tratadas. Estao soltas por ai, sofrendo com um problema que pode ter reflexos no desenvolvimento da crianca e na saude das maes"", explica.

""Nosso trabalho vai ser lutar junto ao Ministerio da Saude para que as mulheres sejam testadas para depressao pos-parto e acompanhadas. Qualquer profissional da saude pode aplicar o questionario e fazer a triagem, nao e obrigatorio que seja um psicologo ou psiquiatra"".

Para o ginecologista e obstetra Alexandre Faisal, professor da Faculdade de Medicina da USP no Departamento de Medicina Preventiva e um dos maiores pesquisadores da area no Brasil, o pais ainda nao tem politicas publicas suficientes.

""Estudo depressao antes, durante e depois da gravidez ha mais de 15 anos no Brasil e acredito que nao temos politicas publicas adequadas. Esta e uma das lutas mais antigas de pesquisadores e medicos da area: a inclusao do rastreamento especifico para depressao pos-parto nas rotinas do SUS"", diz.

Na visao do especialista, e preciso incluir as perguntas que podem levar ao diagnostico e montar uma rede de tratamento.

""Como voce tem se sentido nos ultimos 15 dias? Deixou de ter prazer em alguma atividade que fazia naturalmente? Como esta seu sono, seu dia a dia? Voce tem se sentido infeliz, ansiosa ou preocupada sem uma boa razao? Tem se sentido infeliz a ponto de chorar?"", sao algumas das questoes que integram a Escala de Depressao Pos-Parto de Edimburgo, usada na pesquisa da Fiocruz.

""Assim como se mede a pressao e sao feitos exames, e preciso avaliar o emocional das gestantes. A segunda questao e estudar medidas para tratar o problema. Para onde vamos encaminhar essas mulheres?"", questiona Faisal, apontando para a necessidade de criacao de uma rede com psicologos e psiquiatras capacitados.

Questionado pela BBC Brasil, o Ministerio da Saude disse que ha atencao para o assunto e que oferece atendimento integral e gratuito as gestantes nos periodos pre-natal e pos-parto nas Unidades Basicas de Saude.

De acordo com a nota enviada, os profissionais que acompanham a mulher ""tem capacitacao e qualificacao para identificar, a qualquer momento, sinais de sofrimento mental e possiveis mudancas de comportamento para intervir da melhor forma possivel. Entre as estrategias adotadas esta uma entrevista com a mulher em sala reservada com questionario especifico que identifique depressao"".

O ministerio tambem cita a criacao da Rede Cegonha, em 2011, que prioriza o parto normal e visa proporcionar ""saude, qualidade de vida e bem-estar na gestacao, parto, pos-parto e o desenvolvimento da crianca ate os dois primeiros anos de vida"".

A nota nao deixou claro se existe ou nao a rotina especifica e sistematica recomendada pelos pesquisadores e especialistas, ja em uso no Reino Unido e na Australia e atualmente em discussao nos Estados Unidos, de acordo com recomendacoes da Academia de Ginecologia e Obstetricia americana.

Fatores, classe social e demandas das mulheres

O estudo da Fiocruz detalhou um perfil e uma serie de fatores que podem ajudar a explicar quem sao as mulheres mais propensas a desenvolver o problema.

Segundo Mariza Theme, a maioria das mulheres que sofre com depressao pos-parto no Brasil tem em media 25,6 anos (embora a faixa etaria das entrevistadas tenha variado de 12 a 54 anos), e da cor parda, de baixa condicao socioeconomica, com antecedentes de transtorno mental, habitos nao saudaveis e em geral ja tiveram mais filhos antes e nao planejaram a gravidez.

Do total de mulheres que apresentaram sintomas de depressao, 20,5% estavam na primeira gestacao, 30,6% na segunda, e 39,8% na terceira.

Um fator decisivo, segundo o estudo, e a classe social. ""A mulher com melhores condicoes socioeconomicas tambem enfrenta muitas dificuldades, mas quando diagnosticada com depressao pos-parto pode recorrer com mais facilidade ao tratamento psicologico. As mais pobres ja tem ambientes mais hostis e menos acesso a ajuda especializada"", diz Ana Lucia Keunecke, fundadora da ONG Artemis, de combate a violencia contra a mulher.

Ana diz que o assunto ainda e tabu entre as mulheres, que se sentem muito culpadas com a pressao social e muitas vezes sofrem sozinhas.

Um dos objetivos principais da organizacao e combater a violencia obstetrica, item tambem avaliado pela pesquisa da Fiocruz.

Mariza Theme diz que, embora seja fato conhecido que o Brasil conte com inumeros casos de partos violentos, incluindo manobras desnecessarias e uso de medicamentos para acelerar as contracoes, que causam dor a gestante, o estudo nao identificou uma relacao entre esses episodios e a depressao pos-parto.

""O resultado nos leva a algumas hipoteses, entre elas o fato de haver uma aceitacao como normal do modelo atual de atencao ao parto ainda realizado no pais"", diz.

A BBC Brasil conversou com tres maes que tiveram depressao pos-parto. As tres consideram que nao receberam atencao adequada, seja da rede publica ou privada de saude, e se viram alvo de comentarios e pressoes que estimularam um sentimento de culpa por estarem deprimidas.

""Todos tem um palpite. Se voce cuida de voce, do trabalho e da casa, esta deixando bebe em segundo plano. Se foca inteiramente na crianca, esta relaxando com as outras areas, ficando descuidada. Ha sempre um comentario, seja de amigos, parentes, visitas. Mas ninguem para e pergunta como voce esta, como esta se sentindo, se precisa de algo. A mulher se torna invisivel"", diz a fotografa Ly Pucca, que passou por tres episodios de depressao pos-parto.

Ela conta que, ao relatar alguns dos sintomas ao ginecologista, particular, ouviu: ""deixa de frescura"".

Depoimento de Dilssa Liberio Soares

""Na primeira gestacao tudo correu bem. Foi muito tranquilo, da gravidez ao parto. Eu trabalhei ate 20 dias antes de ela nascer, e minha filha Camila tem hoje oito anos.

Ja minha segunda gravidez foi muito tumultuada. Os medicos me alertaram ja no comeco que eu estava com diabetes e que seria uma gravidez de risco, e isso me deixou preocupada. Fiquei com isso na cabeca, ja me sentindo culpada.

Tentei fazer tudo certo a gestacao inteira. Acabei sendo internada por conta da pressao muito alta, e ele nasceu quando eu estava no hospital, prematuro, com 32 semanas. O parto foi muito traumatico, me deixaram sozinha numa sala, sem ninguem. Foi muito angustiante. Ele ficou na UTI neonatal por um mes.

Quando ele veio para casa muitas vezes ficavamos os dois chorando, eu com ele no colo. Eu me sentia na obrigacao de fazer tudo. Dar banho, trocar fraldas, dar de mamar - mas eu nao tinha vontade. Minha filha comecou a ter problemas na escola, e ela sempre tinha sido muito calminha.

Na verdade eu nunca quis ter filhos, mas veio a Camila quando eu tinha 27 anos e depois de oito anos apareceu o Max. Estou buscando fazer laqueadura no SUS.

O pior que senti foi uma vontade louca com relacao ao suicidio. Nao conseguia respirar, tinha palpitacoes, suor frio. Um dia fui ao supermercado e estava muito cheio, entrei em panico. Por dois meses nao fui mais longe do que dois quarteiroes, quase nao saia de casa. Eu achava que se fosse alem disso ia me jogar na frente de um carro. Era uma valvula de escape.

A minha patroa pediu para eu consultar um psicologo. Quando fui marcar, era final de novembro e nao tinha mais medico, ficou para janeiro. No comeco do ano, quando chegou a consulta, os sintomas ja tinham melhorado.

Se pudesse voltar atras, teria procurado ajuda profissional logo no comeco. Nunca fui oficialmente diagnosticada com depressao pos-parto, mas hoje sei que foi isso que tive.

Na minha opiniao, a mulher tem que tentar identificar e procurar um psicologo, um psiquiatra. Eu sou muito religiosa, e acredito que nao fiz nada de ruim para mim ou meu filho porque pagaria por isso de acordo com minhas crencas, mas nem todo mundo tem essa estrutura"".

Depoimento de Ly Pucca

Image copyright Cris Ameln Image caption A fotografa e doula Ly Pucca teve depressao pos-parto tres vezes; para ela a invisibilidade da mulher e o pior aspecto do problema

""Tive depressao nas tres gestacoes. A primeira foi uma gravidez nao planejada e muito complicada. Para a familia do meu ex-marido foi uma gestacao indesejada. Fui obrigada a casar, foi uma das coisas mais traumaticas da minha vida.

Fui forcada a ter cesarea, em hospital particular. Era final de ano, e todos diziam que minha insistencia por parto normal estragaria o Natal de todo mundo. Sempre quis ter parto normal.

Quando a Luiza nasceu, eu olhava para ela e nao conseguia respirar. Eu achava que seria incapaz de cuidar daquele ser tao fragil. Passei um mes e meio chorando direto e, quando cheguei, em casa entreguei o bebe nas maos da minha avo, que foi a unica pessoa que me apoiou.

Eu nao conseguia sair de casa e achava que ia morrer a qualquer momento. Quando a Luiza fez oito meses meu pai morreu, e ai tive sintomas de panico mesmo, insonia, taquicardia. Depois de dois anos comecei a trabalhar, e so ai vi que estava melhor.

Ao longo do tempo tive duas pessimas experiencias com medicos. Uma ginecologista me disse ah, nao gostou do nenem? e outro me disse que era para eu parar de frescura. Isso faz com que voce se sinta ainda mais culpada. Se um medico te diz isso, como voce se sente depois?

Uma vez procurei uma psicologa e ela dormiu no meio da sessao. Outra vez fui a um psiquiatra e ele me receitou um remedio, mas eu nao quis tomar.

Na segunda tambem tive depressao, mas foi bem mais leve. Na verdade eu so descobri que foi isso que eu tive faz tres anos.

Apesar do apoio do meu segundo marido e da minha mae, sentia uma solidao absurda, nao queria sair de casa, achava que iam roubar meu filho.

Ja na terceira gestacao eu houve varios problemas graves de saude e tanto eu quanto minha filha quase morremos. Isso contribuiu muito. Eu me sentia muito culpada.

Eu atribuo as minhas tres depressoes a uma falta de conhecimento da minha parte, a questao hormonal, as pressoes sociais pela maternidade perfeita, e a falta de ajuda profissional adequada. Hoje em dia gostaria muito de fazer terapia mas nao tenho condicoes financeiras, e nao vejo na rede publica.

So melhorei mesmo quando descobri, nas redes sociais, que muitas outras maes passavam pelo mesmo problema. Hoje so tenho vontade de ajudar, de perguntar do que elas estao precisando, pegar na mao e dizer eu ja passei por isso, voce vai conseguir; todo mundo passar pela mesma coisa, voce nao precisa ser a mae perfeita. A pior sensacao e a invisibilidade.

Ly mora em Sao Paulo, tem 39 anos, e mae de Luiza (16 anos), Pedro (7 anos) e Amanda (4 anos), e alem de fotografa e doula, ativista e faz sessoes de fotografia com mulheres como forma de empoderamento e recuperacao da autoestima apos a maternidade

Depoimento de Ana Lucia Keunecke

Image copyright Cris Ameln Image caption Para advogada Ana Lucia Keunecke, criacao de ONG ajudou no processo de recuperacao da depressao pos-parto

""Eu era advogada e tinha meu proprio escritorio, trabalhando como autonoma, sem direito a licenca maternidade. Era uma pressao. Na gravidez da minha filha correu tudo bem. Levava a Sofia comigo para audiencias, ela ficava comigo o tempo todo. Ela nasceu em casa, e foi tudo muito tranquilo.

Com meu filho, quatro anos depois, foi bem diferente. Eu sentia muita raiva de tudo que me tirasse dele. Fui parando de comer, de tomar banho, de fazer as coisas. Eu chorava sem parar. So entrava no chuveiro se ele estivesse me olhando, e eu pudesse ve-lo o tempo todo.

Minha parteira percebeu, duas semanas depois do nascimento dele, que eu poderia estar com depressao. Ao final do primeiro mes, eu tinha perdido 14 quilos, estava de cama e sendo medicada. Nao conseguia mais andar, e foi ai que minha familia percebeu e comecou a me ajudar.

A depressao grave persistiu por seis a sete meses, mas a recuperacao completa levou tres anos. Foi quando eu pude parar de trabalhar por um ano e me dedicar a minha saude e aos meus filhos.

Tive ajuda do meu marido e de uma pessoa para me auxiliar com as coisas da casa. Tenho certeza de que e muito mais dificil para as mulheres que nao tem condicoes financeiras. Sei que sou privilegiada.

Tudo isso me fez mudar de vida, e vi que melhorei muito quando abracei a Artemis, como diretora juridica, podendo ajudar outras mulheres ao batalhar por uma maternidade voluntaria, prazerosa e socialmente protegida.

Defendemos que a mulher precisa ser protegida, amparada, precisa ter creches a disposicao, educacao, saude, e que a maternidade tem que ser voluntaria, ou seja, a mulher tem que poder escolher se quer ou nao ser mae.

Olhando para tras vejo que quando a gente se torna mae e como se morresse uma mulher para nascer outra, e que nao somos preparadas para este momento. E uma solidao, uma exclusao social, uma pressao de todo mundo, e isso reforca minha conviccao de que precisamos lutar pela maternidade amparada e protegida socialmente"".",[]

""I studied peace studies for two years, looking specifically at innovation and technology, so how you can leverage the power of technology in order to create better collaboration between people, and ultimately come up with solutions that can be implemented to create a better society.

""I think peace is such a fluffy term to many people. And my question during my studies was, how do you make peace tangible?

""So if you could quantify peace by using technology, I thought that would be really interesting, and very helpful to come up, essentially, with the argument and the right data, that peace is more profitable than war.

""If we could show, in a very, very concrete financial way in financial terms, how peace is profitable, I hope that would lead to a much better society.""

""I escaped a forced marriage in Pakistan, and one of the biggest reasons was because I was economically empowered. That's what I'm advocating for.

""It's very important for women, especially those who come from disadvantaged backgrounds, that they are economically empowered. And I think technology provides tremendous opportunities to be able to do that for women.

""It's just impossible to stay away from technology, because it's become such an integral part of our life now, and the fact that we are lagging behind and there are less women who are comfortable with technology, or less women in the technology field and into coding, that's really taking a toll on the whole of humanity.""

What is International Women's Day?

International Women's Day has been held on 8 March every year since 1913, and has been recognised by the United Nations since 1975.

The UN says it's a time to reflect on progress made, to call for change and to celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities.

The theme of this year's day is ""Planet 50-50 by 2030"" - aiming to achieve global equality in areas such as education and end all forms of discrimination.

""I wasn't interested in web stuff, or computer stuff.

""The reason I chose graphic design is that when I was young we used to watch cartoons like Power Rangers. And I was like, one day, I want to make my own animation. That's what I told my siblings. That's why I want to do graphic design, to make my dream come true.""

""Computing, as an industry, is such a young field, that we're still building this body of work to explain and communicate it to the rest of the world. I think the very thing that I want to show is how coding can be as creative a tool as music or drawing or words.

""You create something out of nothing, with pure words and thought structures. Learning programming teaches you to look at the world in a different way.

""Our kids are going to live in a world where everything around them is a computer. One skill to navigate that world is definitely coding, but it's also about developing the imagination, attitudes and approach towards technology.""

""I was 10 years old when the computer arrived at my home, and basically that day, I started using the internet for hours at a time. This was in the 1990s, when parents didn't really care if you were spending too much time online, because they didn't understand what it was.

""And so I had, unmonitored, unrestricted access to the internet, maybe just filtered by how dial-up connections were at the time. And I just saw how my life truly changed because of that, because of the content I was exposed to, the friendships I made, how I learned about things that I would have never learned about otherwise.

""My aim is to give people working with youth the tools to use technology as a pretext to have more important conversations. So for example, sexual and reproductive rights organisations that teach people how to use condoms.

""Let's have a workshop where kids find out how a Wiki article is produced, and why the Wiki article on Aids might be totally difficult to understand for them, and understand how it came to be.

""Or how to assess results when you Google if you're pregnant or not, and how to take things with a grain of salt. Like you always tell people that they should be critical of information, so I want to give adults who work with youth special and concrete ways to give youth the tools to do that.""

""My main advice would be to blaze your own trail.

""Don't assume that the only options available to you are kind of the ones that get pitched in the career fair brochure.

""That the main thing is to focus on what you like to do, what you're interested in, what makes you tick, and think about how your skill set can come together with those interests.

""And the technology industry is so dynamic that there are so many opportunities for anyone to blaze their own trail, that people should always think that's a possibility for them.""

""My students will not have to travel that far, and can do whatever they'd like to do. At that moment I thought, 'The world's going to change.'""

""When I was doing my first job I realised I was the only woman in the organisation at this time. So at one point, I kind of wished myself to find a girl that we could intern, just to make sure that I could see more girls in the workplace.

""And as I was thinking, 'Where are these girls, and why are they not joining this career?', I realised that it's about lack of information when making their career choices.

""So I just thought that maybe we could start to do some workshops to get awareness to the high school girls, that if you study computer science that is still a good point, and that will probably build you up well.

""I always tell girls, 'Even if you get into design, get into medicine, get into whatever it is, you're going to need some well-detailed computer skills. Whatever you want to be, you want to be a doctor, you want to be a lawyer, you'll need technology.'""

Four Sport Relief volunteers agree to sleep rough on the streets of London to experience the harsh reality of homelessness in the UK. Comedian Nick Hancock, TV presenter Julia Bradbury, former snooker player Willie Thorne and celebrity cleaner Kim Woodburn all struggle with isolation, fear, the cold and wet and the effort of day-to-day survival.

For each volunteer, the streets become a test of strength and self-reliance, and not everybody copes. They start to examine their own lives and their own relationships with homelessness: Willie has gambled hundreds of thousands of pounds away during a 40-year gambling addiction and has just gone bankrupt, while Kim survived being homeless herself as a teenager and has strong opinions on how deserving of help or not the homeless are in the UK.

This social experiment, led by The Big Issue founder John Bird, aims to expose the realities of an increasing homeless problem in the UK. The number of rough sleepers has gone up 55% and the average age of death is just 47 years old - 43 if you're a woman.

Maria Jose Coni, de 22 anos, y Marina Menegazzo, de 21, tenian el sueno de salir de su Mendoza natal a conocer Sudamerica con sus mochilas.

Pero ese sueno se vio truncado hace unos dias en el balneario de Montanita, en Ecuador, donde fueron asesinadas.

La muerte de las dos turistas argentinas ha causado conmocion en su pais y en toda America Latina.

Los familiares de las victimas tienen dudas sobre la version de los hechos ofrecida por las autoridades ecuatorianas y unos peritos argentinos han llegado a Ecuador para investigar el crimen.

El asesinato de las jovenes ha desatado un amplio debate sobre el acoso que sufren las mujeres y sobre si estas deben viajar ""solas"".

En las redes se sociales se difundio ampliamente una carta escrita por la paraguaya Guadalupe Acosta en primera persona, que asume la voz de las turistas y que empieza diciendo ""Ayer me mataron"".

""Me negue a que me tocaran y con un palo me reventaron el craneo. Me metieron una cuchillada y dejaron que muera desangrada"", continua.

Image copyright Ministro del Interior de Ecuador Image caption Las autoridades ecuatorianas han detenido a Segundo P. y Eduardo D. como sospechosos del crimen.

Preguntas inutiles

La misiva escrita por esta estudiante de Comunicacion cuestiona que algunos hayan responsabilizado a las jovenes argentinas de su muerte, sembrando dudas sobre las circunstancias de su asesinato y cuestionando que viajaran solas.

""Nadie se pregunto donde estaba el hijo de puta que acabo con mis suenos, mis esperanzas, mi vida. No, mas bien empezaron a hacerme preguntas inutiles. Que ropa tenias? Por que andabas sola? Como una mujer va a viajar sin compania? Te metiste en un barrio peligroso, Que esperabas?"", dice la carta. ""Les dijeron [a mis padres] que seguro que algo hicimos"".

Han sido varias las periodistas latinoamericanas las que tambien han expresado su malestar por algunos comentarios que se han hecho sobre la muerte de las turistas.

Es el caso de la columnista del periodico colombiano El Espectador, Catalina Ruiz Navarro, quien critico la actitud de algunos medios con respecto a la tragedia.

""Preguntaron [...] que si estaban de fiesta en Montanita (ese vortex de perdicion para los jovenes), que si les gustaba mucho bailar. Sin duda, ellas provocaron su asesinato. Aun peor; querer conocer el mundo fue una provocacion para el asesinato"", escribio Ruiz en un reciente articulo.

#Viajosola

En los ultimos dias en Twitter se ha popularizado el hashtag #viajosola entre las cuentas de usuarias de la red social que defienden su derecho y costumbre de viajar solas.

Estas tambien han cuestionado las afirmaciones que sostienen que las turistas argentinas iban ""solas"", pese a que eran dos, asegurando que no se hubiera enfatizado lo mismo si hubieran sido hombres.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Rafael Correa, el presidente de Ecuador, ha aceptado que Argentina envie a sus propios peritos a investigar el crimen.

En este sentido, la carta viral de Guadalupe Acosta critica la desigualdad de genero.

""Solo muerta entendi que para el mundo [...] morir fue mi culpa. Al ser mujer, se minimiza [el crimen]. Porque claro, yo me lo busque. Haciendo lo que yo queria encontre mi merecido por no ser sumisa"".

Catalina Ruiz Navarro tambien muestra indignacion en su columna de El Espectador ante las limitaciones que sufren las mujeres por esta desigualdad, no solo cuando viajan, sino en su vida diaria:

""Pensemos en todas las cosas que las mujeres no podemos hacer, en todos los lugares a donde no podemos ir, les parece que eso es igualdad? La violencia de genero, el acoso sexual, los feminicidios y las violaciones construyen barreras imaginarias, delimitan esos lugares a donde las mujeres 'no podemos ir'"", afirma.

La autora lamenta que ""por seguridad, las mujeres terminan confinadas a los espacios privados, en donde, para mayor horror, tambien son blanco frecuente de violencia domestica"".

El articulo concluye que ""no hay tal cosa como un lugar 'seguro' en donde las mujeres podamos estar o, al menos, no cuando el machismo y la misoginia habitan todos los espacios"".

Victimas propiciatorias?

Una de las opiniones mas criticadas sobre la muerte de Maria Jose y Marina fue la del psiquiatra argentino Hugo Marietan, que califico a las dos chicas como ""victimas propiciatorias"", segun la pagina web BigBang.

Marietan las define como mujeres que asumen ""un alto riesgo y de alguna manera forma parte de lo que moviliza el crimen, sin quitarle el peso de la responsabilidad de los agresores"".

La periodista Silvina Heguy le respondio en un articulo titulado ""#viajosola: todo lo que no podran ser"", publicado en la pagina web Anfibia.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Montanita se ubica a unos 180 kilometros de Guayaquil, Ecuador.

""Todavia no podemos borrar la idea de que las que viajan solas no juegan con fuego. Que porque viajemos sin compania -es decir sin un hombre que ""nos proteja""- debemos asumir la condicion de ser un blanco movil para cualquiera que crea que puede hacer con las mujeres lo que se le ocurra"", escribe.

La presidenta del Consejo Nacional de las Mujeres de Argentina, Fabiana Tunez, tambien rechazo las palabras del psiquiatra Marietan: ""Siento terrible dolor de que un psiquiatra no entienda lo que significa ser mujer en una sociedad machista"".

Tunez dijo al portal BigBang News que ""las victimas nunca son responsables de nada, porque estamos hablando de violencia de genero"".

En su defensa, el psiquiatra Marietan dijo que rechazaba ""firmemente"" que piensen que el culpabiliza a las victimas del asesinato.

""Como voy a culpar a estas pobres chicas"", dijo segun BigBang. ""Por supuesto que repudio a los asesinos. La intencion es prevenir crimenes y que las mujeres tengan el debido cuidado antes de arriesgarse a situaciones que las coloquen en una situacion de dificil defensa. Yo me enfoco en la prevencion"".

El tema de las turistas argentinas suscito diversos comentarios en Twitter. La usuaria Tania Tagle (@Tania_Tagle) dijo:

""La primera vez que viaje sola tenia 16, lo he hecho muchas veces desde entonces, aun casada. Y no pienso dejar de hacerlo #viajosola"".

Lola Pastor Rivera (@LolapastorRive) escribio ""Yo tambien #viajosola y quiero poder hacerlo sin miedo y sin que me criminalicen por ello"".

Satu studi di Kanada menggunakan relawan untuk menghirup udara kotor yang ditemukan di banyak kota besar, untuk melihat yang dilakukan racun itu terhadap gen kita.

Selama dua jam menghirup asap solar di ruang bawah tanah di sebuah rumah sakit bukanlah hal yang menyenangkan di pagi hari.

Tapi itulah yang dilakukan Julia, subyek COPA-03, di dalam ruang kedap suara berukuran 1,2 x 1,8 meter dengan tinggi 2,1 meter sambil menonton Netflix di iPad.

Sesekali dia menggunakan sepeda latih untuk mengatur pernafasannya. Jumlah asap solar yang dihirupnya kira-kira setara dengan tingkat polusi udara di Mexico City atau Beijing.

Tugasnya bukan untuk mempromosikan pariwisata di kota-kota yang berpolusi itu.

Namun di dalam ruang kedap suara itu, dia sedang membantu untuk lebih mengetahui dampak dari polusi udara, memberi petunjuk akan kebutuhan berkesinambungan dalam membersihkan udara yang kita hirup, dan memusatkan perhatian pada kesulitan bernafas di kalangan orang yang paling menderita.

Polusi udara belakangan ini menjadi keprihatinan besar: akhir tahun 2014 industri mobil Jerman, Volkswagen, dilanda skandal besar setelah terungkap mereka memasang perangkat penipu di dalam mobilnya untuk bisa tampak 'lebih bersih' ketika sedang melakukan uji emisi.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Penyakit Gangguan Paru Kronis merupakan penyebab ketiga dalam kematian dini di seluruh dunia.

Pada tahun 2030, Badan Organisasi Dunia, WHO, memperkirakan Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, COPD, atau Penyakit Gangguan Paru Kronis merupakan penyebab ketiga dalam kematian dini di seluruh dunia.

Kondisinya biasanya dikaitkan dengan merokok (namun tidak selalu) dan penelitian menunjukkan bahwa dalam kasus bukan perokok, polusi udara termasuk asap diesel mungkin jadi penyebabnya.

Bagian 'melekat' di negara berkembang

Tidak ada alternatif selain membersihkan udara. Dr David Diaz-Sanchez

Di London saja, kualitas udara yang buruk diperkirakan membunuh sekitar 10.000 orang tiap tahunnya, walau dalam masa yang ekstrem seperti insiden yang disebut Asap Besar tahun 1952, tingkat kematian biasanya jauh lebih tinggi.

Asap solar merupakan polutan yang selalu ada di negara-negara berkembang, kata Dr Jeremy Hirota dari Universitas British Columbia, Kanada. Di negara-negara itu, adalah hal biasa melihat asap hitam ke luar dari truk. Jelaga hitam itu adalah partikel solar.

Kita kembali ke Julia, yang menghirup asap lewat pipa dari generator mesin solar yang mendesing di luar Rumah Sakit Umum Vancouver.

Asap disalurkan ke dalam ruang tempat dia berada dan diencerkan dengan udara bersih yang disaring. Setelah dua jam menghisap secara terkendali, Julia dibawa dengan taksi ke rumah sakit St Paul, tempat dia sesekali secara teratur menggunakan sepeda latih.

Di sana, dalam ruangan yang lebih kecil lagi seukuran kotak telepon umum dengan dinding kaca- seorang teknisi memandu Julia untuk menarik dan mengeluarkan nafas dengan kuat ke dalam sebuah tabung.

Fungsi paru-parunya digambarkan dalam serangkaian grafik dan Julia diperiksa untuk perubahan darah, air seni, dan fungsi paru-parunya.

Ini bukan pekerjaan untuk relawan yang pengecut. Kemudian, seorang ahli pernafasan, Dr Chris Carlsten, menaruh tabung di tenggorokan Julia yang sudah dibius, menyemprotkan garam ke paru-parunya dan menyedot bagian dari selaput paru-paru yang terlepas dengan menggunakan sikat.

Image copyright iStock Image caption Asap dari mesin berbahan bakar solar merupakan polutan yang selalu ada di negara-negara berkembang.

Eksperimen ini amat bernilai. Dengan membuat setiap relawan terpapar pada campuran yang diatur dari udara bersih atau udara yang terpolusi oleh solar secara acak, maka relawan tidak tahu udara yang dia hirup kotor atau bersih.

Dengan demikian maka Carlsten dan Hirota dua guru besar kedokteran di Pusat Penyakit Gangguan Paru Kronis Universitas British Columbia- bisa mengkaji bagaimana partikel polusi mempengaruhi kita.

Penelitian Carlsten sebelumnya menunjukkan bahwa walau hanya dua jam terpapar polusi udara bisa mempengaruhi gen kita. Pengaruhnya bukan perubahan atas rangkaian DNA semacam menu; yang membuat inidvidu unik- namun polusi udara tampaknya menambah unsur kimia ke rangkaian DNA.

Dampak yang bisa dibalikkan?

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Riset tentang dampak polusi udara semakin meningkat belakangan ini.

Perubahan gen itu dikenal sebagai perubahan epigenetika, jelas Dr David Diaz-Sanchez, pimpinan riset di Labolatorium Riset Pengaruh Lingkungan dan Kesehatan Nasional, Badan Perlindungan Lingkungan Amerika Serikat.

Seperti yang dijelaskan Diaz-Sanchez, factor lingkungan seperti polusi, diet, dan stress bisa membuat gen kita hidup atau mati, atau mempengaruhi bagaimana sel terlihat dalam gen. Sampai beberapa waktu lalu, hanya sedikit bukti-bukti tentang pengaruh polusi atas gen. Namun hal itu mulai berubah.

Apakah perubahan epigenetika yang disebabkan polusi udara bisa dibalikkan? Mungkin saja karena perubahan epigenetika yang terkait dengan polusi udara diduga tidak bersifat jangka panjang namun waktu dan lebih banyak penelitian- yang kelak akan menjawabnya.

Apakah perubahan itu bisa dibalikkan atau tidak, kita tahu bahwa tubuh kita bereaksi atas polusi udara yang dihirup dalam berbagai cara, seperti dijelaskan Dr Neil Alexis, Departemen Anak Pediatrik dan Pengobatan Lindkungan, Asma, dan Biologi Paru-paru di Universitas North Carolina.

Salah satu cara paru-paru bereaksi dengan peradangan, yang merupakan tanggapan positif tubuh atas sebuah serangan.

Image copyright Image caption Diperkirakan sedikitnya 15% dari kasus COPD di seluruh dunia terkait dengan polusi udara.

Bagaimanapun jadinya seperti cerita lama, Terlalu banyak hal yang baik bisa menjadi buruk, sehingga peradangan harus didiamkan atau diatasi, jelasnya.

Dan mendiamkan atau mengatasi itu merupakan salah satu tugas dari sistem pertahanan tubuh. Selama terpapar udara kotor, fungsi paru-paru juga terpengaruh sehingga menghambat kemampuan kita untuk bernafas.

Orang yang menderita penyakit terkait pernafasan, seperti COPD atau asma, memiliki sistem pertahanan tubuh yang sudah berubah, dengan hasil akhirnya bisa 'di bawah pencapaian atau di atas pencapaian'. Dalam konteks polusi udara, kata Alexis, kedua skenario itu agaknya tidak baik.

Carlsten memperkirakan sedikitnya 15% dari kasus COPD di seluruh dunia terkait dengan polusi udara. Dan dibandingan dengan asma, maka COPD memiliki beban sosial dan ekonomi yang lebih besar.

Asma merupakan gangguan arus pernafasan yang bisa dipulihkan cepat dengan obat, namun COPD seperti jaring laba-laba dari selaput paru-paru dengan gangguan hubungan yang tidak bisa dipulihkan.

Masih ada kerangka kerja untuk jarring laba-laba itu, namun ada lubang besar yang tidak bisa lagi menukar gas, dan Anda tidak bisa mendapatkan udara, jelas Hirota.

Jika Anda melihat penelitian tentang polusi udara, umumnya merupakan epidemiologi dan sains yang mendasar. Jadi pilar ketiga, kata Carlsten, adalah eksperimen paparan manusia yang dikendalikan.

Biasanya, ketika kebijakan diputuskan terkait polusi udara, paparan manusia yang dikendalilan selalu mennadi keping yang amat pending dalam sebuah teka-teki, tuturnya.

Tentu saja, seperti dijelaskan Diaz-Sanchez, cara yang paling efektif untuk menghindari dampak kesehatan meluas dari polusi udara adalah mencegah untuk memproduksinya.

Tidak ada alternatif selain membersihkan udara, tegasnya. Namun dalam banyak situasi, hal itu semakin sulit dicapai. Jadi dengan mengidentifikasi orang-orang yang paling berisiko dari polusi udara, maka terbuka pula kemungkinan untuk terapi yang dikembangkan guna menangani mereka yang paling mudah terkena.

Ini area yang berkembang, kata Diaz-Sanchez. Bahkan lima tahun lalu, amat sedikit riset dalam bidang ini namun semakin meningkat sejalan dengan waktu.

Itulah sebabnya kenapa pernafasan Julia di ruang kecil itu akan menambah data yang sudah diterima dari belasan sukarelawan sebelum dan sesudahnya, bisa memberikan prakarsa baru untuk membersihkan udara

bbc.com,2016-02-19 00:00:00,A famous island nobody knows,['Diane Selkirk'],"From the sea  when all we could see of Anjouan were its green peaks and the indistinct structures of the city of Mutsamudu  we could smell the cloves. It smells like Christmas, my daughter Maia said.

Did you know? During a controversial Chinese research program that ran from 2007 to 2013, the entire Comoros population of 700,000 people was given three doses of Artequick, a malaria drug derived from an ancient Chinese drug called Artemisinin, which recently earned its researcher, Youyou Tu, a Nobel Prize in Medicine.



By 2014  with no new cases of malaria being reported  Doctor Li Guoqiao, the scientist behind the Comoros project, said malaria has been eliminated.

Located off the east coast of Africa, between Mozambique and Madagascar, Anjouan is one of the three main islands that make up the country of Comoros (the others are Grande Comoros and Moheli). A former French colony, Comoros is perfect for tourism  with picture-postcard beaches, dramatic volcanic peaks and an abundant marine park. But in the three decades following the countrys 1975 split from France, it suffered through some 20 coups and secession attempts, rendering it inhospitable and virtually unknown to travellers.

A friend on our around-the-world sailing voyage had suggested we visit after reading a few scant details about the archipelagos rich agriculture, historical cities and unique solution to its political strife (the presidency now rotates through the three islands). So we sailed there, almost on a whim, making landfall in a country wed only just heard of.

Despite knowing nothing about Anjouan, there was something about it that felt familiar. How is it I had no idea what a clove tree looked like? I asked my husband and daughter an hour into an all-day tour. I was looking at a medium-sized tree thats only special feature was aromatic clusters of ripening cloves. Our guide, Maketse, pointed high in the neighbouring trees where we spotted boys picking the clusters. Next, they would separate the cloves by hand and dry them by spreading them on roadside tarps in the hot sun. Over the course of a few days, the spice would shift from bright green and brilliant red to the brown of the cloves in my kitchen. Eventually, as the countrys largest export, these cloves would end up in grocery stores around the world.

Following Maketse, we continued down a winding trail into a fragrant forest. There, women draped in bright fabrics, their faces painted with sandalwood paste to protect them from the sun, were picking delicate yellow ylang-ylang flowers  the base of Chanel No 5, the perfume that Marilyn Monroe made famous. Holding a few blossoms in my hands, I inhaled deeply. The scent  jasmine, pear and maybe carnation and clove  evoked something on the edge of my memory. Maybe it was a party or a wedding from my childhood, my mother and aunt in bright satin dresses with their hair piled high and wearing that perfume.

It takes 18 hours to turn 100kg of these ylang-ylang flowers into three litres of essential oil. Standing in front of one of the islands 350 wood-fired distilleries  which are kept busy year round supplying around 80% of the worlds ylang-ylang  I watched, captivated, as the flowers were heaped into a crude cauldron and transformed, drop by drop, into pale amber essence.

We werent the first sailors to be intrigued by Comoros. Before the Suez Canal was built, it was a favoured provisioning stop for ships trading between Africa, Asia, India and Arabic countries. By the 15th Century, the country was firmly Islamic  but then came the English, Portuguese and Dutch. However, it was the French who saw the islands true potential: eager to break the Dutch hold on the spice trade, French botany thief Pierre Poivre stole nutmeg, clove, pepper and cinnamon plants from the Banda Islands and smuggled them for cultivation in Comoros (as well as Reunion and the Seychelles). These crops were soon joined by vanilla vines from Mexico and ylang-ylang plants from Indonesia.

Under French rule, plantations in what came to be known as the Perfume Isles briefly prospered. French chemists Garnier and Rechler discovered that not only was ylang-ylang, in the form of scented hair oil, popular with Victorians, but it also had medicinal properties. Meanwhile vanilla, which came late to the spice world, became a household staple along with nutmeg, clove, pepper and cinnamon.

Political instability and a volatile spice trade have taken their toll on Comoros, and now its one of the poorest countries in the world. When Maketse led us past a busy mosque and into the arms-width alleyways of Mutsamudus ancient medina, it felt like we were walking somewhere that was not just lost in time, but forgotten. One person after the next would stop us to shake our hands and ask us where were from and what news wed brought from the outside world.

A man operating a hand cranked sewing machine on an ornate, but ramshackle, table wanted to know what we thought about the last election in the UK. Another man, who was selling his world famous bourbon vanilla beans from a shabby storefront, asked questions about Canada. But it was the brother of a woman selling sandalwood paste sunscreen that stumped me. What do people know about Comoros? he asked.

I thought of the little ways these islands had touched my life without my knowing: the perfumes that waft by at parties, the vanilla that flavours my ice cream and the cloves that spice my Christmas cookies. Comoros is almost famous, I told him.

Back on our boat, I emptied my daughters pockets of crushed ylang-ylang flowers, a cluster of red and green cloves, an unripe vanilla bean and some crumbles of cinnamon bark. I was going to throw it all away when Maia started to gather them up to save. Smell it, she said of her little bundle of mingled scents. Its Comoros.

Warga Padang, Sumatra Barat, menuju ke kawasan yang tinggi karena sempat dikeluarkan peringatan tsunami akibat gempa Rabu (02/03) malam.

Pusat gempa pada pukul 19.49 WIB terletak di lepas pantai sejauh 682 kilometer di sebelah barat daya Kepulauan Mentawai, dengan kedalaman 10 kilometer.

Warga sempat panik karena getaran namun dilaporkan tidak ada korban jiwa maupun kerusakan besar.

Beberapa langsung menuju ke kawasan yang lebih tinggi di Padang setelah adanya peringatan tsunami.

Namun beberapa waktu kemudian peringatan tsunami dicabut.

Gempa juga dilaporkan terasa di Payakumbuh, sekitar 120 km dari Padang, kota terbesar yang paling dekat dengan pusat gempa.

El uso de psicofarmacos para tratar la depresion ha experimentado un ""preocupante aumento"" en los ultimos anos, segun la Organizacion Mundial de la Salud (OMS).

Un aviso de la Asociacion Americana de Psiquiatria (APA, por sus siglas en ingles) en el ano 2004 habia logrado disminuir el uso de este tipo de medicamentos, por sus vinculaciones a posibles comportamientos suicidas.

Pero un nuevo estudio de la OMS publicado en la Revista Europea de Neuropsicofarmacologia reflejo que, entre 2005 y 2012, la costumbre de recetar antidepresivos en ninos se incremento a niveles alarmantes.

La investigacion mostro que, durante esos siete anos, hubo un aumento del 54% en el Reino Unido, un 26% en Estados Unidos, un 60% en Dinamarca, un 49% en Alemania y un 17% en los Paises Bajos.

Pero el fenomeno ocurre en todo el mundo.

Desconocimiento

La depresion en la ninez se empezo a reconocer hace solo dos decadas y segun un informe de 2014 de la OMS es la principal causa de enfermedad y discapacidad de ninos, ninas y adolescentes entre 10 y 19 anos de edad.

En America Latina, la depresion es la primera causa de enfermedad mental, y afecta entre el 19% y 24% de la poblacion adulta, aunque apenas existen datos sobre como afecta el trastorno a ninos o sobre como se trata.

Image copyright thinkstock Image caption La depresion en la ninez se empezo a reconocer tan solo hace dos decadas.

Pero la OMS no recomienda su tratamiento con antidepresivos.

Y Shekhar Saxena, directora de salud mental de la OMS, explico que ""el uso de antidepresivos en ninos y jovenes preocupa por dos motivos: el hecho de que se puedan estar prescribiendo sin motivos suficientes, y el que puedan ocasionar danos importantes"".

Image copyright thinkstock Image caption Los expertos coinciden en que es un problema creciente.

El caso de George Watkings, de 20 anos, es un buen ejemplo.

A George, que vive en el Reino Unido, le recetaron antidepresivos cuando tenia 15 anos, y le dijeron que no existian otras formas de tratamiento para el.

""Mi medico me prescribio los antidepresivos tras 5 minutos de consulta"", le conto a la BBC.

Cinco anos despues, continua tomando los psicofarmacos, aunque se siente ""aterrorizado por lo mal que le hacen sentir"".

Prescripciones ilegales

Otro motivo de preocupacion para el organismo de salud de las Naciones Unidas son las prescripciones ilegales de medicamentos sin licencia para el consumo en menores de 18 anos.

""No existe justificacion alguna para que estos medicamentos, que no fueron probados en esas edades, se prescriban a gente mas joven"", agrego la especialista.

""Existen regulaciones legales y directrices profesionales para el uso no aprobado de medicamentos y eso es algo que preocupa enormemente a la OMS"".

Los antidepresivos son un tratamiento reconocido para curar la depresion en ninos, pero el Instituto Nacional para la Salud y la Excelencia Clinica del Reino Unido (NICE, por sus siglas en ingles), dice que no deberian recetarse inicialmente para sintomas de depresion leve.

Image copyright thiknstock Image caption En algunas ocasiones se prescriben, ilegalmente, medicamentos que no deberian consumir los jovenes menores de 18 anos.

Y, en los casos mas serios, los antidepresivos solamente estan destinados a ser utilizados junto a terapias psicologicas.

Mark Baker, director del Instituto, reconoce que el tratamiento de los problemas de salud mental de ninos y adolescentes es un problema creciente.

La OMS espera que su nueva investigacion actue como una alerta para que los todos paises revisen como gestionan los casos de depresion infantil.

Saxena advierte que sera necesario realizar mas estudios para observar como y cuando se utilizan los antidepresivos en ninos y por cuanto tiempo.

""No hay ningun motivo para que continuen prescribiendolos durante anos"", dijo la experta.

""Los adolescentes y jovenes estan en una fase de desarrollo en la que evolucionan a partir de todo, incluida su propia depresion"", agrego.",[]

bbc.com,,How to Survive a Nuclear Bomb,[],"How to Survive a Nuclear Bomb

We ask Lisa Mac Hale, Head of Development BBC History and Business, about the idea

Tell us about the idea

How To Survive A Nuclear Attack is a new approach to history content designed for 16-24 year olds - a mixed genre animation/live action interactive narrative based the recently declassified British government war game Exercise Regenerate from 1982. Informed by the history of the Cold War nuclear threat, the narrative encourages a player to make difficult decisions to ensure their survival in the wake of a nuclear attack on Britain.

Can you set up the story for us?

The narrative is spread across three days and three nights, beginning just moments before the bombs drop and ending with a rescue by the military on the morning of Day Four. In the intervening time, the government is in hiding and the authorities are crippled. Our player is on their own.

In the course of making decisions, players must avoid being exposed to dangerous situations and radiation that will cause their health and/or morale to deteriorate and potentially result in death. They can also make choices that might improve their health and/or morale, and thereby contribute to their chances of survival. The players health and morale levels are measured onscreen throughout the experience, and their score is assessed at the end of each day  with the potential that they might die on any evening. At the end of the narrative they will be given a total score, and they can choose to re-play at any time to improve their score.

All situations within the game are drawn from fact or expertly informed projections. In addition to Exercise Regenerate our sources include eyewitness accounts of the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, other Cold War preparation exercises such as WINTEX-CIMEX 83, and expert calculations and plans for how Britain would face the aftermath of a nuclear onslaught.

What features make this stand out?

How To Survive a Nuclear Bomb is a scrolling parallex graphic novel which moves upon the user prompting. Interactive decision moments and a game mechanic in which the user steers the course of the story and influences whether they will survive to the end. This creates a stylish yet cost effective way of creating a story for young audiences. We think this allows the user to put themselves at the heart of a story which plays out according to the choices they make. The survival game mechanic also provides repeat playability.

There is also embedded video content which is an interesting contrast to the graphic novel and adds real emotional impact to the story.

At the end of each day you can review a 'secret dossier' containing information relating to points within the story and the consequences of the decision made by the user. Hoodwink history' relates the events from the story back to historical fact or documentation.

How was it made?

bbc.com,,US Air Force veteran found guilty of trying to join IS,[],"Image copyright Reuters Image caption Tairod Pugh wrote to his wife that he had two options, ""victory or martyr""

A New York federal court has found a US Air Force veteran guilty of trying to join the self-styled Islamic State (IS).

Tairod Pugh, who converted to Islam, allegedly tried to cross into Syria from Turkey weeks after he was sacked from his job as a mechanic in Egypt.

He was denied entry and extradited. He faces up to 35 years in prison.

It is the US government's first trial victory in more than 75 prosecutions related to IS sympathisers since 2014.

Islamic State group: the full story

Prosecutors said Pugh, 48, immersed himself in violent IS propaganda before buying a one-way flight from his home in Egypt to Turkey.

He drafted a letter to his Egyptian wife that was found on his computer in which he said he had two options, ""victory or martyr"", prosecutors said.

He also took with him to Istanbul a black face mask, a map showing IS strongholds in Syria and a map of border crossings between Turkey and Syria.

Pugh served as an avionics specialist in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990 and later worked as an Army contractor in Iraq from 2009 to 2010.

Only one other IS-related prosecution has reached trial in the US.

Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem is on trial in Phoenix for plotting with others to attack a Prophet Mohammed cartoon contest in Texas.

Two of his alleged associates were killed in a shootout with police at the event.",[]

Militer Amerika Serikat mengatakan serangan udaranya menyasar komandan kelompok militan yang menamakan diri Negara Islam atau ISIS di Suriah.

Kajian awal menyebutkan Tarkhan Batirashvili -warga Georgia yang dikenal dengan Omar Shishani- kemungkinan termasuk dalam 12 militan yang tewas.

Bagaimanapun belum ada pengukuhan atas kematiannya dari ISIS maupun pendukungnya.

Serangan diluncurkan pada Jumat (04/03) di dekat kota Shaddadi, Suriah barat laut, ketika Shishani dilaporkan memperkuat kekuatan ISIS di sana.

Amerika Serikat menawarkan imbalan senilai Rp65 miliar untuk tertangkapnya Shishani, yang dinyatakan sebagai teroris global sejak September 2014.

Pernyataan dari Departemen Pertahanan AS menyebutkan mereka masih 'menganalisis hasil' dari operasi dengan sasaran Shishani.

Namun seorang pejabat senior yang tidak disebut namanya mengatakan kepada kantor berita AP bahwa kemungkinan komandan ISIS itu terbunuh.

Serangan udara Jumat pekan lalu melibatkan serangkaian pesawat tak berawak dan pesawat tempur reguler.

Shishani dilaporkan memegang beberapa jabatan tinggi di ISIS, antara lain Menteri Perang dan bermarkas di Raqqa, yang mereka nyatakan sebagai ibu kota kekhalifahan ISIS.",[]

Kebakaran hutan dan lahan kembali melanda sebagian wilayah Provinsi Riau sehingga pemerintah setempat menetapkan status siaga darurat sejak Senin (07/03) lalu.

Temuan Badan meteorologi, klimatologi dan geofisika (BMKG) Pekanbaru menunjukkan ada 13 titik panas (hotspot) di Provinsi Riau pada Selasa 8 Maret.

Belum diketahui luas lahan atau hutan yang terbakar, tetapi jumlah titik api di wilayah Riau sempat mencapai 45 pada Jumat (04/03) dan kemudian berkurang setelah hujan sempat turun di sebagian wilayah tersebut.

Laporan media setempat menyebutkan pada pekan lalu titik panas tersebut tersebar di Kabupaten Bengkalis (21 titik), Meranti (1), Dumai (5), Pelalawan (2), Siak (14), Indragiri Hulu (1) dan Indragiri Hilir (1 titik).

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Kebakaran hutan dan lahan kembali melanda sebagian wilayah Provinsi Riau sehingga pemerintah setempat menetapkan status siaga darurat sejak Senin (07/03) lalu.

Kepala Pelaksana Badan penanggulangan bencana daerah (BPBD) Dumai, Tengku Ismed, mengatakan pihaknya -dibantu TNI, polisi dan otoritas terkait- terus mencoba memadamkan kebakaran di wilayahnya dalam beberapa hari terakhir.

""Hingga saat ini kita coba memadamkannya, karena lahan sebagian besar kota Dumai adalah gambut,"" kata Tengku Ismed kepada wartawan BBC Indonesia, Heyder Affan.

""Namanya gambut, padam pada hari ini tetapi mungkin esok lusa bisa muncul titik api di tempat yang sama dan tempat lain,"" ungkapnya.

Di wilayah Dumai, tambahnya, kebakaran melanda setidaknya di empat wilayah yaitu antara lain di Kecamatan Dumai Timur dan Selatan.

Curah hujan rendah

Walaupun menurut BMKG puncak hujan di wilayah Riau terjadi pada akhir bulan Mei, tetapi menurut Tengku Ismed curah hujan di wilayah Dumai termasuk rendah.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Di Kabupaten Bengkalis, upaya pemadaman kebakaran hutan dan lahan di sekitar 10 lokasi terkendala pasokan air yang minim.

""Memang di sebagian wilayah Riau curah hujannya cukup tinggi, namun demikian di Dumai curah hujannya rendah. Kemarin (Selasa/08) sempat hujan, tapi hanya sebentar,"" jelas Ismed.

Karenanya Pemerintah Kota Dumai telah menetapkan siaga darurat kebakaran hutan dan lahan sejak Jumat (04/03) lalu.

""Apalagi dalam jangka waktu tertentu, kebakaran ini tidak dapat kita tanggulangi, maka statusnya kita tingkatkan menjadi tanggap darurat,"" katanya.

Status serupa juga diberlakukan antara lain di Kabupaten Bengkalis dan Meranti yang kemudian ditindaklanjuti oleh pemerintah Provinsi Riau dengan menetapkan status siaga darurat pada tingkat provinsi sejak Senin (07/03) lalu.

Keterbatasan air

Di Kabupaten Bengkalis, upaya pemadaman kebakaran hutan dan lahan di sekitar 10 lokasi dihadapkan kendala pada pasokan air yang minim.

Image copyright 1 Image caption Dua tahun lalu, kerugian akibat kabut asap -yang dihitung selama tiga bulan dari Februari sampai April- di Provinsi Riau menacapi mencapai Rp20 triliun, menurut BNPB.

""Soalnya, kita 'kan masuk ke dalam hutan. Air itu kadang-kadang tidak ada di dalam hutan,"" kata seorang pemadam kebakaran di Kota Bengkalis, yang tidak mau menyebutkan namanya, kepada BBC Indonesia.

""Jadi upaya pemadaman belum tentu berhasil. Hujan yang bisa memadamkannya,"" tambahnya. Saat dihubungi melalui sambungan telepon, dia mengaku baru saja pulang dari lokasi kebakaran hutan.

Belum diketahui berapa hektar luas hutan dan lahan yang terbakar sejak akhir Februari tapi laporan media lokal menyebutkan lahan yang terbakar di Kabupaten Meranti mencapai 45 hektar dan di Kabupaten Siak sekitar 50 hektar.

Tahun 2015 lalu, kebakaran hutan dan lahan serta kabut asap melanda sebagian wilayah di Sumatera Selatan, Jambi, Riau, Kalimantan Barat, Kalimantan Tengah, dan Kalimantan Selatan.

Dua tahun lalu, kerugian akibat kabut asap -yang dihitung selama tiga bulan dari Februari sampai April- di Provinsi Riau mencapai mencapai Rp20 triliun, menurut BNPB.

Kebakaran hutan dan lahan, yang disertai kabut asap di Riau, sempat memantik kemarahan warga Riau yang mengkritik antara lain ketidaktegasan pemerintah dalam mempidanakan pelaku pembakaran.

bbc.com,2016-03-02 00:00:00,Where people were sent to disappear,['Sarah Shearman'],"Panama's Isla Coiba bears all the hallmarks of a perfect desert island: gin-clear water, powdery white sand, a fringe of palm trees against a backdrop of dense, unexplored rainforest. When I arrived on the island, the peaceful beach was scattered with a handful of travellers bobbing in the bath-warm water or taking lazy afternoon naps on the salt-encrusted hammocks.

It was hard to imagine that this island paradise harboured such a dark past  or has such an uncertain future.

For almost a century, Isla Coiba  which along with 38 other protected islands forms Coiba National Marine Park  was home to a notorious island prison, rumoured to be where the country's most dangerous criminals were sent and where political prisoners disappeared. With the island home to various poisonous snakes and insects and surrounded by shark-infested waters, there was no hope of escape for the thousands of prisoners, known as Los Desaparecidos (The Missing).

Over the last century, Panama has undergone  and continues to undergo  enormous environmental change. But in Coiba, a lack of human interference means that nature has been able to thrive. About 80% of Coibas rainforest, which is Central America's largest at 194sqkm, is virgin, and in 2005, shortly after the jail was shut down, the national park was declared a Unesco World Heritage site.

A lack of human interference means that nature has been able to thrive.

Coiba's biodiversity is a huge draw for both scientists and nature-loving travellers. There are a high number of indigenous mammals, birds and plants, and the island is a last refuge for some endangered species, such as the crested eagle and scarlet macaw. Situated on the same underwater mountain range as the Galapagos Islands, Coiba also has very diverse marine life. Coral has formed reefs on top of volcanic rock, and the waters serve a migratory corridor for rays, turtles, pelagic fish, dolphins, whale sharks and humpbacks.

I was drawn to Coiba because of its reputation as one of the worlds most thrilling places to dive. Unlike the Galapagos  or Malepo in Colombia or the Cocos Islands in Costa Rica, both renowned diving destinations on the same underwater mountain range  it is possible to take day trips to Coiba, with most visitors setting off from Santa Catalina, a small mainland fishing village about 20km away. In order to explore more of the marine park's dive sites, I arranged a three-day excursion with the Panama Dive Center, staying in basic accommodation in Coibas ranger station.

The first day's diving did not disappoint. In addition to a dazzling array of fish that included parrot fish, trumpet fish, frog fish, moray eels, jacks, groupers, barracuda and white-tip reef sharks, we also saw bottlenose dolphins and a school of pilot whales. We saw a colourful display of local wildlife on land, too. While eating lunch, a menagerie of animals assembled nearby, creeping out from the forest. As well as orange-coloured iguanas, cappuccino monkeys and vultures, I also spotted a creature that looked like a cross between a beaver and rabbit. My diving instructor David said it was a neques, one of the island's many endemic mammals. With such an abundance of nature, I wondered if Isla Coiba was like Dr Moreau's, with all sorts of beast folk lurking within the unexplored rainforest.

The second day was a touch more dramatic than the first. Looking out to sea early in the morning I spotted an enormous cruise ship  an increasingly common sight in the park. Coibas sleepy beach quickly became a hive of activity, as dozens of cruise staff set out sun loungers, shades, towels, water-sports gear, a barbeque station and a bar. Speedboats then ferried about 150 guests from the ship to the island for the day. Little did the guests know that their advertised desert island experience would turn into more of a Robinson Crusoe-style affair after they left.

Returning to the island for lunch after a couple of morning dives, I learned that the Star Pride cruise ship wouldn't be leaving mid-afternoon as planned. It had in fact run aground on the reef that morning and had holes in its hull.

As the day progressed the cruise ship was noticeably tilting, and over the series of several huddles the captain explained to the guests they would be picked up by another ship that night. I decided to do a light trek into the rainforest to escape the furore on the beach.

After a sweat-drenched ascent, I reached a vista point where I was able to take in the vast scope of the marine park and its many islands. The line between the sea and hazy sky was barely visible, making the sight of a leaning cruise ship plonked in the middle of it all the more incongruous.

Back on the beach, some guests made the best of the situation, enjoying the resulting free drinks and food. But some tempers frayed and others worried about valuables and medication they had left on the boat. In an attempt to placate the situation, one guest strolled up and down the beach singing along with his guitar. I'm not sure at this point if the guests knew about the sandflies that descend on the beach after sunset, or the crocodiles that patrolled it.

I left the chaos again to do a night dive, plunging into the water at dusk when the sky was a milky lilac and emerging almost an hour later to complete darkness. As we returned to the island, the saviour ship was picking up the stranded guests, its lights twinkling like Panama City's flashy skyline.

The guests were gone by about midnight; the original ship was left behind, I learned, for the next couple of weeks. Staff came the following morning to pick up the rubbish that covered the sand and was being picked at by vultures. It was a relief to return to the tranquillity Id experienced the first day.

The islands growing popularity on the cruise-ship circuit is a concern.

The islands growing popularity on the cruise-ship circuit is a concern for many. With a limited water supply and waste disposal, the island cannot sustain such large volumes of visitors. Camilo Consuegra, owner of Panama Dive Center, explained that there are no restrictions on the number of guests that can visit the island. While permits are required for an overnight stay, anyone can come here on a day trip. At Coiba National Park, the responsibility to handle or control the activities has been deposited on the tour operators, which, I think, is a complete mistake, he said. Maintenance of the island's facilities, fishing control in remote areas of the marine reserve and tourism education for the rangers are crucial for the sustainability of this beautiful park.

On our last day, we took a break on another one of Coiba's picture-perfect islands: Isla Rancheria, a Smithsonian Institute outpost for scientific research. There was a sign warning about crocodiles, but the most menacing creature I spotted was a hermit crab, crisscrossing the sand. Under a canopy of trees, which threw finger-shaped shadows on to the sand, I rested, eating a freshly fallen coconut.

Even with the growing crowds and the abundant wildlife, it was easy to find solace in this special park. While its the past lack of human interference that has enabled the park to flourish, it is now up to the visitors, local businesses, scientists, conservationists and Panamas parks authority to ensure it remains this way for future generations to enjoy.

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,11 inventos extraordinarios creados por mujeres que quizas no conoces,"['Margarita Rodr Guez', 'James E', 'Bbc Mundo']","Image copyright Thinkstock

Si miras a tu alrededor los encontraras: son inventos que revolucionaron el mundo.

En algunos casos han salvado vidas. En otros simplemente las han mejorado.

En el Dia Internacional de la Mujer, BBC Mundo te presenta 11 inventos creados por innovadoras de diferentes epocas.

1. Tiras reactivas de orina

El trabajo de Helen Free en el campo de la quimica revoluciono las pruebas para diagnosticar enfermedades y detectar el embarazo en el laboratorio y en los hogares.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption En 2012, la Sociedad Quimica Estadounidense catalogo el invento de Free como un ""hito en la historia de la quimica nacional"".

Free desarrollo, junto a su esposo Alfred, las tiras reactivas que son usadas en todo el mundo para monitorear la diabetes al revelar la presencia de glucosa en la orina del paciente.

Se trata de unas cintas de pocos milimetros de ancho, impregnadas de sustancias quimicas, que al entrar en contacto con los compuestos presentes en la orina reaccionan a cualquier cambio patologico.

Image copyright Salon de la Fama de los Inventores de EE.UU. Image caption Helen Free fue incluida en el Salon de la Fama de los Inventores de Estados Unidos en 2000.

En 1956, la cientifica estadounidense, quien nacio en 1923, lanzo al mercado las primeras tiras reactivas colorimetricas con el nombre de Clinistix, un avance importantisimo en el analisis rapido y efectivo de concentraciones de glucosa en la orina.

Estas pruebas no solo han tenido un gran impacto en los analisis de orina, sino tambien en los estudios de sangre.

2. Farmaco contra la leucemia

Segun el Salon de la Fama de los Inventores de Estados Unidos, Gertrude B. Elion invento el medicamento contra la leucemia conocido como 6-mercaptopurina y los farmacos que facilitaron los trasplantes de rinon.

Nacida en 1918 en Estados Unidos, de padres lituanos, esta bioquimica comenzo a investigar los antagonistas de bloques de acido nucleico. Sus estudios la llevaron a sintetizar 6-mercaptopurina y otro farmaco contra la leucemia llamado 6-tioguanine.

Image copyright SPL Image caption Gertrude Elion gano el Premio Nobel de Fisiologia y Medicina junto a James W. Black y George H. Hitchings.

""La expansion de su investigacion la condujo al Imuran, un derivado del 6-mercaptopurina que bloqueaba el rechazo del cuerpo a tejidos externos. Usado con otras medicinas, Imuran permitio los trasplantes renales de donantes no emparentados"", senala el Salon de la Fama de los Inventores.

La farmacologa tambien lidero el equipo que permitio el desarrollo de medicinas para tratar la gota y un antiviral para combatir las infecciones causadas por el virus del herpes.

En 1988, el Premio Nobel de Fisiologia y Medicina le fue concedido a Elion, James W. Black y George H. Hitchings ""por sus descubrimientos sobre principios clave en el tratamiento con farmacos"".

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Elion es una leyenda de la farmacologia por sus aportes en el desarrollo de medicinas contra la leucemia, la gota y el herpes. (Foto de archivo)

""Por casualidad conoci a un quimico que estaba buscando a un asistente de laboratorio. Aunque no podia pagarme un salario en esa epoca, decidi que la experiencia bien valia la pena"", dijo la cientifica en un texto autobiografico que publica en su pagina web el Premio Nobel.

""Me quede ahi por un ano y medio y finalmente estaba ganando la magnifica suma de US$20 a la semana. Ya habia ahorrado un poco de dinero y, con la ayuda de mis padres, entre a la escuela de posgrado de la Universidad de Nueva York en el otono de 1939. Era la unica mujer en mi clase de quimica, pero a nadie parecia importarle y a mi no me extranaba"", escribio la cientifica que murio en 1999.

3. Metodo para mejorar negativos fotograficos

En 1978, la Asociacion para el avance de las Invenciones y las Innovaciones de Estados Unidos eligio a la quimica Barbara S. Askins como la inventora nacional del ano por haber creado un proceso totalmente nuevo para restablecer el detalle en los negativos de fotografias que habian sido subexpuestos.

Image copyright NASA Image caption Barbara S. Askins nacio en EE.UU. y tuvo dos hijos.

Ese mismo ano, Askins patento dicho metodo, el cual le permitia mejorar las fotos usando materiales radiactivos.

La NASA la habia contratado en 1975 para hallar una mejor manera de revelar fotos astronomicas y geologicas tomadas desde el espacio.

El objetivo era obtener imagenes en las que los detalles pudieran verse con claridad, pues muchas veces se aparecian borrosos y con una definicion muy pobre.

Fue asi como Askins, quien nacio en 1939, hizo visible lo que no se podia ver en las fotos. Sin su invento, dichas imagenes hubiesen sido inutiles, asegura la NASA en su pagina web.

El invento, explica esa organizacion, ""fue tan exitoso que sus usos se expandieron mas alla de la NASA para conseguir mejoras en la tecnologia de los rayos X y en la restauracion de fotos antiguas"".

4. ""Calculadora grafica"" para resolver problemas de transmision de energia

A Edith Clarke, quien nacio en 1883 en Estados Unidos, se la considera una pionera de la ingenieria electrica y de la computacion.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption La calculadora de Clarke resolvia ecuaciones lineales con funciones hiperbolicas diez veces mas rapido que los metodos anteriores.

""Invento una calculadora grafica que simplifico en gran medida los calculos necesarios para determinar las caracteristicas electricas de largas lineas de transmision de electricidad"", indica el Salon de la Fama de los Inventores de Estados Unidos.

Clarke fue una autoridad en la manipulacion de funciones hiperbolicas, circuitos equivalentes, analisis grafico y sistemas de energia electrica.

Ella (Edith Clarke) tradujo lo que muchos ingenieros veian como metodos matematicos esotericos en graficos o en formas mas simples James E. Brittain

La cientifica presento la solicitud de patente de su invento, la calculadora Clarke, en 1921 y le fue otorgada en 1925.

""La carrera de ingenieria de Edith Clarke tuvo como tema central el desarrollo y la diseminacion de metodos matematicos que tendieron a simplificar y reducir el tiempo empleado en calculos laboriosos para resolver problemas de diseno y operacion de sistemas de energia electrica"", explica el doctor James E. Brittain en su ensayo ""From Computer to Electrical Engineer - The Remarkable Career of Edith Clarke"" (""De la computacion a la ingenieria electrica: la extraordinaria carrera de Edith Clarke).

Image copyright Salon de la Fama de los Inventores de EE.UU. Image caption Esta es la patente de la calculadora grafica que le fue otorgada a Clarke en 1925.

""Ella tradujo lo que muchos ingenieros veian como metodos matematicos esotericos en graficos o en formas mas simples, en una epoca en la que los sistemas de energia se iban volviendo mas complejos y cuando los esfuerzos iniciales se enfocaban en desarrollar ayudas electromecanicas para resolver problemas"", indica Brittain.

Clarke fue la primera ingeniera electrica en ser empleada profesionalmente en Estados Unidos y la primera profesora a tiempo completo de ingenieria electrica del pais. Murio en 1959.

5. Vidrio no reflexivo

Las investigaciones de Katharine Blodgett e Irving Langmuir crearon una nueva disciplina cientifica al experimentar con monocapas, peliculas organicas con una sola molecula de espesor, y han tenido aplicaciones practicas en campos tan variados como la conversion de la energia solar y la fabricacion de circuitos integrados.

Image copyright Archivos del Instituto Smithsoniano Image caption Esta foto fue tomada en 1938 cuando Katharine Burr Blodgett trabajaba para los laboratorios de investigacion de General Electric.

""Como asistente de investigacion en General Electric, Blodgett hizo seguimiento al descubrimiento de Langmuir, que consistia en que una capa unica de superficie de agua podia ser transferida a un sustrato solido. Anos despues, ella encontro que el proceso podia ser repetido para crear una pila de multiples capas de cualquier espesor"", explica el Salon de la Fama de Inventores de Estados Unidos.

Blodgett, quien nacio en 1898, profundizo su trabajo y creo recubrimientos no reflexivos de multiples capas de vidrio. Eso llevo a que produjera el primer vidrio 100% transparente del mundo o, como senala la organizacion, el primer vidrio ""verdaderamente invisible"".

""El vidrio no reflexivo elimino la distorsion de la luz que se reflejaba en una gran variedad de equipos opticos incluyendo lentes de sol, telescopios, microscopios, camaras y proyectores"".

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption El invento de Blodgett se ha utilizado con muchos propositos. Uno de ellos es limitar la distorsion en microscopios.

En 1940 obtuvo la patente de su invento, que se conoce como Langmuir-Blodgett Films, en Estados Unidos.

Blodgett tambien fue la primera mujer en obtener un doctorado en fisica en la Universidad de Cambridge. Murio en 1979.

6. Tamices moleculares que son fundamentales en la refinacion del petroleo

Hablar de Edith Flanigen es hablar de refinar el petroleo de una manera mas eficiente, limpia y segura. De hecho, su invento ha sido clave en la produccion de gasolina en todo el mundo.

En 1956, la quimica estadounidense ""empezo a trabajar en la tecnologia emergente de tamices moleculares, estructuras cristalinas microporosas con grandes volumenes internos de vacio y poros de tamanos moleculares"", explica el Salon de la Fama de los Inventores de Estados Unidos.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Las investigaciones de Flanigen han sido clave en el refinamiento del petroleo y los procesos petroquimicos en todo el mundo.

""Estos compuestos pueden ser usados para purificar y separar mezclas complejas y catalizar o acelerar el ritmo de las reacciones de los hidrocarburos y tienen una amplia aplicacion en la refinacion del petroleo y las industrias petroquimicas"".

En 2004, el Instituto de Tecnologia de Massachussetts (MIT, por sus siglas en ingles) le otorgo el premio Lemelson-MIT por sus logros revolucionarios en la tecnologia de zeolitas y tamices moleculares.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption En 2014, el presidente de EE.UU., Barack Obama, le otorgo a Flanigen la maxima distincion que ofrece el gobierno de ese pais a cientificos e innovadores.

Flanigen lidero un equipo de investigadores que descubrio ""(...) mas de dos docenas de estructuras de tamices moleculares y 200 composiciones, muchas de las cuales han sido comercializadas en el refinamiento del petroleo y los procesos petroquimicos para reducir los costos de energia y el desperdicio industrial"", senalo el MIT.

Nacida en 1929, Flanigen es la duena de 108 patentes de Estados Unidos y entre las multiples aplicaciones de sus investigaciones estan la purificacion del agua y el saneamiento ambiental.

7. Maquina para hacer bolsas de papel

La estadounidense Margaret Knight, quien nacio en 1838, paso a la historia por haber inventado la maquina para hacer bolsas de papel de fondo plano.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption En 1871, Knight obtuvo la patente de su maquina, tras una larga batalla legal contra Charles Annan, quien habia copiado su idea.

""La invencion de Knight revoluciono la industria de la bolsa de papel al reemplazar el trabajo de 30 personas con una maquina"", dice el Salon de la Fama de los Inventores de Estados Unidos.

De forma automatica, su maquina cortaba el papel, lo doblaba y pegaba las partes senaladas para crear la bolsa.

Image copyright Salon de la Fama de los Inventores de EE.UU. Image caption Este es el documento de la patente de la maquina para hacer bolsas de Knight.

""Antes de que Knight inventara la maquina, las bolsas con el fondo plano solo se podian hacer manualmente y a un gran costo"", indica la organizacion.

Su invento fue usado en todo el mundo y permitio la produccion masiva de ese tipo de bolsas. De hecho, una variacion de su maquina todavia era usada a fines del siglo XX.

Entre 1870 y 1915, a Knight se le concedieron patentes de al menos 26 inventos mas. Murio en 1914.

8. Panal desecheable

Aunque en 1951 a la estadounidense Marion Donovan se le otorgo la patente por haber creado una cubierta impermeable para panales, esta arquitecta de la Universidad de Yale es reconocida mundialmente como la madre del panal desechable.

En 1998, cuando Donovan murio, el periodico estadounidense The New York Times escribio en su obituario: ""Tenia 81 anos y habia ayudado a encabezar una revolucion industrial y domestica al inventar el precursor del panal desechable"".

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Ademas de solucionar el problema de la absorcion del panal, Donovan introdujo los botones, con lo que dejo a un lado los imperdibles.

""Impulsada por la tarea frustrante y repetitiva de cambiar los panales de tela sucios, la ropa y las sabanas de la cama de su hijo, Donovan creo una cubierta para panal que le permitia mantener a su bebe seco"", cuenta el Salon de la Fama de los Inventores de Estados Unidos.

""A diferencia de otros productos en el mercado, el suyo fue hecho con una tela que permitia que la piel del bebe respirara y tambien incluia unos botones en vez de imperdibles"".

Donovan llamo su invento Boater, pero, en un primer momento, recibio el rechazo de los fabricantes.

Por esa razon, decidio comercializar su capa ella misma y, tras recibir la patente, le vendio los derechos a una corporacion por US$1 millon.

Anos despues, el ingeniero industrial Victor Mills, quien trabajaba en Procter&Gamble, lideraria el equipo que produjo el primer panal desechable para el mercado como se conoce hoy en dia.

9. Senalizacion maritima con bengalas

""En una epoca en la que las mujeres parecian hacer poco mas que mantener la casa y criar a las familias, Martha Coston estaba ocupada salvando vidas al perfeccionar el sistema nocturno de senalizacion de bengalas"", destaca el libro ""The Inventions of Martha Coston"" (""Los inventos de Martha Coston""), de Holly Cefrey.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption En esta imagen se ve el mastil de un buque cuando fue lanzada una senal.

Coston desarrollo un sistema de destellos pirotecnicos, con base en unos bocetos dejados por su esposo antes de morir, para que los barcos pudieran comunicarse entre si y con el personal en tierra en la oscuridad y cuando los separaban grandes distancias.

Coston le vendio el sistema, que consistia en destellos rojos, blancos y verdes, a la marina de Estados Unidos.

""El sistema de comunicacion nocturna le dio a la Union una ventaja decisiva en el Guerra Civil y la compania Coston, fundada para producir las bengalas, se mantuvo en el negocio hasta el final del siglo XX"", explica el Salon de la Fama de los Inventores de Estados Unidos.

Image copyright AP Image caption En esta foto de noviembre de 2015, un voluntario usaba humo anaranjado como una senal para inmigrantes que se acercaban en un bote a la isla griega de Lesbos, tras salir de Turquia. Ese metodo evoca el invento de Coston.

Coston, quien nacio en 1826 y murio en 1904, paso 10 anos desarrollando el sistema antes de patentarlo en 1859.

""El sistema de codigos y senalizacion con bengalas Coston fue usado por el Servicio de Socorro y el Servicio Meteorologico de Estados Unidos, instituciones militares en Inglaterra, Francia, Holanda, Italia, Austria, Dinamarca y Brasil, buques mercantes comerciales y yates privados"", indica la organizacion estadounidense.

10. Limpiaparabrisas

A Mary Anderson se le ocurrio la idea del limpiaparabrisas cuando viajaba en un tranvia por Nueva York en un dia de nieve a principios del siglo XX.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption El limpiaparabrisas lo ideo Anderson cuando observo a un conductor de tranvia saliendo a limpiar la nieve una y otra vez.

""Anderson observo que los conductores de tranvias con frecuencia tenian que abrir sus ventanas para poder ver en medio del clima inclemente, algunas veces incluso debian detener el tranvia y salir para limpiar la ventana"", cuenta el Salon de la Fama de los Inventores de Estados Unidos.

""Su idea consistio en una palanca dentro del vehiculo que controlaba un brazo equipado con una escobilla de goma. La palanca, con un contrapeso para mantener el brazo limpiador en contacto con la ventana, podia mover la escobilla a traves del parabrisas para asi eliminar la lluvia o la nieve"".

Image copyright Salon de la Fama de los Inventores de EE.UU. Image caption Esta es la aplicacion que introdujo Anderson para obtener la patente del limpiaparabrisas.

Segun la organizacion, con su patente de 1903 el invento de Anderson fue el primer dispositivo eficaz para limpiar parabrisas.

Anderson nacio en 1866 y murio en 1953.

11. La superfibra Kevlar

Stephanie Kwolek fue una quimica estadounidense de origen polaco que en 1965 descubrio una rama increible de polimeros cristalinos liquidos.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption La fibra Kevler es usada hoy en dia en cientos de productos, desde trajes ignifugos, neumaticos y blindaje antimetralla, hasta cascos de Formula 1 y los que usan los soldados.

La cientifica, que nacio en 1923, ""se especializo en procesos de temperaturas bajas para la creacion de cadenas moleculares largas, lo que condujo al descubrimiento de fibras sinteticas a base de petroleo de gran rigidez y resistencia"", indica el Salon de la Fama de Mujeres de Estados Unidos.

La fibra mas famosa que resulto de sus investigaciones fue el poliparafenileno tereftalamida o Kevlar, una fibra de polimero cinco veces mas fuerte que el acero.

Image copyright AP Image caption Kwolek posando con uno de las decenas de productos que usan Kevlar.

Se trata del tejido de alta resistencia que es usado en todo el mundo para fabricar cientos de productos como chalecos antibalas, cables de fibra optica, partes de aviones, cascos, canoas.

""Sabia que habia hecho un descubrimiento"", dijo Kwolek en una entrevista. ""No grite 'Eureka' pero estaba muy emocionada, al igual que todo el laboratorio, y la direccion tambien estaba emocionada porque estabamos ante algo nuevo y diferente"".

Image copyright AP Image caption Kwolek, quien murio en 2014, formo parte de la Academia Nacional de las Ciencias de Estados Unidos.

Ademas de salvar vidas en todo el mundo, el poderoso tejido que desarrollo Kwolek genera cientos de millones de dolares en ventas anuales en todo el planeta, como lo destaca el Salon de la Fama de los Inventores de Estados Unidos.

Sus investigaciones cientificas tambien hicieron que a Kwolek se le otorgaran 17 patentes en Estados Unidos, entre ellas, por supuesto, la del Kevlar.",[]

Howard Scott Warshaw, the gifted programmer who made it, explains how it was rushed out in a matter of weeks - and how he feels about those events in California now.

Spielberg was unimpressed.

""Couldn't you do something more like Pac-Man?"" he asked.

It was July 1982 and Atari, then one of the world's most successful tech companies, had just paid a reported $21m for the video game rights to Spielberg's new blockbuster, ET the Extra-Terrestrial.

Howard Scott Warshaw was the programmer tasked with designing the game.

""I was stunned,"" says Warshaw. ""Here was Steven Spielberg, one of my idols, suggesting that I knock off the game! My impulse was to go, 'Well, gee, Steven, couldn't you make something more like The Day The Earth Stood Still?'""

Warshaw's stock was high at Atari. The 24-year-old had just finished the video game of Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark. Spielberg considered Warshaw a ""certifiable genius"" and 36 hours earlier Warshaw had been hand-picked for their next collaboration.

""It was a day that will live in infamy in my life forever,"" says Warshaw. ""I was sitting in my office and I get a call from the Atari CEO. He said, 'Howard, we need the ET video game done. Can you do it?'

""And I said, 'Absolutely, yes I can!'""

Games for the Atari 2600 were distributed on cartridges that took weeks to manufacture. If ET was to be in the shops for Christmas, Warshaw had a tight deadline.

""The CEO goes, 'We need it for 1 September.' That left five weeks to do it! Normally it'd be six to eight months to do a game, not five weeks.

""Then he said, 'Design the game and on Thursday morning, be at the airport and there will be a Learjet waiting to take you to see Spielberg.'

""I'm not sure exactly what I was full of but whatever it was, I was overflowing with it.""

Warshaw drew up his pitch to Spielberg, and travelled from the Atari headquarters in Sunnyvale, California to Los Angeles. His idea was an adventure game in which the player had to help ET phone home by collecting components to make an inter-planetary telephone. The player would have to dodge government agents and scientists in order to complete the mission.

""I got down to Spielberg and I laid out the whole design,"" he says. ""I told him, 'I think it's really important that we do something innovative. ET is a breakthrough movie and I think we need a breakthrough game.'

""I talked him out of the idea of a Pac-Man knock-off. But the key was to design a game that I could deliver in five weeks.""

Atari needed ET to be a hit. In 1982 sales had reached a peak of $2bn but the company was losing market share to home computers like the Commodore 64, which could do more than play games.

""It was the hardest I've ever worked on anything in my life,"" says Warshaw, who was the game's sole programmer. ""I started working at the office but after a while I realised there was a problem; I still have to go home to sleep and eat occasionally.

""So we had another development system installed in my house so that I would never be more than two minutes away from working on the code except when I was driving.

""There was a manager who was assigned to make sure I was eating so that I'd be able to keep going.

""When it came to the end of the process, my reaction was, 'Wow, I did it!'""

Atari ordered an initial run of four million copies and budgeted a reported $5m on what would be, at the time, the biggest-ever advertising campaign for a video game.

""ET needs help from his human friend - and that's you!"" read the magazine ad. Television commercials ran for weeks. Spielberg himself appeared in a promotional video, whilst Warshaw was flown to the London premiere of ET and given a seat in front of the Princess of Wales.

""The bosses believed that as long as we put anything out the door with ET's name on it would sell millions and millions,"" he says.

To begin with, the game was ""right up there on the Billboard top sellers"" but word began to spread that there were serious problems.

Image caption Howard was flown to the London premiere of ET in December 1982

""It was a finished game but it certainly wasn't perfect,"" Warshaw says. ""There were too many opportunities where you could suddenly wind up in an odd situation. That was too much for a lot of people and caused them to put the game down.""

Players complained that the ET character would inexplicably fall into pits and get stuck. As one 10-year-old told The New York Times: ""It wasn't fun.""

Image caption One of the infamous pits that players had trouble avoiding

Atari soon realised that ET was not going home. In early December 1982 it announced ""disappointing"" sales for the year and the value of its parent company Warner Communications plunged. The results triggered steep drops in the value of other video game makers.

""After the Christmas season it was starting to come back from retailers,"" says Warshaw. ""It still sold nearly 1.5 million units, but when you needed to sell four million, that's not good enough.""

By the second quarter of 1983, Atari's parent company announced losses of $310m.

""Things just started to unravel,"" says Warshaw. ""It's awesome to be credited with single-handedly bringing down a billion-dollar industry with eight kilobytes of code. But the truth is a little more complex.""

Consumers were turning to the home computer and the market was saturated with video games. In a bid to avoid collapse, prices - and much of the workforce - were slashed. But it was futile and in July 1984 Warner offloaded Atari for $240m.

""I took some time off to recover from the whole experience,"" says Warshaw. ""I went into real estate for a couple of years and hated it.

""Eventually I went back to technology, returning to video games as a manager and director, but it had lost the charm by then.""

Creatively unfulfilled, Warshaw undertook projects in writing and TV production.

""I knew I was done with the industry but I couldn't envision an alternative. I became depressed.""

Warshaw's solution was ""to throw reason to the wind"" and in 2008 he retrained as a psychotherapist.

Image caption Despite the ET fiasco, Howard designed some of Atari's best-selling games

""Maybe a part of me really wanted to compensate for all the trauma and depression I created with the ET game,"" he says. ""But in reality it's something I always wanted to do.""

Today Warshaw bills himself as The Silicon Valley Therapist, ""fluent in both English and nerd"". Does he use his own story of colossal failure with clients?

""Sometimes I do,"" he admits.

""But every therapist uses their own experience with their clients. To me it's a very natural thing. Programmers and therapists are all systems analysts. It's just that I've moved on to a much more sophisticated hardware.""

In April 2014 Warshaw was given his own chance to obtain closure on the ET fiasco. A film company was making a documentary about a legend that had persisted for 30 years - that in 1983 Atari had buried truckloads of the unsold ET games in the New Mexico desert.

Image copyright AP Image caption In April 2014 copies of ET were excavated from a dump in Alamogordo, New Mexico

""I never believed it, I just thought it was absurd,"" says Warshaw.

The city of Alamogordo granted permission for a public excavation to take place. Warshaw was invited to attend.

""When we arrived, there was a long, long line of fans from all over the country who had travelled to see this,"" he says. ""It was an odd thing to sit there and literally watch your past being dug up.""

The excavation confirmed that Atari products were indeed buried at the dump and Warshaw was filmed at the moment a battered and crushed copy of ET was pulled from the ground.

""I became extremely emotional,"" he says. ""This little game that I had written in five weeks more than 30 years ago was still generating excitement. I was full of gratitude.

""Is ET really the worst game of all time? Probably not. But the story of the fall of the video game industry needed a face and that was ET.

""I actually prefer it when people do identify it as the worst game of all time because I also did Yars Revenge and that's frequently identified as one of the best of all time. So between the two, I have the greatest range of any designer in history!""

Brazilian prosecutors are filing charges against ex-President Lula da Silva in a money laundering investigation, officials say.

He denies any wrongdoing and says the charges are politically-motivated.

The accusations are part of a major corruption investigation at the state oil company, Petrobras.

Lula and his wife, Marisa Leticia, face questions over the alleged ownership of a sea-front penthouse in the exclusive resort of Guaruja.

The charges still have to be formally accepted by a judge.

Prosecutors have announced a news conference for later on Thursday.

Lula's lawyer, Cristiano Zanin Martins, said he did not have official access to the accusations against the former leader.

""This action confirms the bias [against Lula] in this whole process,"" he said.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption The probe centres on a luxury penthouse in the resort of Guaruja, estimated to be worth up to $550,000

Prosecutors say one of the country's biggest construction firms, OAS, carried out extensive refurbishment on the penthouse.

Officially the apartment belongs OAS, which is under investigation. It has been accused of paying bribes to politicians and senior officials at Petrobras to secure lucrative contracts.

Lula, 70, denies all accusations and says he never owned the apartment. He also accuses the prosecutor in the case of being arbitrary, says the BBC's Daniel Gallas in Sao Paulo.

The former president was detained last Friday for questioning over the three-storey penthouse.

His high-profile detention led to criticism not only from his supporters but also from judges and politicians, who said the measure was unnecessary.

Lula's supporters say the attacks on him are aimed at tarnishing his reputation, amid rumours that he may run for office again in 2018.

He was Brazil's president from 2003 to 2011 and was succeeded in office by his political protege, Dilma Rousseff.

bbc.com,,What does Gibraltar think about Brexit?,"['Bbc World Service Gibraltar', 'Leana Hosea']","Image copyright Alamy

The UK will vote in June on whether it wants to leave the EU or remain. The residents of Gibraltar - the British overseas territory on the tip of Spain - will also have the right to cast a vote.

High up on the slope of the Rock of Gibraltar on the terrace of their home, lawyer and native Gibraltarian Damon Bossino can see how close Spain is - only five miles across the bay.

His Spanish wife Rosa is from La Linea, just across the Spanish border and they met 20 years ago when she came to work in the same law firm in Gibraltar.

""Rosa would most likely not have been here in Gibraltar if it weren't for the EU,"" says Damon. ""No, that's true, we would never have met,"" says Rosa. ""I feel Gibraltarian now and my kids are Gibraltarian too.""

Being part of the European Union is not something that has ever been an issue for Gibraltarians, says Damon. ""We are geographically connected with Europe. We are a melting pot of European cultures. So we don't have those hang-ups.""

The ringtone on Rosa's mobile phone reminds Damon of one of their many worries. ""You wonder if things like data roaming charges will go - would that come back in if Gibraltar weren't a member of the EU?""

Image caption The Bossino family worry that crossing between Gibraltar and Spain could be made much more difficult if the UK votes to leave the EU

But the couple have more serious fears than an expensive phone bill. It's all to do with the antagonism of Spain.

""The frontier,"" explains Damon, ""could be shut if Spain became nasty, as it's capable of doing towards Gibraltar because of its sovereignty claim.""

If that happens, Rosa says she would be devastated. ""I don't want Britain to vote yes, because there is a possibility that the Spanish will decide to close the frontier. For me that would be, well the worst decision in my life because I cannot see my parents.""

Gibraltarians are often said to be more British than the British. Walking down Main Street they have all the shops you would normally see on the British High Street - like Marks and Spencer and BHS. The iconic red telephone boxes are still in use, unlike most of the UK.

There's a military re-enactment group who march through town every Saturday with imitation rifles held at the shoulder, celebrating British victory over the Spanish.

Image caption Military re-enactment group: A weekly reminder of British victory over Spain

One might assume that this patriotic territory would share the concern of many Britons that the European Union was eroding UK sovereignty and want out. But the memory of a past when tensions between Spain and Gibraltar led to the border's closure from 1969 to 1985, forcing people to journey to and from the territory by sea, still casts its shadow.

It's not so much that all Gibraltarians love the European Union project, but rather that many see the EU as the only force standing in the way of a tricky relationship with Spain.

""Remember that Spain closed the frontier in 1969,"" says Chief Minister Fabian Picardo at 6 Convent Place, the government's headquarters. ""It was only in the negotiations for the Spanish to access the then European Economic Community, that Spain finally opened the frontier. We see the EU as a guarantor of the freedom of movement of people.""

Image caption Fabian Picardo, Gibraltar's chief minister

Picardo says some 10,000 people cross the border from Spain to work in Gibraltar daily and it's that freedom of movement of people and services that is vital to the economy. He believes the fears that the Spanish could shut the border again are justified because he says ""they still get funny about it"" and restrict or slow the flow of traffic across the border.

Recently Spain's acting Foreign Minister, Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo, told Spanish National Radio that if Britain were to leave the EU ""we would be talking about Gibraltar the very next day"".

At the end of a working day there's a long line of cars queuing at the frontier to go back into Spain and the commuters I spoke to didn't think Brexit would be good for Gibraltar either. ""We are so integrated and you've got great opportunity across the border as there's a lot of industry,"" says Paul, a Gibraltarian. ""Having the UK separated by the Channel does lead to a sense of us and them between the UK and Europe.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Queuing up for the border patrol between Spain and Gibraltar

It's very difficult to find anyone who will say they are in favour of Britain leaving the EU, but finally I do find one man. He doesn't want to be named as he says the territory is too small and he would rather his neighbours didn't know his opinions. ""I'm all in favour of Brexit because I put Britain first. It will have an effect on Gibraltar, but it'll be an effect that people will come to live with.""

It's not an opinion shared by the president of the Chamber of Commerce in Gibraltar, Christian Hernandez, who believes Gibraltar's year-on-year GDP growth of 8% could be negatively affected. The pillars of the economy are financial services, online gaming, the port and insurance.

According to Hernandez, Gibraltar's lower tax rate means a huge number of cars in the UK are insured by a Gibraltarian company. ""In our financial services one of the things Gibraltar does offer is that businesses here can 'passport' their services into Europe - particularly banking and insurance. If we take the EU out of that formula it could be bad for Gibraltar.""

Image caption Red phone boxes are a reminder of Gibraltar's unique status

If the UK voted to leave it would mean that Gibraltar would be out of the EU. The British government would negotiate an exit and it's not known what those terms would be, but Gibraltar would be likely to push for the fullest access to the single market.

""It's not impossible to see that if the UK were to vote to leave the EU it would be negotiating a new status for access to the single market in which Gibraltar would want to piggyback that process,"" says Picardo. ""There may even be arrangements which allow Gibraltar further integration into the single market than the UK might consider is appropriate for the mainland UK."" In these unchartered waters success is not guaranteed, making Brexit a gamble the minister would bet against.

""If you believe some of the polls [in the UK],"" says Picardo, ""the vote might be on a knife edge and the 22,000 people of Gibraltar might just turn that"".

The Rock of Gibraltar is one of the territory's main attractions, where Barbary Macaque monkeys wander about grooming one another and think nothing of jumping on your car.

From the viewpoint overlooking the 2.6-square mile British territory three flags fly in the breeze - the Union Jack, the Castle and Key flag of Gibraltar and that of the European Union.

But that complex mix of identity and allegiance may soon be hotly debated.

bbc.com,,When George Martin met The Beatles: The story of Love Me Do,"['Mark Savage', 'Music Reporter']","Image copyright Rex Features Image caption The Beatles recorded all of their albums with George Martin, although his work on Let It Be was initially uncredited

In May 1962, The Beatles were in the middle of their residency in Hamburg when an excitably-written telegram arrived from London.

Their manager informed them he had secured a recording contract with a subsidiary of EMI Records, and they should return home for their initial recording session.

It wasn't true.

In fact, all Brian Epstein had secured was an audition with producer George Martin who was, at that time, best known for making comedy records with Peter Sellers and Bernard Cribbins.

I thought their music was rubbish George Martin

Furthermore, Martin himself was sceptical of the band's chances.

""I wasn't too impressed with the tape Brian Epstein had played me,"" he told Desert Island Discs in 1996. ""There was something there but I couldn't find out whether it was worthwhile or not.

""What I said to Brian was, 'if you want me to judge them on what you're playing me, I'm sorry, I'll have to turn you down.'

""He was so disappointed. I felt really sorry for him, actually because he was such an earnest young man. So I gave him a lifeline. I said, 'If you want to bring them down from Liverpool, I'll give them an hour in the studio.'""

Image copyright Rex Features Image caption The first Abbey Road session featured (L-R) Paul McCartney, George Harrison and John Lennon, with Pete Best on drums

The band duly set up in Studio Three at Abbey Road on the afternoon of 6 June, 1962 but their road-worn instruments initially caused some problems. Worst of all was Paul McCartney's amp, which was distorting so badly that engineers had to wheel up a vast replacement speaker from EMI's echo chamber.

""I got nothing out of The Beatles' equipment except for a load of noise, hum and goodness-knows-what,"" engineer Norman Smith later told Sound On Sound.

Problems solved, the band launched into their first song - a cover of Consuelo Velazquez's bolero ballad Besame Mucho (Kiss Me A Lot) - at around 19:00.

It failed to impress.

""I remember Martin taking a quick look at them and leaving for tea,"" said sound engineer Ken Townsend.

I never suggested that Pete Best must go George Martin

But when the band launched into their next track, Lennon and McCartney's Love Me Do, tape engineer Chris Neal was sent scurrying down to the Abbey Road canteen to grab his boss.

He arrived and took over the session, although he was still unconvinced.

""I thought their music was rubbish,"" he told the BBC's Arena programme in 2011.

""I couldn't really make out for myself what I was listening for - because I was so conditioned to [hearing] a solo singer with a backing group. But here I had four people who were all doing all sorts of things.

""It wasn't Cliff Richard and the Shadows, that's for sure.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Over the years, Martin encouraged and facilitated the band's more outlandish experiments

The band went on to record two more numbers - P.S. I Love You and Ask Me Why - before the session ended around 22:00.

Martin invited the band back to the control room and explained, at great length, where he felt they were going wrong.

""We gave them a long lecture about their equipment and what would have to be done about it if they were to become recording artists,"" recalled Norman Smith.

In particular, Martin focused on Pete Best's drumming, explaining that what worked on stage at Liverpool's Cavern Club wasn't appropriate in the studio.

Best was sacked and replaced by Ringo Starr as a result (although even he wasn't permitted to play on the later, finished version of Love Me Do - that was done by Scots session drummer Andy White, who died last year).

Best's mother was furious, and phoned Martin to complain. She later told Liverpudlian journalist Bill Harry (who covered The Beatles' rise to fame for the Mersey Beat newspaper) that the producer had been taken aback by the band's decision.

""I never suggested that Pete Best must go,"" she reported him as saying. ""All I said was that, for the purposes of The Beatles' first record, I would rather use a session man. I never thought Brian Epstein would let him go. He seemed to be the most saleable commodity as far as looks went.""

Image copyright Rex Features Image caption Martin later admitted he wanted to sign a rock band because he envied the success fellow-producer Norrie Paramor was having with Cliff Richard

Back at Abbey Road, Martin gave The Beatles the chance to respond to his dressing down. ""I've laid into you for quite a long time,"" he said. ""You haven't responded. Is there anything you don't like?""

""Well, for a start,"" replied George Harrison, ""I don't like your tie.""

The quip broke the ice and The Beatles relaxed into comedy mode.

""For the next 15 to 20 minutes they were pure entertainment,"" recalled Norman Smith. ""I had tears running down my face.""

Despite his misgivings, Martin eventually decided The Beatles had ""the potential to make a hit record"" and gave them a recording deal on 6 June (backdated by two days so as to secure copyright to the recording session).

He later admitted it was their ""tremendous charisma"" rather than their music that won him over.

""When you are with them, you are all the better for being with them and when they leave you feel a loss,"" he told Sue Lawley.

""I fell in love with them. It's as simple as that.""",[]

bbc.com,,US election 2016: Has Bernie Sanders changed the Democratic race?,[],"Image copyright AP Image caption Bernie Sanders' focus on international trade swayed many voters

Although the latest primary and caucus elections highlighted Donald Trump's continuing march to the Republican nomination for the US presidency, many in the US media chose to focus on the shock win for Bernie Sanders in the Democratic battle in Michigan.

The New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times and Huffington Post were among those leading their online coverage with Mr Sanders' victory over Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton there.

Many writers suggested the issue of international trade deals had swayed blue-collar voters, many of whom believe such agreements have cost American jobs.

But while the victory is seen as invigorating Mr Sanders' campaign, many also point to Mrs Clinton's huge win in Mississippi. This has given her an overall victory in the number of delegates secured on the night.

Cash donations

Sam Frizell writing in Time magazine said Mr Sanders' win ""in the large, demographically diverse state with a big manufacturing base is crucial for the survival of his campaign, and he proved with his Tuesday night coup that he can still win a hard-fought contest despite lagging in the overall delegate count"".

Ben Geier, writing for Fortune, says Mr Sanders' victory has ""changed the race for the Democratic nomination"".

He adds: ""He will likely be able to use this win to get another round of fundraising, as most of his donors are individuals who haven't maxed out their donation totals; if they gave $10 in October, he can ask them to give another $10 now. And given the general enthusiasm of Sanders voters, it's a good bet a lot of them will.""

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Hillary Clinton may need to ""rethink her economic message""

The Washington Post says the Michigan result ""raises the stakes for a candidates' debate on Wednesday from delegate-rich Florida"", which holds its primary next Tuesday.

Yamiche Alcindor and Patrick Healy in the New York Times, write that Mr Sanders' ""startling upset"" in Michigan came by ""hammering Mrs Clinton on an issue that resonated in this still-struggling state: her past support for trade deals that workers here believe robbed them of manufacturing jobs"".

They add: ""For Mrs Clinton, it was a stinging defeat... a reminder of her weakness among two key voting blocs: working-class white men and independent voters. The setback will almost certainly lead her to sharpen or even rethink her economic message, which does not seem to be reaching voters who feel betrayed by the Democratic Party's embrace of free trade and left behind by the forces of globalisation and deregulation.""

John Cassidy, in The New Yorker, writes that although Mr Trump and Mr Sanders differ wildly, ""they both claim that the existing political system is broken, and that radical measures and new leaders are needed to fix it"".

""If this message were to prove equally successful in other industrial states, such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, it would have big implications for the general election in addition to the primaries.""

He says that although it appears Mr Sanders' chance on closing the delegate gap with Mrs Clinton ""appears slim"", he ""could remain competitive until the big primaries in New York and California, where he is hoping to pull off more upsets. This calculus may seem unlikely. Until last night, however, it seemed unlikely that he would win in Michigan"".

Alex Seitz-Wald, for MSNBC, writes that Mr Sanders' ""advisers had long predicted the beginning of March would be rough for them, thanks to the high concentration of southern states with large African-American populations that so far have favoured Clinton by wide margins.

""But with those states now in the rear view mirror, Sanders' campaign expects to sail into friendlier waters later in the month, beginning next Tuesday (when votes are held in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio).""",[]

bbc.com,2016-02-25 00:00:00,Do toddlers learn like chimps?,['Colin Barras'],"About 5,500 years ago, one group of humans invented something truly revolutionary: the wheel. Almost overnight news of the innovation spread far and wide, and wheels appeared virtually simultaneously in Europe, the Eurasian steppes and the Near East.

In fact, wheels became popular so quickly that some archaeologists say we cant be sure exactly where the wheel was invented - although Mesopotamia seems like a good bet.

According to Eva Reindl at the University of Birmingham in the UK, stories like this tell us a lot about what makes us human. Surprisingly, its not that humans worked out how to make wheels thats important - its the fact that other populations quickly caught on and copied the idea.

Reindl and her colleagues say that other great apes are different. By and large a chimpanzee, gorilla or orangutan wont copy another apes inventions. Each ape, says Reindl, learns for itself how to solve a problem. These species lack our cumulative culture - they are constantly reinventing the wheel.

This raises a question, though. If humans rely so much on a culturally accumulated body of knowledge that they access by imitating others, have we lost the ability to invent our own solutions to basic problems?

When it comes to learning how to crack a tough nut with a wooden tool, for instance, are chimpanzees actually smarter than we are precisely because they know how to experiment for themselves?

Humans and other apes are apparently born in the same state.

Reindl and her colleagues decided to find out. They call our habit of copying others high-fidelity social learning  and they say it is so ubiquitous in human societies that trying to find people who havent been exposed to it is a challenge. They sidestepped the problem by conducting their experiments with toddlers, who have had relatively little exposure to other humans and less opportunity to imitate human tool use.

They gave the toddlers a series of challenges, which we know wild chimpanzees easy solve with simple wooden tools. One task involved using a stick to crack nuts - replaced by plastic shells in the toddler experiments. Another challenge tested whether the toddlers, like chimps, could use a stick to extract honey from a beehive - although in the experiment the researchers swapped the hive for a plastic tube from which the toddlers could extract paint for drawing.

For almost all challenges, the children passed with flying colours - they completed the tasks as well as a great ape might. Even though our species relies on learning from others, it seems  as youngsters, at least  were still capable of thinking entirely for themselves. In this particular domain, humans and other apes are apparently born in the same state.

Cumulative culture is probably uniquely human but its a subject of hot debate

Slightly paradoxically, Reidl says that finding similarities in the way humans and other apes are born can actually help us better define what really does make us unique as a species - something that is surprisingly difficult to pin down. This is because it highlights behaviours that we develop but that other apes do not.

For instance, although we might start out life with the same sort of tool-using capability that a chimpanzee possesses, we soon begin to behave in a more sophisticated way - precisely because we watch others and tap into the collective human wisdom that has accrued down the generations.

My colleagues and I work from the standpoint that cumulative culture is probably uniquely human, says Riedl. But its a subject of hot debate in the field right now.

On the other side of the debate are researchers like Christophe Boesch at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. With his colleagues, Boesch has spent a considerable amount of time studying the chimpanzees in the Tai National Park in Ivory Coast.

Our study of different tool selection in Tai chimpanzees shows clearly that some important social component is at work in how chimpanzee learn to select tools, he says. In this region, at least, the apes actually do learn some tool use by carefully copying those around them, says Boesch, and this leads to different cumulative cultures in different chimpanzee groups, just as different human societies might have different cumulative cultures.

We still have so much to learn about tool use in chimpanzees, says Boesch - including the complete range of tool use behaviours these apes show, how common each behaviour is, and how individual chimpanzees learn to use tools for themselves.

It's not yet clear whether cumulative culture separates us from other apes. The scientific jury clearly hasnt yet arrived at a decision. When consensus does emerge well know whether our sister species share our ability to imitate others  or whether they are doomed to reinvent the same things over and over again.",[]

bbc.com,2016-02-29 00:00:00,The city of 187 different countries,['Lindsey Galloway'],"A haven for expats and loved by locals, Geneva attracts people from around the world for its economic opportunity, lakeside beauty and Mont Blanc views. Home to more international organisations  such as the Red Cross and the United Nations  than any other place in the world, the city has a decidedly global feel. More than 40% of residents are from outside Switzerland, with 187 different countries represented in the mix.

Despite the international influences, Geneva still lays claim to its own particular character and history. In the 16th Century, John Calvin, a major Protestant reformer, gave many of his revolutionary sermons here. Geneva-born Henri Dunant, a follower of the Calvinist faith, helped found the Red Cross in Geneva in 1863, and these humanitarian ideas inspired the first Geneva Convention in 1864.

The spirit of Calvin still influences locals, and the tradition of moral discipline and minimalism can sometimes clash with more extravagant expat tastes.

Locals are very laid back, but are rather conservative types that find interaction with expats a bit difficult, said Niyazi Gunay, originally from Turkey, who has lived here for 15 years and works for Your Local Cousin, a start-up that matches travellers with residents.

Cedric Viquerat, a Geneva native who now lives in the US, admitted that the Genevois stay in tight-knit cliques and it can be hard for new residents to break in. Expats, on the other hand, bring an energetic enthusiasm that makes bonding among other foreigners relatively easy.

Regardless of origin, all residents mingle in summertime as Lake Geneva and its Jet dEau  the landmark fountain that shoots water 140m in the air  attract crowds to the manmade peninsula known as Les Bains des Paquis.

You can swim in the lake, dine alfresco and mingle with locals, while absorbing stunning views at the same time, said Viquerat.

Where do you want to live?

The city, divided by the Rhone River, is split into the Left and Right Banks. The Old Town can be found on the Left Bank, which has plenty of bars and trendy restaurants, and is close to the luxury shops on La Rue Du Rhone, including the famous Swiss watch stores. The Right Banks lively Les Paquis neighbourhood, close to the main train station and also home to the red light district, has an always-lively nightlife and is more eclectic than its gentrified surroundings.

For a chilled-out vibe, Viquerat suggested Carouge, 3km south of the city. Youll find quite a few pubs, but the atmosphere is more relaxed, he said. Champel, 2km southeast of downtown, is a calmer and more residential option, popular with expats with families

What do you want to live in?

Almost all residents live in apartments. Most of the buildings are relatively old, with new buildings few and far between. While the more historic buildings in the Old Town and Eaux Vives neighbourhoods have a Swiss charm, with cobbled streets and 16th-century limestone houses, Geneva isn't known for its great architecture, explained Andras Barta, a Geneva resident and local expert for Your Local Cousin. Buildings are more functional than pretty, both inside and out.

Even so, residents cant afford to be picky. A shortage of housing options, especially affordable properties, means people often jump at the first available flat.

Where can you travel?

With Geneva Airport only 6km north of the city centre, its easy to travel nearly anywhere in Europe in just a few hours. EasyJet, one of Europes largest budget airlines, uses Geneva as a hub, making it affordable and quick to get to Amsterdam, London, Paris, Berlin, Rome and Barcelona.

The French cities of Lyon and Annecy, as well as Zurich and Basel in Switzerland, are easy day trips via Genevas excellent train infrastructure, all within three hours. In the winter, popular ski resorts like Megeve, Port du Soleil, Verbier and Zermatt are also easy to reach within a few hours.

How much does it cost?

According to a 2015 study by UBS, Geneva is the third most expensive city in the world, after New York and Zurich. But Geneva has also one of the highest pay scales, providing workers with great salaries and great benefits, Viquerat said.

Though not quite offsetting high rents and entertainment costs, local transportation is cheap, with a monthly public transport pass costing nearly half the price of a similar pass in New York City.

While eating out can be expensive, discount supermarkets have stabilized prices for those who prefer eating in. The recent arrival of German hard-discounters Lidl and Aldi helped drive prices down in Switzerland, Barta said. But it still can be hard for foreigners to get over the shock of a nine-euro pint of beer.

Mobile payment company Square beat earnings expectations in its first financial report as a public company.

Square reported quarterly revenues of $374m (262m) up from $250m in the fourth quarter of 2014.

The mobile payment system founded by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey - who currently runs both companies - went public in November.

Although net losses widened to $80.5m, from $37.1m, Square's shares rose more than 4% in after hours trading.

The company was founded in 2009, and is best known for its hardware used to accept credit card payments on mobile phones.

The company said it expects to be profitable by the end of the year.

The company saw growth in its costumer bases for its flagship payment processer as well as its lending, invoicing and deposits business.

The company's loan arm, Square Capital, lent $150m in the fourth quarter, but investors have questioned whether Square can stand up to competition from larger players in the financial industry such as Chase or Visa.

Mrs Reagan, who died of congestive heart failure in Los Angeles, was praised by President Barack Obama's family and other senior US politicians and foreign leaders.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Nancy Reagan was always her husband's strongest supporter

Like her husband, Mrs Reagan was a former Hollywood performer who made it all the way to the White House.

As Nancy Davis, she was an actress during the 1940s and 1950s and married Mr Reagan, a prominent film actor, in 1952.

She served as first lady of California during her husband's stint as California governor from 1967 to 1975 before moving into the White House after his decisive victory over Democrat President Jimmy Carter in 1980.

As first lady, she sought to emulate the style of one of her predecessors, Jackie Kennedy.

To this end, she extensively redecorated the White House, and accepted designer dresses worth $1m (703,000) and a 4,732-piece set of china worth $209,000.

But this spending spree provoked an outcry from some outraged by what they saw as profligacy and waste while millions of Americans were losing their jobs.

Public opinion was also swayed by accusations that Mrs Reagan had a frosty personality, often consulted astrologers, and ordered the dismissal of White House chief of staff Donald Regan in 1987.

""I see the first lady as another means to keep a president from becoming isolated,"" she once said.

Mrs Reagan's best-known project as first lady was the anti-drugs ""Just Say No"" campaign.

After her husband died of Alzheimer's disease in 2004, she became a champion for Alzheimer's patients, raising millions of dollars for research and breaking with fellow conservative Republicans to argue for stem cell research.",[]

Mobil otomatis tak bisa membuntuti, mendecitkan rem atau menyalip tiba-tiba mobil di depan. Mereka juga tak akan mengacungkan jari tengah untuk memaki-maki mobil swakendara lain.

8. Pencurian mobil

Kunci? Mobil swakendara akan dioperasikan lewat pemindai sidik jari dan retina mata. Juga dengan penyocok suara atau bahkan telepati buatan. Bahkan dengan model keamanan lingkungan, mungkin saja mobil swakendara akan berjalan sebelum pencuri sempat beraksi.

9. Melanggar hewan di jalan

Mereka akan sangat peduli pada lingkungan sekitar, dan punya refleks luar biasa. Tak akan ada hewan kecil tertabrak di tengah jalan.

bbc.com,,Vietnam twins found to have different fathers in rare case,[],"Image copyright iStock Image caption There are only a handful of known cases worldwide of heteropaternal superfecundation

A pair of Vietnamese fraternal twins have been confirmed to have different fathers, a local genetic association has told the BBC.

The twins had their DNA tested after their family noticed they looked different, said local reports.

The occurrence, known as heteropaternal superfecundation, is rare with few publicly known about.

It happens when a woman's eggs are fertilised by two men within a short period of time.

Professor Le Dinh Luong, president of the Hanoi-based Vietnam Genetic Association which did the DNA testing, said the results were ""100% correct"" in what he called ""an extremely rare case"".

""There are only less than 10 known cases of twins with different fathers in the world. There might be other cases but the parents and/or the twins were not aware of it or didn't want to announce it,"" he told the BBC's Nga Pham.

He declined to give further details citing client confidentiality, but added that local reports stating the twins' location, names and timeframe were inaccurate.

Vietnamese news outlets began reporting on the case earlier this month, saying that relatives had noticed that one of the twins looked markedly different from its sibling and parents.

What is heteropaternal superfecundation?

bbc.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,A crazy sport created by isolation,['Matt Maynard'],"A strong hand pushed my head under the watery kiea (clay) that stained the bathtub red. Id been searching for Rapa Nui for a long time  and it seemed that in this strange moment I had finally found it.

Easter Island, its Polynesian people and their language are all called Rapa Nui. Theyve lived on this remote island since at least the 12th Century, when they sculpted the first of its iconic Moai statues, all of which symbolically face inwards. Knowing this, Id always imagined the Rapa Nui to be a conservative culture, their dramatic isolation creating a society of unshakable traditional values. But when I saw a photo of a Rapa Nui tobogganing down the grass slope of a volcano on a banana-tree trunk, it left me wondering: what does it mean to be an islander today?

I arrived in Hanga Roa, Rapa Nuis only town, for the two-week festival of Tapati, a contest of dance, drama, cookery, song and sport that takes place at the start of each February. Tapati is organised for the Rapa Nui, by the Rapa Nui, largely in the language of Rapa Nui  reflecting the fiercely independent nature of this culture that for 500 years believed they were the only people left on Earth. Headlining the festival were feats of warlike bravery  perhaps an echo of the islands rediscovery on Easter Day 1722 and the turbulent history with outsiders that followed.

They believed they were the only people left on Earth.

But at the first contest  the triathlon  I discovered a rather less ferocious item of Rapa Nui identity: the hami (thong). Men wear the hami and little else during festival activities, often adorned with colourful shells. To find each event, I frequently just followed these scantily clad, perfectly tanned bottoms across the length and breadth of the 160sqkm island.

The Haka Pei, or the banana tree-trunk toboggan run, was easy to find. When your nearest neighbours are more than 2,000km away, it's amazing where a strong imagination, a banana tree sledge, a steep grass slope and a razor-thin hami can lead. The Haka Pei is probably the wildest thing you can do with your clothes (barely) on.

With drums beating and crowds roaring, the whole island seemed to be in attendance. I watched the competitors on the summit of the Maunga Pu volcano solemnly join hands.

Look at Ata, my host Kau Tepano said, pointing at a young competitor. Thick with body paint, tight with tensed muscles and dressed in only his hami, 18-year-old Ata looked like a warrior. He is here for his mother, Tepano explained. She recently passed away.

Through chanting, prayer and a bite from a shared chicken leg, competitors began to commune with their ancestors. Despite the competitive atmosphere, this is actually the most important part of the day, Tepano said.

As the Rapa Nui lifted their toboggans made of two banana tree-trunks lashed together to the lip of the descent, some of their faces were fixed in ecstasy, others in fear, and a few, like Atas shining with pride. The teammates pushed Atas toboggan until they could no longer keep up, and then left him to accelerate downhill, lying feet first on the precarious contraption until he became an 80km-per-hour blur of grass and flesh and wood. Although he didnt win, he arrived at the foot of the volcano safely and leapt from his toboggan in joy at being alive, his communion with his recently departed ancestor complete.

Some of their faces were fixed in ecstasy, others in fear.

But Tapati was not all adrenaline and warlike ceremony. Despite the Rapa Nuis veneration of athletic prowess, those strong men in hamis would sometimes surprise me, participating in a Kakaka competition where they would patiently beat banana bark for hours until it turned into parchment. Or competing alongside the women, using banana leaves to cook curanto (a dish of slow-cooked sweet potato and meat) in an underground oven.

My appreciation of the Rapa Nuis softer side took an even more unexpected turn at the Crown of Flowers competition. In the shade of a cool marquee, some 100,000 petals lay scattered and 12 young women sat threading 12 rainbows through lattices of shredded banana leaves. The crafting of the crowns was overseen by an elderly matriarch who picked her petals with long, thin, deliberate fingers.

Is she your grandmother? I whispered to the girl closest to her. She is grandma to all of us, she said, and then, with reverence, She is ancestral.

After two hours work, just before the crowns were laid out for the judges to award their points, I was surprised by the sound of a deep male voice asking me: How do I look?

I turned and noticed that I had overlooked the muscular arms and shaded upper lip of this crowned competitor in a dress. Spectacular, I said with honesty, if a little taken aback. Maybe it was the extreme heat, or the bedazzling flowers but I was surprised, and pleased, to understand that Rapa Nui society had space for Poma Hina to fit in.

The festival is essential for helping the Rapa Nui connect with their past, their present and with themselves, and never was this more apparent than at the climactic Farandula parade, the carnival where both visitors and Rapa Nui take to the streets in full body paint and costume. Floats of dancers, drummers and carnival divas passed down the Atuma Tekena main street with judges scoring every competitor.

I found myself at the parade preparation in my underpants.

And so it was that I found myself at the parade preparation in my underpants (I drew the line at the hami), surrounded by about 500 men and women naked from the waist up, my head being pushed into a bathtub filled with a thick soup of red body paint.

When I came up for air, I realised that this invitation to participate was the most wonderful experience of the festival so far. As if reading my thoughts, the body painter wiped the red water from my forehead, and whispered in my ear: Thank you for sharing in our culture.

This was Rapa Nui. A sense of what it felt to belong.

Iran telah meluncurkan dua rudal balistik sebagai bagian dari latihan militer, dua bulan setelah Amerika Serikat menerapkan sanksi terhadap Iran atas uji rudal serupa.

Sebagaimana dilaporkan stasiun televisi Iran, Press TV, dua rudal bernama Qadr H dan Qadr F telah diluncurkan Garda Revolusi di bagian utara dan mengenai target di bagian tenggara Iran sejauh 1.400 kilometer.

Pada bagian luar roket, menurut kantor berita Fars, terdapat tulisan berbunyi Israel harus diratakan.

Rudal-rudal yang ditembakkan hari ini (Rabu, 9 Maret 2016) adalah hasil dari rangkaian sanksi. Sanksi-sanksi itu membuat Iran mengembangkan program rudal, kata Brigadir Jenderal Hossein Salami, wakil komandan Garda Revolusi, seperti dikutip Fars.

Image copyright ISB Image caption Aksi peluncuran rudal berjarak dua bulan setelah AS menerapkan sanksi terhadap Iran atas aksi serupa.

Kendati bisa memuat hulu ledak nuklir, rudal-rudal yang dimiliki Iran diklaim hanya untuk kepentingan penggentar konvensional. Di antara sejumlah rudal, ada yang mampu menjangkau target sejauh 2.000 kilometer sehingga secara teori sanggup mencapai Israel dan pangkalan militer AS di Timur Tengah.

Aksi peluncuran rudal itu berjarak dua bulan setelah Departemen Keuangan Amerika Serikat menerapkan sanksi terhadap Iran terkait uji coba rudal balistik.

Kini, setelah Iran kembali meluncurkan rudalnya, sejumlah pejabat AS mengatakan akan mengadukan peluncuran rudal tersebut ke Dewan Keamanan PBB.

Beberapa pakar PBB memandang uji coba itu telah melanggar resolusi Dewan Keamanan PBB.

Resolusi 1929 melarang Iran mengembangkan rudal balistik yang mampu mengangkut hulu ledak nuklir. Namun, resolusi ini dihapus setelah kesepakatan nuklir antara Iran dan enam kekuatan dunia diterapkan dua bulan lalu.

Sebagai ganti, resolusi 2231 diberlakukan. Resolusi ini menyeru kepada Iran untuk tidak melakukan aktivitas peluncuran rudal.",[]

bbc.com,,"Ray Tomlinson's email is flawed, but never bettered","['North America Technology Reporter', 'Dave Lee']","Image copyright AP Image caption Ray Tomlinson is credited with inventing emails in 1971

The internet pioneer Ray Tomlinson has died, aged 74.

He is widely regarded as the inventor of email, and is credited with putting the now iconic ""@"" sign in the addresses of the revolutionary system.

He could never have imagined the multitude of ways email would come to be used, abused and confused.

Just think - right now, someone, somewhere is writing an email she should probably reconsider. Count to 10, my friend. Sleep on it.

Another is sending an email containing brutal, heartbreaking words that, really, should be said in person... if only he had the nerve.

And of course, a Nigerian prince is considering how best to ask for my help in spending his fortune.

Email does curious things to us. We worry about getting emails, we worry about not getting emails.

Before joining the BBC, I'd live by the popular freelancer's mantra that a watched inbox never fills, so I'd go for a walk in the hope of returning to offers of work.

Image copyright Thinkstock

Now I'm desperate for ""inbox zero"".

Email became part of everyday life so quickly we didn't have enough time to learn how to properly use it - until there was no turning back, and bad habits were set in stone.

To make things worse, the Blackberry brought email away from our computers and into our palms - and therefore our bedrooms, our commutes and our toilet breaks.

In doing so, we willingly let email seep into our lives, instigating an anxiety we'd not yet encountered. One study in 2014 took email away from 13 US government workers. The result? Their average heart-rates decreased.

And that's because for anyone with any kind of office job, the temptation - or perhaps pressure - to be on top of your emails can be overwhelming.

In France, there have even been calls to enforce some kind of ""digital work hour"" restriction, because checking your email after work is, after all, free labour.

The first email

Below is an extract from Ray Tomlinson's account of how he created email:

I am frequently asked why I chose the at sign, but the at sign just makes sense.

The purpose of the at sign (in English) was to indicate a unit price (for example, 10 items @ $1.95). I used the at sign to indicate that the user was ""at"" some other host rather than being local.

The first message was sent between two machines that were literally side by side. The only physical connection they had (aside from the floor they sat on) was through the Arpanet.

I sent a number of test messages to myself from one machine to the other. The test messages were entirely forgettable and I have, therefore, forgotten them.

Most likely the first message was QWERTYUIOP or something similar. When I was satisfied that the program seemed to work, I sent a message to the rest of my group explaining how to send messages over the network.

The first use of network email announced its own existence.

'Completely forgettable'

Yet, for all its faults, we've still not found anything better.

Which is why, as the technology world mourns the loss of Ray Tomlinson, it's only right to spend a moment to appreciate what a remarkable contribution he made to the business of communication.

He's credited as sending the first email as we know it today - and commandeering the @ symbol as a way to simplify how it works.

The first messages were sent between computers that were a mere 10 feet apart, but the feat was enormous.

For something so groundbreaking, it was adorably anti-climactic. Just read how he described it during an interview in 2009.

Image copyright Slack Image caption Sites like Slack want to replace emails - even if just internally

""Every time you test you have to generate some sort of message.

""You might drag your fingers across the keyboard or just type the opening phrase from Lincoln's Gettysburg address or something else - so technically the first email is completely forgettable and therefore forgotten.""

In the following decades, the @ sign has gone from being a barely-used character to one we use multiple times a day. As NPR put it, Mr Tomlinson changed @ from a symbol into an icon.

Yes there's spam. Yes there's phishing attacks. Yes there's work mailing lists that ding constantly, or ""reply all"" fiascos.

But email itself has never been the problem, just the people that use it.

Post-email

That said, one hopes email is replaced one day. It's widely accepted that it's not an efficient communication method, and disrupts the focus of anyone trying to get things done.

But what could possibly come next?

Image copyright Facebook Image caption Facebook At Work is being trialled by several companies - but could be broadened out soon

In the past year we've seen companies like Slack try and reinvent workplace communication, but while such tools are great for chatting internally, it does little to improve talking to those who work outside of your company.

In its quest for world domination, Facebook has long wanted us to ditch using email and instead shift over to using the Facebook inbox.

But I don't know about you, my Facebook inbox is one of the few safe spaces I have on the internet: an area where work does not overflow into my personal life. I'd like to keep it that way.

Soon, we're expecting Facebook will expand its Facebook At Work service, offering it to all businesses around the world. It's being trialled by a selection of firms, including the likes of RBS and Heineken. The idea is that communication tools we're all familiar with when talking to our friends can surely help us chat at work. Minus the cat videos.

If Facebook provides a way to separate work life from personal life, then great. Like Slack, it seems to work best when talking to people you already work with. If the rest of it just becomes a place to send and receive messages in chronological order... that's just an email inbox in disguise.

And we're back to where Ray Tomlinson started in 1971. 1971! This is an industry that moves quicker than any other, where start-ups come and go in a matter of weeks.

And yet Mr Tomlinson's innovation has endured for 45 years - and shows no sign of going anywhere yet.

Son aproximadamente 5,4 millones de mexicanos los que viven de forma legal en Estados Unidos y podrian votar en las proximas elecciones, sin embargo, casi dos tercios no podran hacerlo porque todavia no han solicitado la nacionalidad.

Brandt senala que en un reciente estudio revelo que el 16% de los que cumplen con los requisitos nunca han recibido informacion al respecto.

La falta de habilidad con el idioma, el temor a suspender el examen de ciudadania que hay que aprobar como parte del proceso y el dinero que se debe pagar son las principales dificultades que afrontan los inmigrantes.

Y es que solo el 36% de los mexicanos que pueden optar a la nacionalidad lo hacen, mientras que el promedio general es del 68% y en el caso de otros grupos, como los cubanos, llega al 72%.

Miedo al ingles

Ana Gonzalez-Barerra investigadora del Centro de Investigaciones Pew explico a BBC Mundo que ""sobre todo para los mexicanos la principal barrera es la del lenguaje"".

La investigadora esta actualizando un estudio que analizo este fenomeno y en el que revelo que un tercio de los mexicanos consultados alego el poco conocimiento de ingles para no optar a la ciudadania.

El motivo mas comun fue la falta de interes, seguido del financiero, puesto que el costo estimado del proceso asciende a $US680 dolares.

En conjunto en America las tasas mas altas las tienen los paises del Caribe de habla inglesa, como Jamaica, con el 80% y entre los de habla hispana Cuba, con 72%.

Segun The New York Times, se espera que cerca de un millon de personas adquiera la ciudania en 2016, lo que es 200.000 mas que el promedio de anos anteriores. Este aumento es normal en anos electorales, aunque el diario sugiere que entre hispanos puede deberse al efecto de la candidatura de Donald Trump.

bbc.com,,"Rhino poaching: Another year, another grim record","['David Shukman', 'Science Editor']","Image copyright AP Image caption There are thought to be only around 25,000 rhinos left worldwide, most of them in South Africa

The mass slaughter of rhinos has increased for the sixth year in a row, according to grim new figures from international researchers.

At least 1,338 of the iconic animals were killed for their horns in Africa last year.

This is the greatest loss in a single year since an intense wave of poaching began recently.

Since 2008, as many as 5,940 rhinos have been killed although scientists fear that could be an underestimate.

The findings were compiled by researchers from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

The losses come despite a drive to fight poaching gangs by strengthening patrols, harnessing satellite technology and boosting intelligence-gathering.

The IUCN blames continuing demand from South East Asia - where rhino horn is wrongly believed to have medicinal properties - fed by increasingly sophisticated international crime networks.

'Nowhere is safe'

Officials say that amid the killings there are some helpful developments.

Overall, the rate of increase in poaching has fallen slightly and in South Africa, home to the greatest number of rhinos, the numbers killed in a single year fell slightly for the first time since 2008.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Ground-up rhino horn is seen by many in Vietnam as a miracle cure-all

Dr Richard Emslie, of the IUCN's African Rhino Specialist Group, told the BBC:

""Any increase in poaching is alarming but there are some positives. When poaching started to escalate in 2008, we saw year after year of exponentially increasingly poaching.

""But over the last couple of years we've seen a decline in the rate of increase.""

Dr Emslie described this as ""an encouraging trend"" and he highlighted how South Africa has managed to reduce the number of rhinos slaughtered from 1,215 in 2014 to 1,175 last year.

But success in one area can lead to further poaching elsewhere and while South Africa can point to a slightly improved picture, other countries have seen sharp increases in losses.

According to the new data, the number of rhinos killed in Namibia has quadrupled in just the last two years while losses in Zimbabwe doubled over the same period.

No rhinos in the wild

Dr Emslie described the fight against poaching as like squeezing a balloon.

""If you clamp down on poaching on the one side of the Kruger National Park beside the Mozambique border, then suddenly the balloon pops out a bit the other side and you can get more poaching.

Image copyright AFP Image caption In some places dogs are specially trained to sniff out rhino horn and ivory in passenger luggage

""There's a trend of poaching from different park to different park and also from one country to another so no individual country is safe and all need to be on their guard given the huge threat.""

Commenting on the latest figures, Craig Bruce, a rhino specialist at the Zoological Society of London, said: ""I think it's a dire situation and despite reports of a decrease in the Kruger National Park, I don't think it's a cause for celebration.

""If we continue with the current rate of losses, then I would estimate that within five to 10 years, all we will have is rhinos in very strictly controlled captivity scenarios and we will basically have lost the species in the wild.""

After a previous collapse in rhino numbers during the 1960s, a concerted effort which was backed by determined governments and generous funding saw populations restored.

Unprecedented aggression

But this crisis is seen as more serious and therefore harder to tackle because of the sheer aggression and growing sophistication of the poaching gangs, fuelled by the high price for rhino horn on the black market.

Mr Bruce told me that every new technological advance designed to help the conservation effort - including drones, radios and intelligence-gathering - is matched by the poachers.

The illegal rhino trade

Wildlife crime is the fourth largest global illegal trade, according to WWF, after drugs, counterfeiting, and human trafficking

Rhino horn is one of the world's most expensive commodities, fetching about $60,000 (40,500) per kilo - it is worth more by weight than gold or diamonds

Poaching is by no means restricted to South Africa, home to the world's largest population of rhinos - it is also a threat to smaller rhino populations elsewhere eg in Asia

Four proposals to save the rhino

""What's frightening is that the same technology that we are able to use, they are also able to use. Shockingly, as much as we're using them to combat the poachers, they're using them to facilitate their poaching.

""They understand intelligence as well as we do. They understand how to threaten people to get information, how to threaten people to keep them quiet so the whole criminal element has just advanced in a way that's unprecedented.""

The latest data will reignite long-running debates over the best way to stem the losses.

Ideas range from cutting off the rhinos' horns in order to deny poachers and to flood the market with cheap horn to fitting monitoring devices or even cameras to the animals to help provide warning of attacks.

With the global total of rhinos now only in the region of 25,000, there will be renewed attention in the approach to a major international meeting of the CITES convention, set up to combat the illegal trade in endangered species, in Johannesburg in September.

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,La artista argentina de Instagram que engano a miles de personas,"['University College London', 'Cadence Kinsey']","Image copyright Amalia Ulman y Arcadia Missa Image caption Amalia Ulman creo un personaje en linea y lo utilizo en Instagram para hacer preguntas sobre el genero en linea.

Entre abril y septiembre de 2014, la artista de origen argentino Amalia Ulman se presento a si misma como una ""Chica Instagram"".

Utilizando hashtags populares de micro-celebridades en la popular red social, Ulman creo una obra de tres partes que explora como las mujeres se presentan en linea.

Titulado ""Excelencias y perfecciones"", el proyecto vio a Ulman asumir el papel de cute girl (chica bonita), sugar baby (joven mantenida por su amante) y life goddess (diosa de la vida).

Ulman dijo que eligio estos personajes porque, para las mujeres, ""parecian ser las tendencias mas populares en linea"".

Organizando los personajes en ""un orden que podria tener sentido como una narrativa"", Amalia se traslado a la gran ciudad, rompio con su novio de mucho tiempo, consumio drogas, se sometio a cirugia plastica, se autodestruyo, se disculpo, se recupero y encontro un nuevo novio.

Para el final del proyecto en 19 de septiembre de 2014, Ulman habia acumulado 88.906 seguidores (la cuenta cuenta ahora con mas de 110.000). Fue solo entonces cuando se revelo que todo habia sido una actuacion, una obra de arte, en lugar de un registro de la vida real.

Presentados simultaneamente en dos grandes exposiciones en Londres, Electronic Superhighway en la galeria Whitechapel y Performing for the Camera en la Tate Modern, ""Excelencias y perfecciones"" ha recibido una gran atencion por su manipulacion de las plataformas de medios sociales y su reproduccion de los estereotipos de genero.

El diario The Telegraph se pregunto: ""Es esta la primera obra maestra de Instagram?"", mientras que Slate la describio como ""una sensacion del mundo del arte"".

En el corazon de la obra esta la relacion entre la identidad en linea y fuera de linea.

Como Ulman dijo al critico de arte Alastair Sooke, cuando por primera vez comenzo a publicar: ""La gente empezo a odiarme. Algunas galerias donde estaba exhibiendo se asustaron y me decian cosas como, 'Usted tiene que dejar de hacer esto, porque la gente no la tomara en serio nunca mas'"".

Image copyright Amalia UlmanArcadia Missa Image caption Amalia Ulman esplora la ""cute girl"" en su obra.

Frecuentemente descrito como una ""broma"", el proyecto de Ulman atrajo criticas por parte de los usuarios de Facebook e Instagram.

La revelacion fue una sorpresa para muchos usuarios debido a que Ulman se habia asegurado de que las entradas encajarian con su habitual produccion en los medios de comunicacion social, al menos inicialmente.

Manteniendo apariencias

La autenticidad es una idea central en la cultura de los medios sociales, con frases familiares para la mayoria de los usuarios tales como ""ser uno mismo"" y ""haz lo que amas"".

Estos ideales se ven reforzadas por la tecnologia, ya que las plataformas de medios sociales ahora generalmente requieren o al menos alientan el uso de nombres reales y una sola identidad en los perfiles.

Esto contrasta con los principios de la web, que ofrecia mayores oportunidades para el anonimato.

Como el antropologo Daniel Miller senala, ""internet aparecio inicialmente para ampliar el campo del anonimato, lo que significaba que la gente podia explorar nuevas formas de identidad, cambiar de identidad o asegurar multiples identidades con relativa libertad"".

""Por el contrario, Facebook se ha asociado no solo con la perdida del anonimato, sino como una amenaza para todos los aspectos de la vida privada"", agrega.

Sin embargo, a pesar de lo mucho que se promueve la autenticidad en las redes sociales, todavia sabemos que los perfiles son manipulados en un grado u otro.

Esto plantea preguntas acerca de como esperamos que se vea el arte y lo que esperamos que haga el arte.

""Excelencias y perfecciones"" ha molestado a algunos por la forma en que reproduce imagenes estereotipadas de la mujer.

Como una obra de arte feminista, es marcadamente diferente de las de las ciberfeministas de la decada de 1990, que utilizaron la web para explorar identidades ambiguas.

En su lugar, inspirado en la crisis publica de celebridades femeninas como Amanda Bynes, ""Excelencias y perfecciones"" replica una narrativa de ruptura, disculpa y salvacion que alimenta una economia de gustos y acciones.

Como Ulman ha declarado, ""cuanto mas triste es la nina, mas feliz es el gnomo"".

Image copyright Amalia UlmanArcadia Missa Image caption En ""sugar baby"", Ulman explora un lado mas oscuro de su personaje.

""Excelencias y perfecciones"" establece el concepto de genero como una actuacion en el contexto especifico de la forma en la que recompensamos y valoramos imagenes de la mujer en linea.

El proyecto se sentia creible porque era familiar.

Basandose en un personaje y una narrativa que se habia visto antes permitio a la ""gente mapear el contenido con facilidad"".

Cuanto mas actua alguien de acuerdo a los comportamientos prescritos, mas ""me gusta"" y ""compartir"" reciben.

Identidad desplegable

Recompensar el comportamiento de esta manera es fundamental para el modelo de negocio de las redes sociales.

La web de hoy hace de embudo de nuestras oportunidades para la auto-representacion a traves de las plantillas cada vez mas estandarizadas (basta pensar en las opciones de personalizacion en un sitio como MySpace en comparacion con Facebook), y con frecuencia convierte aspectos de nuestra identidad en una sola categoria en un menu desplegable.

Image copyright Amalia UlmanArcadia Missa Image caption En la ultima parte, Ulman reaparece como una ""life goddess"".

Sitios como Facebook e Instagram se basan en la venta de informacion acerca de sus usuarios y los menus desplegables son mecanismos importantes para mejorar la captura de datos.

Como argumento en 2013 Jose van Dijck, profesor de estudios de Medios Comparativos de la Universidad de Amsterdam, ""la normalizacion de los datos de entrada garantiza mejores resultados"".

Lejos de ser un lugar para escapar de las narrativas tradicionales, comportamientos y formas de expresion, la web con frecuencia los reproduce.

Este es un importante recordatorio de que la red no es un reino ""virtual"", separado del mundo cotidiano.

Aunque esta no es la primera vez que Ulman ha explorado la forma en que ciertas imagenes ganan popularidad en linea (su ensayo de 2012 f/f, analizo los sitios de redes sociales de Latinoamerica Fotocumbia y Fotolog), ""Excelencias y perfecciones"" tambien presenta una reflexion aguda de su propio papel como la artista ingenua.

En el lanzamiento del proyecto como parte del programa New Museum New York's First Look Program en octubre de 2014, Ulman pregunto: ""Que apariencia se supone que tiene una artista femenina? Como se supone que tiene que comportarse? El precio de las obras de arte crecen en relacion con tu apariencia"".

Teniendo en cuenta el interes mundial en este trabajo, la obra muestra que poca diferencia hay entre como el poder, el privilegio y el prestigio se construyen en las redes en linea de los medios sociales y en el mundo del arte.",[]

bbc.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,A crazy sport created by isolation,['Matt Maynard'],"A strong hand pushed my head under the watery kiea (clay) that stained the bathtub red. Id been searching for Rapa Nui for a long time  and it seemed that in this strange moment I had finally found it.

Easter Island, its Polynesian people and their language are all called Rapa Nui. Theyve lived on this remote island since at least the 12th Century, when they sculpted the first of its iconic Moai statues, all of which symbolically face inwards. Knowing this, Id always imagined the Rapa Nui to be a conservative culture, their dramatic isolation creating a society of unshakable traditional values. But when I saw a photo of a Rapa Nui tobogganing down the grass slope of a volcano on a banana-tree trunk, it left me wondering: what does it mean to be an islander today?

I arrived in Hanga Roa, Rapa Nuis only town, for the two-week festival of Tapati, a contest of dance, drama, cookery, song and sport that takes place at the start of each February. Tapati is organised for the Rapa Nui, by the Rapa Nui, largely in the language of Rapa Nui  reflecting the fiercely independent nature of this culture that for 500 years believed they were the only people left on Earth. Headlining the festival were feats of warlike bravery  perhaps an echo of the islands rediscovery on Easter Day 1722 and the turbulent history with outsiders that followed.

They believed they were the only people left on Earth.

But at the first contest  the triathlon  I discovered a rather less ferocious item of Rapa Nui identity: the hami (thong). Men wear the hami and little else during festival activities, often adorned with colourful shells. To find each event, I frequently just followed these scantily clad, perfectly tanned bottoms across the length and breadth of the 160sqkm island.

The Haka Pei, or the banana tree-trunk toboggan run, was easy to find. When your nearest neighbours are more than 2,000km away, it's amazing where a strong imagination, a banana tree sledge, a steep grass slope and a razor-thin hami can lead. The Haka Pei is probably the wildest thing you can do with your clothes (barely) on.

With drums beating and crowds roaring, the whole island seemed to be in attendance. I watched the competitors on the summit of the Maunga Pu volcano solemnly join hands.

Look at Ata, my host Kau Tepano said, pointing at a young competitor. Thick with body paint, tight with tensed muscles and dressed in only his hami, 18-year-old Ata looked like a warrior. He is here for his mother, Tepano explained. She recently passed away.

Through chanting, prayer and a bite from a shared chicken leg, competitors began to commune with their ancestors. Despite the competitive atmosphere, this is actually the most important part of the day, Tepano said.

As the Rapa Nui lifted their toboggans made of two banana tree-trunks lashed together to the lip of the descent, some of their faces were fixed in ecstasy, others in fear, and a few, like Atas shining with pride. The teammates pushed Atas toboggan until they could no longer keep up, and then left him to accelerate downhill, lying feet first on the precarious contraption until he became an 80km-per-hour blur of grass and flesh and wood. Although he didnt win, he arrived at the foot of the volcano safely and leapt from his toboggan in joy at being alive, his communion with his recently departed ancestor complete.

Some of their faces were fixed in ecstasy, others in fear.

But Tapati was not all adrenaline and warlike ceremony. Despite the Rapa Nuis veneration of athletic prowess, those strong men in hamis would sometimes surprise me, participating in a Kakaka competition where they would patiently beat banana bark for hours until it turned into parchment. Or competing alongside the women, using banana leaves to cook curanto (a dish of slow-cooked sweet potato and meat) in an underground oven.

My appreciation of the Rapa Nuis softer side took an even more unexpected turn at the Crown of Flowers competition. In the shade of a cool marquee, some 100,000 petals lay scattered and 12 young women sat threading 12 rainbows through lattices of shredded banana leaves. The crafting of the crowns was overseen by an elderly matriarch who picked her petals with long, thin, deliberate fingers.

Is she your grandmother? I whispered to the girl closest to her. She is grandma to all of us, she said, and then, with reverence, She is ancestral.

After two hours work, just before the crowns were laid out for the judges to award their points, I was surprised by the sound of a deep male voice asking me: How do I look?

I turned and noticed that I had overlooked the muscular arms and shaded upper lip of this crowned competitor in a dress. Spectacular, I said with honesty, if a little taken aback. Maybe it was the extreme heat, or the bedazzling flowers but I was surprised, and pleased, to understand that Rapa Nui society had space for Poma Hina to fit in.

The festival is essential for helping the Rapa Nui connect with their past, their present and with themselves, and never was this more apparent than at the climactic Farandula parade, the carnival where both visitors and Rapa Nui take to the streets in full body paint and costume. Floats of dancers, drummers and carnival divas passed down the Atuma Tekena main street with judges scoring every competitor.

I found myself at the parade preparation in my underpants.

And so it was that I found myself at the parade preparation in my underpants (I drew the line at the hami), surrounded by about 500 men and women naked from the waist up, my head being pushed into a bathtub filled with a thick soup of red body paint.

When I came up for air, I realised that this invitation to participate was the most wonderful experience of the festival so far. As if reading my thoughts, the body painter wiped the red water from my forehead, and whispered in my ear: Thank you for sharing in our culture.

This was Rapa Nui. A sense of what it felt to belong.

bbc.com,,Sunday trading defeat for government as MPs reject changes,[],"Media caption The moment MPs rejected changes to Sunday trading laws

Plans to overhaul Sunday trading laws in England and Wales have been dropped after they were rejected by MPs.

The Commons opposed proposals to allow councils to extend opening hours by 317 votes to 286, as 27 Tories rebelled.

Ministers had sought to limit the rebellion by promising to trial the changes in 12 areas but said afterwards they would respect MPs' views.

Critics of the plans said they would ""chip away"" at Sunday's special status and put undue pressure on workers.

It is the Conservative government's second defeat in the House of Commons since it was elected last May.

'Tawdry'

The government had hoped to relax existing restrictions on Sunday trading, which limit large shops to opening for a maximum of six hours, by devolving responsibility to local councils. But their plans were thwarted by an unlikely alliance of Labour, the SNP and Conservative backbenchers.

Before the vote, ministers indicated they would seek to amend their proposals in the House of Lords if MPs approved them in principle. But while blaming the SNP for the defeat, ministers conceded afterwards the plans would not be resurrected.

""We respect the view of the House of Parliament. The Commons has spoken and given a very clear view - we have to absolutely respect that,"" said the planning minister Brandon Lewis.

'Dead hand'

In the biggest proposed shake-up for 20 years, ministers wanted to give the 353 councils in England and 22 in Wales the freedom to determine opening hours for large shops in their area.

During a three-hour debate, a succession of Conservative MPs spoke out against the changes - first announced by Mr Osborne in last year's Budget - and the way they were being introduced.

Analysis by the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg

The reason the government lost by such a margin was not just because of staunch opposition from the Labour Party with its 'Keep Sunday Special' campaign, or the principled opposition from many Tory MPs who believe fervently that Sundays are indeed special and should be protected.

The government also lost because the SNP objected to their plans, even though in Scotland shops have opened for longer on Sundays for many years.

It is an embarrassing defeat for the government and particularly George Osborne, who must deliver the Budget a week today. But the SNP's involvement could have a longer term impact. Read more from Laura

Sir Gerald Howarth said the late offer of concessions had been ""shambolic"" and looked like they had been ""delivered by lastminute.com"" while Stewart Jackson said the ""dead hand"" of the Treasury was responsible for an ""egregious and unnecessary confrontation"" with Tory backbenchers.

Conservative MP David Burrowes, who tabled the successful rebel amendment, said the government had not made the economic case for such sweeping changes, which he said were opposed by businesses of all sizes, shop workers and faith groups.

Speaking after the vote, he told BBC News of his ""relief"", adding: ""The main thing out there is relief for shop workers, families and businesses who will really be pleased today.""

Labour said the government's approach had been ""tawdry"" and the House of Commons had spoken clearly on the ""contentious issue"".

The Federation of Small Businesses said the outcome was a ""major win"" for its members.

""Our members have been unconvinced of the economic case for relaxing Sunday trading rules and there has been no impact assessment to support the proposals,"" said the group's policy director, Mike Cherry.

""The current system can be seen as a great British compromise which allows families to spend time together, employees to work if they wish to, and provides much needed support for smaller retailers within their communities.""

The proposed changes were not covered by new English Votes for English Laws provisions, which require the explicit consent of English and Welsh MPs for measures exclusively affecting them, because other parts of the Enterprise Bill apply to Scotland.",[]

bbc.com,,BBC News on connected TV,[],"The BBC's News application for connected TV brings the latest news reports to your TV screen, on demand.

The service is started, stopped, and navigated via the remote control.

It has been designed as a complement to the BBC's live 24-hour news channel, and is updated around the clock with the latest video reports from around the world.

Users can also access full-length text articles from the BBC News website.

Accessing the service

Viewers can press the red button on any BBC channel to access the application. A BBC ""bridge"" appears, allowing you to choose between the iPlayer, News or Sport apps by pressing Up/Down, then OK.

This application is different from those available on the old Red Button service. Users are still provided with the latest news, but with a greater wealth of video content and longer text articles.

The BBC will continue to develop this application, adding new features and more content over the coming months and years.

Using the service

The main feature of the service is News in video - browse the videos and watch the ones that interest you most, or watch the videos one after the other, providing you with a News bulletin which is always up to date and available when you want to watch.

On entering the service, the viewer will first see a BBC News logo, with sound. They will then see a buffering prompt and the top story will begin playing.

When the first story begins playing, an info bar appears at the bottom of the screen which shows the headline of the story, the duration and the time at which it was published. After a short period the headline disappears, to be replaced with a short summary of the video. After another short period, the info panel disappears.

The info panel can be brought back on screen by pressing Up, Down, Left, Right, OK, Play or Pause. Viewers can press Left/Right/OK when the info panel is on screen to move to another story. At the end of each video report, the next report will autoplay immediately after.

When the info panel is on screen, viewers can press Up on the remote to show what videos are available. These appear in the form of a horizontal playlist. Viewers can move through the carousel and select a new story to watch with Left/Right/OK.

Should viewers want to read text articles they can press Up again from here to see a list of categories. These can be navigated/selected with Up/Down/OK.

When viewers choose a category the carousel will be updated with text content.

When viewers choose an article it will be displayed in the foreground while video continues to play in the background. A smaller info panel on the right shows information about the content shown in the video layer.

Viewers can exit the application by pressing Home, or pressing Back when only the info panel and the video report are shown on screen.

The service and remote controls

The application is entirely controlled with Up/Down/Left/Right/OK and Back.

Colour buttons and number keys have no function within the app.

No es que el mundo gire al reves, sino que la sombra de la Luna empezo a proyectarse primero sobre zonas del Pacifico, especialmente en el oeste de Indonesia, el miercoles en la manana y luego cruzo la linea internacional de cambio de fecha, la franja imaginaria que coincide con el meridiano 180, donde aun era martes.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Los ciudadanos de algunas partes de Indonesia fueron los afortunados que esta vez pudieron apreciar plenamente este fenomeno.

En cualquier caso, se trato de un eclipse solar total, un fenomeno astronomico que no ocurre a menudo.

El mas reciente se produjo en marzo de 2015 y, antes de eso, hubo uno en noviembre de 2012.

Image copyright Image caption Este mapa muestra el recorrido del eclipse solar, que fue desde el occidente hacia oriente.

Los ciudadanos de algunas partes de Indonesia fueron los afortunados que esta vez pudieron apreciar plenamente este fenomeno que ocurre cuando la Luna se interpone entre la Tierra y el Sol.

Eso hace que el Sol proyecte una franja de sombra de entre 100 y 150 kilometros de ancho sobre la superficie terrestre.

Image copyright EPA Image caption El eclipse solar parcial visto desde Myanmar, al sur de Asia.

Es ahi cuando se puede apreciar desde la Tierra la llamada corona solar, que luce como una suerte de llamaradas que parecen salir por detras de la Luna.

En regiones de Australia, del sur de China y del sureste de Asia, asi como en Hawai y Alaska tambien se vio un eclipse parcial de sol, durante el cual parecio como si a una parte de ese astro le faltara un trozo.

Image copyright AP Image caption Asi fue visto el eclipse de sol de 2012 en Queensland, Australia.

Segun la Agencia Espacial de Estados Unidos (NASA, por sus siglas en ingles), el eclipse debia durar unas tres horas en total, aunque dependia de la ubicacion desde la cual se estaba observando.

De igual modo, los lugares donde se aprecio el eclipse total quedaron completamente a oscuras entre 90 segundos y 4 minutos.

Quienes no se encontraban en ninguna de las regiones donde pudo apreciarse el eclipse, tenian la posibilidad de conectarse a la pagina web de la NASA, donde se hizo una transmision en directo del fenomeno, visto desde Micronesia.

Una oportunidad para la ciencia

Investigadores de la Agencia Espacial estadounidense dijeron que pensaban aprovechar el eclipse para estudiar la fisica del Sol.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Una estudiante prueba un filtro de luz solar hecho para poder apreciar el eclipse con seguridad.

Desde Indonesia emplearon un instrumento llamado camara de polarizacion para captar 59 exposiciones del Sol en el lapso de tres minutos, para recopilar informacion sobre la parte interior de la volatil y superardiente atmosfera solar.

Esa zona solo puede ser vista durante los eclipses totales de Sol, cuando la superficie brillante de ese astro esta completamente bloqueada por la Luna.

Los expertos consideran que la parte mas baja de la atmosfera del Sol, la corona, contiene la clave de varios misterios, incluyendo el relacionado con el nacimiento de nubes explosivas de material solar conocidas como eyeccion de masa coronal, asi como el referido a por que la corona es mas caliente que la superficie solar.

A noticia do descobrimento do cadaver foi reproduzida pela imprensa mundial. Mas o desaparecimento da vitima passou despercebido por um mes sem que ninguem - parentes ou vizinhos - notasse a ausencia.

Ainda sob comocao, chineses se perguntam como foi possivel que uma mulher tenha ficado presa em um elevador e morresse la dentro sem que o corpo fosse descoberto.

O elevador, de um predio residencial na cidade de Xian, havia sido desligado por dois trabalhadores de manutencao em 30 de janeiro. O cadaver da mulher foi localizado em 1o de marco.

O episodio motivou um debate sobre padroes de seguranca na China, mas tambem sobre temas como a situacao de mulheres adultas solteiras (estigmatizadas na China) e o cuidado a doentes mentais no pais.

Elevadores que 'engolem pessoas'

""Trinta dias. Quanta dor e sofrimento deve ter havido? Meu coracao doi por ela"", escreveu o usuario Huixinya na rede social Weibo, o Twitter da China.

Outros manifestaram horror e pena pela morte da mulher de 43 anos, identificada publicamente pelo apelido familiar: Wu.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Vizinhos e parentes nao denunciaram o desaparecimento da mulher.

O fato de os funcionarios terem feito apenas uma rapida verificacao - gritando por alguem dentro do elevador - antes de desligar o aparelho tambem provocou reacoes indignadas.

Meios de comunicacao chineses informaram que os encarregados da manutencao e os responsaveis pela administradora do predio foram presos sob acusacao de homicidio culposo (sem intencao de matar).

""Era tao dificil simplesmente abrir o elevador e verificar?"", questionou um usuario nas redes sociais. ""E se fosse uma pessoa surda?"", perguntou outro.

Houve ainda criticas aos funcionarios, apontados como preguicosos e irresponsaveis. ""Isso nao foi causado por um acidente de trabalho, mas por trabalhadores sem integridade pessoal basica"", disse um internauta no Weibo.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Em 2015 houve outro acidente polemico na China, em que uma mulher caiu dentro de uma escada rolante defeituosa.

O episodio renovou preocupacoes em relacao a padroes de seguranca precarios e a uma cultura que prefere encurtar processos. Em um caso polemico recente, uma mulher morreu apos cair de uma escada rolante com defeito em um shopping.

""A onda recente de mortes em elevadores e escadas rolantes nao pode ser atribuida simplesmente a problemas de fabricacao, mas a deveres incumpridos e manutencao descuidada"", dizia um comentario no portal Red Net, que reivindicava mais fiscalizacao para ""curar a doenca dos elevadores que engolem pessoas"".

App para mulheres solteiras

Com informacoes que apontam que Wu, a mulher morta no elevador, vivia sozinha e tinha pouco contato com a familia, tambem surgiram inquietacoes sobre a seguranca das mulheres solteiras.

Houve quem manifestasse surpresa pelo fato de ninguem ter alertado autoridades sobre a ausencia da mulher, o que mostraria o crescente isolamento das pessoas em grandes cidades.

Xiaowuerfu, um usuario do Weibo, apontou: ""Talvez poderia haver um app onde diariamente alguem desse dois toques, e pelo qual a policia fosse avisada caso esse toque nao fosse feito apos dois dias"".

""Pensava que casos assim so ocorressem em areas rurais, mas uma metropole e tambem uma floresta de aco, voce esta rodeado por tanta gente, pode ter muitos amigos, mas poucas conexoes reais"", disse outro usuario.

Image copyright Getty Image caption Mulheres solteiras sao estigmatizadas na China, pais que prioriza o papel feminino de mulher e mae.

A situacao das mulheres solteiras, estigmatizadas na China como ""sheng un"", ou mulheres encalhadas, e um assunto que ha tempo preocupa uma cultura que prioriza o casamento e a maternidade na vida das mulheres.

O Estado ja tentou incentivar mais mulheres solteiras a se casar, principalmente pelo grande desequilibrio de genero causado pelo fim da politica que permitia o nascimento de apenas um filho por casal.

Problemas mentais

Informacoes que circularam sobre o caso do elevador, atribuidas a vizinhos nao identificados, davam conta que Wu sofria de problemas mentais.

Ainda que as informacoes nao tenham sido confirmadas, houve um debate sobre o cuidado a pessoas com esse tipo de enfermidade.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption O caso suscitou debate sobre normas e procedimentos de seguranca na China.

""Como a familia pode ter permitido que ela desaparecesse por um mes? O que houve com a sua comunidade, o que estavam fazendo?"", perguntou um usuario.

Outros criticaram a imprensa e questionaram a relevancia do tema.

""Isso nao tem nada a ver com o fato de a vitima ter problemas mentais. Por acaso uma pessoa sa poderia ter sobrevivido um mes presa em um elevador?"", foi outro comentario.

""Esse fato ocorreu e agora discutem o historico de saude mental da mulher. Por Deus, os doentes mentais nao sao pessoas tambem?"", afirmou outro comentarista.",[]

bbc.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Why this caterpillar wears a hat made of discarded heads,['Yao-hua Law'],"Imagine a caterpillar, green and yellow and about 0.8 inches (2cm) long. A rich coat of fine white hair sprouts from its back and sides. And bizarrely, what looks like a horn sticks up from its head.

You now have a mental image of the Australian caterpillar known as the gum leaf skeletoniser (Uraba lugens). Their name refers to the caterpillars' destructive habit of stripping the leaves of Eucalyptus gum trees to mere veins and mid-ribs.

Behavioural ecologist Petah Low studied the caterpillars for her PhD at the University of Sydney, and eventually became rather fond of them. ""I gave them a name,"" says Low. ""Unicorn caterpillars."" One writer has called them ""Mad Hatterpillars"".

The horn on a unicorn caterpillar is actually a stack of its old, empty head casings. Effectively, it is wearing a pile of its old skulls.

Low's research could now explain why it has adopted such unconventional headgear.

A caterpillar's body is a squishy sausage of flesh and fluid encased in a tough outer skin. As it grows it eventually gets too big for its own skin, at which point it molts: the caterpillar cracks the old skin, crawls out, and grows a new larger skin.

Each gum leaf skeletoniser molts up to thirteen times before spinning a cocoon and transforming into an adult moth. Starting from the fourth molt, the gum leaf skeletoniser keeps the head shells from its old skins and stacks them on its head.

It is not quite clear how the stack is held in place, but the caterpillar does have a crown of hairs that might help to anchor it.

That is a pretty unusual thing to do. Most insects discard their old skin, and some eat it, but only a handful of species make horns out of their old head shells. So why do they do it?

In a study published in 2014, Low probed gum leaf skeletonisers with forceps to simulate attacks. ""They reared their heads back, as if they were trying to protect their backs with the head shell stack,"" says Low. ""The stack extended the caterpillar's reach and knocked my forceps around.""

So Low wondered if the head shell stack helps protect the caterpillar, an idea first proposed in the 1980s. To find out, she tested how the caterpillars use their horns. Her latest results have now been published in PeerJ.

Low placed two caterpillars in a petri dish, one with a head shell stack and one without, then introduced a predatory stinkbug into the arena and watched what happened.

The stinkbug probed the caterpillar with its rostrum, a needle-like mouth that injects toxins and sucks prey dry. In response the caterpillar thrashed about, swung its head, regurgitated food and retreated.

This video shows a typical attack.

This media cannot be played on your device.

The caterpillars without head shells succumbed within 14 seconds, but the caterpillars with head shells thwarted the predator for at least 120 seconds  although they also succumbed in the end.

Often, the bug stabbed the head shells instead of the caterpillar, suggesting that the horn confuses predators. Also, when the bug stabbed the soft flesh behind the armoured head, the caterpillar swung its horn to deflect the bug's needle.

It was a small study, so the results are inconclusive. But Low feels ""very confident that the head shell stack played a part in prolonging the attack.""

In the wild, the young caterpillars gather in groups. To find out if this made a difference, Low placed 600 caterpillars in groups of ten on the leaves of gum trees. One set of groups had all their horns removed, another had all its horns intact, and a third had an equal mix of both.

After eight days, only one in six caterpillars still lived. Groups of caterpillars with head shells did not survive better than those without. But within the mixed groups, twice as many caterpillars with head shells survived than those without head shells.

This suggests that a horn does not help a caterpillar much if most nearby caterpillars also have them. But in the wild, different caterpillars have different numbers of head shells. So a gum leaf skeletoniser's horn might just protect it, as long as its horn is better than those of its neighbours, says Low.",[]

Pemerintah Indonesia menyatakan 56 perusahaan diduga terlibat kebakaran hutan yang melanda sebagian wilayah Sumatra dan Kalimantan tahun ini, dengan 16 di antaranya dikenai sanksi pembekuan izin serta tiga perusahaan dicabut izinnya.

Selain itu Polri masih memeriksa 301 kasus lainnya terkait kebakaran hutan dan lahan yang melanda beberapa provinsi di Kalimantan maupun Sumatera tahun ini.

Usaha pemerintah untuk menghukum pihak yang diduga terkait dengan kebakaran hutan di Kalimantan dan Sumatera tahun ini perlu diapresiasi, kata Herry Purnomo, ahli tata kelola dan kebijakan publik dari lembaga Center for International Forestry Research atau biasa disebut CIFOR.

Sebab, pada tahun-tahun terdahulu pemerintah jarang sekali mencabut dan membekukan izin perusahaan.

""Umumnya tidak dibekukan kalau dahulu. Cuma diadili, lalu suruh bayar bisa manajernya, direkturnya atau pegawainya,"" kata Herry kepada wartawan BBC Indonesia, Rizki Washarti.

Image copyright Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana Image caption Kebakaran hutan tahun ini dianggap yang terparah dalam beberapa tahun terakhir.

Tapi Herry mengingatkan bahwa pembekuan dan pencabutan izin tersebut harus diikuti dengan pengawasan.

""Ketika dibekukan, itu kan berhenti beroperasi, kemudian yang mengawasi siapa? Yang mengawasi kan seharusnya pemerintah yah. Kalau tidak diawasi oleh pemerintah, bisa pihak-pihak lain mengambil lahan itu,"" jelas Herry.

Tak menjamin

Sementara itu, Menkopolhukam Luhut Pandjaitan mengatakan tidak bisa menjamin bahwa kebakaran hutan tidak akan terjadi lagi tahun depan.

""Kita akan membuat seminimal mungkin asap. Belajar dari pengalaman tahun ini. Tentu kita tidak mau lagi rakyat kita tercemar dengan asap lebih banyak ke depan,"" kata Luhut.

""Itu komitmen kami. Tapi kalau ditanya, apakah ada lagi asap tahun depan, ya orang masak nasi aja ada asapnya,"" tambah Luhut.

Kebakaran hutan dan lahan di Sumatera dan Kalimantan tahun menurut Bank Dunia merugikan pemerintah sekitar Rp221 triliun.

Sir Elton mulai mengumpulkan foto sejak 25 tahun lalu dan kini memiliki lebih dari 7.000 foto, termasuk karya fotografer terkenal Man Ray dan Berenice Abbott.

Foto-foto yang terpilh akan dibawa dari rumah-rumah Elton John -yang berada di sejumlah negara- ke London untuk pameran bulan November.

""Era modern dalam fotografi merupakan salah satu kunci di media tersebut dan mengumpulkan karya-karya dalam periode tersebut memberi kegembiraan bagi saya selama 25 tahun terakhir,"" kata Elton John.

Dia menambahkan setiap foto memberi inspirasi dalam kehidupannya.

Selain mengabadikan seniman-seniman dunia, koleksi Elton John juga mencakup foto telanjang, peristiwa-peristiwa penting, gerakan budaya, dan kondisi sosial, antara lain merekam kesulitan hidup pada masa Depresi Ekonomi Besar tahun 1930-an.

Tate Modern mengatakan pameran The Radical Eye menandai kerja sama jangka panjang dengan Elton John untuk memberi kesempatan bagi khalayak umum menikmati foto-oto langka koleksi penyanyi Inggris tersebut.",[]

bbc.com,2016-02-25 00:00:00,The worlds most secretive places,['Husna Haq'],"The most alluring things in life are often those that are off-limits. And as travellers, this means that were fascinated by places that were not allowed to visit. To locate some of these oh-so-tantalizing wonders, we turned to question-and-answer site Quora.

From an isolated Pacific island without running water to a James Bond-like spy base in England, here are five of the worlds most secretive places.

Svalbard Global Seed Vault, Norway

Imagine a world forever changed by a massive natural disaster: Earths population ravaged, its infrastructure devastated, its food sources decimated. A lone survivors mission: to rebuild.

In such a Hollywood-inspired apocalyptic scenario, where does a hero go? Enter the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway, humanitys last stand against a global food crisis.

Located 120m inside a sandstone mountain on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen in the remote Arctic Svalbard archipelago, 1,300km from the North Pole, the Svalbard Global Seed Vault is the most highly secured, robustly guarded seed bank in the world.

Opened in February 2008, the vault guards Earths crops against global catastrophe. With 250 million crop seeds from around the world packaged in special four-ply packets and heat-sealed to guard against moisture, it provides samples of seeds that may be lost due to accident, equipment failures, funding cuts and natural disasters.

Theres a reason scientists chose Spitsbergen: the island isnt rocked by tectonic activity, has preservation-boosting permafrost and is 130m above sea level, ensuring the site will remain dry  and the seeds safe  even if global warming causes ice caps to melt. So secure is Spitsbergen, in fact, that studies project seeds could survive there for hundreds, if not thousands, of years.

But, said Nargis Ansari, unless youre a designated researcher or plant breeder youre not allowed inside the vault.

Niihau, Hawaii

Niihau, the smallest inhabited Hawaiian island, may appear to be the ideal tropical escape  after all, its home to swaying palm trees, endangered animals and virtually no tourists  but its not. Thats because this 180sqkm Pacific island is off-limits to outsiders.

Sold by Hawaiis King Kamehameha in 1863 to the prominent Robinson family  who were wealthy plantation owners  the island has outlawed outsiders since 1915. Life on the isolated island is unusual: its roughly 130 permanent inhabitants, who are Native Hawaiians, live rent-free, and do without paved roads, telephone services, plumbing, running water or stores. Horses and bicycles provide transportation, solar power provides electricity and barges deliver groceries from nearby Kauai.

The island has outlawed outsiders since 1915.

Children from Ni'ihau take canoes to Kauai weekly to attend school, explained Bennett McEwan.

Though tiny, the island has played an outsize role in history. It was the site of the Niihau Incident in 1941, when, following the attack on Pearl Harbor, a Japanese navy fighter pilot crashed on the island and terrorized its residents for a week. And in 1944, US president Franklin D Roosevelt considered Niihau as a possible location for the United Nations headquarters.

The island remains off limits today, wrote McEwan. The Coast Guard patrols the island to ensure that no landings are attempted. No one is permitted to visit without an invitation from someone on the island.

That said, there are ways for wily travellers to get a glimpse of the forbidden isle.

In 1987, hunting tours of the island were offered, which involve receiving an invitation from the tour operator who lives on the island, McEwan said. Helicopter tours over the island or boat tours off the coast are the only other ways to get close.

Royal Air Force Menwith Hill, England

If James Bond had a secret bunker, this would be it. A military base in North Yorkshire, England, RAF Menwith Hill is believed to be the biggest electronic monitoring station in the world, intercepting communications to gather intelligence for the United Kingdom and the United States.

The top-secret base was built in 1954 to monitor the Soviet Unions Cold War communications. No one knows for sure how the base is used today, but it allegedly investigates international terrorist actions and drug trades, and acts as a ground station for US satellites. It is also believed to have ties to ECHELON, also known as Five Eyes, the Bond-esque global spy network comprised of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the US.

Bad news for lovers of Bond and John Le Carre: Theres no way to see inside the inner workings of this real-life spy headquarters, said Quora user Alberta Adams. The only people allowed to enter here are members of the NSA [the US National Security Agency] and ECHELON.

Vatican Secret Archives, Vatican

Perhaps the most private library in the world, the Vatican Secret Archives is no ordinary library. It contains the personal documents of all the popes dating back to the 8th Century.

Closed to all non-Vatican figures until 1881, the archive keeps top-secret documents under lock and key, with a long and complex application process for those keen to access its secrets.

Only qualified scholars may apply for entry cards. Applications must include personal information about the scholar, the purpose of his or her research, and an introductory letter from an institute of research or a qualified scholar in historical research.

Even if a scholar is granted entry, the archives (considered the Popes personal property), are extensive: there are an estimated 85km of shelving containing more than 35,000 volumes, according Adams.

Among the archives historical treasures? The 1521 papal bull from Pope Leo X excommunicating Martin Luther and launching the Reformation; 14th-century transcripts from the trial of the Knights Templar; correspondence from Michelangelo (16th Century) and Abraham Lincoln (19th Century); and an 1198 papal bull calling for a Fourth Crusade to the Holy Land.

Area 51, Nevada

What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. And the same could be said of a secretive site located some 80 miles to the north.

Area 51, a term first used in a Vietnam War-era CIA document, is a military base and airfield thats known for keeping highly classified secrets of state.

What happens there? The CIA wont give specifics, which is why the sites purpose is rife with conspiracy theories, said Ranvijai Raji. Do they dissect crashed alien aircraft? Produce lasers or particle-beam weapons? Test experimental aircraft?

The truth is, we may never know for sure. All activity in Area 51 is considered top secret and access is strictly prohibited to outsiders. Though many people try.

The United Nations refugee agency is saying a provisional deal, agreed between Turkey and the European Union to stop uncontrolled migration to Europe, would violate international law. Under the deal, Turkey would take back illegal migrants arriving in the Greek islands in return for the EU resettling Syrians from Turkish camps.

Millions of people across parts of Asia and the Pacific have been experiencing a rare total solar eclipse. The moon passed directly in front of the sun, blocking direct sunlight, creating a night-time effect. For a time the darkness was total across a strip 150km wide.

The influential British record producer Sir George Martin, often called the 'fifth Beatle', has died at the age of 90. The news was made public in a message posted on social media by Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. Sir George produced most of The Beatles' hit singles and his accomplishments extended beyond the famous four-piece with which he was so closely associated.

A las familias les gustan las cabanas cercanas a la costa para descansar, bucear, hacer largas caminatas y disfrutar del paisaje. Los grupos de jovenes prefieren quedarse en el centro de la poblacion, donde estan las discotecas y las fiestas duran toda la noche.

Son los contrastes de Montanita, la comuna en la costa oeste de Ecuador donde las turistas argentinas Marina Menegazzo y Maria Jose Coni, de 21 y 22 anos de edad, fueron asesinadas hace dos semanas.

Esta pequena localidad de menos de 5.000 habitantes, que solo hace unos anos era considerada un ""paraiso escondido"", ahora es el destino turistico preferido por decenas de miles de jovenes de America Latina, Estados Unidos y Europa.

Alli disfrutan de sus playas, del turismo de aventura y su cada vez mas famosa vida nocturna.

Sus calles estrechas que desembocan en la playa con coloridas tiendas, bares, hoteles y restaurantes cautivaron en pocos anos a universitarios que viajan como ""mochileros"" y disfrutan las actividades al aire libre.

Sin embargo, Montanita no siempre fue un destino turistico con cocteles en las calles y fiestas en la playa.

El ""descubrimiento""

Hace 50 anos, en Montanita los pescadores compartian las costas con unos pocos turistas ""alternativos"".

En esa epoca fue cuando el ""movimiento surfer"", con su filosofia de libertad, paz y amor al mar y a las olas, desembarco en ese insospechado lugar ubicado a menos de 200 kilometros de Guayaquil.

Image copyright Ministerio de Deportes de Ecuador Image caption En 2013, Montanita fue sede del mundial de surf.

Montanita estaba muy lejos de ser el ""destino de moda"" entre los jovenes en el que se ha convertido ahora.

Era mas bien una pequena comuna costera de pescadores rodeada por rios y montanas verdes ideales para escalar y hacer caminatas.

Sus casas todavia eran construcciones sencillas y no habia ni rastro de los complejos turisticos y hoteles que ahora se pueden encontrar a lo largo de la costa y en casi todas las calles de la localidad.

Segun explica Hector Yepez, dirigente regional y docente en Guayaquil, el panorama en Montanita cambio drasticamente en la ultima decada.

""Antes habia mucha menos gente y era un lugar mucho mas tranquilo. En Montanita te encontrabas con extranjeros que eran del movimiento hippie, surfer y hasta rockero"", senalo a BBC Mundo el dirigente de la agrupacion Suma (opositor).

El boom

Pero ultimamente, la noche de Montanita se ha vuelto cada vez mas famosa en America Latina.

Se pueden encontrar comida rapida y platos a la carta entre US$3 y US$10. Los tragos se venden a precios baratos y en oferta en los bares.

Image copyright Ministerio de Turismo de Ecuador Image caption La vida nocturna en Montanita atrae jovenes de Sudamerica desde la segunda decada del siglo XXI.

Uno de los lugares mas concurridos es la ""calle de los cocteles"". Un paseo que desemboca en la playa en el que se pueden conseguir bebidas alcoholicas durante todo el dia y en el que la musica nunca deja de sonar.

Fue en ese lugar donde Marina Menegazzo y Maria Jose Coni vendian empanadas y ensalada de frutas, segun los testimonios de viajeros que afirman que las vieron y que medios de comunicacion argentinos publicaron en las ultimas semanas.

La mayoria de las discotecas son gratuitas y cuando se mete el sol la gente sale a bailar en la playa y en las calles.

Grupos improvisan musica reggae sobre la arena, mientras otros bailan salsa en una discoteca con piscina al lado de la pista.

Por si fuera poco, pueden encontrarse hoteles en los que la noche no cuesta mas de US$25. Tambien existen hostales con habitaciones compartidas en los que el precio por persona se reduce aun mas.

El diario Publimetro de Santiago publico que Montanita fue el destino favorito de los jovenes chilenos en 2013; al igual que lo fue en 2012 para los argentinos, segun el diario bonaerense La Nacion.

De hecho, son cada vez mas los universitarios portenos que cambian el tradicional viaje ""de mochila"" por el norte argentino hasta las ruinas de Machu Picchu en Peru por el economico viaje a las calidas playas de Montanita.

Image copyright Pixabay Image caption La playa de Montanita tiene olas de hasta 2,5 metros que son ideales para la practica del surf.

La vicepresidenta de la Asociacion de Actores Turisticos de Montanita, Cristina Barreiro, le explico a BBC Mundo que la mayoria del turismo latinoamericano llega entre diciembre y febrero, mientras que los visitantes de Europa y Estados Unidos arriban a mediados de ano.

""Cuando empezamos a recibir visitantes, el surf fue uno de los principales atractivos, pero ahora hemos ampliado la oferta turistica y nuestras fiestas son las que mas gente atraen"", senalo Barreiro, que ademas es propietaria del Cana Grill, una concurrida discoteca y karaoke de Montanita.

El vicepresidente de la Federacion Nacional de Camaras Provinciales de Turismo de Ecuador, Diego Vivero, le dijo a la Agencia EFE que Argentina es el cuarto pais latinoamericano del que mas visitantes llegan a Ecuador tras Peru, Colombia y Venezuela.

En 2015, unos 60.000 argentinos arribaron a la region, con estancias promedio de una semana y un gasto medio de US$1.000.

Image copyright Pixabay Image caption En Montanita se pueden encontrar hoteles con precios accesibles, comida barata y tragos en oferta.

La industria turistica ecuatoriana senalo que solo los visitantes estadounidenses generan US$545 millones anuales.

Es facil encontrar en las redes sociales y blogs de los visitantes de Europa, Estados Unidos y America Latina fotografias y relatos de lo facil que es conseguir un cigarro de marihuana y como el alcohol se puede encontrar a cualquier hora del dia.

""Se ha transformado en el destino de los excesos. Si te encantan la fiestas en la playa repletas de excesos, Montanita es tu lugar, si no, puede que no la pases tan bien"", advierte uno de los visitantes en la red social de viajeros Tripadvisor.

No todo es tan idilico como lo muestran las fotos de los economicos paquetes turisticos que se ofertan por internet.

El peligro

El asesinato de Marina Menegazzo y Maria Jose Coni multiplico la preocupacion, pero la delincuencia en Montanita ya habia llamado la atencion de los pobladores del lugar y de las autoridades en los anos previos.

Barreiro asegura que la muerte de las dos jovenes argentinas fue un hecho aislado, pero reconoce que los problemas vienen de tiempo antes.

""Nosotros denunciamos hace anos de la llegada de personas de otros puntos de Ecuador y de otros paises para hacer negocios ilicitos. La falta de control y la informalidad de ciertos negocios trajeron problemas. Por eso le pedimos a las autoridades que regulen esto"", senalo a BBC Mundo.

Hector Yepez, que conoce Montanita hace decadas, anade que el crecimiento del turismo interno y la llegada de visitantes extranjeros, sumados al aumento de la delincuencia en Ecuador, genero que Montanita no sea un lugar tan seguro como hace apenas unos anos.

Desde el pasado miercoles, personal de la Secretaria Tecnica de Drogas arribo al lugar y la Direccion Nacional de Operaciones de la Policia incrementara la presencia de efectivos de 20 a 50.

Image copyright Pixabay Image caption La economia de Ecuador esta dolarizada.

La Policia Judicial Ecuatoriana senalo en 2015 que el promedio de hurtos era de 15 cada fin de semana.

Ademas de registrarse asaltos en las calles, se reportaron robos en hoteles y hurtos de accesorios de vehiculos.

En los primeros meses de 2016 se realizaron 11 operativos antinarcoticos en los que se detuvieron a 12 traficantes.

Uno de los problemas que detectaron las autoridades policiales y la Asociacion de Actores Turisticos es que en Montanita ofrecen drogas baratas como marihuana y derivados de cocaina en las esquinas de algunos centros nocturnos.

Ante tal situacion, el presidente de la comunidad de Montanita, Ivan del Pezo, anuncio el martes que la region esta dispuesta a una ""intervencion integral"" para frenar los problemas relacionados a la venta desmedida de drogas y alcohol.

""En Montanita hemos tenido problemas, efectivamente. Como mucha gente manifiesta, hay personas que hacen actividad de venta de drogas, como sucede en muchos lados"", senalo la autoridad.

No solo son las autoridades, tambien los pobladores que viven del turismo temen que los visitantes dejen de llegar.

Por ello los duenos de hoteles y pobladores impulsan en redes sociales un movimiento llamado #MontanitaNoTieneLaCulpa para que el asesinato de las dos argentinas no estigmatice al lugar como un destino peligroso.

Todo para que Montanita no vuelva a ser ese ""paraiso escondido"" como cuando no llegaba casi nadie.",[]

bbc.com,,Zika virus: Sexual transmission 'more common than thought',[],"Image copyright AP Image caption Zika is most commonly spread by mosquitoes, but several countries have now reported cases of sexual transmission

Sexual transmission of the Zika virus is more common than previously thought, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).

After an emergency committee meeting on Tuesday, the UN health agency also said there was increasing evidence of links between Zika and various birth defects.

Zika is most commonly spread by mosquitoes but several countries have reported cases of sexual transmission.

The WHO last month said the outbreak constitutes a global emergency.

WHO Director General Dr Margaret Chan said ""reports and investigations in several countries strongly suggest that sexual transmission of the virus is more common than previously assumed"".

She called the development ""alarming"".

Dr Chan also said that microcephaly - a birth defect strongly linked to the Zika outbreak in Brazil - was just one of several conditions that the WHO had linked to the virus.

More on the Zika crisis:

Another is Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS). Nine countries have now reported an increase in cases of GBS, a rare condition that can cause temporary paralysis and death.

Dr Chan said problems linked to Zika were now being seen not just in women of child-bearing age, but children, teenagers and older adults.

She said public health officials should not wait for definitive scientific proof of links between the virus and various health conditions before issuing guidance.

The WHO has advised pregnant women to avoid travelling to areas with ongoing Zika outbreaks, and to practice safe sex with anyone who has or abstain from sex for the duration of their pregnancy.

""Women who are pregnant in affected countries or travel to these countries are understandably deeply worried,"" Dr Chan said.

The US is investigating more than a dozen possible cases of Zika in people who may have been infected through sex.

A vaccine for the Zika virus could be ready for human trials later this year, Dr Anthony Fauci, who is leading the US government's research programme, said last week.

Dr Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he hopes to start testing a DNA vaccine by September.

bbc.com,,Volkswagen's US chief leaves troubled German carmaker,[],"Image copyright Reuters

Volkswagen's top executive in the US is stepping down nearly six months after the German carmaker became engulfed in the diesel emissions scandal.

Michael Horn, president and chief executive officer of Volkswagen (VW) of America since 2014, is leaving ""through mutual agreement"", the company said.

The statement made no mention of the emissions issue, disclosed by US regulators last year.

Another US executive, Hinrich Woebcken, takes over on a interim basis.

Mr Horn's departure comes as VW continues to negotiate with US environmental regulators, the Department of Justice, and lawyers representing consumers who are suing the company for compensation.

VW said Mr Horn's departure was ""effective immediately"".

In VW's statement, Herbert Diess, chief executive of the Volkswagen Passenger Cars brand, said: ""I want personally to say 'thank you' to Michael Horn for the great work he has done for the brand and with the dealers in the United States.""

The company has admitted that its Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche diesels, marketed as environmentally friendly, were equipped with devices that lowered emissions results during tests.

Almost 600,000 VW cars in the US are affected, but the company says about 11 million vehicles worldwide were fitted with the engine software.

VW has acknowledged that the costs for recalls, compensation and fines could run into many billions of euros.

Last September, just after US regulators disclosed VW's use of the so-called ""defeat devices"", Mr Horn, 54, said at a vehicle launch event that the company ""totally screwed up"".

He was the senior VW representative to appear before a Congressional committee investigating the scandal. Mr Horn said the emissions devices were the work of a few individuals, but not VW's top leadership.

Mr Woebcken, the North American regional chief and chairman of Volkswagen Group of America, takes over immediately.",[]

Questionados sobre as maiores qualidades de Donald Trump, muitos eleitores do empresario costumam citar sua recusa em ser ""politicamente correto"".

""O grande problema deste pais e ser politicamente correto"", disse o pre-candidato Republicano em 2015 quando indagado sobre declaracoes ofensivas que havia feito contra mulheres.

Em sua campanha, o empresario ja afirmou que imigrantes mexicanos eram ""estupradores"", defendeu impedir a entrada de muculmanos nos Estados Unidos e insinuou que uma jornalista havia lhe tratado com rispidez porque estaria menstruada.

Na mesma medida em que inflama seus criticos, as posturas lhe rendem elogios entre seus apoiadores, para quem Trump apenas ""diz as coisas como elas sao"". Segundo eles, ao se posicionar sobre os mais variados assuntos, o empresario nao se curva a sensibilidades e patrulhas linguisticas que dificultam o combate de problemas reais dos Estados Unidos, como a criminalidade e o terrorismo.

Analises indicam, porem, que a cruzada de Trump contra o politicamente correto se insere numa batalha politica e cultural mais ampla, que vai bem alem da linguagem. O embate muitas vezes poe direita e esquerda em lados opostos e se reproduz em varios cantos do mundo, inclusive no Brasil.

Da Guerra Fria a cultura

Em artigo recente no The Washington Post, Philip Bump analisou o emprego da expressao ""politicamente correto"" ao longo da historia americana. Ele diz que a expressao ganhou popularidade durante a Guerra Fria, quando era normalmente associada ao comunismo.

Naquela epoca, diz o articulista, ""politicamente correto"" era o que o regime sovietico considerava correto. Ele cita uma reportagem de 1985 sobre uma importadora de discos. ""Atualmente o jazz e politicamente correto na Uniao Sovietica"", dizia o texto.

Image copyright AP Image caption Contornos que o debate vem ganhando nos ultimos anos sugerem que a pacificacao da disputa esta bem distante

Nos anos 1990 e com a implosao do regime sovietico, Bump diz que a expressao passou a ser mais usada no campo cultural, ligada a praticas ou expressoes que deveriam ser evitadas por ofender certos grupos.

E nesse contexto que muitos passam a associar o ""politicamente correto"" a uma postura cerceadora e que muitas vezes beiraria o ridiculo.

Alguns criticos costumam citar, ao exemplificar o que consideram exageros dessa atitude, o cancelamento da peca Dialogos da Vagina por uma faculdade de Massachusetts em 2015.

Tida como um manifesto feminista ao ser criada nos anos 1990, a peca foi rejeitada pela faculdade Mount Holyoke por nao ser inclusiva o suficiente: estudantes avaliaram que ela ignorava a experiencia de mulheres transexuais sem vagina.

Um artigo recente na Chronicles Magazine, publicacao de um instituto conservador americano, diz que o pensamento politicamente correto cala ou torna objeto de odio e escarnio todos que se recusam a seguir seus codigos.

O objetivo da pratica, segundo a revista, e exercer um controle social que ""torne impossivel a pessoas comuns manifestar suas queixas publicamente de uma maneira aceitavel, de modo que suas objecoes possam ser facilmente rejeitadas como expressoes de preconceituosos ignorantes"".

Para alguns, esse comportamento poe em risco a propria comunicacao e se choca com a Primeira Emenda da Constituicao americana, que garante a liberdade de expressao.

No outro lado da disputa, muitos avaliam que ser ""politicamente correto"" significa apenas tratar as pessoas com respeito, e que a oposicao aos codigos e alimentada por grupos que se recusam a rever privilegios ou deixar de usar expressoes racistas.

Um artigo no Christian Science Monitor diz que, para as geracoes que cresceram sob essa filosofia, ""o discurso e uma arma, e suprimir palavras que possam ser vistas como ofensivas ou odiosas e a nova fronteira dos direitos civis"".

Etiquetas

Diante desse embate, ha quem veja argumentos validos nos dois campos.

Em artigo na revista The Atlantic, Conor Friedersdorf diz que alguns codigos politicamente corretos - como a crenca de que americanos muculmanos merecem ser tratados como os demais cidadaos - ajudam a impedir que pessoas inocentes sofram injusticas.

Image copyright AP

Por outro lado, ele afirma que algumas praticas sao ""etiquetas arbitrarias que pessoas formadas em faculdades concorridas usam para se sentir superiores a outras"".

""Entre as normas chave que sao vitais a democracia e as demandas mais frivolas por correcao politica ha muitos territorios em disputa"", afirma o autor. Para ele, a ascensao de Trump mostra que pessoas que rejeitam os caprichos da elite intelectual estao ganhando espaco nesse embate.

Friedersdorf diz que criticos do ""trumpismo"" devem estudar os danos causados pelos exageros dessas normas, identificar quais delas merecem ser defendidas e convencer os americanos a adota-las voluntariamente, e nao sob a ameaca de humilhacao publica.

Mas os contornos que o debate vem ganhando nos ultimos anos sugerem que a pacificacao da disputa esta bem distante.

Para Philip Bump, do Washington Post, a expressao ""politicamente correto"" virou um guarda-chuva para varias ideias associadas a esquerda, como a defesa do casamento gay, da igualdade de generos e de acoes afirmativas em prol de minorias.

Nao por acaso, outros politicos que concorrem ou concorreram com Trump nas previas Republicanas tambem condenaram praticas ""politicamente corretas"".

Seu principal oponente, o senador Ted Cruz (Texas), disse que a ""correcao politica esta matando pessoas"", pois impediria o governo de investigar a comunicacao de potenciais extremistas muculmanos. Para o neurocirurgiao Ben Carson, que deixou a corrida ha poucos dias, a ""correcao politica esta arruinando nosso pais"".

No Brasil, politicos conservadores tambem tem se insurgido contra essas normas. O deputado federal Jair Bolsonaro (PP-RJ), um dos principais expoentes do grupo, costuma dizer que ""estamos vivendo a ditadura do politicamente correto"".

Tanto no caso americano como no brasileiro, o discurso ganha forca apos varios anos de governos mais a esquerda, que assumiram bandeiras em favor de minorias.

Curiosamente, Philip Bump nota que o sentido da expressao tem se reaproximado do que tinha na Guerra Fria.

""'Politicamente correto' hoje e em grande medida um sinonimo para 'o modo como a esquerda age'"", diz ele.",[]

bbc.com,2016-02-24 00:00:00,Ten reasons to love spring,['Jeremy Coles'],"Its the time of year when everything in nature is changing and promising new life and new hope.

After the long, dark, winter months, spring is literally a breath of fresh air. And as the days get longer, the nights get shorter, and it starts to feel warmer, nature responds in a big way.

So step outside and be rewarded with a crescendo of bird song, a display of flowers bursting into colourful life and the welcome sight of animals not seen since last year.

Here are ten reasons to get out and enjoy the season, so what are you waiting for?

Birdsong peaks

Bird song reaches a peak during spring, so its the perfect time to enjoy this treat for the ears. Our resident birds  such as blackbirds, great tits, robins and song thrushes  are already singing sweetly to proclaim ownership of their territories. As migrant birds return throughout the season, the songs grow in volume and diversity. But its not until the end of spring, when all our singing species are back, that the ensemble is complete and the dawn chorus is in full swing. There is no better alarm clock, if you like to rise early...

Find out more about the voices of spring with the RSPB.

Animals awaken

As warmer temperatures begin to take hold, its time for our hibernating animals to come out of their winter sleep. The UKs most famous hibernating mammal is perhaps the hedgehog, but bats and dormice also hunker down over winter. For hedgehogs and bats in particular, slowing down their body processes during winter is the only way to survive when insects and invertebrates are hard to find and energy must be conserved. With the arrival of spring their food is back in supply and its time to get up for something to eat.

But its not just hedgehogs, bats and dormice we should look out for. Squirrels and badgers also become more active in the warmer weather and therefore easier to spot. And lets not forget our amphibians and reptiles  theyll be coming out of hibernation at this time of year, and are well worth keeping an eye out for.

Find out a little bit more about hibernation and mammals in winter with the Young Peoples Trust for the Environment.

Days are longer

For those looking forward to shorter nights and longer days, then look no further than 20 March. This is the spring - or vernal - equinox when the Earth's orbit around the sun results in almost equal lengths of day and night. The spring equinox is the astronomical start to the season, as opposed to 1 March which is the meteorological start.

Confused? Then let the Met Office explain the difference between meteorological and astronomical seasons.

Woodland wildflowers bloom

There are so many wildflowers that deserve your attention coming into bloom at this time of year  and not just the obvious bluebells later in the season, although they are a spectacle which does have to be seen! Pop into your local woodland and seek out some of the other beautiful wildflowers on display. Its best to go early in the season before the leaves on the trees close out the light. Make a beeline for yellow celandines, delicate white wood anemones and pungent wild garlic. Classics such as native daffodils and primroses are also instantly recognisable treats.

The National Wildflower Centre has a guide to identifying wildflowers in the UK.

The first bumblebees and butterflies venture forth

Theres nothing quite like the excitement of seeing your first bumblebee or butterfly of the year. Theyre one of the feel-good sights that give us a little taste of the summer to come. Warm days entice queen bumblebees from their underground hibernation sites to buzz around in search of flowers to gain energy and suitable places to nest. But its the early-emerging butterflies such as brimstone, peacock, orange-tip and speckled wood that usually grab the limelight with their colourful wings.

Find out more about the bumblebee life cycle with the Bumblebee Conservation Trust.

Mad March hares perform

The origin of the expression mad as a March hare becomes very clear if youre lucky enough to catch European brown hares engaging in a bit of eccentric leaping and boxing. Its a courtship ritual of sorts, as the females are fending off the advances of over-amorous males. Spring is the best time to catch a glimpse of this spectacle while arable crops are still short enough in the fields not to hide the action.

Find out a bit more about the European brown hare with the Mammal Society.

Natures confetti fills the air

Blossom is arguably one of most iconic heralds of spring. Dense clusters of blooming flowers, whether on hawthorn, blackthorn or fruiting trees, are short-lived so its best to enjoy them before the subtle white and pink petals fall to the earth like natures own confetti. Weve come to associate the spring blossom with ornamental fruit trees such as cherries, but it also includes plums and apples. Blossom is a sign of winter receding and the promise of a harvest to come.

What is Britain's best blossom?

Frogs and toads spawn

Its not for everyone, but frog and toad spawn is as much a reason to love spring as bluebells and cuckoos are. Or so it should be: theres a hypnotic beauty to the thick mass of clear jelly whose little black dots start to jostle to become the next generation of froglets and toadlets destined to leave the pond. Its only after the night temperatures begin to rise that the adults come out of hibernation to congregate at ponds to breed. Its a dangerous time, as many get killed crossing roads and a single late cold snap can spell disaster.

What you should know about the spawn in your garden.

Old friends return

Nature is at its busiest in spring, with millions of migrant birds returning to our shores for the summer to breed. Some of the earliest to arrive, although you might not notice them, are chiffchaffs, wheatears and sand martins. A bit later and the herald of spring  the cuckoo  arrives. For many, its instantly recognisable call is the definitive seasonal sound. A few other notable arrivals, among many, are the dazzling swallows and the sweet-sounding nightingale.

See what weve learnt so far about cuckoo migration.

Walks delight the senses

Last, but by no means least, take a walk in the countryside either as the sun comes up and starts to warm the air or last thing in the evening as the sun begins to go down. It doesnt matter where you go, it could be down a winding country lane or into some woodland, just spend a few minutes taking in all the sights, sounds and smells around you as nature springs back to life after its winter slow down. If you should happen to go into the woods, then swathes of white snowdrops, blazes of bluebells or pungent pockets of wild garlic are truly set to delight your senses.

Em uma das vizinhancas mais pobres de Bengasi, no front da batalha na Libia contra o grupo extremista autodenominado Estado Islamico (EI), uma corajosa professora mantem sua escola aberta.

Fauzia Mukhtar Abeid continua a dar aulas apesar da ameaca das explosoes de bombas e disparos feitos por franco-atiradores, determinada a fazer com que isso nao seja um obstaculo para a educacao de suas alunas.

""Tenho medo, muito medo. Temo que uma bomba caia em nos, porque a mesquita ao lado de nossa escola foi atacada faz pouco tempo"", diz a professora.

""Dispararam quando alguns estudantes iam receber licoes sobre o Alcorao. A primeira bomba caiu proxima a um menino, e outro correu para ajuda-lo. Entao, outra bomba veio, fazendo com uma das pernas do segundo garoto saisse voando. O primeiro tambem perdeu uma perna. Foi absolutamente horroroso.""

Ela tem todo o direito de ter medo, pois trabalha em uma escola no distrito de Sulmani, em Bengasi, um bairro da classe trabalhadora que, nos ultimos anos, tem estado em meio ao conflito armado em curso no pais.

A menos de 1km do patio da escola, escondidos entre as ruinas de um conjunto de apartamentos, estao combatentes do EI e outros militantes islamistas.

Reconstrucao

Image caption Fauzia Abeid quer dar um senso de normalidade a cidade e as estudantes

A escola foi fechada em maio de 2014, quando esta regiao se viu tomada por combatentes apos o lancamento da Operacao Dignidade, uma ofensiva militar para despejar as milicias islamistas alojadas em Bengasi.

As familias com melhores condicoes abandonaram o local rapidamente ou enviaram seus filhos para colegios privados, longe do alcance da violencia.

As criancas mais pobres nao tiveram outra opcao a nao ser ficarem em casa. Depois de um ano e fartos de verem suas perspectivas educacionais sumirem, alguns estudantes e seus pais comecaram a perguntar a professora Fauzia se ela reabriria a escola.

O predio havia sido bombardeado e saqueado. Por isso, os pais criaram um fundo para pagar pelos consertos necessarios.

Image caption Um vao aberto na parede de tras da escola da um acesso mais seguro as alunas

""Algumas familias contribuiram com 50 dinares (R$ 148), outras com 20 ou 5"", diz Hassan Omar, membro do conselho local. ""Ao final, arrecadamos cerca de 1 mil dinares das familias e recebemos outros 3 mil dinares do comite de crise do governo.""

Enquanto trocavam vidros quebrados, trabalhadores tambem abriram um vao na parede de tras da escola para que a alunas pudessem entrar por uma rua mais protegida dos disparos.

""Ha franco-atiradores a uns 3km de distancia"", explica Omar. ""Esta entrada nos ajuda a para evitar problemas.""

'Queremos aprender'

Image caption Aulas ocorrem entre os ruidos de balas e bombas

As aulas voltaram a ocorre em dezembro de 2015. A eletricidade e intermitente. Uma agua escura se acumulou em frente a entrada. E alguns professores se recusaram a voltar a trabalhar em um edificio que esta sob o alcance de militantes.

Mas as criancas estao decididas a continuar com sua educacao. ""Nao, nao temos medo"", diz uma adolescente de 15 anos. ""Queremos aprender.""

Walid al Furjani, pai de tres alunos da escola, concorda: ""Meus filhos ficaram sentados em casa sem fazer nada. Claro que me preocupo com eles, mas e importante que estudem"".

Muitos na Libia pensaram que, depois da deposicao do coronel e ditador Muammar Gaddafi, em 2011, gozariam outra vez das liberdades politicas basicas e teriam melhores perspectivas para seus filhos. Em vez disso, viram seu pais rachar em dezenas de faccoes que agora travam um combate entre si.

Segundo o site Libya Body Count, que contabiliza os mortos do conflito com base em noticias da imprensa, mais de 4 mil pessoas perderam suas vidas nos ultimos anos.

Alguns estimam que, atualmente, ha 2 mil milicias operando no territorio libio. Em meio ao caos, comerciantes de armas, jihadistas, guerreiros tribais e traficantes de pessoas tem prosperado.

Armamentos e municoes saqueados do arsenal de Gaddafi tem sido comercializados no deserto para impulsionar as insurgencias islamistas no Sahel, a regiao subsaariana da Africa.

Na direcao contraria, centenas de milhares de imigrantes e refugiados fugiram deseperadamente para a Europa, assim como jihadistas africanos decididos a unirem-se ao EI precisamente quando o grupo comecou a se assentar na Libia.

A ONU estima que, atualmente, ha cerca de 3 mil combatentes do EI no pais. Um dos distritos onde estebeleceram uma presenca e Sabri, que pode ser visto desde a escola de Fauzia.

Ela nao tinha motivo para voltar ao trabalho. Seus filhos estao crescidos, e falta pouco para ela aposentar-se. Mas, quando os pais lhe pediram que reabrisse a escola, nao pode recusar.

""Nao podia dizer nao a eles e a seus filhos. Senti que era um dever nacional. Minha consciencia exigia isso de mim, mesmo em condicoes perigosas. Espero que meu pais possa encontrar um caminho mais adiante"", diz ela.

""Ao abrir a escola, tentamos reestabelecer um pouco da normalidade aqui. Apesar desta guerra, apesar de toda a destruicao, seguimos adiante. Precisamos viver.

bbc.com,,Meat eating accelerated face evolution,[],"Image copyright RAUL MARTIN/MSF/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY Image caption Early humans reduced the need for big chewing muscles by incorporating meat into their diets

Eating raw meat and making stone tools may be behind the smaller teeth and faces of humans compared with their ancient relatives.

Meat and tools, not the advent of cooking, was the trigger that freed early humans to develop a smaller chewing apparatus, a study suggests.

This in turn may have allowed other changes, such as improved speech and even shifts in the size of the brain.

The authors conclude that cooking became commonplace much later.

Prof Daniel Lieberman and Dr Katherine Zink from Harvard University have published their work in the journal Nature.

The earliest members of our genus, Homo, are only sparsely represented in the fossil record.

By the time the species Homo erectus appeared about two million years ago, humans had evolved bigger brains and bodies that had increased our daily energy requirements.

But paradoxically, they had also evolved smaller teeth, as well as weaker chewing muscles and bite force. They also had a smaller gut than earlier human ancestors.

Something to chew on

One of the possible reasons for these changes, cooking, did not become commonplace until 500,000 years ago, the researchers found. This means that it probably did not play a significant role in the evolution of smaller chewing muscles and teeth.

""If you were to go and spend time with chimpanzees, you'd find that they spend.. about half of their day chewing,"" said Prof Lieberman.

""At some point in human evolution, there was a shift - we started to eat less. This shift is made possible by two factors: we eat a much higher quality diet than our ancestors, but we also eat food that has been heavily processed.""

The scientists evaluated chewing performance by feeding adult experimental subjects samples of meat, and the kind of vegetables our early ancestors might have consumed before incorporating meat into their diets.

They measured the muscular effort required for chewing and how well the food was broken up before swallowing.

The findings suggest that by eating a diet of one-third meat, and using stone tools to process the food - slicing the meat and pounding the plant material - early humans would have needed to chew 17% less often and 26% less forcefully.

In their paper, Lieberman and Zink argue: ""We further surmise that meat eating was largely dependent on mechanical processing made possible by the invention of slicing technology.

""Meat requires less masticatory force to chew per calorie than the sorts of generally tough plant foods available to early hominins, but the ineffectiveness of hominin molars to break raw meat would have limited the benefits of consuming meat before the invention of stone tools approximately 3.3 million years ago.""",[]

Lo llaman el David contra Goliat del desarme nuclear.

Esta semana las Islas Marshall, un archipielago del Pacifico de apenas 72.000 habitantes, se enfrenta en la Corte Internacional de Justicia (CIJ) el principal organo judicial de Naciones Unidas ante algunas de las potencias nucleares del planeta.

El motivo es una demanda que el pais presento ante este tribunal en abril de 2014.

Islas Marshall considera que Corea del Norte, China, EE.UU., Israel, Francia, India, Pakistan, Reino Unido y Rusia los paises con arsenales nucleares no han cumplido con los terminos del desarme establecidos en el Tratado de No Proliferacion Nuclear (NPT, segun sus siglas en ingles) de 1968.

Aunque como solo Reino Unido, India y Pakistan reconocen la autoridad de la CIJ, estos seran los unicos paises que se enfrentaran a los reclamos de la pequena nacion en el tribunal de La Haya, Holanda.

El caso es inedito y vuelve a poner sobre la mesa el siempre controvertido tema del desarme nuclear.

Conejillo de indias nuclear

La Republica de las Islas Marshall es un archipielago compuesto por 1.225 islas ubicado en medio del Oceano Pacifico.

Image copyright AFP Image caption A principios de los 80 EE.UU. construyo esta estructura sobre el crater dejado en la isla de Runit, luego de 43 explosiones nucleares. Se espera que la radioactividad dure unos 25.000 anos.

Fue descubierto por Espana en 1526, pero a lo largo de los siglos paso a estar bajo la soberania de potencias como Reino Unido, Alemania, Japon que se apodero del archipielago durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial y Estados Unidos.

Un ano despues del fin de la contienda mundial, el gobierno estadounidense comenzo a realizar pruebas nucleares en sus atolones.

Entre 1946 y 1958, 67 ensayos nucleares fueron llevado a cabo en el archipielago, ""un poder combinado equivalente a haber lanzado diariamente una bomba y media como la de la ciudad japonesa de Hiroshima durante 12 anos"", segun Rob Van Riet, quien forma parte del equipo legal del pequeno estado insular.

Muchas de las islas de mi pais fueron vaporizadas"" Tony de Brum, exministro de RR.EE. de Islas Marshall

Tony de Brum, exministro de Relaciones Exteriores de las Islas Marshall, explico ante la CIJ en La Haya, Holanda, las consecuencias de esas pruebas nucleares.

""Muchas de las islas de mi pais fueron vaporizadas. Otras deberan permanecer inhabitadas por miles de anos"", denuncio.

De Brum sabe en primera persona de lo que habla.

En 1954, a los 9 anos, estaba pescando con su abuelo cuando ""el cielo completo se volvio rojo"".

A 200 kilometros de donde estaba su bote, los cientificos estadounidenses hicieron explotar una bomba de hidrogeno 1.000 veces mas potente que la que devasto Hiroshima.

Y las consecuencias no fueron solo geologicas. Los habitantes del archipielago han debido lidiar durante generaciones con los problemas de la radiacion, que incluyen cancer y malformaciones geneticas.

La voz de los sin voz

Recien en 1990 el archipielago se independizo de EE.UU. y a pesar de seguir dependiendo en varios aspectos de la superpotencia, sus autoridades decidieron llevar su caso ante la CIJ para dar ejemplo.

Islas Marshall esta actuando como representante de muchos otros paises, algunos sin voz, porque no podemos dejarle la causa del desarme solo a los que tienen armas nucleares"" Rob van Riet, miembro del equipo legal de Islas Marshall

""Este no es un caso contra EE.UU., sino contra la proliferacion nuclear"", comenta a BBC Mundo Rob Van Riet, quien asegura que la obligatoriedad de desarme nuclear ""no la esta cumpliendo ninguna de las nueve potencias"" nucleares.

Tampoco hay intencion de negociar multilateralmente de buena fe una disminucion de los arsenales, asegura.

""Islas Marshall esta actuando como representante de muchos otros paises, algunos sin voz, porque no podemos dejarle la causa del desarme solo a los paises que tienen armas nucleares"", asegura el abogado.

Las potencias nucleares, por su parte, dipsutan la idea de que no han cumplido con lo que manda el tratado.

Segun cifras del gobierno britanico, por ejemplo, Reino Unido ha reducido su arsenal nuclear en un 50% desde el momento mas algido de la Guerra Fria.

Y, en la actualidad, las armas nucleares en su poder solamente representan un 1% del arsenal nuclear global.

David contra Goliat

El caso de las Islas Marshall contra India, Pakistan y Reino Unido no tiene precedentes.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Las Islas Marshall tienen unos 72.000 habitantes.

""Es uno de los paises mas pequenos que ha presentado un caso ante la CIJ"", le dice a BBC Mundo Paz Zarate, abogada experta en litigios internacionales ante la Corte.

""El exito de este caso es que pone el tema nuevamente en la agenda mundial"", ya que la Corte no se ha pronunciado desde 1996 sobre las armas nucleares.

""Es interesante la analogia de David y Goliat"", asegura por su parte Rob Van Riet.

El exito de este caso es que pone el tema nuevamente en la agenda mundial"" Paz Zarate, abogada experta en litigios internacionales.

""Pero esta vez se cambio la honda por la ley. Es un excelente ejemplo de como un pequeno estado lleva a varias superpotencias, no solo nucleares, sino economicas y militares ante un organismo internacional"", continua el abogado.

Y en el complicado escenario de las armas nucleares, lograr que la Corte se pronuncie aunque sea solo en uno de los casos seria un hito.

Ademas de sentar jurisprudencia tambien facilitaria un efecto domino para un consenso internacional sobre la materia: a ninguna potencia nuclear le conviene desarmarse sola.

El camino, eso si, no estara exento de obstaculos.

Generar atencion

Image copyright AP Image caption Islas Marshall es uno de los estados mas pequenos que presentan un caso ante la CIJ en La Haya.

Tras las audiencias preliminares, la CIJ debera decidir si el tema entra en su jurisdiccion y si los casos presentados por separado son admisibles. Solo cumpliendo esos dos puntos comenzaran los alegatos sobre el fondo del asunto.

Consultado por BBC Mundo, un vocero del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores britanico aseguro que ""seria inapropiado comentar un proceso judicial abierto"".

Sin embargo, Reino Unido ya presento una objecion preliminar, cuestionando que la CIJ tenga jurisprudencia y, de tenerla, que el caso sea admisible.

India y Pakistan no presentaron objeciones preliminares, al no haber firmado el NPT.

En su caso, el equipo legal de las Islas Marshall debera demostrar algo mucho mas vago: que no cumplieron una obligatoriedad determinada por el derecho consuetudinario, que se rige por normas no escritas que se cumplen porque se basan en hechos producidos reiteradamente en el tiempo en un territorio concreto, por lo que se vuelve costumbre cumplirlas.

""Es dificil establecer la costumbre. Aunque es una fuente de derecho internacional, el problema es demostrarla"", explica Paz Zarate.

Pase lo que pase, las Islas Marshall han logrado hacerse un nombre en la comunidad internacional.

""Aun cuando los casos fracasen, es un procedimiento que dura mucho tiempo y genera mucha atencion. Ademas, la Corte actua como un nivelador: estados pequenos, grandes, ricos y pobres son iguales ante ella"", concluye Zarate.",[]

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,Uruguay: una manana en un club cannabico donde siembran y distribuyen marihuana legalmente,"['Jacinta R', 'Uruguay Especial Para Bbc Mundo']","Image copyright Jacinta R. Trobo Image caption Como si fuera un vinedo, en el club vigilan los nutrientes y variaciones de cada ""cogollo"".

Lo primero que impacta al entrar en el pequeno galpon donde funciona la base de operaciones del club cannabico Tricoma es el olor, que lo impregna todo. En apenas un punado de metros cuadrados, Pedro Bianchi y Federico Mello, los directores de cultivo del club, se las ingenian para producir hasta diez especies diferentes de marihuana.

Son poco mas de las diez de la manana de un sabado y Pedro nos recibe en el porton de una casa familiar en un barrio del corazon de Montevideo. No hay carteles, nada indica que alli se producen cientos de gramos de marihuana por mes.

Si bien funcionan de forma legal desde el ano pasado, Pedro y los socios de Tricoma prefieren que la ubicacion se mantenga en secreto. ""Por seguridad y para no tener problemas con los vecinos"" alegan.

Estos clubes cannabicos son una de las alternativas legales que existen hoy en Uruguay para conseguir marihuana. En ellos, entre 15 y 45 consumidores se asocian para producir y distribuir de forma colectiva.

La regularizacion de la Ley de produccion, distribucion y venta del cannabis aprobada a finales de 2014 les dio luz verde para producir marihuana.

Tanto Pedro como Federico cultivaban de forma ilegal desde hacia anos. ""Corriamos ese riesgo porque queriamos saber que fumabamos, tener el control sobre lo que introduciamos en nuestro cuerpo"" detalla.

99 plantas

Mientras, abre una bolsa de plastico con cierre hermetico y saca una flor de marihuana. La desmenuza y explica las propiedades de la variedad que tiene en las manos.""De manana me gusta fumar LSD para estar bien despierto"", afirma.

Un par de hondas bocanadas, algunos sorbos de amargo mate y empieza el tour.

El director de cultivo explica con detalle el ciclo de vida de la planta y relata cada paso a seguir para conseguir los mejores ""cogollos"", palabra utilizada en Uruguay para denominar a las flores de la marihuana que contienen la sustancias cannabinoides.

Algun mimo y una sistematizacion rigurosa son los ingredientes principales para poder consumir flores de calidad, con un buen ""pegue"" y lo mas naturales posible.

Restan solo unos minutos para las 11. A esa hora empieza el ciclo nocturno de las plantas y las luces de la sala de floracion se apagaran durante 12 horas. Pedro abre el candado que encierra el tesoro mas preciado del club, las 99 plantas en flor (maximo permitido por la Ley).

Examina algunas flores y explica las caracteristicas de cada variedad y de las diferentes formas de cultivo. Como cualquier catador de vino, distingue cada cepa por el olor y aspecto de sus ""cogollos"".

""En este tipo de cultivo bajo techo debemos simular la perfeccion del afuera para hacer rendir la produccion"", explica. Para respetar los ciclos vitales de las plantas, despues de las once, no se pueden prender las luces ni abrir la puerta de la sala.

Ademas de este tipo de clubes, los uruguayos tienen otras dos alternativas legales para conseguir marihuana: el auto cultivo y un sistema de produccion estatal que comercializara la marihuana en farmacias hacia finales de 2016.

Aprobada durante el gobierno del ex Presidente Jose ""Pepe"" Mujica como apuesta para combatir al narcotrafico, esta norma posiciono a Uruguay a la vanguardia mundial, convirtiendose en el primer pais del mundo en regular el cultivo, distribucion y consumo de la marihuana.

Segun establece la Ley, cada club puede tener entre 15 y 45 socios. Ademas, es requisito indispensable ser residente en el pais. El maximo anual permitido es de 480 gramos por cada uno de los socios de un club.

El Instituto de Regulacion y Control del Cannabis (IRCCA) es el organismo responsable de otorgar las habilitaciones legales tras analizar el plan de produccion y visitar las instalaciones donde el club funcionara. Hasta el momento, diez clubes tiene su situacion regularizada.

----------------------------------

Salimos al patio y empieza a sonar musica brasilena. La discrecion es parte fundamental de todo el funcionamiento y es mejor que los vecinos no sepan de que estamos hablando ni para que.

La camaraderia impera entre los 22 socios de Tricoma que habitualmente visitan esta casa. Cuando vienen, ayudan con las labores de jardineria, experimentan alguna cepa nueva y comparten sensaciones. Ademas se llevan unos 40 gramos de marihuana por mes para consumir con fines recreativos.

Image copyright Jacinta R. Trobo Image caption Solo se pueden cultivar hasta 99 plantas.

Como ellos mismos se definen, Tricoma es un grupo de amigos. Gracias a su perseverancia, son el segundo club habilitado para producir marihuana en Uruguay.

La edad media de los miembros de este club ronda los 35 anos. El costo de la matricula para el ingreso es de 6.000 pesos (algo mas de 185 dolares) y, mes a mes, cada uno abona una cuota de 2.800 pesos (unos 86 dolares).

Todo importa

Las senas de identidad de Tricoma son dos: la investigacion y la trazabilidad. Los cultivadores registran meticulosamente cada paso durante el crecimiento de la planta para identificar las propiedades de cada una.

Ademas, en los paquetes que arman mensualmente para entregar a los socios, incluyen etiquetas donde se especifica el origen de cada ""cogollo"". De esta forma pueden ir personalizando las entregas mensuales a gusto del consumidor.

""Cada nutriente importa, cada variacion que haces conlleva un efecto distinto y potencia un uso diferente del cannabis"", explica Bianchi.

La ronda de mate y porro sigue girando. Tanto la infusion como la marihuana son sustancias con rituales parecidos en Uruguay, deben compartirse e ir pasando de una mano a otra. Seguimos con LSD, una cepa que agudiza los sentidos y permite concentrarse en los pequenos detalles que de otra forma pasarian desapercibidos.

Image copyright Jacinta R. Trobo Image caption En el club se cultivan diez especies diferentes de marihuana.

""Fumar de forma recreativa es solo la punta del iceberg de todos los usos del cannabis"" sentencia Lucia, secretaria del club, quien tambien participa de la charla. ""Existen posibilidades de utilizar el canamo como fibra textil o en la fabricacion de unguentos y aceites con fines medicinales"" explica.

""Una vez entregada la marihuana, cada socio decide como consumirla. Las posibilidades son muy amplias. Sabemos que hay socios que cocinan con ella y otros que la usan con fines medicinales para ellos o algun pariente cercano"", subraya Bianchi.

Los socios de este club consiguieron el primero de sus suenos, fumar legalmente el cannabis que ellos mismos cultivan. Ya se estan preparando para la segunda cosecha, que empieza en pocos dias. Sus proximos objetivos: mudarse a un lugar mas grande donde plantar mas y mejor, y abrirse a la comunidad para organizar talleres y debates sobre como y para que cultivar marihuana.",[]

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,Telanjang di panggung: Ketelanjangan kebenaran,['Holly Williams'],"Image copyright Getty Image caption Pertunjukan dengan elemen ketelanjangan dianggap mampu menarik penonton.

Janji penampilan kulit telanjang seringkali membuat tiket laku terjual. Itulah yang dilakukan Laura Henderson, pemilik teater West End di tahun 1930-an. Dia berhasil mengatasi penyensoran dengan menampilkan perempuan muda telanjang yang tidak bergerak sama sekali. Windmill menjadi teater paling digemari. Perempuan cantik tanpa pakaiannya lebih banyak menarik perhatian dibandingkan tarian dan nyanyian yang biasa dilakukan. Pantat telanjang ternyata membuat orang menonton. Dan teaternya adalah satu-satunya yang tidak ditutup selama Perang Dunia Pertama.

Cerita ini sempat disampaikan dalam versi film Mrs Henderson Presents, yang dibintangi Judi Dench, pada tahun 2005; dan sekarang dipentaskan di panggung London lewat drama musikal baru Terry Johnson. Ini adalah pertunjukan sama sekali telanjang dari bagian depan, bahkan para aktor juga harus menanggalkan pakaian untuk menunjukkan kesamaan gender. Drama musik ini mengisyaratkan bahwa selama Perang Dunia Kedua, warga Inggris yang sedang menderita dihibur pemandangan payudara. Semangat pertunjukan harus tetap dipentaskan yang mirip dengan semangat Inggris masa perang.

Mrs Henderson Presents pada umumnya diterima dengan baik oleh para kritikus. Meskipun ada yang mengecam seperti Daily Mail, pada umumnya film ini dilihat sebagai contoh menarik kepolosan erotik masa lalu, nyanyian para aktris tentang telanjang memberikan semangat tetapi juga membuat sebagian orang mengernyitkan dahi.

Image copyright REX Image caption Drama musik Hair sangat populer, meskipun adegan telanjang dan pemakaian obatnya dikecam para kritikus.

Tetapi sampai sejauh mana kita telah beranjak dari saat di mana telanjang di panggung dipandang sangat mengejutkan. Tahun 1968, Lord Chamberlain, penyensor teater, menjadi penguasa. Dia harus memastikan tidak ada kenakalan yang dipertontonkan atau pemikiran yang merusak dibicarakan. Tetapi ketika penyensoran teater akhirnya berakhir, pesta besar-besaran diadakan. Drama musik Hair dipentaskan di West End, termasuk adegan pembuka yang mengejutkan mata.

Musikal rock hippi tersebut berisi adegan di mana aktornya menanggalkan pakaian di akhir bagian pertama dan muncul bersama di bahwa seprei raksasa. Hair segera menjadi populer, meskipun adegan telanjang, pemakaian obat dan pesan anti-Perang Vietnam membuat marah kritikus.

'Pengawal ketidaksenonohan'

Pertunjukan lain yang menggunakan berakhirnya penyensoran adalah Oh! Calcutta!, yang pada tahun 1969 mementaskan tarian erotik, setelah semua pemerannya menanggalkan pakaian di bagian pertama. Drama ini dibuat kritikus teater Kenneth Tynan untuk menghasilkan uang. Dia melibatkan Samuel Beckett, Sam Shepard dan John Lennon untuk lebih memberikan warna avant-garde pada ceritanya. Pada saat itu adegannya sudah dipandang kuno, bukan lagi suatu pembebasan seksual. Tetapi pertunjukan ini tetap saja menciptakan skandal serius karena dipandang pengamat konservatif sebagai gejala kemunduran moral tahun 60-an.

Image copyright Rex Features Image caption Pejuang moralitas Mary Whitehouse tersinggung dengan teater buatan Howard Brenton, The Romans in Britain, yang menampilkan adegan pemerkosaan pria.

Muncul tuntutan agar pertunjukan ditutup, di bawah pimpinan Dowager Lady Birdwood dari kelompok kanan, yang menyatakannya 'sangat jorok'. Polisi yang menyembunyikan identitasnya, menonton bagian telanjang sampai tiga kali dan mendesak Jaksa Agung untuk menutup pertunjukan. Tetapi tim ahli yang terdiri dari kepala sekolah perempuan, pendeta dan seorang profesor hukum, secara diam-diam dikirim untuk menonton pertunjukan. Mereka memandang bagian telanjangnya tidak merusak. Pertunjukan boleh dilanjutkan. Dan terus dipentaskan selama sepuluh tahun di West End.

Tetapi teater tidak lama kemudian menghadapi pengecam yang vokal lewat Mary Whitehouse, yang pada permulaan tahun 1970-an memimpin perjuangan menentang masyarakat yang permisif. Tahun 1980, Whitehouse menjadikan teater The Romans in Britain-nya Howard Brenton sebagai sasaran, Pertunjukkan itu memperlihatkan adegan singkat pemerkosaan pendeta Druid oleh tentara Romawi.

Pengawal ketidaksenonohan tidak mempermasalahkan drama yang dipentaskan di National Theatre itu, tetapi Whitehouse (yang bahkan menolak menontonnya) tetap kukuh. Sutradara Michael Bogdanov dituduh ""mementaskan adegan sangat jorok"" di panggung, dengan menggunakan Sexual Offences Act tahun 1956. Tetapi pengadilan di Old Bailey tahun 1982 menolak kasus itu. Seorang saksi mengatakan melihat ""ujung penis"", tetapi ternyata dia duduk jauh di belakang sehingga tidak menyadari yang dilihat adalah ibu jari.

'Viagra teatrikal'

Para aktor senang menggunakan telanjang di panggung untuk membuat orang terkejut. Ini adalah kesempatan bagi mereka untuk menunjukkan mereka bersedia melakukan segalanya demi sebuah peran. King Lear adalah peran keagamaan yang dalam produksi teater modern seringkali menampilkan para aktor yang telanjang sama sekali saat mengatakan off, off you lendings, come unbutton here. Ian Holm yang memulai hal ini, telanjang pada produksi Richard Eyre di National pada tahun 1997. Banyak orang membicarakannya. Para penonton menikmati kesempatan menonton humor penis pada tragedi buatan Shakespeare.

Image copyright Equus Image caption Peran seksual mengubah reputasi bintang anak-anak, itulah yang dialami Daniel Radcliffe lewat Equus.

Ian McKellen juga telanjang pada produksi RSC di tahun 2007. Kegaduhan media yang terjadi membuktikan kita seringkali lebih tertarik pada alat kelamin aktor dibandingkan akting mereka. Germaine Greer menulis artikel yang mendukung pengungkapan ""alat kelamin yang memesona"" sebagai satu-satunya adegan yang diingat dari produksi Trevor Nunn.

Menanggalkan pakaian masih merupakan cara bagi aktor untuk menunjukkan keseriusannya. Misalnya Daniel Radcliffe yang dipuji pada tahun 2007 karena telanjang pada drama Peter Shaffer berjudul Equus ketika dia baru berumur 17 tahun. Ini adalah tentang Radcliffe meninggalkan citra Harry Potter, selain penanggalan pakaian dalam. Peran seksual mengubah reputasi bintang film anak-anak.

Image copyright Tristram Kenton Image caption Charles Spencer dari Daily Telegraph menggambarkan akting Nicole Kidman dalam The Blue Room sebagai ""Viagra teatrikal yang sebenarnya"".

Produksi panggung Inggris yang seksual juga terbukti ""mengubah kehidupan"" Nicole Kidman. Dia muncul di Donmar Warehouse pada tahun 1998 lewat The Blue Room, adaptasi David Hare terhadap karya Le Ronde. Bintang muda Hollywood ini harus berpakaian di panggung. Pertunjukan ini sangat laku, tiketnya sampai dijual senilai 1.000 atau Rp18 juta, hanya untuk menonton punggung telanjangnya. Kritikus Telegraph, Charles Spencer, menggambarkan aktingnya sebagai ""benar-benar Viagra teatrikal"". Aktor yang tampil bersama Kidman, Iain Glen, jarang disebut-sebut ketelanjangannya.

Anda mungkin berpikir orang Inggris terobsesi. The Full Monty dan Calendar Girls memberikan kesempatan bagi wanita dan pria setengah baya untuk telanjang, pertama di film, kemudian di panggung. Tiba-tiba, memperlihatkan kulit telanjang dipandang menghibur, dipandang jenaka, cerdik dan digemari pesta menjelang pernikahan dan para wisatawan. Gary Barlow baru-baru ini mementaskan versi musikal Calendar Girls.

Politik

Telanjang masih bisa menjadi alat yang kuat. Banyak produksi yang memperlihatkan bagian tubuh telanjang untuk memperlakukannya sebagai alat politik, identitas dan feminisme. Di tahun 1980-an, seniman pertunjukan legendaris Amerika Serikat, Karen Finley, menjadi terkenal karena pertunjukan telanjangnya, yang membicarakan perkosaan, AIDS, inses dan subjek tabu lainnya. Dia seringkali menutupi tubuh telanjangnya dengan cokelat dan madu. Adegan seperti ini dipandang berlebihan oleh banyak orang bahkan pada tahun 90-an. Pendanaan National Endowment for the Arts yang diterima Finley dicabut karena dia dianggap bertindak tidak senonoh pada tahun 1990. Langkah ini dipandang sebagai skandal penyensoran.

Image copyright REX Image caption Versi musikal Mrs Henderson Presents secara umum direspon positif para kritikus.

Kita lebih bisa menerimanya sekarang. Pertunjukan komedi Adrienne Truscott tahun 2013 berjudul Asking for It memperlihatkannya hanya memakai jaket denim dan sepatu hak tinggi. Telanjang menambahkan faktor untuk mengejutkan, tetapi juga menekankan pemerkosaan sama sekali tidak ada hubungannya dengan pakaian yang dikenakan perempuan.

Dan pada tahun 2009, pertunjukan feminis Nic Green, Trilogy, mengaburkan batasan antara penonton dengan aktor. Selain menanggalkan pakaian, dia juga mengajak penonton perempuan untuk melakukan hal yang sama dan ikut serta menari di panggung untuk merayakan tubuh perempuan dalam berbagai bentuk dan ukuran.

Apakah itu untuk mendukung kepolosan perempuan dewasa panggung atau merayakan ketelanjangan, sepertinya pertunjukan teater Inggris masih belum menunjukkan tanda-tanda akan menutupi tubuhnya.",[]

bbc.com,,Museum of Lost Objects: The Genie of Nimrud,"['Bbc News', 'Kanishk Tharoor', 'Maryam Maruf']","Image copyright Brooklyn Museum

Three thousand years ago, a genie graced the walls of an Assyrian palace. Then, probably about 20 years ago, it disappeared, only to re-emerge in London. Since 2002 it's been languishing in police vaults at Scotland Yard, because of difficulties determining the legal owner.

The genie is a powerfully built man, with wings sprouting from his back. About 2m high, it is carved in relief on a stone panel, holding a pine cone, and facing a pattern that represents the tree of life. The genie symbolised both protection and fertility - its role was to safeguard and replenish the ancient kingdom of Assyria.

It was a design particularly popular with the Assyrian king, Ashurnasirpal II, who came to the throne in 883 BC, and made Nimrud his new capital.

""Ashurnasirpal and his artists were really the first to decorate many of the rooms in the public spaces within the palace,"" says archaeologist Augusta McMahon, lecturer at the University of Cambridge.

""One of the key symbols that appeared over and over was this genie or protective spirit. Because in the minds of the ancient Assyrians it's an enormously powerful motif, it can't hurt to have a further fertility symbol somewhere in the room.""

Protective genies came in all sorts of shapes and sizes. The genie in the photograph above is very similar but not identical to the one now in the hands of British police. Others had the bodies of men but the heads of ferocious-looking birds and a feathered hairstyle, still others were a combination of man and fish.

Our particular genie had copious amounts of curly hair and a long beard. ""The really big crazy-looking hair and the massive beard were part of making him really stand out,"" says McMahon, who also draws attention to the ""little fringed outfit that shows off these incredibly muscular legs"".

The impact of all the genies side by side in the palace would have been to convey the strength and virility of the Assyrian empire.

Across the belly of the genie was a smattering of cuneiform in the now extinct language, Akkadian. The text is what's known as Ashurnasirpal's ""standard inscription"". It lays out in minute detail his many kingly accomplishments - from treading on the necks of foes to being ""king of the universe"" - and was carved on many of the reliefs and sculptures that filled the halls of his palace at Nimrud.

Image copyright Brooklyn Museum Image caption A cuneiform text written in Akkadian on an ancient stone carving

""It's my favourite ancient archaeological site,"" says Mark Altaweel, an Iraqi-American archaeologist whose ancestors come from Mosul - not far from Nimrud.

""You did see the reliefs in place, you can see the rooms. Even the ancient floors were sort of wobbly, and in some ways that gave it the ancient feel. You got a sense of what a palace was like when you walked in there.""

Sometimes, however, even protective spirits need protecting. At some point since Nimrud's excavation, this genie relief was moved into a storage room from where it disappeared. It's believed to have been taken in the 1990s during the chaos of the first Gulf war, but no-one knows for sure.

The genie's whereabouts were completely unknown for about 10 years. Eventually in 2002, just before the second Gulf war, it turned up in London - one of the world's largest antiquities markets.

Scotland Yard's Art and Antiques Unit went to collect the genie, but it's unclear who legally owns it, so for the last 14 years it has been locked up in a secure storage unit belonging to London's Metropolitan Police.

""The problem is that the burden of proof on objects, when they are looted, is on the authorities to show that it really was removed illegally,"" says Altaweel.

This can be a challenge.

Looters sometimes lie about an object's country of origin, and move it through a variety of transit points. It may change hands many times and some of the sellers may insist on remaining anonymous.

""So the genie is basically in a kind of limbo state,"" says Altaweel.

Even though it appears to be part of a documented collection that was in Nimrud for 3,000 years, at present it seems unlikely to ever return to Iraq.

At some point in its journey, the genie was badly damaged. His head, wings, and upper body are still visible, but gone are his legs and much of Ashurnasirpal's cuneiform inscription. These may have been hacked away when the genie was first taken, or disposed of en route to London - it's not clear. But it is still highly valuable.

""We hear that just the head was going for 3.5m (almost $5m) in 2003 prices,"" says Altaweel.

""So imagine the value it would get today, and there are people who are willing to pay those prices. There has always been an interest in Nimrud.""

Altaweel was in Nimrud just weeks after the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 and saw for himself fresh signs of looting.

""The site guard told me there was a gunfight that happened, with some bullets hitting the reliefs,"" he says. Some of the panels depicting genies and other figures had been cut out - the head would be missing, with the body and legs still in place.

Image copyright Mark Altaweel Image caption A relief split into parts by looters

Image copyright Mark Altaweel Image caption Only fragments of this relief remain on site

The awful irony is that the looting of the genie now at Scotland Yard may have saved it from complete destruction. After seizing Mosul in 2014, the so-called Islamic State group began destroying sites in and around the city - including, the following year, Nimrud.

This has prompted debates about the thorny issue of repatriation. Some have argued that it might have been better if more of the Middle East's archaeological riches had been taken from the region during the era of European imperialism. To them, the iconoclasm of the would-be caliphate seemed to justify, in retrospect, the cavalier way in which Western archaeologists and collectors relieved the Middle East of its cultural heritage in the 19th and early 20th Centuries.

And yet for many people outside the West, it remains a source of grievance that so much of their past sits in the halls and basements of museums in Paris and Berlin, London and New York. Westerners can more easily enjoy the cultural history of Iraq than Iraqis themselves.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Some treasures from Nimrud now held in the British Museum

But while looters have plundered Iraqi museums and still threaten historical sites, the looted objects do not always end up being smuggled abroad.

Mark Altaweel was at the museum in Sulaymaniyah in Iraqi Kurdistan five years ago, when he got chatting to an American Kurdish man. Only after the man had left did Altaweel realise that a transaction had just taken place.

The visitor had offered to sell a series of cuneiform tablets and other objects and the museum at the time had a no-questions-asked policy, so it bought them.

""At first glance you think that's a horrible policy,"" says Altaweel. ""But it did actually prevent them from leaving Iraq proper.""

The visitor's haul included something amazing - a chapter of the Gilgamesh epic, the original blockbuster adventure, with monster battles, the search for immortality, divine kings, and even a whole section on how the wrathful gods flooded the Earth (a scenario that would appear again in the later biblical tale of Noah). Gilgamesh is humanity's earliest story. It marks that moment when gods and humans stepped out of the murky unknown and into the sharp relief of narrative.

""As soon as they saw that there's a text that talks about the Gilgamesh story, their immediate reaction was to buy this thing,"" says Altaweel. ""They understood that this was extremely rare.""

Image copyright Farouk al Rawi

One of the key scenes in the Gilgamesh epic is the momentous encounter between the hero Gilgamesh and the monster Humbaba, described as a hideous ogre - his ""roar is a flood, his mouth is death and his breath is fire!""

This beast of the wild can generally be found roaming the beautiful Cedar Forest. His primary aim is to terrify men and it's up to the brave, demi-god Gilgamesh and his sidekick Enkidu to vanquish Humbaba and rid the forest of his ugly tyranny. But what's remarkable about the Gilgamesh tablet recovered at the Sulaymaniyah museum is that it shows Humbaba in a different light.

""Where Humbaba came and went there was a track, the paths were in good order and the way was well trodden,"" the tablet reads.

""Through all the forest a bird began to sing: A wood pigeon was moaning, a turtle dove calling in answer. Monkey mothers sing aloud, a youngster monkey shrieks: like a band of musicians and drummers daily they bash out a rhythm in the presence of Humbaba.""

In this version of the story, Humbaba is beloved of the gods and a kind of king in the palace of the forest. Monkeys are his heralds, birds his courtiers, and his entire throne room breathes with the heady aroma of cedar resin.

Gilgamesh and Enkidu, meanwhile, are aggressors, ecological thieves. They come to Humbaba's forest to take its timber back to their treeless homeland in Mesopotamia. In this newly discovered tablet of the epic, we find - remarkably - a sense that the heroes of the tale were in the wrong.

Image copyright Alamy Image caption Gilgamesh and Enkidu slay a bull in this painting by E. Wallcousins

""Enkidu opened his mouth to speak, saying to Gilgamesh: 'My friend, we have reduced the forest to a wasteland. In your might you slew the guardian, what was this wrath of yours that you went trampling the forest?'""

This sense of remorse is particularly strong in the Sulaymaniyah tablet, but traces of it also exist in other versions of the Gilgamesh epic. In so many other ancient tales, the Anglo-Saxon Beowulf for example, we find a black-and-white world, a clear binary of good and evil. In Gilgamesh there is plenty of grey. The hero is faced with the moral consequences of his actions. There is so much destruction in the achievement of his greatness.

Intentionally and unintentionally, modern-day combatants in Iraq and Syria are destroying precious records of antiquity, and more objects like the genie and cuneiform tablets will inevitably slip on to the black market. So, it's worth celebrating the rare recoveries of these artefacts.

""It's a good and bad thing. It's bad that it was looted, it's bad that it had to be purchased. But it's good because at least it stays in the country of Iraq,"" says Altaweel.

""It's one of these things where Western scholars actually have to come to Iraq to see this and study this tablet. So it's good that at least something of significance stays in the country. Iraqis need to see these things too, ultimately these countries need stability, and stability equals economy, equals tourism, equals the objects being back there.""

War makes exiles out of people and cultural artefacts alike. It is a small victory, but a victory nonetheless, when an antiquity like the tablet of Gilgamesh can endure and remain in Iraq.

Ashurnasirpal's genie, however, seems destined to stay far from its old home. Once it guarded the palace of its king. Now it is guarded by British police, in an obscure basement in a foreign country.

El rey Jorge V transmitio el primer mensaje de Navidad por radio en el que se dirigio a los ""hombres y mujeres que estan tan aislados por la nieve y por los desiertos, que solo los pueden alcanzar las voces por el aire"".

En 1938 se crearon los primeros servicios en otros idiomas (arabe y espanol).

En el inicio de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, la BBC comenzo a transmitir en siete idiomas, y gano reputacion por su vision precisa e imparcial en tiempos de conflicto.

Hacia el final de la guerra, ya existian 45 servicios en otros idiomas y el servicio en ingles transmitia a todo el mundo 24 horas al dia.

En 1940, lo que se conocia como el ""Servicio del Imperio"" cambio su nombre a ""Servicios Externos"", y se traslado a Bush House, en el centro de Londres, la sede que ocupo hasta 2012, ano en que se mudo a nuevas y modernas dependencias en New Broadcasting House.

En los anos de la posguerra, la llegada del transistor disparo el numero de radioescuchas en todo el mundo.

Los ""Servicios Externos"" fueron rebautizados como ""el Servicio Mundial de la BBC"" en 1988.

Como se financia el Servicio Mundial de la BBC?

Hasta el 1 de abril de 2014, el presupuesto del Servicio Mundial provenia de una subvencion parlamentaria administrada por la cancilleria britanica.

Desde esa fecha, comenzo a financiarse como el resto de la BBC, a traves de una licencia que debe ser pagada por todos los propietarios de televisores en Gran Bretana.

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,Cuales son los 6 paises mas desiguales de America Latina?,"['Marcelo Justo', 'Bbc Mundo']","Image copyright Getty Image caption En Honduras, 64,5% de la poblacion vive en situacion de pobreza.

America Latina no es la region mas pobre del planeta, pero compite con Africa por el titulo de la mas desigual.

La base de datos del Banco Mundial, actualizada el pasado diciembre, muestra que los primeros cinco paises en el ranking de la desigualdad son africanos, seguidos por cinco latinoamericanos.

Entre los 14 mas desiguales a nivel global figuran Honduras (6), Colombia (7), Brasil (8), Guatemala (9), Panama (10) y Chile (14).

El Banco Mundial utilizo el coeficiente Gini para medir la desigualdad en base a dos variables absolutas: el cero (todos tienen el mismo ingreso o perfecta igualdad) y el 1 (una persona concentra todo el ingreso y el resto no tiene nada o desigualdad absoluta).

Una de las sorpresas es que paises de ingreso mediano bajo, normalmente identificados como pobres (Honduras, Guatemala), tienen practicamente el mismo nivel de desigualdad que otros de ingresos medio-altos o altos (Chile).

Image copyright Getty Image caption Algunos paises suman a la pobreza los problemas de la desigualdad.

El economista de la Universidad de Quilmes y de AEDA (Asociacion de Economia para el Desarrollo de Argentina) German Herrera Bartis senala que es necesario distinguir entre pobreza y desigualdad en este grupo heterogeneo.

""La pobreza se vincula con el ingreso medio de una sociedad. La desigualdad con la distribucion. No hay una relacion lineal entre ambos. Por eso se puede tener paises pobres muy desiguales, pero tambien paises de ingresos medianos o de altos ingresos, como Brasil o Estados Unidos, con altos niveles de desigualdad"", indico a BBC Mundo.

Honduras

Segun el Banco Mundial, Honduras tiene un 64,5% de la poblacion en situacion de pobreza y un 42.6% en extrema pobreza (menos de 2,5 dolares al dia).

En terminos del coeficiente Gini, la desigualdad es del 53,7.

""Este coeficiente hay que ubicarlo en la serie de paises para darse una idea. El pais mas igualitario, Noruega, tiene un indice de 25,9 y el mas desigual, Sudafrica, un 63,4"", indico a BBC Mundo Herrera Bartis.

El Banco Mundial comparo ingresos, pero una desigualdad similar se percibe en terminos de acceso a la salud o a la educacion.

En el indice de Desarrollo Humano de Naciones Unidas que mide conjuntamente ingreso, expectativa de vida y de educacion de un pais, Honduras pierde siete puntos cuando se pondera el impacto de la desigualdad en las mediciones.

Los seis paises mas desiguales de America Latina Medicion segun el coeficiente de Gini 53,7 Honduras

53,5 Colombia

52,9 Brasil

52,4 Guatemala

51,7 Panama

50,5 Chile

La disparidad es tal que los ninos mas pobres solo acceden a cuatro anos promedio de educacion mientras que los mas ricos tienen 10 anos y mas, cifras que se profundizan cuando se compara la desigualdad en zonas rurales y urbanas.

Guatemala

El otro pais con ingreso mediano bajo es Guatemala, noveno a nivel mundial y cuarto en la region.

Segun el Banco Mundial, Guatemala consiguio una reduccion de la pobreza del 5% a principios de este siglo, pero para 2011 los indices volvieron a subir hasta llegar al 53,7% con una situacion particularmente dificil en casi la mitad de los municipios rurales, donde ocho de cada 10 personas son pobres.

Esta situacion no se puede achacar a la falta de crecimiento.

Con el parentesis del estallido financiero 2008-2009, Guatemala aumento su Producto Interno Bruto (PIB) mas de un 3% anual en lo que va del siglo.

A pesar de esto la desigualdad sigue siendo una de las mas elevadas de la region: el 52,4%, apenas unos puntos por detras de Honduras.

Image copyright Getty Image caption Las disparidades aumentan cuando se compara a los habitantes de las zonas rurales con los que viven en las ciudades.

Segun el Banco Mundial uno de los problemas mas graves es la escasa recaudacion fiscal, ""el menor porcentaje de ingresos publicos en el mundo en relacion con el tamano de su economia"".

""Hay un circulo vicioso de la pobreza y la desigualdad. Una sociedad de bajos ingresos, de baja recaudacion y muy desigual no genera el nivel de demanda que se requiere para atraer inversiones que hagan crecer la economia"", senala Herrea Bartis.

Colombia

Entre los paises latinoamericanos de ingresos medio y altos, Colombia se encuentra en primer lugar en niveles de desigualdad, apenas por debajo de Honduras, a pesar de que, en terminos de PIB, los colombianos estan 74 puestos por encima de los hondurenos.

En Colombia el 10% de la poblacion mas rica del pais gana cuatro veces mas que el 40% mas pobre.

A pesar de que la pobreza ha caido desde 2002 en adelante, la desigualdad se mantiene constante.

En el indice de desarrollo humano de la ONU, Colombia pierde diez puntos una vez que se lo pondera en terminos de desigualdad de acceso a la salud, la educacion y bajos salarios.

Las senales de desigualdad se extienden por todo el tejido economico-social.

Image copyright Getty Image caption La desigualdad se acrecienta en muchos casos al tomar en cuenta el acceso a los servicios mas basicos.

Segun una investigacion de Ana Maria Ibanez, decana de Economia de la Universidad de Los Andes, en 2010 un 77,6% de la tierra estaba en manos de 13,7% de los propietarios.

Aplicando el coeficiente Gini a la distribucion de la tierra, esta proporcion da uno de los indices mas altos de desigualdad: un 0,86.

Brasil

Octavo a nivel mundial, tercero en la region, la mayor economia de America Latina, Brasil es uno de los casos mas flagrantes de convivencia entre una reduccion de la pobreza y un aumento de la desigualdad.

Si en 2006 el 5% mas rico acaparaba el 40% del ingreso total, en 2012 habia aumentado esta participacion hasta llegar al 44% a pesar de las politicas sociales del gobierno y el impacto del plan Fome Cero (Hambre Cero) que saco a 40 millones de personas de la pobreza.

Esta desigualdad seria mas abismal aun si se contara toda la riqueza no declarada en un pais que tiene una evasion fiscal del 13,4% y una economia en la sombra del 39%.

Mucho mas dificil de ocultar, es la disparidad de acceso a salud y educacion, algo que se visibilizo a nivel global en las protestas que precedieron a la Copa del Mundo 2014.

No sorprende que, una vez que se incorpora la desigualdad a la evaluacion de sus indicadores de ingreso, salud y educacion, Brasil registre una caida de 20 puntos en terminos de Desarrollo Humano de la ONU.

Image copyright Getty Image caption En Brasil, hubo protestas en contra del Mundial de Futbol debido a las dificultades economicas que vive una parte de la sociedad.

Si se toma en cuenta que el ano pasado el PIB se desplomo en un 3,8%, la situacion no luce promisoria.

""Los procesos economicos contractivos acompanados de ajuste fiscal golpean a los que menos tienen y, por lo general, aumentan tanto la pobreza como la desigualdad"", indico Herrera Bartis.

Panama

En terminos de caida o desaceleracion economica Panama es una de las excepciones de la region.

Con un crecimiento promedio del 7% en los ultimos 10 anos, no se vio afectada por la caida de los precios de las materias primas: su PIB aumento mas del 6% en 2015.

Pero una cosa es la vida en esa opulenta ""Little Manhattan"" que puede ser la Ciudad de Panama y otra la de las barriadas o el interior del pais.

Los ingresos reflejan el abismo que separa a los rascacielos y las casas de precarios techos de chapa: el coeficiente Gini alcanza el 51,7.

Pero no son el unico factor.

Image copyright Getty Image caption Pese al crecimiento economico de la ultima decada, en Panama son visibles las desigualdades.

Un 25% de la poblacion panamena no tiene servicios sanitarios, un 5% no tiene agua potable, un 11% sufre de desnutricion y otro 11% vive en casas con pisos de tierra.

En el indice de desarrollo humano de la ONU Panama pierde 20 puntos cuando se incluye el impacto de la desigualdad en la medicion.

Chile

Es la economia regional que mas ha crecido desde los anos 80 y suele ser encomiada como modelo virtuoso para el resto de la region.

Sin embargo, el informe de 2015 de la OCDE, que agrupa a 34 naciones de altos ingresos, subraya los niveles de desigualdad en la sociedad chilena.

""Chile sigue siendo una sociedad altamente desigual en terminos de ingresos, educacion y bienestar. El mercado laboral muestra una dualidad que redunda en una muy desigual distribucion salarial"", senala el informe.

En efecto, el 10% mas rico tiene un ingreso 27 veces superior al 10% mas pobre.

Asi, en la medicion de desigualdad del Banco Mundial, Chile aparece en el decimocuarto lugar a nivel mundial y en el sexto de las economias de la region.

Debido a la limitada intervencion estatal, la situacion empeora cuando se considera tambien el acceso a la salud y la educacion.

Image copyright Getty Image caption Pese a ser un pais de ingresos altos, la desigualdad persiste en Chile.

En el indice de Desarrollo Humano de la ONU, Chile pierde 13 puntos una vez que se suma la desigualdad conjunta de ingresos, acceso a salud y educacion.

Sin embargo, Herrera Bartis senala dos reformas que estan mejorando la situacion.

""En la primera presidencia de Bachelet se introdujo la jubilacion solidaria para los que no habian contribuido lo suficiente para una pension. En su actual mandato, es la ley de inclusion escolar por la que se busca avanzar progresivamente hacia una mayor gratuidad del sistema. Pero la foto de Chile es de una economia profundamente desigual"", senalo a BBC Mundo Herrera Bartis.",[]

bbc.com,,US 'quizzes Islamic State chemical arms expert in Iraq',[],"Image copyright None Image caption Islamic State fighters control larges parts of northern Iraq and Syria

A chemical weapons expert from the Islamic State (IS) group in Iraq has been captured by US special forces and is being questioned, reports say.

The man was once a specialist in chemical and biological weapons for Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader overthrown by the US invasion in 2003, Iraqi and US sources told US media.

Named as Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, he was reportedly seized last month.

In a statement to the BBC, the Pentagon would not confirm his capture.

However, its spokesman confirmed US special forces had begun operations in Iraq - part of a more aggressive strategy against IS.

The man has already told interrogators how IS loaded mustard gas into shells, US sources told the New York Times.

Last month, sources at the global chemical watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), announced that sulphur mustard had been used last year in an attack on Kurdish forces in Iraq blamed on IS.

If confirmed, it would be the first known use of chemical weapons in Iraq since the fall of Saddam.

Banned weapon

Mr Afari was identified as a former employee of the Military Industrialisation Authority, which functioned under Saddam, who used poison gas against Iraq's Kurdish community in the 1980s.

Unnamed US defence sources told the New York Times Mr Afari was being held in Irbil, a Kurdish stronghold in northern Iraq.

He is being questioned about IS plans to use mustard gas, which is banned under international law, in Iraq and Syria, the paper says.

The alleged IS weapons expert reportedly gave his captors details of how the group had weaponised mustard gas into powdered form and loaded it into artillery shells.

One defence official quoted by the paper said the gas was not concentrated enough to kill anyone but that it could maim people.

Mustard gas, which is liquid at ambient temperature, is a powerful irritant and blistering agent which causes severe damage to the skin, eyes and respiratory system and internal organs.

The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited the prisoner after it was notified of his capture by US officials, the paper adds. No details were given.

Two unnamed Iraqi intelligence sources quoted by the Associated Press news agency described Mr Afari as the head of the IS unit trying to develop chemical weapons.

IS leaders targeted

A Pentagon spokesman told the BBC on Wednesday: ""I cannot confirm these reports.

""What I can tell you is, and as the [Defense] Secretary [Ashton Carter] said recently, the Expeditionary Targeting Force [ETF] has begun operations in Iraq, but we will not discuss the details of those missions when it risks compromising operational security.

""One of the goals of the ETF is to capture ISIL [IS] leaders. Any detention would be short-term and coordinated with Iraqi authorities.""

US officials announced last week that a US commando force had captured an IS leader in Iraq without giving his name.

IS, a fundamentalist Sunni Muslim group also known as Daesh, is notorious for its brutal methods in gaining territory in Iraq and Syria.

It claimed a number of devastating gun and bomb attacks outside the region in 2015, notably the attacks on Paris and downing of a Russian airliner over Egypt.

Last week, the UK's national head of counter-terrorism policing, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, warned that IS might be planning a ""spectacular"" attack in the UK.",[]

The Chilean general who led an army death squad in the aftermath of the 1973 military coup has died aged 94.

Gen Sergio Arellano Stark was the commander of the infamous ""Caravan of Death"", responsible for the killing of at least 75 political prisoners.

The army unit took opponents of Gen Pinochet's regime from jails and executed them by firing squad.

The squad spent two months flying between Santiago and the north of Chile on the orders of Pinochet.

The country's military leader was reportedly annoyed that some commanders in provincial towns had been ""soft"" on political opponents.

Image copyright AP Image caption Pinochet said there would be no mercy for ""extremists""

Arellano and seven other army officials were sentenced in 2008 to six years in prison for their crimes.

But Arellano was spared jail because he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.

He died peacefully in a nursing home in the early hours of Wednesday.

According to official figures, 40,018 people were victims of human rights abuses between 1973 and 1990 and 3,065 were killed or disappeared.

The democratically-elected socialist President, Salvador Allende, was killed inside the presidential palace during the coup on 11 September 1973.

Pinochet stepped down in 1990 but retained the post of commander-in-chief of the army for another eight years.

He was arrested months later during an unofficial visit to London, after an extradition request from Spain.

Pinochet was allowed to return to Chile in 2000, but in 2002 the Supreme Court ruled that he was mentally unfit to stand trial for his crimes. He died in 20016, aged 91.",[]

bbc.com,,Deutsche Bank and UBS lose bonus tax case,[],"Image copyright PA

The UK Supreme Court has ruled Deutsche Bank and UBS should pay taxes on bonuses paid to their investment bankers.

The bonuses were paid to staff via offshore accounts in the form of shares to avoid attracting income tax and national insurance in 2004.

The banks had argued that restrictions placed on the payouts meant they were not liable for tax.

But a judge said the UBS restrictions were ""completely arbitrary"".

Under tax rules at the time, shares attracted only a 10% capital gains tax rather than income tax and National Insurance contributions.

In the case of Deutsche Bank bonus shares were awarded to staff through a Cayman Islands company, known as Dark Blue Investments.

To qualify for the bonus payout staff only had to avoid being dismissed, or not resign within six weeks of receiving their bonus shares.

After a period of time had elapsed the shares could then be redeemed by the employees as cash.

'Unlikely' scenario

In the case of UBS, the restriction placed on the share payout involved ""a specified rise in the FTSE 100 index"" over a three week period.

That scenario was deemed by the Supreme Court as ""unlikely to occur"".

The UBS scheme was described by Lord Justice Reed as ""completely arbitrary"" and ""having no business or commercial rationale"".

UBS has already repaid 50m in taxes, with much of that retrieved from those who benefitted from the bank's scheme.

Business Secretary Sajid Javid was a managing director at Deutsche Bank when the Dark Blue Investments scheme was in operation, having joined the bank in 2000.

A spokesman for Mr Javid said: ""This is a matter between Deutsche Bank and HMRC.

""Sajid Javid was paid with all tax deducted already. He received no benefit whatsoever from this scheme and all taxes due have been paid.""",[]

Sepasang bayi kembar di Vietnam dipastikan memiliki dua ayah yang berbeda, seperti disampaikan asosiasi genetika setempat kepada BBC.

Kembar tersebut sudah menjalani uji coba DNA setelah keluarga melihat kedua bayi tampak berbeda satu sama lain.

Kasus kembar dengan dua ayah yang dikenal sebagai heteropaternal superfecundation tergolong amat langka dan tidak banyak diketahui masyarakat umum.

Hal itu terjadi karena sel telur seorang perempuan dibuahi oleh sperma dua orang pria dalam selang waktu yang singkat.

Profesor Le Dinh Luong -presiden Asosiasi Genetika Vietnam yang melakukan uji coba DNA- mengatakan hasil pemeriksaan '100% benar' untuk kembar, yang menurutnya 'amat jarang terjadi'.

""Tak sampai 10 kasus yang diketahui tentang kembar dari ayah berbeda di seluruh dunia. Mungkin ada kasus-kasus lain, namun orang tua atau kembar tersebut tidak tahu atau tidak mau mengungkapkannya,"" jelas Prof Le kepada wartawan BBC Vietnam, Nga Pham.

Dia menolak untuk memberikan rincian lebih lanjut karena kerahasiaan pasien namun menambahkan 'tempat, nama, dan waktu' yang dilaporkan oleh sejumlah media tidak benar.

Donald Trump continued his march towards the Republican Party nomination in the US by taking three more primaries. And where there's a Trump win, there's a social media reaction.

This time it was #ifTrumpwins that gathered momentum, bringing hope and levity to the serious world of campaign politics.

Or, that was the intention when Comedy Central's Midnight programme incited its 500,000 followers to play with the hashtag.

Image copyright @midnight

Over 10,500 tweets mention both @midnight and #iftrumpwins, making up nearly 40% of the original tweets on the hashtag.

The trend peaked at 7,468 tweets in the hour 0500-0600GMT with the fearful perspective of Dubai-based EDM producer Shuja Rabbani a top tweet.

Two tweets from @PoliticsJim helped drive the trend, garnering more than 6,000 retweets between them. Both involved satirising Trump's campaign slogan of ""Make America Great Again"".

One involves a playful take on popular American painter and TV personality Bob Ross, whose PBS programme The Joy of Painting brought him worldwide fame in the 1980s and 1990s.

Another saw Jim subverting the slogan with cake, transforming it to ""Bake America Cake Again"" - a sentiment all Americans passionate about patisserie can get behind, regardless of politics.

Can you describe this VR experience?

Diving through kelp forests or on the deep ocean are amazing experiences. Through these short films were attempting to capture that experience in virtual reality.

Is Virtual Reality a good fit for Natural History programmes?



Absolutely! The aim of Natural History production is escapism, immersion and bringing the natural world to peoples living rooms. With VR starting to become available through YouTube as cardboard, as well as 360 degree video, weve tried to produce a series of short films that take the audience to Monterey Bay, to experience some its amazing environments and wildlife.

What are you hoping it will achieve?

We want the audience to experience something theyd never see on a flat screen, and come away with an whole new understanding of the natural world.

How did you film this?

Where to start! We shot with a Google / GoPro Jump rig and a 360heroes underwater rig. We also cobbled together stabilisation rigs, which would be (mostly) hidden from the camera.

What did you learn from working with VR?

We are just starting to understand how to make VR experiences really. YouTube is still very low bandwidth and screens are low refresh rates (for VR at least), but this will change but as these improve, we hope to be ready to make better films.",[]

Um tribunal americano decidiu que a reporter de TV americana Erin Andrews recebera uma indenizacao de US$ 55 milhoes apos ser filmada nua em um quarto de hotel sem saber.

Apos um dia de deliberacoes, o juri decidiu que a culpa era 51% do autor do video. A outra parte da indenizacao (US$ 27 milhoes) sera paga pelos responsaveis pelo hotel.

Andrews, de 37 anos, reporter da Fox Sports, foi filmada em 2008 pelo olho magico da porta do quarto por Michael David Barrett. Publicado na internet, o video se tornou viral.

Ela chorou quando o veredito foi anunciado e abracou seus advogados e sua familia.

Depois, em uma declaracao no Twitter, agradeceu a Corte, ao juri, aos advogados e a familia.

""Fiquei honrada pelo apoio de vitimas por todo o mundo"", disse.

""Eles me ajudaram a me manifestar e responsabilizar aqueles que tem como trabalho proteger a seguranca e privacidade das pessoas.""

Andrews processou Barrett e as duas empresas donas do hotel onde ela foi filmada, em Nashville, por US$ 75 milhoes. Ele estava hospedada em um hotel perto da Universidade Vanderbilt, para cobrir uma partida de futebol americano.

Barrett, executivo de uma empresa de seguros de Chicago, admitiu que filmou Andrews e disse que fez isso para ganhar dinheiro. Ele postou as imagens online apos o site de fofocas de celebridades TMZ se recusar a pagar por elas.

Image copyright Getty Image caption Barrett em foto de 2009; ele foi condenado por perseguicao

Barrett se declarou culpado por perseguir Andrews. Ele se hospedou no quarto ao lado do dela e modificou o olho magico do quarto para fazer videos com nudes dela. Ele foi condenado a dois anos e meio de prisao.

Coube entao ao juri decidir se a empresa dona do hotel, West End Hotel Partners, e a antiga operadora, Windsor Capital Group, tambem eram culpadas.

Ela acusou as empresas de negligencia por permitir que ele soubesse qual seria o quarto dela para reservar o quarto vizinho.

Barrett, no entanto, disse que fez tudo sozinho. Nas argumentacoes finais, os advogados de Andrews disseram que ele estava tentando assumir toda a culpa para que ela nao ganhasse dinheiro algum no processo.

'Acabou comigo'

Andrews disse que a divulgacao do video a deixou com medo, ansiosa e depressiva.

Ela disse ao juri que passou a ser tao cuidadosa que procura cameras escondidas em aparelhos de ar-condicionado de hoteis e muda de quarto com medo de ser filmada.

""Me senti envergonhada, humilhada, mortificada por causa do video"", disse durante seu depoimento, em que chorou diversas vezes.

Andrews disse que um dos momentos mais dificeis foi quando especulou-se que ela mesma havia divulgado o video para ganhar publicidade.

""Todo mundo dizia que eu estava fazendo aquilo para ganhar fama e atencao e aquilo acabou comigo"", disse, chorando.

Em um video transmitido durante o julgamento, Barett disse que escolheu Andrews porque ela era popular.",[]

bbc.com,,Apple v FBI: US debates a world without privacy,"['North America Technology Reporter', 'Dave Lee']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption First up at the hearing was FBI director James Comey

Is there such a thing as security so good it's a danger to society?

That's the bigger picture at hand as Apple continues to fight an order to unlock a terrorist's iPhone.

That fight made its way to Capitol Hill on Tuesday for a hearing in front of the House Judiciary Committee, the government body that covers matters relating to how law and order is enforced in the US.

Over the course of four meandering hours, representatives dived headfirst into the complexities of the case FBI director James Comey said is the most difficult issue he has ever had to deal with.

He told the committee that his organisation was seriously concerned by the growth of what law enforcement describe as ""warrant-proof spaces"" - the term given for methods of communication or storage that, even with the correct permission from the court, can't be accessed. Not by police and not by technology companies.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Apple has strong support among its users - and from the technology industry

""If we're going to move to a place where it's not possible to overcome that,"" Mr Comey warned, ""that's a world we've never lived in before in the United States.""

How did governments lose control of encryption?

Apple v the FBI - a plain English guide

Judge backs Apple in iPhone fight

Apple's boss hits back at FBI conduct

Bill Gates calls for terror data debate

His demand that Apple assists his agency in weakening the iPhone's security was met with this from California Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren.

""The alternative [to strong encryption] is a world where nothing is private.

""Once you have holes in encryption, the rule is not a question of if, but when those holes will be exploited and everything you thought was protected will be revealed.""

Physical intrusion

Apple was represented in this hearing by its lead counsel, Bruce Sewell.

Aside from customer letters, and a somewhat stage-managed interview with ABC, it's the first time the computing giant has been put under scrutiny over its refusal to comply with the FBI order.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Apple's lead counsel Bruce Sewell said breaking into the iPhone would be dangerous

Mr Sewell put in a strong performance thanks, largely, to the testimony of cryptology expert Prof Susan Landau - whose pivotal input I'll discuss later.

Mr Sewell endured fierce exchanges with South Carolina Congressman Trey Gowdy, who was angry at what he deemed a lack of cooperation in this controversial case.

How is it possible, the Congressman offered, to live in a world where the FBI has the authority to stick a finger up someone's rear in search of drugs, but not the power to look at the locked iPhone of that same suspect?

There's no simple answer to that, of course, though Apple might contest that law enforcement's capability to carry out such physically intrusive actions doesn't increase the general public's risk of exposure to an unruly finger or two.

'No no no'

But, crass comparison aside, Congressman Gowdy's heated questioning eventually arrived at this key point - if Apple won't comply with this order, he thinks the company must at least be forthcoming in sharing what it is actually prepared to do.

In a similar vein, the session's soundbite moment came from the mouth of Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner, who scolded Apple for having the audacity to demand Congress do something without offering any solution itself.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Congressman Trey Gowdy was at times irate at Apple's position

""All you've been doing is saying 'no no no no',"" the Congressman said.

""You're operating in a vacuum.

""You've told us what you don't like. You haven't told us one thing about what you do like. When are we going to hear about what you do like so Apple has a positive solution to what you are complaining about.""

Congress could, he added, continue unassisted by Apple, ""but I can guarantee you aren't going to like the result"".

Mother's diary

That's because, judging by some of the questioning during the session, some members of Congress consider it unfathomable that police cannot reach the information kept in Apple devices.

It's a barrier hindering many, many cases. Mr Comey could not say exactly how many phones the FBI wanted to unlock nationwide, other than that it was ""a lot"".

Later in the hearing, we learned that there are 205 locked iPhones currently held by police in New York alone.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Prof Susan Landau offered her expert insight into the risks of breaking encryption

We were reminded about a case involving Brittany Mills, an expectant mother who was shot and killed on her doorstep in Louisiana last year. Her baby boy died soon after.

Ms Mills - whose family attended the hearing - kept a personal diary on her phone that could contain crucial information about the murderer. The phone is locked, rendered unreachable by Apple's encryption software.

""I think about the nine-year-old girl who asked 'why can't they open the phone so we can see who killed my mother',"" said Louisiana Congressman Cedric Richmond.

Mr Sewell said Apple had done a lot to help with that investigation, but without creating the kind of tool demanded by the FBI in the San Bernardino case, it would be unable to assist further.

Making a smarter FBI

But maybe someone else could?

Republican Congressman Darrell Issa - a favourite among tech enthusiasts thanks to his opposition to several bills considered to be anti-internet - gave Mr Comey a hard time over the process leading up to asking for Apple's help.

Mr Issa said the FBI had not explored all the options for accessing the data and circumventing Apple's security.

He said the FBI should be investing in bringing in people with that expertise, not relying on companies like Apple to do the work for them.

Point being - if the FBI could crack the phone itself, Apple's opposition would be irrelevant.

This call was backed up by the thoughts of Prof Landau, an independent cryptology expert who argued, with some force, that there was no way the FBI's request in San Bernardino could be carried out safely.

Image copyright Telegram Image caption The so-called Islamic State has used encrypted app Telegram to announce attacks

She said that while Apple could no doubt keep the code required to crack Syed Farook's phone a secret, the real issue is what will happen when Apple is subjected to possibly hundreds of requests to do the same thing on other devices.

She said the surge of orders would mean Apple would need to create a faster process to handle the task, one that would by its nature be vulnerable to exploitation through interception, or perhaps a rogue employee.

Prof Landau insisted the only real course of action was for the FBI to invest heavily in becoming smarter - rather than compelling Apple to make its products less secure.

Because a weakened iPhone would have one critical side effect, she said. Criminals would simply use other, more secure methods to talk to each other - apps created by countries outside the US, offering encryption mechanisms even more secure than those offered by Apple currently.

Should that happen, the wishes of Congress matter not a jot.

""What you're saying,"" Congressman Jerrold Nadler asked Prof Landau, ""is that we're debating something that's... undoable?

""That's right.""

bbc.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,The islands where dragons are real,['Jane Palmer'],"On an archipelago of the Lesser Sunda Islands, which sweep arc-like through the Java Sea, maps can legitimately be marked with the archaic warning used by medieval cartographers: here be dragons.

These dragons might not breathe fire or fly, but they are no less awe-inspiring or dangerous than their mythical counterparts. Up to 3m long and weighing as much as 70kg, these beasts can run 18mph (29km/h) to catch their prey. Once they have a water buffalo, or deer, between their jaws, they inject anti-coagulant containing venom into deep wounds, speeding up blood loss. The victim simply bleeds its way to an excruciating death  perhaps a fate worse even than being seared by the flames of a mythical beast.

It is a combined arsenal system, says Bryan Fry of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. You have the teeth as the primary weapon and, if you dont die outright from cutting a femoral artery, you are going to keep bleeding until you are out of blood and then you are dead.

These modern day monsters are the Komodo dragons (Varanus komodoensis) of Indonesia. They live only on the islands of Rinca, Gili Motang, Nusa Kode, Flores, and Komodo. The worlds largest lizards, they are believed to be the last survivors of the giant lizards that meandered through Australia millions of years ago. Scientists believed these dragons then spread westward, reaching the Indonesian islands about 900,000 years ago.

As such, they have survived ice ages, sea level rise and the many earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis that plague the Lesser Sunda Islands. But despite their enduring nature, in the late 1970s, experts began to fear for the dragons survival.

The dragons are up to 3m long and weigh 70kg

Earlier in the century, trappers captured the Komodo dragons and sold them to zoos and private collectors. Even as this practice stopped, big game hunters sought them as trophies or they were killed for their skin or feet. Consequently, the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List categorises the dragons as Vulnerable and international trade is prohibited by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

In 1980, wanting to preserve its iconic dragon, Indonesia established the 700 sq mile (1,810 sq km) Komodo National Park. The park, which includes the three major islands of Komodo, Rinca and Padar, and numerous smaller islands, was declared a World Heritage Site in 1986.

Successful conservation measures in the park have meant that the population of the dragons appears to be stable at about 3,000, with most living on Komodo and Rinca. Having survived decades of human onslaughts it seems, for now, the dragons are safe from extinction. But the numbers of egg-laying females remain dangerously low, and other ominous threats loom on the horizon. Whether these dragons will survive in the long term, and not join the ranks of their ancestors  the legendary, 7m-long giant goannas  is not guaranteed.

It was not until the early 1900s that scientists first encountered the dragons, although rumours of their existence abounded well before then.

Their size is always mind-boggling, says Tim Jessop, an integrative ecologist from Deakin University in Geelong, Australia. Theyre not only long, they are incredibly robust and solid and stocky.

Encounters with the Komodo dragon inspired the movie King Kong

In 1912, a Dutch army man, Lieutenant van Steyn van Hensbroek, visited Komodo Island, shot a dragon dead and sent the skin to naturalist, Peter Ouwens, who wrote the first-ever scientific paper on the massive lizards. Fourteen years later, American W. Douglas Burden set off to the Lesser Sunda Islands of Indonesia to capture a dozen giant lizards for the American Museum of Natural History. His memoir of the expedition Dragon Lizards of Komodo, gave the dragons their nickname and its tales of adventures and confrontations with the hoary beast inspired the movie King Kong.

Just to have this kind of oddity out there in the middle of nowhere is pretty incredible, Jessop says.

But the dragons look at home in the craggy, jagged islands that jut out of the sea, Jessop says. Unlike the lush rain forested areas of Sumatra or Java, the Lesser Sunda Islands are relatively dry and brown, except for the few short months of monsoon. The vegetation is a mix of scrubby woodland and savannah grasslands that support the dragons main prey, deer.

Against this backdrop, the dragons prove well camouflaged while they wait patiently for their next meal. Once a deer, pig or even a human  the dragons arent fussy about what they eat  ambles by, the dragons spring into action delivering their one-two punch combination of razor sharp teeth and venom.

I have seen what this animal can do and how badly these animals can injure humans, says Achmad Ariefiandy, with the Indonesian Komodo Survival Program (KSP). Ariefiandys research on the dragons has him working with the lizards in remote locations far from hospital access and hes understandably cautious. There is no point acting like a movie star if you end up getting bitten, he says.

As the dragons can eat 80% of their weight and then go without food for several weeks, most of the time they lounge lizard-like in the sun. They have been known to attack islanders  there have been four fatalities in the last four decades  but the locals respect the dragons and many regard them as sacred. Its a sentiment that Ariefiandy shares.

The dragons deliver a one-two punch combination of razor sharp teeth and venom

I fell in love with this species and the beautiful scenery at Komodo dragon habitat in East Nusa Tenggara, the first time I stepped my feet on Komodo Island, he says. Ariefiandys work involves spending most of his time in the field, walking between 10 and 20km a day across hilly terrain in the blistering heat. But Im happy to do that to achieve my dream, to lead the conservation of Komodo dragon, he says.

Scientifically informed conservation efforts first began in the mid 1990s when Claudio Ciofi, now a biologist at the University of Florence, arrived in Indonesia to complete a PhD in dragon genetics. Captivated by the creatures, and noticing that there were no major conservation projects to support them, Ciofi proceeded to devise a project from scratch. Believing that species conservation can only be truly sustainable and effective if it is owned by local people  not just scientists or foreign conservation professionals  Ciofis ultimate goal was to hand over the project to Indonesians.

At the stage we are today I think we are one of the few grassroots projects that has had any successful know-how transfer to locals, Ciofi says. That is the way all projects should be in developing countries.

Currently, government organisations under the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry, along with scientists at the KSP manage the conservation of the dragons.

The KSP researchers collect scientific information on the ecology of the dragons, with the objective of helping these organisations better focus their efforts. In a conservation role, the park and KDS also raise community awareness by paying educational visits to the villages and schools.

The Komodo dragon is a national flagship species, so it has to be Indonesians who protect the species

I was ashamed to see that so many foreigners lead the conservation of Indonesian species, Ariefiandy says. The Komodo dragon is a national flagship species, so it has to be Indonesians who do the research and protect the species.

As many of the threats to the species come from the interface with islanders, understanding the local culture and how best to manage the competing demands on the land has proved key. Before the formation of the park, deer hunting was a major problem  deer being a major source of dragon food. In the 1980s, excessive deer hunting on Padar wiped out the resident dragons. Successful management within the park boundaries has since minimised hunting.

Conservation efforts have led to relatively stable dragon numbers on the two main islands of Komodo, which are home to about 1,100 dragons each. But outside the park boundaries, on the island of Flores, the story is less rosy. The scientists believe that Komodo dragons once roamed most of Flores, but now reduced numbers live only on the north and west coasts where 80 sq km of land is protected within four nature reserves.

The real culprit here has been habitat loss from the conversion of forests to agriculture, Jessop says. Villagers have also started fires to increase the pasture stock for their livestock.

Many dragons live outside the reserves and they frequently rub shoulders with the ever-burgeoning human settlements. As well as losing their habitat, they have to compete for their deer and pigs with local villagers.

For the last decade, conservationists have attempted to address such challenges in the Wae Wull nature reserve on Flores with a multi-pronged approach that integrates wildlife monitoring and the involvement of the local people in protecting the dragons habitats. The programme managers have restored a sentry post, established patrolling activities and prey population surveys, and theyve also trained rangers in wildlife-monitoring techniques. Building community awareness has proved key. I think the recipe is to integrate the science and community based programmes, Ciofi says. You can't do one without the other.

If everybody works together on conservation efforts the species could survive for thousands of years

A recent assessment of the dragon population within the Wae Wull reserve indicates that it has remained stable over the last few years and the researchers are looking to apply the same type of approach to northern Flores where the other three reserves are located. This successful programme indicates what is needed to address future challenges to the dragons survival: engaging with the local government and local people to use the land in a sustainable way.

If everybody works together on conservation efforts, and if local people become aware that they gain a benefit from the dragon, then this species could survive for hundreds, or thousands, of years, Ariefiandy says.

But human activities arent the only threat to the dragons. Given they live on only a few islands in the world, and their genetic diversity is limited, the dragons are particularly sensitive to changes in the climate.

Rising sea levels could encroach upon the low coastal valleys that make up most of the dragons habitat and changes in precipitation could mean that the woodlands are no longer amenable to nest laying or baby dragons. As young dragons climb trees for protection they could be more vulnerable to attack, even from adult Komodo dragons.

The care of the dragon now lies in the hands of the local people

Ciofi believes that as the dragons live from the coastline up to 500m and nest laying takes place in a variety of vegetation, climate change is still not the greatest threat to the dragons  it would merely decrease their habitat and maybe reduce their numbers. The most negative possible outcome for the their survival is that a rapidly increasing human population could, in 20 years or so, wipe out their habitat. But with the current success of conservation efforts, this scenario could be avoided.

Within ten years, if we are able, with the help of the local government, to secure the current populations that will be enough for the long term survival of the species, Ciofi says.

Currently Indonesian researchers are travelling by boat to the islands north of Flores and setting up cameras traps to assess the habitat for the dragons in that region. Its a total Indonesian story, Ciofi says. The care of the dragon now lies in the hands of the local people.

On one such trip last year, the researchers received a nice surprise: dragons had nested for the first time on Ontole Island, just off the north coast of Flores.

This is important because it proves that the population is reproducing on northern Flores and, if well protected, it can stabilise, Ciofi says. It is very hopeful.

Last March, Indonesian conservationists from the department of forestry, researchers from the KSP and locals worked like proud parents to make sure the eggs hatched safely and the hatchlings made their way safely to the trees. Sixteen baby Komodo dragons now live on the island, munching on geckos and similar morsels, and basking in the sun as the lizards they were born to be.",[]

bbc.com,,'Two and a Half Front War' is well under way,"['Diplomatic Correspondent', 'Jonathan Marcus']","Image copyright Reuters Image caption Iraqi forces are preparing to fight IS in Mosul

The war in Syria has not gone away, but the efforts to bring about a cessation of hostilities have succeeded in bringing about a partial lull in the fighting.

Russian bombing continues, and the US-led air campaign against so-called Islamic State (IS) also marches on.

While much of the world's attention has been on Syria there have been significant developments in Iraq; some key pointers to important new capabilities being deployed; and more indications that preparations are under way to extend the anti-IS campaign to Libya.

For all the drama, hyperbole and tension of the nominating process in the US presidential race, what is happening now in Syria, Iraq and Libya is of crucial significance. Events there are shaping the world with which the next occupant of the White House will have to contend.

In Iraq, the IS-held city of Mosul is the next great prize.

Eight to 12 Iraqi brigades are being prepared for the offensive. Nobody imagines this will be either fast or easy.

But as the Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford noted only a few days ago, ""operations against Mosul have already started....we're isolating Mosul.""

He was referring to a variety of local offensives - both in Syria and Iraq - to sever vital communications links between the IS strongholds of Raqqa and Mosul.

What is life like in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, Syria?

Animated diary: Life in Raqqa under 'Islamic State'

Inside Mosul: What's life like under Islamic State?

A key part of this is the US and allied air campaign. But in the past ten days Syrian opposition forces have reclaimed Shaddadi, in the north-east, described by the Americans as ""a critical node for IS training and logistics, as well as for its oil enterprise.""

In a separate operation Iraqi forces have launched an offensive against IS supply lines around the city of Samarra, some 95km (60 miles) north of Baghdad.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Ash Carter and General Joseph Dunford have briefed on their plans in Iraq

Much of the debate now surrounds the extent of likely US help with the Mosul offensive.

The Iraqi government is highly sensitive on this subject and US official statements are guarded. But it is clear that a significant US effort will be needed.

One idea is for US advisers to be deployed much closer to the action. But the most significant US role - apart from air power - may be to ensure that the Iraqi forces that are engaged have adequate logistics and supplies to enable them to sustain themselves at a high tempo of activity.

Of course there are other things the US could do. And briefings over the past few days have offered pointers to significant new capabilities that are being brought into play.

Cyber attacks

US Defence Secretary Ash Carter hinted strongly at the stepped-up role of cyber attacks against IS, especially in Syria.

This, he said, was being used ""to interrupt, disrupt IS's command and control, to cause them to lose confidence in their networks, to overload their network so that they can't function.""

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Iraqi forces launched an offensive around the city of Samarra

General Dunford stressed the parallels between the physical and the cyber battlefield.

""We're trying to both physically and virtually isolate IS, limit their ability to conduct command and control, limit their ability to communicate with each other, and limit their ability to conduct operations locally and tactically.""

Up to now Washington has largely taken the fight to IS from the air. But there are indications that special operations on the ground are also being stepped up.

Just a few days ago it was announced that US Special Forces had seized a key IS operative in Iraq.

This seems to be the first significant operation by a 200-strong team of Delta Force commandos who arrived in the country in recent weeks.

The US Defence Secretary set out an expansive role for this small force.

""It's a tool that we introduced as part of the accelerated operations to conduct raids of various kinds, seizing places and people, freeing hostages and prisoners of ISIL, and making it such that ISIL has to fear that anywhere, anytime, it may be struck.""

Libya concerns

There have also been sporadic US air strikes against IS targets in Libya - most recently one launched in mid-February by US warplanes from a base in the UK, that struck an IS training camp outside Sabratha, some 50 miles west of Tripoli. But in Libya too there have been hints of much more going on beneath the surface.

Libya, given its lawlessness and its proximity to Europe, is fast becoming a major security concern for the US, the EU and Nato.

Control and crucifixions: Life in Libya under IS

IS-linked groups are becoming well-established and entrenched. Several countries have indicated their willingness to help with security problems in the country - not least Italy, which might lead any operation.

Image copyright AP Image caption US bombing of a suspected IS training camp in Libya killed at least 38 people

Up to now the essential condition for any western-backed mission (in which the US too would probably play a key supporting role) is to have agreement, by the various Libyan factions, on a national unity government.

Such a deal has proved elusive, but some military operations are already under way. In late-February the French newspaper Le Monde revealed what it said was a ""secret war"" in Libya being waged by French special forces.

The reports prompted considerable anger from the French government and a variety of linked stories suggesting that US and British operatives might also be on the ground.

Back in January the Italian authorities agreed to allow the Americans to operate armed drones from the Sigonella air base in Sicily with officials at the time indicating that these missions would be to protect US forces on the ground that might be under threat.

Whatever may be happening on the ground in Libya - and governments rarely acknowledge operations by special forces - other steps are being taken to bolster regional security.

Britain, for example, has despatched a small military training team to Tunisia to help its forces secure its border with Libya.

The Tunisian government is also engaged in talks with the German authorities about the possible training of Libyan security forces in Tunisia.

Stability elusive

So what might be termed ""the two and a half front war"" is well under way. Given time the US seems confident of a positive military outcome.

But you'll notice I don't use the word ""victory"". That would imply countries like Syria, Libya and Iraq returning to stability with inclusive governance and much-reduced corruption; in other words the removal of some of the very forces that helped to fuel the Islamist surge.

Looking more broadly at the region it is hard to see many positive developments that would indicate a return to stability.

If anything, the relatively settled borders of the post-colonial era are now being called into question like never before.

It doesn't seem that long ago that President Obama seemed to have relegated the Middle East as a US interest, giving priority to a pivot towards Asia.

But the Middle East isn't going away.

In many ways its problems are on the move. And it is going to dominate US foreign policy during the early years of Mr Obama's successor - and probably beyond.",[]
bbc.com,,'Stunning' operation regenerates eye's lens,"['Bbc News Website', 'Health Editor', 'James Gallagher']","Image copyright SPL Image caption The therapy was tested on children, but early trials on elderly people are ""very encouraging"" too.

A pioneering procedure to regenerate the eye has successfully treated children with cataracts in China.

More than half of all cases of blindness are caused by cataracts - the clouding of the eye's lens.

An implanted lens is normally needed to restore sight, but the operation described in Nature activated stem cells in the eye to grow a new one.

Experts describe the breakthrough as one of the finest achievements in regenerative medicine.

The lens sits just behind the pupil and focuses light on to the retina.

About 20 million people are blind because of cataracts, which become more common with age - although some children are born with them.

Conventional treatment uses ultrasound to soften and break up the lens, which is then flushed out.

An artificial intraocular lens must then be implanted back into the eye, but this can result in complications, particularly in children.

Image copyright SPL Image caption Close up of a cataract clouding the normally transparent lens

The technique developed by scientists at the Sun Yat-sen University and the University of California, San Diego removes the cloudy cataract from inside the lens via a tiny incision.

Crucially it leaves the outer surface - called the lens capsule - intact.

This structure is lined with lens epithelial stem cells, which normally repair damage.

The scientists hoped that preserving them would regenerate the lens.

The team reported that tests on rabbits and monkeys were successful, so the approach was trialled in 12 children.

Within eight months the regenerated lens was back to the same size as normal.

The study is one of the finest achievements in the field of regenerative medicine until now Dr Dusko Ilic, King's College London

Dr Kang Zhang, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: ""This is the first time an entire lens has been regenerated. The children were operated on in China and they continue to be doing very well with normal vision.""

It also showed a dramatically lower complication rate ""by almost every measure, supporting the superiority of the treatment"".

However, he says larger trials are needed before it should become the standard treatment for patients.

Image copyright Getty Images

The procedure was tried in children because their lens epithelial stem cells are more youthful and more able to regenerate than in older patients.

Yet the overwhelming majority of cataracts are in the elderly.

Dr Zhang says tests have already started on older pairs of eyes and says the early research ""looks very encouraging"".

Commenting on the findings, Prof Robin Ali from the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, said the work was ""stunning"".

He told the BBC News website: ""This new approach offers greatly improved prospects for the treatment of paediatric cataracts as it results in regeneration of a normal lens that grows naturally.""

He said getting similar results in adults ""is likely to be more difficult to achieve"" but could ""have a major impact"".

""It might be superior to the artificial lenses that are currently implanted, as the natural lenses should be able to accommodate looking at different distances more effectively,"" he added.

Dr Dusko Ilic, a reader in stem cell science at King's College London, said: ""The study is one of the finest achievements in the field of regenerative medicine until now.

""It is science at its best.""

Far-reaching

Dr Zhang believes that targeting stem cells already sitting in the eye could have ""great potential"" for treating a wide range of diseases from macular degeneration to glaucoma.

A separate study by Osaka University in Japan and Cardiff University, used stem cells to mirror the development of the eye.

They were able to produce a range of specialised eye tissues including those that make the cornea, conjunctiva, lens and retina.

The findings, also published in Nature, showed the lab-grown tissues could restore sight to rabbits with corneal blindness.

One of the researchers, Prof Andrew Quantock, said: ""Our work not only holds potential for developing cells for treatment of other areas of the eye, but could set the stage for future human clinical trials of anterior eye transplantation to restore visual function.""

Nao e que o mundo esteja girando ao contrario, mas a sombra da Lua comecou a se projetar primeiramente nesta quarta-feira sobre regioes do Pacifico, sobretudo no oeste da Indonesia, e logo cruzou a linha internacional de data, o marco imaginario que coincide com o meridiano 180, onde ainda era terca-feira.

De qualquer maneira, foi um eclipse solar total, fenomeno astronomico que nao ocorre com frequencia.

O mais recente ocorreu em marco de 2015 - antes disso, houve um registro em novembro de 2012.

Image copyright Getty Image caption O eclipse solar visto desde Myanmar, no sul da Asia.

Os cidadaos de algumas partes da Indonesia foram os sortudos que desta vez puderam apreciar plenamente esse fenomeno que ocorre quando a Lua se interpoe entre a Terra e o Sol.

Isso faz com que o Sol projete uma faixa de sombra de 100 a 150 km de largura sobre a superficie terrestre.

Nessa ocasiao tambem e possivel apreciar, da Terra, a chamada coroa solar, jatos que parecem se projetar atras da Lua.

Em regioes da Australia, do sul da China e do sudeste da Asia, bem como no Havai e no Alasca, tambem foi possivel ver um eclipse parcial do Sol, como se faltasse um pedaco dessa estrela.

Segundo a Nasa (agencia espacial americana), o eclipse deveria durar tres horas, mas o periodo depende da localizacao do observador.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Cidadaos de partes da Indonesia foram os sortudos que puderam apreciar o eclipse plenamente desta vez.

Lugares onde o eclipse foi visto ficaram totalmente as escuras entre 90 segundos e 4 minutos.

Quem nao estava nas regioes do eclipse tinha a possibilidade de acessar a pagina da Nasa na internet, que transmitiu o fenomeno ao vivo, visto desde a Micronesia.

Oportunidade cientifica

Pesquisadores da Nasa aproveitaram o eclipse para estudar a fisica do Sol.

Desde a Indonesia, usaram um instrumento chamado camera de polarizacao para captar 59 exposicoes do Sol em tres minutos, com o objetivo de recolher dados sobre a parte inferior da atmosfera solar, que e mais quente do que a superficie do astro.

Essa area pode ser vista durante os eclipses totais do Sol, quando a superficie brilhante desse astro esta totalmente bloqueada pela Lua.

Image copyright AFP

Ce mouvement d'humeur risque d'aggraver l'approvisionnement en carburant du premier producteur d'or noir sur le continent africain.

""Les operations au sein de la Compagnie petroliere nationale nigeriane (NNPC) ont ete suspendues a l'echelle nationale"", a declare Babatunde Oke, un cadre de l'Association nigeriane du petrole et gaz naturel (Pengassan).

L'appel a la greve a ete lance par la Pengassan et l'Union nationale des travailleurs du gaz et petrole (Nupeng) pour protester contre ""la decision unilaterale du ministre du petrole, Ibe Kachukwu, de scinder la NNPC"".

M. Kachukwu, egalement a la tete du NNPC, a annonce la semaine derniere un plan de fractionnement de la NNPC en 30 compagnies independantes afin de regagner le chemin de la rentabilite.

Selon Babatunde Oke, les syndicats sont preoccupes des consequences pour les employes de cette restructuration et ont appele ""les membres de la NNPC a se mettre en arret de travail jusqu'a ce que le ministre s'engage sur cette question"".

Cette action devrait avoir des consequences dans le transport du carburant depuis les depots de la NNPC et reduire des stocks deja bas. Depuis deux semaines, de longues files d'attente se sont formees dans les stations service.

Avant la chute des cours du petrole sur les marches mondiaux qui ont plombe son chiffre d'affaires, la NNPC a longtemps ete accusee d'inefficacite et de mauvaise gestion des milliards de dollars de revenus petroliers, incitant le gouvernement a sa refonte pour une meilleure transparence et stopper la corruption.

Bien que premier producteur africain de petrole, le Nigeria depend d'importations de produits petroliers par manque de capacite domestique de raffinage. Le gouvernement travaille a ameliorer les capacites des raffineries publiques et subventionne les prix a la pompe.

Uma polemica proposta de um grupo politico sueco defende que homens que nao queiram ser pais tenham direito ao que chamam de ""aborto legal"" de responsabilidade - ou seja, decidir se querem se envolver com o filho depois do nascimento da crianca.

O braco jovem do Partido Liberal sugere que ate a 18a semana de gravidez um homem possa tomar essa decisao.

O prazo de 18 semanas coincide com o limite em que uma mulher e autorizada a fazer um aborto na Suecia.

De acordo com a proposta, os homens que nao quiserem ter filhos poderao assinar um documento no qual abdicam da responsabilidade pela crianca, afirmando que nao querem se envolver em nenhum aspecto da criacao do filho.

""Isso significa que um homem renunciaria aos deveres e direitos de paternidade"", disse ao site de noticias sueco The Local Marcus Nilsen, presidente da Juventude Liberal.

Nesse cenario, eles nao teriam que pagar pelo sustento e educacao da crianca mas, por outro lado, nao poderiam sequer conhecer o filho ou filha depois do nascimento.

Igualdade

Maddy Savage, editora do The Local, disse a BBC que o grupo jovem do Partido Liberal promove a proposta como parte dos esforcos do pais para a igualdade de generos, argumentando que os homens teriam os mesmos direitos que as mulheres nesse ambito.

Mas Savage lembrou que a proposta veio de um grupo conhecido por suas controversias e sequer conta com apoio da ala principal do partido.

""(A ideia) surgiu de repente de um partido que conhecido por suas posicoes radicais. Eles disseram recentemente que o incesto deveria ser permitido entre alguns irmaos e que, em alguns casos, nao ha problemas em ter relacoes com um cadaver"", relatou.

De acordo com o jornal The Washington Post, a proposta desencadeou um debate entre os suecos. No Twitter alguns afirmaram que a ideia era ""loucura"" e ""nojenta"".

Ate o proprio Partido Liberal rejeitou a proposta de sua ala jovem, o que provavelmente a impedira de avancar.

""Acreditamos que a lei atual e boa do jeito que esta"", afirmou Eric Aronsson, assessor de imprensa do partido, ao site Nyheter24.

O proprio Marcus Nilsen, defensor da proposta, admitiu que ela nao tem recebido muito apoio. ""Achamos que (a ideia) valia o debate, mas as reacoes tem sido enormemente conservadoras, com muitas pessoas vendo-a como um ataque a familia nuclear"", disse ele ao The Local.

""Por outro lado, muitas pessoas ja se manifestaram nas redes sociais falando que os homens deveriam ter esse tipo de direito"", acrescentou Maddy Savage.

Em 1974, o pais se tornou o primeiro do mundo a oferecer a licenca-paternidade e estender aos pais a chance de tambem passar tempo em casa com os filhos.

Desde o dia 1o de janeiro, a cota compulsoria de licenca paternidade foi aumentada para 90 dias. Os casais recebem por lei 480 dias de licenca a partir do nascimento da crianca.

Nos primeiros 390 dias, quem opta por ficar em casa recebe 80% do salario, pago pelo Estado. Os 90 dias restantes sao tirados com pagamento menor.

Segundo a editora do site The Local, tambem e preciso lembrar que 50% dos casamentos do pais acabam em divorcio.

""E o padrao (no pais) e que os filhos (de familias separadas) vivam metade do tempo com a mae e a outra metade, com o pai. Entao algumas pessoas entraram no debate afirmando que e bom para os pais ter alguma escolha"", disse a jornalista.",[]

bbc.com,2016-03-03 00:00:00,A deserts once-in-a-decade super bloom,['Sivani Babu'],"The desert was aglow with flowers. As I descended Californias Panamint Mountains, the familiar landscape turned my windshield into a movie screen. Vast swaths of yellow carpeted the once barren ground, the desert gold booms resting high on their stalks with vivid petals that radiated in the morning light. Other flowers with names like purple mat and gravel ghost peppered the landscape with fuschias and ethereal whites. I got out of my car, breathing in the sweet, lilting florals. This once-in-a-decade super bloom of wildflowers was why I and so many others had come to Death Valley National Park.

I was asleep, and I woke up, and there were flowers everywhere! The bubbling voice that spilled into the morning belonged to a young girl of about six who wore fine pollen, the colour of a canary feather, like face paint. Her parents and she had driven all night from the lush redwoods of northern California to see the desert blooms. The largest national park in the contiguous United States, Death Valley stretches from California into Nevada and draws an international crowd of roughly 1m visitors each year, but seldom do people visit with so much urgency. Such is the power of a phenomenon that is both rare and transient.

The recipe for a Death Valley super bloom appears simple: heavy rains, followed by warm temperatures and lighter rain showers. If it is too hot or too cold, if the wind is too dry or if there is too much or too rain little, the wildflowers might still bloom, but not with the synchronization and density of a super bloom. The great complication, of course, is that Death Valley is the driest place in North America and the hottest on Earth. Rain is rare. Unmerciful heat is not.

Much like the previous two super blooms in 2005 and 1998, this years bloom is the product of strong El Nino activity. Heavy rains fell last October, stimulating millions of seeds that had been lying dormant in the soil for years. Autumn and winter then brought the right amount of warmth and rain to trigger the mass sprouting of seedlings.

If conditions hold, the super bloom could carry through the month, but there are no guarantees in the desert. A change in the weather could return the land to barren rock and soil, rapidly turning the blossoms to seeds that might not sprout again for years. This is life in Death Valley: hard-fought and short-lived.",[]

bbc.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Can we really reinvent the wheel?,['David K Gibson'],"We write a lot about autonomous vehicles, and have explored the special sensors, interfaces, communication systems, and computing power that will be integral to their inevitable deployment. We hadnt, until now, thought much about the tyres. But then, we don't work for Goodyear.

We arent trying to predict the future, but were looking to the future of mobility and connectivity, says Goodyears Keith Price, spokesperson for the companys R&D arm. At last weeks Geneva motor show, the tyre and rubber company unveiled two new concepts specifically designed for autonomous vehicles. The first, called the Eagle-360, literally reinvents the wheel (a cliche we imagine is banned company-wide) with a stunning spherical design.

The advantages of ball-shaped tyres are legion. Using them, an autonomous vehicle could move in any direction at any angle at any time, spinning the vehicle in place to turn around, making completely parallel lane changes, or crab-rolling sideways to parallel park in a tiny space after dropping its passengers. These manoeuvres are impossible to execute using a human/steering-wheel interface (which requires forward momentum to execute a turn), but with a robot in charge of a spherical tyre, just about anything is possible.

The disadvantages of ball-shaped tyres are rather more obvious. A sphere has no central axis, and therefore no axle wherewith to affix something like a vehicle or a drivetrain. The Eagle-360 (in concept) will overcome this design constraint by using magnetic levitation to suspend a vehicle above its tyres, and use the same technology to drive and brake them. Of course, maglev technology is today deployed only in the very linear application of trains. Goodyear isnt currently working with a technical partner to develop a rounder version of maglev  at least pre-Geneva. Says Price, I wouldnt be surprised if there have been conversations after the unveiling.

The 360s tread pattern is a brainy solution to another problem. While linear treads make a ton of sense when a tyre rolls around a single axis, a sphere needs to grip no matter which way its going. To achieve this, Goodyear looked to nature, mimicking the whorls of brain coral in the 3D-printed tread design. This leaves the tyre looking something like the rubber balls from gym class, and gripping like the pads of a human fingertip. Like your fingertips, the 360 would become softer and grippier in wet conditions, but stiffen when dry. Looking at how to adapt tread compounds is something that goes on today, notes Price. Were always asking, How can you maximize what you get with grip, mileage, and wet traction?

The second tyre  in a boring, old toroid design  is the Goodyear IntelliGrip. Though it lacks futuristic optimism, it makes up for that with imminent practicality. It is, in fact, a rather logical extension of integrated tyre-pressure monitors.

As you remove humans from the equation, cars will have a lot more to do themselves, notes Price. That means a lot higher sensor content from the vehicle for reading the environment and the road. Logically, the best place to read the road is where the rubber meets it, and the IntelliGrip is a quick study. It (again, in concept) will have integrated sensors for road surface and weather conditions, monitor its own wear, cue the vehicle to reduce speed or power to the wheels, and even adapt itself to shorten stopping distances or grip better in turns. Goodyear is collaborating with some unnamed auto companies to integrate these kinds of sensors into future control systems.

Price is quick to point out that these tyres are only concepts. These are mere possibilities, and what we do with our concept tyres is much like what car companies do with concept cars, he says. Its a way to let the R&D folks look at what might be coming and begin the conversations around it.

Goodyear doesnt think well ever see these two tyre models exactly as they appeared in Geneva, but elements will certainly find themselves in future products. I hear auto manufacturers say that by 2035, theyll be selling 85 million autonomous cars a year, says Price. Someone is going to have to make those tyres.

Amazon has started screening video clips in some of its warehouses showing how employees accused of stealing were caught and fired, according to a report by Bloomberg.

The news agency says the alleged offenders are represented by silhouettes and the words ""arrested"" and ""terminated"" are superimposed.

An Amazon spokesman had no comment.

Many companies tackle workplace theft, but experts were surprised by the severity of the measure.

The report referred to Amazon's US-based warehouses, and the BBC understands the tactic has not been deployed in the UK.

The details coincide with the announcement that the online store is creating 1,000 jobs at a new centre in Manchester.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Bloomberg reported that some workers had hidden merchandise in their socks

'New heights'

Bloomberg said it based its article on interviews with 11 of Amazon's current and former warehouse workers and security staff. It reported that one ex-employee called the scare tactic ""offensive"".

""These videos show former colleagues being caught stealing things [or] changing the addresses on packages as they leave the fulfilment centre, and even some of them with the word arrested stamped on the silhouette,"" reported Bloomberg's Cory Johnson.

""It's a problem that Amazon is of course very concerned about, but their tactics to try to get people not to steal are reaching new heights.""

The news agency said that the clips are shown via flatscreen TVs. These are also used to display information about firings tied to workplace violence, it said, as well as more positive announcements.

It added that in warehouses not fitted with screens, information about sackings is sometimes taped to the walls.

""Lost stock is a massive issue affecting all retailers regardless of whether they are online or store-based,"" commented Bryan Roberts from the shopping consultancy TCC Global.

""There are lots of measures in place, such as searches to make sure that stuff doesn't go missing. But this perhaps does sound slightly extreme.""

Another expert was more critical, saying Amazon's practices appeared to be ""profoundly emotionally unintelligent"".

""What sort of an organisation has got to the point that it thinks this is a satisfactory or commendable way to be behaving?"" asked Matthew Gwyther, editor of Management Today.

""It reminds me of Ben Hur with them standing over the rowers with a whip.

""I find it extraordinary that its relationships with its workforce have reached such a low point that it would do something like that.""

bbc.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Do video games make children violent? Nobody knows  and this is why,['Rich Stanton'],"In 1976, the driving simulation Death Race was removed from an Illinois amusement park. There had, according to a news story at the time, been complaints that it encouraged players to run over pedestrians to score points. Through a series of subsequent newspaper reports, the US National Safety Council labelled the game gross and motoring groups demanded its removal from distribution. The first moral panic over video game violence had begun.

This January, a group of four scholars published a paper analysing the links between playing violent video games at a young age and aggressive behaviour in later life. The titles mentioned in the report are around 15-years-old  one of several troubling ambiguities to be found in the research. Nevertheless, the quality and quantity of the data make this an uncommonly valuable study. Given that game violence remains a favoured bogeyman for politicians, press and pressure groups, it should be shocking that such a robust study of the phenomenon is rare. But it is, and its important to ask why.

A history of violence

With the arrival of Pong in 1973, video games became a commercial reality, but now, in 2016, they are still on the rocky path to mass acceptance that all new media must traverse. The truth is that the big targets of moral concern  Doom, Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty  are undeniably about killing and they are undeniably popular among male teenagers. An industry report estimates that 80% of the audience for the Call of Duty series is male, and 21% is aged 10-14. Going by the 18 rating on the last three entries, that means at least a fifth of the games vast audience shouldnt be playing.

The problem is, while regulatory boards like Pegi in Europe and ESRB in the US are doing what they can to inform people about age certification, you have products like Mega Bloks, one of Mattels major toy lines, featuring Call of Duty branded playsets. The question of video games and violence remains controversial because of relationships like this. Consumers, parents, the games industry itself, regulatory bodies, and the headline-hungry media  all contribute towards an era in which moral, sociocultural and developmental concerns are pitted against commercial interest.

Over the past three decades, there have been plenty of headlines about games research, but on many occasions the studies are flawed, limited or misleading, or are simply misrepresented  often, it has to be said, by their own accompanying press releases.

Violent videogames cause an increase in aggression long after the game has been turned off is the headline for one 2010 study, which draws this conclusion by linking a 20-minute gaming session with an abstract aggression test 24 hours later, and differentiating between players who had thought about the game in the interim and those who hadnt. This is a tenuous experimental setup in the first place and one that fails to account for any number of other factors, so to draw firm causal conclusions  never mind extrapolate (as the authors did at the time) that it is reasonable to assume that our lab results will generalise to the real world  is fanciful.

The problem is not just on academias side: the media almost never stops to challenge a tasty headline linking games and real-world violence. This use of games as panic fodder is not benign, but percolates into real-world flash points that have consequences. Rockstar North, the pioneering Scottish development studio behind the Grand Theft Auto series, also made Manhunt  a 2003 stealth-horror title that features brutal killing animations. Manhunt was erroneously implicated in a 2004 murder case by the tabloids, with MP and chair of home affairs committee Keith Vaz telling the House of Commons: The parents of the victim believe that the perpetrator of this savage attack was influenced by the videogame Manhunt.

The police reported that a copy of the game was found in a bedroom  but it was later discovered that the game was actually owned by the victim, Stefan Pakeerah, and the crimes motive was instead drug-related robbery. At trial the defence, prosecution, and eventually the judge all agreed that the game was not a factor. But by this point Manhunt had already been banned by several large retailers and the link was fixed in the public mind to the point where facts didnt matter  the Daily Mail reported the eventual sentencing as Teenager gets life for Manhunt murder. Before the evidence had emerged the paper had campaigned for the game to be banned.

When a sequel to the game was announced three years later, the response was predictable. Dogged by controversy, Manhunt 2 was subsequently refused classification by the BBFC  not once, but twice. It eventually limped out, heavily-censored, on appeal and years late. Manhunt 2 is a graphically violent game, but its unexceptional when put next to the Saw films  and is intended for adults. It is difficult to believe that the BBFCs decision was based on the content of the game, rather than a response to media pressure. This is an extreme example but it shows how inaccurate actions can arise from inaccurate reporting, anecdote, and unwarranted inference.

The state of the art

Its in this context that Januarys research paper is exceptional. Entitled Prospective Investigation of Video Game Use in Children and Subsequent Conduct Disorder and Depression Using Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children it was co-authored by Dr Peter Etchells of Bath Spa University, Dr Suzanne Gage and Professor Marcus Munafo of the University of Bristol, and Dr Adam Rutherford.

I think it started off as frustration really at all the stuff you see in the news, says Etchells. Either studies that are overhyped or people making claims that arent backed-up by evidence. Suzanne Gage was using this Children of the 90s dataset and we thought why dont we have a look in this dataset to see if theres anything we could use to look at this question. We didnt have any funding, its something we had to do in our spare time.

The Children of the 90s is a group of around 14,500 children born in the Avon area between 1991-1992 and observed for the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children [Alspac]. This size makes it a prime research tool, but the combination of clinical data and video game data gives it an unusual value: conduct disorder is a real-world measure of aggression, not an abstract clinical test; the video games played are differentiated by genre. This doesnt mean the dataset lacks problems, such as how useful genre classifications really are, but its a solid foundation.

The Conduct Disorder study looks at whether children at the age of eight or nine are playing video games, what genres theyre playing, and then, using statistical controls, looks at a specific measure of aggression at age 15 to see if there is any association between the two. Conduct disorder is a bunch of related negative behaviours in children and adolescents, which here is measured in six levels  from (1) extremely unlikely you have it to (6) very likely.



This is a context-finding study rather than a causal study, so were not saying you play violent videogames, you get more aggressive, says Etchells. With that, what our main finding shows is that if you take these different games people have played when theyre eight- or nine-years-old, and try and account for as many potential confounding variables as possible that might have an effect on aggression, socioeconomic status and stuff like that, at age 15 there is a 19% higher chance of being in one of those higher conduct disorder bands, as you go from not playing games to playing puzzle games to playing shoot-em-up games.

Then if we take the violent/non-violent division, which I dont really like calling that, if you play shoot-em-up games theres a 19% risk of you being higher up in one of those conduct bands than if you didnt play violent games. So that doesnt mean youre going to be diagnosed with conduct disorder, its just that youre maybe more likely to show those aggressive tendencies.

Lies and damned lies

Here we come to the difficult job of interpreting statistics, because a bald 19% may seem to indicate quite a sizeable increase  but that number represents a correlation rather than a causal factor, spread over six levels, for a disorder that you have a tiny risk of being diagnosed with in the first place (of 1,815 children in the sample, 26 met the criteria.) On top of this there are the external factors (confounders) which the study accounts for, and the ones it doesnt  the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns.

Its not if you play videogames that will cause you to have higher risk of being in a higher conduct disorder band, says Etchells. Thats just one part. If you look at the p-values [which gauge the uncertainty around the data] theyre quite high at over 0.5  so the strength of that association seems to be quite weak. It suggests there are other things that are having an effect that are driving that association.

What the Conduct Disorder study is saying is that theres a relationship here worth looking into, but it cant point the finger at anything, and that above all the association is weak. This conclusion has to be interpreted in the context of (a) the solid data and (b) other studies arguing for a much larger and in some cases causal effect between violent videogames and aggressive behaviour. The fact these findings are so uncertain also highlights the difficulties researchers face in getting a handle on the subject.

The problem with violent video games and aggression is that defining and categorising both is an inexact science. The Children of the 90s study began in 1991, so the shoot-em-ups this paper was looking at when those kids were eight or nine might be the likes of Goldeneye 007, Medal of Honor, Quake III and so on. These games are from a different and often incomparable era to the modern first-person shooter, a Call of Duty or Halo, which is much more realistic visually and in most cases includes a competitive online element.

The sharp-eyed will have spotted that shoot-em-up is itself something of a misnomer, more commonly used to refer to 2D space blasters than 3D first-person shooting games. Such a distinction might seem rather fine, and many conflate the two, but it really matters. In the questionnaires they asked essentially what kind of games do you play, and categorised them by genre, says Etchells. Now the options arent great, and its a point that came up in review: shoot-em-up is a different category to FPS. So there are assumptions in what weve done, in the sense that if youre playing Goldeneye youre probably going to tick the shoot-em-up box, even if that might not be the exact genre.

This seems a not-unreasonable assumption, though it shows how even such good data can have a troubling fuzziness up-close. But this is a broader issue for games research. We dont have a good way of categorising games, says Etchells. I dont think genres is a particularly good way of doing it. Technically Portal 2 would be in our shoot-em-up category here, but thats not an especially violent or competitive game. You could make an argument that certain platform games are violent, even say Mario in the sense of squashing goombas.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Portal 2. Photograph: Valve

To briefly unpack that, Portal 2 could be fairly described as a puzzle game  but one played from a first-person perspective. Your character has a gun, but it fires portals onto walls rather than bullets, and is used to navigate the environments. Minor elements of the game, such as the automated turrets in some levels, mean you could argue for Portal 2 to be categorised as a first-person shooter, but the content bears so little relation to a game like Call of Duty it shows how essentially meaningless the definition is.

When you look at videogames research, its difficult to escape the suspicion that many of these studies dont understand the different aspects and modes in a game like Call of Duty  and much more importantly, how players interact with them. Call of Duty has a single-player mode, several co-operative modes, and an online competitive mode, each of which you play with a different mindset.

We didnt look at context massively in our study, but how you play videogames will likely have an effect on what their effect on you is, says Etchells. So it also might be different playing a particular mode solo to playing it with loads of people in the room with you, and if those people are mates or your parents or siblings.

The Conduct Disorder study draws a distinction between competitive games and violent games, but most contemporary games defy such easy categorisation while many of the biggest hits have elements of both. What of last years breakout hit Rocket League, which is ultra-competitive but has no violence? Some games are designed to be lifestyle commitments over months and years, like the online shooter Destiny or any given massively multiplayer role-playing game, while others last minutes. Genres are an inadequate way of categorising the nature of these experiences, and thus measuring their potential impact.

There have been 25 years of research in this area and, for the most part, its not very good research, says Etchells. Particularly the experimental side. Its a real missed opportunity, because theres so much stuff about this in the media and we really dont have a handle on it, and it would be good to have a handle on it so we could maybe get a final say at some point  either no, games are not an issue or, look, games are an issue but in these populations in these situations and its these games specifically. We cant say anything even close to that at the minute.

The funding gap

Its worth remembering that part of the problem is the reluctance of funding bodies to support researchers in this area  its surprising to say the least that a study of this importance had to be undertaken by the researchers in their spare time. What video games research needs is more high-quality work in the field, because the questions are not impossible to answer. The dataset we used is open and available, says Etchells. What Id like to see happen in this area is people doing more open science, making their data available to other researchers. Just so we can start getting it right! Because theres so much stuff thats not right out there.

The violence debate also holds us back from other, possibly more interesting, questions about this omnipresent interactive entertainment medium. There is an enormously positive side to games that receives no attention, yet the potential fruits of research could be enormous. Take brain training games and whether they work, says Etchells. The evidence there is quite shaky, some suggests they do work and a lot says they dont, but if there were anything there that would be novel and quite important. Thats a more useful question to ask really.

Without quality research, we allow debates about videogames to be influenced by ideologically-driven sceptics. It is less than a decade since one of Britains greatest developers, Rockstar North, had to censor Manhunt 2. Perhaps well look back on that the same way we look at something like A Clockwork Orange, in 1972, being blamed for various violent acts  the whipped-up reaction to which saw Stanley Kubrick request the film be withdrawn from British distribution.

Film is not the same as videogames, of course. But Kubricks response to the charge that A Clockwork Orange was inspiring copycat violence is, in the absence of answers, an important one to consider. To try and fasten any responsibility on art as the cause of life seems to me to put the case the wrong way around, he said. Art consists of reshaping life, but it does not create life, nor cause life. Furthermore, to attribute powerful suggestive qualities to a film is at odds with the scientifically accepted view that, even after deep hypnosis in a posthypnotic state, people cannot be made to do things which are at odds with their natures.

Do videogames make your kids violent? No one knows and, by now, we really should have a better answer than that.",[]
bbc.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Hands off with the driverless Mercedes,[],"TopGear.com's Jason Barlow recently had the opportunity to jet off to Portugal to claim some seat time in the new Mercedes-Benz E-Class. As ever, the German carmaker's bread-and-butter saloon aims to be many things to many drivers  from beige-painted workhorses for Stuttgart taxi drivers to leather-lined Q-ships for American mover/shaker types. But beyond its hedonistic delights, cutting-edge safety features and clever powertrain options, the new E packs one altogether stunning bit of tech-wizardry: an driverless-operation system called Drive Pilot.

Writes Barlow: ""[The system] uses a stereo camera, radar sensors and a modestly-sized box of tricks secreted in the rear wing to drive the car autonomously  accelerating, braking, changing lanes and even coming to a complete halt without any input from the driver."" This feature was sophisticated enough to earn the new E-Class an autonomous testing licence in the US state of Nevada  the first for a standard-production car. And it's a technology that will figure prominently in Mercedes' model strategy during the next few years. We have been pursuing the vision of accident-free driving for some time,"" said Daimlers Chairman, Dr Dieter Zetsche, ""and we are now making big, big steps towards the realisation of that. When it comes to autonomous cars, we have to be the first, we cannot be a fast follower.

Barlow's first impression of Mercedes' 10th-generation E? ""[It's an] awesomely, almost intimidatingly complete car"".

On the ride and handling:

""Like the C-Class, the new E-Class seems to have rediscovered the concept of genuine comfort, which is vastly more important in a car like this than being able to corner it on its door-handles.""

On the interior:

""The E-Classs cabin represents a truly amazing confluence of technology and style, and will have rivals down the road in Bavaria and Ingolstadt scratching their heads, and plunge the Coventry-based lot into existential despair.""

On diesel engines:

""Anyone anticipating wholesale rejection of diesel in the wake of the VW scandal wont get any joy from Mercedes: Zetsche says take-up rates on diesels are exactly the same as before, and an engine as good as [the E220d's 2-litre turbo four] is only going to keep it in play.""

On the new E350e plug-in hybrid:

""The E-e can do around 20 miles in pure EV mode, a haptic response on the throttle pedal advising you that maximum electric oomph is being deployed, while a double pulse prompts you to make better use of the regenerative braking mode. Set a sat-nav destination and the car will optimise its energy blend according to the route. Forget autonomous driving: this is artificial intelligence. Spooky.""

On the Drive Pilot system:

""As impressive as the tech is in theory, it remains imperfect in practice: I found myself second-guessing it repeatedly on the test route around Lisbon, unable and unprepared to trust it. If you take your hands off the wheel, a warning chime will sound, and if you keep them off the wheel longer than 60 seconds the car will assume youre a moron or have passed out, and glide carefully to a complete stop. Its fiendishly clever, but really  whats the point of an automated car that still needs your hands on the wheel?""

On the new E's place in the market:

""Making the best cars is our core business,"" Zetsche tells TG.com. ""But the car doesnt end with the hardware. Now its about widening the scope."" Writes Barlow: ""The new E-Class does so with impressively realised, widescreen ambition.""

bbc.com,2016-02-10 00:00:00,The man who could stop planes,['Amanda Jones'],"For three trying days I had been traversing Africa, trying to get from Niger to Kenya. The bulk of my time had been spent dealing with sour officials, hopelessly battling malarial mosquitoes and sitting wretchedly in filthy, stinking-hot airports. I had come from three tough but rewarding weeks in the Sahara, and the great beauty and monstrous insouciance of the desert had left me with a feeling of serene detachment.

By the time I arrived in Johannesburg to catch my fourth and final flight to Nairobi  19 hours behind schedule  that hard-earned peaceful detachment had gone. All tolerance had fled. I had 25 minutes to catch my flight, and I was faced with an obscenely lengthy queue snaking towards a line of passport control booths.

South Africa, a crucible of long-quashed anger and a now-flailing backlash, was in turmoil. World press had seized on the stories of crime, violence and internationally linked corruption. In response, South Africas authorities had decided to force all visitors, even those transiting, to undergo document inspections. This impossible delay rang a resounding death knell to my Kenya safari plans.

I stared out of an airport window in misery. Dusk was approaching. Rain exploded on the ground. Hunched, glistening figures lurched through the downpour as if under attack. The thought of being caught in this city alone, with no money to afford a decent hotel, struck me with paralyzing dread.

When I turned back to the room, there was a young man lingering beside me. I stared at him stonily, in no mood for small talk.

Hello, he said cheerfully. Can I help you? You look in need of some assistance.

I judged him to be in his mid-20s, possibly 10 years my junior. He was short, slight and brown skinned, with a South African accent. He was dressed in jeans and a beer emblem T-shirt, with a well-used backpack slung over one shoulder  the global uniform of the travelling student.

I doubt you can help, I replied dismissively. I was supposed to be in Nairobi tonight. I had to be in Nairobi tonight. However, my plane is about to leave without me.

Oh, dear, he said, and his eyes showed genuine sympathy for my situation. Right, well then, lets see if theres anything we can do about that. Come with me. He moved off briskly, but I remained where I was, confused, embarrassed and reluctant to lose my place in line. He stopped and gestured for me to follow. This time I did, although hesitantly. He cut to the head of the queue, approached an official and spoke to her in Afrikaans. She regarded me coldly but said nothing as I walked past without showing any documentation.

Wait here, he instructed, indicating a row of seats. Which airline were you on? Right then, let me see if I can hold that flight for you. Wont be a mo.

I sat, trying to imagine who this young man could be that he could circumvent immigration officials and stop planes.

He returned shaking his head. Sorry, its gone. It was the last one out tonight and all the flights tomorrow are solidly booked.

I obviously looked stricken as he then said, Dont worry, well get you on a plane. Im Ron*, by the way. He stuck out his hand.

Curious as to whom the ""we"" was that could get me on a flight, I looked him in the eyes and asked, Ron, I was wondering... how did you know I needed help back there? Do you work here? What is it you do?

FBI, he replied, as casually as if hed said ""janitorial staff"".

My job is to look for anxious people. And you looked rather anxious.

Im on loan to the South African government from the US. Illegal immigration, drug smuggling, terrorism, that sort of thing. Were here to train their authorities. My job is to mingle with crowds and look for anxious people  suspects in fact. And you looked rather anxious.

You thought I was smuggling drugs? I said, horrified.

No, no, he answered earnestly, smiling. I just thought you looked like a fellow American in need of assistance. But youre not American after all, are you. You mustve lived there quite a while now, although you werent born there. New Zealand, right? You fooled me, I had you pegged for American.

I was shocked. He had not seen my passport, nor was I wearing running shoes, a baseball cap, a collegiate sweatshirt or any other dead giveaways of Americanism. He was correct  and he had gleaned all this from the few words I had spoken. I suddenly felt exposed and defensive.

But youre not American, either, I accused him. His English was thick with Afrikaans. Even his vernacular was Southern African.

I am. Im from El Paso, Texas. Been here four months now. Languages are sort of my thing. Afrikaans most recently.

Observing him more closely, it occurred to me that he was the perfect undercover agent, if thats what he could be called. With his mocha skin, brown eyes and brown hair, he could have been North African, Arab, Mexican, Indian or South American. Being blond, pale and tall, my entire being shrieks foreigner in most parts of the globe. How extraordinary it must be, I thought, to be able to fit in anywhere.

Look, he said kindly. You look tired. Do you have somewhere you can go? I know a hotel. Its not too expensive, and its clean, safe, relatively close. I could drop you off there, its on my way home. Well pick up your luggage; theyll send it through now that you missed the flight.

I was at the point where I had to decide whether to trust him or not. Women travelling alone are persistently faced with this dilemma. Rather than be paralyzed by suspicion, we have to learn to rely on the murmurings of instinct, to calculate the risk  and then in the end to hope like hell those instincts are correct.

Do you happen to have any ID on you, Ron? I asked. I dont doubt you, but, you know, its just smart...

Women travelling alone are persistently faced with this dilemma

He pulled out a plastic card with FBI printed in block letters, his name and a photo. I peered at the picture, in which he looked completely different. He was, indeed, a true human chameleon. The situation suddenly seemed surreal and I resisted the urge to laugh. We all know people like Ron exist, but somehow they do so in a reality not our own, or in movies.

I can take you to the hotel, he said, but theres one thing I have to do before we leave. You can come along if you like.

I had nothing better to do, and by now I was extremely curious. I followed.

We stopped at an airport restaurant where Ron purchased meals in large quantities, explaining the situation as he took the money out of his wallet.

We arrested some Pakistanis this morning. They were trying to get up to Nairobi on false passports. Were deporting them tomorrow. Just thought Id drop by and deliver this to them. The police cant afford food for deportees here.

I was surprised by how much he was telling me, and even more so as I followed him behind the security doors and through the inner workings of the airport. People nodded at Ron, but no-one bothered to ask who I was or why I was there. Probably they assumed I was a suspect.

We entered a barren concrete building adjoining the airport. A long, narrow corridor was lit with fluorescent light and littered with drink cans and cigarette butts. There were no windows, only opposing rows of closed doors. I began to feel uneasy. In a matter of hours I had been shepherded from the innocence of the front room traveller to the gritty, behind-the-scenes realm of crime and law enforcement.

A policeman stood guard outside the Pakistanis room. He unlocked the door as Ron approached and we entered. Through a serpentine haze of cigarette smoke, I saw three men crouched on a narrow bed and another two on the floor. They were in their 30s, dressed in dark Western clothing. Their eyes were as black as onyx and hard with bitterness and defeat. Ron set the food on a table, speaking in a language I did not recognize, probably Urdu. The men muttered. One said something and Ron dug into his pocket and tossed him a pack of cigarettes. The man inclined his head in grudging thanks. We left the building in silence.

You must be hungry, too, Ron said cheerfully as we re-entered the airport to get my bags. Come on, well stop on the way to your hotel.

He spoke 23 languages; he could tell the time by the sun.

Over dinner, we spoke mostly about Rons job. I could tell he was trying to impress me, but he did it in such an open way it was rather endearing. He spoke 23 languages; he could tell the time by the sun; he was an expert in martial arts; and he had never been seriously attached to a girl. He had been posted to cities all over the world, but he was tired of airport work. What he really wanted to do, he told me, was be an air marshal on international flights. Professionals, he explained, were hired to sit in the centre of the plane with a loaded gun in case of hijacking or other disturbances. It rarely happens, and you get paid quite well.

Despite my insistence, he refused to let me pay for dinner, telling me to save my money in case I should be stranded again. Later, he dropped me off at a modest hotel somewhere on the outskirts of the city. He had been every bit the gentleman.

As I left the car he said, As far as your leaving tomorrow, I checked on flights and theres one leaving at eight in the morning. Its full, but I can arrange to get you on. Ill pick you up at six.

No, no, no, I protested. Youve done enough. I wont get you out of bed at such an ungodly hour. You really are too kind, Ron.

I insist, he said. Id rather know you got there safely, and youll need me to get you on the flight. Im deporting you. Sleep well.

He was there at six, just as he said he would be, armed with the same smile.

At the airport Ron disappeared, returning with a boarding pass.

Got you on. The airline thinks you are a deportee, but you shouldnt care so long as you get there. There wont be any record of it, dont worry.

I wasnt sure how to thank him adequately for all he had done. He had undoubtedly broken rules for me, or most certainly bent them. I wondered if hed bumped some other traveller from the flight and felt momentary guilt.

As he walked me to the gate, I asked him something Id wondered the night before.

Why did you feed those men, Ron? You paid with your own money, didnt you? I mean, they looked terribly shady.

Ron sighed and his chin dropped. I felt as if Id said something dreadful, something terribly disappointing. He stopped walking. This job, he said, has taught me that our presumptions about people are rarely true. We have so many preconceptions, especially about foreigners, but they are nothing more than fear of the unknown. We quite comfortably make sweeping generalisations about entire nations of people. These people we suspect of being evil, most are just students and deadbeat dreamers and artists and teachers and greedy businessmen  the same characters that populate all societies. And then some of them, a tiny portion of them, are actually individuals with intent to harm others. But we foolishly judge them all by the few who are bad.

Our presumptions about people are rarely true.

Ron was becoming heated, staring vacantly ahead. I bought those men food because in all likelihood they are simply seeking an improved life. And even if those five individuals arent innocents like most of the folk I encounter, even if they are real criminals, then a show of kindness may help, just a little, to debunk their preconceptions about us. Until we can prove them as bad people, it is simply kinder to trust their intentions.

Besides, he added, everyone has to eat.

Ron-the-FBI-agent was right, and not only did he help me, a complete stranger, that day, but he taught me a lesson I shall take to my grave: our world just might be a better place if we put a little more kindness and trust into our days.

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,Quais os proximos passos da oposicao na batalha do impeachment?,"['Mariana Schreiber', 'Da Bbc Brasil Em Bras Lia']","Image copyright ABr Image caption Aliado de Eduardo Cunha, o deputado Paulinho da Forca faz pressao por decisao do STF

Animada com os acontecimentos da semana passada, a oposicao trabalha para tentar destravar o tramite de impeachment na Camara dos Deputados.

O principal elemento que reacendeu o animo da oposicao foi a revelacao do conteudo de uma suposta delacao premiada do senador Delcidio Amaral (PT-MS), com graves acusacoes a presidente Dilma Rousseff e seu antecessor, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, de tentarem intervir na Operacao Lava Jato.

Alem disso, na sexta-feira, a Policia Federal fez uma acao contra Lula, que foi levado coercitivamente a depor sobre suspeitas de beneficiamento no esquema de corrupcao da Petrobras.

Nesta terca-feira, as 16h, esta prevista uma reuniao dos lideres da oposicao com o presidente do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF), Ricardo Lewandowski. A intencao e pedir que sejam analisados o mais breve possivel os embargos movidos pelo presidente da Camara, Eduardo Cunha, na tentativa de modificar a decisao do Supremo sobre o rito do impeachment.

No momento, a tramitacao do pedido de impedimento contra Dilma esta paralisado a espera de que o STF se pronuncie sobre esses embargos. E a corte que dara a palavra final sobre como devera ser composta a Comissao Especial da Camara que emitira um parecer a favor ou contra a abertura do processo contra a presidente.

Nesta segunda-feira, foi finalmente publicado o acordao com o resumo da decisao tomada no fim do ano passado, o que abre espaco para que os embargos sejam analisados semana que vem.

Como estrategia de pressao para que o STF decida logo a questao, a oposicao combinou de obstruir a pauta de votacao da Camara, disse o deputado Paulo Pereira, o Paulinho da Forca, lider do Solidariedade.

""Decidimos sexta que vamos obstruir a pauta para exigir o que o Supremo decida logo os embargos do rito do impeachment. Como as coisas se agravaram mais do que a gente esperava, e isso afeta profundamente a vida de milhoes de brasileiros, nos precisamos que o Supremo decida rapidamente"".

Julgamento

Image copyright Ag. Camara Image caption Apos romper com o governo, Cunha tornou-se uma das vozes mais ativas da oposicao

No julgamento realizado em dezembro, a maioria dos ministros seguiu o voto do ministro Luis Roberto Barroso e decidiu por anular a votacao secreta que elegeu a chapa de oposicao para ocupar a maioria das cadeiras da comissao.

Sob o argumento de que deveria ser mantido o rito do impeachment do ex-presidente Fernando Collor (1990-1992), eles entenderam que nao poderia haver chapa avulsa pois o correto seria que os lideres de cada partido na Camara indicassem seus representantes (os numero de membros de cada legenda e proporcional ao tamanho de sua bancada). Decidiram tambem que uma eventual eleicao teria que ser aberta.

Na tentativa de modificar essa decisao, o DEM peticionou para que fosse incluido no processo a ata da sessao em que foram escolhidos os membros da comissao de impeachment de Collor. O partido argumenta que a eleicao so nao foi secreta porque os membros indicados foram confirmados por aclamacao, ja que havia consenso entre os parlamentares.

Para justificar a possibilidade de candidatura avulsa (sem ser por indicacao dos lideres), o DEM tambem cita um trecho em que o entao deputado Adylson Motta (PDS-RS) questiona o entao presidente da Camara, Ibsen Pinheiro, sobre a possibilidade de se candidatar de forma avulsa a uma vaga de titular da comissao, ja que nao queria ser indicado como suplente. Pinheiro responde que era permitido candidatura avulsa, mas que o prazo para inscricao ja tinha terminado.

O lider do DEM, Pauderney Avelino (AM), disse a BBC Brasil que ele e mais tres parlamentares da oposicao  o lider do PPS, Rubens Bueno (PR), Raul Jungmann (PPS-PE) e Jose Carlos Aleluia (DEM-BA)  se reuniram com o ministro Barroso em fevereiro. Avelino, Bueno e Aleluia eram parlamentares em 1992.

""Contamos ao ministro que nos tres tinhamos participado do julgamento do Collor e ele ficou mais interessado nos nossos argumentos"", contou Avelino.

Delcidio

Apesar de a existencia da delacao de Delcidio nao ter sido oficialmente confirmada, os parlamentares da oposicao dao como certa sua existencia e confiam que seu conteudo sera homologado ainda esta semana pelo ministro do Supremo Tribunal Federa (STF), Teori Zavascki.

Segundo parlamentares da oposicao ouvidos pela BBC Brasil, a estrategia e que, assim que isso acontecer, os tres juristas que apresentaram o pedido de impeachment aceito por Cunha  Helio Pereira Bicudo, Miguel Reale Junior e Janaina Conceicao Paschoal  venham a Brasilia para um ato politico, em que solicitarao oficialmente que seja acrescentada a denuncia original o depoimento de Delcidio.

A principal acusacao do pedido original de impeachment se baseia nas supostas irregularidades fiscais cometidas pela administracao Dilma em 2014, o que teria permitido ao governo inflar os gastos em ano eleitoral. A intencao agora e usar as supostas revelacoes do senador para dar folego as acusacoes de corrupcao no governo.

""Depois da revelacao da delacao do Delcidio nao tem como o Supremo rejeitar a homologacao"", acredita Paulinho da Forca.

Delcidio, que era lider do governo no Senado quando foi preso em novembro, teria dito no suposto depoimento que a presidente e seu antecessor sabiam do esquema de corrupcao da Petrobras. Alem disso, afirmou que Dilma tentou usar a nomeacao de ministros para o STJ (Superior Tribunal de Justica) como meio de conseguir a soltura de executivos que estao preventivamente presos pela Lava Jato.

Essa acusacao foi negada pelos magistrados citados. O governo diz que Delcidio mente por vinganca porque o Planalto nao tentou intervir para solta-lo.

Manifestacoes

Para os adversarios do governo, a revelacao da suposta delacao de Delcidio e a acao da PF contra Lula devem contribuir para aumentar a adesao as manifestacoes antigoverno convocadas para o proximo domingo. A ideia e que os parlamentares da oposicao participem em peso.

""As manifestacoes ja estavam marcadas ha muito tempo. Os fatos (da ultima semana) contribuiram para que venha a dar uma mobilizacao grande"", acredita Rubens Bueno.

Essa visao, no entanto, nao e consenso entre analistas politicos.

Segundo Pablo Ortellado, professor do curso de Gestao de Politicas Publicas da USP, a presenca de partidos politicos nos protestos pode afastar as pessoas das ruas. Ele vem acompanhando os protestos com pesquisas juntos aos manifestantes e sua conclusao e que prevalece um sentimento de rejeicao a toda a classe politica, nao so ao PT, embora o partido seja o mais criticado pelo grupo.

""Quando analisamos a evolucao das mobilizacoes pelo impeachment em 2015, observamos um efeito aparentemente paradoxal: quanto mais o processo de impeachment se torna viavel, do ponto de vista da tramitacao parlamentar, menor e a mobilizacao"", nota ele.

""As mobilizacoes podem ter diminuido no decorrer de 2015 porque, a medida que a tramitacao avancava, ficava claro que grupos politicos acusados de corrupcao se beneficiavam do processo - em particular o deputado Eduardo Cunha. Essa manipulacao politica da indignacao contra a corrupcao deve ter gerado desconfianca e provocado desmobilizacao"", pondera.",[]

'The China story', or the 'Look East' policy. All part of the same narrative.

Sometimes when I read reports that forecast doom and gloom for a particular industry based on falling Chinese demand, I feel like shaking my head.

China has been broadcasting for some years now that its economy is transitioning and rebalancing, moving away from fixed asset investment to an economy that depends on services and consumption.

bbc.com,,How tech is forcing firms to be better global citizens,"['Business Reporter', 'Catherine Lawson']","Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Our world in their hands: Firms have fewer places to hide their misdeeds in the internet age

Cute baby animals covered in oil washing up on beaches; pensioners thrown into poverty; ""dieselgate"". What do all three have in common?

Before scandal struck, the three corporations concerned - BP, Enron, and Volkswagen respectively - were all judged to be among the world's top companies for their corporate social responsibility (CSR) work.

As a result of corporate scandals like these, the credibility of CSR - firms giving something back voluntarily to local communities - has taken a beating.

Critics dismiss it as a way of glossing over corporate malfeasance - a mere PR tick-boxing exercise.

Image copyright US Coastguard/Reuters Image caption The Deepwater Horizon oil disaster forced BP to reassess its PR efforts

But now technology is forcing companies to up their game and interact with communities more directly and effectively.

Nowhere to hide

Platforms such as Kritical Mass have certainly given a fillip to the idea of crowd-supported philanthropy, attracting individuals and corporate sponsors to its projects, whether that's saving vultures in Kenya or bringing solar power to rural communities in west Africa.

Sponsors can offer funding, volunteers, expertise or marketing. So rather than imposing corporate ideas of ""do-gooding"" on communities in a patronising manner, firms can simply respond to demand.

HelpfulPeeps has pushed its volunteering platform into more than 40 countries worldwide, connecting people who want to share their time, knowledge and skills with each other for free.

In the UK, online platform Neighbourly connects community projects and charities with companies and people willing to volunteer their resources. For example, Starbucks has pledged 2,500 days of volunteering and has so far backed 70 community projects.

Neighbourly founder Nick Davies says there's value to be had from encouraging staff to volunteer. First, people who volunteer are happier at work; second, there's a commercial case for it: ""It's quite easy to prove that businesses that do the right thing also do well.""

Mr Davies believes that we have entered an era of internet transparency in which consumers are starting to flex their muscles and expect companies to do the right thing - not just be seen to do the right thing.

Judging by the strong public appetite for supporting good causes and campaigning against injustice on sites such as Change.org, Avaaz.org, JustGiving and GoFundMe, his assessment appears to be correct.

And LinkedIn says millions of members have signalled on their profiles that they want to serve on a non-profit board or use their skills to volunteer.

Tackling hunger

Aware of this groundswell of good will, Mr Davies founded Neighbourly 18 months ago as way of helping companies engage with consumers locally.

One of the platform's projects involves helping retailer Marks & Spencer redistribute surplus food to those who need it most.

By tackling the issue at a local level, Neighbourly has already connected 100 Marks & Spencer stores and plans to have the retailer's entire network active by the end of 2016, says Mr Davies.

Image copyright Neighbourly.com Image caption Neighbourly has linked up with Marks & Spencer to redistribute food

""We've already connected 40 tonnes of food or 56,000 meals already,"" he says. ""By the end of the year we could absolutely have redistributed a million meals through the use of technology just with Marks & Spencer.""

Technology is also being used to advance women's rights in the developing world with initiatives like Samasource.

This not-for-profit organisation gives computer-based data projects to women in areas where traditional gender roles may prevent them from pursuing careers.

Since 2008, Samasource has trained and employed more than 3,000 women through data projects with companies such as Getty Images, DropBox, Microsoft and TripAdvisor in countries including Haiti, Ghana, Uganda, Kenya and India.

Sharing expertise

Tech companies in particular are offering expertise and skills to good causes as way of making a tangible difference.

For example, in January, Microsoft announced that through its new organisation, Microsoft Philanthropies, it will donate $1bn-worth (700m) of cloud computing resources to serve non-profits and university researchers over the next three years.

Microsoft president and chief legal officer Brad Smith said: ""We're committed to helping non-profit groups and universities use cloud computing to address fundamental human challenges.""

And data analytics specialist Applied Predictive Technologies (APT) has offered its data-crunching skills to help the Capital Area Food Bank charity distribute food more efficiently to hungry people around the Washington DC area.

APT used data to develop a ""hunger heat map"" to help CAFB target resources and plan for future demand better.

In another project, APT helped The Cara Program - a Chicago-based charity providing training and job placements to people affected by homelessness or poverty - evaluate what made its students more employable.

APT boss Anthony Bruce says: ""In these 'data dives' APT employees use their analytic skills to distil actionable insights from the data that the charity collects. These insights are empowering charities to identify efficiently which of their strategies are most effective at fulfilling their respective missions.""

Sustainability the new CSR?

Stephanie Draper, deputy chief executive at Forum for the Future, believes sustainable business practices have already replaced CSR.

""Companies need to view [sustainability] as a core business issue - something that drives the business context,"" she says.

The UN's 2015 Sustainable Development Goals initiative has been successful in getting businesses to think about solving social problems, she believes.

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Has sustainability replaced corporate social responsibility as must-have corporate value?

For example, the Toilet Board Coalition is a global business-led coalition backed by Unilever that aims to tackle the world's sanitation issues through profitable, market-based initiatives that harness the latest technological innovations.

And Launch, an open platform jointly founded by Nasa, Nike, the US Agency for International Development, and the US Department of State aims to provide support for start-ups and ""inspire innovation"".

In the age of internet transparency, it seems corporates no longer have anywhere to hide - a spot of CSR whitewashing is not going to cut it anymore.

Technology is helping to bridge the gap between the haves and the have-nots.

bbc.com,,Alcohol: 2.5 million people bust weekly limit in a day,"['Michelle Roberts', 'Health Editor', 'Bbc News Online']","Around 2.5 million people in Great Britain - 9% of drinkers - consume more than the new weekly recommended limit for alcohol in a single day, latest figures from the Office for National Statistics show.

The 2014 data predates the new limit of 14 units of alcohol per week for men which began in January.

Although habits may start to change, experts say the figures are concerning.

The chief medical officer says there is no safe level of regular drinking.

The ONS figures show 58% of people - 28.9 million - drink some alcohol in a typical week.

This figure is lower than a decade ago but has remained stable over the last few years.

Young people are less likely to have consumed alcohol in the last week than those who are older.

Wine (including champagne) is the most popular choice of alcohol.

Single shot of spirits (25ml): 1 unit

Standard (175ml) glass of wine: 2.1 units

Large (250ml) glass of wine: 3 units

Pint of 4%-strength beer: 2.3 units

Pint of 5%-strength beer: 2.8 units

Pint of strong cider (8%): 4.5 units

Booze calculator

Of the 2.5 million who bust the weekly alcohol guideline in a single day, the majority were men. The most common age group was 25-44-year-olds, closely followed by 45-64-year-olds.

The most popular beverage for those who had drunk more than 14 units on their heaviest drinking day was normal strength beer, stout, lager or cider.

Of all those who said they drank alcohol in the last week, the percentage who exceeded the weekly limit in a day was highest in Wales and Scotland.

Jackie Ballard, chief executive of Alcohol Concern, said: ""Alcohol continues to be the leading risk factor for deaths among both men and women aged 15-49 and is linked to over 60 medical conditions including cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure.

""We need to raise awareness of the health harms.

""When it comes to alcohol, there are no safe limits of consumption.""

Sarah Toule, from the World Cancer Research Fund, said: ""When it comes to cancer prevention, people should avoid alcohol as much as possible as any amount increases the risk of cancer.

""If they are going to drink, it's important not to binge-drink and have no more than seven drinks a week spread over at least three days.""

A spokesman from the Portman Group, which represents the drinks industry, said: ""The vast majority of adults drink sensibly and safely; part of a decade-long improvement in our relationship with alcohol in this country. Underage-drinking, alcohol-related crime and drink driving are also in sustained decline.

""ONS figures are useful in highlighting the specific regions and communities that still need support and the best way to achieve this is through targeted local partnerships between local authorities, health services, businesses and voluntary groups.""

Public Health England said it was looking at the best ways to help tackle problem drinking.",[]
bbc.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,One animal has more babies than any other,['Ella Davies'],"Among mammals, rabbits are famously big breeders. They have been regarded as symbols of fertility since antiquity, admired for their ability to produce vast numbers of baby bunnies.

A couple of adaptations earn them this reputation: they are sexually active at just 3-4 months old and females can get pregnant as soon as they have given birth.

This means rabbits can produce multiple litters, of up to seven babies, through the breeding season.

But the season is really key. In Europe, rabbits only breed in spring and summer, limiting the number of offspring. However, in Australia and New Zealand, where European rabbits have been introduced, they can breed year-round in some areas raising as many as seven litters.

Unsurprisingly, rabbits are considered pests in these countries. In fact, pest status is often linked to breeding habits and can be a useful starting point for identifying the world's most fertile animals.

Every spring the Great Barrier Reef turns tides pink in a mass spawning event

For instance, Australia also suffers from overwhelming plagues of mice.

With an abundance of food and the right environmental conditions, mouse mothers have an average litter of six every month, which can themselves begin breeding the following month. Plague densities can peak at 2,700 mice per hectare in grain stores.

If those numbers are not extreme enough for you, consider ""the greatest sex show on Earth"".

Every spring the Great Barrier Reef turns tides pink in a mass spawning event. Instead of physically mating, corals synchronise the release of their sperm and eggs to boost the chances of fertilisation across the full extent of a reef.

""I do not think that anyone has really ever tried to count how many eggs an individual coral produces,"" says Dr Mary Hagedorn of the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute, who leads research at a pioneering coral fertility clinic in Hawaii. ""Most people describe it as massive numbers of eggs produced during a spawn and that could mean many millions of eggs produced by an individual coral.""

What at first glance appears to be superb virility is actually a risky strategy

Millions of eggs might sound like a lot, but time is against the corals. ""Corals have some of the most restricted reproductive patterns in the animal kingdom,"" says Hagedorn. ""For most corals, they only produce male and female gametes for 2 days per year.""

What's more, most of the young die. ""Even though corals produce massive numbers of offspring, the result is more-or-less the same as for other groups of animals: one or possibly two offspring are produced that grow to maturity,"" says Hagedorn.

So what at first glance appears to be superb virility is actually a risky strategy. Hagedorn warns that bleaching events, which stress the corals and their symbiotic algae, have a dramatic impact on future generations.

Elsewhere in the ocean, there swims a giant that was formerly recognised by Guinness World Records as the most fertile backboned animal: the ocean sunfish.

Their Latin name ""Mola mola"" means ""millstone"", and it is apt: these round, grey fish can measure 10 feet (3m) across and weigh up to 2 tonnes. Affectionately known as ""swimming heads"" for their large bodies and relatively small fins, they are often found basking in the sunlight near the surface of the ocean.

A newly-born summer female already contains the embryo of the next generation, like a tiny Russian doll

Sunfish are egg-carrying champions. Females can release an estimated 300 million into the water at a time. In Japanese waters, they are thought to spawn from August to October, suggesting they are multiple spawners.

""Large, mature ocean sunfish have a solitary life in the open ocean where finding mates is likely a challenge, so producing lots of eggs in multiple spawning events may increase chances of fertilisation and by multiple males,"" says Dr David Sims of the Marine Biological Association in Plymouth, UK.

As with the corals, only a few of their eggs will develop into mature adults  or the world's oceans would be a flapping mass of sunfish and not much else. ""We think they produce so many because the chance of fertilisation of eggs and subsequent survival of larvae is so low,"" says Sims.

If we want to find some truly stunning rates of reproduction, we need to look at smaller animals: specifically, insects.

Cabbage aphids are familiar to any gardener as prolific pests.

In the spring, females turn out 5-10 genetic copies of themselves a day. This continues through the summer when the daughters gain wings to help spread the family further.

A single aphid could spawn enough descendants to cover the Earth in a layer of aphids 149km deep within a year

Under the microscope, a newly-born summer female already contains the embryo of the next generation, like a tiny Russian doll. In autumn, the females finally produce some males, allowing for mating and some healthy shuffling of genes.

""Individually aphids are unremarkable in this regard, producing only 50 or so offspring. Many insects produce very many more,"" says Dr Richard Harrington, head of the long-running Rothamsted Insect Survey. ""However, combine that with their very short generation time  a week or even less under ideal conditions  and they may well be the insect reproductive champions.""

In perfect conditions, Harrington has estimated that a single aphid could spawn enough descendants to cover the Earth in a layer of aphids 149km deep within a year. In reality, mortality is high for the insects because they are preyed on by ladybirds, lacewings and a variety of birds.

But there are some insects that spend their entire lives reproducing. The queens of social ant colonies have workers to do everything else for them, and they may be the most successful reproducers of all.

At the head of a colony of African driver ants sits a monarch that can produce an estimated 3-4 million eggs a month. That may well be the record.

""However, it is important to note that although they produce the most per queen, many other species are not limited to a single queen and thus can achieve even greater levels of colony fecundity,"" says Thomas O'Shea-Wheller of the University of Bristol in the UK.

For instance, Argentine ants live in ""polygyne"" colonies with thousands of queens, which means their populations are truly spectacular. The largest of these mega-colonies stretches for 6,000km (3,700 miles) along the Mediterranean coast. Like the antipodean mice, they are considered pests.

In an odd twist, in their native Spain European rabbits are now considered ""near threatened"", due to disease, habitat loss and hunting pressure. Perhaps we should change the saying to ""breeding like ants"".",[]

La nina citada arriba es una de las victimas, y su declaracion fue tomada por funcionarios de la Comision de Derechos Humanos de la ONU, que difundio el caso y el de otros menores en un comunicado en enero.

El informe divulgado este viernes forma parte de una nueva politica de ""nombrar y avergonzar"" a los responsables, adoptada por la ONU tras el escandalo el ano pasado de abuso de menores a manos de cascos azules franceses en Republica Centroafricana.

De los nuevos 99 casos denunciados en 2015, 69 fueron de abusos cometidos por soldados en misiones de paz y 30 por funcionarios de la ONU en otras capacidades.

Image copyright GETTY Image caption Haiti es uno de los paises donde se denuncio explotacion o abuso sexual por parte de soldados o personal de la ONU.

Por primera vez se detalla la lista de paises involucrados. Hubo denuncias de abuso sexual contra soldados y policias de Alemania, Burundi, Ghana, Senegal, Eslovaquia, Madagascar, Ruanda, Republica Democratica del Congo, Burkina Faso, Camerun, Tanzania, Niger, Moldova, Togo, Sudafrica, Benin, Nigeria y Gabon.

Tambien hubo denuncias contra funcionarios de varios paises europeos y Canada.

La mayoria de los abusos tuvieron lugar en Africa, especialmente en Republica Centroafricana, pero tambien se denuncio explotacion sexual en Haiti.

El informe fue duramente criticado por Code Blue (""Codigo Azul""), una campana lanzada por la ONG con sede en Nueva York, Aids Free World (""Mundo libre de Sida""), para monitorear las denuncias de abuso sexual contra cascos azules y funcionarios de la ONU.

""Que ha hecho exactamente la ONU ante las mas de mil denuncias de abuso sexual contra su personal desde 2007? Bajo la mascara de que toma alguna medida, lo que realmente hay es inercia"", dijo la ONG en un comunicado.

""Uno me sujeto los brazos""

El informe de la ONU insta a los paises de donde provienen las tropas a juzgar a los culpables en sus tribunales. Tambien llama a la creacion de un banco de muestras de ADN de cascos azules, para facilitar los procesos criminales.

Image copyright GETTY Image caption La ONG Code Blue acuso a Naciones Unidas de inaccion y de vivir en un ""universo alternativo de burocracia"".

Pero mas alla de las recomendaciones, poco ha cambiado en el terreno.

Investigadores de la organizacion de defensa de los derechos humanos Human Rights Watch (HRW) que visitaron Republica Centroafricana denunciaron el mes pasado la violacion o abuso sexual de al menos ocho mujeres y ninas.

Los ataques tuvieron lugar segun HRW entre octubre y diciembre de 2015, mas de un ano despues del escandalo de abuso de menores por soldados franceses en ese mismo pais.

Image copyright GETTY Image caption Anders Kompass fue suspendido temporalmente de su puesto por Naciones Unidas cuando, frustrado por la falta de medidas de la organizacion en la que trabajaba hacia cerca de 30 anos, entrego a fiscales en Francia un documento confidencial de la ONU sobre las denuncias de abuso sexual.

Una menor de 14 anos relato a los investigadores de HRW: ""Pasaba por la base de Minusca en el aeropuerto cuando me atacaron. Los soldados estaba armados. Uno me sujeto los brazos mientras el otro me arranco la ropa. Me tiraron a un pastizal y mientras uno me agarraba el otro me violo"".

Otra joven de 18 anos fue violada cuando acudio a la base de cascos azules de la Republica Democratica del Congo para pedir algo de comida. ""Tres hombres armados se me tiraron encima y me dijeron que si los denunciaba me matarian. Me violaron uno a uno"", dijo la joven a HRW.

""Universo alternativo de la burocracia""

En diciembre del ano pasado un panel independiente acuso a Naciones Unidas de grave negligencia en el manejo de denuncias de abuso sexual por parte de soldados y personal en misiones de la ONU.

El panel critico duramente la falta de medidas por parte de Naciones Unidas ante un catalogo de denuncias, especialmente de explotacion sexual por parte de soldados franceses en Republica Centroafricana.

Image copyright GETTY Image caption El alto comisionado de la ONU para los derechos humanos, Zeid Raad Al Hussein, reconocio el ano pasado que su organizacion se demoro en pasar informacion a fiscales en Francia.

El general Romeo Dallaire, excomandante de las tropas de la ONU en Ruanda durante el genocidio, dijo el ano pasado que sentia repugnancia por las denuncias de abuso de menores en Republica Centroafricana. ""El caso va totalmente en contra de la razon por la cual se supone que llegan al terreno tropas en mision de paz"".

La inaccion de Naciones Unidas solo llego a la prensa internacional tras las revelaciones de un funcionario de la ONU, Anders Kompass, que frustrado ante la inaccion del organismo filtro un informe confidencial sobre denuncias de abuso y lo entrego a fiscales en Francia.

Refiriendose al nuevo informe presentado por Ban Ki-moon, Code Blue critico que el comite de expertos nombrado por la ONU para mejorar su actuacion ante denuncias de abuso esta integrado por los mismos individuos que ocupaban altos cargos de responsabilidad cuando se revelaron las violaciones anteriores.

Image copyright GETTY Image caption El informe presentado por Ban Ki-moon insta a crear un banco con muestras de ADN de los soldados de la ONU para facilitar los procesos criminales.

""En el universo alternativo de la burocracia de la ONU, los mismos personajes que tuvieron un papel activo en la debacle de Republica Centroafricana ahora supervisaran cambios para mejorar la situacion. Cuando los zorros estan a cargo del gallinero, el gallinero esta condenado"", dijo Code Blue en un comunicado.

La ONG recuerda en un comunicado las palabras del panel independiente que se pronucio tras el escandalo de los soldados franceses:

""El hecho de que el problema persista a pesar de innumerables informes de expertos comisionados por la ONU en los ultimos 10 anos, solo sirve para aumentar la percepcion de que la ONU esta mas preocupada con la retorica, que con la accion"".",[]

Sebuah teater kontemporer di pusat kota London, The Cockpit, menampilkan drama klasik Yunani, Hippolytos, yang dikemas dengan tari Bali dan Jaipongan, dibawah arahan Dr Margaret Coldiron, yang pernah belajar tari di Bali.

Drama Yunani dengan sentuhan Indonesia ini pertama kali ditampilkan tahun 1998 lalu dalam Konferensi Triennial Classics di Cambridge Inggris. Setahun kemudian ditampilkan di London, sebelum dibawa ke Siprus, dan Amerika Serikat.

Kemudian muncul gagasan menghidupkannya kembali untuk tahun 2016 dan persiapan pertunjukan di Teater The Cockpit London ini sudah dimulai sejak Bulan Desember 2015 dengan menggunakan naskah yang diadaptasi oleh Yana Zarifi dan Jamie Masters.

""Tidak ada kesulitan dalam mengkombinasikannya. Yang paling menyenangkan adalah mendapat 'persetujuan' dari para penonton, yang menikmatinya,"" jelas Dr Coldiron kepada wartawan BBC Indonesia, Liston Siregar.

""Akan senang sekali kalau drama ini juga bisa ditampilkan di Indonesia,"" tambahnya.

Dalam pengantar pertunjukan disebutkan tokoh dalam drama -dewa dan manusia- muncul dengan Topeng Bali sementara paduan suara untuk refrain menampilkan tari Jaipongan, sebuah tari kontemporer yang didasarkan pada tradisi tari rakyat Jawa Barat.

Menurut Dr Coldiron, ada kesamaan antara budaya klasik Yunani dan Bali, yaitu sama-sama memiliki banyak dewa.

""Keduanya juga sama dalam tradisi pertunjukan yang juga merupakan sebuah ritual.""

Considerado um dos paises mais igualitarios do mundo e pioneiro em iniciativas pro-imigrantes, a Dinamarca vem mostrando uma nova face ao instituir medidas mais rigidas para desestimular novas chegadas ao pais. E isso inclui decisoes polemicas como a restricao de uso de piscinas publicas ou casas noturnas por refugiados.

O rigido controle das fronteiras na Dinamarca foi estendido esta semana pela quarta vez no ano. Essa e apenas uma na lista de dezenas de restricoes contra o fluxo de solicitantes de asilo adotada pelo governo e encampada por grupos conservadores, como o Partido do Povo Dinamarques (PPD), cujo discurso anti-imigracao e contrario a Uniao Europeia garantiu-lhe historico sucesso nas ultimas eleicoes nacionais, em junho de 2015.

Confisco

Em janeiro, depois de meses de atuacao discreta na crise dos refugiados, a Dinamarca causou uma polemica internacional ao aprovar o confisco de dinheiro e bens de refugiados - joias e dinheiro em valor superior a 10 mil coroas dinamarquesas (R$ 5.500), para custear acomodacao daqueles que solicitam asilo no pais.

Segundo a Policia Federal, nenhum bem chegou a ser confiscado ate agora.

""A norma provavelmente sera apenas simbolica, ja que a maioria dos solicitantes de asilo nao carrega muitos bens de valor"", explica Andreas Kamm, secretario-geral do Conselho Dinamarques de Refugiados.

""Ela deve, infelizmente, ser vista a luz de uma corrida europeia rumo ao abismo, na qual os paises competem para parecerem o menos atraente possivel a refugiados e imigrantes"".

A medida faz parte de um pacote de 34 restricoes aprovadas nos ultimos meses pelo governo da Dinamarca. Uma das mais criticadas por grupos de defesa de direitos humanos e a extensao do prazo - de um para tres anos - para reunificacao dos familiares daqueles que conseguem asilo.

Image copyright EPA Image caption Dinamarca acolheu menos de 20% dos pedidos de refugio que recebeu

""Esta proposta e desumana"", critica Kamm, reforcando que ela vai contra o direito da familia instituido na Convencao Europeia de Direitos Humanos.

""A maioria das restricoes tem o objetivo de avisar que a Dinamarca nao deve ser vista como uma boa opcao para se pedir asilo, para assustar os refugiados. Comparado ao resto do mundo, o pais ainda esta entre os principais destinos de solicitantes de asilo, mas o governo esta tentando pregar que este nao e o caso, e mostrar para os eleitores que esta sendo duro"", afirma Michala Clante Bendixen, presidente da organizacao ""Refugees Welcome, Denmark"" e editora do site Refugees.dk.

Asilo

Entre 4 de janeiro e 1o de marco deste ano, com o controle de fronteiras em vigor, a Dinamarca recebeu 2.530 pessoas, segundo o Ministerio da Integracao.

Em 2015, foram registradas 20.935 solicitacoes no pais  1,5% do total de mais de 1,3 milhao em 28 paises da Uniao Europeia (UE). Ou 370 solicitantes de asilo por 100 mil habitantes (acima da media da UE, que foi de 260/100 mil), segundo a Eurostat, a agencia de estatisticas do bloco.

""Apesar de o numero de solicitantes de asilo ter diminuido com o controle de fronteiras, ele ainda e relativamente alto"", afirmou, em comunicado a ministra da Integracao, Inger Stojberg, ao justificar a extensao do prazo de reunificacao de familias.

""A Dinamarca esta diante de um serio risco as politicas publicas e a seguranca interna devido ao grande numero de imigrantes ilegais que pode chegar a Copenhague em um curto periodo de tempo"".

Mas o arrocho imigratorio vem sendo intensificado lentamente na Dinamarca desde 2001, quando o pais direcionou sua politica mais a direita a partir da ascensao do primeiro-ministro Anders Fogh Rasmussen.

Com a nova crise de refugiados, as restricoes foram reforcadas.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Pais aprovou lei que da poderes de confisco de dinheiro e joias de refugiados e migrantes

O PPD nao e o unico a defender o arrocho, mas se tornou o porta-voz da politica restritiva, depois de ter o melhor resultado na sua historia nas eleicoes de junho de 2015, quando conquistou o segundo lugar entre os partidos dinamarqueses, com 21% dos votos e 37 dos 179 assentos no Parlamento.

O partido defende o rigido controle das fronteiras de forma permanente, com o objetivo de evitar a entrada de ""contrabandistas e imigrantes ilegais"", segundo explicou seu porta-voz, Lars Ohlsen, a BBC Brasil.

Na visao do PPD, os refugiados representam uma potencial ameaca a identidade dinamarquesa e ao estado de bem-estar social conquistado pelo pais.

""A maioria nao e capaz de se integrar a Dinamarca. Dados mostram que, apos dez anos, apenas 25% dos refugiados que chegam ao pais conseguem emprego. E ainda ha o problema com os valores de alguns desses refugiados de paises nao ocidentais, pois geralmente sao muito distantes dos valores dinamarqueses"", defendeu Ohlsen.

'Guerra cultural'

Professor de Ciencias Politicas da Universidade de Copenhague, Lars Tonder critica que o PPD tem constantemente forcado ""os limites do que e aceitavel"". Segundo ele, o partido insiste que a Dinamarca deve decidir sozinha, rejeitando uma solucao europeia, como forma de reforcar ""o que e ser dinamarques"".

""Essa reivindicacao de soberania nacional esta relacionada a um estado de bem-estar social que se preocupa primeiro com os dinamarqueses e depois com os de fora. Agora outros partidos conservadores perceberam que eles devem seguir essa abordagem se quiserem ganhar as eleicoes"", avalia Tonder.

A Dinamarca foi pioneira em assinar, em 1951, a Convencao de Genebra, que estabeleceu politicas de apoio a povos refugiados, alem de ter ratificado outras convencoes subsequentes relacionadas ao tema.

Antes disso, o pais ja tinha merito pela defesa de minorias, por exemplo, por ter enviado uma operacao para resgatar judeus escandinavos presos em campos de concentracao durante a Segunda Guerra Mundial.

Image copyright Getty Image caption Populacao dinamarquesa esta dividida em relacao a politica de endurecimento

No entanto, o primeiro-ministro dinamarques, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, do partido Venstre, principal parceiro da coalizao de governo com o PPD, vem insistindo numa reforma na Convencao de Genebra, visando intensificar o controle de refugiados na Europa.

""O trafego de refugiados que ocorre neste momento deve terminar"", disse Rasmussen na semana passada a agencia dinamarquesa de noticias Ritzau.

A populacao dinamarquesa esta dividida. No caso da ""lei das joias"", como o confisco ficou conhecido, uma pesquisa conduzida pelo instituto YouGov mostrou que 38% apoiavam a norma, contra 39% discordantes.

No ultimo mes, protestos contra a austera politica de imigracao ocorreram em Copenhague. E grupos de direitos humanos vem promovendo campanhas de acolhimento.

Piscina

Enquanto isso, medidas e incidentes deixam claro o descontentamento de parte dos dinamarqueses com a presenca de refugiados.

A polemica mais recente a repercutir em veiculos do pais ocorreu na cidade sulista de Tonder, onde a direcao de uma piscina publica determinou horarios especiais de uso para solicitantes de asilo.

A decisao foi tomada apos usuarios se ""sentirem inseguros pelo comportamento violento"" dos estrangeiros, segundo informou o canal TVSyd.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Com raras excecoes, autoridades tem aumentado patrulhamento nas fronteiras

Procurada pela BBC Brasil, a direcao da piscina nao retornou os pedidos de entrevista, mas a TV afirmou que os novos usuarios nao seguiam as regras porque gritavam e nao tomavam ducha antes de entrarem na piscina.

Alem disso, diferentes boates de algumas cidades do pais passaram a restringir o acesso daqueles que nao falavam dinamarques, alemao ou ingles, apos mulheres reportarem terem se sentido assediadas por refugiados.

Em setembro de 2015, o Ministerio da Integracao publicou em jornais do Libano (onde ha grande massa refugiada vinda da Siria) anuncios divulgando as medidas restritivas contra refugiados.

As informacoes tambem divulgadas em dez linguas em centros de refugiados na Dinamarca e em midias sociais. Mas a iniciativa foi abortada apos criticas de que se tratava de uma forma de desestimular a aplicacao de refugio.

E ha pouco mais de um mes, o conselho de Randers, cidade da regiao central da Dinamarca, aprovou a obrigatoriedade de escolas publicas servirem carne de porco, uma iniciativa defendida pelo PPD para manter a identidade dinamarquesa  uma vez que e um dos principais ingredientes da culinaria no pais. Mas que, por outro lado, foi apontada por alguns setores como uma politica discriminatoria contra povos muculmanos.

""O que seria esta 'guerra da carne de porco' senao uma maneira de servir desigualdade e discriminacao sob o nome de diferenca cultural e religiosa?"", questionam os pesquisadores da Universidade de Aalborg, Susi Meret e Peter Hervik, em artigo publicado no site Open Democracy.

""Iniciativas como essas tem um impacto tanto em refugiados, quanto em imigrantes ja na Dinamarca, contribuindo para polarizar ainda mais o pais"", complementaram os pesquisadores, em entrevista por e-mail.",[]

Kejaksaan Agung Swiss membenarkan pada hari Rabu (09/03) bahwa aparat penegak hukum di Prancis melakukan penggeledahan terhadap kantor asosiasi sepak bola Prancis, FFF, di Paris.

Penggerebekan yang dilakukan Selasa (08/03) tersebut terkait dengan penyelidikan pidana terhadap mantan presiden organisasi sepak bola dunia FIFA, Sepp Blatter, yang tengah ditangani di Swiss.

Para petugas penegak hukum menyita sejumlah dokumen yang terkait dengan pembayaran oleh Blatter kepada presiden organisasi sepak bola Eropa UEFA, Michel Platini, senilai US$2 juta atau sekitar Rp26 miliar pada 2011 lalu.

Kasus pembayaran ini membuat Platini mengundurkan diri dari bursa pencalonan presiden FIFA.

Platini lebih banyak berkantor di Paris, bukan di kantor pusat FIFA di Zurich, saat menjadi penasehat Blatter pada 1999-2002.

Mantan pemain Timnas Prancis ini sedang menjalani skors dan Jaksa Agung Swiss, Michael Lauber, mengatakan bahwa Platini 'dalam posisi antara saksi dan tersangka'.

Sejauh ini dia secara resmi belum menjalani penyelidikan pidana.

Kantor berita Associated Press memberitakan bahwa untuk pertama kalinya dilakukan penyelidikan terhadap Blatter dengan lokasi di luar wilayah hukum Swiss.

En cuestion de semanas, la aeronave mas larga del mundo, el Airlander 10, efectuara su primer vuelo.

Su punto de despegue sera Cardington, un poblado de Bedfordshire, ciudad ubicada en el este de Inglaterra.

La aeronave mide 92 metros de largo, 18 metros mas que las otros dos gigantes de la aviacion comercial: el Airbus A380 y el Boeing 747-8.

Esta mezcla de avion, helicoptero y dirigible, lleno de helio, puede ademas aterrizar a control remoto practicamente en cualquier parte, incluso sobre el agua.

De hecho, no necesita de pista de despegue o aterrizaje y puede ser operado por una tripulacion de nada mas dos personas.

4 motores con los que cuenta

Basado en un diseno originalmente comisionado por el ejercito de EE.UU., este vehiculo hibrido quiere ser el primero de una nueva generacion de aeronaves silenciosas, energeticamente eficientes y que no afecten el medio ambiente.

Y la empresa Hybrid Air Vehicles tiene planeado lanzar la primera de una nueva generacion de aeronaves desde el Hangar 1, considerado el mas grande del Reino Unido.

Airlander 10 es uno de los proyectos mas ambiciosos de Hybrid Air Vehicles, que recibio un prestamo de US$4.8 millones por parte del gobierno britanico y otro de US$2.7 millones de la Union Europea.

Ademas recaudo US$3.3 millones en una campana de crowdfunding.

Hangar 1

Cardington es un lugar con historia en el desarrollo de aeronaves en el Reino Unido. De hecho, alli se fabrico el primer zepelin, en 1918.

En la decada de los anos 20, en esa localidad se construyeron varias aeronaves.

Image copyright Hybrid Air Vehicles Image caption El hangar 1 fue creado en 1917, el segundo se anexo en 1925.

El objetivo de Hybrid Air Vehicles es fabricar, para el 2021, diez Airlanders al ano, lo que significa que el Hangar 1 podria volver a hacer lo que fue su razon de ser: una base para hacer aeronaves.

De acuerdo con la compania, los Airlanders son ideales para transportar grandes cargamentos en zonas de desastres que carecen de aeropuertos.

Pese al optimismo que se siente entre los ingenieros y el personal que han trabajado en el Airlander, expertos en aviacion recuerdan lo que sucedio en 1937 y que paso a la historia como el Desastre de Hindenburg.

El dirigible aleman tipo zepelin quedo destruido tras incendiarse cuando aterrizaba en Nueva Jersey, Estados Unidos. 35 personas murieron.

Image copyright Hybrid Air Vehicles Image caption Los hangares de Cardington fueron construidos para los aviones britanicos de inicios del siglo XX.

""(...) el desastre del Hindenburg mato a la industria y el zepelin se convirtio en tabu"", senalo el historiador John Swinfield.

Sin embargo y en medio de llamadas para construir vehiculos menos contaminantes, 2016 parece ser un ano que promete ver el resurgir de los dirigibles, al menos de uno, el Airlander.

Y una gran diferencia es que, a diferencia de su antecesor, el Airlander no utiliza hidrogeno, un gas extremadamente volatil, sino helio no inflamable.",[]

Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva brillo tanto como presidente de Brasil entre 2003 y 2010, que varios medios extranjeros le dieron el titulo de personaje del ano y hasta el presidente de Estados Unidos, Barack Obama, lo llamo ""el politico mas popular del planeta"".

Pero ahora Lula es investigado en su propio pais por presuntos hechos de corrupcion que el niega y este viernes la policia fue a buscarlo a su casa, que resulto allanada, para someterlo a un interrogatorio de casi cuatro horas.

A los 70 anos, el exsindicalista sigue siendo una figura poderosa en Brasil, donde muchos lo ven como un potencial candidato presidencial para las elecciones de 2018.

Tras el interrogatorio en un aeropuerto de Sao Paulo, que fue calificado de show de ""pirotecnia"" por algunos medios, Lula aseguro que no teme nada y que esta resuelto a seguir con su actividad politica.

""Encendieron en mi la llama y la lucha continua"", dijo este viernes ante militantes del Partido de los Trabajadores (PT), la organizacion de izquierda que el mismo fundo y que aun gobierna Brasil, ahora con Dilma Rousseff en la presidencia.

Sin embargo, los senalamientos de la fiscalia brasilena suponen un duro golpe para Lula.

Los investigadores dijeron tener indicios significativos de que el expresidente recibio beneficios disimulados procedentes de la red de sobornos en la petrolera estatal Petrobras.

Y mencionaron dos posibles delitos que intentan comprobar: lavado de dinero y corrupcion.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Simpatizantes del Partido de los Trabajadores, el de Lula da Silva, mostraron su apoyo al ex presidente en Sao Paulo.

Este presente de Lula contrasta fuertemente con su pasado esplendoroso y arroja grandes dudas sobre su futuro, segun analistas.

""Su principal capital politico es la imagen, una imagen que era capaz de influir en las elecciones, y eso disminuyo bastante"", dijo a BBC Mundo Marco Antonio Teixeira, un politologo de la Fundacion Getulio Vargas, una universidad de elite en Sao Paulo.

""Consagrado""

Electo presidente luego de tres intentos previos fracasados, Lula supo devolverle a Brasil el sentimiento de grandeza que este pais otrora imperio habia perdido mucho tiempo atras.

Bajo su gobierno, la economia se expandio, decenas de millones de brasilenos ascendieron a la clase media y se descubrieron grandes reservas de petroleo que alentaron el sueno de desarrollo del gigante sudamericano.

En 2009 Lula fue nombrado ""personaje del ano"" por el periodico frances Le Monde y el espanol El Pais, y ""protagonista de la decada"" por el britanico Financial Times.

Al ano siguiente, cuando ya concluia su mandato, la revista estadounidense Time lo ubico como la personalidad mas influyente del mundo.

Como la Constitucion brasilena le impedia presentarse a un tercer mandato presidencial consecutivo, Lula senalo a Rousseff como su sucesora, algo a lo que aludio este viernes.

""Al elegir a Dilma crei que habia consagrado mi tarea"", comento.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Lula da Silva nombro como su sucesora a Dilma Rousseff y pensaba volver a la presidencia despues de ella.

Todo eso ocurria pese a un escandalo de compra de votos en el Congreso, denominado mensalao, que comprometia a colaboradores cercanos de Lula y a miembros del PT, que terminaron condenados.

Lula dejo la presidencia con su popularidad por las nubes y muchos brasilenos ya pedian que volviera al cargo despues de Rousseff.

""Sexo de los angeles""

El ex mandatario mantuvo una gran influencia sobre el gobierno de su sucesora mientras se dedicaba a dar conferencias en varios paises y a tareas del Instituto Lula, una entidad sin fines de lucro que creo en 2011.

Hoy esas actividades estan bajo la lupa de los investigadores del esquema de sobornos en la petrolera estatal Petrobras.

La fiscalia indico que hubo montos equivalentes a US$8 millones pagados al Instituto Lula y a una empresa creada en 2011 para conducir las conferencias del expresidente.

Image copyright Getty Image caption La investigacion de la corrupcion en Petrobras pone en duda las actividades del Instituto Lula.

Y agrego que los pagos fueron hechos por las mismas empresas constructoras involucradas en la corrupcion de Petrobras.

Los investigadores intentan determinar si las conferencias efectivamente ocurrieron y si el dinero aportado por las constructoras fue a cambio de eventuales beneficios que recibieron del gobierno.

El expresidente justifico el valor de sus conferencias en declaraciones formuladas tras el interrogatorio policial.

""Nadie queria que yo discutiera el sexo de los angeles. Las personas querian que Lula hablase de las cosas que hizo en Brasil"", dijo el mismo.

""Por eso me transforme en el conferencista mas caro del mundo junto con (el expresidente estadounidense) Bill Clinton"".

El instituto Lula emitio un comunicado asegurando que su financiamiento ""es semejante al de otras instituciones ligadas a otros expresidentes de Brasil"" y que las donaciones que recibio fueron ""legales y declaradas a las autoridades"".

""Pase a ser el mejor""

Los investigadores dijeron ademas que estaban analizando obras realizadas en dos inmuebles en el interior del estado de Sao Paulo para que fueran usufructuados por Lula.

Uno de ellos es un apartamento triplex en la localidad costera de Guaruja, que habria sido reformado y amueblado con piezas de lujo por parte de la constructora OAS, que vio como uno de sus antiguos ejecutivos era sentenciado en la causa Petrobras.

Aunque Lula niega que el apartamento sea de su propiedad, los fiscales senalaron que ""varias pruebas dicen lo contrario"", incluidos testimonios de la porteria, un sindico y dos ingenieros de OAS.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Un grupo de personas protesto contra Lula da Silva en Brasilia el viernes 4 de marzo.

La otra propiedad es una casa de descanso en la localidad de Atibaia, que fue reformada con financiamiento de OAS y la constructora Odebrecht, cuyo expresidente esta preso, asi como un empresario amigo de Lula.

Lula fue varias veces al lugar y los fiscales sospechan que la propiedad fue adquirida por el expresidente a traves de terceros, algo que el rechaza.

""Todo el mundo puede tener un amigo que tenga una casa de playa o un sitio, menos esta mierda de metalurgico aqui"", exclamo Lula tras el interrogatorio, aludiendo a su viejo trabajo de obrero.

Los investigadores senalaron que tambien analizan la mudanza en varios contenedores que Lula realizo al salir del palacio presidencial de Planalto, afirmando que fue financiada por OAS.

Asimismo, estan indagando pagos realizados por el Instituto Lula y la empresa de conferencias a companias que tienen como socios a hijos del expresidente.

Lula dijo sentirse ""indignado"" por las sospechas planteadas. ""Si la PF (Policia Federal) encontrase un real de desvio en mi conducta, yo no merezco ser de este partido"", senalo en la sede del PT.

Durante la jornada hubo momentos de tension cuando simpatizantes y criticos de Lula se manifestaron en Sao Paulo, con algunos choques violentos entre ellos.

Por la noche el expresidente participo de un acto en la sede del sindicato de empleados bancarios en Sao Paulo, donde hablo ante cientos de militantes de las adversidades que enfrento en su vida.

""Pase a ser el mejor presidente del mundo entero en el inicio del siglo XXI"", sostuvo y menciono acciones que tomo para los mas pobres, mientras en calles de Rio hubo caceroleos en su contra.

""Si quieren derrotarme, van a tener que enfrentarme en las calles de este pais"", sostuvo. ""Si alguien piensa que van a callarme con persecucion y denuncia, no sabe que yo sobrevivi al hambre"".

Salpicado por los escandalos y con la economia brasilena en una recesion feroz, Lula parece lejos del gran apoyo popular que tenia hace poco tiempo.

Sin embargo, las encuestas mostraban hasta hace unos dias que Lula tenia cerca de 20% de las intenciones de voto y los analistas creen que esa base creceria si logra quedar libre de sospechas.

""Si la coyuntura cambia y prueba que es inocente, el mito de heroe resurge"", afirmo el politologo Antonio Teixeira. ""Eso es lo que esta intentando mostrar, la imagen de alguien que esta siendo perseguido"".",[]

Dois anos apos a queda do aviao da Malaysian Airlines que fazia o voo MH370 investigadores ainda procuram destrocos e pistas das 239 pessoas que estavam a bordo.

O misterio da localizacao dos restos do aviao parecia estar perto de ser desvendado em julho do ano passado, com a descoberta de uma peca da aeronave na ilha de Reuniao - a mais de 3.700 km do lugar em que estavam sendo feitas as buscas.

Investigadores franceses confirmaram que o flaperon - parte da asa - encontrado pertencia ao Boeing 777. Mas depois disso nao houve mais grandes avancos nas buscas.

O voo, que ia de Kuala Lumpur para Pequim, desapareceu em 8 de marco de 2014, quando o controle de trafego aereo perdeu contato com a aeronave.

As buscas, lideradas pela Australia, estao varrendo uma area de 120 mil quilometros quadrados de leito do mar a cerca de 2.000 km de distancia da costa de Perth, usando drones submarinos e sonares operados por navios especializados.

Em dezembro de 2015, autoridades australianas disseram que haviam reduzido a area de buscas - e que estavam confiantes de estar no lugar certo.

O vice-premie da Australia, Warren Truss, disse que autoridades estavam ""otimistas"" de que os restos do aviao seriam achados.

O escopo da busca mudou muitas vezes desde que o aviao desapareceu por causa da incerteza sobre seus ultimos movimentos, mas a expectativa e que a operacao seja concluida - com ou sem o encontro dos destrocos - em meados de 2016.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Autoridades confirmaram que peca encontra em ilha no Indico era do aviao

A busca

Pela rota planejada, o aviao estaria viajando na direcao nordeste, sobrevoando Camboja e Vietna. Por isso, a busca inicial se concentrou no Mar da China Meridional, ao sul do Vietna.

Mas indicios captados por um radar militar sugeriram que o aviao havia mudado sua direcao bruscamente, indo para o oeste. As buscas, entao, que envolviam dezenas de navios e avioes, se voltaram para o mar a oeste da Malasia.

Novas evidencias revelaram, em 15 de marco de 2014, que o aviao fora desviado propositalmente cerca de uma hora apos a decolagem.

Apos a divulgacao da ultima comunicacao do MH370 com o satelite, uma semana apos o desaparecimento, a busca foi expandida para uma area de cerca de 4,5 milhoes de km quadrados, do Cazaquistao, ao norte, ate o sul do Oceano Indico. Isso cobria 11% do Oceano Indico e 1,5% da superficie da Terra.

No entanto, a partir de 16 de marco, imagens de satelites de possiveis destrocos e dados de monitoramento de autoridades da Malasia pareciam confirmar que o aviao havia caido no Indico, ao sudoeste da Australia.

Em 24 de marco, o primeiro-ministro da Malasia anunciou que dados de satelite mostravam que o aviao definitivamente havia caido nesta parte do oceano.

Outros possiveis destrocos foram vistos por satelites mas, em 28 de marco, a principal area de busca foi deslocada de novo, para mais perto da Australia, apos analise da velocidade do aviao e seu alcance maximo.

Entre 5 e 8 de abril, barcos australianos e chineses com equipamento sonar submarino detectaram sinais de ultrassom que acreditavam ser da ""caixa preta"" do aviao. Os sons pareciam ser a maior pista encontrada ate o momento e foram usaram para redefinir, mais uma vez, as areas de busca.

Mas de novo, em 29 de maio, houve mudanca nos planos: autoridades anunciaram que nao haviam encontrado nada e que aquela area poderia ser descartada.

Enquanto isso, autoridades da Malasia, com ajuda de especialistas internacionais em aviacao e satelites, continuaram tentando desvendar e explicar os movimentos do aviao.

Os australianos disseram acreditar que o aviao estava no piloto automatico quando caiu.

Em 26 de junho, eles anunciaram uma nova area de buscar perto de Perth. Essa operacao comecou em agosto e tentar completar uma varredura do leito do oceano. Esta busca esta prevista para ser encerrada no meio do ano.

Descoberta de destrocos

Em 29 de julho de 2015, um pedaco de aviao de 2 metros foi encontrado por voluntarios que limpavam a praia de Santo Andre, na ilha de Reuniao, perto de Madagascar, no Oceano Indico.

Tanto o primeiro-ministro da Malasia quanto autoridades francesas que participam da investigacao confirmaram que os destrocos sao do aviao.

Mas as autoridades nao modificaram a area de buscas, ja que os destrocos haviam sido levados por correntes maritimas.

Em dezembro, apos nova analise de dados, o governo da Australia se disse confiante de que estaria ""procurando na area certa"".

Em 27 de fevereiro de 2016, outro pedaco de uma aeronave foi encontrado em um banco de areia em Mocambique. O ministro dos Transportes da Malasia disse que havia uma ""alta possibilidade"" de o fragmento ser do aviao da Malaysian Airlines.

A Australia disse que a localizacao batia com os modelos de correntes maritimas que mostravam para onde os destrocos poderiam ter sido levados, mas investigadores nao confirmaram oficialmente que a peca seria do MH370.

Quem estava no voo

Os 12 tripulantes eram da Malasia, liderados pelos pilotos capitao Zaharie Ahmed Shah, de 53 anos, e o copiloto Fariq Abdul Hamid, de 27.

A policia fez buscas nas casas deles e um simulador de voo foi levado da casa do capitao e remontado para pericia.

Havia 227 passageiros, incluindo 153 chineses e 38 cidadaos da Malasia. Sete eram criancas.

Tambem havia passageiros do Ira, EUA, Canada, Indonesia, Australia, India, Franca, Nova Zelandia, Ucrania, Russia, Taiwan e Holanda.

Foi descoberto que dois iranianos estavam viajando com passaporte falso. Mas investigacoes mostraram que Pouria Nour Mohammad Mehrdad, de 19 anos, e Delavar Seyed Mohammadreza, 29, estavam a caminho da Europa via Pequim e nao tinham ligacoes conhecidas com grupos terroristas.

Entre os chineses no aviao havia um grupo de 19 artistas proeminentes, que haviam participado de uma exposicao em Kuala Lumpur.

bbc.com,,Maelezo ya Faragha,[],"Sera ya Faragha Maelezo yafuatayo yanaelezea sera yetu ya faragha kuhusiana na taarifa za mtu za kibinafsi ambazo tunakusanya kuhusiana na wewe.

1. Maelezo ya dhamira 2. Taarifa juu ya wageni 3. Cookie ni nini 4. Kuwasilisha maelezo ya mtu ya kibinafsi 5. Kupata maelezo yako ya kibinafsi 6. Watumiaji wenye umri wa miaka 16 au pungufu 7. Jinsi ya kutafuta na kudhibiti cookie zako 8. Utajuaje kurasa gazi zinatumie cookie? 9. Jinsi ya kuona alama ya cookie yako

1. Maelezo ya dhamira

Mara kwa mara, utaombwa kuwasilisha taarifa zako za kibinafsi (kwa mfano, jina na anuani ya email, nk) ili kupata au kutumia huduma zilizopo kwenye mtandao wetu. Huduma hizo ni pamoja na vijarida, mashindano, Batilisha Email, mazungumzo ya moja kwa moja, ubao wa ujumbe na uanachama BBCi.

Kwa kuandika maelezo yako kwenye nafasi zilizopo, unairuhusu BBC na mashirika yake yanayotoa huduma kukupatia huduma ulizoziomba. Kila unapotoa maelezo yako ya kibinafsi, tutahifadhi taarifa hizo kwa kuzingatia sera hii. Huduma zetu zimekusudiwa kukupatia taarifa unazotaka kupata. BBC itashughulika kulingana na sheria za sasa hivi na itadhamiria kutekeleza taratibu nzuri kabisa za sasa hivi za Internet.

2. Tarifa za wageni

Wakati wowote unapotembelea mtandao wa BBCi, kurasa unazoziona, pamoja na kitu kinachoitwa cookie, zinaingizwa kwenye kompyuta yako (angalia kipengee cha 3 kupata mengi juu ya hili). Karibu kurasa zote, kama siyo zote kabisa, zinafanya hivyo, kwa sababu cookies zinaiwezesha kampuni inayomiliki kurasa hizo kufanya vitu vingi vyenye manufaa, kama vile kujua kama kompyuta hiyo (na huenda mtumiaji wake) ametembelea ukurasa huo hapo awali. Hii inafanyika wakati mtumiaji huyo anarejea tena kwenye mtandao, kwa kuchunguza ili kuangalia na kuikuta cookie iliyoachwa hapo nyuma, wakati mtumiaji alipozuru mtandao mara ya mwisho.

Taarifa yoyote ambayo imetolewa na cookies inaweza kutusaidia kukupa wewe huduma bora na kutusaidia kuchunguza wasifa wa wageni wetu. Kwa mfano: kama ulipotembelea kurasa zetu mara ya mwisho, tuseme uliingia kwenye kurasa za elimu, basi tunaweza kukuta taarifa hizi kwenye cookie yako na kielelezo cha taarifa za elimu utakapoingia mara ya pili

RedSheriff, kampuni ya vipimo na utafiti, inakusanya data ambazo siyo za kibinafsi zinazowahusu wageni wanaozuru kurasa zetu kwa niaba yetu kwa kutumia cookies na alama ambayo imewekwa kwenye mtandao wetu. Cookies hizo na alama iliyopo kwenye mtandao vinatoa takwimu ambazo siyo za kibinafsi kuhusu ziara zilizofanywa kwenye kurasa zetu, muda uliotumika kuangalia ukurasa, njia zilizotumiwa na wageni hao kwenye mtandao, data zilizopo kwenye mipangilio ya skrini za wageni na taarifa nyingine za kawaida. BBC inatumia taarifa kama hizi, na zile zilizopatikana kwenye cookies nyingine zilizotumika kwenye mtandao huo kusaidia kuboresha huduma kwa watumiaji wake.

Kama unataka kuikataa cookie ya RedSheriff's, unaweza kutumia utaratibu uliowekwa hapo chini katika kipengee cha 7. Kuilemaza (kuiondoa) alama iliyowekwa kwenye mtandao, unapaswa kupeleka maombi yako moja kwa moja kwa privacy@redsheriff.com. Taarifa nyingine zaidi kuhusu taarifa za faragha za RedSheriff's yanaweza kupatikana katika http://www.redsheriff.com/6.0.0.htm.

3. Cookie ni nini?

Unapoingia kwenye mtandao kompyuta yako mara moja itapewa cookie. Cookies ni faili za maandishi zinazoitambulisha kompyuta yako kwa mtambo wetu wa mtandao unaohifahdi kumbukumbu zote (server). Cookies zenyewe hazimtambui mtumiaji, ila tu zinaitambua kompyuta iliyotumiwa. Makampuni mengi ya mtandao yanafanya hivyo wakati mtumiaji anapozuru kurasa zao ili kuweza kujua jinsi watu wanavyoingia na kutoka kwenye mtandao huo.

Cookies zeneywe zinachukua kumbukumbu za maeneo ya mtandao ambayo yametembelewa na kompyuta husika, na kwa muda gani. Watumiaji wanapata fursa ya kuzifanya kompyuta kuruhusu cookies zote, kuwafahamisha wakati ambapo cookie imetolewa, au kutopokea cookies wakati wowote ule. Hilila mwisho linamaanisha kwamba huduma fulani fulani za kibinafsi hazitaweza kutolewa kwa mtumiaji huyo.

NB: Hata kama hujaiweka kompyuta yako katika hali ya kuzikataa cookies, bado unaweza kusomasoma kwenye mtandao wetu bila kuandika jina lako, hadi hapo utakapojisalisha kutumia huduma za BBCi.

4. Matumizi na hifadhi ya taarifa zako za kibinafsi

Unapotoa taarifa zozote za kibinafsi kwa BBCi (kwa mfano, kwa ajili ya mashindano, huduma za jamii za BBCi (BBCi Community) au uanachama wa BBCi kisheria tunawajibika kwako katika kuangalia jinsi tunavyotumia data hizo. Tunapaswa kukusanya taarifa hizo kwa haki, hii inamaanisha kwamba tunalazimika kukuelezea jinsi tutakavyotumia data hizo (angalia matangazo kwenye kurasa husika ambazo zinakufahamisha kwa nini tunaomba maelezo hayo) na kukuambia kama tunataka upeleke taarifa hizo kwa mtu mwingine yeyote yule. Kwa kawaida, taarifa zozote zile unazozitoa kwa BBC zitatumika ndani ya BBC na watu wake wanaotoa huduma. Kamwe hazitapelekwa kwa mtu eyote yule nje yya shirika la BBC bila kupata idhini yako kwanza, isipokuwa tunapowajibika au tunaporuhusiwa kisheria kufichua taarifa hizo. Vile vile, kama unatuma au kupeleka maelezo yenye matusi au yasiyofaa juu ya BBCi au kwa BBCi na kama BBC itaona kwamba mwenendo huo ni mbaya na/au umerudiwa, BBC inaweza kutumia taarifa zozote zile zilizopatikana kuhusiana na wewe ili kukomesha mwenendo huo. Hii ni pamoja na kuwafahamisha watu wengine kama vile mwajiri wako, shule yako au kampuni inayotoa huduma za barua-pepe kuhusu yaliyomo kwenye maandishi yako au juu ya mwenendo wako.

Tutahifadhi taarifa zako za kibinafsi katika mitambo yetu katika muda wote ule ambao unatumia huduma yetu uliyoiomba, na tunaweza kuziondoa wakati lengo litakapotekelezwa, ama kwa upande wa uanachama wa BBCi utakapoamua kwamba hutaki tena kuendeleza usajili wako kama mwanachama wa BBCi. Hata hivyo kwa sababu za kiusalama, BBC inaweza kuhifadhi data za maandishi ya ujumbe (ikiwa ni pamoja na yaliyomo kwenye ujumbe, majina na wanachama, muda na tarehe) zilizotokana na matumizi ya huduma za jamii za BBCi (BBCi Community) kama vile Connector kwa muda wa miezi sita. Mahali ambako taarifa za kibinafsi zimehifadhiwa kwa ajili ya watu ambao bado hawajasajiliwa, lakini wameshiriki katika huduma nyingine za BBCi (kwa mfano vile mashindano), taarifa hizo zitahifahdiwa kwa kipindi kitakachoonekana kwamba kinafaa ili kuhakikisha kwamba huduma hizo zinaendeshwa vizuri. Tutahakikisha kwamba taarifa za kibinafsi zilizotolewa zinahifadhiwa vizuri katika hali ya usalama, kulingana na Sheria ya Kulinda Data ya mwaka 1998 (Data Protection Act 1998).

Kama umearifiwa kwenye mtandao wa BBCi kwamba taarifa zako zinaweza kutumiwa kuiwezesha BBC kuwasiliana na wewe kwa ajili ya huduma za kiutawala, hii inamaanisha kwamba BBC inaweza kuwasiliana na wewe kwa sababu kadhaa zinazohusiana na huduma uliyojiandikisha nayo. Kwa mfano, tunaweza kukupatia huduma ya kukukumbusha juu ya password yako au kukujulisha kwamba huduma husika imesimamishwa kwa matengenezo. Hatutawasiliana na wewe kwa ajili ya kutoa matangazo, kama vile kukujulisha juu ya kuboresha huduma zetu au juu ya vipindi vipya vya BBCi, isipokuwa kama unakubali bayana kwamba tuwasiliane nawe kwa malengo kama hayo wakati unapowasilisha taarifa zako kwenye mtandao, au baadaye kama utajiandikisha kwa madhumuni mahsusi ya kupokea taarifa kama hizo za matangazo.

5. Kupata taarifa zako za kibinafsi - Access to your personal information

Una haki ya kuomba nakala ya taarifa zako za kibinafsi zinazokuhusu ambazo BBC inazihifadhi na kusahihisha maelezo yoyote yenye makosa. (Tunatoza 10 (paundi 10) kwa maombi ya taarifa hizo.) Tafadhali peleka maombi yote kwa Data Protection Officer, BBC Regulatory Legal Department, Room 3637, White City, London W12 7TS (Email: dpa.officer@bbc.co.uk).

6. Watumiaji wenye umri wa miaka 16 au pungufu

Kama una umri wa miaka 16 au miaka pungufu ya hapo, tafadhali pata idhini kutoka kwa mzazi/mlezi wako wakati wote unapotaka kutoa maelezo yako ya kwenye mtandao wa BBC. Watumiaji ambao hawana idhini ya aina hiyo hawaruhusiwi kutupatia taarifa zao za kibinafsi.

We spoke to Producer, Lucy Bacon and Psychiatrist, Dr Farhana Mann about how they created 'Who would play you in a movie?'

Tell us about the pilot

Lucy Bacon: ""To coincide with the launch of movie award season were giving you the chance to find out who would play you in the movie of your life.



Through a set of questions were finding out about all aspects of your personality  and once youve answered each question well tell you which Hollywood A-Lister would take the lead role in your own biopic.""

So how did you calculate the results?

Lucy Bacon: ""Our personality questions are based on established research by University of Oregon professor Lewis R. Goldberg  and we worked with University College London psychiatrist Dr Farhana Mann to refine the test and personality profiles.

Film critic Rhianna Dhillion reviewed the personality profiles and matched these against Hollywoods great and the good.

As an added bonus  and something you wont find in your average online quiz  you can compare your scores to the rest of the country. Finding out where you fit in the grand scheme of things, when it comes to different aspects of your personality. We collated this data from over 1500 British people who completed a similar online quiz."" You can find out more about this here.

Whats the science behind the questionnaire...

Dr Mann: We based this project on questions from the International Personality Item Pool  and the widely cited Big Five personality test. (Goldberg, L. R. (1992). The development of markers for the Big-Five factor structure. Psychological Assessment, 4, 26-42.)



The development/discovery of these aspects of personality goes back to original research in the 1940s by psychologists like Raymond Cattel, Tupes & Cristal and Costa & Mcrae. Over time, other researchers have rigorously analysed the responses of thousands of people who were asked questions about their personalities/ways of doing things/approaching situations. The researchers pooled together all the information gathered and analysed it for patterns or traits/characteristics that tended to cluster together.



They found 5 main groups into which the data was consistently clustering together. And these groups were: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism or OCEAN. And thats what weve used to create this questionnaire.

And one final  very important note - this questionnaire isnt about diagnosing or labelling, its about finding out a little bit about yourself and having fun!

Cientistas rastrearam pela primeira vez a fonte de uma ""explosao rapida de radio"" - uma explosao fugaz de ondas de radio que, neste caso, veio de uma galaxia a 6 bilhoes de anos-luz de distancia.

A causa desse grande flash, apenas o 17o detectado na historia, ainda e um misterio, mas descobrir a galaxia de origem e um momento-chave no estudo desses fenomenos.

A equipe tambem conseguiu medir a quantidade de materia que entrou no caminho dessas ondas - fazendo, desta maneira, uma especie de ""pesagem do Universo"".

Os resultados do trabalho foram publicados na revista especializada Nature.

Despertar

Explosoes rapidas de radio (FRBs, na sigla em ingles) duram apenas milissegundos, mas lancam tanta energia no espaco - na forma de ondas de radio - quanto o nosso Sol emite em dias ou ate semanas.

Para rastrear a origem desse sinal especifico, uma equipe internacional fez um trabalho agil de detetive, com multiplos telescopios que acabaram conseguindo uma imagem da galaxia em luz visivel.

O coordenador do estudo, Evan Keane, programou um sistema de alarme para detectar essa enxurrada de atividade espacial, transmitindo dados em tempo real do radiotelescopio de Parkes, na Australia, a um supercomputador.

""O objetivo era reduzir o intervalo, de meses para nada, entre as ondas atingindo o disco (do telescopio) e ate sabermos desse impacto"", afirmou.

Deste modo, quando uma dessas explosoes misteriosas atingiu o famoso disco de 64 metros do radiotelescopio de Parkes, os alarmes soaram e e-mails rapidamente circularam pelo planeta.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption As primeiras explosoes rapidas de radio foram detectadas ha dez anos pelo telescopio Parkes.

A titulo de comparacao, a primeira explosao rapida de radio atingiu o mesmo equipamento em 2001, mas so foi reportada em 2007.

""Ha uma decada, nao estavamos de fato procurando essas ondas - e a nossa capacidade de manusear esses dados e busca-los em tempo habil era muito mais restrita"", afirma Keane.

""Ja nessa ultima vez eu fui acordado por varios telefonemas segundos depois de o fato ter ocorrido, com pessoas gritando: 'acorde, houve uma FRB!""

Duas horas depois, os seis discos de 22 metros de outro telescopio da Australia, o Compact Array, a cerca de 400 km de Parkes, ja estavam em busca do pedaco do ceu responsavel pela explosao.

Eles identificaram um resquicio da explosao, que demorou seis dias para desaparecer. Era muito mais fraca do que a explosao em si, mas permitiu a equipe ampliar a fonte da explosao com precisao mil vezes maior do que antes.

Sabendo exatamente para onde olhar, a equipe passou a fazer buscas em luz otica, usando o telescopio Subaru no Havai, gerenciado pelo Observatorio Astronomico do Japao.

Image copyright David Kaplan Evan Keane Image caption O sinal de radio (no destaque em preto e branco) chega em diferentes momentos e em diferentes comprimentos de onda.

""Bem no ponto onde o Compact Array disse que poderia haver algo, havia uma galaxia"", disse Keane.

Uma analise detalhada dos dados do Subari revelou que a galaxia era eliptica - um agrupamento nao-esferico de estrelas longe de seu auge, em termos galacticos.

Peso cosmico

""Isso nao e o que esperavamos"", afirmou o coautor do estudo Simon Johnston, chefe de astrofisica do orgao que opera os telescopios na Australia.

Se a galaxia de origem e velha, entao e mais provavel que a explosao tenha sido causada por uma fusao de estrelas mortas do que, por exemplo, pelo brilho de uma supernova, corpo celeste normalmente originado da explosao de uma estrela de alta massa.

""Pode significar que a FRB pode resultar da colisao de duas estrelas de neutrons, mais do que algo que tenha a ver com o nascimento de estrelas"", disse Johnston, para quem a descoberta apenas ""abre o caminho"" da pesquisa sobre a causa dessas explosoes.

Eventos estelares

Image copyright Getty Images

Apesar de especulacoes ocasionais, astronomos sao confiantes ao afirmar que as explosoes rapidas de radio tem origem em eventos estelares extremos, e nao em civilizacoes alienigenas.

Mas radiotelescopios vasculham os ceus ha decadas e alguns de seus achados sao dificeis de explicar.

Ter uma imagem otica de uma galaxia permite a astronomos calcular sua distancia da Terra, a partir da alteracao da frequencia da luz (redshift, na expressao em ingles) quando observada em funcao da velocidade relativa entre a origem e o observador.

Com essa distancia estimada, a equipe pode fazer exercicios em cosmologia.

Em uma explosao rapida de radio, explica Keane, os comprimentos de onda curtos chegam primeiro do que os longos.

""Isso se da porque o sinal colide com particulas e poeira cosmica no caminho, o que causa um ligeiro atraso. Mas se voce viaja 6 bilhoes de anos-luz, o atraso se acumula. Se temos um segundo de atraso na jornada, significa que o sinal passou por muitas particulas.""

Entao os pesquisadores usaram, pela primeira vez, um sinal remoto de radio para calcular a densidade da porcao do cosmos no caminho. ""E basicamente como pesar o Universo.""

A pesagem cosmica da equipe teve um resultado interessante para o modelo atual de entendimento do Universo. Correspondeu a quantidade de coisas que esperamos da fatia de 5% do Universo que deve, de fato, ser materia.

Os outros 95% (25% de materia escura e 70% de energia escura, supoe-se) sao um misterio conhecido. Mas na verdade apenas metade da materia que deveria estar nesses 5% conhecidos ja foi detectada por telescopios.

A fatia restante ja foi denominada como ""desaparecida"".

""Toda materia causa um atraso no sinal de uma explosao rapida de radio - tanto a metade que vimos como a que nao vimos"", diz Keane.

""Entao medimos esse atraso, e se voce estimar quanta materia deve estar ali para causa-lo, tudo fica certo. A materia desaparecida nao estara sumida mais.""",[]

bbc.com,2016-02-23 00:00:00,The holy grail of ramen dishes,['Danielle Demetriou'],"I watched without blinking as a row of six hands performed a bullet-fast dance: a splash of soy sauce, a shower of condiments, a high-speed ladle of stock, a flamboyant shake of drained noodles and a final flick of garnish. The gracefully choreographed culinary performance was finished in seconds  before a further set of puppet-like hands whisked away the bowls and the dance began once again.

I had to squeeze next to the small restaurants cash register in order to see this dance in the cramped, narrow kitchen. It was a humble setting  but its one that produces one of Japans most revered culinary creations: the nations very best ramen.

Served in more than 24,000 restaurants across the country, ramen is increasingly revered for its culinary complexity, from the depth of the broth to the perfect bite of the noodles. Its the culinary embodiment of the eternal Japanese quest for harmony, beauty and balance. And in December 2015, the dish received the ultimate culinary accolade when Tsuta, a humble backstreet ramen restaurant in Tokyos Sugamo district, received a Michelin star.

But the peoples choice of ramen, consistently named Japans tastiest in magazines, TV shows and specialist food blogs for more than a decade, is consumed far from the capital, in the less predictable confines of a tiny, family-run noodle shop in Wakayama City  a part of Japan that Michelin doesnt even cover.

Ide Shoten was catapulted from culinary anonymity on 1 January 1998. Out of tens of thousands of ramen restaurants, it was picked as the countrys most delicious during a high-profile New Years Day broadcast of the popular television show, TV Champion.

This high-level proclamation paved the way for the restaurants soaring popularity (even today, there are 30-minute queues every weekend) and is widely credited with sparking a ramen boom across Wakayama City.

As for the secret to Ide Shotens competition-slaying popularity, the list of reasons cited by fans is as long as it is appetite-whetting: the rich fusion of long-stewed pork bones and soy sauce; the fine balance of flavours in the broth; the thin and straight noodles; the deep flavour of the chashu (roast pork).

As a noodle-loving Tokyo resident, it was only a matter of time before I found myself on a pilgrimage to the coastal city, south of Osaka, to taste the holy grail of ramen dishes.

Im not the first person to head to Wakayama on a near-spiritual mission, and I am unlikely to be the last. Wakayama Prefecture  a heady sprawl of wild mountains, hidden temples and old shrines  has long been famed for the ancient pilgrim trails that sprawl across its rural landscape.

Pilgrimages of the ramen variety, however, are also on the up  as reflected by the fact that Wakayama Citys enterprising tourism office has produced an illustrated ramen map. Its just as well, because visitors lured by ramen, known locally as chuka-soba (Chinese noodles), are spoilt for choice. There are more than 50 ramen restaurants in the city, which is no mean feat for a place with just 360,000 residents.

I arrived at Wakayama station on an icy-cold morning with big expectations and an empty stomach, four hours after setting off on my noodle odyssey from a pre-sunrise Tokyo. Ramen map or not, Ide Shoten was easy to find: a straight-forward 10-minute stroll from the station, identifiable by a red paper lantern and old yellow-and-red shop sign.

The facade  at first sight, more rundown hardware store than celebrated restaurant  was as low key as its interior. The cosy space, with 10 counter seats surrounding a small eight-seat table in the middle, was imbued with a vintage feel thats common in local Japanese restaurants: plastic red counters, a retro-looking wall clock, a humming, self-service water machine by the door. Baskets of boiled eggs and clingfilm-wrapped mackerel sushi sat on the tables (a Wakayama ramen tradition), and the walls were covered in messages from famous customers.

At 11:30 am on a nondescript Tuesday morning, the just-opened shop was already humming with customers. Sitting at the central communal table, I was surrounded by suited salarymen, solitary students and Chinese holidaymakers.

Just as my mouth started watering, the owner Norio Ide  a friendly 73-year-old with short grey hair, glasses and a wide smile  rushed to greet me and sat down for a quick chat.

I hated ramen noodles when I was a child, he laughed. My mother used to sell it on a yatai (street cart) and I was embarrassed about this in front of my friends. So I disliked ramen for a long time.

However, after an eclectic string of jobs  from logistics driver to gas deliveryman  he eventually followed in his mothers footsteps by taking over her business and opening the restaurant 30 years ago.

Today, fuelled by the awards and resulting media coverage, between 600 and 1,000 bowls of ramen are served daily to customers, 70% of whom come from outside the region, from southern Okinawa to northern Hokkaido and across Asia.

Most people come to sample an iconic bowl of tonkotsu-shoyu (pork bone and soy sauce), one of the two main types of Wakayama ramen (the other has a lighter shoyu (soy sauce) broth).

As I probed Ide about his restaurants popularity, he was modestly non-committal about the gold-star techniques that have transformed his humble broth into the stuff of ramen dreams.

Well, we keep adding to the same broth base every day, building on the flavour, so that makes it very deep, he said . Um. Thats it, really. I simply make noodles with my heart.

As I continued questioning him, he laughed at my use of the word artform. Its more simple than that, he said. Weve been lucky. I honestly just do the same thing every day.

The cacophony of satisfied slurping  was making me hungry, so I ordered lunch. The menu, written on the wall, could not have been simpler: chuka-soba for 700 yen, with 100-yen options of extra chashu or noodles.

I opted for a no-frills chuka-soba, and in less than a minute, was served a steaming white ceramic bowl of Japans finest ramen.

I was immediately struck by the colour: the broth was a rich and earthy orange, and tasted as deep and complex as it looked. It was decidedly rich with strong pork hints (much thicker than the Michelin-starred Tokyo ramen soup), yet managed to be complex without being too heavy.

Firm noodles supported the strong flavour, which was balanced with three thin slivers of chashu, refreshing coils of green onion, a pink fish cake and a palate-cleansing clutch of pickled bamboo shoots.

Slipping into the formal pose of ramen eaters, I tilted my head over the bowl and raised my chopsticks  and the next 10 minutes passed in a blur of sips, slurps and contented sighs as I devoured the delicious concoction.

I was not alone in my appreciation. Shinichi Masuko, 49, a sharply suited salarymen from Osaka sitting at the same table, said, Ive been here six times. You could say Im an addict. Its the soup I love most. Such a complex flavour.

Bearing in mind the queue, however, there was no time to chat  and after bidding farewell to Ide, I headed into the drizzling rain with a warm post-ramen glow.

But before getting the train back to Tokyo, there was one last thing to do. I took a short drive to Marina City  a waterside complex with an expansive food market  where I picked up a bag of the regions famed mikan (mandarin oranges) plus the ultimate souvenir: an Ide Shoten ramen kit, complete with packs of soft noodles and silver pouches of soup broth to replicate the dream dish at home.

Finally, I headed to the complexs natural hot spring onsen. Here, with a belly full of ramen, I lowered myself into the steaming outdoor bath and soaked up the sea view: perhaps the ultimate way to savour  and digest  a pilgrimage to the spiritual heartland of Japans ramen world.

bbc.com,,Why a story about bulk shipping matters to the global economy,"['Karishma Vaswani', 'Asia Business Correspondent']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption China is buying less from the world and that's having a knock on effect on everyone - from Australia to Indonesia.

When China's economy was growing at double digits, businesses ranging from coal-mines to shipbuilding decided it was the only game in town, and that this was the only strategy worth pursuing.

'The China story', or the 'Look East' policy. All part of the same narrative.

Sometimes when I read reports that forecast doom and gloom for a particular industry based on falling Chinese demand, I feel like shaking my head.

China has been broadcasting for some years now that its economy is transitioning and rebalancing, moving away from fixed asset investment to an economy that depends on services and consumption.

One wonders why the supermen of the shipping industry thought that China's economic boom was going to last forever, or that the super-cycle in commodities would go on and on and on...

The latest report from IHS on the dry bulk shipping industry tells a similar story.

What is dry bulk, you ask?

Image copyright Cameron Spencer Image caption Bulk carriers are designed especially to move bulk cargo like coal, ore and grains

Dry bulk is all that stuff that China needed as its economy grew at 9% to 10% - coal, iron ore, grain, steel - it's the transportation of that stuff across the world on massive ships, that's called the dry bulk trade.

No surprises here, IHS projects one of the worst years on record for the industry, on the back of falling Chinese demand.

The most recent Chinese import data confirms the doom and gloom.

China is buying less from the world, and that's having a knock on effect on everyone - from Australia to Indonesia.

IHS says that in 2015 China bought a third less coal, and Indonesia - one of its key suppliers - saw the amount of coal it sold drop by 40%.

Not great for all of those investors in Indonesian coal mines.

So, why should you care about the dry bulk shipping industry?

Media caption Video explainer on Baltic Dry Bulk Index

It is a key gauge of global trade and tells you how much it costs to move stuff around the world.

And here's the thing - the dry bulk index - also called the Baltic Dry Bulk Index - saw a peak of 11,000 points in May of 2008, just before the global financial crisis.

This year it has hit fresh record lows and skirted around the 300 points mark.

What this tells you is that global trade is nowhere near the levels it was pre-2008.

So the 'green shoots of recovery' you hear policy-makers and economists talking about, that's not being seen on the global shipping routes or lanes.

Countries are trading with each other far less than they used to because demand is down, and much of the growth we have seen since 2008 has been fuelled by government stimulus, investment and debt - and expectation that this growth would last forever.

And perhaps nowhere are the ghosts of those expectations seen more starkly than in the global shipping industry.

""It would be safe to presume that the market's failed expectations were the main problem for dry bulk shipping,"" says IHS.

""There were a large number of orders in 2012 and 2013, booked on the premise that there would be a continuation of China's commodities super-cycle driven by China's economic boom. This is simply no longer the case.""

Meses depois, a jovem percebeu que estava gravida. ""Tentei muitas vezes me livrar da crianca dentro de mim, tomando pilulas ou carregando muito peso, entre outras coisas. Infelizmente, nao funcionou"", diz ela.

""Estava carregando o EI no ventre e (sentia) que o bebe seria como eles, um criminoso e um monstro.""

bbc.com,,Desperation fuels Europe's zeal for migration deal,"['Europe Editor', 'Katya Adler']","Image copyright EPA Image caption There is desperation on all sides of Europe's migration crisis - desperate migrants are posing a problem which European politicians are desperate to solve

""Where there's a will, there's a way,"" Angela Merkel has insisted since the migration crisis exploded across Europe last year.

For months she's resisted closing her country's borders and setting an upper limit on the number of asylum seekers allowed into Germany despite rising, and at times frantic, public and political pressure to do so, including from within her own CDU party.

Iron Angie - as she's sometimes known at home - demonstrated her unwavering determination once again at yesterday's EU-Turkey summit and in the lead-up to it.

There have been dark mutterings in the German media that, despite increasing problems at home linked to the arrival of over a million asylum-seekers, the German chancellor has spent more time in Ankara than Aachen, Berlin or Cologne of late.

But there was stubborn purpose behind the shuttling.

Mrs Merkel's political future - and her legacy, after a decade as German chancellor - are hanging in the balance.

Big and bold

She faces three key regional elections this weekend, with polls predicting huge gains for the anti-immigrant AfD party.

She needed something big and bold on migration, allowing her to avoid performing an awkward U-turn on her national policies but at the same time sending a clear message to the people of Germany that she has the situation in hand.

Image copyright AFP Image caption Iron Angie has resisted pressure to dilute her liberal approach to migration - but knows her future hangs in the balance

Make no mistake - it was Germany and no other European nation that insisted on a summit with Turkey this week.

Turkey is key to resolving Europe's current migration chaos. That's where most refugees and others jump on board people smugglers' dinghies, risking their lives to enter Europe via the Greek islands.

But trust between Turkey and the EU is not strong. An ""action plan on migration"" between the two back in November failed to yield many results.

There has been little sign of Turkey cracking down on people-smugglers along its coastline, and limited evidence of the 3bn (2.3bn; $3.3bn) the EU then promised Turkey in humanitarian aid.

So Mrs Merkel began a new push for what she hoped would be a better Turkish deal.

Donald Tusk, the head of the European Council, which represents all EU member countries in Brussels, joined in the efforts (after all, he would be the summit host), flying to Turkey ahead of Monday's meeting.

But neither of these seasoned politicians were quite prepared for what is now being described as a ""Turkish bazaar"" here in Brussels.

Turkey's Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu arrived at the summit all smiles for the cameras.

""Turkey is ready to work with the European Union,"" he beamed - omitting to say at what price.

Then, behind closed doors, he slammed the EU with a whole host of additional political and funding demands:

More money - at least another 3bn euros to help with the more than 2.5 million refugees already in Turkey

The resettlement of one Syrian from Turkey to the EU for every Syrian readmitted by Turkey from Greece (the EU now hopes to send all migrants arriving on the Greek islands, including Syrians, back to Turkey)

Faster access to visa-free travel in most of the EU for Turkish citizens

The re-opening of stalled talks on Turkey's bid for EU membership

Even a few months ago, my bet is that faced with this steep list of demands, EU countries would simply have turned their back and walked out.

Not now.

Chancellor Merkel isn't the only one desperate to solve the migrant crisis: The EU's credibility is crumbling, its members have never looked less unified and Greece, stuck with tens of thousands of stalled migrants on top of being saddled with crippling euro debt repayments, threatens to implode.

The bottom line, for the EU, is to put off anybody and everybody from getting in dinghies or trying any means possible to get to Europe to improve their lives. It hopes to send every economic migrant back home and to pay to look after refugees in camps closer to theirs.

Image copyright Reuters Image caption Turkey, which borders Iraq and Syria, is on the frontline of the crisis - and Europe hopes may hold the key to tackling it

Voters across Europe say they are spooked by the migrant crisis. But however much Europe's leaders and EU bosses in Brussels fear for their future, they can't compromise all their principles trying to make this problem ""go away"".

And that is why last night's summit didn't end in a deal. Of course, triumphant words flew out of the mouths of leaders and broadcasters across Europe - ""turning point"", ""Big Bang"" and ""breakthrough"".

Step too far?

But that is only if - and it's a big if - the proposals are written up and signed at another migrant summit next week - and ""if"" they are then implemented.

There's a lot to think about.

Can the EU afford to close its eyes to the Turkish president's increasingly autocratic and arguably anti-democratic behaviour in its rush to do a migration deal?

Just before the summit, the Turkish government took over one of the country's best-selling newspapers and tear-gassed outraged protesters on the streets of Ankara, for example.

And what of the legal implications of the EU exporting migrants en masse back to Turkey?

The UN has warned this could go against international humanitarian law, with some asylum cases needing to be heard here in Europe, they say. Turkey does not have asylum laws in place for Afghans and Iraqis for example, so what will happen to those migrants?

And then there are the logistical challenges.

Imagine the scenes - not just young men, but old women, wheelchair users, pregnant mothers and screaming babies, many from Syria and other troubled areas. After all they've been through to to get to Greece, will they meekly accept getting on a boat or plane to be sent back to Turkey?

And these are just some of the complications surrounding an EU-Turkey deal, never mind the splits in Europe over how to deal with the migrant crisis.

So, on Monday Angela Merkel got what she needed for her weekend elections: a tough-sounding something with the promise of a Turkey deal in the offing.

Conveniently for her, the votes will be counted in Germany before the talk from the summit begins to publicly unravel.",[]

bbc.com,,'Stunning' operation regenerates eye's lens,"['Bbc News Website', 'Health Editor', 'James Gallagher']","Image copyright SPL Image caption The therapy was tested on children, but early trials on elderly people are ""very encouraging"" too.

A pioneering procedure to regenerate the eye has successfully treated children with cataracts in China.

More than half of all cases of blindness are caused by cataracts - the clouding of the eye's lens.

An implanted lens is normally needed to restore sight, but the operation described in Nature activated stem cells in the eye to grow a new one.

Experts describe the breakthrough as one of the finest achievements in regenerative medicine.

The lens sits just behind the pupil and focuses light on to the retina.

About 20 million people are blind because of cataracts, which become more common with age - although some children are born with them.

Conventional treatment uses ultrasound to soften and break up the lens, which is then flushed out.

An artificial intraocular lens must then be implanted back into the eye, but this can result in complications, particularly in children.

Image copyright SPL Image caption Close up of a cataract clouding the normally transparent lens

The technique developed by scientists at the Sun Yat-sen University and the University of California, San Diego removes the cloudy cataract from inside the lens via a tiny incision.

Crucially it leaves the outer surface - called the lens capsule - intact.

This structure is lined with lens epithelial stem cells, which normally repair damage.

The scientists hoped that preserving them would regenerate the lens.

The team reported that tests on rabbits and monkeys were successful, so the approach was trialled in 12 children.

Within eight months the regenerated lens was back to the same size as normal.

The study is one of the finest achievements in the field of regenerative medicine until now Dr Dusko Ilic, King's College London

Dr Kang Zhang, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: ""This is the first time an entire lens has been regenerated. The children were operated on in China and they continue to be doing very well with normal vision.""

It also showed a dramatically lower complication rate ""by almost every measure, supporting the superiority of the treatment"".

However, he says larger trials are needed before it should become the standard treatment for patients.

The procedure was tried in children because their lens epithelial stem cells are more youthful and more able to regenerate than in older patients.

Yet the overwhelming majority of cataracts are in the elderly.

Dr Zhang says tests have already started on older pairs of eyes and says the early research ""looks very encouraging"".

Commenting on the findings, Prof Robin Ali from the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, said the work was ""stunning"".

He told the BBC News website: ""This new approach offers greatly improved prospects for the treatment of paediatric cataracts as it results in regeneration of a normal lens that grows naturally.""

He said getting similar results in adults ""is likely to be more difficult to achieve"" but could ""have a major impact"".

""It might be superior to the artificial lenses that are currently implanted, as the natural lenses should be able to accommodate looking at different distances more effectively,"" he added.

Dr Dusko Ilic, a reader in stem cell science at King's College London, said: ""The study is one of the finest achievements in the field of regenerative medicine until now.

""It is science at its best.""

Far-reaching

Dr Zhang believes that targeting stem cells already sitting in the eye could have ""great potential"" for treating a wide range of diseases from macular degeneration to glaucoma.

A separate study by Osaka University in Japan and Cardiff University, used stem cells to mirror the development of the eye.

They were able to produce a range of specialised eye tissues including those that make the cornea, conjunctiva, lens and retina.

The findings, also published in Nature, showed the lab-grown tissues could restore sight to rabbits with corneal blindness.

One of the researchers, Prof Andrew Quantock, said: ""Our work not only holds potential for developing cells for treatment of other areas of the eye, but could set the stage for future human clinical trials of anterior eye transplantation to restore visual function.""

Macedonia has said it will no longer let any migrants through its border with Greece, effectively blocking the Balkan route north.

The decision came after Slovenia barred access to migrants transiting the country. Croatia and Serbia then said they would follow suit.

Some 13,000 migrants are now stranded at the Macedonia-Greece border.

The moves come after the EU and Turkey set out a plan to ease Europe's biggest refugee crisis since World War Two.

Media caption Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei visited the camp on Wednesday

Under the plan, still to be finalised, all migrants arriving in Greece from Turkey would be sent back. For each Syrian returned, a Syrian in Turkey would be resettled in the EU.

Announcing the plan on Monday, European Council President Donald Tusk, said there would no longer be a path to Europe for migrants. ""The days of irregular migration to Europe are over,"" he said.

In another development, leading international non-governmental organisations accused the French government of planning to close a purpose-built camp for refugees and migrants outside the French town of Dunkirk.

The newly-opened site has been described as the first in France to meet international standards, and provides shelter, food, sanitation and medical care for almost 1,200 people, but officials have said they are concerned about security and potential fire hazards.

But Macedonia began to limit the numbers, first to Syrian, Afghan and Iraqi migrants, then recently to just a trickle - mainly Syrians from areas it considered conflict zones.

This created a bottleneck, with migrants now living in a sprawling camp at the Idomeni crossing.

Macedonia's announcement came after Slovenia said late on Tuesday that it would allow in only migrants who planned to seek asylum in the country, or those with clear humanitarian needs.

Slovenian Prime Minister Miro Cerar said the country's move meant that ""the Balkan route for illegal migration no longer exists"".

In related moves:

Serbia said it would close its borders with Macedonia and Bulgaria to those without valid documents because it could ""not afford to become a collection centre for refugees""

Croatia said it would close its borders to migrants as a ""new phase in resolving the migrant crisis""

Sebastian Kurz, the foreign minister of Austria, welcomed ""the end of the 'waving through' [of migrants] which attracted so many migrants last year and was the wrong approach""

Hungarian Interior Minister Sandor Pinter said he would send more police and soldiers to patrol the country's southern borders and would make preparations to erect a fence along its border with Romania - if necessary within 10 days

The BBC's Europe correspondent, Chris Morris, says other countries such as Albania and Bulgaria will be wary of attracting attention as alternative routes for refugees and smugglers alike.

There is also concern, he adds, that there could be a renewed flurry of smuggling activity before any proposed deal between the EU and Turkey comes into force.

The closure of the Balkan route had clearly been on the agenda of the EU-Turkey summit on Monday, which ended without a deal.

A draft statement had declared the route closed although the final wording was changed after Germany objected.

The main thrust of the EU-Turkey plan is the one-in, one-out proposal for Syrian migrants.

There have already been objections. The UN expressed concern at the plan on Tuesday, while Amnesty International called it a death blow to the right to seek asylum.

Speaking to the BBC, Thorbjorn Jagland, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, said the proposal to send migrants back would contravene international law.

Talks between the EU and Turkey will continue ahead of an EU meeting next week.

What's in the EU-Turkey proposal?

The EU heads said ""bold moves"" were needed, and made the following proposals:

All new irregular migrants crossing from Turkey to Greece will be returned to Turkey. Irregular migrants means all those outside normal transit procedures, ie without documentation.

In exchange for every returned Syrian, one Syrian from Turkey will be resettled in the EU

Plans to ease access to the EU for Turkish citizens will be speeded up, with a view to allowing visa-free travel by June

EU payment of 3bn ($3.3bn; 2.2bn) promised in October will be speeded up, with the possibility of further aid to help Turkey deal with the crisis. Turkey reportedly asked for the sum to be doubled

Preparations will be made for opening new chapters in talks on EU membership for Turkey

A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries such as Syria, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.",[]

bbc.com,2016-02-18 00:00:00,Is NYCs most iconic sandwich  dying?,['Charley Lanyon'],"The deli, they say, is dying. Theyre not talking about the corner markets or bodegas that appear on nearly every New York block. Theyre talking about the true New York City delicatessen: the brick and mortar expression of the American immigrant experience, the very culinary soul of the city. And unfortunately, where there used to be thousands, only a few remain.

More than 100 years ago, in the second half of the 19th Century, New Yorks tenements were swelling with new arrivals from Europe. Many thousands of these immigrants were Jewish, escaping persecution in Eastern Europe and Russia, and most settled in New Yorks chaotic Lower East Side. They carried with them their religious beliefs and culinary culture  and often very little else.

Their food was the food of the Eastern European peasantry  smoked sausages and cured meats, smoked cabbage and offal stews and dark bread, salted fish and boiled dumplings. Their dining habits were moulded through poverty, harsh winters and religious rules. Under kosher law, pork was forbidden, and dairy, fish and meat had to be strictly separated. When Jewish immigrants set up shop in New York, this separation was reflected in three types of businesses: dairies for the milk, appetizing stores for the fish and delicatessens for the meat.

Soon, delis were a hit and there was one on every corner of the Lower East Side. But since World War II ended, the neighbourhood became crime-riddled, later turned into a hotbed of intensive gentrification and finally settled as the hip warren of trendy eateries it is today, all the while shedding small local business like the deli. Now in the old neighbourhood, only one old-school deli is left: Katz's Delicatessen on the corner of Houston and Ludlow.

Having survived rent hikes and employing shrewd business tactics, the 128-year old deli is perennially packed; Katzs sells more than 10,000 pounds of pastrami a week, and more than 12,000 hot dogs. Their signature sandwich  thick hand-cut slices of pastrami served on rye bread with mustard  is justifiably world famous.

This media cannot be played on your device.

Today this final holdout of the old ways is in the hands of Jake Dell, a 28-year-old self-described Prince of Pastrami and third-generation deli man, who took over from his uncle and parents three years ago. With his family, Dell has watched other delicatessens in the neighbourhood shutter, falling victim to the same three issues that have doomed most delis the world over.

The first is economic  running a deli is laughably expensive. For the most part, delis depend on one ingredient, beef  corned or pastramid, put in a hot dog or, in the case of tongue, pickled. When the price of beef goes up, other restaurants can change around their menus, push salads or appetizers, but no one is going to line up around the block at a deli for a cup of chicken soup or a plate of latkes.

The second reason so many delis close is cultural. The deli is a mirror of the American Jewish immigrant experience, and that experience has changed.

Youre not going to be cutting meat for the rest of your life. Im telling you my son, youre going to go be a doctor, youre going to be a lawyer, said Dell, imitating a Jewish grandfather. Maybe its not the first generation, maybe its not the second, but after a while, you start to see delis disappear because theres no one left to take over.

The third reason is changing trends. Todays dining landscape is health-conscious and vegetable-forward. Delis serve fatty meat and lots of it. Vegetable options at a traditional deli are mostly limited to fried potatoes and pickles, and purists wouldnt have it any other way.

According to David Sax who wrote Save the Deli: In Search of Perfect Pastrami, Crusty Rye, and the Heart of Jewish Delicatessen, 1930s New York was home to three or four thousand delis. Today, there are less than two dozen.

With that in mind, Dells responsibility to Katzs is weighty and two-fold: preserve the deli tradition in the face of a changing world, and heed the writing on the wall. In other words, innovate or die.

In a way, Dell is the perfect man for the job. He is steeped in the old ways, but also a young, modern entrepreneur. Where his parents got their business experience behind the meat counter, Dell went to New York Universitys Stern School of Business and got his MBA.

Alongside expanding the restaurants popular catering service, revamping its website and modernizing its shipping, for the first time in Katzs history, Dell is breaking ground on a new location, a takeout-only restaurant in downtown Brooklyn.

However, Dell is the first to admit that a successful Katzs delicatessen alone will not save the deli in New York City. For that, the deli has to come into the 21st Century and meet the needs of a new modern clientele. It needs people like Noah Bernamoff and his wife, Rae.

The Bernamoffs  and their partner Max Levine  opened the Mile End Deli six years ago. Instead of Manhattans Lower East Side, they put it in the hipster enclave of Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. Our goal was to create a deli that reflected our current values, Bernamoff said, not necessarily the values of our parents.

They started by looking back to the delis 19th Century beginnings. The archetypal American deli  with cafeteria lighting and old men angrily returning soup  is an invention of the 1950s. The deli that interested Bernamoff was the deli of the first few generations of immigrants that arrived here, bringing the focus back on the product. His pastrami is dry cured, not wet brined  and is steamed and cut thick and by hand, not portioned and boiled  like many other places. The result is a thick slice of boldly beefy, well-spiced and almost botanical pastrami that crumbles in your mouth but holds up when piled high on rye.

All these steps are traditional and in line with extra-traditional deli, he explained. What I often say, is it goes back beyond the deli we now consider to be old school deli.

While the product may be old school through and through, Bernamoff is fully aware of the new generation of younger, plugged-in, food-obsessed consumers. He carefully sources all of his products, using all-natural Black Angus beef without antibiotics or hormones. Mile End is bright and airy with reggae coming through the speakers, and the menu has a few modern crowd pleasers like a warm vegetable salad with yogurt and mint, and Montreal-inspired smoked meat poutine.

If the Bernamoffs are looking back, then Will Horowitz is looking way, way back. While Bernamoff harkens back to the original American delis, Horowitz is interested in the age-old techniques from Eastern Europe that underpinned them. Horowitz, who  with his sister Julie  opened Harry & Idas in 2015 in the East Village, is delicatessens mad scientist. In its small kitchen and cellar, there are ribs in the smoker, venison dry-aging in a closet, rows of pickling barrels, trays of salted fish, jars of tiny oysters in oil and an aquarium of eels.

If you look at the past 80 years, we have this tradition, but what about the last 150 years or 200 years? he said. What is traditional pastrami? The original pastrami in Southern Romania or Hungary was probably more cured and smoked goose breast than it was beef.

Horowitz may depend on ancient techniques but what he makes is boldly, radically modern. Pastrami at Harry & Idas isnt served on rye bread but on a sandwich roll. The aromatic, old-world tang of the sandwich comes instead from caraway seeds and rye berries in an accompanying buttermilk slaw. The mustard  A. Bauer's Mustard  is as traditional as it gets, but they take it on a trip through Spain, hitting it with preserved Meyer lemon and brined white anchovies.

The pastrami itself is cut the thickest of all, and spends more time in the smoker than most, a nod to Horowitzs love of Texas barbeque. Finally, the sandwich is finished with a handful of fresh dill, an old-country ingredient but a flourish he picked up from South East Asia.

The sandwich is wholly new, but in its way is absolutely true to the soul of delicatessen: a reflection of the Jewish immigrant experience. Now in the fourth or fifth generation, that experience is sophisticated, global, aware of the past and alive with possibilities.",[]

As pessoas que mantem diarios sabem ha muito tempo que traduzir seus sentimentos em palavras pode ajudar a acalmar suas emocoes e coloca-las em perspectiva, mas foi so recentemente que os cientistas perceberam a forca que essa acao tao simples pode ter.

Em suma: passar 15 minutos por dia escrevendo um diario pode reduzir os sintomas de depressao e ansiedade, reforcar o sistema imunologico e melhorar seu desempenho no trabalho.

Os beneficios podem durar meses. E muito mais efetivo do que deixar suas frustracoes se acumularem. Alem disso, manifestar sua raiva de forma agressiva somente te deixa mais bravo.

Pode soar meio brega, mas funciona: as pessoas que fazem um esforco consciente para praticar cinco pequenos atos de bondade, por apenas um dia por semana, relatam um nivel de satisfacao com a vida maior apos seis semanas de experiencia.

Isso e parte de um volume cada vez maior de pesquisas que indicam que as pessoas mais generosas sao mais felizes e saudaveis.

Imagine sua vida sem uma amizade proxima ou um companheiro ou companheira. E dificil, nao?

Mas uma pesquisa de 2009 descobriu que as pessoas que conseguiam fazer essa especie de abstracao mental acabavam tendo uma melhoria de humor posterior.

Talvez com isso elas deixassem de pensar em suas pessoas mais amadas como naturalmente proximas e, assim, cuidassem mais de suas relacoes com elas. Pilhas de estudos ja mostraram que dizer obrigado regularmente e sentir gratidao melhora a satisfacao com a vida.

Psicologos comecaram a entender a importancia de ter um sentido na vida  as pessoas que veem um proposito em sua existencia tendem a ser mais mentalmente resistentes a obstaculos de curto prazo.

Pesquisas sugerem que simplesmente olhar fotos antigas e uma maneira de lembrar das coisas que fazem sua vida ter sentido  estar com familiares ou amigos, fazer caridade ou alcancar sucesso profissional, por exemplo.

Remexer memorias antigas pode te conectar com o passado e ajudar a colocar eventos mais recentes em uma perspectiva mais ampla, o que tambem pode reduzir o impacto de novas decepcoes ou da ansiedade.

E facil ficar envolvido nas preocupacoes do dia a dia. E por isso que os cientistas estao cada vez mais interessados nos beneficios de se sentir positivamente impressionado.

Se e a vista impressionante de um ceu estrelado ou acompanhar uma missa alegre na igreja, sentir-se bem com algo que parece muito maior do que voce mesmo pode ajudar a abrir a mente.

Os cientistas descobriram que isso faz as pessoas mais felizes, mais altruistas, menos impacientes e menos ansiosas. Mesmo passar alguns minutos escrevendo sobre uma experiencia inspiradora pode ajudar.

Coisas que alguma vez ja nos deram prazer podem rapidamente perder intensidade ao longo do tempo, levando a uma especie de busca incessante pelo hedonismo.

Voce pode tentar redescobrir aquela satisfacao inicial ao abdicar de uma fonte de alegria  como sua comida favorita ou uma bebida  por uma semana. Apos sete dias, vai descobrir que voltou a situacao inicial e pode tirar o maximo prazer daquilo outra vez.

Enquanto isso, a experiencia pode te levar a procurar outras fontes de entretenimento, que podem se tornar uma nova fonte de prazer em si mesmas.

Se a abstinencia por uma semana parece dificil demais, voce pode tentar o truque de entrar de cabeca em sua atividade favorita. Ao tomar um gole de cafe, por exemplo, concentre-se na complexidade dos sabores passeando pelas suas papilas gustativas. Os estudos ja mostraram que isso pode te ajudar a apreciar os pequenos prazeres da vida, reduzindo o estresse e a ansiedade.

O proverbio italiano La lingua batte dove il dente duole  a lingua bate onde doi o dente  descreve perfeitamente a tendencia da nossa mente em remoer as dores do passado.

Isso nao apenas provoca ansiedade e tristeza, mas tambem pode gerar um sentimento de desespero que pode nos deixar mais suscetiveis a tentacao no futuro. Por essa razao, passar alguns minutos tentando cultivar sentimentos positivos em relacao a voce mesmo pode melhorar sua sensacao de satisfacao e sua forca de vontade.

Mas, enquanto seus pais e irmao comemoram a investida da Policia Federal, Vitor afirma que a acao foi abusiva. Esse e o estopim para o inicio de mais uma acalorada discussao politica.

As discussoes entre os quatro membros da familia Chiarello, de Sao Paulo, dao uma ideia da polarizacao que o Brasil enfrenta desde as ultimas eleicoes - e que esquentou com a investigacao do ex-presidente Lula pela Operacao Lava Jato.

Na casa de Vitor, ele e o unico defensor de politicas de esquerda. O jovem, bolsista do ProUni, cita programas sociais implantados no governo Lula como parte dos argumentos para defender o ex-presidente. Mas recebe contra-ataques de todos os lados.

""E muito claro que o Lula e uma pessoa egocentrica, narcisista, que trabalha apenas por ele mesmo"", diz a mae dele Marly Alzira, 58. ""O ProUni que o Vitor recebeu e apenas o retorno de parte dos impostos que nos mesmos pagamos"", completa o pai Oswaldo Gabriel, 58.

O professor e pesquisador do nucleo de pesquisas em politicas publicas da USP (Universidade de Sao Paulo) Leandro Piquet Carneiro afirma que o cenario vivido pela familia Chiarello e reflexo de uma intensa e inedita polarizacao da politica brasileira.

""E a primeira vez que um governo de esquerda, que ainda nao tinha alcancado o poder e contava com um apoio muito forte de setores escolarizados e populares, se ve numa situacao de desconforto no pais. Agora, vemos o apoio publico e manifestacoes favoraveis a esses governos sob ataque, ate mesmo em debates em familia"", afirmou.

Para Carneiro, porem, a discussao politica ainda e moderada no Brasil, quando comparado a seus vizinhos. ""Por mais animado que esteja o debate, estamos muito moderados se comparado a Argentina, Venezuela e Chile, por exemplo"", afirmou.

O pesquisador compara a situacao de divisao ideologica no pais com a dos EUA e avalia que a internet e o amplo acesso a informacao ajudaram a acirrar esses debates. Por outro lado, ele ve as redes sociais como uma ferramenta prejudicial a discussao politica no pais porque as pessoas se isolam, se afastam do mundo real e evitam o acesso a opinioes divergentes.

""As redes sociais nao correspondem a sua expectativa inicial porque elas criam um processo de encapsulamento. Voce se liga ao seu circuito e rede de contatos e isso vai definindo o que voce recebe de informacao. Junte a isso o fato de as pessoas lerem cada vez menos jornal e dependerem cada vez menos de jornalistas profissionais que moderam esses assuntos de forma equilibrada"", afirma.

Lula governou o pais de 2002 a 2010, sendo sucedido por Dilma Rousseff na Presidencia. A ultima pesquisa de opiniao do Instituto Datafolha, feita em fevereiro, aponta que Lula teria 20% dos votos dos eleitores brasileiros caso fosse candidato a Presidencia, atras apenas do senador Aecio Neves (PSDB), que tem a preferencia de 24% da populacao.

Cercado

O ator Guilherme Carrasco Neto, 27, tambem vive um quadro explosivo quando discute os rumos politicos do pais com sua familia. O jovem, que ve as acoes contra o ex-presidente Lula como uma ""encenacao para criar a imagem de um bandido"", e bombardeado por argumentos contrarios de seus parentes.

A mae dele faz duras criticas contra o governo, enquanto o pai tenta fazer o meio de campo nos debates ao mesmo tempo em que tenta acalmar os animos de ambos os lados.

Mas Neto se sente ainda mais encurralado quando seu irmao e a cunhada visitam sua casa no fim de semana. ""Meu irmao e filiado a um partido neoliberal e e contra as politicas do PT. Eu nao sou petista, mas considero os avancos sociais trazidos por esse governo"", afirma.

E quando o assunto e Dilma ou Lula, o tom de voz aumenta e os debates terminam de forma parecida: todos com a cara fechada. ""Sao posicoes que nao batem com a minha. Eu nao consigo aceitar a deles e eles nao me compreendem"", conta Neto.

Image copyright Fabio Tanaka Image caption Mae e filho se divertem apos discussao politica

Neto diz que acha incoerente sua cunhada ter sido ""beneficiada pelo governo Lula"" e rejeitar o ex-presidente. ""Ela e formada em economia pela Pontificia Universidade Catolica de Sao Paulo (PUC-SP) com bolsa do ProUni, e negra e morava na periferia da cidade"", afirmou.

Neto disse que nunca usou isso como um argumento durante as discussoes para evitar um possivel ""climao"" familiar, mas tem vontade.

O debate mais acalorado, porem, ocorreu em janeiro deste ano, quando Neto defendeu as manifestacoes promovidas pelo MPL (Movimento Passe Livre), que pede a isencao das tarifas de onibus, metro e trem.

""Eu queria mostrar como esses jovens se organizam e que eles nao sao baderneiros aliados aos black blocs, como mostra a imprensa. Nesse dia, ainda estavam alguns tios meus que tambem ajudaram a criticar o Passe Livre com opinioes acaloradas"", contou Neto.

O irmao dele, Daniel Carrasco Neto, 35, afirmou que Guilherme tem uma ""visao romantica da politica"" porque ainda e muito novo.

""Ele acha que o mercado e o capitalismo sao uma coisa ruim e pensa que os empresarios devem ser controlados. A gente tenta ensinar que, se voce nao consegue ganhar dinheiro, nao produz. Dar dinheiro para as pessoas nao vai estimular ninguem a evoluir"", afirma.

Para Daniel, a saida para a atual crise politico-financeira passa pelo impeachment da presidente Dilma Rousseff. ""Esse governo e um fracasso total. Ja esperavamos que seria ruim, mas nem tanto. Os escandalos de corrupcao aliados a incapacidade dela de fazer politica esta afundando o pais"", afirma.

Na visao dele, o sucesso do presidente Lula se deve a estabilidade financeira e a alta do preco das commodities quando ele assumiu o pais. ""Ele so distribuiu o dinheiro extra que estava entrando. Ele e um safado porque formou a imagem dele em cima desse marketing e quis comprar o apoio de todos os partidos, o que deu origem ao Mensalao e Petrolao"", diz.

Daniel afirmou que vai participar dos protesto marcado para o proximo domingo (13) na avenida Paulista para pedir o impeachment de Dilma Rousseff.",[]

Mr Trump has won seven states so far for the Republicans. His rival Ted Cruz won two. Marco Rubio got just one. In the Democratic Party race Hillary Clinton is projected to have won in seven states  including the major prize of Texas. Her only rival Bernie Sanders has won in four.

The threat of the Zika virus reaching the US has come a step closer. Scientists are warning that hundreds of thousands of people in the American territory of Puerto Rico could become infected in the coming months and possibly spread Zika to the US itself.

A Nasa astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut are back on Earth after spending nearly a year on board the International Space Station. Their research will help plan a future manned mission to Mars.

Donald Trump e Hillary Clinton dominaram as primarias da Superterca nos EUA - ambos sao agora os favoritos para vencer as nominacoes de seus partidos para a eleicao presidencial de novembro. Entre os Republicanos, Trump ganhou em sete Estados. Seu rival Ted Cruz em dois. Marco Rubio em apenas um. No Partido Democrata, Hillary Clinton ganhou em sete Estados - incluindo o cobicado Texas. Seu unico rival, Bernie Sanders, ganhou em quatro.

A ameaca de o virus Zika chegar aos EUA avancou mais um passo. Cientistas estao alertando que centenas de milhares de pessoas no territorio americano de Porto Rico podem ser infectadas nos proximos meses e possivelmente espalhar zika pelos EUA.

Um astronauta da Nasa e um cosmonauta russo estao de volta a Terra depois de passar quase um ano na Estacao Espacial Internacional. Sua pesquisa ajudara a planejar uma futura missao tripuladas a Marte.

O astronauta americano Scott Kelly, que retornou do espaco na semana passada depois de passar quase um ano na Estacao Espacial Internacional (EEI), diz sentir fortes dores pelo corpo.

Sente tanta dor nos musculos e articulacoes que mal consegue dizer onde doi.

""Estou surpreendido pela diferenca entre como me sinto agora, fisicamente, em comparacao com a primeira missao em que estive"", diz em entrevista poucos dias apos voltar a Terra.

Kelly passou quase um ano na Estacao Espacial Internacional com o cosmonauta russo Mikhail Kornienko.

Na outra missao, Kelly ficou no espaco por 159 dias.

Ele ja sabia que sentiria dores musculares e fadiga.

""Desta vez, assim que sai da capsula (no Cazaquistao) me senti melhor do que na primeira vez"", disse.

Mas, apos uma pausa, contou que em algum momento comecou a sentir um nivel de dor muscular ""muito maior do que da outra vez"".

Image copyright Getty Image caption Scott foi acompanhado por cosmonauta russo nos 340 dias no espaco

E algo que nao havia ocorrido antes: agora, ele sente hipersensibilidade na pele. Segundo Scott, isso ocorre porque a pele nao encostou em nada significativo por muito tempo.

""E um sensacao de ardencia sempre que sento, deito ou ando"", contou.

Diferenca de altura

E a primeira vez que um americano passa tanto tempo na microgravidade.

Os russos levam vantagem: nos anos 1990, Valery Polyakov passou 438 dias na estacao espacial MIR.

Mas o que torna a viagem de Kelly particularmente interessante nao sao apenas os 340 dias que ele passou na EEI ou as 5.440 voltas que deu ao redor de nosso planeta, mas o fato de seu irmao gemeo, Mark Kelly, ter ficado na Terra para que fosse estudado o impacto psicologico e fisiologico de uma viagem longa no espaco sobre o corpo humano.

Uma das primeiras mudancas visiveis foi que havia superado seu irmao em altura - tinha 3,81 cm a mais que ele.

""A gravidade se encarregou de coloca-lo no lugar dele"", brincou.

Mas poucos dias depois de voltar a Terra - e a forca da gravidade -, Scott ja tinha voltado ao tamanho normal.

Entender estas mudancas e importante para os especialistas. Os astronautas que voltaram da estacao espacial foram recebidos por uma comitiva mas, em um eventual futura missao a Marte, terao que se adaptar sozinhos a chegada a um planeta com uma gravidade diferente da Terra.

Image copyright AP Image caption Eles sao gemeos identicos, mas Scott tem 3,8 cm a mais agora

Os irmaos Kelly foram submetidos - antes e durante a missao - a uma bateria de exames psicologicos e fisiologicos.

Eles devem continuar sendo ""ratos de laboratorio"" por dois anos.

Apos o pouso no Cazaquistao, ele foi levado a Noruega para os primeiros exames fisicos e seguiu para os EUA. Ele contou que nesse trajeto nao conseguiu dormir, por estar ""incomodado e com muita dor muscular.""

A chegar aos Estados Unidos, foi submetido a mais exames fisicos e analises sanguineas, assim como scanner cerebral.

Ma pontaria

Image copyright AP Image caption Ao aterrizar, astronautas tiveram ajuda, o que nao acontecera em Marte

O astronauta explica que, entre outras dificuldades, esta tendo problemas com pontaria na hora de jogar objetos.

""Fracassei com a primeira coisa que tentei jogar em uma mesa; tentei jogar basquete e nao fiz cesta nenhuma vez... mas eu ja nao era um bom jogador.""

Quando astronautas voltam a Terra eles tem tendencia a soltar as coisas, como quando estao sem gravidade.

Sobre o mal-estar fisico, ha varias explicacoes.

Quando estao em microgravidade, os astronautas perdem massa muscular e densidade ossea, apesar das duas horas de exercicios seis dias por semana.

Image caption Efeitos da viagem devem ser totalmente conhecidos em seis anos

Mesmo assim, como nao precisam aguentar a gravidade, os musculos ficam mais preguicosos.

O coracao continua bombeando a mesma quantidade de sangue para as extremidades, mas os vasos sanguineos das pernas nao tem que trabalhar tanto para bombear sangue de volta para o coracao.

No espaco, os astronautas perdem volume de sangue, razao pela qual Scott recebeu uma transfusao de sangue apos o retorno.

Outro problema que os astronautas experimentam e uma inflamacao na parte posterior do olho enquanto estao no espaco. Isso causa problemas de visao que podem durar um tempo apos o retorno a gravidade.

Estas sao so algumas das mudancas que aconteceram no corpo de Scott e, muito provavelmente, em seu companheiro russo.

Mas so saberemos o verdadeiro impacto da viagem em seis anos, quando os cientistas preveem que os resultados da pesquisa serao publicados.",[]

bbc.com,,Whatever happened to the obesity strategy?,"['Health Editor', 'Hugh Pym']","Image copyright Thinkstock

The Prime Minister's battle against Brexit and the launch of the childhood obesity strategy would not at first glance appear to have much in common.

But the former, in the shape of the dramatic events which have played out since last week, is highly relevant to the progress of the latter. The key thing to remember is that David Cameron is involved in both.

The Government strategy on childhood obesity in England has been much talked about since last summer.

There was talk of a launch before Christmas, then early in the New Year, then in February. But still it has not appeared.

There is speculation now that it may not be published before Easter. The simple reason is the prime minister's overcrowded diary and his current preoccupation with Europe.

David Cameron knows the clock is ticking down to the end of his premiership before the next election.

He wants to make his mark on domestic policy and he has identified tackling obesity as an important potential part of his legacy.

It is seen at Number Ten as a priority second term issue, to rank with the dementia initiative in his first term of office. Much of the groundwork has already been done by the Department of Health and Public Health England.

Image copyright Thinkstock

The trouble is Mr Cameron just does not seem to have time to think about the obesity question, let alone put the finishing touches to a strategy which is seen in Whitehall as potentially the most ambitious of its kind in the world.

Europe and the drive to win a referendum dominate the prime minister's every waking hour. He told the House of Commons he would be making the case for staying in the EU ""every day for the next four months"".

The question now is when he can find a slot in his diary to unveil a policy which has been long awaited by the NHS and the food and drink industry.

The first question to address is whether a sugar tax should form part of the childhood obesity strategy.

Unpopular tax

A sugar tax is on the table having, last autumn, been left firmly on the shelf.

Mr Cameron has come round to the idea that such a move might be electorally popular, not least with Jamie Oliver and those of like mind.

Reports that a sugar tax will feature in the strategy have not been denied, although it's likely to be there in the form of a threat to the food and drink industry if other measures do not work.

The Prime Minister will also have to decide whether regulation is required for reducing sugar content of food and drink and restricting product promotions in supermarkets.

Public Health England's document on sugar reduction, published in October 2015, described how food price promotions are more widespread in the UK than anywhere else in Europe and how high-sugar products are promoted more than others.

The strategy seems likely to contain measures to limit sales of confectionery at checkouts and in prominent positions in supermarket aisles.

Restricting ""buy one, get one free"" offers for high-sugar or high-calorie food and drink products is another probable avenue.

Mr Cameron's anti-red tape and pro-business leanings might steer him away from such an approach and towards a voluntary deal agreed with the supermarkets. But officials and experts will make the case for government intervention.

You might imagine that leading retailers would throw their hands up in horror at the prospect of the government limiting their freedom to promote products as they see fit.

But perhaps surprisingly, the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which represents big names on the high street, has supported the idea of regulation.

The BRC argues that a voluntary deal won't work as some shops will fail to go along with it.

Better, the organisation argues, for everyone to be obliged to fall into line with new regulations.

Decisions are still needed from the prime minister. Much of the strategy is written.

Health officials are anxious to get it launched with measures put in place to start tackling the obesity threat to the nation's health.

But it remains off the menu in Downing Street, at least until Mr Cameron tires of his European diet.",[]
bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,Cientistas encontram pistas para explicar extincao de 'dragoes do mar',['Helen Briggs'],"Image copyright Andrey Atuchin Image caption Cientistas afirmam que o ictiossauro evoluiu muito lentamente e, quando o ambiente mudou, ele nao conseguiu acompanhar

Um novo estudo de cientistas britanicos, belgas, franceses e russos sugere que uma mudanca dramatica no clima da Terra foi responsavel pela extincao de um reptil marinho que viveu na epoca dos dinossauros.

Ha cerca de 100 milhoes de anos os oceanos esquentaram, o gelo polar derreteu e o nivel dos mares aumentou de forma inedita.

Segundo os cientistas o ictiossauro, tambem conhecido como ""peixe lagarto"" ou ""dragao dos mares"", nao conseguiu se adaptar as novas condicoes nos mares.

A pesquisa adiciona um ultimo dado surpreendente para desvendar o misterio de como e por que este predador desapareceu.

""Nossos resultados fortalecem as evidencias de que o aumento no nivel dos mares e na temperatura dos mares reorganizou profundamente os ecossistemas marinhos ha cerca de 100 milhoes de anos"", disse Valentin Fischer, da Universidade de Liege, na Belgica, e tambem da Universidade de Oxford, que liderou a pesquisa.

""O ictiossauro nao conseguiu se adaptar. Eles evoluiram muito lentamente nos ultimos 50 milhoes de anos de sua existencia. Quando o ambiente mudou rapidamente, eles nao conseguiram acompanhar"", acrescentou.

Familia

Na epoca em que os dinossauros viviam na Terra, os oceanos eram o lar de varios tipos de ictiossauro.

Estes predadores marinhos tinham um corpo parecido com o do golfinho, o que dava ao ictiossauro velocidade e permitia que ele se alimentasse de peixes e lulas.

O ictiossauro viveu durante milhoes de anos. Eles apareceram no periodo Triassico, chegaram ao auge no Jurassico e entao desapareceram no Cretaceo, varios milhoes de anos antes da morte dos ultimos dinossauros.

Teorias anteriores sobre o desaparecimento do ictiossauro se concentraram mais nos alimentos preferidos da criatura, que podem ter desaparecido dos oceanos a medida que outros animais, como tubaroes e outros peixes vertebrados, comecaram a surgir.

Mas depois de elaborar uma arvore genealogica complexa tracando a evolucao dos ictiossauros, os cientistas desta ultima pesquisa concluiram que a falta de alimento teria sido apenas um entre varios fatores ligados a extincao do animal.

""Embora o aumento nas temperaturas e no nivel dos mares demonstrado em registros geologicos no mundo todo pode nao ter afetado diretamente os ictiossauros, fatores relacionados como mudancas na disponibilidade de comida, rotas migratorias, animais rivais e locais de nascimento sao fatores potenciais, provavelmente ocorrendo juntos, que levaram a extincao do ictiossauro"", disse Fischer.

Efeito estufa

David Martill, pesquisador da Universidade de Portsmouth, na Gra-Bretanha, nao participou do estudo, mas ao analisar a pesquisa disse concordar que a mudanca para um mundo mais quente - como uma ""superestufa"" - pode ter tido um impacto enorme nos habitats de animais terrestres e aquaticos.

O ictiossauro dividia os oceanos com outros grupos numerosos de repteis marinhos de grande porte como plesiossauro e mosassauro. Mas o ictiossauro conseguiu viver mais tempo do que estes dois ultimos.

""Eles (os ictiossauros) so desapareceram junto com muitos outros animais. Ha um misterio nisto. Acho que ainda e um enigma"", afirmou Martill a BBC.

A famosa cacadora britanica de fosseis do seculo 19 Mary Anning descobriu o primeiro fossil completo do ictiossauro na regiao de Dorset em 1810.

A descoberta de Anning causolu grande surpresa no mundo cientifico da epoca e forneceu provas para novas ideias a respeito da historia da Terra.",[]

bbc.com,,Brazil's continuing corruption problem,"['Donna Bowater', 'Rio De Janeiro']","Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Petrobras has seen a sharp fall from grace

When Petrobras was named the most ethical global oil and gas company in 2008, few would have imagined that the company would now find itself at the centre of the biggest corruption investigation in Brazilian history.

But a criminal probe is indeed continuing into alleged corruption at Brazil's largest business.

A number of directors at state-run Petrobras are accused of taking bribes from construction companies, in return for awarding them lucrative contracts.

Public prosecutors and federal police claim that bribes of up to 5% of contract values were being skimmed off.

And it is further alleged that some of these funds were funnelled to officials in the ruling coalition of the Workers' Party and Brazilian Democratic Movement Party.

In the wake of the continuing investigation, the federal prosecutor's office has launched a three-month, economy-wide anti-corruption campaign, including increased punishments for those found guilty, and improvements to the recovery of the proceeds of crime.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Brazilians have taken to the streets this year to protest against corruption in the country

But as the Petrobras scandal continues to dominate the headlines in Brazil, how much of a corruption problem does the country have?

'Preach and act'

The Petrobras investigation, named Operation Lava Jato (or Car Wash in English), may be the biggest corruption probe in Brazil's history, but it is far from the first.

Instead for many commentators, corruption is endemic and institutionalised in Brazil.

Take the case of former billionaire Eike Batista, once the richest man in the country.

He fell from grace last year after his energy, mining and shipbuilding empire collapsed, and he was charged with insider trading and market manipulation, charges he denies.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Last summer's World Cup in Brazil is also being investigated by anti-corruption officials

Standing trial this year, the case was suspended back in February after the presiding judge - who had ordered the seizure of 1.5bn reals ($388m; 252m) of the businessman's assets - was found to be driving one of Mr Batista's luxury cars.

Separately, Mr Batista, 58, who was once worth as much as $30bn (20bn), was fined 1.4m Brazilian reals in March by regulators for failing to alert investors about the imminent takeover of his EBX Group.

Meanwhile, both Brazilian investigators, and the US's FBI, are continuing to investigate allegations of corruption at last year's World Cup in Brazil.

""Unfortunately, despite the importance and the recurrence of the subject, ethics is not yet in fact valued by a large number of companies operating in Brazil,"" says Douglas Linhares Flinto, founder and president of the Brazilian Institute of Business Ethics.

A non-profit pressure group, it was set up back in 2003.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption State-owned Petrobras is Brazil's largest company

Mr Flinto adds: ""Many businesses can talk about ethics, and even highlight it in the list of the company's values hung on the wall and emphasized on the website.

""However, corporate actions prove that ethics is not a value to be pursued and used on a daily basis.

""And this is the biggest problem of the business world - the inconsistency in which many companies preach and act.""

'Mitigate risk'

One of the factors behind prevalent corruption in Brazil is the high level of bureaucracy in the country, according to Transparency International, the global organisation that monitors the problem.

It says that companies in Brazil face a number of regulatory hurdles to do business, which opens up opportunities for bribery.

Separately, a 2009 survey by the World Bank Group found that almost 70% of Brazilian business owners and managers said corruption was a major obstacle.

Yet despite such findings, the Brazilian government says it is working hard to tackle the issue.

It points to a new Anti-Corruption Law that came into force last year, and highlights the continuing investigations into Petrobras and Mr Batista as a sign of the renewed efforts.

Inspired by the new law, a think tank called the Brazil Compliance Institute was set up last December by lawyer Sylvia Urquiza.

It aims to promote best practice and help companies meet their duties under the new regulations, and has been backed by the International Business School of Sao Paulo and Candido Mendes University.

Google's compliance director, Camila von Ancken, and Ana Leao, compliance manager at global drinks giant Diageo are among the experts who have worked with the institute.

Mrs Urquiza says: ""Managers' accountability for irregularities committed in the name of the company, attitudes that can mitigate punishment, suggestions of good practices... are some of the points that the institute clarifies.

""[We do this] through workshops, lectures and meetings.""

Petrobras has also increased efforts to prevent misconduct, and late last year issued a new code of conduct.

It has also developed ethics courses for staff, as well as introducing more stringent controls on the management of suppliers.

A Petrobras spokeswoman says: ""[Supplier] companies must provide detailed information on structure, finance and compliance mechanisms and combating fraud and corruption, among other things, being evaluated by the process known as Due Diligence of Integrity.

""The aim is to increase safety on the procurement of goods and services and mitigate risks related to fraud and corrupt practices.""

Back at the Brazilian Institute of Business Ethics, Mr Flinto says that despite the recent controversies, he is hopeful that the country may now be changing for the better, and that the recent high profile scandals will lead to better standards in the future.

""All this is turning a page in the history of my country and, more than that, it will be a milestone in the improvement of ethical standards of government and companies, and an entire society that can, in a short time, reach the strict standards of more developed nations,"" he says.

""I am convinced that ethics is coming to Brazil to stay. Brazil will never be the same.""",[]

Cada dia, como ha ocurrido durante miles de millones de anos, el Sol se eleva por el horizonte de la Tierra.

Puede estar a 150 millones de kilometros de distancia, pero nuestra estrella brilla tan fuerte en el cielo que ni siquiera podemos mirarla con nuestros propios ojos sin danarlos.

En la superficie, el Sol tiene una temperatura de 5.500o C, lo cual podria hacer derretir por completo cualquier sonda de aterrizaje incluso antes de que llegara a acercarse.

Es, literalmente, demasiado caliente para manipularlo. Pero eso no significa que no podamos estudiarlo.

De hecho, hay varias tecnicas gracias a las cuales comenzamos a desentranar los secretos de las estrellas repartidas por el cielo nocturno, asi como los del astro de nuestro propio patio trasero. Como es esto posible?

Dispersando la luz

En 1802, un cientifico ingles llamado William Hyde Wollaston separo con un prisma la luz solar y observo algo inesperado: lineas oscuras en el espectro.

Unos anos mas tarde, el optico aleman Joseph von Fraunhofer construyo un instrumento especial, el espectrometro, para dispersar la luz mejor, y vio que existian mas de estas curiosas lineas oscuras.

Image copyright Kamioka Observatory Image caption El Super-Kamiokande investiga el Sol, pero lo hace bajo tierra.

Los cientificos pronto se dieron cuenta de que las lineas oscuras mostraban donde faltaban colores del espectro, pues habia elementos dentro y alrededor del Sol que estaban absorbiendo esas ondas de luz especificas.

Por tanto, esas lineas oscuras indicaban la presencia de ciertos elementos como hidrogeno, sodio y calcio.

Era un descubrimiento inteligente, bello y sencillo, y nos mostro algunos elementos clave de nuestra estrella mas cercana.

Sin embargo, tal y como apunta el fisico Philipp Podsiadlowski, este enfoque tiene sus limitaciones.

""Solo nos habla de la composicion del Sol en la superficie, no explica nada sobre la composicion de su interior"", dice.

Entonces, que hay dentro de el Sol? Y como adquirio su colosal energia?

Bajo tierra

A principios del siglo XX surgio la teoria de que si los atomos de hidrogeno se fusionaran podrian crear un elemento completamente diferente helio- y liberar energia durante el proceso.

El Sol era, por lo tanto, rico en hidrogeno y helio, y debia su gran poder a la formacion de este ultimo a partir del primero. Pero la idea todavia tenia que probarse.

""En 1930 se descubrio que la energia del Sol se debia a esa fusion, pero eso era tan solo la teoria"", explica Podsiadlowski.

Para poder saber mas sobre la estrella que dio vida a nuestro mundo, era necesario sumergirse debajo de la Tierra.

De hecho, tuvimos que enterrar nuestros experimentos bajo las montanas. Asi fue como se diseno el detector japones Super-Kamiokande (Super-K).

Image copyright SPL Image caption Cada elemento tiene un espectro de absorcion unico.

Unos 1.000 metros por debajo de la superficie, se encuentra una lugubre sala de aspecto extrano.

Contiene un lago poco profundo de agua pura y 13.000 objetos esfericos cubren las pareces, el techo y el suelo bajo el agua.

Parece de ciencia ficcion, pero el Super-K esta destinado a entender mejor como funciona el Sol.

Estando tan dentro de la Tierra, es obvio que el Super-K no esta construido para detectar la luz. En cambio, espera que se creen unas particulas muy especiales en el centro de nuestra estrella y volar a traves de la materia como un avion vuela en el aire.

Hay muchos trillones de ellas pasando cada segundo. Y si no fuera por los detectores especiales, nunca hubieramos sabido que estan ahi.

Pero el Super-K puede revelar algunas de ellas, unas 40 al dia, gracias a su detector de luz especial que fue creado cuando estas particulas, llamadas neutrinos, interactuan con su lago de agua pura.

La luz que se crea es muy debil, pero genera una suerte de halo que puede ser recogida por sus increiblemente sensibles detectores de luz.

Image copyright SPL Image caption La fusion de atomos dentro de las estrellas explica la formacion de los neutrinos.

Algunos tipos especiales de neutrinos identificados con este metodo son considerados una prueba evidente de la fusion nuclear del hidrogeno en helio que ocurre dentro del Sol.

Y no conocemos otra explicacion a la formacion de los neutrinos.

Estudiarlos nos permite observar lo que sucede dentro del Sol casi en tiempo real.

Manchas solares

Es facil tener la impresion de que el Sol es un elemento permanente. Pero las estrellas tienen ciclos y esperanzas de vida, que varian segun su tamano y proporcion.

En la decada de 1980, investigadores que trabajaban en la Solar Maximum Mission, se dieron cuenta de que en el transcurso los ultimos 10 anos, la energia del Sol se ha desvanecido y despues recobrado fuerza de nuevo.

Era increible, ademas, el numero de manchas solares regiones del Sol con temperaturas mas bajas- relacionadas con esta actividad: cuantas mas habia, mas energia se liberaba.

""Esto es muy peculiar; cuantas mas manchas solares hay, mas elementos frios, mas caliente se vuelve el Sol"", dice Simon Foester, del Imperial College de Londres, Reino Unido.

Foster dice que los cientificos descubrieron el porque.

Hay zonas especialmente brillantes en la superficie solar -llamadas antorchas- que coinciden con las manchas solares pero que tienen ambos lados visibles, y son estas antorchas las que desprenden energia adicional.

Con rayos X y ondas de radio

Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption Hay manchas solares por todo el Sol.

Tambien es posible detectar erupciones solares: enormes destellos de materia que se forman de la acumulacion de energia magnetica del Sol.

Puesto que las estrellas emiten radiacion a traves del espectro electromagnetico, estas erupciones pueden ser vistas con detectores de rayos X.

Pero hay otras formas de detectarlas. Una de ella es a traves de las ondas de radio, otra forma de radiacion electromagnetica.

""El enorme radiotelescopio de Jodrell Bank, en Inglaterra, es el primero de este tipo en el mundo y puede detectar erupciones solares"", dice Tim OBrien, de la Universidad de Manchester, quien trabaja en el telescopio.

Cuando una estrella se comporta de forma ""normal"", sin mucha actividad, no emite muchas ondas de radio. Sin embargo, cuando nacen o mueren generan enormes emisiones.

""Lo que vemos son los elementos activos. Vemos las explosiones de las estrellas, ondas de choque, vientos estelares"", dice OBrien.

Los radiotelescopios tambien son utilizados por el cientifico irlandes Jocelyn Bell Burnell para descubrir pulsares, un tipo especial de estrella de neutrones.

Las estrellas de neutrones se forman despues de explosiones gigantescas en las cuales una estrella colapsa sobre si misma para volverse increiblemente densa.

Los pulsares son ejemplos de este tipo de estrellas, las cuales emiten una radiacion electromagnetica que puede ser detectada por radiotelescopios.

Es una senal muy irregular, que se emite cada pocos milisegundos y que hizo que, al principio, algunos investigadores se preguntaran si se trataba de formas de comunicacion de especies inteligentes de otra parte del Universo.

El destino del Sol

Gracias al descubrimiento de muchos mas pulsares, hoy en dia se acepta el hecho de que este pulso regular es causado por el giro de la estrella misma.

Image copyright SPL Image caption Destinado a convertirse en una estrella enana?

""Si miras hacia el cielo en esa linea de vision, puedes ver un destello regular del haz pasando, como si se tratara de un faro"", explica OBrien.

Algunas estrellas estan destinadas a ser pulsares.

Pero nuestro Sol no es una de ellas; es demasiado pequeno para estallar en una reaccion supernova al final de su vida.

Entonces, cual es su destino en miles de millones de anos?

Sabemos, de la observacion de otras estrellas de nuestra galaxia, que existe todo un abanico de posibilidades.

Pero, dado lo que conocemos sobre la masa de nuestro Sol y habiendolo comparado con otras estrellas, su futuro parece bastante claro: se expandira gradualmente hasta el final de su vida en otros 5.000 millones de anos, mas o menos- hasta convertirse en un gigante rojo.

Despues, tras una serie de explosiones, tan solo quedara el nucleo interno de carbono, que es tan grande como la Tierra.

Y este se enfriara lentamente por mas de un billon de anos.

Hay muchos misterios sobre el Sol, y muchos proyectos interesantes para ayudar a descubrirlos.

Un ejemplo es la mision Solar Probe Plus de la NASA, que llegara mas cerca del Sol que nunca antes en la historia para intentar averiguar como se producen los vientos solares y descubrir por que la corona del Sol (un aura de plasma alrededor de la estrella) es mas caliente que su superficie.

Por ahora, conocemos algunos de los misterios esenciales.

La cancion de cuna del siglo XIX ""brilla, brilla, pequena estrella"" dice: ""me pregunto como eres"". Es reconfortante saber que, 200 anos mas tarde, por fin tenemos una idea bastante buena al respecto.

Five men have been jailed for up to seven years for the 14m Hatton Garden safety deposit box jewellery raid.

Three ringleaders behind the heist in London's jewellery quarter during Easter 2015 each received seven years.

Two other men, Carl Wood and William Lincoln, were given six and seven years respectively.

The mastermind, Brian Reader, was too ill to attend after a second stroke and will be sentenced later.

Sentencing them, the judge said: ""The burglary at the heart of this case stands in a class of its own.""

Media caption Danny Jones led police to a cemetery where he had hidden some jewellery and money

The ringleaders jailed for seven years each for conspiracy to commit burglary after pleading guilty last year were:

John ""Kenny"" Collins, 75, of Bletsoe Walk, Islington, north London

Daniel Jones, 61, of Park Avenue, Enfield, north London

Terry Perkins, 67, of Heene Road, Enfield.

They each said ""thank-you"" to the judge as they sat down.

Wood, 59, of Elderbeck Close, Cheshunt, Hertfordshire, and Lincoln, 60, of Winkley Street, Bethnal Green, east London, were sentenced for the same offence and one count of and conspiracy to conceal, convert or transfer criminal property, after a trial.

'Audacious burglary'

Hugh Doyle, of Riverside Gardens, Enfield, received a suspended sentence after he was found guilty of concealing, converting or transferring criminal property between January 1 and May 19 last year.

Speaking outside Woolwich Crown Court, Doyle said he felt ""relief that it's nearly all over... And I just want to spend some time with my family now and I've got boilers to fit in north London.

""I've known Ken [John Collins] for quite a few years, and it's literally just sucked into, literally, just sucked into it. But it's just one of those things.""

The gang breached the vault at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit in central London over the Easter weekend last year, stealing items worth an estimated 14m ($20m).

Image copyright Met Police Image caption Police found a plastic bag containing wristwatches in a casserole dish at the home of John ""Kenny"" Collins

Judge Christopher Kinch QC said he did not know if it could be proved as had been claimed in court that it was the ""biggest burglary in English history"".

But he said: ""It is clear that the burglary at the heart of this case stands in a class of its own in the scale of the ambition, the detail of the planning, the level of preparation and the organisation of the team carrying it out, and in terms of the value of the property stolen.""

Image copyright Metropolitan Police Image caption The vault at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd was breached over the Easter weekend last year

Detective Superintendent Craig Turner, head of the Met's Flying Squad, described it as ""an audacious burglary in the heart of London's diamond district"".

He added: ""These men were career criminals who didn't give a moment's thought for the people they were stealing from.

""For many of the victims these safety deposit boxes represented their livelihood. They put their most valuable property into the vault to keep safe during the bank holiday weekend only to see it cruelly snatched away.""

Around a third of the property has been recovered and most of it returned to the owners, according to the Met.",[]

Donald Trump continued his march towards the Republican Party nomination in the US by taking three more primaries. And where there's a Trump win, there's a social media reaction.

This time it was #ifTrumpwins that gathered momentum, bringing hope and levity to the serious world of campaign politics.

Or, that was the intention when Comedy Central's Midnight programme incited its 500,000 followers to play with the hashtag.

Over 10,500 tweets mention both @midnight and #iftrumpwins, making up nearly 40% of the original tweets on the hashtag.

The trend peaked at 7,468 tweets in the hour 0500-0600GMT with the fearful perspective of Dubai-based EDM producer Shuja Rabbani a top tweet.

Two tweets from @PoliticsJim helped drive the trend, garnering more than 6,000 retweets between them. Both involved satirising Trump's campaign slogan of ""Make America Great Again"".

One involves a playful take on popular American painter and TV personality Bob Ross, whose PBS programme The Joy of Painting brought him worldwide fame in the 1980s and 1990s.

Another saw Jim subverting the slogan with cake, transforming it to ""Bake America Cake Again"" - a sentiment all Americans passionate about patisserie can get behind, regardless of politics.

Judging by the spread of branded wine, water and meat Trump brought to his post-victory press conference, no one is going to go hungry if he wins.

While we're on hunger... Well done to Doomsdavid for getting a topical twist into the #ifTrumpwins + Hunger Games formula.

And for those of you playing along who don't like cake or steak, there's Keem's very American offer in the event that we find ourselves writing ""President Trump""...

This is the latest example of the way in which digital media is now playing its part the Presidential race, following on from Super Tuesday's spike in searches for ""move to Canada"", which of course got another outing.

bbc.com,,What are the UK's top areas for running and cycling?,"['Paul Kerley', 'Bbc News Magazine']","Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

Whether on two legs or two wheels, data reveals which areas of Britain are the busiest for running and cycling. And also where the fastest, longest, hilliest and flattest journeys are made.

The blue veiny lines criss-crossing Glasgow in the image above show running routes. The thicker and brighter the line, the more popular the route.

Similarly, in the image below, a network of cycle routes cut their way across part of Lincolnshire.

The colourful visualisations, called heatmaps, are from Strava - which describes itself as a social network for athletes. The data comes from Strava's End of Year Insights, which includes nearly 11 million runs and over 23 million cycle rides made in the UK in 2015.

Glasgow, it turns out, was the place where runners were fastest on average - with a pace per run for both men and women combined of five minutes 17 seconds per km (8:30 per mile).

Lincolnshire, with its relatively flat landscape, recorded the fastest average cycle ride speed - at 24.4km (15.16 miles) per hour.

Scroll down to see other interesting snippets of data and the top 10 areas for both running and cycling.

On phones and tablets these images are best viewed on the BBC News App - where you can tap to zoom in closer.

Across the UK, men recorded an average pace of 5:17 per km (8:30 per mile), for their average running distance of 8.4km (5.22 miles).

Women recorded a pace of 6:13 per km (10 minutes per mile), over their average 7km (4.35 mile) runs.

Powys

This area of mid-Wales had three running milestones in 2015.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

It took top spot for hilliest average run - with an average elevation of 177m (581ft).

It also came top for longest average distance and longest average time on the move - at 9.8km (6.09 miles) and 67 minutes.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

North-east Lincolnshire

While Lincolnshire took flattest average cycle ride, it was North East Lincolnshire - the unitary authority based around Grimsby and Cleethorpes - which saw the flattest average runs, at just 11m (36ft) of elevation.

Belfast

Northern Ireland's most active region for running was Belfast - with the banks of the River Lagan, snaking south through the city, proving a popular route.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

1. Greater London

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

With its huge population pushing the capital to the top of the list, the River Thames towpath through London is a popular route - as are runs through Regent's Park and Hyde Park in the centre of the city.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

2. West Yorkshire

Here many running routes hug hillsides in the Pennines - and end up looking like contour lines.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

3. Greater Manchester

The main commuter routes into Manchester are popular - and there is plenty of traffic along the twisting River Mersey a few miles south of the city centre.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

4. Hampshire

Popular areas include the New Forest, along the coast between Southampton and Portsmouth and out into the countryside from Basingstoke.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

5. Surrey

A close up on Surrey reveals a delicate web of routes along the North Downs - from Guildford to Redhill.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

6. South Yorkshire

For women, it was 19.8km (12.3 miles) per hour.

Merthyr Tydfil

The county borough at the top of the South Wales valleys recorded the hilliest cycle rides - with an average elevation of 630m (2067ft) per journey.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

Cambridgeshire

Eastern England saw the flattest average ride - with Cambridgeshire recording 119m (390 ft) elevation per trip.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

Edinburgh

The Scottish capital was home to the shortest average ride - at 20.7km (12.86 miles).

While the length does not seem particularly short, the data includes both recreational rides and commutes.

Strava says the average commute distance across the UK is 15.9km (9.88 miles).

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

Pembrokeshire

In contrast, south-west Wales saw the longest rides - at 39.8km (24.7 miles) on average.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

1. Greater London

As with running, it's not that surprising that the UK capital came out on top - but the cycle maps for London show a strong network of commuter routes.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

That's especially the case on the main arteries through the centre of the city.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

2. West Yorkshire

There's an even spread across the county, but with Leeds beating Bradford in the number of rides.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

3. Greater Manchester

A strong show on the commuter routes from the south and west - but also a tangled mix of blue to the east of the city centre, in the parkland around the National Cycling Centre.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

4. Surrey

More leisure rides here, in the countryside to the south-west of London. Like with the running map - there are clusters of lines in the Surrey Hills to the east of Guildford.

And similar patterns in the areas of heathland on the Surrey/Berkshire/Hampshire borders around Farnborough and Fleet.

Image copyright Strava.com / MapBox / Open Street Map

bbc.com,,Menulis untuk perangkat mobile,[],"Menulis untuk perangkat mobile

Layar telepon genggam yang relatif kecil tentu tidak cocok untuk menulis berita yang terdiri atas 20 paragraf. Untuk mobile berita idealnya sekitar 150 kata saja.

Menulis berita untuk perangkat mobile memerlukan keahlian tersendiri.

Kekuatan utama medium ini adalah portabilitas dan fleksibilitas. Tapi Anda juga perlu memahami keterbatasan medium mobile, agar bisa memanfaatkan secara maksimal keunggulan medium ini.

Ukuran layar adalah salah satu kelemahan perangkat ini. Oleh karena itu gaya penulisan berita mau tidak mau harus disesuaikan dengan keterbatasan ini.

Makin pendek makin baik

Jadi, usahakan berita tidak terlalu panjang. Pikirkan dengan baik struktur berita sebelum Anda menuliskannya.

Dengan begitu Anda bisa memilih kata-kata yang sesuai dengan isi berita, kata Mohamad Susilo, wartawan BBC Indonesia.

Intinya adalah untuk perangkat mobile, berita yang Anda tulis harus pendek. Di BBC Indonesia biasanya berita untuk mobile ini terdiri atas 150 kata, kata Susilo.

Sederhana

Sebagian besar pengguna telepon genggam membaca berita melalui layar kecil, jadi Anda sebaiknya memakai bahasa yang sederhana yang mudah dibaca dan dimengerti.

Kosa kata yang sederhana juga akan membantu, ketika Anda berbicara dengan pembaca global.

Pengguna bisa di mana saja. Di Afghanistan, Irak, Afrika, Amerika, kata Susilo.

Mereka semua seharusnya bisa langsung memahami berita yang Anda tulis, katanya.

Jangan terlalu panjang

Ingat, ketika Anda menulis untuk perangkat mobile, makin pendek makin baik.

Menulis dengan panjang 20 paragraf atau lebih tidak masalah untuk situs berita dengan pembaca yang mengakses situs berita melalui komputer.

Tapi 20 paragraf akan terlalu panjang untuk dibaca melalui layar telepon genggam yang biasanya berukuran kecil.

Jadi:

Batasi tiap berita sekitar 150 kata, yang biasanya terdiri dari empat atau lima paragraf pendek

Hilangkan kata-kata sifat, kalau memang tidak terlalu diperlukan

Pakai singkatan

Teknik sederhana ini akan membantu memperpendek berita-berita yang Anda tulis.

Judul berita

Judul berita sebaiknya sederhana tapi juga menarik.

Dengan begitu Anda bisa menarik perhatian pembaca.

Idealnya untuk judul ini tak lebih dari 38 karakter. Bila melebihi 38 karakter, judul akan menjadi dua baris di layar telepon genggam.

Anda tentu tidak ingin membuat judul yang terlihat terlalu panjang di layar telepon genggam. Sebagai panduan umum, jika judul Anda sekitar 38 karakter, judul ini tidak akan menjadi dua baris.

Dengan begitu judul ini akan terlihat lebih bagus di layar telepon genggam.

SMS berita

Teks yang Anda tulis kadang juga diterbitkan dalam bentuk SMS berita. Teks ini akan muncul di layar secara otomatis selama beberapa saat.

Tulis teks yang pendek dan sederhana, kata Hassan Mhelela dari BBC Swahili.

Di BBC Swahili, kami batasi hanya 140 karakter untuk judul dan ringkasan berita, kata Hassan.

Ingat, Anda bisa memperpendek judul dan berita dengan menghilangkan kata sifat dan dengan memakai singkatan.

Kutipan

Kutipan sangat penting, tapi penting juga untuk diingat bahwa hanya kutipan yang pendek saja yang cocok untuk layar berukuran kecil.

Hindari kutipan yang panjang, yang bertele-tele. Pakai kutipan pendek dan memang benar-benar diperlukan.

Jadi, ambil yang bernas dan sisipkan sedemikian rupa sehingga akan ada impak secara maksimal.

Pilihan kata

Pilih kata secara hat-hati untuk mencegah distorsi makna di berita Anda.

Anda tidak akan pernah tahu siapa yang akan membaca berita Anda. Mungkin pembaca ada di Afrika, Afghanistan, Amerika atau Eropa.

Jadi, tulis berita yang mudah dipahami secara universal.

Agar berita Anda jelas bagi pembaca global, hindari jargon atau istilah khusus dan pergunakan kata yang tidak akan disalahartikan atau disalahpahami.

Cek, cek, dan cek lagi

Kesalahan gampang sekali terjadi. Itu sebabnya Anda perlu mengecek berulang-ulang.

Begitu kesalahan diterbitkan, akan terlambat untuk memperbaikinya.

Dan seluruh dunia bisa melihat kesalahan ini.

Prinsipnya adalah perbaiki kesalahan sebelum diterbitkan, kata Mohamad Susilo dari BBC Indonesia.

Perbedaan dialek

Dalam bahasa apa pun Anda menulis berita, hindari dialek.

Kata-kata yang Anda pakai bisa disalahpahami, baik dalam bahasa Anda sendiri maupun dalam variasi bahasa atau dialek.

Jadi, kesadaran ini perlu Anda miliki.

Baca berita Anda secara cermat.

Tanyakan kepada Anda sendiri, apakah orang di Indonesia atau di Malaysia akan memiliki pemahaman yang sama saat membaca berita Anda.

Berita yang Anda tulis harus memiliki makna yang sama ketika dibaca oleh semua orang.",[]

bbc.com,,Who would play you in a movie?,[],"Who would play you in a movie?

We spoke to Producer, Lucy Bacon and Psychiatrist, Dr Farhana Mann about how they created 'Who would play you in a movie?'

Tell us about the pilot

Lucy Bacon: ""To coincide with the launch of movie award season were giving you the chance to find out who would play you in the movie of your life.



Through a set of questions were finding out about all aspects of your personality  and once youve answered each question well tell you which Hollywood A-Lister would take the lead role in your own biopic.""

So how did you calculate the results?

Lucy Bacon: ""Our personality questions are based on established research by University of Oregon professor Lewis R. Goldberg  and we worked with University College London psychiatrist Dr Farhana Mann to refine the test and personality profiles.

Film critic Rhianna Dhillion reviewed the personality profiles and matched these against Hollywoods great and the good.

As an added bonus  and something you wont find in your average online quiz  you can compare your scores to the rest of the country. Finding out where you fit in the grand scheme of things, when it comes to different aspects of your personality. We collated this data from over 1500 British people who completed a similar online quiz."" You can find out more about this here.

Whats the science behind the questionnaire...

Dr Mann: We based this project on questions from the International Personality Item Pool  and the widely cited Big Five personality test. (Goldberg, L. R. (1992). The development of markers for the Big-Five factor structure. Psychological Assessment, 4, 26-42.)



The development/discovery of these aspects of personality goes back to original research in the 1940s by psychologists like Raymond Cattel, Tupes & Cristal and Costa & Mcrae. Over time, other researchers have rigorously analysed the responses of thousands of people who were asked questions about their personalities/ways of doing things/approaching situations. The researchers pooled together all the information gathered and analysed it for patterns or traits/characteristics that tended to cluster together.



They found 5 main groups into which the data was consistently clustering together. And these groups were: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism or OCEAN. And thats what weve used to create this questionnaire.

And one final  very important note - this questionnaire isnt about diagnosing or labelling, its about finding out a little bit about yourself and having fun!

bbc.com,,Clues to why the 'sea dragons' died out,"['Bbc News', 'Helen Briggs']","Image copyright Andrey Atuchin Image caption The ichthyosaurs swam alongside early sharks and bony-finned fishes

A dramatic shift in the Earth's climate killed off marine reptiles that swam at the time of the dinosaurs, according to a new study.

About 100 million years ago, the oceans warmed up, polar ice melted and sea levels rose to unprecedented heights.

Scientists say the ichthyosaurs, or ""fish lizards"", could not adapt to the new conditions, spelling their demise.

The research is the latest twist in the mystery of how and why the predators disappeared.

Evidence suggests their extinction about 100 million years ago was driven by intense climate change and their inability to adapt to the changing world.

""Our results support a growing body of evidence revealing that rising sea levels and sea temperatures profoundly reorganised marine ecosystems about 100 million years ago,"" said lead researcher Dr Valentin Fischer of the University of Liege, Belgium, and the University of Oxford, UK.

""The ichthyosaurs were unable to adapt. They were evolving very slowly during the last 50 million years of their reign.

""When the environment changed very rapidly they couldn't keep up with this change.""

Family tree

During the age of the dinosaurs, the ocean was home to many types of ichthyosaur.

The marine predators evolved a streamlined body like a dolphin and were built for speed, feeding on fish and squid.

Ichthyosaurs endured for millions of years. They appeared in the Triassic, reached their peak in the Jurassic, then disappeared in the Cretaceous - several million years before the last dinosaurs died out.

Past explanations for their disappearance have focussed on their food supply, which may have dwindled as other marine animals such as sharks and bony fishes appeared.

The researchers - from the UK, Belgium, France and Russia - think this was just one factor in the animal's demise.

After drawing up a detailed family tree of the evolution of ichthyosaurs and analysing the causes of their extinction, they believe many factors were to blame.

""Although the rising temperatures and sea levels evidenced in rock records throughout the world may not directly have affected ichthyosaurs, related factors such as changes in food availability, migratory routes, competitors and birthing places are all potential drivers, probably occurring in conjunction to drive ichthyosaurs to extinction,"" Dr Fischer added.

'Super greenhouse world'

Dr David Martill of the University of Portsmouth, who was not involved with the study, said the move to a ""super greenhouse world"" would have had a huge impact on the habitats of animals on land and in the sea.

Ichthyosaurs shared the ocean with other great groups of large marine reptiles such as the plesiosaurs and mosasaurs, however, which managed to outlive them.

""They [the ichthyosaurs] just disappear while a lot of animals living alongside did alright,"" Dr Martill told BBC News.

""Some mysterious thing was involved. I think it's still an enigma.""

The famous fossil hunter Mary Anning discovered the first complete fossil of an ichthyosaur in the cliffs near Lyme Regis, Dorset, in 1810.

Her discovery shook up the scientific world and provided evidence for new ideas about the history of the Earth.

bbc.com,,Perguntas frequentes feitas sobre publicidade nos sites BBC,[],"Por que a BBC resolveu incluir publicidade em seu website?

Atualmente, alguns desses sites, produzidos em diferentes idiomas, ja carregam alguma publicidade e comerciais estao presentes tambem em transmissoes em FM, de Berlim.

bbc.com,2016-03-16 00:00:00,Restoran cepat saji KFC buka restoran pertama di Tibet,[],"Image copyright Getty Image caption Beberapa pegiat menentang pembukaan restoran KFC di ibu kota Tibet, Lhasa.

Jaringan makanan cepat saji KFC untuk pertama kalinya membuka restoran di ibu kota Tibet, Lhasa.

Foto-foto yang diunggah di internet memperlihatkan orang-orang antre, sementara karangan bunga dan karpet merah ditempatkan di luar restoran yang terletak di pusat perbelanjaan tersebut.

""Sebagai penggemar berat KFC dan harus antre lama, saya sangat senang ketika akhirnya bisa mendapatkan es krim,"" kata seorang pengguna media sosial di Lhasa.

Restoran KFC ini dibuka meski beberapa kelompok di Tibet secara aktif berkampanye menentang kehadiran jaringan restoran dari Amerika Serikat tersebut.

Para pegiat dan juga Dalai Lama -pemimpin spiritual Tibet di pengasingan- mengatakan bahwa ayam-ayam yang diambil dagingnya untuk menu ayam goreng, mendapat perlakuan yang sangat buruk, yang tidak sesuai dengan nilai-nilai yang dijunjung tinggi oleh warga Tibet.

Tibet dikuasai Cina sejak 1950-an dan kantor berita resmi milik pemerintah di Beijing, Xinhua, mengatakan 'masuknya merek-merek Barat akan membantu pengembangan bisnis' di Tibet.

KFC masuk ke Cina pada 1987 dan sekarang memiliki lebih dari 5.000 restoran di sekitar 1.100 lokasi di seluruh Cina dan rencana pembukaan restoran KFC di Tibet diumumkan Desember lalu.

Operasional KFC di Cina dijalankan oleh perusahaan setempat, Yum Brands.",[]
