foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,International Women's Day: How can we best honor the courage of persecuted women?,[],"Imagine living every day, every moment of your life in fear. That is the reality of thousands of women around the world. They have reason to fear because they are Christians living in places where the worship of Jesus is forbidden and because they are females in countries where women are not afforded even the most basic human rights. In far too many places, Christian women are targets of violent persecution.

Tuesday is International Womens Day, a day when we celebrate women, past and present, for their remarkable contributions to society. But it should also be a day when we celebrate the courage of women who stand up for their faith even under threat of torture and death.

Just last week, 16 people were shot to death, including four nuns, in a retirement home in Yemin run by a charity established by Mother Teresa.

Last year, Batima,* a Kyrgyzstani Christian was beaten by her siblings after converting to Christianity. Violence against Christians in Pakistan is also increasing. In January, a Christian teenaged girl was killed and her two-friends injured when they were attacked by a group of Muslim extremists.

In Bangladesh, the growing Christian minority population is facing increased restrictions and persecution. One reported incident was of 20-year-old Christian woman who was gang-raped in the Bangladeshi city of Dhaka. And we must not forget the 219 Christian school girls from Chibok, Nigeria, who were kidnapped by Boko Haram militants nearly two years ago.

Many more Christian women are indirect victims of persecution, having been widowed by brutal attacks on their husbands from groups such as ISIS and Boko Haram.

In January, I met with Gladys from Nigeria and she told me of how her husband was captured, tortured and burned alive while out sharing his faith in Christ along with a pastor friend. Gladys told of how she viewed her husbands charred corpse without realizing that she was looking at her own husbands remains. And she related how she was speaking out about how God is sustaining her in the aftermath of this horrible murder. Her faith humbles me.

These are just a few examples of how Christian women have been targeted and persecuted for their faith. For each story told, there are hundreds of others left untold.

Because Islamic terror groups are the leading driver of the global persecution of Christians, as their reach increases, so too does the threat to Christians in general and Christian women in particular. The Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Rep Ed Royce, R-Calif., drew attention to the plight of women living under ISIS rule in a hearing he convened last summer. In opening the hearing, Royce noted:

Violence against women is in fact a sinister and calculated strategy that goes to the heart of ISISs survival. By forcing local women to marry into ISIS, the group expands its demographic base while reducing the population of those diverse communities it seeks to eradicate and replace. Simply put, ISIS needs women  needs to control them  to establish its caliphate and give rise to the next generation of ISIS.

And so I return to International Womens Day. As we contemplate the significance of this occasion, I would put one question to us all: How best can we honor persecuted women on International Womens Day? I recommend we take a multi-pronged approach.

First, we must continue to advocate on behalf of the persecuted with Americas leaders and international bodies like the United Nations.

Second, we need to support efforts to provide practical aid, spiritual encouragement and safe haven to those who have been persecuted or remain under threat of persecution.

And finally, all people of faith must continue to pray for the persecuted. As I have the privilege of meeting brave women who remain committed to their Christian faith in the face of persecution, over and over again I hear one thing: Encourage Christians in the West to pray that we will remain strong and faithful no matter what may come. Their faith inspires me to keep fighting for them every day.

On this day dedicated to honoring women, wont you join me in praying for all those enduring or living under threat of persecution for their faith?

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,3 days of mourning for former first lady Nancy Reagan begin,[],"Three days of formal mourning for former first lady Nancy Reagan were set to begin Wednesday.

Daughter Patti Davis, dressed in black, greeted friends upon arrival at a Santa Monica mortuary where a brief service was scheduled before a motorcade was to take the casket about 45 miles to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley for the first of two days of public viewing.

Several dozen spectators gathered outside, including a few from the hospital across the street.

""She was just a very classy woman, always,"" said Jeanie Maurello, a medical assistant at Providence St. John's Health Center. ""I thought she did a wonderful job. `Just Say No' to drugs, she was behind all that.""

Another medical assistant, Lupe Salazar, said she was also an admirer. ""She did a lot of work that helped the country,"" Salazar said.

Maurello added: ""There's always a great woman behind every great man.""

Eight Secret Service agents who served the Reagans were to serve as pallbearers to transfer the casket from the funeral home to a hearse for the drive to the library in the hills northwest of Los Angeles.

Friday will be the funeral -- which was planned down to the smallest details by the former first lady herself. Just as she was always by his side in life, Nancy Reagan will be laid to rest just inches from her husband on a hillside tomb facing west toward the Pacific Ocean.

Before her death she planned the funeral's flower arrangements, the music to be played by a Marine Corps band and the people who received invitations to the private memorial.

Among those who had RSVP'd for the service were former President George W. Bush and his wife, former first lady Laura Bush; former first lady Rosalynn Carter; first lady Michelle Obama; and former first lady Hillary Clinton.

""No doubt about it, the most important of her special requests was that she be laid to rest right next to the president, as close as possible,"" said John Heubusch, executive director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library.

""The way the tomb is constructed,"" he continued, ""her casket will literally be set forth in the ground inches from President Reagan's.""

The hourlong service, to which approximately 1,000 people have been invited, was to take place on the library's lawn. On a clear day the gravesite affords visitors ocean views.

Those with White House connections who have said they will attend include President Richard Nixon's daughter Tricia Nixon Cox and President Lyndon Johnson's daughters Lynda Bird Johnson Robb and Luci Baines Johnson. Other guests will include Katie Couric, Chris Matthews, Newt and Callista Gingrich, Anjelica Houston, Wayne Newton and Mr. T, the Ronald Reagan Foundation said Wednesday. Mr. T was involved in Mrs. Reagan's ""Just Say No"" anti-drug efforts during the 1980s.

Capt. Christopher Bolt, commanding officer of the USS Ronald Reagan, will also be in attendance.

""One of our saddest situations is we have so many people who have called or written, saying they would like to attend, but unfortunately it needs to be by invitation only because we only have so much room on the lawn,"" Heubusch said. ""As a result, Mrs. Reagan was very adamant about having some time where the public could come by and pay last respects.""

Public viewings are scheduled at the library from 1 to 7 p.m. on Wednesday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Thursday.

First ladies' funerals, once a quiet affair, changed significantly following the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's widow, Eleanor Roosevelt, in 1962.

Mrs. Roosevelt, a United Nations delegate, author and prominent political figure in her own right, tried to keep the event fairly quiet, limiting the guest list to 250 people, although those guests included President John F. Kennedy, former Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, and future President Lyndon Johnson. More than 1,000 mourners jammed the streets outside the church in Hyde Park, New York.

The most recent first lady's funeral was for President Gerald Ford's widow, Betty, in 2011. Some 800 people, including Mrs. Reagan, attended a private memorial service for her in Palm Springs, California, followed by a second, smaller service in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan.

When former President Richard Nixon's wife, Pat, died in 1993 some 4,000 people attended a public viewing for her at the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, California. A private service took place the next day, and Mrs. Reagan and her husband were among those who attended.",[]

foxnews.com,2014-05-05 00:00:00,Demystifying flying: What is an air pocket?,['Tom Bunn'],"If youve been a passenger in an airplane, its likely that you have felt an air pocket, or what feels like a quick drop in the air.

""Air pocket"" is merely another term for ordinary turbulence. You might feel as if you're falling from the sky, but rest assured, if you flying commercially, you rarely gain or lose more than about twenty feet, especially if the plane is on autopilot.

The term ""air pocket"" comes from early aviation, a time when pilots flying open-cockpit biplanes took adventurous locals on a rides in their flying machines. These planes, with two wings one above the other, flew at relatively slow speeds. When the plane entered air that, instead of simply sitting there, was flowing slightly upward or slightly downward, the plane's path was altered slightly upward or slightly downward. Air pockets do not technically exist, yet it's an expression that has caught on and is still misused today.

So what happens when you experience a bumpy ride that rattles glasses and turns some knuckles white?

The first thing you need to understand is a basic rule of flying: the earth has different surface temperatures that impacts flight as the aircraft passes through. For example, the surface of a lake is cooler than the surrounding earth, or plowed fields have a different surface temperature than those that are unplowed. Warm air is lighter than cool air. Warmed air rises. Cooled air descends. When a plane encounters varying airflow, we can feel what we call an air pocket today.

The idea of an ""air pocket"" might seem reassuring from a pilot's point of view, for a pocket is something you slip your hand into. When you do, your hand can only go so far. But, over the years, the phrase has come to be thought of as an area where there is no air. With no air, what is going to hold the plane up?

The term, if misunderstood, can lead to fear that an ""air pocket"" - a place devoid of air - could be big enough to cause a plane to plunge to the earth or go out of control. But it doesn't exist.

It may be helpful to try to imagine a ""water pocket,"" an area in a lake where there is no water. You can't, right? Since you can see water, it is hard to conceive of such a thing as a water pocket.

One analogy that is helpful to my clients is picturing the sky as one large bowl of Jello. Imagine that large bowl of chilled Jello with a small, plastic airplane in the middle. Now, pick up the bowl and shake it. The airplane certainly moves and jiggles, but it is impossible for the small plastic toy to fall out of the bowl (the sky).

Flying through an ""air pocket"" isn't much different from driving your car over a pot hole or steering a boat over waves. It may be bumpy, but you're rarely in danger --that is unless you're not wearing a seat belt.

The ring, which had been in England since the 15th century, sold at auction for more than $400,000 (about 30 times its estimated worth), the Telegraph reports.

Purchased by the Puy du Fou foundation, which runs a historical theme park in western France, the ring arrived home on Friday, the BBC reports.

The foundation's president praised the ""glorious return"" of a ""French treasure."" Inscribed with ""IHS"" and ""MAR"" (for Jesus and Mary), the silver gilt devotional ring was made in about 1400.

It will be officially unveiled this month, according to reports. Joan of Arc herself describes the ring in transcripts from the trial that ultimately led to her 1431 execution in Normandy (then ruled by the English) on charges of being a heretic and sorcerer.

It is believed that she gave the ring to England's Cardinal Henry Beaufort the day before she was killed at age 19. Centuries later, a man bought the ring in a 1947 auction for about $250.

He passed it on to his son, Robert Hasson of Essex, who discovered the ring's value after taking it to be appraised by Timeline Auctions. Committed to turning back an English invasion of France, Joan of Arc led forces into battle and advised French royalty.

A devout Catholic, who claimed to receive divine guidance, she was canonized as a saint in 1920.

Now, environmentalists fear a Mojave Desert population will be eradicated entirely by a plan that's apparently meant to save them, the Los Angeles Times reports.

The Marine Corps' Air Ground Combat Center in the Mojave will soon expand 165 square miles into the tortoises' habitat and officials have come up with a $50 million plan to move the tortoises elsewhere.

In what a base rep tells the Desert Sun is an effort ""to safeguard the animals,"" 100 biologists will capture 900 adult tortoises and transport them to three sites via helicopter over four to six weeks in the spring.

Another 235 juveniles will be raised in pens, then moved once they're no longer vulnerable to predatory birds. The biologist that's heading the project (which was approved by the US Fish and Wildlife Service) says the budget ""demonstrates how much we care about this species"" and will allow officials to monitor the animals for 30 years.

But critics aren't so sure. The Times notes tortoises become stressed when handled by humans and vulnerable to predators, dehydration, and disease when moved to unfamiliar areas.

A similar project that moved 670 tortoises away from the Army's National Training Center in 2008 was halted when 90 tortoises died. Another 9,136 were moved to a site in Nevada between 2004 and 2014, yet only 370 could be found there in 2015.

An environmental planner at the base counters thusly: ""We've learned a lot from past mistakes of others. We wouldn't be doing this if we felt the desert tortoise wasn't viable in the Mojave.""

(Photo: OMAR TORRES/AFP/Getty Images)2013 AFP

Pemex is flailing.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nietos much-vaunted energy reforms  which ended the state-owned oil giants seven-decade monopoly over the oil and gas sector  have not provided the shot in the arm the company needed to climb out of an 11-year slump.

On the contrary: the final quarter of 2015 saw the company post losses of $10.1 billion, the worst in its 75-year history.

God knows whats going to happen to Pemex at this point: They owe more than theyre worth right now. Without deep cuts, the company has no future. - Dwight Dyer, energy editor at Mexico Citys El Daily Post

Those arent the only daunting numbers facing Pemex, which was formed in 1938 when Mexico nationalized the holdings of all oil companies. But the company's production has dropped for 11 straight years now, while gross income plummeted more than 80 percent last year.

Beyond that, the governments current drive toward austerity is expected to push down output by a further 100,000 barrels over the course of 2016, mainly because meaning that deep water exploration projects  which are Pemexs big bet for long-term viability  are expected to be postponed.

With a view to plugging the financial hole in Pemex  which brings in between a quarter and a third of Mexicos annual tax revenue  Pena Nieto appointed a new company CEO, Jose Antonio Gonzalez Anaya, a Harvard and MIT graduate with a penchant for cycling.

Three weeks into his tenure, Gonzalez Anaya appears to have started his new post with confidence, dismissing Pemexs issues as short-term financial difficulties in a conference call with investors in February and presenting $5.5 billion worth of budget cuts to the Pemex board on Friday.

Gonzalez Anaya's job is to define what Pemex 2.0 is going to look like, Tim Samples, assistant professor at the University of Georgias Terry College of Business, told Fox News Latino. ""His predecessor [Emilio Lozano] was a reform CEO, steering the company through Pena Nieto's game-changing reforms. Gonzalez Anaya has a more complicated job.""

For one thing, he will have to brave some serious economic headwinds. Pemexs initial projections for 2016 were based on oil prices of $50 per barrel. The current prices has been fluctuating between $25 and $35. Meanwhile, adding injury to injury as Samples put it, the peso lost 17 percent of its value against the dollar.

Which, if anything, is likely to buy Gonzalez Anaya time.

Its not his fault that the oil market is performing so miserably across the board, said Samples. This would be like blaming him for the weather.

One thing that is in Gonzalez Anaya's control, however, is cutting Pemex to the bone, according to Dwight Dyer, energy editor at Mexico Citys El Daily Post and a former senior analyst at the global consulting firm, Control Risks.

That task, Dyer told FNL, may prove easier said than done.

Pemexs workforce is bloated and inefficient, as Dyer notes. The company employs 153,085 staff in Mexico alone  more than double what Norways Statoil employs in 36 countries around the world.

Meanwhile, Pemexs six refineries are operating at just over 60 percent capacity, and they have a checkered safety record to boot. Three Pemex workers died in fires last February alone, with another fire claiming seven lives last year took place in a Bay of Campeche facility.

Gonzalezs job is about helping Pemex muddle its way through a vale of tears, Dyer said. Hes essentially administering a bankrupt company. God knows whats going to happen to Pemex at this point: They owe more than theyre worth right now. Without deep cuts, the company has no future.

Both Dyer and Samples agree that foreign investment represents a degree of light at the end of the tunnel  albeit one thats a long way off.

We cant judge the energy reforms too extensively in the short term, since many of the auctioned projects wont bring a return for 10, 20, maybe even 30 years, Samples said. But one good indicator is that auctions are being held in an orderly way, attracting bids in a difficult price climate.

For Dyer, that long-term hope is all that is keeping Pemex viable in the short term.

The litmus test will come at the end of this year, when the oil company is set to auction off deep-water oil blocs to private investors.

These so-called farm-out agreements  which will see Pemex hire private companies with better infrastructure to drill on its behalf  are necessary to extract an estimated 29-million-barrel oil bonanza lying beneath the seabed of the Gulf of Mexico.

In order to attract these investors, however, Pemex is going to need to become a leaner, more efficient machine.

""The potential worth of the country's deep-water reserves are essentially keeping Pemex afloat now,"" said Dyer. ""To capitalize on that potential, Gonzalez Anaya has to find a way to make the company more streamlined. Otherwise, when the deep-water auctions roll around on Dec. 5, Pemex may not be seen as a viable partner for farm-outs, meaning Mexico [will be] forced to sell its fields for much less than theyre worth.""

Whatever positive results come from the energy reforms are likely to come too late to save Pena Nietos economic legacy  but the threat that the reforms themselves might be overturned by the next administration seems for now to have been averted.

Pena Nietos already a lame duck, said Dyer. He wont be able to deliver on his election promises. He got his reforms passed, and some of them have actually worked. The telecommunications industry, for instance, is already becoming more competitive. But if Pena Nieto was wise, hed begin lowering expectations ahead of the next round of auctions, resisting the urge to oversell their potential to the electorate and instead focus on explaining why things didnt work out as expected.

But the rosiest of outcomes is entirely outside the control of either Mexicos president or Pemexs new chief.

Dyer said, With a rise in international oil prices, things may start to look more promising.

foxnews.com,2016-03-01 00:00:00,Is the Doomsday Clock still relevant?,[],"Seven minutes to midnight. Five minutes to midnight. Three minutes to midnight.

Last month, experts with the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists announced that the ""Doomsday Clock,"" an iconic symbol meant to represent humanity's risk of facing global calamity, was stuck at 3 minutes to midnight, despite a historic climate agreement reached in Paris just a few months earlier. As part of their reasoning, the atomic bulletin scientists cited the nonbinding nature of those Paris climate accords, the rise of hostility between superpowers and the proliferation of more ""modernized"" nuclear weapons that may be more tempting to use.

But the minute hand of the clock has been stuck just a snack break away from global apocalypse for decades. And the Doomsday Clock now encompasses more than just nuclear threats. [End of the World? Top 10 Doomsday Threats]

Given that, the Doomsday Clock may not be the right tool to mobilize people to actually change things for the better, experts say.

""I don't think that using apocalyptic rhetoric helps us to do the hard work of discussing difficult and complicated issues in a democracy,"" said Katherine Pandora, a history of science researcher at the University of Oklahoma.

Powerful symbol, muddled message

Originally conceived in 1947 by a cadre of former Manhattan Project physicists, the clock was meant to symbolize how close humans were to nuclear annihilation.

And as a visceral and powerful symbol, it hit the mark.

""All of us have experienced events in our lives when the matter of a few moments could change everything,"" Pandora told Live Science in an email. ""The clock metaphor calls up associations with the gut-level emotional impact of living through those moments and their aftermath, adding to its power as a symbol.""

Now, however, the Doomsday Clock represents not just the threat of nuclear annihilation, but also the threat of global climate change, hostile killer robots, malevolent genetic engineering experiments and cyberterrorism. All those threats are legitimately frightening, but with such a grab bag of threats, the symbolism of the clock has been a bit muddied, said Anders Sandberg, a philosopher at the Future of Humanity Institute at the University of Oxford in England.

""It's not an exact measure and it's also combining several things,"" Sandberg told Live Science. ""It was perhaps much easier when they started, when it was just nuclear war, but since then we have gained other existential risks.""

From alarm to action

What's more, focusing on the big picture may not be the most effective strategy for getting people to fix the problems. Solving nuclear proliferation is tricky enough; add in forestalling climate change meltdown, and many people feel paralyzed, Sandberg said.

People typically do better with more bite-size challenges. For instance, adding buttons to prevent the accidental detonation of nuclear weapons was a small but significant step in avoiding nuclear war, Sandberg said.

The clock's conflation of current risks is also tricky because it's not really a numerical risk estimate, Sandberg said. And the clock publishers don't explain how they factor in potential future risks, such as artificial intelligence, he added.

""Without the right safeguards, it might be tremendously dangerous,"" Sandberg told Live Science. ""With the right safeguards, it's probably the opposite; it's probably the best things you can imagine: Having smart systems that actually help us.""

Persistent panic

The clock may be on target when it depicts how close humanity is to global catastrophe, Sandberg said. But persistently living on the precipice of destruction may inure people to the justifiably scary threats the Bulletin hopes to emphasize, Sandberg said.

""You can't live your life at 3 minutes to midnight,"" Sandberg said.

Pandora thinks the clock could even be counterproductive.

""Having authorities state that an emergency is at hand is an effective way to gain someone's attention and have them primed to take immediate action, which is the logic behind the clock's minutes-to-midnight gambit,"" Pandora said. ""Asking successive generations of people to sustain a constant sense of emergency is a contradiction in terms. The unintended effects of this directive can impede a successful resolution of the issue at hand and undermine the working relationship between experts and nonexperts.""

While the Doomsday Clock itself may not be an effective symbol, that doesn't mean all the work put into creating it is useless, she said.

""It is the prodigious amount of research and analysis that ground the conclusions in the reports that the [Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists] issues that are the real tools for mobilizing discussion among all of us on critical issues,"" Pandora said.

The State Department has released more than 52,000 pages of Clinton's work-related emails, but her private lawyers have withheld thousands more that they deemed to be personal communications unrelated to her job. Also left unresolved are questions about how Clinton and her closest aides handled classified information.

The AP Press last year discovered Clinton's use of the private email server, which had been set up in the basement of Clinton's New York home by former State Department staffer Bryan Pagliano, for her to use exclusively for her work-related emails while she was secretary.

The FBI for months has investigated whether sensitive information that flowed through Clinton's email server was mishandled. The State Department has acknowledged that some emails included classified information, including at the top-secret level. Clinton has said she never sent or received anything that was marked classified at the time.

The inspectors general at the State Department and for U.S. intelligence agencies are separately investigating whether rules or laws were broken.

Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Attorney General Lynch on Wednesday about media reports that the Justice Department had offered Pagliano immunity from criminal prosecution in exchange for his cooperation. Pagliano previously declined to testify before Congress, citing his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee chairman, asked Lynch whether Pagliano's immunity offer carried over to congressional committees. Grassley, R-Iowa, wants to recall Pagliano to testify if he has received immunity.

Lynch declined to answer the question.

""We don't go into details with the agreements that we have with any witness on any matter in ongoing investigations,"" the attorney general said.

""The consistency with which the department handles ongoing matters, whether they involve a famous last name (or not), is something that we take very seriously,"" Lynch said. ""We treat them the same, and that is how the public takes confidence in the investigations we conduct.""

Lynch also said she had not discussed the email investigation with anyone at the White House and did not plan to do so.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,NM Gov. Susana Martinez signs bill revising state's driver's license law,[],"After years of pressuring lawmakers and facing criticism from immigrant rights groups, New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez signed a bipartisan bill Tuesday that revises the state's immigrant driver's license law and puts New Mexico in compliance with tougher federal identification requirements.

The Republican governor signed the measure during a ceremony at Sunport International Airport in Albuquerque and announced that state residents won't need a U.S. passport to board a commercial flight as initially feared.

Under the new bill, New Mexico will stop issuing driver's licenses to new immigrant applicants regardless of legal status. Immigrants in the country illegally will be able to get a driver's authorization card by submitting fingerprints. Immigrants who already have licenses can skip the requirement.

In addition, residents will have the option to get REAL ID compliant driver's licenses or driver's authorization cards.

The REAL ID Act requires proof of legal U.S. residency for those who want to use state identification to access certain areas of federal facilities. New Mexico had no such requirement.

Martinez had tried repeatedly to repeal the state's immigrant driver's license law, but state Senate Democrats had blocked the measure.

This session, however, Martinez and lawmakers faced pressure to resolve their difference after the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the state wouldn't get an extension on tougher federal REAL ID mandates.

""It was a long five years,"" Martinez said. ""Today we say no more.""

Last year, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced it would give the state an extension on REAL ID mandates. That decision sparked uncertainty around the state after military bases said they were stop accepting New Mexico driver's licenses for entry.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security also said non-compliant driver's licenses would no longer be accepted to board commercial air flights.

The department has since given New Mexico an extension after state lawmakers passed the bipartisan proposal.

The Santa Fe-based immigrant rights group Somos Un Pueblo Unido called the new bill a ""loss"" for Martinez and said it had been amended enough to protect immigrants' rights. ""We are proud that both Republican and Democratic leaders in the state Senate stood up to Governor Martinez' long campaign to divide New Mexicans on this issue,"" the group said in a statement.

The group had originally opposed any legislation that created separate ""driver's permit cards"" or required fingerprints but reversed after Senate Democrats agreed to those provisions.

Martinez said the new measure was about public safety and not immigration. She pointed to the arrest of four Mexican nationals were taken into custody hours before the bill signing for trying to obtain New Mexico driver's licenses using false residency documents.

New Mexico Taxation & Revenue Department Secretary Demesia Padilla said until state officials are able to fully adopt the new law, authorities are expecting others to try to obtain licenses using fake documents.

""We have to be vigilant,"" she said.

Mitt Romney derides Trump voters as suckers. Others have sneered that Trump has an army of low information voters who have been duped, and that these people shouldnt be able to decide on the fate of a Grand Old Party. Trumps voters, the political class screams, have hijacked the Republican Party.

Another conservative commentator complained the other day that many of these voters have never even voted before and they are not even Republicans. Huh?

Isnt it a good thing that Trump is steering millions of new voters away from the Democrats and attracting them to the GOP? I thought we were told Republicans lost in 2012 because so many conservatives stayed home. Here they are.

The GOPs mighty establishment wing  the people who get rich off the game of politics -- pretend that theirs is the party of the working class, of blue collar virtue, and hard work, but now that the workers they supposedly represent are in revolt, apparently the problem is the voters not the party. This is insanity.

This is like the executives at Coca Cola blaming the stupid public for not liking New Coke. What kind of a company blames its customers when things go wrong? Inside Washington, there are no term limits on stupidity.

Former House Republican majority leader Tom DeLay advised on Fox this past Friday that Republicans should do all they can to stop Trump from getting a majority (though he will likely have a plurality) and then at the convention, throw Trump and his troublemaking voters under the bus and pick someone who got millions of fewer votes than Trump did. Delays point is that the party and its delegates, not the voters, should choose who the nominee is. He seemed to be saying: its our club and we make the rules. (Funny, Republicans just a few weeks ago were guffawing that Democrats had rigged their primary process.)

The rules of the party apparently say that Delay is right. So the master plan is to let the elites decide whats best for us.

Gee. I thought thats what liberals do!

Im no Trump enthusiast by any means  and I agree with some of what he says and believe that he is flat out wrong about the benefits of trade and immigration  which are substantial. Trump is often offensive and unpredictable.

But the Trump haters ought to get out and attend a Trump rally.

You will meet truck drivers, and soccer moms, and veterans, and taxicab drivers, and immigrants, and construction workers, and young people, and not a lot of Wall Streeters or political consultants. They are patriotic. They are seething in anger at both parties.

We've had eight years of a mostly failed Republican president followed by eight years of a failed Democrat in the White House.

Over this whole period many of these voters haven't seen a pay increase and many have seen their incomes fall -- while GOP political consultants rake in millions for losing.

The fact that four of the wealthiest counties in America are inside or near the Washington Beltway says everything voters need to know about how they are being bled dry by government.

Whenever I say anything nice about Trump I get scowls and lectures from my conservative friends in Washington that Trump voters dont believe in the principles of the Republican Party.

Wait. The Republicans in Congress just passed a budget that spends tens of billions more than when Democrats ran Congress. The GOP budget increases the deficit. I thought that key principles of the GOP were less government, balanced budgets and fiscal responsibility.

The Republicans have only themselves to blame for this working class revolt. These are voters who are horrified by what Obama has done to our country and they put their faith in Republicans to fix things  and they didnt. Worse, they havent even try.



And now the Republican brain trust is hatching a plan to effectively disenfranchise the Trump voters altogether. I hope Im wrong, but when the GOP loses again with this strategy, and Hillary Clinton is being sworn into office, the party leaders will scratch their heads and ask: Gee, where did all those Trump voters go?

The state requires 490 days of schooling to become a licensed cosmetologist. Students have to learn how to apply makeup, style and color hair and must pass a licensing exam to become a licensed cosmetologist.

Hair-braiding is barely taught in most cosmetology schools, but anyone wanting to make a few dollars by braiding hair  a practice most common in African-American communities, where traditional hair-braiding has been taught for centuries  has to go through the cosmetology licensing process.

Those 2,100 hours of training can cost as much as $20,000 in tuition and fees. Getting licensed also requires a high school diploma or GED, as if passing algebra was essential to understanding how to braid hair.

To put it simply, this is ridiculous, said Jessica Herrmann, director of legislative outreach for the Platte Institute of Economic Research. Hair braiders must not only obtain permission from the government, but also spend thousands of dollars on course instruction on coloring, men and womens cutting, waxing, home creative skills, skin and spa services and chemistry. This burdensome regulation creates a huge financial barrier to entry for this new class of entrepreneurs.

But skipping that lengthy and expensive process means facing the potential penalties for being an unlicensed cosmetologist. Those include fines of up to $25,000 and the potential of four years in prison.

Crews were responding to reports of a natural gas leak when the explosion occurred along a main thoroughfare north of downtown, Seattle Fire Department spokeswoman Corey Orvold said.

The cause was under investigation. There were no reports of any other injuries or anyone missing. Dogs were being used to go through the rubble just in case.

Video surveillance from the Olive and Grape Mediterranean Restaurant showed a bright flash at 1:43 a.m. and then the room shakes as debris falls from the ceiling. A large garage door covering the restaurant's front windows protected it from extensive damage.

""The Olive and Grape was lucky,"" owner Paola Kossack told The Associated Press in an email.

Bike shop owner Davey Oil said he arrived soon after the fire trucks.

""There were tons of flames leaping over what was already the rubble of Neptune coffee, which as you can see now totaled, gone,"" he said.

Crews were still dousing an active flame with foam as the Greenwood neighborhood awakened.

Residents were checking out the damage along with the rubble and glass that littered the streets. Workers from one cafe damaged in the blast poured coffee for firefighters.

Among the businesses damaged or destroyed were Neptune Coffee, Mr. Gyro and the bike shop G&O Family Cyclery. An apartment building and another nearby residential structure were evacuated.

""Our block is a pretty close-knit block and this is pretty terrible,"" Oil said.

Chocolati Cafe manager Darla Weidman said she was relieved the blast occurred overnight instead of 11 a.m. when the shop sometimes is packed with people.

""I know neighbors will do everything they can to support these businesses as they begin the long and challenging task to recover and repair from this incident,"" Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said in a statement. ""The city will also be there to do what we can.""

Puget Sound Energy spokeswoman Akiko Oda said gas service for the impacted buildings was shut off about an hour after the blast and the shutdown was later expanded.

The utility said it completed leak surveys for the block around the area and no leaks were found.

Oda says it will take time to determine what caused the explosion and the utility will be working with the Seattle Fire Department in the investigation.

Pipeline safety investigators from the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission were also on site.

Harborview Medical Center spokeswoman Susan Gregg said eight firefighters and a battalion chief were treated at the facility. None of the eight men and one woman was admitted to the hospital.

This new species, the first ever found in the eastern United States, was probably 20 to 30 feet long as an adult and lived during the late Cretaceous Period, roughly 83 million years ago. It mostly walked on its hind legs, though it could come down on all four to graze on plants with teeth that are similar to modern day horses and cows. It had a scaly exterior and a large crest on its nose.

This is a really important animal in telling us how they came to be and how they spread all over the world, said Florida State University Professor of Biological Science Gregory Erickson, one of the authors of a paper detailing the dinosaur in the findings the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

Related Image Expand / Contract File photo. (McWane Science Center)

The researchers named the new dinosaur Eotrachodon orientalis, which means dawn rough tooth from the east. The name pays homage to Trachodon, which was the first duck-billed dinosaur named in 1856.

The skeletal remains - a complete skull, dozens of backbones, a partial hip bone and a few bones from the limbs - were originally found by a team of amateur fossil enthusiasts alongside a creek in Montgomery County, Alabama in marine sediment. That would suggest the dinosaur likely was washed out to sea by river or stream sediments after it died.

Related: Fossil of massive crocodile found on edge of Sahara desert

When the group realized they had potentially discovered something of scientific importance, they contacted McWane Science Center in Birmingham, which dispatched a team to the site to carefully remove the remains from the surrounding rock.

During the late Cretaceous Period, North America was divided in half by a 1,000 mile ocean that connected the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. This body of water created two North American landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. Back then, Appalachia began roughly in Georgia and Alabama and stretched all the way north into Canada.

For roughly 100 million years, the dinosaurs were not able to cross this barrier, Jun Ebersole, director of collections at McWane Science Center, said. The discovery of Eotrachodonsuggests that duck-billed dinosaurs originated in Appalachia and dispersed to other parts of the world at some point after the seaway lowered, opening a land corridor to western North America.

They just needed to get off the island, he continued. From there, they became the cows of the Cretaceous.

The remains of Eotrachodon are housed at McWane Science Center in Birmingham and are currently on display in Ebersoles laboratory.",[]

After nine years of traveling the world, often surrounded by beautiful women, Jonathan Goldsmith, 77, the iconic Dos Equis spokesman, will be retiring later this year.

On Wednesday, Dos Equis, which is owned by Heineken, broke the news with a new 60-second spot that sends the Most Interesting Man on a one-way trip to Mars.

Check out the video here.

Goldsmith has portrayed the Dos Equis character, famous for the tagline, I dont always drink beer, but when I do, I prefer Dos Equis,since its debut in 2007. The line has spawned dozens of copycat memes and become a ubiquitous pop culture phenomenon.

The brand says the campaign has tripled the business since, with sales of its lager rising over 8 percent in 2015 alone.

So who will fill Goldsmith's considerably-sized shoes?

Company spokesman and VP of Marketing Andrew Katz wouldn't say but remarked that the new person will stay true the brand's authentic yet aspirational message.

""The essence of the brand is that you need to stay thirsty for life, whatever it is that you're doing,"" Katz told FoxNews.com. In addition to being intelligent, curious and portraying a larger-than-life lifestyle, the new spokesperson ""must be witty and very clever.""

Switching actors can be risky for any brand but Katz is hopeful their pick will appeal to the coveted millennial demographic.

""We're not walking away from the idea of the ""Most Interesting Man""-- we're going to be reboot it in a way that's relevant for today's drinker so the brand doesn't get stale,"" says Katz, likening the update to the James Bond franchise which has been successful for decades with different actors at the helm.

Dos Equis and other imported beers have experienced record growth in the increasingly crowded beer space. Katz knows that millennials have a lot of different brews to choose from and taste is important. Part of the reboot will help introduce Dos Equis to a new generation so the beer becomes a part of their usual repertoire.

But the brand wont abruptly abandon Goldsmith. Dos Equis has a social media campaign leading up to Cinco de Mayo using the hashtag #adiosamigo. Customers will have the chance to win some of the Most Interesting Man's possessions, like his mariachi suit, and even a grand prize trip to Mexico. Fans can pose with life-size cardboard cutouts of Goldsmith that will be distributed to grocery stores and bars later this month.

But who is really interesting enough to succeed Goldsmith? There are plenty of talented young faces out there we wouldnt mind sharing a beer with but here are a few actors we think may be worldly enough to pick up the mantle.",[]

Responding to a question on the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association's website, the 97-year-old religious leader said Christians must be completely dedicated and involved in their faith.

Graham explains in the BGEA ""My Answers"" post that while many are be tempted to stop attending church so they can focus on other weekend activities, such an approach to Christianity and Christ's love is not sustainable in the long run.

""People drop out of church for all sorts of reasons (and over the years I suppose I've heard them all!),"" the reverend begins, suggesting that some people have good reasons to leave their church, including if their pastor isn't preaching the Gospel.

Many times, however, people drop out of church simply because ""they want to do something else.""

""Perhaps they've found church boring, or people haven't seemed friendly, or it's become a meaningless routine. But these aren't true of every church  and often they're only an excuse to do something else,"" the religious leader says, adding that this age-old problem can be traced back to the New Testament, as seen in Hebrews 10:25, when some believers ""give up"" meeting together.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Questions about the Missouri religious objections proposal,[],"The state Senate early Wednesday gave initial approval to a measure to amend the Missouri Constitution to provide further religious protections for those objecting to gay marriage, advancing the proposal after a 37-hour filibuster by Democrats opposed to it. Here are some things to know about the proposal.

____

WHAT DOES THE PROPOSAL DO?

The proposed amendment to the Missouri Constitution would prohibit government penalties against those who cite ""a sincere religious belief"" while declining to provide goods or services of ""expressional or artistic creation"" for same-sex marriage ceremonies or celebrations. The measure cites photographers and florists as examples of those who could be covered.

Businesses would be protected if they deny services for a wedding or a reception that happens around the time of the wedding.

The measure also would shield clergy and worship places that decline to participate in such weddings.

____

WHY ARE LAWMAKERS DOING THIS?

The measure is in response to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling last June that legalized marriage of same-sex couples in all states and effectively overturned a provision in the Missouri Constitution that limited marriage to one man and one woman.

Republican lawmakers argued that the legalization of gay marriage could lead to attacks on the religious liberties of those opposed to it. Sen. Bob Onder, a Lake St. Louis Republican who sponsored the Missouri measure, cited lawsuits in other states against bakers and florists who denied wedding cakes and flowers for same-sex couples.

Opponents say civil rights of lesbian and gay people are under fire. Senate Democrats, who staged a roughly 37-hour filibuster from Monday afternoon to Wednesday morning in an effort to block a vote, argued it encourages discrimination against same-sex couples.

____

WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS?

Republicans, who control the Missouri Senate, used a rare procedural tactic Wednesday to end the Democratic filibuster on the measure, which then gained initial approval on a 23-9 vote. It needs a second vote, which is expected Thursday, to move to the House, where Democrats also are the minority and don't have the same ability as Senate Democrats to filibuster. GOP House Speaker Todd Richardson backs the proposal.

If passed by the Legislature, it would be on the ballot for Missouri voters to decide either in the August primary or November general election.

____

WHERE ELSE IS THIS HAPPENING?

Missouri is among more than 20 states that have Religious Freedom Restoration Acts on the books. Missouri law already bans state and local government agencies from substantially limiting people's right to follow their religious beliefs unless there is a compelling reason to do so.

The proposal in Missouri would go further by specifically addressing religious objections to same-sex marriage.

Lawmakers in Florida, which has a Religious Freedom Restoration Act, last week sent Republican Gov. Rick Scott a bill to specify that churches can't be forced to marry same-sex couples. Scott has said he will sign it into law.

A measure moving forward in West Virginia would let people cite religious objections to state actions in certain court proceedings, and the Georgia Senate approved a measure barring government penalties against individuals or organizations that decline to provide services to couples based on a religious belief about marriage.

Onder said the Missouri measure is intentionally narrower in scope than some of those that have faced a backlash  for example, a proposal in Indiana last year that sparked a storm of criticism from businesses and supporters of gay rights. The proposal was eventually revised.

____

HOW ARE PEOPLE REACTING?

The Missouri proposal is backed by some Christian organizations, such as the Missouri Catholic Conference and Missouri Baptist Convention, and by limited-government and individual liberty groups such as the Missouri Alliance for Freedom.

""Missouri Pastors and Priests should not be forced by government to perform same-sex weddings in violation of their deeply held religious beliefs,"" Alliance for Freedom President Ryan Johnson said in a statement, adding that individuals with religious convictions also should not be forced by government to participate in same-sex weddings.

The American Civil Liberties Union and the national LGBT advocacy group Human Rights Campaign are among those opposing the measure.

Steph Perkins, executive director of the Missouri LGBT advocacy group PROMO, said in a statement that the organization agrees that religion is a fundamental right, but ""those same religious beliefs cannot and should not be used as a reason to deny someone the same services that are offered to the rest of the public.""

Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton tweeted in support of the Democratic filibuster, and a tweet from Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign account also praised members who participated in the filibuster. A tweet from gay marriage opponent Sen. Ted Cruz's Republican presidential campaign account urged Missouri residents to remember which Democrats filibustered during the November elections.

The North's Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried photos on its front page showing Kim and nuclear scientists standing beside what outside analysts say appears to be a model warhead part -- a small, silverish globe with a ballistic missile or a model ballistic missile in the background.

The newspaper said Kim met his nuclear scientists for a briefing on the status of their work and declared he was greatly pleased that warheads had been standardized and miniaturized for use on ballistic missiles.

Information from secretive, authoritarian North Korea is often impossible to confirm and the country's state media have a history of photo manipulations. But it was the first time the North has publicly displayed its purported nuclear designs, though it remains unclear whether the country has functioning warheads of that size or is simply trying to develop one.

This also would be the first time Kim has been quoted directly about the miniaturized warheads.

""The nuclear warheads have been standardized to be fit for ballistic missiles by miniaturizing them,"" state media agency KCNA quoted Kim as saying as he inspected a nuclear facility.

""This can be called true nuclear deterrent,"" he added.

The latest developments from the reclusive country come amid heightened tensions following claims it tested a hydrogen bomb in January.

On Monday at State of Air Force briefing at Pentagon, the Air Force's top officer Gen. Mark Welsh told Fox News, that while the actions of North Korea are ""very worrisome,"" the country does not have the capability to put a nuclear warhead on top of a missile and shoot it at the United States.

North Korea warned Monday of pre-emptive nuclear strikes after the United States and South Korea began holding their biggest ever war games.

Tensions remain high after North Korea's recent nuclear test and rocket launch, which prompted the United Nations to adopt tough new sanctions.

PODCAST: Listen to Todds indepth interview with Jacob Ellenhorn

Stephen Smith, an adjunct professor and executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation, accused Yiannopoulos of being known for his anti-feminist and more broadly misogynist commentary.

Harmful speech has no place in the Trojan community, Smith wrote in a letter calling for Yiannopoulos to be disinvited.

Whatever Yiannopoulos has to say on campus, his invitation here calls into question the human values as well as the academic standards of the USC College republicans, he wrote. Controversial celebrity presenters may draw an audience, but the integrity of the USC College Republicans is rubbished by such content, the high standards of excellence we all try to uphold at USC are undermined, and the USC community as a whole is deeply offended on behalf of its women students, staff and faculty.

Ellenhorn admits that hes invited firebrand speakers like Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro.

They are claiming that because I invited them  I made students on campus feel unsafe, he said. No one has to listen to them. No one was forced to attend. For goodness sake  were adults. We should be able to handle other peoples opinions.

Senators are expected to hold hearings later this month to determine the young conservatives fate. But Ellenhorn doesnt seem to be all that intimidated.

He penned a fiery response to the complaint  accusing University Student Government of trying to castrate strong male voices into submission.

Bold.

Now, you might be wondering why Im dedicating this column to covering what some might consider a silly campus skirmish. But this is no silly skirmish.

Pew Research did a study a few months ago  revealing that 40 percent of millennials believe there should be limitations on free speech. Thats a disturbing number.

I suspect that our public universities are being used to foster such anti-American thinking. The Left isnt just opposing dissenting viewpoints. They are trying to silence opposing viewpoints.

Ellenhorn told me hes seen his fellow senators rant about all sorts of outrageous issues  but hes never tried to silence anyone. Hes never tried to have his opposition impeached.

Difference of opinion should be triumphed, he said. But what they are trying to do is shut difference of opinion down.

And they are in for a mighty big fight.

Im not going to stand down, he said. Im going to stand up. Im not going to be quiet.

Well said, Jacob! Thats exactly what you should do when faced with a leftwing bully. Stand your ground.

They are trying to silence me  and Im just going to get louder.

Jeff Brashares, 61, of Marysville, Ohio, is that person. Once a year he participates in CoasterMania, an event at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, where theme-park fanatics ride roller coasters from 6 a.m. until after midnight.

So it come as no surprise that his wife, Angie, calls him a coaster-crazy. After all, hes a member of the American Coaster Enthusiasts, and hes been chasing down thrill rides for the past 56 years. Just two years ago, he even convinced his wife to get married at a theme park and ride a coaster immediately after -- tux, wedding gown and all.

This summer, with an extended family in tow, he will be on the road checking out some new rides, including Banshee, a roller coaster at Kings Island in Ohio, and Wonder Mountains Guardian, an interactive 4-D ride at Wonderland in Canada.

Adrenaline junkies like Brashares will have a field day this summer with all the new coasters, daredevil water slides and terrifying drop towers that are opening across North America.

The diversity of new attractions opening for families to enjoy together this summer is incredible, says Paul Noland, president and CEO of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions.

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Florida's newcomers get chance to show their stuff as spring practice nears,[],"GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- The start of spring practice means different things in different years.

A year ago it was all about Jim McElwain, the first-year Florida coach and his task to turn around the program.

As the Gators prepare to open their second spring camp under McElwain on Wednesday, a large group of newcomers are front and center in what the Gators hope to accomplish. Players McElwain and his staff are banking on to continue the momentum the program built last season on the way to the SEC East championship.

A school-record 12 early enrollees joined the Gators in January to provide a jolt of energy to a team that after a 10-1 start last season, stumbled down the stretch in losses to Florida State, Alabama and Michigan.

Amid the hoopla of National Signing Day last month, the Gators took time to welcome the newcomers away from the spotlight. No ESPN announcements for this group.

""A lot of them didn't have the chance to go through signing day like a lot of people did,"" McElwain said. ""So we did one with our team. We introduced the guys, put them in Gator colors and showed some highlights and had them make a couple of comments.

""That was pretty good. Our guys enjoyed that.""

Are there immediate difference-makers that will come to the surface this spring? That will take time to answer.

The Gators should have a better idea of what impact the newcomers could have a month from now when the Orange & Blue Debut goes under the lights at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium on April 8.

For now, here is a preview heading into spring practice:

TOP POSITION BATTLE

Same as last spring: quarterback. The difference is rather than Treon Harris and Will Grier vying for the job, the heart of the competition is expected to be between transfers Luke Del Rio and Austin Appleby. Del Rio joined the program last summer after transferring from Oregon State and has an advantage in that he knows the offense. Appleby arrived in January as a graduate transfer from Purdue with one year of eligibility remaining. Appleby has the advantage in experience. He played in 17 games at Purdue, starting 11, and threw for 2,777 yards, 19 touchdowns and 19 interceptions. True freshmen Feleipe Franks and Kyle Trask are also in the mix. The addition of Franks, a former LSU commit, was big news during the recruiting cycle. Trask, listed at 6-foot-4, 230 pounds, has a strong arm but is short on experience after serving primarily as a backup in high school. The Gators are optimistic both can make their mark, but for now, Del Rio and Appleby will probably get first crack at the job.

TRUE FRESHMAN TO WATCH

There are more than usual to choose from, but defensive back Chauncey Gardner is a player with an opportunity to contribute immediately. The UF secondary lost three key members in Vernon Hargreaves III, Keanu Neal and Brian Poole. Gardner (5-11, 197) starred at Cocoa (Fla.) High and earned a spot on the USA Today All-Florida Team. A two-way standout in high school, Gardner could provide depth in the fall with a strong spring camp.

NEWCOMER TO WATCH

Appleby is certainly at the top of the list, but so is kicker Eddy Pineiro, a redshirt freshman who transferred from ASA Junior College in Miami. Pineiro is a former soccer player who was ranked as one of the nation's top kicking prospects. He was signed to help alleviate Florida's kicking woes, highlighted by the struggles of Austin Hardin, who converted just 5 of 14 field goals in 2015.

READY TO THRIVE

Junior cornerback Jalen Tabor played at a higher level than Hargreaves last season according to many. Tabor was certainly good and based on his steady improvement during his two seasons, appears primed for a breakout season in 2016. Often overshadowed by Hargreaves in the media a year ago, Tabor has the potential to be a first-round NFL draft pick this time next year with a strong season.

TEMPO SETTER

Florida's defense lost a lot of experience in defensive linemen Jon Bullard and Alex McCalister, linebacker Antonio Morrison and the aforementioned defensive backs. However, the unit earned a big victory when linebacker Jarrad Davis opted to return for his senior season. Davis was perhaps the most-improved player on the roster in 2015 and like Tabor, is primed for a big season and bigger role in the locker room.

SLEEPER TO WATCH

Defensive tackle Thomas Holley arrived at UF as a promising talent but has been hampered by a hip injury that required surgery. He has played sparingly but based on recent eye tests, Holley has lost weight and looks in excellent shape as he tries to make an impact along a defensive line that could certainly use his athleticism. Holley was a standout basketball player in high school and can move when healthy.

KEY QUESTION

What will the offensive line look like? This group started well a season ago but struggled at times in the second half. The biggest positive is that true freshmen Martez Ivey, Tyler Jordan and Fred Johnson gained valuable experience and showed why they were top recruits. The Gators lost starters Mason Halter and Trip Thurman, but junior David Sharpe returns and a group of redshirt freshmen that includes T.J. McCoy, Nick Buchanan, Brandon Sandifer, Donovan Welch and Richerd Desir-Jones will battle it out this spring to define their roles. Veterans Antonio Riles, Travaris Dorsey and Cam Dillard also return.

NOT RUNNING ON EMPTY

Running back Kelvin Taylor rushed for more than 1,000 yards last season and opted to forego his final year of eligibility to enter the draft. That could cause a coach to be concerned. Not so much in McElwain's case. The Gators recruited well at the position in 2015 by signing Jordan Scarlett and Jordan Cronkrite. Both contributed as true freshmen and they have company this spring in junior-college transfer Mark Thompson (6-2, 228). Thompson played two seasons at Dodge City (Kan.) Community College and was ranked the No. 1 junior-college back in the country after rushing for 1,298 yards and 18 touchdowns as a sophomore. All three players should get plenty of touches this spring.

QUOTE OF NOTE

""Excited about getting the type of new blood in, those different position groups and different meeting rooms, bring a little energy, a little competition. An opportunity to really work on some guys as to how you go about your daily business and how you go about getting better every single day."" -- McElwain on addition of newcomers.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,GOP sues State Department over access to Clinton emails,[],"Republican senators pressed for more information Wednesday about an FBI investigation into the potential mishandling of sensitive information that passed through former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server, and their party sued for copies of the messages.

The Republican National Committee filed two lawsuits in U.S. District Court in Washington over access to electronic messages sent or received by the Democratic presidential candidate and her top aides during her time as the nation's top diplomat.

Both spring from Freedom of Information Act requests filed last year seeking copies of emails and text messages. In court filings, the GOP says it has not received any documents in response to the requests.

The GOP litigation brings the total to at least 34 civil suits so far involving requests for federal records related to Clinton's service as secretary of state between 2009 and 2013. The Associated Press is among those with a pending case at the Washington courthouse.

""For too long the State Department has undermined the public and the media's legitimate right to records under the Freedom of Information Act, and it's time it complies with the law,"" said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.

The State Department has released more than 52,000 pages of Clinton's work-related emails, but her private lawyers have withheld thousands more that they deemed to be personal communications unrelated to her job. Also left unresolved are questions about how Clinton and her closest aides handled classified information.

The AP Press last year discovered Clinton's use of the private email server, which had been set up in the basement of Clinton's New York home by former State Department staffer Bryan Pagliano, for her to use exclusively for her work-related emails while she was secretary.

The FBI for months has investigated whether sensitive information that flowed through Clinton's email server was mishandled. The State Department has acknowledged that some emails included classified information, including at the top-secret level. Clinton has said she never sent or received anything that was marked classified at the time.

The inspectors general at the State Department and for U.S. intelligence agencies are separately investigating whether rules or laws were broken.

Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Attorney General Lynch on Wednesday about media reports that the Justice Department had offered Pagliano immunity from criminal prosecution in exchange for his cooperation. Pagliano previously declined to testify before Congress, citing his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee chairman, asked Lynch whether Pagliano's immunity offer carried over to congressional committees. Grassley, R-Iowa, wants to recall Pagliano to testify if he has received immunity.

Lynch declined to answer the question.

""We don't go into details with the agreements that we have with any witness on any matter in ongoing investigations,"" the attorney general said.

""The consistency with which the department handles ongoing matters, whether they involve a famous last name (or not), is something that we take very seriously,"" Lynch said. ""We treat them the same, and that is how the public takes confidence in the investigations we conduct.""

Lynch also said she had not discussed the email investigation with anyone at the White House and did not plan to do so.",[]

So-called super lice have invaded 25 states, frustrating parents and students alike as regular treatment proves to be no weapon against them.

Regular over the counter treatment had a 100% success rate in 2000 against head lice, but now only work in about 25% of cases. It seems the bugs have evolved to develop resistance to it.

A new FDA-approved treatment called AirAlle which was developed by Lice Clinics of America has been found to be effective, but treatments cost about $170 without insurance coverage.

It uses heated air to dehydrate the lice and eggs in a single treatment that takes about an hour. The company guarantees effectiveness.

Parents should teach their children about the repercussions of sharing hats, hairbrushes, and coming into contact with anothers hair. For those who do get lice, parents should rely on what they know to get it under control.

foxnews.com,2016-03-03 00:00:00,"Why did ancient Europeans just disappear 14,500 Years Ago?",[],"Some of Europe's earliest inhabitants mysteriously vanished toward the end of the last ice age and were largely replaced by others, a new genetic analysis finds.

The finds come from an analysis of dozens of ancient fossil remains collected across Europe.

The genetic turnover was likely the result of a rapidly changing climate, which the earlier inhabitants of Europe couldn't adapt to quickly enough, said the study's co-author, Cosimo Posth, an archaeogenetics doctoral candidate at the University of Tubingen in Germany.

The temperature change around that time was ""enormous compared to the climactic changes that are happening in our century,"" Posth told Live Science. ""You have to imagine that also the environment changed pretty drastically.""

A twisted family tree

Europe has a long and tangled genetic legacy. Genetic studies have revealed that the first modern humans who poured out of Africa, somewhere between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago, soon got busy mating with local Neanderthals. At the beginning of the agricultural revolution, between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago, farmers from the Middle East swept across Europe, gradually replacing the native hunter-gatherers. Around 5,000 years ago, nomadic horsemen called the Yamnaya emerged from the steppes of Ukraine and intermingled with the native population. In addition, another lost group of ancient Europeans mysteriously vanished about 4,500 years ago, a 2013 study in the journal Nature Communications found.

But relatively little was known about human occupation of Europe between the first out-of-Africa event and the end of the last ice age, around 11,000 years ago. During some of that time, the vast Weichselian Ice Sheet covered much of northern Europe, while glaciers in the Pyrenees and the Alps blocked east-west passage across the continent.

Lost lineages

To get a better picture of Europe's genetic legacy during this cold snap, Posth and his colleagues analyzed mitochondrial DNA  genetic material passed on from mother to daughter  from the remains of 55 different human fossils between 35,000 and 7,000 years old, coming from across the continent, from Spain to Russia. Based on mutations, or changes in this mitochondrial DNA, geneticists have identified large genetic populations, or super-haplogroups, that share distant common ancestors.

""Basically all modern humans outside of Africa, from Europe to the tip of South America, they belong to these two super-haplogroups that are M or N,"" Posth said. Nowadays, everyone of European descent has the N mitochondrial haplotype, while the M subtype is common throughout Asia and Australasia.

The team found that in ancient people, the M haplogroup predominated until about 14,500 years ago, when it mysteriously and suddenly vanished. The M haplotype carried by the ancient Europeans, which no longer exists in Europe today, shared a common ancestor with modern-day M-haplotype carriers around 50,000 years ago.

The genetic analysis also revealed that Europeans, Asians and Australasians may descend from a group of humans who emerged from Africa and rapidly dispersed throughout the continent no earlier than 55,000 years ago, the researchers reported Feb. 4 in the journal Current Biology.

Time of upheaval

The team suspects this upheaval may have been caused by wild climate swings.

At the peak of the ice age, around 19,000 to 22,000 years ago, people hunkered down in climactic ""refugia,"" or ice-free regions of Europe, such as modern-day Spain, the Balkans and southern Italy, Posth said. While holdouts survived in a few places farther north, their populations shrank dramatically.

Then around 14,500 years ago, the temperature spiked significantly, the tundra gave way to forest and many iconic beasts, such as woolly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers, disappeared from Eurasia, he said.

For whatever reason, the already small populations belonging to the M haplogroup were not able to survive these changes in their habitat, and a new population, carrying the N subtype, replaced the M-group ice-age holdout, the researchers speculate.

Exactly where these replacements came from is still a mystery. But one possibility is that the newer generation of Europeans hailed from southern European refugia that were connected to the rest of Europe once the ice receded, Posth speculated. Emigrants from southern Europe would also have been better adapted to the warming conditions in central Europe, he added.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,'Fifth Beatle' Sir George Martin dies at age 90,[],"Music producer Sir George Martin, best known for his work with the Beatles, died late Tuesday at the age of 90.

Martin's death was confirmed on Twitter by Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. His management said in an e-mail to the Associated Press that Martin had ""passed away peacefully at home"".

God bless George Martin peace and love to Judy and his family love Ringo and Barbara George will be missed xxx   #RingoStarr (@ringostarrmusic) March 9, 2016

Martin had been dubbed ""The Fifth Beatle"" for his work with the legendary rock band. He signed the Beatles to EMI's Parlophone record label in 1962 and went on to produce some of the most popular and influential albums of modern times -- ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" ""Revolver,"" ""Rubber Soul,"" ""Abbey Road"". Along the way, Martin and the Beatles elevated rock LPs from ways to cash in on hit singles to art forms, ""concepts.""

Martin later recalled meeting the quartet for the first time and realizing their potential, saying ""I liked them as people apart from anything else, and I was convinced that we had the makings of a hit group.""

However, he was not convinced they had songwriting ability.

""As composers, they didn't rate. They hadn't shown me that they could write anything at all,"" he once told the magazine Melody Maker. ""'Love Me Do' I thought was pretty poor, but it was the best we could do.""

Martin both witnessed and enabled the extraordinary changes of the Beatles and of the 1960s. From a raw first album that took just a day to make, to the months-long production of ""Sgt. Pepper,"" the Beatles advanced by quantum steps as songwriters and sonic explorers, turning the studio into a wonderland of tape loops, multi-tracking, unpredictable tempos, unfathomable segues and kaleidoscopic montages.

""Once we got beyond the bubblegum stage, the early recordings, and they wanted to do something more adventurous, they were saying, `What can you give us?""' Martin told The Associated Press in 2002. ""And I said, `I can give you anything you like.""'

Martin was endlessly called on to perform the impossible, and often succeeded, splicing recordings at different speeds for ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" or, for ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,"" simulating a calliope with keyboards, harmonica and a harmonium that the producer himself played with such intensity he passed out on the floor. Martin would have several good turns on the keyboards, performing a lively music hall solo on McCartney's ""Lovely Rita"" and a speeded-up Baroque reverie on Lennon's ""In My Life.""

After the group broke up, he started his own music publishing company, George Martin Music, and worked with a number of artists, including Jeff Beck, Bob Dylan, Sting and Sir Elton John. He also produced two of Paul McCartney's solo albums, ""Tug Of War"" and ""Pipes Of Peace"". He won six Grammys and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1996. Three years later, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

He co-produced ""Candle In The Wind,"" which was released to mark the death of Princess Diana in 1997. The song, which Elton John performed at Diana's funeral, sold 37 million copies, and was the last chart-topping hit Martin ever produced.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Stossel: What are libertarians doing wrong?,['John Stossel'],"In this year's Republican presidential primaries, Sen. Rand Paul got little traction. In 2012, his father failed. That year, the Libertarian Party candidate, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, got just 1 percent of the vote.

We libertarians must be doing something wrong. Maybe our anti-government message is too radical, says Jerry Taylor. Maybe we should soften our approach.

""Libertarians need to be more realistic,"" Taylor told 500 young people at a taping of my TV show at last week's International Students for Liberty conference. In electoral politics, he said, finding libertarians is ""like trying to find a daisy in Hiroshima"" after the nuclear blast.

Taylor, a smart libertarian who runs a think tank called the Niskanen Center, says to become more popular, we libertarians ought to change our views. He criticized Rand Paul for saying that in 1964 he would've voted against the Civil Rights Act.

Actually, Rand didn't say that. He supported the act's ban on government racism, like Jim Crow laws. He objected only to the act's ban on private discrimination. Rand was right to object. If owners of a private business want to serve only gays, basketball players or bald men, that should be their right.

Market competition will punish bigots for their narrow-mindedness, because some people will avoid that store. There's no need for government force.

""Right,"" said Taylor, but ""5 percent of the American public says yes to that, and 95 percent say no. ... They're not going to embrace a candidate who says, tough, people should just suffer under the teeth of bigotry because white people have that right.""

I suppose Taylor is correct. Voters prefer simple answers (""Mexico will pay for a wall!""). They don't want constitutional lectures about property rights or free association.

Taylor is fine with welfare spending, too. He points out, ""Even people like Milton Friedman and F.A. Hayek supported a safety net to help the indigent.""

Taylor and some other libertarians sound like ""reform Republicans"" who want free-market advocates to embrace the welfare state. They think they're being practical, realistic.

But we free-market supporters know what really creates prosperity and opportunity: economic freedom! We saw it work in America when America was young. We see it now in Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Switzerland, Australia and other countries that today offer more economic freedom than the United States. Government that governs least governs best.

I said to Taylor, rudely, ""Your plan for victory is to surrender?""

""No,"" replied Taylor. ""I don't think it's surrender to say that the rights and freedoms of people in this country can be secured by government.""

I don't either. But America's government has gone well past ""securing rights and freedom."" Today's welfare state provides much more than a safety net. It's become a giant hammock that encourages dependency. Government today takes half our money and micromanages the workplace.

But Taylor criticizes libertarians who complain about that and ""reflexively"" talk about ""taxes and spending and regulation. Other things are important too, like war! War is the engine of the growth of the state. Hundreds of thousands of people die.""

All true. We libertarians should probably talk less about taxes and more about what we'd do about ISIS and how to help poor people without using government force.

foxnews.com,2016-03-03 00:00:00,"Author finds news of $150,000 prize in her junk email -- and it was real",[],"According to the experience of Australian writer Helen Garner, it pays to check your email junk folder from time to time.

When the Melbourne resident recently took a quick look, she came across a message apparently from a Yale University employee who had some ""good news"" to share. The sender asked her to reply to the email with her phone number so they could call her about it.

Of course, with contents like that, it's hardly surprising it ended up in the junk folder, but something about the message made her wonder if it might actually have been misplaced by her email service's filters.

After speaking to her publisher and getting in touch with the university, the author learned she certainly did have some good news -- she'd won the prestigious Windham-Campbell literary prize that included a handy $150,000 payout.

Garner told the SMH that she ""nearly keeled over"" when she learned of the win.

Garner has written more than a dozen books -- both fiction and nonfiction titles -- with her most recent work, The House of Grief, delving into the case of a father accused of deliberately drowning his three young sons.

Eight other writers also picked up the prize, presuming they checked their junk folder, that is. Of course, had Garner ignored her junk messages or simply regarded the one from Windham-Campbell as a scam, Yale University would've found a way to let her know about her award. You'd hope.

But the incident nevertheless shows that it is worth dropping by your junk messages from time to time to see if anything genuine has inadvertently landed alongside those dodgy messages with subjects such as, ""Julia wants you to know about this great site,"" ""Interesting business proposal,"" and ""All lonely wives need a friend."" It could be a message from an old friend, a newsletter you actually want to read, or notification of a $10 million lottery win. OK, scrub that last one, but you get the idea.

As for the Windham-Campbell award, it's little wonder that recipients of the award were initially suspicious of the news ( two other winners also thought it was a scam). According to the organizer's website, ""The prizes have no submission process. Writers are judged anonymously and unaware that they are in the running. Most are genuinely surprised when they receive the phone call from Michael Kelleher, director of the prize.""

In a newly released letter seized during the 2011 raid that killed the Al-Qaeda leader, he urges Americans to launch a ""great revolution for freedom"" to untether President Obama from the influences of corporate lobbyists and fight climate change, Reuters reports.

Getting rid of lobbyists would let Obama make ""a rational decision to save humanity from the harmful gases that threaten its destiny,"" he writes. The rambling letter, which is addressed ""especially [to] the youth"" of America, appears to date from early in Obama's first term and includes references to the 2008 economic crisis, Mediaite reports.

Bin Laden apparently wasn't a fan of bank bailouts: America's financial system was 48 hours away from collapse when the administration used taxpayer money to ""rescue the vultures by using the assets of the victims,"" he writes.

In another letter, he argues that reducing greenhouse gas emissions would be a good way to mark the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, saying the world ""should put its efforts into attempting to reduce the release of gases"" instead of fighting Islam.

Both letters are unsigned, but US intelligence officials have attributed them to bin Laden. Also among the documents released Tuesday: a handwritten will that explained where his millions should go.

(An earlier release of bin Laden letters included love notes and warnings about sinister dentists.)

But although these pint-size kangas were short on bounce, they outperformed their fanged kangaroo relatives, which lived alongside them and eventually went extinct, researchers say.

In a recent study, researchers described a new kangaroo genus, Cookeroo, and two new species: Cookeroo bulwidarri, dated to about 23 million years ago,and Cookeroo hortusensis, which lived between 18 million and 20 million years ago.

Both species were found at the Riversleigh World Heritage area in northwestern Queensland, Australia, a location recognized as one of the richest fossil deposits in the world, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Center.

According to Kaylene Butler, the study's lead author, the new genus occupies a position near the base of the kangaroo family tree that includes all modern kangaroos and wallabies, their close relatives. Butler, a paleontologist at the School of Earth Sciences at the University of Queensland in Australia, told Live Science in an email that the team figured out where to place Cookeroo by comparing 119 different features representing 69 kangaroo species.

""Cookeroo is distinguished as a genus by the combination of a number of features on the skull and teeth""  points of comparison that were also used to distinguish between the two new species, Butler said.

The newfound minikangaroos are ""the size of very small wallabies,"" with bodies that probably measured about 17 to 20 inches (42 to 52 centimeters) long, Butler said. The landscape at the time was very different from the arid outback it is today, Butler said. C. bulwidarri and C. hortusensis likely inhabited a dense forest, moving through it on all fours and sharing it with a diverse collection of animals: marsupial moles, feather-tailed possums, ancient koalas and crocodiles.

Cookeroo also lived alongside other species of small kangaroos that were part of the ancestral group for kangas alive today, as well as a related group of fanged kangaroos, Butler told Live Science.The fanged kangaroos were also plant eaters, and they probably competed with the ancestors of modern kangaroos over their habitat's vegetation. ""However, the fanged kangaroos went extinct, while the ancestors of modern kangaroos continued to diversify and thrive,"" Butler said.

The direct competition between the two groups may have contributed to the fanged kangaroos' extinction, Butler suggested in a statement, though it is not certain what features provided Cookeroo with the advantage.

""The fossil record for kangaroos is quite rich,"" Butler said. ""We have giant kangaroos from the Pleistocene [2.6 million to 11,700 years ago] and Pliocene [5.3 million to 2.6 million years ago], as well as other sites similar in age to Riversleigh where we see our tiny ancestors of modern kangaroos as well as the fanged kangaroos.""

However, there is still much to learn about kangaroo evolution, and new fossil finds help to bring this ancient lineage more clearly into focus, Butler said.

""Hopefully, further study of these new species will help us understand just what is so special about the ancestors of modern kangaroos  why did they survive when, at the same time, the fanged kangaroos went extinct.""

The findings were published online Feb. 17 in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.

Thats the frosty message University of Oregon researchers are getting over a widely-ridiculed study on gender and glaciers that cost taxpayers a big chunk of cash.

Researchers at the school published a scientific study examining the relationship between gender and glaciers as part of a federally-funded government grant from the National Science Foundation.

The paper, titled Glaciers, gender, and science"" and authored by University of Oregon professor Mark Carey, found that ice is not just ice and called on scientists to take a feminist political ecology and feminist postcolonial approach when researching glaciers and climate change.

The study, which centers around ""feminist glaciology,"" was published in January and was part of a nearly half million dollar federal grant, according to The Free Beacon and College Fix -- though it's unclear how much of the $412,930 in funds went specifically toward Carey's paper.

Glaciers are key icons of climate change and global environmental change, Carey wrote. However, the relationships among gender, science, and glaciers -- particularly related to epistemological questions about the production of glaciological knowledge -- remain understudied.""

""Merging feminist postcolonial science studies and feminist political ecology, the feminist glaciology framework generates robust analysis of gender, power and epistemologies in dynamic social-ecological systems, thereby leading to more just and equitable science and human-ice interactions, the paper reads.

Writing on Powerlineblog.com, Steven Hayward called the study

""academic gibberish,"" and said he initially thought the paper was

parody.

Im sure Carey is well-intentioned, but if his goal was to put a human face on climate change, he failed, Robby Soave wrote in Reason magazine. The paper is simply impossible to read with a straight face. It employs liberal buzzwords -- colonialism, marginalization, masculinist discourses, etc. -- with such frequency that the entire thing comes off like a joke.

The University of Oregon said in a Feb. 26 press release that Carey hired undergraduate student Jaclyn Rushing to ""explore how nongovernmental organizations were addressing melting Himalayan glaciers.""

""Her dive into the literature found that women's voices are rarely heard in glacier-related research, a finding that triggered a larger project and led to a paper now online ahead of print by the journal Progress in Human Geography,"" the statement said.

The press release went on to quote Carey as saying, ""Jaclyn found a report that noted how women are more vulnerable to glacier changes and hazards than are men.""

""I had never researched these gendered vulnerabilities,"" said Carey, an associate dean of the Clark Honors College and a professor of history and environmental studies.

Carey did not respond to a request for comment when contacted Tuesday.

The National Science Foundation funded the study as part of a project that initially set out to examine the early development and subsequent evolution of the five main aspects of glaciology,"" according to The Free Beacon.

The paper poses the question, Why feminist glaciology? and then answers it by arguing that scientific research of glaciers has been dominated by men and masculinity.

""Most existing glaciological research -- and hence discourse and discussions about cryospheric change -- stems from information produced by men, about men, with manly characteristics, and within masculinist discourses, the paper says.",[]

We are saddened to share that our patient, Lindsey, recently experienced a sudden complication that led to the removal of her transplanted uterus, the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement Wednesday. At this time, the circumstance of the complication is under review and more information will be shared as it becomes available.

The hospital is exploring what went wrong, but said its clinical trial that aims to do 10 uterus transplants is continuing.

I just wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude towards all of my doctors, Lindsey said in a statement, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They acted very quickly to ensure my health and safety. Unfortunately I did lose the uterus to complications. However, I am doing okay and appreciate all of your prayers and good thoughts.

Doctors surgically removed the uterus Tuesday.

Other countries have attempted uterus transplants, with some reported failures, although Sweden has succeeded in five healthy births. The experimental treatment might eventually offer an option for women born without a uterus or who lost it to disease.

Named after the company's founder Conrad Hilton, ""Connie"" was developed specifically for the hospitality market.

By accessing domain knowledge from Watson and WayBlazer, Connie will be able to assist guests like a human would, informing them on the hotel where they're staying as well as surrounding attractions, for example.

What's more, Connie actually improves with every interaction.

""Watson helps Connie understand and respond naturally to the needs and interests of Hilton's guests  which is an experience that's particularly powerful in a hospitality setting, where it can lead to deeper guest engagement,"" Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of IBM Watson Rob High said in a statement.

Resembling a toy action figure, Connie is currently being piloted at the Hilton McLean near the company's Virginia headquarters, where its working alongside human Hilton team members.

While a recent survey conducted by Travelzoo shows that a majority of travelers around the world are ready and excited to interact with robots while traveling, guests will have to stay patient.

Hilton said that pilot testing typically takes anywhere from three to six months, during which ideas are tweaked based on feedback from guests and the hotel operator. And when the pilot period comes to an end, the company said it will ""weigh its value against its performance goals.""

""Our best tests become pilots at a diverse sampling of hotels across our portfolio,"" said Hilton. ""Our best pilots become beta tests, and only the very best scale globally.""

Nonetheless the pressure is on. According to Travelzoo's survey of 6,000 travellers in Asia, Europe, North America and South America, eight in 10 anticipate robots will play a significant role in their lives by 2020, while approximately two-thirds of travelers are comfortable with the idea of robots being utilized in the travel industry.

With the subsequent hiring of Lovie Smith -- a move that brought in more than 1,400 new season ticket sales in a single day -- Cubit's exit has become afterthought.

The 62-year-old Cubit has every right to be angry -- livid, even -- about what went down in Champaign, but he's decided he isn't going to burn any bridges after losing the biggest job he's ever been hired for without having coached a game.

""I'm not going to wallow in sorrow or self-pity,"" Cubit told the Chicago Sun-Times Tuesday. ""There has been a lot of negativity, and I swore I would not be negative. I swore that I'd be positive, even if things go against me. I don't want to waste a minute of my life being negative now. Life is too short.""

Cubit coached Illinois' entire 2015 schedule with an interim tag after the school fired Tim Beckman for allegedly interfering in medical decisions and pressuring players to play injured. Beckman denies the allegations.

The Illini went 5-7 under Cubit, and the belief was that the school would move on from the former Western Michigan head coach in the offseason. Instead Illinois removed Cubit's interim tag and awarded him a two-year contract.

Cubit's two-year deal was described by then-interim athletic director Paul Kowalczyk as ""not ideal.""

Illinois hired Josh Whitman as athletic director on Feb. 16. A few weeks later, without advance warning, Cubit was out. Smith was almost instantaneously hired. It was a quick swap.

Cubit told the Sun-Times he's focusing his concern towards the members of his staff who will likely not be retained by Smith, who has a $4 million war chest for assistant coaches, saying: ""Those guys put their faith in me.""

The college coaching profession is a messy one, but the diabolical situation at Illinois took what would normally be a bad scenario (one coach being fired and replaced by another) and turned it nuclear.

Whitman was right to make a swift move and start his regime with a clean slate, and while there are concerns that Smith will have trouble adjusting to a college gig, there's no question that the move is already considered a hit with boosters.

But while many are celebrating the possible turnaround of Illinois football, it's hard to see anything but the collateral damage.

Cubit is highly unlikely to get another Power Five head coaching job, and his soon-to-be-fired assistants are unlikely to catch on with another college team this year. Illinois football, even in a moment of positivity, still found a way to still be super depressing.

I could have gone longer on this flight if there was good reason, he said, during a press conference in Houston Friday. Whether its science, or going to a certain destination.

The former Navy pilot explained that he focused on milestones that were close to each other during his year in space, such as the next crew arrival or science project. That made a big difference to me, just for my sanity, he said.

The Soyuz capsule carrying Scott Kelly and his 340-day roommate, Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko, landed in Kazakhstan Wednesday. The astronaut arrived back in the U.S. early Thursday, via Norway and Canada.

Related: Astronaut Scott Kelly back on Earth after yearlong space mission

The yearlong stay on the International Space Station was Kellys fourth space mission - his previous stint on the space station, which ended in 2011, was 159 days. My level of muscle soreness and fatigue is worse than last time, he said Friday, adding that his skin is also very sensitive. In the space stations micro gravity, he explained, fewer objects touched his skin.

Kelly conducted hundreds of experiments during his 340 days in space. Scientists also studied the differences between the astronaut and his twin brother, Mark, back on Earth. They provided blood, saliva and urine samples, underwent ultrasounds and bone scans, got flu shots and more, all in the name of science.

This genetic-based research is new for us, so that for me is very exciting, said Kelly, during Fridays press conference.

The astronaut was also asked whether he has noticed any differences between him and his brother. Hes got a better tan, he quipped. I think its because he plays too much golf.

Related: Astronaut Scott Kelly was 2 inches taller after his epic year in space

Kelly also addressed his temporary height gain in space, which has generated significant attention. The low gravity of space elongated the astronauts spine during his time on the International Space Station, making him 112-inches taller on his return.

However, Kelly said that he is now the same height as his twin brother. Gravity pushes you back to size, he explained.

Kelly also revealed that the first food he ate on his return was a banana. He also took a dip in his swimming pool when he finally made it back to his home on Thursday. Even though I had a shower in Canada, I hadnt had running water for 340 days, he said. We make do with not having a shower on board [the space station]  I definitely feel like I would like jump in a pool.

Kelly also discussed the Microsoft HoloLens virtual reality technology that he tested in space. I think that VR has a lot of potential, he said, explaining that ground personnel could give astronauts information such as real-time drawings for spacecraft maintenance.

Related: Year in space paves the way for even longer missions, says Scott Kelly

Shortly after returning to Earth Wednesday Kelly said that his year in space will help fuel longer-term space missions, paving the way for NASAs ambitious plan to send humans to Mars.

He reiterated this message Friday. I think going to Mars, if it takes two years or two-and-a-half years, thats doable, he said. The first people that go there, that will be a big motivation, to be the first people that go to Mars.

NASAs goal is to send a manned mission to Mars by 2035  a vast roundtrip journey that could take 212-years.Radiation also poses a major challenge for Mars missions, along the durability of astronauts bodies and minds.

There are challenges that we have to meet, like the radiation issues, said Kelly. Maybe we have a propulsion system that gets us there faster - I think we know enough and were close enough.

Related: Yearlong spacemen embrace fresh, frigid air back on Earth

Kelly, however, does not expect to fly in space for NASA again. I doubt that I would fly again with NASA, having the most time in space, he explained. We have so many talented people in our office, they dont need me to fly again.

The astronaut, who says that he will never be done with space, nodded in the direction of private space companies. There are many exciting opportunities out there, maybe in the commercial aspect, he added.

Saturday at The Mandarin Hotel in New York City, wine enthusiasts from around the world gathered for Matter Of Taste, an exclusive event held by The Wine Advocate and eRobertParker.com featuring producers and vintages handpicked by the publications expert team.

We really only wanted the best of the best, said Lisa Perrotti-Brown, a Master of Wine and Editor in Chief of The Wine Advocate and erobertparker.com. It was almost like picking children. And in some cases it wasnt about whos the best known or whos the most famous. Its about little known people as well you really want to push out there.

One of the major criteria of the wines featured at Matter of Taste was that each wine had been scored a 90 or above on Robert Parkers highly regarded scoring system. According to the Robert Parker system, all wines begin with a score of 50, with a perfect score being 100. The average scores here are higher, said Monica Larner, Italian wine reviewer for The Wine Advocate and eRobertParker.com. It gives our subscribers a chance to connect with our palate and they can see where they stand on those wines as well.

Another aspect of Matter of Taste are the Master Classes which are held throughout the day. During these classes, the winemakers themselves explain the winemaking process from producing to storage, as well as the history of the regions they come from. Sometimes you need to meet the winemakers, thats the great thing about this. Its not just the wines, its the people behind those wines. Its the people who created this out of their vision, said Perrotti-Brown. One such class, A Century of Colheitas, featured vintage ports that were aged from fifteen years to a Taylors Colheita from 1863, which needed to be decanted and served at the precise temperature.

Events like Matter of Taste are part of a growing interest in wine, which include festivals from New York to Napa Valley, to films and television shows focusing on being a sommelier like SOMM and Uncorked. Millennials are drinking way more wine more than any other group, and spending more than the baby boomers on wine, said Perrotti-Brown. I really think its this younger generation thats coming in, theyre super excited about wine. Maybe they challenge our old ways and our traditions, and thats great.

The biggest way millennials have been engaging other in their love of wine is though social media. Whether its labels on bottles or pictures of glasses, it seems everyone is sharing what theyre drinking, as well as what their doing. The rise of the iPhone has affected the rise of wine, said Larner. I try to do three pictures a day on Instagram, one food picture, one kind of monument, and one wine label. And I always notice the one wine label gets more likes, gets more comments. Its always that. Perrotti-Brown added, My husband complains that I have more pictures of wine labels on my phone than I do of him.

So whether your enjoying a 98-point Sauternes from Chateau Suduiraut (featured at the event), or even a wine produced locally, its easier than ever to find a bottle to enjoy. What were all about at Matter Of Taste, is to make it be fun, to get rid of all the snobbery thats associated with wine, said Perrotti-Brown. Theres got to be something for everybody.",[]

Our goal is to ensure that minority and Latino programmers, actors, directors and artists have a fair shot at success. We believe our mission is more important than ever, especially when award shows still feature a lack of diversity in film.

As the independent programmers made clear, the FCCs regulation will only benefit a few online giants, which lobbied the FCC hard for this proposal. - Felix Sanchez

A 2015 Columbia University media study, co-commissioned by NHFA found that between 2000 and 2013, among the top 10 highest-grossing films annually, lead roles for Latinos dropped by half, from 2.8 percent to 1.4 percent. The percentages of Latino writers and producers were at 2 percent and 6 percent, respectively. According to the U.S. Census, Latinos comprise 17 percent of the nations population. At the same time, both USC and UCLA issued reports this week emphasizing that audiences crave diverse content.

We need policies that will increase those numbers, not decrease them in a time when our society is advancing toward a majority people of color demographic.

NHFA has a history of working with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to ensure federal policies can help overcome these challenges. However, the FCCs recent vote to issue new, sweeping rules for cable and satellite set-top boxes is one more unfortunate, depressing example of how society is preventing our community from fully participating in the entertainment industry, this time through a federal government regulatory action.

Strip away the public messaging blitz, and one can see that the FCCs proposal directly undermines the growth of quality entertainment, particularly emerging channels serving minority and niche communities, being made available to more consumers in more areas of the country. This approach takes away the basic rights of independent creators to control and monetize the content they create.

The new rules will allow these third party companies to redistribute any content broadcast by cable and satellite companies without paying the creators to use their works and without the federal privacy rules that cable and satellite providers must follow applying to them. All so they can expand their online Big Brother tracking of you to also include storing and leveraging data about your home TV viewing.

Thats why 18 independent programmers and content creators recently sent a letter to the FCC to voice their concerns. The list of signers includes big names in the media industry such as Ovation TV, TVOne, and UnbeliEVAable Entertainment founder Eva Longoria.

As the independent programmers made clear, the FCCs regulation will only benefit a few online giants, which lobbied the FCC hard for this proposal.

Recently, more than two dozen U.S. House Representatives, including 14 Congressional Hispanic Caucus members as well as members representing minority communities, also expressed concern to FCC Chairman Thomas Wheeler about this proposals impact on copyright protection, privacy and future programming for the Hispanic community.

The FCCs vote was a strike against media diversity. Instead, the FCC should adopt policies that enable independent and diverse programmers to continue building their businesses and creating quality content for their viewers without regulatory barriers or standards that may impede that important national imperative.

DEAR REPUBLICANS, IT'S TED CRUZ

What is the rationale for Marco Rubios candidacy?

The latest poll out from the classiest and most reliable Florida pollster, Quinnipiac University, says there is none.



After a week of disappointing elections for Rubio, the Florida Q Poll is the dagger to the heart of his presidential aspirations. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush can be happy that while his own bid failed, at least he killed the one his campaign staff called ""Judas."" Enjoy Fisher Island.



The poll shows frontrunner Donald Trump doubling up Florida freshman Rubio with less than a week to go before the winner-take-all contest for 99 delegates. Coming after a disastrous election night it should be enough to send Rubio packing.



The only argument for Rubios continued candidacy was the Romney Plan in which voters should support any candidate in any race that can beat Donald Trump or deny him delegates. It worked pretty well in Michigan where Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich soaked up the majority of delegates with their tie for second place behind Trump.



But there is no hope that Rubio can be the guy to stop Trump in Florida anymore. While Republicans have resisted Cruz, despite his repeated successes, it may be time for the party to admit that Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is quite right: Cruz is the only candidate who has any shot of denying Trump the nomination.



While there was a wintertime flirtation with Trump as the more establishment-friendly and malleable candidate for the GOP, springtime has brought a new realization that Trump could mean not just a general election wipeout, but also generational damage to the partys brand. Cruz has never been the GOPs dream date, but if he can beat Trump it may be enough.



As the latest WSJ/NBC News poll shows, Cruz runs best in a head-to-head matchup with Trump. It may be unthinkable for many country club Republicans that Cruz would be their best choice, but Rubios demise means that it is so.



Just two weeks ago, there were calls for Cruz to fall in behind Rubio for a unity ticket. Now, it seems very clear that unity will work in the other directions and that if the Republicans have a chance to stop Trump from taking over their party it will be Cruz at the top and Rubio as the junior partner.



The sincerity of Rubios attacks on Trump as a con man who is unfit for the presidency will be revealed by whether he not only drops out, but if he enthusiastically campaigns for Cruz in Florida for the next five days.

NEW POLL SHOWS HILLARY LEAD IN THE SUNSHINE STATE

The Hill: Hillary Clinton has healthy leads over Bernie Sanders in Florida and Ohio, where voters will cast ballots in Democratic primaries on March 15, according to a new poll. A Quinnipiac University survey released Wednesday found Clinton crushing Sanders 62 to 32 in the Sunshine State. Here, Clinton is boosted by a huge lead among women voters, who support her 69 percent to 24 percent over Sanders. Clinton also has an 8-point lead among men, and even has the advantage over the democratic socialist among those who describe themselves as very liberal. Young voters have been Sanderss bread and butter, but he and Clinton are tied among those under the age of 44 in Florida, each taking 49 percent.



What went wrong for Hillary in Michigan? - WaPos Philip Bump explains why the Democratic frontrunner lost what was supposed to be a safe state for her Tuesday night: Hillary Clinton lost the Michigan primary on Tuesday night, and the state pried open two critical seams holding her candidacy together...One thing that happened is that Clinton underperformed with black voters in the state. In Mississippi, which Clinton won easily, nearly two-thirds of the vote was black and it went for Clinton 9-to-1. Preliminary exit polling in Michigan suggests that only about a quarter of the electorate in the state was black -- and that Clinton's margin was closer to 2-to-1.



Bernie joins the fight in Ohio -Columbus Dispatch: A national voting rights organization - along with nine 17-year-old plaintiffs - is suing Secretary of State Jon Husted for his refusal to allow 17-year-olds to vote in next weeks presidential primary. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Democratic candidate for president, filed a separate suit on the matter in federal court. Sanders has strong support among younger voters...In Ohio, 17-year-olds can vote only to nominate candidates, not directly elect them. In the 2015 Election Manual, Husted claimed that since voters in presidential primaries are technically electing delegates, they cannot vote in those elections.

A 26-year-old woman received the transplant there on Feb. 24 and had appeared to be recovering well, even appearing briefly at a news conference on Monday. But according to a hospital statement Wednesday, the patient, identified as Lindsey, experienced a sudden complication.

We are saddened to share that our patient, Lindsey, recently experienced a sudden complication that led to the removal of her transplanted uterus, the Cleveland Clinic said in a statement Wednesday. At this time, the circumstance of the complication is under review and more information will be shared as it becomes available.

The hospital is exploring what went wrong, but said its clinical trial that aims to do 10 uterus transplants is continuing.

I just wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude towards all of my doctors, Lindsey said in a statement, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They acted very quickly to ensure my health and safety. Unfortunately I did lose the uterus to complications. However, I am doing okay and appreciate all of your prayers and good thoughts.

Doctors surgically removed the uterus Tuesday.

Other countries have attempted uterus transplants, with some reported failures, although Sweden has succeeded in five healthy births. The experimental treatment might eventually offer an option for women born without a uterus or who lost it to disease.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Rick Sanchez: Anti-Trump Latinos reaching record levels in Florida,['Rick Sanchez'],"As a lifelong Floridian, I can say were used to being coveted. So when Donald Trump comes to town  salivating and losing his mind at rallies  neither I nor anybody else down here are surprised.

Taking the big 99 delegates would be truly huge for Trump. Floridas delegates are winner-take-all and, for the past month, Trump has been consistently on top in all the Florida polls  signaling that he will take them all and thereby be well on his way to the nomination.

[Bendixon and Amandi] pollster found that Trump would get only 16 percent of the Hispanic vote, proving that if you continually insult and offend a certain minority group they will eventually repel you like the plague. Who knew, right? - Rick Sanchez

There is one problem though, the establishment GOP knows that and so does Sen. Marco Rubio. Both are trying to fight off the Trump victory in Florida that no longer seems inevitable.

But Trumps lead in Florida is dwindling. Ever since he went even more off the rails  and thats saying something for Trump  consistently and publicly engaging Rubio on his hands and penis size, Trumps numbers have actually begun to slide. His margins here used to be consistently in double digits, now theyre in single digits.

In the last couple of weeks, both Public Policy Polling and Quinnipiac showed Trump beating Rubio by 20 and 16 percentage points respectively. But a Monmouth poll this week shows Rubio (30 percent) closing the gap and now only eight points behind Trump (38 percent).

Knowing that, what can we expect from Trump? Id say its a safe bet that hell go even more bat st crazy. Trumps recent rally in Orlando may be just a precursor for whats to come. While on stage he asked his followers, many who are proud and committed white supremacists and even neo Nazis, to raise their right hands and repeat an oath of loyalty to him. No, it wasnt a heil Hitler salute, but it sure looked like one. Its as if Trump was taunting us, he had to know what that image would look like, right?

There is no question that Trump is desperate to take down the Florida Senator he refers to as little Marco and will do whatever it takes to do so. So when Rubio points out that Trump cant beat Hillary Clinton, Trump goes after both he and former Florida governor Jeb Bush.

I used to listen to Jeb Bush ... say that I couldnt beat Hillary Clinton, I would say to him  then what does that say about you? You cant beat me! And the crowd roared.

The irony is that Bush was right. Trump, by indulging the worst in GOP voters, made himself unbeatable to Bush. While Bush was trying to mend fences with potential GOP voters who have long felt the party had left them behind, Trump was mowing them down, insulting especially Latinos who by sheer numbers alone will likely decide who becomes the next president. That alone makes Trump all but a lock to lose the general election.

Heres why. According to a recent poll conducted by the Bendixon and Amandi research group, Trump would get absolutely slaughtered among Hispanic voters. The premier Latino pollster found that Trump would get only 16 percent of the Hispanic vote, proving that if you continually insult and offend a certain minority group they will eventually repel you like the plague. Who knew, right?

Think about it. Back when George W. Bush was getting more than 40 percent of the Hispanic vote, news reports talked about the death of the Democratic party in presidential elections. But since then, the Latino vote in presidential elections has eroded.

Senator and candidate John McCain got 31 percent of the Latino vote. Then it went down further when Mitt Romney got only 27 percent of the Latino vote, leading most analysts to conclude it had cost him the election. They were right.

Its virtually impossible to mathematically win the general election for president with less than 30 percent of the Hispanic vote  cant be done! Now imagine a candidate getting only 16 percent of the Hispanic vote. Down here in Florida, thats what we call muerto. Translation: Trumps candidacy in the general election is as good as dead.

Now add to that the enthusiasm factor and what you have is a likely landslide. Fueled by the recent GOP tendency toward immigrant bashing disguised as border security, and by Trumps highly charged, offensive and downright insulting language, young Latinos are registering to vote in record numbers even in places like Iowa, Alabama and North Carolina.

Its a double whammy for the GOP that promises to undo all the goodwill established by presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bush 43, who were all generally admired, respected and more importantly, supported by Hispanic American voters.

Can it get any worse for Republicans hoping to expand their base? At the rate things are going, and with Trump continuing to win primaries, the bad news is, yes it can. Hold on to your sombreros folks, the general election is going to get really bumpy.

In a recent exchange with TMZ, Carey stuck to her story of not knowing Jenny from the Block.

I still dont know her, she told the camera while leaving the Beverly Hilton Hotel earlier this week.

This so-called feud between the two divas was sparked in the early 2000s when Carey dropped the now infamous quote  I dont know her  when asked about her thoughts on Lopez.

She followed it up last year when she was asked about it and she said she was not trying to be funny. Just being honest, she said.

The incident then reared its ugly head recently when Lopez was captured using her phone while Carey sang at the 2015 Billboard Awards. It was Careys first performance at the awards show in 17 years.

Okay, first of all, that was not fair with the texting thing because I watched a lot of it. It was a long performance, okay? I watched most of it, Lopez defended herself on Watch What Happens Live.

Last week, she addressed it again on The Wendy Williams Show.

She's forgetful I guess! We've met many times. I don't know... I don't know her that well, she said.

There's still too much yet to accomplish -- like that best-ever Bulls' mark of 72 wins, another championship, maybe the MVP again.

Curry scored 41 points and became the first player in NBA history to make 300 3-pointers in a season, and the Golden State Warriors set another record in a season full of them by holding off the Orlando Magic 119-113 Monday night for their 45th straight home victory.

""To have protected our home court 45 straight games in the regular season, it hasn't been done in history, so that's a pretty special accomplishment,"" Curry said. ""That win record is still in reach.""

.@Money23Green gives special thanks to #DubNation after the Dubs' NBA record 45th-straight win on #WarriorsGround.https://t.co/5WeN0FSBxP  GoldenStateWarriors (@warriors) March 8, 2016

Curry didn't match his 51-point performance against the Magic on Feb. 25 in which he hit 10 of 15 3-pointers, but shot 7 for 13 from long range and also pulled down 13 rebounds. He has 301 3s with 20 games to go.

Golden State surpassed the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls' 44 straight regular-season home victories and improved to 27-0 at Oracle Arena this season.

Klay Thompson added 27 points for the Warriors (56-6), who overcame a season-high 24 turnovers to bounce back from an ugly 112-95 road loss to the Lakers on Sunday that snapped a seven-game winning streak.

Coach Steve Kerr said the ""46 turnovers in the last 36 hours, inexcusable. ... If we don't get that cleaned up then we're in big trouble.""

Steph right now: pic.twitter.com/680u9Hy90V  GoldenStateWarriors (@warriors) March 8, 2016

""What we have to get back to is simple, simple, simple,"" he said. ""The simple leads to the spectacular.""

The Warriors are still chasing the Bulls' record 72-win season. Golden State's home winning streak includes the final 18 games of last season before the franchise's run to its first championship in 40 years. The Warriors haven't lost a regular-season game at Oracle Arena since falling to the Bulls in overtime on Jan. 27, 2015.

Draymond Green told the fans afterward: ""45 straight home wins is incredible. Without you all, this would not be possible.""

Victor Oladipo capped a 7-0 run when he made two free throws with 1:13 left to cut the Warriors' lead to two. Thompson then hit a baseline 3-pointer under pressure with 52.5 seconds remaining and Curry followed with a layup and two free throws.

Aaron Gordon had 20 points and 16 rebounds in his Bay Area homecoming on a night Orlando played without leading scorer and center Nikola Vucevic because of a strained right groin.

During one impressive sequence late in the third, Curry dribbled inside of the arc then back out before knocking down a 3 while being guarded by 6-foot-10 Ersan Ilyasova.

Green had 10 assists and nine rebounds with one point after being questionable earlier in the day with an illness that sent him to see a doctor during the team's morning shootaround. Golden State shot 16 for 35 from beyond the arc.

GETTING DEFENSIVE

Kerr wants the Warriors to pick it up on the defensive end -- sooner rather than later -- before the pressure of the playoffs and quest for a repeat title.

Golden State doesn't typically hold shootarounds before playing on consecutive days, but with an early start Sunday at Los Angeles, Kerr ""felt we needed to come in and do some things.""

""I think there's been some slippage defensively the last few weeks and I think the numbers would bear that out,"" Kerr said. ""So we need to pick up our defense, we need to pick up our intensity. We're able to bail ourselves out at times with our shooting and scoring but we know that's not good enough against the best teams in the playoffs.""

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,'Bosch' star Jeri Ryan proud of bimbo-free career,['Paulette Cohn'],"Jeri Ryan plays a former stripper/hooker/porn star on the second season of the Amazon series ""Bosch,"" but her character is no bimbo.

Based on author Michael Connelly's novels about LAPD Det. Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver), the series has captured the hard-boiled school of detective fiction to a T.

Season 2 is based predominantly on the novel ""Trunk Music,"" providing Det. Bosch a major crime to solve, and the requisite femme fatale.

The seductress in question is played by Ryan, who takes on the role of Veronica Allen, who married an Armenian gangster/porn producer to give her a life of wealth and comfort.

""She's got quite a colorful past, and I think she gets Bosch a little bit unbalanced,"" Ryan told FOX411. ""He's not entirely sure what her real motives are. It takes him a while to figure out, I think, what's really going on with her.""

Ryan, of course, is best known for her role as the Borg Seven of Nine on ""Star Trek: Voyager,"" which featured her in a figure-hugging silver ensemble that left so little to the imagination that it may as well have been spray painted on.

The mother of two -- son Jack, 21, and daughter Gisele, 8 -- who graduated from Lone Oak High School in Paducah, Ky. as a National Merit Scholar, says she is comfortable playing blond bombshells if the character is written right.

""I don't have any interest in playing a bimbo,"" Ryan says. ""I don't have any interest in playing a character that's completely objectified, and I've been very lucky in my career that I haven't had to. So as long as the character is strong, smart and developed well, then I have no problem with what her physical appearance is or how she dresses.""

Sitting with Ryan in a suite at the historic Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood, it is obvious that if need be, she could still fit into her Seven of Nine outfit, which is amazing when you consider she is married to French chef Christophe Eme, who happens to be a fan of the Bosch novels, and that the couple owned and operated Ortolan in West Hollywood for seven years.

""I've always been a foodie, so I used to cook a lot more before I met my husband, because once you have a chef in the family, if he can do it better and 20 times faster, I'm going to let him do it,"" she says. ""But I do love to cook.""

Ortolan shuttered in 2011, so Ryan, who took a year off from acting to be in the front of the house for service at night and in the office during the day to get it going, is now back to juggling acting with motherhood.

""It's balancing having a career and being there for your family, which is more important to me,"" she says when asked her biggest challenge these days. ""Our daughter just turned 8; it just goes so fast, and my son is now 21. He's out of the house, so you blink your eyes and you miss it. I feel like I missed so much of my son's childhood when I was on 'Voyager' when he was 3 or 4 years old because I was on set all the time, so I was very determined that it was going to be a very different experience with my daughter, because I don't want to miss all this precious time.""

Season 2 of ""Bosch"" begins streaming on Friday, March 11 on Amazon.

The NRSC acknowledged the mistake and said the tweet was deleted within minutes. However, a spokeswoman for the group saw media bias at play.

It would be great if reporters would pay as much attention to a deleted tweet as they should to Tammy Duckworth being sued by VA whistleblowers for ignoring claims of mistreatment and corruption, the spokeswoman said.

This statement was in turn criticized by the groups Democratic counterpart.

The NRSC's deeply offensive tweet about Tammy Duckworth was wrong, and their subsequent response was somehow even more appalling, DSCC Executive Director Tom Lopach said in a statement.

Instead of taking responsibility and apologizing to Tammy, who lost both of her legs in service to this country, Republicans blamed the media. Thats unacceptable and Tammy is owed an apology, Lopach said.

The Haifa-based company said they have developed a placenta-based cell therapy injection that can fully cure patients with multiple organ failure caused by high radiation exposure.

Pluristem Therapeutics' Vice President of Medical and Clinical Affairs Dr. Esther Lukasiewicz Hagai said cells grown from placentas donated by women who had undergone a C-section, are harvested to create a cocktail of therapeutic proteins which combat potentially lethal damage to the lungs, skin, bone marrow and gastrointestinal tract caused by radiation exposure.

""We've been investigating the placenta for the last decade and we have discovered that the placenta cells have unique properties that can help the body to recover after exposure to high level of radiation,"" Lukasiewicz Hagai said.

""We are injecting these cells to the bodies' muscles...that will help the bone marrow to recover after radiation.""

The effect of the treatment has been tested on different levels of radiation, including a level of radiation that could cause up to 70 percent mortality rate, Lukasiewicz Hagai said.

In January Pluristem's PLX-R18 therapy was cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for clinical trials in animals.

Clinical trials which have been conducted both in the United States, with the National Institute of Health and at Hadassah-University Medical Center in Jerusalem, have shown a nearly 100 percent recovery rate in animals exposed to radiation.

Yaky Yanay, President and Chief Operations Officer at Pluristem Therapeutics and co-chairman of Israel Advanced Technology Industries (IATI), said clinical trials have so far shown optimal results if the vial is injected within 48 hours of exposure to lethal radiation.

""It will be very easy to use, off-the-shelf and readily available,"" Yanay said adding that it requires no DNA matches prior to administration into the muscle.

The only other available therapy is bone marrow transplant which requires DNA compatibility and is costly, he added.

In March 2011 the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant suffered the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl 25 years earlier, following an earthquake and tsunami.

The Tokyo Electric Power Co is still struggling to bring the situation inside its plant under control. It has estimated removing the melted fuel from the wrecked reactors and cleaning up the site will cost tens of billions of dollars and take decades to complete.

Pluristem Therapeutics has partnered with Japan's Fukushima Medical University to test its placental-derived cellular therapy for radiation treatment and has been asked to join the United States National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases program.

The goal of U.S. authorities, Yanay said, is to stockpile the treatment in the U.S. in case of a nuclear catastrophe.

""My wish that our therapy was available five years ago when we had the Fukushima disaster or 30 years ago when we had the Chernobyl not mentioning the Second World War which was a significant exposure to radiation,"" said Yanay.

""Our goal is to develop...a counter measure biological defense....for Acute Radiation Syndrome for any radiation event across the globe. It can be either a terror attack or nuclear melting but I hope that our therapy will be there"".

Pluristem's Chief Executive Zami Aberman said the uniqueness of the therapy treatment is in its ability to treat multiple organ failure and bring full recovery from the high radiation exposure.

""In radiation catastrophe the organ that are exposed to radiation are many, not only one of them. The fact that the cells have the capacity to treat multi organ failures give us the unique therapeutic potential,"" Aberman said.

The company said it received the rights to commercialize the placenta-based cell therapy products in 2007.

Israel sees a potential nuclear threat from Iran and has two nuclear reactors of its own. Israel is widely believed to have an atomic arsenal.

""We are living in an area which have a variety of threats including nuclear bombs and radiation catastrophes so we developed the product in mind that those may happen. When the Fukushima disaster happened it inspired our feeling that we have to do it stronger and quicker and we developed an aggressive plan in order to bring the product into awareness and today with NIH (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) support and the cooperation of the Fukushima center, we strongly believe that we can bring the product to cure many patients,"" said Aberman.

The next phase is to develop treatments for disorders like Crohn's Disease and other products to treat the central nervous system.",[]

Highway Patrol officials told the Kansas City Star that Pablo Antonio Serrano-Vitorino was arrested in Montgomery County, Missouri. He was found lying on a hill just north of Interstate-70 and no shots were fired, according to The Star.

""He looked exhausted,"" Sgt. James Hedrick said.

The suspect had a rifle with him, but federal law barred him from legally owning a gun because he is in the country illegally, according to John Ham, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives office in Kansas City.

Online court records show he was charged Wednesday in Montgomery County, Missouri, in the death of 49-year-old Randy Nordman. Nordman was shot Tuesday at his rural home near New Florence, about 70 miles west of St. Louis.

Serrano-Vitorino is also charged with four counts of first-degree murder in Kansas. Authorities there say he gunned down a neighbor and three other men late Monday before fleeing. Investigators haven't discussed a possible motive for the attacks.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said in a statement late Tuesday that Serrano-Vitorino was a Mexican national who was held at the Overland Park, Kan. Municipal Court on Sept. 14. The fingerprinting generated an ICE detainer, but the agency was erroneously issued...to the Johnson County Sheriffs Office, instead of the Overland Park Municipal Court.

The Department of Homeland Security said that Serrano-Vitorino was released from custody without ICE being notified, though they did not elaborate on why. ICE also confirmed that Serrano-Vitorino had been deported back to Mexico in 2004, but had since returned illegally.

It was not clear when he returned to the U.S.

The widespread manhunt for him, which started Monday, included helicopters, police dogs and at least one SWAT team. One of the four men shot that day managed to call police before he died, but it's unclear how the men knew each other or what may have prompted the shooting, Kansas City police officer Thomas Tomasic said.

A truck Serrano-Vitorino was believed to be driving was found about 7 a.m. Tuesday morning alongside Interstate-70 in central Missouri.

About 25 minutes later, sheriff's deputies responded to a shooting about 5 miles away at a Montgomery County home and found the body of 49-year-old Nordman, according to the patrol.

Highway Patrol Lt. Paul Reinsch said a witness who called 911 reported seeing a man running from Nordman's property, launching a manhunt of that area.

Reinsch said investigators weren't aware of any connection between Serrano-Vitorino and Nordman, whose home is near his family's campground and a racetrack for remote-controlled cars.

Police have not released the names of the four victims, but relatives identified three of them to the Kansas City Star as Mike Capps and brothers Clint and Austin Harter.

Stodden's mom, Krista Keller, revealed on Tuesday's episode of ""The Mother/Daughter Experiment: Celebrity Edition"" that she's also in love with her daughter's husband. So, that's awkward.

The surprising, cringe-worthy confession can be seen in this clip, where Keller explains to her daughter, ""I told your husband that I loved him.""

Keller confronted her daughter about having feelings for Hutchison and raised the troubling question, ""Why don't you ask your husband what his fantasy was!""

Although it's not immediately apparent what Hutchison's alleged ""fantasy"" actually entails, there isn't anything that isn't upsetting about this entire situation.

Stodden, who maintained that her mom's confession was ""the first time I've heard her say that,"" tied the knot with the ""Green Mile"" actor, who is 34 years her senior, in 2011 when she was only 16 years old. Keller consented to the legal union.

While the couple split for several months in 2013, they reconciled and renewed their vows the following year.

foxnews.com,2016-03-02 00:00:00,This chimp behavior is baffling scientists,[],"Chimpanzees in West Africa are throwing rocks at trees, and why they're doing it remains a mystery, Discovery reports. Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology say this chimp behavior has never before been documented and that it may shed some light on the species' cultural customsand even those of early humans.

The scientists involved in the study published in Scientific Reports note that with camera traps, they found four chimp populations that ""habitually bang and throw rocks against trees, or toss them into tree cavities,"" amassing the rocks in ""conspicuous"" piles.

The chimps are seen on camera picking up stones, then lobbing them at the trees while letting out a ""long-distance pant hoot vocalization."" It's been mostly males observed engaging in this behavior (and only in West Africa), though there have been some females and juvenile chimps that have also taken part.

And while chimps are known to use various tools for foraginga press release notes they'll wield sticks to get bugs or honey, or stone or wooden hammers to smash open nutsthat doesn't seem to be the case here.

""As the stone accumulation behavior does not seem to be linked to either the abundance of stones or the availability of suitable trees in an area, it is likely that it has some cultural elements,"" study co-author Christophe Boesch says.

Another co-author, Laura Kehoe, lists some possibilities for the Conversation: The loud behavior could be a (mostly) male display of some sort, or the rocks could be used as a ""signpost"" to mark paths or territories.

Or, Kehoe notes, they may be part of a ""sacred"" ritual. ""Indigenous West African people have stone collections at 'sacred' trees and such man-made stone collections are commonly observed across the world and look eerily similar to what we have discovered here,"" she writes.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Lead fear forces water ban in 30 New Jersey school buildings,[],"Elevated levels of lead caused officials in New Jersey's largest school district on Wednesday to shut off water fountains at 30 school buildings until more tests are conducted, officials said.

Newark Public Schools notified the state Department of Environmental Protection on Monday that annual testing found levels ranging from non-detected to above the Environmental Protection Agency's action level for lead, which is 15 parts per billion. That level requires additional testing, monitoring and remediation.

The DEP has requested test results from previous years to be able to do a complete analysis. No building had more than four samples above the action level, the DEP said in a statement.

The DEP confirmed lead has not been found in the city's water supply. ""In the vast majority of cases where lead is found in drinking water, it enters through the water delivery system itself when it leaches from either lead pipes, household fixtures containing lead or lead solder,"" the DEP said.

Notices have been posted and bottled water and water coolers have been delivered to the buildings in Newark.

Lead in drinking water has drawn increased attention recently because of the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, that happened after the city switched from the Detroit system to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure in 2014. Lead from aging pipes leached into the drinking water because it wasn't treated with anti-corrosion chemicals. Lead in school water is a longstanding issue in the United States and has been a focus of federal and local regulators.

""I understand in the Flint environment that any sign of elevation is going to make everyone go haywire, but here, the water system in Newark is still safe, it's still drinkable,"" Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said at an afternoon news conference. He also asked for cases of water to be donated to the schools.

Parents should have no concerns about their children's water and food consumption at school, the DEP said, because drinking water alone is not typically associated with elevated blood lead levels. ""It is the buildup of lead from all sources over time that determines whether harmful health effects will occur,"" the DEP said.

Parents who are concerned can have their children tested for lead at the Newark Health Department.

The state chapter of the Sierra Club environmental group called for more testing and pipe replacement.

""New Jersey cities have old outdated pipes in our streets and homes which can mean even higher levels of lead in our water. Many of our water systems go back to the Victorian era and even homes built in the 30's and 40's have pipes made with lead solder,"" said director Jeff Tittel.

Prosecutors say Tairod Pugh, 48, went to Turkey last year hoping to make his way to Syria to join ISIS.

Defense lawyers say the Neptune, New Jersey man didn't intend to find the terror group a month after he lost his job as an aviation mechanic. But prosecutors say Pugh was preparing to reject the country he had served in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990.

Pugh appeared calm while the verdict was read in the Brooklyn, N.Y. courtroom. He never took the stand during trial testimony.

He faces up to 35 years in prison on the charges of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and obstruction of justice.

Last week, an undercover FBI agent posing as an Islamic State sympathizer testified that he was wearing traditional Muslim religious clothing when he sat down next to Pugh at Kennedy Airport last year, in an area where people waited to be cleared to enter the United States after a trip abroad. He said Pugh told him he had been sent back to the U.S. from Egypt.

""On more than one occasion, he said he expected to be arrested,"" the Los Angeles-based agent said, recalling that Pugh seemed nervous whenever a law enforcement person passed by.

The agent testified that Pugh warmed up to him after seeing an Islamic State flag on his Facebook page. The agent said Pugh told him that if he went to Turkey, he should not look pious.

""He said: 'Shave the beard. Wear the pants.' He said the object is to blend in,"" the agent recalled.

At one point, the agent said, Pugh told him: ""Allah willing, the next time I travel as a tourist to the area, I'll wear a Yankees baseball cap.""

On cross examination, defense lawyer Eric Creizman established that his client never told the agent he had any contact with the Islamic State or any plans to go to Syria. Creizman also had the agent acknowledge that Pugh never said he wanted to wage jihad or become a martyr.

A judge set Pugh's sentencing for September.

Watch ""The O'Reilly Factor"" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET!

O'REILLY: Back to Fox segment tonight. How to solve the border mess.

Joining us from Washington, Senator Marco Rubio from Florida.

So Senator, top of the program we told the audience about polls that are coming in now on the border crisis. President Obama getting hammered. The vast majority of Americans think he is doing a terrible job there. However, just 23 percent of Americans believe the Republicans in Congress, of which you are one are doing a good job. 23 percent. So you guys are getting a blast as well. So my question to you is, if you were the president of the United States how would you stop this humanitarian disaster down there?

SEN. MARCO RUBIO (R) FLORIDA: Well, first of all, it wouldn't have happened because I never would have signed an executive order granting a deferred action to those who were in this country illegally. I think he was showing a tremendous amount of compassion, but that was not the right way to do it. It sent a message that actually invited people to come, and you see the disaster that has followed. The second thing, I would say, is that the first step in this process needs to be an all-out effort to finally put to rest the illegal immigration problem in America. And this involves the construction of strategic fencing, but also the deployment of specific technologies like ground sensors and cameras and drones and so forth to secure the southern border with Mexico. It involves a verify system, to require employers to verify that the people they are hiring are legally here. It involves an entry-exit tracking system, particularly at our airports, because 40 percent of our illegal immigration problem are people that enter the country legally and overstay visas. That would be the first step in this process, you have to do every single aspect of it, and only after you do that can you move to step two, which is reforming the legal immigration .

O'REILLY: And I agree with you 100 percent, you have got to stop - you've got to stop the madness first. But let's deal with the kids now because this is the humanitarian crisis the whole world is watching. Number one, you have no fence in these hot sectors, you say we should. And I agree. Number two, Governor Perry of Texas is asking and has asked for years, the National Guard to get down and help the border patrol. Do you favor that?

RUBIO: I do, and again, that has to do with manpower and that would be a part of any effort to secure the border.

O'REILLY: OK. So you put the guard down there, you show the world the pictures of our military on the border. Right away just those pictures then would de-incentivize the people who are paying these terrible cartels to human smuggle. So you would have a solution. All right, now, why do you think the folks are holding it against the Republicans -- are they believing President Obama when he is trying to blame you, guys, for the border madness?

RUBIO: I think it is an indictment of all of Washington, of the failure for more than a decade to deal with the problem that we know exists. Unless you are in favor of the status quo, unless you look at what is happening now and say, I think, this is working for America you have to be in favor of fixing it. So that is not really the debate, the debate is how do you fix it? And in my mind, the first step in fixing this, is to stop the growth and the problem that we have right now with illegal immigration, and then to begin to erode that number, to lower it, so that you can move to step two, which is reforming the legal immigration process towards one that is based on merit and works for our country in the 21ST century.

O'REILLY: OK, would you send the kids back?

RUBIO: Yes, and I'll tell you why that' important. Because the leading reason why this is happening, is word of mouth is spreading that if you make it to the United States as an unaccompanied minor or as a family with children you are going to be treated differently than adults who are traveling by themselves. And that word gets back, so imagine for a moment, if someone comes across the border, as a family or as an individual, they are now released into the population, with a notice to appear, but, of course, they never will, or do. And then what happens is, they call back home, people see they made the voyage safely, and you've now created a word of mouth incentive.

O'REILLY: Sure.

RUBIO: For others to do the same thing.

O'REILLY: All right, so you would send them back - you would get the increased courts, the judges down there to get them out, because that's going to be a big thing when that starts to happen. How many times have you spoken to President Obama personally about immigration reform?

RUBIO: Well, we've spoken a couple of times, but not in more than a year. And again, my conversations always begin with, what I've been saying publicly, and that is, anyone who is in favor of immigration reform must first be in favor of border security.

O'REILLY: And then how - what does he reply to that?

RUBIO: Well, I think they don't necessarily - well, two points - number one, the thing they'll say is the border has never been more secure, which is true for a handful of the sectors, but not for the others, not for the Rio Grande sector, not for the other sectors that we've seen, the Tucson sector of the border where people are crossing. And that has been the real challenge, is that the argument if you recall, he gave a speech in El Paso a few years ago where he mocked people who said we needed more border security by talking about how we would insist on a moat with alligators in it. And of course, now, we've seen that the border is in fact not secure.

O'REILLY: All right, Senator, we appreciate your time tonight, thank you.

The asphalt landing strip is in Area 6 of the Yucca Flat test site, about 12 miles northeast of the infamous Area 51 that has long been the subject of conspiracy theories. In Area 6, a handful of hangars with clamshell doors are clustered at one end of the airstrip, images from Google Earth reveal.

The area, which does not have a name, is fenced off and can be seen from the road by those touring the pockmarked Nevada National Security Site of Yucca Flat, where the military conducted hundreds of nuclear tests over several decades. [14 Strangest Sights on Google Earth]

While little is known about Area 6, the Yucca Airstrip is used by both the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security, Darwin Morgan, a spokesperson for the National Nuclear Security Administration, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

""They come here to test their own sensors,"" he recently said after evading questions from the newspaper about Area 6 for months.

Drone base?

Though officials with the government have been extremely reticent to reveal any details about the site, a few details have leaked out.

A 7,500-page tome on nuclear safety at the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste project includes a brief paragraph describing Area 6 as an ""aerial operations facility.""

The purpose of this facility is to construct, operate, and test a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles. Tests include, but are not limited to, airframe modifications, sensor operation, and onboard computer development. A small, manned chase plane is used to track the unmanned aerial vehicles, according to a 2008 report in the Yucca Mountain repository license application filed by government contractor Bechtel SAIC, which built the airstrip for $9.6 million.

The airspace above the strip is controlled, which reduces the risk of planes or satellites in space getting a detailed look at the surroundings. It also prevents the public from unintentionally stumbling upon the site, Morgan told the Review-Journal.

Based on its size, the hangars could house up to 15 MQ-9 Reaper planes, the type of drones used to perform reconnaissance, Tim Brown, an imagery analyst at the defense information website GlobalSecurity.org, told the Review Journal. The runway is too small for fighter jets or bombers, he added.

One possibility is that the remotely piloted planes do practice runs for reconnaissance work. Yucca Flat's high desert terrain echoes that found in the most remote regions of Libya, where Al Qaeda or ISIS operatives could be hiding out, he said.

If that's the case, the government may be testing out sensor arrays  essentially fields of hundreds of smartphone-type cameras that are mounted on planes such as the MQ-9 Reaper to take time-lapse photography. The idea is that anything out there that's moving could, in fact, be moved by a potential terrorist or bad actor, Brown said.

foxnews.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,North Korea reacts to UN's stern message. What's really going on?,[],"This week the UN Security Council imposed what it calls its broadest and deepest measures against North Korea in response to its January 6 nuclear test and February 7 missile launch, each of which were violations of earlier Security Council resolutions. And it appears these new sanctions were worth the wait. These are a tough and comprehensive mixture of punishment, pressure and persuasion sanctions that the global community has not applied until now with such clout and unity against the DPRK.

The North Korean regime responded hours later with a more active version of its usual bombast protesting UN action by firing six short-range projectiles off its eastern coast into the sea. Then it announced its nuclear weapons will be at the ready due to gangster sanctions which come from the world being duped by US hostility to North Korea. Nothing could make the new UN sanctions more relevant than this response from Pyongyang.

The multifaceted and complex Security Council resolution passed yesterday lays out the most far-reaching and coordinated sanctions measures  mandatory trade interdiction, a deeper arms embargo, financial sanctions, and bans on travel and luxury goods. The resolution includes new, unprecedented actions that are required to be taken by all UN member states. They are the strongest in closing off to Pyongyong a number of its lucrative currency moving and earning mechanisms that has permitted it to purchase both banned missile and proliferation material. And it closes loopholes and stifles some DPRK evasion techniques that have frustrated sanctions effectiveness in the past.

Specifically the resolution:

- Requires all nations to seize assets of North Korean governmental companies engaged in financing DPRK weapons proliferation and sanctions busting, and to deport all entities, like shell companies, and foreign nationals, including diplomats, that are engaged in proliferation financing and trade;

- Requires all nations to inspect the cargoes on all DPRK ships docking and airlines landing from or going to DPRK and to seize prohibited cargo;

- Imposes new sectoral sanctions, requiring all states to ban exporting aviation and rocket fuel to DPRK. Further, it restricts DPRK sale of gold, titanium ore, vanadium ore, and rare earth minerals, the latter being an area where DPRK is trying to attract large international private investment;

- Requires all nations to ban all weapons trade of any type. To cover loopholes, the resolution has a smart catch-all ban on all military material and related goods and there are new prohibitions to curtail the extensive training and arms manufacturing ventures the North has in begun with various nations;

- Cuts to the heart of DPRK evasion techniques in the past in its re-registering of ships under new names or flags of convenience and names directly 30+ vessels that must have their assets seized;

- Points out to DPRK that there is another path  engaging in the Six Party Talks.

This resolutions strategy is that with full international community action in a concerted way, backed by the Councils P5, to search and seize materials, to cut off DPRK classic evasion techniques of shadow financial systems and front companies, and to expel diplomats and businesses moving money and material, Pyongyongs elite will be forced to the bargaining table.

Now every port of call and airport will inspect DPRK bound or origin goods. The new restrictions of conventional military equipment and support systems are far-reaching and long overdue given that arms exports are a major source of revenue for DPRK and it can reverse engineer many imported items. And government and quasi- official agencies, North Korea's Ministry of Atomic Energy Industry and its National Aerospace Development Agency (NADA) which was responsible for February's rocket launch, and the rather secretive General Reconnaissance Bureau, are all sanctioned.

This complex resolution is the product of weeks of intense dialogue and negotiation between Beijing and Washington. It indicates the two capitals, via the Council, wanted to leave very little to misinterpretation in Pyongyong about strength of the measures imposed and the message it conveys. In worrying about sanctions enforcement, especially by China, skeptics continually claim that Beijing would rather obstruct sanctions than be a party to the destruction of the DPRK economy that would create political instability.

But these sanctions illustrate that there is solid ground between those two extremes - a dramatic increase in multi-sector constraints that now have the teeth to bite and possibly change the cost-benefit ratio facing Kim Jun-un in continuing his nuclear testing and missile launches which destabilize the region. In many ways these activities take pressure off of China. More vigorous enforcement by the region and now all member states can pre-empt or overcome some Chinese lax enforcement. If the sanctions work, there will be cargo and material that never reaches Chinese ports or Beijing airport. And China benefits from DPRK being constrained in the emerging rare earth minerals market.

Indeed, Beijing will be tested in enforcing aviation bans and on shutting down banking connections and financial houses which lubricate DPRK trade and their construction projects in African countries. But these outcomes will be known quickly and addressed in big power diplomacy.

These sanctions, in and by themselves, will not force DPRK to halt their program or curtail their intentions to be a nuclear player. But they will retard the pace of their nuclear - and especially their missile - programs, end much of DPRKs growing trade in arms material, cut-off more fully external collaborators and illicit networks that have helped the regime evade prior sanctions.

Significantly, government elites are hit from multiple angles that undercut their financial and political privileges. UN action condemns them for diverting precious state resources from care of North Koreans suffering hardships under its policies. The Council also states strongly its support for a resumption of the Six Party Talks as a way forward to resolve the differences between the world community and DPRK. Thus the sanctions are meant to focus DPRKs mind and newly constrained resources on diplomacy rather then continued defying international norms.

Newark Public Schools notified the state Department of Environmental Protection on Monday that annual testing found levels ranging from non-detected to above the Environmental Protection Agency's action level for lead, which is 15 parts per billion. That level requires additional testing, monitoring and remediation.

The DEP has requested test results from previous years to be able to do a complete analysis. No building had more than four samples above the action level, the DEP said in a statement.

The DEP confirmed lead has not been found in the city's water supply. ""In the vast majority of cases where lead is found in drinking water, it enters through the water delivery system itself when it leaches from either lead pipes, household fixtures containing lead or lead solder,"" the DEP said.

Notices have been posted and bottled water and water coolers have been delivered to the buildings in Newark.

Lead in drinking water has drawn increased attention recently because of the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, that happened after the city switched from the Detroit system to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure in 2014. Lead from aging pipes leached into the drinking water because it wasn't treated with anti-corrosion chemicals. Lead in school water is a longstanding issue in the United States and has been a focus of federal and local regulators.

""I understand in the Flint environment that any sign of elevation is going to make everyone go haywire, but here, the water system in Newark is still safe, it's still drinkable,"" Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said at an afternoon news conference. He also asked for cases of water to be donated to the schools.

Parents should have no concerns about their children's water and food consumption at school, the DEP said, because drinking water alone is not typically associated with elevated blood lead levels. ""It is the buildup of lead from all sources over time that determines whether harmful health effects will occur,"" the DEP said.

Parents who are concerned can have their children tested for lead at the Newark Health Department.

The state chapter of the Sierra Club environmental group called for more testing and pipe replacement.

""New Jersey cities have old outdated pipes in our streets and homes which can mean even higher levels of lead in our water. Many of our water systems go back to the Victorian era and even homes built in the 30's and 40's have pipes made with lead solder,"" said director Jeff Tittel.

It wasn't immediately clear why the plainclothes narcotics detective chose to stop a white Cadillac, Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Chief Tom Hackney said. The man who shot the officer had just threatened his girlfriend with a gun and was reported as being suicidal.

""It was bad luck that the officer encounters him immediately after this,"" Hackney said.

The detective, who is not being identified because he works undercover, was wearing a ""body armor"" style vest when he got out of his car to approach the suspect, Hackney said. The word ""police"" was marked clearly on the vest.

The driver immediately opened fire, Hackney said, hitting the detective in the head, upper body and hand. The detective was out of surgery Wednesday afternoon and in critical but ""more stable condition.""

The suspect, who has not yet been identified, ran away from the shooting scene and stole a large flatbed truck from a nearby business, Hackney said.

The detective, whose 14-year-old son was in the car but unharmed, managed to call for help.

The officers located the truck and pursued it into a nearby neighborhood, where it crashed into a house. The man ran into the backyard and two officers found the suspect holding a gun. They ordered him to drop it, Hackney said, and when he didn't, the suspect was shot four times. He survived and is in custody.

The officers who fired are on administrative leave.

It was unclear why the detective had his vest on while off duty. Hackney said narcotics detectives often carry their bullet-proof vests in the car with them because they can be called into work at any time.

foxnews.com,2016-02-25 00:00:00,Dinosaur was giving 'the finger' due to bone deformity,[],"A Jurassic-age dinosaur suffered from eight devastating maladies during its lifetime that likely caused the paleo-beast an enormous amount of pain and possibly made it difficult to hunt, a new study suggests.

The beast set a record for most upper-body injuries ever seen on a theropod dinosaur (a group of bipedal, mostly meat-eating dinosaurs), the researchers said. The previous record-holder is Sue, the famous Tyrannosaurus rex on display at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, who has a total of four bone injuries on its shoulder and forelimbs.

""We not only exceeded the record [for theropod injuries], we doubled it,"" said study co-author Phil Senter, a professor of biology at Fayetteville State University in North Carolina. [Photos: Dinosaur's Battle Wounds Preserved in Tyrannosaur Skull]

Researchers excavated the maimed dinosaur in Arizona in 1942, but nobody analyzed its injuries until recently. The first studies on the dinosaur simply identified its species (Dilophosaurus wetherilli), Senter said. The adult dinosaur measured about 20 feet (6 meters) long, and was found in a rock formation dating to between 190 million and 183 million years ago, he said.

But Senter did a double-take when he looked at D. wetherilli, now housed at the University of California's Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley. ""I found a fracture here, a fracture there,"" and soon he started a full-scale investigation into the dinosaur's maladies, he said.

There was plenty to investigate. The dinosaur has a healed fracture on its left shoulder blade and its left radius (the bone between the elbow and thumb).

""We don't know if both of those injuries happened at the same time or not,"" Senter told Live Science. ""I wouldn't be surprised if they did, though.""

D. wetherilli also had a serious bone infection on its left ulna, the bone between the elbow and pinkie, where ""a whole bunch of bone is just missing,"" Senter said. Unlike mammals, whose bone typically grows back after a severe bone infection, birds and reptiles cannot regrow bones. Theropods, the ancestors of birds, may have shared this trait, which may explain the missing bone cavity, Senter said.

There are two more injuries  likely more bone infections  on the dinosaurs' left thumb bones. In modern birds and reptiles, puncture wounds can cause bone infections, Senter said. Perhaps a puncture wound also led to D. wetherilli's missing bone, he said.

The dinosaur's right side is also damaged. D. wetherilli had three bony tumors on its right radius, possibly a malignant osteosarcoma, Senter said. Additionally, the right humerus (the bone from the shoulder to the elbow) is deformed, and would have stuck out to the side instead of being held under its chest, Senter said.

""It seems to have osteodysplasia, a condition where the bones are easily deformable,"" Senter said. ""It's got a similar problem on the third finger of its right hand, where the metacarpal bone and the first finger bone of that finger are both deformed, but they fit together perfectly. It doesn't look like they were injured, but they're just twisted into this mess.""

In fact, the third finger permanently stuck out, ""so it's constantly slipping everybody around it the bird,"" Senter said. ""It wasn't being rude. It couldn't help it."" [In Photos: Wacky Fossil Animals from Jurassic China]

Dino combat?

It's impossible to know what caused the dinosaur's injuries and whether they happened at the same time or throughout its life, Senter said.

""But, my favorite hypothesis was that it was facing off with a rival who kicked it in the left arm, hence the two puncture wounds, and in the process of the kick, slammed it into something, perhaps a rock wall, perhaps a tree, which explains the breaks,"" Senter said.

After that, its left side would have been injured in multiple places, which may have caused the dinosaur to favor its right side. ""And if you're favoring one side and you've got osteodysplasia, you're going to deform yourself,"" Senter said.

It's possible the dinosaur went hungry because of its injuries, especially if it was in pain and had trouble catching prey with fractured arm bones, Senter added.

""But this is conjecture, too. It's also possible that it went after smaller prey that it could get with its mouth,"" he said. ""One does what one has to.""

Cataloguing injuries such as these may help paleontologists learn more about theropod anatomy and body movement, said Thomas Carr, an associate professor of biology at Carthage College in Wisconsin, who was not involved in the study.

""I think it's important to do this sort of work so that we build up a big comparative database of lesions,"" Carr said. Such a database could show how various dinosaur species responded to injury, and whether some injuries are more common than others, he said.

For instance, forelimb fractures are common in theropods, and some paleontologists have taken this to indicate that they used their forelimbs very vigorously, Senter said.

The study was published online Feb. 24 in the journal PLOS ONE.

foxnews.com,2016-02-22 00:00:00,Giant dinosaur had 2 tumors on its tailbone,[],"It's fairly common to discover dinosaur remains scratched with ancient claw or bite marks, but finding fossils with signs of tumors is rare.

And now scientists have found not one but two different types of tumor on the same bone  the vertebra of a titanosaur, a gigantic long-necked, long-tailed paleo beast, a new study finds.

""Finding any disease in fossils is rare,"" said the study's lead researcher, Fernando Barbosa, a doctoral student of geology at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. ""Cancer still is most rare because the majority of them do not leave signals in bones."" [Gory Guts: Photos of a T. Rex Autopsy]

The finding is the first known case of a tumor in a dinosaur that isn't a duck-billed dinosaur, or hadrosaur, the researchers said.

The 7-inch-long fossilized vertebra, discovered in 2012 in Brazil's southern Sao Paulo state, belongs to a species in the Titanosauridae family, ""the most abundant Cretaceous dinosaur family of South America,"" the researchers wrote in the study.

However, the 90-million-year-old bone had an unusual appearance  a ""small bony button-shaped protuberance,"" the researchers wrote in the study. Curious, Barbosa and his colleagues decided to investigate the weird bump, which measured just 0.3 by 0.3 inches.

They found evidence of two tumors, both benign, Barbosa said. One is an osteoma, a bone overgrowth, which the researchers confirmed with a computer tomography (CT) scan and an examination of the fossil's structure.

The other, a hemangioma, is a harmless vascular tumor.

""We were very lucky finding this because we didn't have any evidence of the hemangioma,"" Barbosa told Live Science in an email. ""It was diagnosed by [the CT scan], which was only possible because we were investigating the radiological appearance of the osteoma.""

The tumors, though examples of abnormal cell growth, should not be called cancer, he said. Usually, only harmful tumors are called cancer, and these tumors were benign, Barbosa said. Furthermore, because of the tumors' location and likely small sizes, the dinosaur probably didn't notice them, the researchers said.

It's not the first ancient animal to have an osteoma, the researchers said. The oldest known case of osteoma dates to the early Carboniferous (a period spanning 359.2 million to 299 million years ago) in the North American fish Phanerosteon mirabile. The mosasaur Platecarpus, a marine reptile, also had an osteoma, as did a crocodile, Leidyosuchus formidabilis, which lived during the Paleocene, a period spanning between 65 million and 56 million years ago.

The new finding shows that dinosaurs other than hadrosaurs developed tumors, Barbosa said. For instance, Brachylophosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, Bactrosaurus and Edmontosaurus, all duck-billed dinosaurs, show evidence of hemangiomas, just like the titanosaur does. Various individuals from the genus Edmontosaurus also showed evidence of a desmoplastic fibroma (a rare bone tumor), an osteoblastoma (bone cancer) and a metastatic cancer (cancer that spreads throughout the body).

""We still need to find several other diseases in dinosaurs [and] other extinct animals, and understand why they were affected by them,"" Barbosa said.

The study will be published in the July issue of the journal Cretaceous Research.

""It is not surprising that moderate-intensity physical activity is protective against cardiovascular disease mortality,"" said lead author Dafna Merom of the University of Western Sydney in Australia.

""I actually was surprised that light-intensity dancing was not protective; I would expect that if the benefits of dance can be attributed to the social and affective aspect of dancing than I would expect light-intensity dancing to be beneficial,"" Merom told Reuters Health by email.

Merom and her colleagues pooled 11 population surveys form the U.K. between 1995 and 2007, including more than 48,000 adults age 40 and older with no heart disease at baseline.

The surveys included questions about frequency, duration and intensity of dancing and walking over the previous four weeks. These answers were linked to the National Death Registry.

Only about 3,100 of the 48,000 people surveyed reported dancing of any intensity. Two-thirds of the group said they walked at any intensity.

People who danced tended to be younger, have a lower body mass index, were less likely to have long-standing illnesses and got more overall physical activity than non-dancers.

During follow-up, there were 1,714 deaths due to cardiovascular disease. People who reported moderate intensity dancing and walking were less likely to die from cardiovascular disease than those who did not, even after accounting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, chronic illness, psychosocial distress and total physical activity, as reported online now in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.

The minimum recommended amount of moderate-intensity activity is 150 minutes a week, but this pooled analysis did not include a direct measurement of how much people were dancing, Merom said.

""I would advise for those who find walking somewhat boring or those that like to challenge themselves to try dancing,"" she said. ""First, you can reach higher intensity than in walking while dancing, it may be for short intervals but this all adds up, and you get some of the benefits associated with vigorous-intensity physical activity.""

""But dance is also hard on the brain, as it is a highly coordinated activity and requires skills and learning,"" she said.

All styles of dance tend to have slow or quick tempo options, and the quicker the better for heart health, Merom said.

""A large body of literature over 60 plus years shows that energy expenditure from physical activity reduces risk of cardiovascular disease,"" said Dr. I-Min Lee of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, who was not part of the study. ""We now increasingly realize that how this energy is expended - from walking, biking, swimming, dancing, playing with children, etc. - doesn't matter, so long as it is moderate in intensity.""

""I think what is important is that we need to stick with being physically active - and to do so, one must do what one likes,"" Lee told Reuters Health by email. ""So if you like to dance, great! If you don't and prefer to walk - then walk.""",[]

People with anxiety may not be able to distinguish between neutral and threatening stimuli as well as individuals without this mental health condition.

In a small study researchers designed a sound experiment to explore the brains plasticity or its ability to change and respond to new situations. These changes influence how the brain reacts to stimuli and whether the person is able to distinguish between safe or dangerous circumstances.

Researchers said the study suggests that people with anxiety cannot discriminate between stimuli that have an emotional content and similar mundane or daily stimuli. That might explain the anxious response that they exhibit to scenarios that seem regular, normal or non emotional to anyone else.

They cautioned that the study is small and more research involving more people is still needed to understand how or whether anxiety may directly cause shifts in how people perceive the world around them.

The North's Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried photos on its front page showing Kim and nuclear scientists standing beside what outside analysts say appears to be a model warhead part -- a small, silverish globe with a ballistic missile or a model ballistic missile in the background.

The newspaper said Kim met his nuclear scientists for a briefing on the status of their work and declared he was greatly pleased that warheads had been standardized and miniaturized for use on ballistic missiles.

Information from secretive, authoritarian North Korea is often impossible to confirm and the country's state media have a history of photo manipulations. But it was the first time the North has publicly displayed its purported nuclear designs, though it remains unclear whether the country has functioning warheads of that size or is simply trying to develop one.

This also would be the first time Kim has been quoted directly about the miniaturized warheads.

""The nuclear warheads have been standardized to be fit for ballistic missiles by miniaturizing them,"" state media agency KCNA quoted Kim as saying as he inspected a nuclear facility.

""This can be called true nuclear deterrent,"" he added.

On Monday at State of Air Force briefing at Pentagon, the Air Force's top officer Gen. Mark Welsh told Fox News, that while the actions of North Korea are ""very worrisome,"" the country does not have the capability to put a nuclear warhead on top of a missile and shoot it at the United States.

North Korea warned Monday of pre-emptive nuclear strikes after the United States and South Korea began holding their biggest ever war games.

Tensions remain high after North Korea's recent nuclear test and rocket launch, which prompted the United Nations to adopt tough new sanctions.

Ellenhorn accused liberal students of engaging in a witch hunt and committing institutionalized discrimination against me and my views.

If you voice a difference of opinion on any small issue  they lash out at you, he told me. Youre a racist, youre a homophobe, youre anti-woman, youre sexist. This is ridiculous.

The official complaint, first reported by Campus Reform, alleges that Ellenhorn created a hostile environments (sic) for our USC study body, and has also violated our USC Principles of Community by bringing a speaker and moderating an event that blatantly perpetuates sexism.

The Lefties were especially troubled when Ellenhorn invited Milo Yiannopoulos to speak last year.

PODCAST: Listen to Todds indepth interview with Jacob Ellenhorn

Stephen Smith, an adjunct professor and executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation, accused Yiannopoulos of being known for his anti-feminist and more broadly misogynist commentary.

Harmful speech has no place in the Trojan community, Smith wrote in a letter calling for Yiannopoulos to be disinvited.

Whatever Yiannopoulos has to say on campus, his invitation here calls into question the human values as well as the academic standards of the USC College republicans, he wrote. Controversial celebrity presenters may draw an audience, but the integrity of the USC College Republicans is rubbished by such content, the high standards of excellence we all try to uphold at USC are undermined, and the USC community as a whole is deeply offended on behalf of its women students, staff and faculty.

Ellenhorn admits that hes invited firebrand speakers like Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro.

They are claiming that because I invited them  I made students on campus feel unsafe, he said. No one has to listen to them. No one was forced to attend. For goodness sake  were adults. We should be able to handle other peoples opinions.

Senators are expected to hold hearings later this month to determine the young conservatives fate. But Ellenhorn doesnt seem to be all that intimidated.

He penned a fiery response to the complaint  accusing University Student Government of trying to castrate strong male voices into submission.

Bold.

Now, you might be wondering why Im dedicating this column to covering what some might consider a silly campus skirmish. But this is no silly skirmish.

Pew Research did a study a few months ago  revealing that 40 percent of millennials believe there should be limitations on free speech. Thats a disturbing number.

I suspect that our public universities are being used to foster such anti-American thinking. The Left isnt just opposing dissenting viewpoints. They are trying to silence opposing viewpoints.

Ellenhorn told me hes seen his fellow senators rant about all sorts of outrageous issues  but hes never tried to silence anyone. Hes never tried to have his opposition impeached.

Difference of opinion should be triumphed, he said. But what they are trying to do is shut difference of opinion down.

And they are in for a mighty big fight.

Im not going to stand down, he said. Im going to stand up. Im not going to be quiet.

Well said, Jacob! Thats exactly what you should do when faced with a leftwing bully. Stand your ground.

They are trying to silence me  and Im just going to get louder.

He cant afford $100, let alone $28 million, Michael David Barretts father, Francis, said at his Portland, Ore., home Tuesday. If he could, he wouldnt be living in my basement.

The jury decided Monday Andrews should be awarded nearly $55 million for the video he made at a Nashville hotel, which is liable for $26.75 million.

The broke Barrett is well aware he screwed up his life, the dad said.

Its an awful thing, and he knows it, Francis Barrett said.

The convicted peeper, who spent 212 years in prison for stalking Andrews, typically goes to work as a truck driver at a meat packing plant in Portland every day, but on Tuesday he hid out in his dads basement.

Barrett, 54, was released from federal prison in 2012, and filed for bankruptcy the same year, listing $3,000 in assets, including clothing, golf clubs and a 1995 Toyota Avalon, records show. He was $159,891 in debt.

It remains to be seen how much Andrews will be able to collect.

Manhattan lawyer Susan Karten said theres no question the Nashville Marriott will appeal  and the appellate court could cap the damages.

Most likely theres going to be nothing there [from Barrett], said Karten, who has no connection to the case. You can always garnish a salary with a judgment, but how much could that be?

Meanwhile, one of the jurors, Terry Applegate, told The Post, We needed to come to a figure that would impact Erins situation and her eight years of dealing with this, as well as impact the hotel itself and the hotel industry so that they recognize the severity of what occurred.

Crews were responding to reports of a natural gas leak when the explosion occurred along a main thoroughfare north of downtown, Seattle Fire Department spokeswoman Corey Orvold said.

The cause was under investigation. There were no reports of any other injuries or anyone missing. Dogs were being used to go through the rubble just in case.

Video surveillance from the Olive and Grape Mediterranean Restaurant showed a bright flash at 1:43 a.m. and then the room shakes as debris falls from the ceiling. A large garage door covering the restaurant's front windows protected it from extensive damage.

""The Olive and Grape was lucky,"" owner Paola Kossack told The Associated Press in an email.

Bike shop owner Davey Oil said he arrived soon after the fire trucks.

""There were tons of flames leaping over what was already the rubble of Neptune coffee, which as you can see now totaled, gone,"" he said.

Crews were still dousing an active flame with foam as the Greenwood neighborhood awakened.

Residents were checking out the damage along with the rubble and glass that littered the streets. Workers from one cafe damaged in the blast poured coffee for firefighters.

Among the businesses damaged or destroyed were Neptune Coffee, Mr. Gyro and the bike shop G&O Family Cyclery. An apartment building and another nearby residential structure were evacuated.

""Our block is a pretty close-knit block and this is pretty terrible,"" Oil said.

Chocolati Cafe manager Darla Weidman said she was relieved the blast occurred overnight instead of 11 a.m. when the shop sometimes is packed with people.

""I know neighbors will do everything they can to support these businesses as they begin the long and challenging task to recover and repair from this incident,"" Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said in a statement. ""The city will also be there to do what we can.""

Puget Sound Energy spokeswoman Akiko Oda said gas service for the impacted buildings was shut off about an hour after the blast and the shutdown was later expanded.

The utility said it completed leak surveys for the block around the area and no leaks were found.

Oda says it will take time to determine what caused the explosion and the utility will be working with the Seattle Fire Department in the investigation.

Pipeline safety investigators from the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission were also on site.

Harborview Medical Center spokeswoman Susan Gregg said eight firefighters and a battalion chief were treated at the facility. None of the eight men and one woman was admitted to the hospital.

""We didn't have anybody with burns, nothing life-threatening, nothing major"" said Gregg, adding that some firefighters were checked out because the blast was so powerful that it pushed them back.",[]

These personal care products, including makeup, perfume, hair products and sunscreen, are made with chemicals such as phthalates, parabens, triclosan and oxybenzone, which have been shown to disrupt the bodys endocrince system, Medical Daily reported. These disruptions can cause hormone imbalances and neurobehavorial problems, obesity, diabetes and cancer.

Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, sought to study how long these chemicals remain in the body. Working with a local health clinic, they asked a group of 100 girls to stop using their personal care products for three days, Medical Daily reported.

""Teen girls may be at particular risk since it's a time of rapid reproductive development, and research has suggested that they use more personal care products per day than the average adult woman, lead study author Kim Harley said in a press release.

The team found that the product break led to a significant decrease in levels of the endocrine-disrupting chemicals. In urine samples taken before and after the trial, they observed a 45 percent decrease in propyl parabens (found in cosmetics), 44 percent decrease in methyl parabens (found in cosmetics), 36 percent drop in benzophenone-3 (found in sunscreen) and triclosan (found in antibacterial soaps), and a 27 percent drop in diethyl phthalate (found in perfume).

Researchers noted that they observed a small increase in two less common parabens, likely due to potential ingredient substitution or accidental contamination. While this may indicate the need to investigate the purity of chemical-free products, overall the study shows the clear need to avoid typical personal care products, they added.

""One of the goals of our study was to create awareness among the participants of the chemicals found in everyday products, to help make people more conscious about what they're using,"" said Maritza Cardenas, one of the studys teen researchers who is now an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley. ""Seeing the drop in chemical levels after just three days shows that simple actions can be taken, such as choosing products with fewer chemicals, and make a difference.""",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-02 00:00:00,"GOP being turned inside-out by primary battle, Hill leaders caught in the chaos",['Chad Pergram'],"Theres a scene in the science fiction/comedy film Galaxy Quest where the crew is desperate to rescue Tim Allens character from the surface of an alien planet. You see, a gigantic creature called a pig-lizard is about to maul Allen while the crew watches in horror from the spaceship in orbit.

The crew wants to beam Allen back to the ship. Problem is, theyve never tested the transporter device which dices someone into a million pixels during transit. So the crew tests the transporter on the pig-lizard instead.

This doesnt work out too well. They beam the pig-lizard aboard the ship. But it arrives ... inside out. And then the pig-lizard explodes, all over the transporter deck, innards and gizzards and plasma everywhere.

This macabre scene may well describe the state of the Republican Party after Super Tuesday. An inside-out, ruptured pig-lizard, strewn about a spaceship. It is ugly. But this is the GOPs reality.

Not only is Donald Trumps bid for the nomination soaring against all early expectations, but the phenomenon could hold consequences for the congressional contests.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., for his part, worries about retaining the majority part in his title. So McConnell must help incumbent Republican senators in swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Illinois retain their seats. The Kentucky Republican reportedly vowed that his party would drop [Trump] like a hot rock this fall.

But so far, most Republicans are freaking out about what they can do to save their own hide at the ballot box in November, with the possibility of being caught up in a fight involving Trumps base and its foes.

This problem is especially acute when so many congressional Republicans publicly backed Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who has now won only Minnesota. Others still support Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. But the worst news for the GOP from Super Tuesday? Everyone did just well enough to keep running. No ones dropping out. That further muddles things. Cruz and Rubio could keep running to build a firewall thats just thick enough to deny Trump from mathematically securing the GOP nomination. That could prompt a brokered convention in Cleveland this July.

Talk about an exploded, inside out, pig-lizard.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., repeatedly talks about the presidential sweepstakes in his prepared remarks at press conferences. Ryan speaks about how the stakes are so high this fall. The consequences are so grave. Yet Ryan chatters about the presidential race without directly addressing the presidential race.

Ryan usually says something like this:

I've also said 100 times I'm not going to comment on what's up and what's down in the day-to-day of the presidential election contest, proclaims the Wisconsin Republican. He adds that Ive said 100 times we're going to be able to work with whoever our nominee is. We're going to be able to present a unified front.

But Ryan periodically deviates from this purported agnosticism. He did so last fall when he upbraided Trump for comments about Muslims. Ryan again chastised Trump this week.

When I see something that runs counter to who we are as a party and a country, I will speak up, said Ryan.

Trumps initial refusal to disavow white supremacist David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan (something he has since done) is what forced Ryans hand this time.

If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games. They must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry. This party does not prey on peoples prejudices, said the speaker.

McConnell echoed Ryan.

Senate Republicans condemn David Duke and the KKK in the strongest terms possible, said McConnell.

Democrats barely react to this as the GOP seemingly ruptures from the inside.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., tells CBS that the GOP should put its weight behind Cruz, because, well, even the Texas Republican is better than Trump.

This is the same Cruz who engineered the 2013 government shutdown, called McConnell a liar on the Senate floor and repeatedly claims that the nation is governed by the Washington cartel.

There is consternation about what Trump or Cruz means down-ballot for Republicans. The Senate was already in play before all of this. Democrats must collect a net gain of 30 seats to reclaim the House. Thats a tall order. Multiple sources say Democrats could inch into the high twenties for seats they flip if Trump is the Republican standard-bearer  but still falling short. Winning the House entails a significant suppression of the GOP vote across the board. That puts otherwise safe Republican House seats in play.

But the real trouble could be the future of the party. This may be the moment where the fractured GOP finally splits. After all, Republicans have only secured a majority in a national election once since 1988.

The bigger question is what becomes of the Republican Party  let alone, how its members govern.

For now, its ugly.

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,"Like Flint, water in California's Central Valley unsafe, causing health problems",['Rebekah Sager'],"While the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, made headlines around the country when the city's leaders exposed residents to a tainted water supply for almost two years, families living in the Central Valley of California have been struggling without clean drinking water for decades.

The population of the Central Valley, a basin surrounded by mountains that once offered hope to migrants like the fictional Joads in the The Grapes of Wrath, today is about 80 percent Latino, and 92 percent of the migrant farm workers in the Valley are Latino.

There are vast dairy farms reeking of manure, highways lined with fast-food restaurants, liquor stores, prisons and numerous dialysis centers.

Much of fruits and vegetables consumed in the U.S. are grown here, and the soil has been decimated by agricultural activity  overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, manure from livestock. One result is a toxic soup of nitrates in the area's drinking water.

Residents in towns along the San Joaquin Valley rely predominantly on pumps and ground water  which is not effectively regulated for contamination.

When pumped up into peoples homes, the nitrates are so dangerous that people are known to get rashes when they shower. The presence of nitrates in the water supply also has been linked to blue baby syndrome, which is caused by the decreased ability of blood to carry oxygen  one of the most common causes is nitrate in drinking water.

People turn to buying five gallon jugs to shower with and using 300-gallon tanks of non-potable water for basic needs.

Generations of people who live here know not to drink the water, Susana De Anda, a clean-water advocate and the co-executive director and co-founder of the Community Water Center NGO, told Fox News Latino.

People pay more for this toxic water  sometimes as much as $100 a month for water just to shower with. On top of that theyre paying for drinking water, De Anda said.

According to the Environmental Justice Coalition for Clean Water, rural Central Valley communities pay the highest drinking water rates in the state, with some families shelling out as much as 2 to 6 percent of their income for water that they cant drink.

According to a Pacific Institute report, nitrate exposure's health impacts in the Central Valley fall disproportionately on poor Latino communities.

Due to the states severe drought, new wells have to be dug more deeply, demand is high and the cost is between $1 million and $2 million dollars.

""The drought actually causes the pollutants in the soil to be more concentrated and levels of contaminants such as nitrates to rise. Also, when deeper wells are dug, and that would be by maybe wealthier farmers, they actually end up syphoning water away from poor communities,"" Genoveva Islas  program director at Cultiva la Salud (""Cultivate Health""), a non-profit health advocacy organization in the Central Valley  told Fox News Latino. ""And it creates a real inequity.""

Most people in the area live a large distance from the closest big grocery store. Liquor and convenience stores become the default place to buy food and produce, and, all too often, sugary drinks are less expensive than drinking water.

""Were in a food desert. People would buy water in bulk, but big stores are often very far outside of communities, and so families make a tough trade-off. Soda might be more affordable, De Anda said.

In addition to other factors, the consumption of soda vs. water is one of the leading reasons for the severe health problems in the Valley. The region has big problems with obesity and the highest rate of Type 2 diabetes in the state.

An analysis of state's death records by the Fresno Bee and the Center for California Health Care Journalism at the University of Southern California paints a vivid picture of the disproportionate toll diabetes has taken in the Valley.

At least 19 people die from diabetes-related complications in the eight San Joaquin Valley counties every day, the highest rate in the state.

""I've lived here all my life, and not until I was an adult was really aware of dialysis clinics. Now, I have an aunt and a close family friend who are both on dialysis. I'm seeing a number of these [places] pop up. More than ever before,"" Islas says.

The Central Valley may be the fruit and veggie center of the country, but for poor people healthy food is still significantly more costly than food sold in bulk, such as beans, rice, tortillas, white bread, ground beef and large bottles of soda. Many of the stores in the Valley offer free soda with groceries, and a small bottle of water runs about $1.69 versus a large soda at .99 cents.

In the last three years, the state has paid to retrofit water filters on drinking fountains in some pockets of schools and daycare centers, and provided filtered bottle stations, where people can fill-up containers. But Islas says it's not universal.

""There's still a lot of marketing of sugary drinks to kids, which in addition to diabetes and obesity, dental health problems. In Flint, the Governor has set aside money for the kids impacted by the lead, but in the Central Valley, we have the same issues of long term health problems for impoverished kids. We use education as a pathway out, but if you're thirsty or you have health concerns, it's pretty hard to learn,"" Islas says.

The drought in California may be shining a light on the region and its water supply, but the issues in the Valley have been left largely unaddressed.

All these are interim solutions, but we also need to create water awareness. The water may look clean, but that doesnt make it safe. It shouldnt matter who you are or where you live, clean drinking water is a basic human right, De Anda says.

Britney Spears is the cover girl for V Magazines 100th issue. Why? Because only a Living Legend could.

When looking for cover-worthy subjects for our 100th issue, we had to ask ourselves: Who do pop stars and musicians  who have become an integral part of what V represents  look up to and admire? There was only one answer: Britney....[W]ho in our world did not grow up listening to her music? V editor Stephen Gan explains, featuring the unbelievably gorgeous covers of the upcoming double issue. (So fire hot  a twenty out of ten is an actual understatement.)

Plus, shes spent some time out of the ether, which makes her reappearance all the more fun and surprising. Mario Testinos pictures say it all: shes in great shape, and about to hit us with new music any day now.

Translation? B9 is coming sooner rather than later, yall.

On her upcoming album: Honestly, Im just particular with this record. Its my baby, and so I really want it done right. I would much rather have it be completely how I want it to be, whether that takes another year for me to do, or two months. I have no idea at this point. But I just know that the direction Im going in is so good. Its the best thing Ive done in a long time. Im proud of the work, and its very different; its not what you would think at all. But Im not rushing anything. I just want it to be done right, so that my fans will truly appreciate it.

On not being into technology: Honestly, I still dont use my computer. My kids use the computer more than I do! I understand that a lot of people are into it, and I have days where I write and stuff, but its really not for me. Its not my thing.

On haters: Whoever is in the spotlight, people are really quick to judge. I mean, there are a lot of kids coming up whove experienced that. You know, Justin Bieber, hes huge, and he experiences that. Its just the way the world works, unfortunately. Ive been doing this for 20 years. I kind of dont pay attention to it. I have my relationship with God and myself and thats what matters to me. I really dont care what most people think.

UPDATE: The full cover story is now available to read on V.

Writer John Norris penned the cover story for the centennial issue  her first cover for V Magazine since Spring 2011 (also shot by Testino), in which she declared the bitch is back and better than ever.

The issue is out on March 8, and according to WWD, will include a mini-retrospective in the first volume of the magazine, featuring contributions from the likes of everyone from Mert & Marcus to Lady Gaga.

Pre-order the issue at V, where you can also stare at the three covers in glorious high quality. Mr. Photographer, I think shes ready for her close up.

Two people have drowned in Oklahoma and Texas, and the rain is expected to stay in the forecast for much of the week.



A flash flood warning is in effect for parts of eastern Texas, southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana, and forecasters said some of the areas could see damaging winds and isolated tornadoes on Wednesday as well. Flash flooding was expected from the Texas Gulf Coast to southern Illinois, with the heaviest rain likely to fall in southeast Texas and the Ozark and Ouachita mountains of Arkansas, the National Weather Service said.



In rural southeastern Oklahoma, a 30-year-old man drowned Tuesday night after trying to drive his SUV across a low-crossing bridge that was covered by floodwaters. In Texas, a 22-year-old man drowned Monday night after his canoe capsized in Dickinson Bayou, southeast of Houston near Galveston Bay.



Up to 7 inches of rain was expected through Wednesday and up to 12 inches by the end of the weekend along the Texas-Louisiana border and central Arkansas. Flash flood watches have been issued Wednesday for areas from Port O'Connor, Texas, to near Springfield, Illinois.



Some flooding was reported late Tuesday in northwestern Louisiana between Shreveport and Minden, with up to 80 homes and a nursing home being evacuated. No injuries have been reported.

Bernie Sanders 62 percent to 32 percent among likely Democratic primary voters, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Wednesday.

Secretary Hillary Clinton has doubled-up on Sen. Bernie Sanders in Florida, Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll said, adding that it is difficult to see a path to victory for Sanders in the Sunshine State. He has just too much ground to make up and not enough time in which to do it.

The poll has Clinton pulling ahead in Ohio, 52 percent to 43 percent  but Brown believes there is still a long shot chance of Sanders gaining ground in Ohios winner-take-all primary.

Secretary Clintons advantage is impressive, but nowhere as large as the 30 percent point lead she has in Florida, Brown said.

In both Florida and Ohio, the number of undecided voters is smaller than Clintons lead, meaning that in order to secure a win, Sanders would have to take all of the undecided voters and then chip away at Clintons core backers.

The fact that there is no meaningful difference between the two candidates supporters when it comes to professed loyalty to their candidate contributes to Sen. Sanders problems, Brown said.

On Tuesday, Sanders scored a surprise upset over Clinton in hard-fought Michigan. The win gives Sanders a chance to renew his momentum heading into next weeks high-stakes matchups.

However, mathematically, trying to catch up to Clinton will be difficult. He will have to win three-fifths of the remaining delegates to break even with Clinton.",[]

Newark Public Schools notified the state Department of Environmental Protection on Monday that annual testing found levels ranging from non-detected to above the Environmental Protection Agency's action level for lead, which is 15 parts per billion. That level requires additional testing, monitoring and remediation.

The DEP has requested test results from previous years to be able to do a complete analysis. No building had more than four samples above the action level, the DEP said in a statement.

The DEP confirmed lead has not been found in the city's water supply. ""In the vast majority of cases where lead is found in drinking water, it enters through the water delivery system itself when it leaches from either lead pipes, household fixtures containing lead or lead solder,"" the DEP said.

Notices have been posted and bottled water and water coolers have been delivered to the buildings in Newark.

Lead in drinking water has drawn increased attention recently because of the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, that happened after the city switched from the Detroit system to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure in 2014. Lead from aging pipes leached into the drinking water because it wasn't treated with anti-corrosion chemicals. Lead in school water is a longstanding issue in the United States and has been a focus of federal and local regulators.

""I understand in the Flint environment that any sign of elevation is going to make everyone go haywire, but here, the water system in Newark is still safe, it's still drinkable,"" Newark Mayor Ras Baraka said at an afternoon news conference. He also asked for cases of water to be donated to the schools.

Parents should have no concerns about their children's water and food consumption at school, the DEP said, because drinking water alone is not typically associated with elevated blood lead levels. ""It is the buildup of lead from all sources over time that determines whether harmful health effects will occur,"" the DEP said.

Parents who are concerned can have their children tested for lead at the Newark Health Department.

The state chapter of the Sierra Club environmental group called for more testing and pipe replacement.

""New Jersey cities have old outdated pipes in our streets and homes which can mean even higher levels of lead in our water. Many of our water systems go back to the Victorian era and even homes built in the 30's and 40's have pipes made with lead solder,"" said director Jeff Tittel.

If the individuals were indeed Muslim, these graves would be the earliest Muslim burials on record in France, the researchers said. [Images of a Medieval Mass Burial in Paris]

""It's a new insight on the knowledge of settlement of French territory,"" said study co-lead researcher Yves Gleize, an archaeologist and anthropologist at the French National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research and the University of Bordeaux. ""I hope that, in the future, we'll find other Muslim burials to [help pinpoint] the Muslim occupation in the south of France.""

Gleize and his colleagues found the graveyard during an excavation of a Roman quarter in Nimes, in southern France. (The excavation took place before a parking lot was built over the area, Gleize said.) As time went on, they found about 20 scattered graves; the lack of any order suggested that these bodies weren't buried in a cemetery, he said.

""We knew that during the early Middle Ages in France, there were a lot of scattered graves in [the] countryside,"" Gleize told Live Science in an email. ""But I was very surprised when I looked at the position of the skeleton in three of these graves.""

During the Middle Ages, the Arab-Islamic conquest led to significant political and cultural changes around the Mediterranean. There is evidence that Muslims lived on the Iberian Peninsula during early medieval times, but there is less evidence of them north of the Pyrenees, the mountain range that separates Spain from the rest of mainland Europe, the researchers said.

Gleize knew of Muslim graves at Montpellier and Marseille dating to the 12th and 13th centuries, respectively. But radiocarbon dating showed that the newfound graves are even older, dating to between the seventh and ninth centuries, he said.

Historical records indicate that there was a Muslim presence in France during the early Middle Ages, during the eighth century, so the dates for these graves make sense, he said.

Grave research

After discovering the graves, Gleize and his colleagues studied the funerary practices, analyzed the individuals' DNA and determined their sex and approximate ages.

The analyses indicated that the men  adults ranging from about 30 to older than 50 years old  were Muslim, Gleize said. The bodies (buried on their right sides) and faces (which are oriented southeast) point toward Mecca. Moreover, the burial pits are socket-shaped, a design feature common among Muslim graves, he said.

An analysis of the DNA and mitochondrial DNA (genetic material passed down through the maternal line) showed that these men likely descended from, or were related to, people who lived in North Africa. [8 Grisly Archaeological Discoveries]

These clues suggest that the three men were Berbers, a group of North Africans who integrated with the Arab religion and armies during the early Middle Ages. It's likely these men were part of the Umayyad army, the force that conquered southwest Europe beginning in the eighth century, the researchers said.

""For the moment, we cannot assert that they were born in North Africa, but their presence in [the] south of France is surely linked with the presence of Berbers in the Arab army,"" Gleize said.

Though the graves suggest that Muslims lived in southern France during the Middle Ages, Gleize said he and his colleagues ""don't know about the type of contact [they had] with the local population,"" he said. ""[But] one of the skeletons was surely more than 50 years old,"" he added. ""It's possible that he lived several years at Nimes before he died.""

The findings were detailed online Feb. 24 in the journal PLOS ONE.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Many athletes used Sharapova drug meldonium during 2015 European Games, study finds",[],"The use of meldonium - the banned drug taken by Russian tennis champion Maria Sharapova - was widespread among elite athletes competing at the European Games in Baku last year, according to research in the British Journal of Sports Medicine (BJSM).

The study, based on information volunteered by athletes and individual medical teams, and on laboratory data from doping tests from the Games in Azerbaijan, suggested up to 490 athletes may have been taking the drug during the competition.

The findings showed that during the Baku Games, 13 medallists or competition winners were taking meldonium, 66 athletes tested positive for it, and they said meldonium was detected in athletes competing in 15 of the 21 sports in the competition.

""This study highlights the widespread and inappropriate use and prescribing of this prescription drug in a generally healthy athlete population,"" said the researchers, led by Klaus Steinbach and Christian Schneider of the European Olympic Committees Medical and Anti-Doping Commission.

Some 6,000 athletes took part in the Games, the first major multi-sports event for the continent, with qualification spots on offer for August's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

The BJSM said the research, published online on Wednesday, had been shared with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and had contributed to its decision to ban use of meldonium in competitive sport as of Jan. 1 this year.

Sharapova tested positive for meldonium, also known by the brand name Mildronate, in a sample taken on Jan. 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter-final defeat to Serena Williams.

She told a news conference her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year-old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation said.

Meldonium is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks , which told Reuters the drug could protect athletes from cell damage, but would be unlikely to improve their competitive performance.

The BJSM study said, however, that ""the drug is evidently being used with the intention to either improve recovery or enhance performance - (and) use of a substance with the intention to improve performance is, by WADA's definition, a violation of the spirit of sport"".

Mildronate is registered for sale in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, but does not have a license from either the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the EU's European Medicines Agency.

Steinbach and Schneider said since the samples and data from laboratories were ""blinded"" of all personal and demographic details, they could not say which specific countries the athletes who tested positive for meldonium came from.

Athletes' self-reported declarations of meldonium use suggested there is higher use in countries where the drug is registered and prescribed then in countries where meldonium is not registered for medical use, they said.

They added, however, that ""athletes and healthcare providers from any country where the drug is not officially registered for medical use could easily obtain the drug through medicines importation and exportation routes, and even more easily through online purchases"".",[]

Curse or not, a group of documentary filmmakers has begun poking around in unprecedented fashion. The crew from UK's Channel 4 became the first to gain permission to examine Shakespeare's grave at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon earlier this year, reports the Telegraph, though they're using radar rather than shovels.

The results of their study, part of commemorations marking the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, will be revealed in a documentary this spring. ""We can confirm a scan of the grave has been completed,"" says a church rep.

If nothing else, the work ""is likely to give a clearer picture of a possible family vault,"" reports the Telegraph, adding that the playwright is buried next to his wife, daughter, son-in law, and grandson-in-law.

It's also possible the study could put to rest a long-standing rumor, as noted by the Stratford Observer: ""There has been historical speculation as to whether Shakespeares skull was removed by grave robbers and re-buried outside of his home town."" But a Jezebel blogger isn't banking on bombshells: ""Educated guess: Spiders, bones, and possibly an ill-advised earring."" (Could this be the famous skull?.)

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Dropout drama: Are the media pushing Marco Rubio to get out?,['Howard Kurtz'],"The Republican primary contest has become the great dropout derby.

The media are obsessed with whos getting out, and when, and some are giving the reluctant candidates a nudge.

Nowhere was this more evident than in the confrontation between the Marco Rubio campaign and CNN.

The network reported, according to sources, that a battle was raging within the Rubio campaign over whether the senator should drop out before next Tuesdays Florida primary, which Donald Trump is leading in the polls.

In the report, Jamie Gangel quoted a source familiar with the discussions as saying that Rubio doesnt want to get killed in his home state, and that a poor showing would be a risk and hurt his political future.

Alex Conant, Rubios communications director, told me yesterday that he was blindsided by the story. I called everyone I knew over there and said, what is this? They didnt even reach out for comment before going on air, and its utterly false.

Conant told me he called several people at CNN, hopped in a taxi and went to the Washington bureau, where he went on the air with Wolf Blitzer and called the report fiction.

Conant says he was later bumped from a previously scheduled appearance with Anderson Cooper that eveningbumped so late that he was in a car outside the Capitol Hill bureau, waiting to see if he could get on.

Gangel, while noting Conants denial, told viewers that we double-checked with our source who confirmed that our story was 100 percent correct.

CNN says in a statement that there were multiple sources for the story, not one. But the network had a responsibility to ask the Rubio folks for comment before airing such a potentially damaging story.

The thing about unnamed advisers is that they could be part of a campaigns innermost circle or outside kibitzers who check in once in awhile. But CNN is confident that its sources are sufficiently high-level and genuinely concerned about Rubio's future. What's more, it hasn't escaped anyone's notice that the Rubio campaign is fundraising off the incident.

And the impact of such stories is amplified by the hundreds of outlets that pick it up, in this case on the day before the voting in Michigan and three other states. For people to wake up and see the banner of Drudge with a false report is not helpful, Conant told me.

Meanwhile, some Cruz supporters in Hawaii got e-mails or saw social media posts about Rubio and the CNN report, reminiscent of the Cruz camp jumping the gun in Iowa about Ben Carson possibly quitting, prompting an apology from the senator. In this case, a campaign statement said that these actions were not sanctioned by the Cruz for President campaign but were done by some volunteers. The campaign said these people have been contacted and told to remove the material.

Theres a larger issue here, and it has to do with the media drumbeat for whether a candidatewhich can become so loud that it drowns out the persons message and hastens the process.

The Jeb Bush death watch became such a prominent feature of his coverage that it seemed almost anti-climactic when he quit on the night of the South Carolina primary.

Rubios situation isnt as dire, but naturally his poor performance in the last several contests has given rise to such talkespecially with Ted Cruz suggesting his Senate colleague consider dropping out and Donald Trump urging Rubio to do so.

And this takes on heightened importance because of the GOPs stop-Trump movement. If Rubio wins Florida, where hes trailing Trump by 8 points in the latest poll, he can probably stay in the race. The same goes for John Kasich with Ohio. And that would probably deny Trump the 1,237 delegates he needs to win this thing before Cleveland.

But if Rubio cant win his home state, his campaign is almost definitely over, and his political career might be jeopardized as well.

So what he does in the next week is a legitimate story. But in fairness to Rubio, the media need to give him a chance to make his case, and not just hound him over why hes still in the race.

So heres a novel suggestion: Why dont we let the voters decide?

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Could Trump win over some black voters?,['Joseph Weber'],"Contest after contest has shown Hillary Clinton has the overwhelming support of black voters in the 2016 Democratic primary  but up against Donald Trump, the general election might be a different story.

To be sure, nobody expects Trump or any GOP presidential candidate to win the majority of the black vote, which has been with Democrats since the mid-1930s. Clinton has every reason to believe most black voters sticking with her in the primary against Bernie Sanders would do so in a general election as well.

However, analysts suggest that to consider the black vote a monolith for Clinton in November, should she win the nomination, would be a mistake. The Trump jobs message that has attracted so many disaffected white, blue-collar workers could resonate with black voters equally frustrated by chronic unemployment and unfulfilled promises of change  and Trumps accelerating march toward the GOP nomination has proven his knack for bringing in voters who might not normally pick a Republican.

If anything, he knows the economy, Luz Nelson, a beautician and black South Carolina voter, said days before the front-running Clinton won the state Democratic primary with more than 80 percent of the black vote.

Im a New Yorker, too, Nelson continued. I know where hes coming from. Nobody controls Donald Trump.

If he wants to put any significant portion of the black vote in play, Trump would have to do better than past GOP nominees -- if he indeed is his partys standard-bearer come November.

Then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney got just 6 percent in 2012. John McCain got even less, 4 percent, in 2008 against Barack Obama, who became the countrys first black president. Republican President Gerald Ford won the highest percentage of the black vote in modern history -- 16 percent -- but still lost to Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter.

Influential black political commentator Tavis Smiley recently cautioned Democrats that Trumps appeal could cross not only party but racial lines.

If Donald Trump is indeed the Republican nominee, it might be a miscalculation for Democrats to take for granted that black voters are a lock for their nominee, even with [Bill Clinton] and Barack Obama campaigning for her, Smiley wrote in a USA Today op-ed.

There is no reason to believe that if he is his partys nominee, Donald Trump wouldnt make a serious play for black voters. Who knows how many he might skim? In a close election, it might not take much.

Clinton has since South Carolina in early February continued winning the black vote in large numbers across the South. She did so again in the Mississippi primary Tuesday night, though Sanders upset victory in Michigan all but eclipsed that success.

Meanwhile, she has secured a long list of influential African-American endorsements, from actor Morgan Freeman to civil rights icon Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis, while the front-running Trump appears to be struggling to make grassroots connections.

Online videos appear to show Black Lives Matters activists protesting and disrupting recent rallies, as Trump can be heard in the background of one event telling security to throw them out.

And critics say he failed during a recent national TV appearance to unequivocally disavow support from former Klu Klux Klan leader David Duke  though Trump has since disavowed it, and downplayed the controversy.

Democratic and Republican strategists seem to agree, though, that the billionaire businessman Trump  charisma, bravado and all  has at least captured the interest and curiosity of black voters.

Up until the KKK thing, he had been doing pretty well, Douglas Smith, a Democratic strategist and partner at Kent Strategies, said Tuesday. He oozes this appearance that everybody can fly in a gold jet and have a mansion. I think its his signature charisma.

Smith nevertheless suspects Trump will ultimately come up short because he doesnt have the deep well of support with the black community like Clinton has -- built over the course of roughly 40 years of public service.

And he says Trump lacks the ground game and the kind of party support that would coalesce around Clinton or Sanders.

You just cant add water, Smith said.

Republican strategist Rob Burgess thinks some of Trumps appeal is indeed in policy, specifically his health care proposals.

I will not let people die on the streets for lack of health care, he roared in a debate last month.

However, Burgess thinks other black voters believe Trump will indeed boost the economy for American workers and added, He can sway some black voters ... due to his charisma.

The Trump campaign declined to comment on efforts to connect with black voters.

However, the campaign has occasionally used two black women  the Stump for Trump Girls -- as a warmup act on the trail and whose performances have become an Internet sensation.

If we continue to vote left, we are going to get left, the duo said at Trumps military veterans fundraiser last month in Iowa. And when we look at Donald J. Trump, he has us in mind. He wants a secure boarder. He wants to bring jobs back. He wants to make sure our veterans are taken care of. ... And thats why baby we are going to stump for Donald J. Trump.

The Rev. Issac Holt, senior pastor at the Royal Missionary Baptist Church, in North Charleston, S.C.  who was visited by both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns  thinks the wild card for Trump or any other GOP nominee is the energy they are bringing to the race. But they need to get into the communities.

Whats missing is the enthusiasm, he said. In South Carolina, they didnt even seek the black vote, in my opinion.",[]

The former UNC defensive lineman, who was unable to get his life on track after a promising college football career, died last November homeless and dependent on drugs and alcohol. He once told NYT reporter Juliet Macur, ""Something is wrong with my brain.""

On Friday, researchers at Boston University and the Concussion Legacy Foundation confirmed a brain analysis showed evidence of CTE, Hoffman's family confirmed to Macur.

For the Hoffmans, it was the answer to the mystery of Ryan Hoffman's continuing problems, which included jail time and joblessness -- troubles that defined his life after a successful college career on a team ranked in the top 10.

""I wanted to know exactly what happened to my brother, and I just knew football did it,"" his sister, Kira Soto, told me Monday in a phone call as she began to cry. ""I've been looking into this for 15 years and defended him when people said it was just the drugs and judged him for something he couldn't help, something that he struggled with. Well, we know now. We know.""

In a March 2015 profile of Hoffman, Macur wrote of a football standout who said he started noticing something wasn't right in his head in his last year at school.

Hoffman recalled having only one concussion, during his junior year, but couldn't remember the details. He said he might have had others, too, but never complained because he feared losing his starting position.

He never thought about the possible consequences. Yet by his final season, Hoffman said, he noticed that his mind had begun to warp, and that antisocial thoughts -- punching strangers, drinking and driving -- had begun to creep in.

The symptoms got worse after college, and Hoffman was unable to hold on to a job, and his marriage ended in divorce. Last year, Macur found him panhandling and plagued with short-term memory problems.

""It's my brain that keeps me from being a productive member of society. I'm physically very strong, but I'm mentally so weak. Something is wrong with me. I don't know what it is, but I used to be normal, you know?"" Hoffman said at the time.

""I'm confident -- well, I'm pretty sure -- that football had something to do with it.""

Now more than ever, companies are tapping into the social consciousness of todays shoppers, primarily the largest and most diverse generation, millennials. More than eight in 10 millennials (81 percent) expect companies to make a public commitment to good corporate citizenship, according to Horizon Medias Finger on the Pulse study.

This new business norm has motivated some women to launch ventures that combine social impact with their passion for advancing women issues such as equality, education and career opportunities. Here are three companies founded by women committed to changing the lives of women:

1. Cora is redefining the way women experience their period, offering a line of feminine accessories and 100 percent organic cotton tampons by subscription. The purchase of one months supply turns into the donation of a months supply of feminine products to girls in developing countries. Approximately 100 million girls miss school because they lack the products they need during their period, and Cora is seeking to fill that gap around the world. During the week of International Womens Day, Cora will be doubling its donation to girls for every new subscription.

2. Co-founded by Latina power duo Catalina Girald and Golden Globe winning actress Gina Rodriguez, the company Naja is bringing hope and opportunity through lingerie. They have created a brand that seeks to empower women instead of objectifying them, while also providing fashion-focused, environmentally friendly lingerie to women. Najas garment factory primarily employs single mothers or female heads of households where they are paid above market wages with healthcare benefits.

3. Same Sky was born with a mission to help women who survived the brutal genocide in Rwanda, which left over a quarter of a million victims of rape, and 70 percent of them contracted HIV/ AIDS. The company offers beautiful bracelets and accessories made by many of these women in Rwanda. They earn 15 to 20 times the average wage in Sub Saharan Africa, while Same Sky reinvests 100 percent of its net proceeds to train and employ more artisans in need.

So next time you are wondering how to make an impact, consider products and companies that not only are good for your looks and body but also do good for other women. Happy International Womens Day!

After a meeting of its emergency committee on Tuesday, the U.N. health agency also said there is increasing evidence that a spike in disturbing birth defects and neurological problems are caused by Zika, which is mostly spread by mosquito bites. When WHO declared the explosive outbreak in the Americas to be a global emergency last month, it said that the evidence that Zika was responsible was only circumstantial.

WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said ""reports and investigations in several countries strongly suggest that sexual transmission of the virus is more common than previously assumed."" The U.S. is investigating more than a dozen possible cases of Zika in people who may have been infected through sex.

Chan also said nine countries have now reported increasing cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare condition that can cause temporary paralysis and death. She said that problems linked to Zika, including Guillain-Barre syndrome, are now being seen not just in women of child-bearing age, but children, teenagers and older adults.

Zika is also now spreading to new countries, WHO said. It noted local transmission has now been reported in 31 countries across Latin America and the Caribbean.

""All of this news is alarming,"" Chan said.

Despite the lack of definitive evidence proving that Zika causes birth defects and neurological problems, Chan said officials shouldn't wait for definitive scientific proof before making recommendations.

""Microcephaly is now only one of several documented birth abnormalities associated with Zika infection during pregnancy,"" she said, adding that it can cause growth problems, injuries to the central nervous system and fetal death.

WHO's emergency committee called for ""intensified"" research into the relationship between new clusters of babies born with abnormally small heads and other neurological disorders. It said particular attention should be given to studying the genetics of the different Zika virus strains and establishing studies to determine if there is a causal relationship.

So far, cases of babies born with small, deformed heads linked to Zika have only been confirmed in Brazil and French Polynesia, though officials say they expect reports from other countries once the virus has been circulating there long enough to affect pregnant women. Colombia has reported several suspected cases of microcephaly.

""Women who are pregnant in affected countries or travel to these countries are understandably deeply worried,"" Chan said.

WHO recommends pregnant women avoid travel to areas with ongoing Zika outbreaks and that if their partners travel to affected countries, they should practice safe sex or abstain from sex for the duration of their pregnancy.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,NY City unveils flashy new high-tech buses,[],"If you're a public transportation user in NY City who prefers to stay overground than underground when getting around, then the experience is about to become a whole lot more comfortable.

The city announced Tuesday it's to introduce 2,000 ""state-of-the-art"" buses, with the first ones rolling onto the streets in April.

The $1.3 billion investment means many of the city's two million daily bus users will be able to access on-board Wi-Fi and make use of USB ports for charging phones and other mobile devices. Each of the new vehicles will have between 35 and 55 of the power-giving ports depending on the vehicle's make and model, and will be ""conveniently located"" throughout the bus.

The vehicles will also feature electronic signboards offering travelers up-to-the-minute information about their journey, including upcoming stops and available transfers.

""Today's world demands connectivity, and we're meeting that challenge with state-of-the-art buses and a major overhaul of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's fleet,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said, adding that the upgrade will create ""a stronger, more convenient and more connected mass transit system for years to come.""

The high-tech buses, which will have ""a distinct new look and feel"" (make your own mind up by checking out the the images), are set to replace about 40 percent of the MTA's current fleet, with all of the new vehicles going into service by 2020.

Commenting on the investment, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Internet access has become ""a necessity, not a privilege, and from charging ports to Wi-Fi, this new MTA fleet will provide critical tech services that New Yorkers depend on each day.""",[]

A family eats their lunch inside their shack just outside the Socialist City of Hugo Chavez, in Valencia, Venezuela.

Jonatan Martinez, a taxi driver, cleans his car outside of his apartment in the Socialist City of Hugo Chavez.

Resident Jose Manzanares looks out his government-assigned home, in the Socialist City of Hugo Chavez.ap

Drive down a road lined with trash fires, past an improvised slum where sewage runs between shacks and through an army checkpoint, and you'll reach a startling destination: a gleaming, self-contained community about as clean and orderly as a U.S. suburb.

Welcome to the Socialist City of Hugo Chavez, a utopian community of 15,000 in the middle of one of the world's most economically ravaged countries.

A flagship of the socialist revolution founded by its namesake, the late president, Chavez City is a happy place, boasting free clinics, schools, sports centers, community gardens, an arts center and a school supplies dispensary, all of them plastered with renderings of Chavez in his signature red beret.

But in a sign of how profoundly Chavez's revolution is struggling, the tranquil days in this worker's paradise may be numbered. Venezuela can't find the dollars to pay for vitally needed goods languishing in its ports, much less afford the largesse that funded Chavez City and other marquee projects that dramatically improved life for Venezuelans once trapped in isolated slums.

For now, residents still go about their daily routines with sleepy smiles, enjoying not only free housing, but other perks ranging from state-organized block parties to subsidized taxi rides.

""This must be one of the most beautiful cities in the whole world,"" said Dallana Alvarado, who works in the schools here and sometimes goes months between visits to the outside world.

High-ranking officials trailed by state television cameras visit these buildings as often as repairmen.

""The marvelous dream of our Commander Chavez is alive and well here; his theories have become a reality,"" President Nicolas Maduro said as he drove a bus through the coastal city last year.

Each of the identical squat 144 stucco-and-brick blocks seems to hum with activity. Barbers-in-training gave out free haircuts on a recent weekday as neighbors strung decorations across the courtyard. Excited 3-year-olds in matching red shirts troop into the sun-drenched preschools every morning, where they learn the basics of reading and are served hot meals.

The city is special in another way, too: Ninety-five percent of voters here supported the socialists in legislative elections last December. That's more than double what the party was able to muster nationwide as Venezuelans punished Maduro for a collapsing economy marked by widespread shortages and triple-digit inflation, as well as soaring crime rates.

The newly ascendant opposition, having previously shown little interest in programs for the poor, has vowed to outshine the socialists on their home turf.

After winning a congressional election for first time in 17 years, the opposition is floating as one of its first proposals an initiative that would give public housing residents something that even Chavez denied them: titles to their homes, allowing them to sell and accumulate capital.

Julio Borges, the opposition congressman pushing that proposal, said it would allow the poor to save for their future and stand on their own, ""ensuring we are a nation of citizens, not slaves.""

Grappling with a housing shortage of more than 2 million units, the government says it has built a million new homes, many in ""socialist cities"" of which Chavez City is just the largest. Some, built by China, Belarus and other allies, are riddled with infrastructure problems and crime, while others seem to be functioning.

While Chavez City residents don't see themselves as beholden to the government, they aren't exactly climbing into the middle class. Many say they love the city because it allowed them to give up the house cleaning or street vendor jobs they hated. The smooth roads and ample parking lots are empty, as few people can afford cars.

""I'm catching up on 25 years of rest,"" said Yomilady Segovia, who dropped out of fourth grade to help support her family and spent the next two decades selling coffee and empanadas in a municipal slaughterhouse.

When she got to Chavez City, her favorite thing to do was look out the window at the rain. She and her eight siblings grew up on the banks of a river that would periodically overflow and send them scrambling for safety in higher ground as it washed away their shacks.

""I still can't get over the idea of having to open the blinds to check the weather,"" she said.

Like many residents, Segovia is used to plenty of attention from weekly reality-TV segments that give hope to those still struggling in the slums.

When she was selected to move to Chavez City, the governor delivered the news himself, surprising her on camera as she drank her morning coffee. He personally carried her young son into her new, completely furnished apartment. A year later, she still cries recalling the joy of that day

The government, she is certain, will find a way to keep the outside tumult from threatening her life here.

""Chavez City is my future and my children's future,"" she said.

But the economic chaos engulfing the country is beginning to intrude. Teachers say residents of a nearby shantytown broke in and stole all the toilet handles from the cultural center, presumably to sell for scrap metal; children who come to sing folk songs with a staff of Cuban teachers can no longer use the bathroom there.

People from surrounding communities have begun to make hours-long trips to buy goods like coffee, milk and cooking oil for less than a penny each at the Chavez City supermarket, which does not suffer from the long lines and empty shelves of most state-run groceries.

And the checkpoint at the city gates has seen waves of protests as everyone from the construction workers who built the development to young mothers who can't afford soaring rents in nearby cities clamor for a spot inside. Even the principals and doctors who work here are looking for a way in.

Some of the angriest petitioners are right on the other side of the city fence, living amid piles of trash and swarms of mosquitoes as they wait for their homes.

The government has been trying for months to demolish their decade-old slum, only to have residents rebuild their shacks overnight from the rubble the government bulldozers leave behind.

Maryorie Celis, 33, lay with her two sons on muddy cots on a sweltering day as her neighbors picked what they could from the rubble left by the bulldozers.

As usual, the talk was of the brilliant white development next door. Some here have lost patience, and say in hushed tones that they voted for the opposition for the first time this December.

But many are still telling their children they'll soon be spending their days in the new playgrounds next door.

""We watched them build it for four years, full of hope,"" Celis said, clutching a certificate from 2014 showing that she'd completed a civic responsibility course required for residents of public housing. ""I know my keys are waiting for me.""

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,GOP sues State Department over access to Clinton emails,[],"Republican senators pressed for more information Wednesday about an FBI investigation into the potential mishandling of sensitive information that passed through former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's private email server, and their party sued for copies of the messages.

The Republican National Committee filed two lawsuits in U.S. District Court in Washington over access to electronic messages sent or received by the Democratic presidential candidate and her top aides during her time as the nation's top diplomat.

Both spring from Freedom of Information Act requests filed last year seeking copies of emails and text messages. In court filings, the GOP says it has not received any documents in response to the requests.

The GOP litigation brings the total to at least 34 civil suits so far involving requests for federal records related to Clinton's service as secretary of state between 2009 and 2013. The Associated Press is among those with a pending case at the Washington courthouse.

""For too long the State Department has undermined the public and the media's legitimate right to records under the Freedom of Information Act, and it's time it complies with the law,"" said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.

The State Department has released more than 52,000 pages of Clinton's work-related emails, but her private lawyers have withheld thousands more that they deemed to be personal communications unrelated to her job. Also left unresolved are questions about how Clinton and her closest aides handled classified information.

The AP Press last year discovered Clinton's use of the private email server, which had been set up in the basement of Clinton's New York home by former State Department staffer Bryan Pagliano, for her to use exclusively for her work-related emails while she was secretary.

The FBI for months has investigated whether sensitive information that flowed through Clinton's email server was mishandled. The State Department has acknowledged that some emails included classified information, including at the top-secret level. Clinton has said she never sent or received anything that was marked classified at the time.

The inspectors general at the State Department and for U.S. intelligence agencies are separately investigating whether rules or laws were broken.

Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Attorney General Lynch on Wednesday about media reports that the Justice Department had offered Pagliano immunity from criminal prosecution in exchange for his cooperation. Pagliano previously declined to testify before Congress, citing his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, the committee chairman, asked Lynch whether Pagliano's immunity offer carried over to congressional committees. Grassley, R-Iowa, wants to recall Pagliano to testify if he has received immunity.

Lynch declined to answer the question.

""We don't go into details with the agreements that we have with any witness on any matter in ongoing investigations,"" the attorney general said.

""The consistency with which the department handles ongoing matters, whether they involve a famous last name (or not), is something that we take very seriously,"" Lynch said. ""We treat them the same, and that is how the public takes confidence in the investigations we conduct.""

Lynch also said she had not discussed the email investigation with anyone at the White House and did not plan to do so.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,US Air Force vet found guilty of trying to join ISIS,[],"A federal jury on Wednesday found an Air Force veteran guilty of trying to join the Islamic State, in one of the first U.S. terror trials involving suspected ISIS ties.

Prosecutors say Tairod Pugh, 48, went to Turkey last year hoping to make his way to Syria to join ISIS.

Defense lawyers say the Neptune, New Jersey man didn't intend to find the terror group a month after he lost his job as an aviation mechanic. But prosecutors say Pugh was preparing to reject the country he had served in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990.

Pugh appeared calm while the verdict was read in the Brooklyn, N.Y. courtroom. He never took the stand during trial testimony.

He faces up to 35 years in prison on the charges of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and obstruction of justice.

Last week, an undercover FBI agent posing as an Islamic State sympathizer testified that he was wearing traditional Muslim religious clothing when he sat down next to Pugh at Kennedy Airport last year, in an area where people waited to be cleared to enter the United States after a trip abroad. He said Pugh told him he had been sent back to the U.S. from Egypt.

""On more than one occasion, he said he expected to be arrested,"" the Los Angeles-based agent said, recalling that Pugh seemed nervous whenever a law enforcement person passed by.

The agent testified that Pugh warmed up to him after seeing an Islamic State flag on his Facebook page. The agent said Pugh told him that if he went to Turkey, he should not look pious.

""He said: 'Shave the beard. Wear the pants.' He said the object is to blend in,"" the agent recalled.

At one point, the agent said, Pugh told him: ""Allah willing, the next time I travel as a tourist to the area, I'll wear a Yankees baseball cap.""

On cross examination, defense lawyer Eric Creizman established that his client never told the agent he had any contact with the Islamic State or any plans to go to Syria. Creizman also had the agent acknowledge that Pugh never said he wanted to wage jihad or become a martyr.

A judge set Pugh's sentencing for September.

When youre traveling, every second spent in traffic can be better spent working on a tan or a bottomless tropical drink. Here are a few beaches that are conveniently located less than half an hour from major airports.

1. Playa de Isla Verde, Puerto Rico

(Puerto Rico Tourism Company)

Less than five miles from San Juans Luis Munoz Marin International Airport (SJU), Playa de Isla Verde is the first place travelers can work on their tan upon arriving in Puerto Rico. The 1.5-mile-long crescent-shaped stretch of sand is popular with locals who come for sunbathing, paddle boarding, snorkeling and swimming. Families like this beach because the drop-off is gradual and the waves are gentle. As far as municipal beaches go, its hard to find one as clean as Playa de Isla Verde, which translates into green island. Green also has another meaning here: cash. Beachfront hotels like Courtyard Isla Verde Beach Resort and the Ritz-Carlton San Juan boast hundreds of slot machines, so guests and visitors can gamble when it rains.

2. South Beach, Florida

(Hyatt Centric South Beach Miami)

Long layovers at Miami International Airport (MIA) need not be spent in overpriced airport bars, because tropical drinks are only a 20-minute cab ride away at happening South Beach bars like DECK Sixteen, on the roof of the brand-new Hyatt Centric. South Beach is famous for its celebrity-studded clubbing scene, and at only a quarter per ride the local Miami Beach buses make nightlife transportation easy and affordable. During the day, the welcoming stretch of sand is the ideal place for people-watching. (That nondescript jogger on Ocean Drive Promenade just might be an A-lister.) And when youve had enough sun, South Beachs historic and iconic art deco buildings offer plenty of shade.

3. Virginia Beach

(Virginia Beach Convention & Visitors Bureau)

Virginias No. 1 visitor attraction, Virginia Beach, is a 20-minute drive from Norfolk International Airport (ORF). While certain parts of the beach are packed (especially during Beach Street U.S.A. concerts and festivals), Virginia Beach comprises 14 miles of sand  all offering free access  so its never hard to find space for your beach towel. More active, year-round activities include whale-watching excursions, horseback riding on the beach and bird-watching in the national wildlife refuge. For adrenaline junkies, theres swinging on the Skyscraper ride at the Amusement Park or climbing canopies in the aerial forest park at the Aquariums Adventure Center. Remember to save some time to visit the Military Aviation Museum and Fighter Factory when you return to the airport.

4. Culebra Bay, Costa Rica

(Playa Papagayo - El Mangroove)

Breathtakingly beautiful Culebra Bay, just 12 miles from Liberia International Airport (LIR), is a convenient escape for those who want to stay in the Guanacaste region, nicknamed Costa Ricas Gold Coast, without a rental car. The tranquil bay has several stunning white sand beaches  crowds and pesky vendors dont exist here  backed by mangrove forests. Guests at beachfront properties like El Mangroove can rent kayaks or paddleboards and beach-hop until they reach the northern part of the bay, where the water is as clear as glass and the coral community lends itself to brilliant and rather animated snorkeling. The bay is also a popular launching point for fishing trips and sunset cruises that take travelers into the Gulf of Papagayo.

5. Venice Beach, California

(California Travel and Tourism Commission, Andreas Hub)

With characters as entertaining as any youll find at Disneyland, Los Angeles Venice Beach is a must-see for visitors to sunny Southern California. The 2.5-mile-long boardwalk is only five miles northwest of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), a $40, 15-minute cab ride or an $18, 25-minute shared shuttle ride away. Once at the beach, visitors can get their hands greasy with fried foods galore or chalk up and compete with the boardwalks resident bodybuilders. The craziness of Venice Beach is what draws the masses  it has more than 16 million visitors a year  so its smart to book a room away from the chaos. The Ritz-Carlton Marina del Rey is within walking distance, but it also offers bike rentals so guests can pedal to the boardwalk.

6. Hermosa Beach. California

(Hermosa Beach Chamber of Commerce and Vistors Bureau)

Just 10 minutes from LAX is Hermosa Beach, a quieter, more affluent answer to Venice Beach. Beach volleyball is as routine as brushing teeth here, and its worth it to join a pickup game and play with the good-looking locals, even if youre in town only for a few hours. Hermosa Beach also offers excellent surfing; the Hermosa Beach Pier is home to the Surfers Walk of Fame. Although its primarily a residential area, the Beach House Hotel Hermosa Beach is located right on the 26-mile oceanfront paved path running up to Malibu, and 80 percent of its 96 guest suites offer sunset views.

7. Zona Hotelera, Cancun, Mexico

(CasaMagna Marriott Cancun)

If not for the time spent waiting for bags and immigration, travelers could arrive at Cancun International Airport (CUN) and have their feet in the sand within 20 minutes. Only 10.5 miles from the airport, CasaMagna Marriott Resort rises up from the picture-perfect white sand at the midpoint of the 12-mile-long Zona Hotelera. Since all of Mexicos beaches are federally owned; there are 10 public access points in Zona Hotelera, making it easy for travelers to reach the beach without having to book a room at one of the fancy resorts lining the strip. This stretch of sand is a magnet for spring breakers, but putting up with party-hungry college kids is a small price to pay for enjoying such a fine slice of paradise.

8. Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina

(Wilmington and Beaches CVB)

Billed as North Carolinas most accessible beach, Wrightsville Beach is a no-brainer for beach-minded travelers to the Tar Heel State. A bridge links the picturesque island community to the mainland and the city of Wilmington  a destination in itself. Wilmington International Airport (ILM) is just 10 miles away, so travelers can be paddle boarding along the Intracoastal Waterway or bodysurfing in the Atlantic less than 30 minutes after they touch down. This coastline is also a world-class diving destination. After launching from Wrightsville Beach, divers can explore more than 200 historic shipwrecks. During the winter months, when the water is too cold for swimming, visitors can rent kayaks and paddle to Masonboro, an undeveloped barrier island thats home to an array of seabirds and nesting loggerhead and green sea turtles.

9. Loreto Islands, Cabo San Lucas, Mexico

(James Tiffany Photography)

Intended to be the original Cabo, its surprising that Loreto has managed to stay true to its sleepy fishing village roots. Often referred to as Mexicos best-kept secret, the Loreto Islands lie just off the shore of the Loreto International Airport (LTO). The five major islands are anchored in the Sea of Cortez, home to Mexicos largest marine preserve. The regions premier resort, Villa del Palmar, offers boat excursions that allow visitors to tour the islands and interact with more than 800 species of marine life, ranging from mating Pacific gray whales to tasty yellowfin tuna and curious sea lions. Baja is home to some pretty outstanding beaches, and theres no better or more convenient place to enjoy them in peace and quiet.

10. Rockaway Beach, New York

(Julienne Schaer)

New York Citys Rockaway Beach isnt for the faint of heart, but it fits in perfectly in the city of extremes. The Atlantic-facing beach gets crowded in the summer, and the water temperature hovers near freezing in the winter. Still, the sandy shore is a sight for sore eyes in the concrete jungle, and its only a 20-minute taxi ride from John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). You can also get to Rockaway Beach via AirTrain and subway, but the $7.75 trip takes twice as long. At the beach, surfing (with wetsuits of course) reigns supreme. A-Team Paddleboarding offers rentals and lessons as well as SUP & Stay packages that feature floating campsites made out of roof panels and repurposed truck caps.

With the equivalent of 762 horsepower in the Model S P90D and a 0 to 60 mph time of just 2.8 seconds, few supercars could even match the electric sedan's performance.

But what about top speed? That's been a tough nut to crack for electric vehicle manufacturers because while instant torque helps an EV rocket off the line, all that ""electric juice"" runs thin as the runway gets longer. That's where Genovation Cars comes in.

The EV tuner took a 2006 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and turned it into the ""Genovation eXtreme Electric,"" or GXE for short. While testing the reborn 'vette at the Johnny Bohmer Proving Grounds/Shuttle Landing Facility in Florida, Genovation brought the sports car to a top speed of 186.8 mph. While even the regular Corvette can manage that feat these days, in the world of street-legal EVs, that figure is massive. In fact, it was nearly 10 mph quicker than the previous record holder at 177 mph.

Watch the video on Genovation's Facebook Page.

The new record was certified by the International Mile Racing Association and the vehicle has earned the official title of, ""Top Speed Street Legal Electric Car.""

The GXE capitalized on the Corvette Z06's light body as a platform to incorporate an innovative electric powertrain good for over 700 hp and 600 pound-feet of torque. Genovation claims the prototype has a 50:50 weight distribution and a range of 130 miles during ""normal driving operation."" I'm guessing drag racing doesn't fall under that category.

""We are thrilled that the result of our development testing led to the setting of this record. Based on our experience so far, we believe the car to be extremely robust as we set the record on our first day of testing,"" said Genovation CEO Andrew Saul. The company added that its work on the GXE isn't finished and it expects the EV to reach higher levels of performance very soon.",[]

The state requires 490 days of schooling to become a licensed cosmetologist. Students have to learn how to apply makeup, style and color hair and must pass a licensing exam to become a licensed cosmetologist.

Hair-braiding is barely taught in most cosmetology schools, but anyone wanting to make a few dollars by braiding hair  a practice most common in African-American communities, where traditional hair-braiding has been taught for centuries  has to go through the cosmetology licensing process.

Those 2,100 hours of training can cost as much as $20,000 in tuition and fees. Getting licensed also requires a high school diploma or GED, as if passing algebra was essential to understanding how to braid hair.

To put it simply, this is ridiculous, said Jessica Herrmann, director of legislative outreach for the Platte Institute of Economic Research. Hair braiders must not only obtain permission from the government, but also spend thousands of dollars on course instruction on coloring, men and womens cutting, waxing, home creative skills, skin and spa services and chemistry. This burdensome regulation creates a huge financial barrier to entry for this new class of entrepreneurs.

But skipping that lengthy and expensive process means facing the potential penalties for being an unlicensed cosmetologist. Those include fines of up to $25,000 and the potential of four years in prison.

Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova said Monday in Los Angeles that she tested positive for the banned substance Meldonium at the Australian Open earlier this year.

The 28-year-old Sharapova - winner of five Grand Slam titles, 35 singles titles and currently ranked 7th in the world - discussed the failed doping test during a press conference, saying that Meldonium is a substance she had begun taking in 2006 to help her with a variety of health problems.

However, the drug - said to increase physical and mental performance - was added to a list of banned substances in early 2016 and she said she was unaware of its change in status, adding that she took full responsibility for that oversight.

""I don't want to end my career this way,"" Sharapova said. ""I really hope I will be given another chance to play this game.""

The Russian - who is the richest sportwoman in the world - has not played since she lost her quarterfinals match at the Australian Open.

The court in the western province of Intibuca issued the order on Saturday, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

The court imposed ""an order of permanence in the country"" on Castro in order to have him ""give a deposition before the authorities with jurisdiction"" over the case in Honduras, the ministry said.

The court order was communicated to the Mexican Embassy on the same day.

The Mexican activist was wounded last week when Caceres was murdered.

The 44-year-old Caceres, leader and co-founder of the Civic Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras, or Copinh, was killed on March 3 at her home in the western Honduran town of La Esperanza by two gunmen, investigators said.

The Foreign Ministry said the National Migration Institute was also notified about the court order, and as a result, Castro was intercepted Sunday at Tegucigalpa International Airport in the presence of Mexican authorities as he attempted to board a plane back to Mexico.

The activist ""was the only person accompanying"" the indigenous leader when she was slain and it is ""fundamental that he give more a detailed statement to the justice system in Honduras before leaving the country,"" the ministry said.

Castro ""will have all the protective measures specified in the Witness Protection Law of the Penal Process, in compliance with national regulations,"" the ministry said.

Caceres was buried on Saturday in La Esperanza during a funeral at which thousands, including representatives of organizations in Brazil, the United States, Switzerland, Mexico and Central America, bid their final farewells.

Family, friends and political leaders, including former President Manuel Zelaya, traveled to La Esperanza to attend the vigil at the home of the indigenous leader's mother.

One of Caceres's daughters said Saturday that a Honduran-Chinese joint venture that plans to build a hydroelectric power plant was behind her mother's death.

Speaking at the premiere of The Perfect Match on Monday, the two actresses brushed aside the controversy about race and said they are waiting to see how Saldana does in the title role.

""I think Zoe Saldana's a great actress, so I am looking forward to it,"" Latifah said. ""And, you know, she is of African descent. I don't see why she shouldn't get to play the role. But I just want to see it  you know, get rid of the hype, and let's go watch the movie.""

Simone's daughter, Lisa Simone Kelly, and others have decried Saldana's casting since she took the part in 2012. Her skin was apparently darkened for the role, and she wears a prosthetic nose.

The Simone estate, which cooperated in making the Oscar-nominated documentary, ""What Happened, Miss Simone?,"" recently tweeted: ""Hopefully people begin to understand this is painful. Gut-wrenching, heartbreaking, nauseating, soul-crushing.""

Patton, though, said she's ""not into negativity like that,"" especially since the film has yet to be released.

""I think it's a horrible thing to put that on somebody,"" she said Monday. ""Clearly someone thought she was perfect for it. She's an amazing actress, she's beautiful and you haven't even given her a chance and you haven't seen it yet.""

She added, ""Imagine being in her shoes and enduring that. It's not cool, and it's not right. I think we have to be in a place where we celebrate each other and are kind to one another and say there's all different versions of the story and versions of an idea.""

Simone Kelly came to Saldanas defense recently, saying the attacks of the actress are unfortunate and should be re-directed at the studio, producers and the films director.

Its unfortunate that Zoe Saldana is being attacked so viciously when she is someone who is part of a larger picture, Simone Kelly told Time magazine. Its clear she brought her best to this project, but unfortunately shes being attacked when shes not responsible for any of the writing or the lies.""

In ""Nina,"" Saldana plays the Grammy-winning singer and outspoken civil rights activist, who struggled with depression and alcoholism after finding fame. David Oyelowo co-stars as her stalwart friend, Clifton Henderson, who helped her return to music.

RLJ Entertainment will release ""Nina"" in theaters and digital HD on April 22. ""The Perfect Match"" opens Friday.

Unusually, one of the seals belonged to a woman, making it an extremely rare find.

Archaeologists found two seals bearing Hebrew names in a large structure built of stone blocks that dates to the First Temple period.

Finding seals that bear names from the time of the First Temple is hardly a commonplace occurrence, and finding a seal that belonged to a woman is an even rarer phenomenon, explained the researchers, in a statement released by the Israel Antiquities Authority.



The seals belonged to Elihana bat Gael, a woman, and Saaryahu ben Shabenyahu, a man. Experts believe the building where the seals were found served as an administrative center.

Seals such as those found in Jerusalem were used to for signing documents and frequently inlaid as part of a ring the owner wore. Elihanas seal is made of semi-precious stone, and contains the mirror-writing of to Elihana bat Gael, inscribed in ancient Hebrew letters. Additionally, they confirmed that Elihanas father's name is also on the seal, which dates back 2,500 years.



Although there is very little additional information on Elihana, expert Hagai Misgav, of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said the retention of her fathers name indicates that her social status came from her original family rather than her married family.

At least she had thata few minutes to enjoy the squeals of her adoring daughters and, after months of living close to a hospital in Wichita to play it safe, getting to see the century-old white farmhouse her family had worked so hard to make home.

""It was a good few minutes,"" Rott tells ABC News. Five minutes later, after complaining of chest pain, Casi was being raced down the gravel road by Joey, who knew he'd already lost her.

It had happened once already: Casi suffered a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in her lungs) just days after the triplets were delivered by C-section, but the doctors and family thought that with medications everything was under control.

And while she lived to be able to see her girls again, Joey is now left to endure the tragic loss while caring for five children.

A family friend who also has triplets set up a GoFundMe page that asked for $10,000 and is already closing in on $100,000. Family members are also helping, and donations have been set up to help pay for a night service so that Joey, an IT worker, can sleep.

Chloe, the 7-year-old, is helping care for her toddler sister and hopes her mom's tombstone can be heart-shaped but flat on the bottom, so it can stand forever.

Will Republicans please stop insulting Trump voters? Just stop. I know that many hate Trump, but his voters too?

Mitt Romney derides Trump voters as suckers. Others have sneered that Trump has an army of low information voters who have been duped, and that these people shouldnt be able to decide on the fate of a Grand Old Party. Trumps voters, the political class screams, have hijacked the Republican Party.

Another conservative commentator complained the other day that many of these voters have never even voted before and they are not even Republicans. Huh?

Isnt it a good thing that Trump is steering millions of new voters away from the Democrats and attracting them to the GOP? I thought we were told Republicans lost in 2012 because so many conservatives stayed home. Here they are.

RELATED: Krauthammer: Why Trump is Winning the Values Voters

The GOPs mighty establishment wing  the people who get rich off the game of politics -- pretend that theirs is the party of the working class, of blue collar virtue, and hard work, but now that the workers they supposedly represent are in revolt, apparently the problem is the voters not the party. This is insanity.

This is like the executives at Coca Cola blaming the stupid public for not liking New Coke. What kind of a company blames its customers when things go wrong? Inside Washington, there are no term limits on stupidity.

Former House Republican majority leader Tom DeLay advised on Fox this past Friday that Republicans should do all they can to stop Trump from getting a majority (though he will likely have a plurality) and then at the convention, throw Trump and his troublemaking voters under the bus and pick someone who got millions of fewer votes than Trump did. Delays point is that the party and its delegates, not the voters, should choose who the nominee is. He seemed to be saying: its our club and we make the rules. (Funny, Republicans just a few weeks ago were guffawing that Democrats had rigged their primary process.)

The rules of the party apparently say that Delay is right. So the master plan is to let the elites decide whats best for us.

On Monday, Cornyn, the Senates No. 2 Republican, warned that anyone President Barack Obama nominates to fill the seat left vacant by the late Justice Antonin Scalia could be subjected to a bruising confirmation battle.

I think they will bear some resemblance to a pinata, Cornyn said, according to CNN. He questioned why any nominee would allow themselves to be used in a political fight, adding there is no guarantee, certainly, after that time theyre going to look as good as they did going in.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest accused the Texas leader of striking a tone similar to the GOP front-runner in the presidential race.

Given Sen. Cornyns language, it sounds like he might spend a little too much time watching Donald Trump rallies, Earnest told reporters in a briefing Tuesday.

Earnest said Cornyn effectively raised the stakes by saying that not only would Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee not consider potential nominees, but that such candidates  no matter how qualified  could endure a career-damaging process.

Hes suggesting that they will be subjected to bashing by Republicans, Earnest said, later adding: Republicans are digging in even further in an unreasonable position of not giving that person any sort of fair hearing, and in fact, vowing to try to tear this person down.

Cornyn clarified his remarks on the Senate floor Tuesday, his press team pointed out in an email to The Dallas Morning News.

I would be surprised if any person who actually aspired to be on the United States Supreme Court, a current judge or a legal scholar or lawyer, would allow themselves to be used by this administration in making a nomination to the Supreme Court for a seat that will not be filled during the remainder of President Obamas term  knowing that they wont be confirmed, Cornyn said.

He used the pinata comparison, he explained, only to say that the confirmation process around here has gotten pretty tough.

Both sides have accused each other of playing politics in an election year. Senate Republicans have vowed to block attempts by Obama to fill the conservative Scalias seat, arguing that Obama should punt the appointment to the next president. The White House contends its not only within the presidents purview to nominate a candidate, but his constitutional duty.

According to the Daily Mail, the video was filmed by witness Sharon Kessler and posted on YouTube by her friend Mark Frauenfelder, a journalist and former editor of Wired magazine. The video shows the two being told by police officers to leave the JetBlue plane before its flight from Boston to Los Angeles Saturday. The women, wearing hijabs, are seen silently gathering their hand luggage while other passengers remain seated and the flight continued on without incident.

In a caption below the YouTube video, which has since been made private but is available on other channels, Frauenfelder said Kessler overheard a flight attendant tell a co-worker that she didnt like the way two Muslim women were staring back at her.

The desert tortoises, already under stress from drought, disease and human interference, will be airlifted later this month from 130,000 acres surrounding the Corps' Air Ground Combat Center. The center is undergoing an expansion to facilitate live fire and maneuver training for full-scale Marine Expeditionary Brigade-sized elements.

""The situation makes us feel like we'll have to write off California's Mojave population."" - Glenn Stewart, Desert Tortoise Council

""This spring, the Marine Corps will translocate approximately 1,180 desert tortoises in order to safeguard the animals coming from lands newly acquired through an NDAA-mandated (National Defense Authorization Act) land withdrawal that supports Marine Corps-mandated training requirements,"" base spokesman Capt. Justin Smith wrote in an e-mail to the Desert Sun.

Related Image Expand / Contract The Marines have tried to co-exist with the tortoises, but have had mixed results. (US Marine Corps)

The area slated for expansion is in prime tortoise habitat, and the number of breeding adults has dropped by about 50 percent over the last decade, according to a recent survey by federal biologists.

Some environmentalists are against the pricey effort to relocate the tortoises, which can stress the animals and leave them vulnerable to dehydration, predators and human interaction, they said.

""I wish the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would get some backbone and say it can't permit another tortoise translocation by the military,"" Glenn Stewart, a biologist and member of the board of directors of the Desert Tortoise Council conservation group, told the Los Angeles Times. ""The situation makes us feel like we'll have to write off California's Mojave population.""

In 2008, the Army moved 670 tortoises from its National Training Center near Barstow to new homes in the western Mojave. That $8.6 million effort proved disastrous when it was learned that a large percentage of them died within a year, many eaten by coyotes.

Brian Henen, a biologist and head of the Marine Corps' translocation effort, told the Times the project's ample budget and commitment to monitor the tortoises for 30 years ""demonstrates how much we care about this species.""

The plan, approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, will utilize 100 biologists who will capture 900 adult tortoises and put transmitters on them before releasing them on nearby public lands. Another 235 hatchlings raised in pens at the base also will be relocated once they are strong enough to survive on their own. The project will take an estimated two to four weeks to complete, officials said.

The Combat Center raises the hatchlings in its 6-acre Tortoise Research and Captive Rearing Site, which is operated jointly with UCLA.

The desert tortoise is classified as a threatened species because its numbers have declined rapidly over the past few decades due to predators and disease. Soft shells leave young tortoises vulnerable to predators ranging from ants and ground squirrels to ravens and coyotes.",[]

The same elite team didn't have that comfortable of a time turning it around on the Orlando Magic to establish an NBA-record home winning streak.

It's back to a similar weight class for both Tuesday night in Los Angeles with some added confidence as the Lakers try for a third win in five games.

Sunday's 112-95 home win over Golden State came with Kobe Bryant spending the fourth quarter on the bench nursing an aching right shoulder. The Lakers (13-51) already led by 11 entering the fourth as Russell and Jordan Clarkson outplayed Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Clarkson finished with a game-high 25 points and Russell had 21.

""I really don't know how we came together for yesterday's game,"" Russell told the team's official website. ""But we did it and shocked a lot of people - we shocked ourselves. We knew what we were capable of, but we did it.""

Clarkson was 4 of 6 from 3-point range and has averaged 18.6 points while shooting 46.6 percent from deep in his last nine games.

""We got to put another one together tomorrow,"" Clarkson said. ""It doesn't mean anything if we come and get blown out tomorrow. If we get blown out, that's taking steps back for us.""

Russell has started the last eight and scored 19.9 points per game while connecting on 49.0 percent from beyond the arc, and in those eight games with the rookie at point guard, Los Angeles has limited itself to 10.9 turnovers per game after being at 14.1 through 56 contests. Russell has a 2.50 assist-to-turnover ratio in that time with 2.00 turnovers per game, while he added four steals as the Warriors turned it over 20 times.

What might have been most impressive was the defensive effort with the Warriors going 4 of 30 from 3-point range, including 1 of 18 from Curry and Thompson. That, however, has hardly been a trend with the Lakers' last 10 opponents shooting 50.5 percent and 41.1 from beyond the arc for 113.2 points per game without going to overtime.

""I was thinking after the game: 'Maybe we have turned that corner and our guys are showing some maturity and some growth,'"" said coach Byron Scott, whose team is playing the third of an eight-game homestand. ""We'll really see what we have tomorrow.""

The Magic have won the last two meetings, including a 101-99 home victory Nov. 11, but the Lakers have won the last two in Los Angeles.

Orlando (27-35) was in it until the end in Monday's 119-113 loss at Golden State despite allowing the Warriors to shoot 50 percent and hit 16 of 35 from 3-point range. The Magic stayed in the game because Golden State turned the ball over 24 times.

Aaron Gordon had 20 points and 16 rebounds as Nikola Vucevic sat out because of a strained groin, and Evan Fournier and Brandon Jennings each scored 20 as well. It was Jennings' top scoring effort in 10 games with his new team.

As for Vucevic, he made it sound like the nagging injury will keep him out longer than a game as Orlando enters the second of a four-game road trip.

""It's just a bad time because we're trying to make the playoffs and this is a really big trip for us,"" Vucevic told the team's official website. ""It felt better during the All-Star break, but after that I just reaggravated it, so it's frustrating now.""",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Trilogy for popular Mexican love story 'Like Water for Chocolate' in the works,['Suzette Laboy'],"Laura Esquivel, who is author of Mexican novel Like Water for Chocolate.Suzette Laboy

It was a love story told through food and cooking that quickly became an international classic.

The Mexican novel Like Water for Chocolate, written by Laura Esquivel, had been translated into a handful of languages after its release in 1989. By 1992, it was turned into an award-winning film with Esquivel serving as screenwriter.

Like Water for Chocolate follows the story of true love between Tita and Pedro in Mexico at the turn of the 20th century, a time when family tradition held that the youngest daughter in the family was forbidden to marry. Tita is forced to take care of her widowed, tyrannical mother while Pedro marries Titas older sister. Their oppressed love is told through recipes as Tita cooks her way through desperation, hope and independence.

More than two decades later, those themes still resonate today.

Theres a new generation that is discovering the novel, Esquivel told with Fox News Latino. That, I did not expect, that they would continue finding something in it that moves them.

The novel quickly became an international bestseller, while the film swept the Mexican Academy Awards in 1993 and was the highest-grossing Spanish language film in U.S. box office history. With all its success, Esquivel said one thing remained constant in her life: love.

What has never changed, what is always present and what is in the end what sustains us is that energy that I talk about in Like Water for Chocolate...that loving energy. Without that I wouldnt have had the strength to keep going and enjoy life.

And that theme may just be what connects the next generation to Titas story.

Now the story continues.

Esquivel is working on a trilogy based on her popular novel. El diario de Tita (Titas Diary) will be published in Mexico in April, followed by her third book later in the year.

The film was showcased during the South Beach Wine and Food Festival recently. It will also be featured at the Miami International Film Festival, which ends on Sunday.

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,More former Gitmo detainees suspected of returning to battlefield,[],"A dozen former detainees at Guantanamo Bay are suspected of returning to the battlefield on behalf of various militant groups, according to a report released by the Obama administration Monday.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said that seven of the 144 detainees who have been freed since President Barack Obama took office in 2009 have been confirmed to have returned to fighting as of Jan. 15. The ODNI's previous report, from this past July, said six detainees had gone back to battle.

The number of suspected recidivist detainees was double the number in this past July's report. The increase is likely to spark new protests by Republicans opposed to President Obama's plan to shut down the facility and transfer dozens of detainees to prisons in the U.S.

Under Obama's plan, roughly 35 of the 91 current prisoners will be transferred to other countries in the coming months, leaving up to 60 detainees who are either facing trial by military commission or have been determined to be too dangerous to release but are not facing charges. Those detainees would be relocated to a U.S. facility.

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said last month that Republicans are taking legal steps to stop Obama from closing the prison. Ryan told reporters that lawmakers have the votes to block Obama's plan in Congress and enough votes to override any veto.

""These detainees cannot come to American soil,"" Ryan said at the time.

The ODNI report does not specify where or for which groups the former detainees are confirmed or suspected to be fighting.

The report also found that 111 of 532 prisoners released by the George W. Bush administration had returned to the battlefield, while another 74 were suspected of doing so.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.

""One morning we woke up to news of a beheading by a terrorist organization the media chose to refer to as ISIS,"" the business states. ""That meant bad news for us."" Since then, Isis Women's Health Care has received dozens of death threats, WSB-TV reports.

""I became concerned for me and my staff,"" Dr. Hughan Frederick tells WXIA. Finally, one caller made it clear it was time for a name change.

""This particular individual identified himself as ex-military and indicated for us not to be surprised if someone were to come and shoot up the building,"" Isis administrator Randy Haviland says.

WSB-TV reports Isis Women's Health Care will announce its new name at the end of the month. But judging by its website, it will now be known as Nile Women's Health Care.

That's in keeping with its original Egyptian themethe business was named for the Egyptian goddess of motherhood. Even before a new name was chosen, Isis removed signage from outside its three Atlanta-area offices to head off further threats.

This year marks the 10th anniversary for Isis Womens Health Care, but instead of hoisting celebration banners, we are taking down the namesake that has proudly delivered thousands of babies, the business states.

(It's not the only business named Isis in America.)

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,College replay officials will have more say in targeting,[],"Replay officials will have more say about what is a targeting penalty in college football next season.

The NCAA playing rules oversight panel approved on Tuesday a proposal by the rules committee to expand instant replay officials' authority regarding targeting fouls. Replay officials now will be able to call ''egregious'' targeting penalties missed by on-field officials. They also will have more flexibility to overturn incorrect targeting calls.

Targeting results in a 15-yard penalty and the ejection of the player who commits the foul.

All targeting fouls are reviewed, but replay officials have been limited to reviewing only if there was forcible contact to the head and neck area and if the hit was made with the crown of the helmet. Under this proposal, how the contact occurred, whether the player launched into an opponent or whether the contact was more incidental, also can be reviewed.

There were 158 targeting penalties called in all FBS games last season. Forty-three were overturned by replay review and 115 were upheld.

The oversight panel also approved the use of electronic devices such as laptop computers and tablets coach coaching purposes during games. They will be permitted in press boxes and the locker room but not on the sidelines.

The home school is responsible for ensuring identical television and video capability and internet connectivity in the coaches' booths for both teams.

Other changes approved by the panel:

 Players who leave the tackle box will be prohibited from blocking below the waist toward the initial position of the ball.

 A ball carrier who has clearly given himself up by sliding feet first will be covered by rules pertaining to defenseless players.

 Deliberately tripping a ball carrier with the leg will be a foul.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Missouri educator fired over role in protests files appeal,[],"A former University of Missouri assistant communications professor is appealing her firing last month over her role last year in a race-related student protest, suggesting that her ouster was political.

Melissa Click, in a statement Tuesday, insisted her Feb. 25 dismissal by the university system's governing curators was unfair by failing to follow the normal, on-campus procedures for reacting to faculty misconduct. More than 100 state lawmakers, mostly Republican, had called for her removal.

""In their decision to terminate my employment, the curators bowed to conservative voices that seek to tarnish my stellar 12-year record at MU,"" Click wrote. ""Instead of disciplining me for conduct that does not 'meet expectations for a university faculty member,' the curators are punishing me for standing with students who have drawn attention to the issue of overt racism at the University of Missouri.""

Click, whose firing followed her suspension in January, added that the governing board ""is using me as a scapegoat to distract from larger campus issues, but their termination of my employment will not remedy the environment of injustice that persists at MU.""

A spokesman for the curators, John Fougere, said Tuesday that board had no comment.

Click's statement came a day after the American Association of University Professors announced that three members would visit the Columbia campus later this month to investigate the process leading to Click's firing and whether it violated her right to due process and ""whether conditions for academic freedom and tenure at the institution are sound.""

Click's supporters have questioned the curators' move, by a 4-2 vote, to decide Click's fate rather than allowing the school to use its normal, on-campus procedures for reacting to faculty misconduct.

""The AAUP's action underscores my belief that the curators have overstepped their authority,"" Click said Tuesday.

In voicing support of 45-year-old Click's firing, top university administrators cited her run-ins with police during October protests in Columbia and with two student journalists weeks later on the Columbia campus, including a videotaped confrontation where she called for ""some muscle"" to remove a videographer from the protest area.

During the October matter, Click was recorded telling police to get their hands off students during a protest, then hugging the students and cursing at an officer who grabbed her.

The protests, spurred by what activists said was administrators' indifference to racial issues on campus, prompted the Columbia chancellor and system president to resign after the protests escalated, with one student's hunger strike and an announcement by members of the football team that they would refuse to play.

Click has said she regretted her actions, claiming her actions were meant to safeguard protesters from retaliation. But in Tuesday's statement, she wrote that ""I will not apologize for my support of black students who experience racism at the University of Missouri.""",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge Smartphones Look Like Winners,[],"The Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge seem to have most, if not all, of the ingredients for being the smartest-designed smartphones on the market. Not only do these Galaxy S7 devices claim to fend off damage from accidental dunks in water but they also do so without the flimsy-seeming flaps that get in the way when youre trying to plug in a USB cable. Their large-capacity batteries promise long runs between charging sessions, and their displays minimize phone fiddling by continually showing you the time and other notifications even after the display goes to sleep.

And then theres the affordable, do-it-yourself storage upgrades via Micro SD memory cards. Finally theres a new camera, which Samsung says is twice as bright and four times as fast as the already good one on its previous models. This despite the camera downsizing in resolution from 16 megapixels to 12.

Our full assessment of these models' camera, water resistance, battery life, and more will have to wait until we finish testing the retail versions we bought. In the meantime, here are additional impressions from the Galaxy S7 edge press sample Ive had in my hands for the past few days.

Relative Comfort

The softer, rounder edges do appear to make these glass-and-metal phones more comfortable to hold, particularly when comparing the Galaxy S7 edge to last years Galaxy S6 edge model. But despite its softer edges, the S7 edge, whose 2.7-inch width is 1/10 of an inch narrower than the S6 edge, is still a big phone. And that makes reaching app icons or menus on the upper parts of the screen a challenge for anyone without extra-long fingers.

Photos That Won't Keep Still

The Samsung S7 and S7 edge have new camera hardware but their menus and picture options remain largely the same, except for a mildly interesting photo effect called Motion photo. This feature, which is similar to Live Photos on the iPhone 6s models, breathes life into still photos by turning them into GIF-like movie clips lasting several seconds.

Its not magic. Rather, the camera constantly buffers a few seconds of video; once you press the camera shutter it grabs a snippet of that video. Motion photos can be viewed only on these new Galaxy S7 models, and you can share them with other Galaxy S7s. For now, if you send a Motion photo to friends with any other type of smartphone, theyll see only a still image.

Beefier Batteries

Samsung beefed up the storage capacity of the batteries in the new S7 models. The batteries on the Galaxy S6 and S6 edge were 2,550mAh and 2,600mAh, respectively; their battery life each earned a Very Good in our Ratings. Not too shabby. But the extra capacity of the S7 (3,000mAh) and S7 edge (3,600mAh) could mean these devices will keep on working long after you say goodnight. Our lab testing will provide the full story.

Better Fingerprint Reader

Fingerprint readers are one of the easiest ways to safely unlock a phone screen or sanction a transaction, and Samsung smartphones have had this feature for several generations. Yet these fingerprint readers have always been, shall we say, a bit more temperamental than the iPhones Touch ID. You had to swipe your finger a certain way. But with the S7, resting your finger on the home button unlocks the screen. In my informal tests, it worked quite consistently.

Missing Notifications

Its cool that these Galaxies can continuously show the time, the date, and app notifications after the display goes to sleep. This feature, called Always On, is also on the upcoming LG G5. But I was a little disappointed with Samsung's implementation of Always On. Theres currently no notification support for third-party apps like Facebook, or even the weather.

There are also limits on what you can see. For instance, you have to choose between Calendar and Clock. Calendar mode shows you all the days of the month, plus the time and remaining battery life (as a percentage). Clock shows you the date and battery life and adds message notifications. Most people will probably find Clock view the most useful, but Samsung could make a good thing better by adding alternating views and notification support for popular third-party apps.

A Small Disconnect

Many consumers are holding onto their smartphones longer because, frankly, improvements from one years model to the next have become somewhat incremental. These Samsungs seem to have what it takes to please their owners for a long time.

And thats why its a shame that Samsung didnt equip them with a USB Type-C port, the connector youre going to see on a growing number of smartphones, tablets, and computers, including those from Apple. A USB Type-C connection has significant advantages over USB 2.0, which is being phased out. For instance, it can simultaneously charge a phone while providing dramatically faster data connections (10 gigabits per second vs. 0.5 gigabits per second), which youll appreciate if your streaming hi-res video to your Ultra HD TV or transferring several gigabytes of files off your phone to a computer.

And, just like the Lightning connector on an iPhone, USB Type-C connectors can be inserted into the phone no matter which way you hold it. That eliminates the fumbling and squinting that has become a ritual on phones that use micro-USB cables.

Warren writes that while ""you can summarize every other religion with the word 'do,'"" Christians are different in that they do not have to ""earn their way"" to God.

The system could prove invaluable for airdrops in difficult terrain and urban environments, researchers say.

The military has been working for years to boost the accuracy of its airdrops when resupplying troops. As part of this effort, the Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS), which uses GPS, an onboard computer and a steerable parachute, was developed in 2006. The technology was deployed in the field three years  it accounted for about 1 percent of the total airdrops conducted by the U.S. Air Force in Afghanistan.

Now, the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is working on an even more accurate airdrop alternative to GPS as part of an ambitious multi-service project.

""In some terrains, such as steep canyons, or urban settings with tall buildings, you can lose GPS - these are gliding systems, so they can't fly up in altitude."" Richard Benney, Director of the Aerial Delivery Directorate at NSRDEC, told FoxNews.com. We're researching and testing what we call a video navigation system  currently it's simply a camera that's looking down and out towards the ground in the direction of flight.""

Related: High-tech 'bazooka' fires a net to take down drones

Benney explained that the video navigation system picks up targets, such as reference points or features in the local landscape. We will probably feed the JPADS an image just before it's deployed out of the aircraft from the USAF JPADS mission planner, he said. The image can come from a satellite, UAS [Unmanned Aerial System] or other sources - it will tell the JPADS 'your job is to land on that pixel'.

The as-yet unnamed video navigation system is currently being tested in desert environments and there are plans to upgrade the JPADS fleet with the new technology over the next three to five years.

Related: New tech gives US helicopter pilots 'Superman-style' vision

The video navigation technology will eventually guide a wide range of payloads to their intended targets. There are two variants of JPADS  a 2K version that handles weights from 700 pounds up to 2,200 pounds and a 10K version for weights from 5,000 pounds to 10,000 pounds.

Benney explained that 2Ks can be dropped from as low as 3,500 feet and up to 25,000 feet, whereas 10Ks are dropped between 18,000 and 25,000 feet.

Related: Air Force unveils initial B-21 long range bomber design

Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Draper Lab, under contract with the U.S. Army, developed the JPADS flight software and is one of the lead partners on the flight vision software.

Initial indications suggest that video navigation airdrops offer an extremely high level of accuracy. The 2K requirement is to be within 150 meters [492 feet] of the target, but it's considerably better than that, Benney told FoxNews.com. [The] 10K target is [to be within] 250 meters [820 feet] for the target, but it's significantly better than that.""

At least eight U.S. airlines have submitted applications to the U.S. Department of Transportation outlining their plans and routes for possible commercial flights to the island.

Government officials said the requests will be reviewed over the next few months and the routes are expected to be awarded in the summer. In the meantime, the airlines also need to apply to Cubas civil aviation authority for permits to operate in the country.

Most of the planes proposed by U.S. airlines would carry about 160 passengers.

American Airlines was the most-aggressive carrier in its approach, requesting more than half the possible slots to Havana plus service to five other, smaller Cuban cities. The airline has a large hub in Miami, home to the largest Cuban-American population.

In American's filing with the DOT, CEO Doug Parker wrote that his airline has been ""the undisputed leader"" in charter service, having done so since 1991.

The airline notes in its application that last year alone, it operated 1,084 Cuba charters while JetBlue Airways had 221 and Delta Air Lines had four.

Following Wednesday's route application deadline, airlines and the public have a chance to comment on the flights sought. That process will conclude by March 21.

The airlines won't get all of their requests, but below are the routes each carrier applied to fly:

 American is seeking 10 daily flights from Miami to Havana, one from Charlotte and one from Dallas as well as one weekly flight from both Los Angeles and Chicago. From Miami, it is also looking for two daily flights to Santa Clara, Holguin and Varadero and daily service to Camaguey and Cienfuegos.

 Delta is seeking flights from Atlanta, New York, Miami and Orlando to Havana. All would be daily, except for Miami where Delta is seeking two daily flights.

 JetBlue is looking to serve Havana with four daily flights from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, two from Tampa, Florida, Orlando and New York and one daily flight from Boston and Newark, New Jersey. It also wants one daily flight from Fort Lauderdale to Camaguey, Holguin and Santa Clara.

 Southwest Airlines wants to fly to Havana with six daily flights from Fort Lauderdale, two from Tampa and one daily flight from Orlando. It also applied for daily flights from Fort Lauderdale to Varadero and one to Santa Clara.

 United Airlines is asking for daily flights between Newark, New Jersey, and Havana with two flights on Saturdays. It also wants Saturday-only flights from Chicago, Houston and Washington D.C.

 Alaska Airlines wants two daily flights from Los Angeles to Havana.

 Frontier Airlines applied for one daily flight between Denver and Havana, three daily flights between Miami and Havana, one daily flight between Miami and Santiago, four weekly flights between Miami and Camaguey, three weekly flights between Miami and Santa Clara, one weekly flight between Chicago and Varadero and one weekly flight between Philadelphia and Varadero.

 Silver Airways, a Florida-based regional airline, wants to fly to Havana twice daily from West Palm Beach, once daily from Fort Myers and Fort Lauderdale, five times a week from Key West, and twice a week from Jacksonville. It also proposed to fly from Fort Lauderdale to nine other Cuban cities.

While regular U.S. tourists still won't legally be allowed to visit Cuba, the start of commercial flights will make it much easier for those who fall into one of the authorized categories.

All flights operating between the two countries today are charters, which are expensive, frequently chaotic and lack many of the traditional supports of commercial aviation such as online booking and 24-hour customer service.

Nearly 160,000 U.S. leisure travelers flew to Cuba last year, along with hundreds of thousands of Cuban-Americans visiting family. Tourism is still barred, but the number of legal reasons to go to Cuba  from organizing professional meetings to distributing information to Cubans  has grown so large and is so loosely enforced that the distinction from tourism has blurred significantly.

This weekend, the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series rolls into the 1-mile Phoenix International Raceway for the Good Sam 500. Here are five drivers who need some luck this weekend:

KYLE LARSON -- It's been a slow 2016 campaign so far for Larson, who is in his third season driving one of Chip Ganassi's Chevrolets. Larson has yet to lead a lap at PIR, and has an average finish of 16.00 here.

GREG BIFFLE -- In 24 starts at PIR, Biffle has earned five top fives, including a pair of runner-up finishes. He's also led 389 laps here. But in Biffle's five most recent starts at PIR, his average finish is 18.2.

CLINT BOWYER -- In the fall race here in 2012, Bowyer was crashed out by Jeff Gordon in a retaliatory move that triggered a huge brawl on pit road. Lately this track hasn't been good to Bowyer; in his last five starts here, he has just one finish inside the top 20, a 13th in this race two years ago.

CHASE ELLIOTT -- In three Cup races this season, Elliott has crashed twice. Once was his fault, the other wasn't. The second-generation has never raced a Cup car at PIR, but in four NASCAR XFINITY Series starts here, he's never finished worse than ninth.

MATT KENSETH -- The 2003 Sprint Cup champ is having a rotten start to his season, currently sitting 22nd in points. Over his career, Kenseth's results at PIR have been all over the board. Although he has one victory here, Kenseth has just one top five and two top 10s in his last nine starts at PIR.",[]

foxnews.com,,Marco Rubio races to preserve Miami edge,"['Nick Gass', 'Isaac Arnsdorf', 'Nolan D', 'Kyle Cheney', 'Joseph Marks', 'Daniel Lippman', 'Bernie Becker', 'Kate Tummarello', 'Glenn Thrush', 'Hadas Gold']","MIAMI  Marco Rubio has come home to preserve a shot at the White House or, as hes calling it these days, la Casa Blanca.

As his opponents began racking up fresh wins in contests throughout the country, the Florida senator has retrenched to his roots. Rubio is campaigning more in Spanish, especially in his home county of Miami-Dade, which has 274,000 Hispanic Republicans.

Story Continued Below

Many speak Spanish as a preferred first language  particularly in Hialeah, the countys most-Republican city with a 95 percent Hispanic population where Rubio campaigns on Wednesday.

At the same time, a super PAC backing him has been running Spanish-language TV ads and another political committee is advertising on Spanish-language radio with a spot featuring Latin crooner Willy Chirino, an icon in the Cuban exile community thats the backbone of the Miami-areas Republican Party.

We can make history when Marco Rubio arrives at the White House, Chirino says in the ad. Marco fills us with pride and he takes with him our yearnings and dreams.

Rubios campaign in the past week has begun targeting Hispanic Republicans in three specially identified sectors of the county to vote early in person or with vote-by-mail ballots. And they are voting at relatively high rates now.

Though Hispanics account for about 73 percent of registered Republicans in the county, their early voting turnout rate is about 79 percent, according to an analysis by University of Florida political science professor Daniel A. Smith.

Just how those voters voted wont be known until their ballots are tallied on Election Day Tuesday  and Smith and others wonder how many voted for Miamis other bilingual candidate, Jeb Bush, before he dropped out on Feb. 20. As many as 20,000 absentee ballots in Miami-Dade alone might have been cast while Jeb was still running.

Smith said Rubio will need a large turnout in his home county, which is Floridas most-populous, to remain competitive in the state. Rubio has been losing to Donald Trump in every Florida poll since August.

Rubios fellow Cuban-American senator, Ted Cruz, is in a more-distant third.

Smith was the first to analyze the Republican ballots returned  690,000 statewide as of Tuesday morning  and determined over the weekend that almost 18 percent of the voters didnt cast ballots in the 2012 or 2014 general election.

Smith suspects they might be voters attracted to Trump.

These are Republicans who didnt vote against Barack Obama in 2012 or for Gov. Rick Scott in 2014 against Charlie Crist, Smith said.

Are they excited about the race because there are two Cuban-Americans on the ballot or because there were two guys from Miami who were running at the same time? Or are they excited about the guy in the red hat? Smith asked, referencing Trumps Make America Great Again trademark ballcaps.

Some Republicans in Miami acknowledge that Trump is also popular with a segment of the Cuban-American community thats drawn to his blunt, outspoken style. A recent poll showed Rubio faring most poorly against Trump in Central Florida, where Rubio has spent more time campaigning  including in Spanish.

The Orlando television market has about 54,000 registered Hispanic Republicans, many of Puerto Rican descent or birth. And Rubio, who campaigned Tuesday in the Puerto Rican-heavy Central Florida city of Kissimmee, hopes his big Sunday win in Puerto Ricos GOP primary inspires a bigger turnout in Florida.

Rubio was the only GOP candidate to campaign in the territory. And hes the only Republican candidate to give interviews and speeches in Spanish.

As he was winning the Puerto Rico primary, Rubio was back in Miami Sunday, where he gave three interviews in English and three in Spanish. Cruz is far-less fluent in his fathers native tongue, though he challenged Rubio on the debate stage in serviceable Spanish when the Florida senator questioned his ability to understand the language.

Because Spanish is the lingua franca of so many Republicans in the county, Rubio  a one-time pundit for Spanish-language Univision  has jokingly pledged to bring Cuban culture to the presidency, like a caja China, a pork-roasting barbecue box used.

Vamos a llevar una caja China a la Casa Blanca! (We will bring a caja china to the White House)! he said in his West Miami hometown in December to wild cheers. He pledged to have a cafetera -- a stovetop coffee-making pot used to make Cuban espresso. A month later, at another Miami event, Rubio said in English: There will be Bustelo in the White House! And a caja china for Christmas! And dominoes on Friday night. A presidential humidor!

A few days later, in New Hampshire, Cruz got in on the act, but without the Spanish. Mark your calendars now, Cruz said, Christmas Eve 2017, we are going to have a pig roast on the south lawn of the WH.

Ahead of Thursdays debate in Miami, Cruz is making a play for some Florida votes by holding a campaign event Wednesday morning at Miami-Dade College. He hasnt set up the campaign infrastructure in the county or state the way Rubio has.

But Florida isnt a must-win for Cruz, whos comfortably in second place in the race for Republican delegates nationwide. Cruzs decision to campaign in Florida concerns Rubios backers and opponents of Trump because, polls indicate, Cruz likely syphons votes from Rubio from Miami to the Panhandle. And that would help deliver the states 99 winner-take-all delegates to the front-runner.

At least in Florida, a vote for anyone but Marco is a vote for Trump, said Mauricio Claver-Carone, an influential exile-community voice who writes for the Capitol Hill Cubans blog and is the executive director of the US-Cuba Democracy PAC.

In his private capacity, Claver-Carone endorsed Rubio recently in a blast email sent to about 1,000 influential Cuban-Americans and those sympathetic to anti-Castro policies. He said he likes Cruz, but has appreciated Rubios longstanding hard-line position on Cuba more. Through the Cuba Democracy Public Advocacy committee, Claver-Carone independently funded the radio spot featuring Chirino.

The recent burst of Spanish-language campaigning and renewed focus on Miami-Dade has pleasantly surprised those who feared Rubio hadnt been doing enough early on to turn out voters.

Rubios internal polling must show he needs a big Miami turnout to have a shot at this, said Sasha Tirador, a Miami-Dade Republican political consultant who favored Bush but now backs Rubio. Who would have thought the road to the White House for Marco would run through Hialeah?",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Kim Kardashian in nude selfie war after Kanye-esque tweets,['Blanche Johnson'],"Kim Kardashian surprised fans when she took to Twitter on Tuesday and slammed Bette Midler, Chloe Grace Moretz and Piers Morgan for their comments about a nude snapshot she shared.

Kardashians harsh jabs had her followers wondering if her notoriously hot-headed husband Kanye West was speaking out on her behalf, but the reality star insists the venomous tweets were all from her.

Wait I can't believe people thought Kanye or Khloe hacked my Twitter. I swear I'm funny too!!!  Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) March 8, 2016

The revelation begs the question: Is Wests erratic and bizarre behavior is rubbing off on Kardashian?

Lindsey Carnett, PR expert, expects Kim and Kanyes behavior and Twitter rants are something that the public has to get used to.

Weve heard the term misery loves company, she said. People who complain or rant are made for each other. Think of observing couples who have been married for years go on outings wearing the same color sweater with khaki pants. Be prepared to see Kimye evolve as they grow closer. These impulsive Twitter behaviors are just the beginning of whats yet to come. They are a sociologists dream couple.

And Kardashians new need to speak out didnt end with her tweets.

The star also took to her blog to defend her selfies and even her sex tape from 2003.

I don't do drugs, I hardly drink, I've never committed a crimeand yet I'm a bad role model for being proud of my body? she wrote. I lived through the embarrassment and fear, and decided to say who cares, do better, move on. I shouldn't have to constantly be on the defense, listing off my accomplishments just to prove that I am more than something that happened 13 years ago. Let's move on, already. I have.

Ultimately, pop culture expert Cate Meighan doesnt believe Kims Kanye-inspired behavior will help her in the long run.

She wasn't exactly the favorite Kardashian sister before and being vicious isn't going to make her so either, she explained. While slut-shaming has become a huge issue, I just don't feel like it's the bottom line in this instance. I lean instead towards the idea that maybe after numerous naked selfies and magazine photo shoots it has just gotten a bit stale. Kim's wardrobe, hair and empire has evolved and so maybe people would like to see what she can do besides dropping her clothes in front of a bathroom mirror.

The 35-year-old ended her blog post with a message similar to what Kardashian fans are used to hearing the family preach.

It's 2016. The body-shaming and slut-shamingit's like, enough is enough. I will not live my life dictated by the issues you have with my sexuality. You be you and let me be me.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,9 things no one ever tells you about climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro,['Jo Piazza'],"When my husband-to-be asked what I wanted to do for our honeymoon, I was stumped. Im a travel editor. Id traveled all over the world. Wed met in the Galapagos. How do you top that? Do you even try?

We both love adventure and the outdoors, and we wanted a once-in-a-lifetime trip that would leave us with a sense of accomplishment, not just a tan.

Then one night it hit me: Well climb a mountain! What better way to start a marriage than by scaling a high peak together? How symbolic. I paused and added, What mountain can we climb without a lot of training or ropes?

Related Image Expand / Contract Massive fluctuations in temperature demand wool hats and athletic shorts. (Nick Aster)

There are plenty of mountains where you can do that in the U.S.; Colorado alone is filled with them. But this was our honeymoon, and we wanted to get away, far away, to a land without cell service. All the way to Tanzania.

Mt. Kilimanjaro, the tallest and most recognizable mountain in Africa, fit the bill. It takes hikers through five different ecosystems  from rainforest to alpine desert to arctic snowcap  and climbing 19,340 feet to the top is one of the most empowering adventures you can experience without serious training.

About 35,000 people begin the climb each year. How many reach the summit is an elusive statistic.

Related Image Expand / Contract Marching into the alpine desert. (Nick Aster)

We hooked up with the adventure travel company Intrepid, because it has a wide variety of dates for different climbs and a good track record for getting people to the top.

Kili climbs take anywhere from five to nine days, depending on your route and how much time you want to take to acclimate to the altitude. All tourists must register at the base and climb with a licensed guide. And at a cost of several thousand dollars, this isnt something you do on a whim. This is one for the bucket list.

I researched the climb before we left, but there are things I know now that I wish Id known before I got there. They would have made the climb easier, more enjoyable and less uncomfortable.

1. Kilimanjaro is hard work. The literature describes it as a walk, but just because you don't need special equipment doesn't mean its easy. Parts of the trail are very steep and feel like they go on forever. There are sections filled with 2-foot-high boulders that feel like a StairMaster on level 27.

2. Nothing on the mountain will kill you. Except lack of oxygen, which is why you need to acclimate to the altitude. But I wish Id known we were safe during our first night in an A-frame hut at the Mandara camp. There is an animal that shrieks at night and sounds like it could tear you from limb to limb. Its a harmless tree hyrax  no bigger than a cat  but I promise it will keep you from getting up to use the bathroom in the middle of the night.

Related Image Expand / Contract Walking sticks are a must-have accessory to save your hips and knees from wicked pain. (Nick Aster)

3. Toilet paper is currency. I stole a large role of extra-soft toilet paper from the last hotel I stayed in when I was told, at the last minute, that we needed to carry our own TP. And because I had it, I was all of a sudden rich. People would trade candy bars, ibuprofen and, in one case, a delicious block of cheese just for something soft to wipe with. There are bathrooms  long drop toilets  at the camp on Kilimanjaro, but they arent stocked with any amenities, including toilet paper. By the way, the only place to go while youre hiking is in the bushes, often with a crowd of tourists watching you and waving. Our Intrepid guide, Justaz Molel, described them as LWVs  Loos With a View. The problem was the view often went both ways.

4. Your sweat will freeze. And its gross. The temperatures reach over 80 degrees Fahrenheit during the day and sink to below zero at night, and its unlikely youll take a shower during the approximately six days youll be on the mountain. You may find a shower at one of the camps, but the water will be frigid. Better to remain dirty and very, very smelly.

5. Its not always easy on a relationship. Many of the guides will laugh when you tell them youre doing this on your honeymoon. While some couples find the climb empowering, others actually break up on the mountain. We heard that one honeymooning husband left his new wife alone on the mountain because the climb caused them to fight so much.

6. You need to slow down. Your guides want you to go pole pole  Swahili for slow. Its in their best interest, because youll give them good reviews if you make it to the top and avoid altitude sickness. But other members of your group may have a different definition of slow. When you start a climb, there is intense peer pressure to stay with the group. Our group was composed of very active, very adventurous Australians, and trying to keep up with them made me weep on our first day. I also felt like the mountain passed me by. I hardly remembered anything except staring at my feet, willing them to go faster as my breath grew more ragged. On our second day, one of our guides saw how much I was hurting, grabbed my shoulders and said, Pole, pole. While the rest of the group sped ahead, I slowed down. Not only did I feel better, but I noticed things like glacial streams rushing over boulders, chameleons hiding in the branches and butterflies as big as your hand with perfect white polka dots.

7. There are a lot of senior citizens on the mountain. This is either inspiring or, if you are huffing and puffing your way up, incredibly demoralizing. I chose to feel empowered. Look, honey, I said to my husband. If we stay quite fit we can do this again in 30 years. I didnt get a response.

8. It is one of the most beautiful places youll ever be. So much of the literature talks about the physical aspect of the climb, about pushing yourself to your limits. It talks about the gorgeous view from Uhuru, the summit of Kibo peak. But what we dont hear enough is that the entire climb is beautiful and other-worldly. So many climbers were so focused on Uhuru, they hardly noticed Mwenzi, the craggy second peak of Kilimanjaro that looms ominously over climbers, since it is near-impossible to climb. They dont frolic through the willowy elephant grass or take the extra hour to look at some of the clearest night skies in the world.

Related Image Expand / Contract The real treat is enjoying a sunrise high above the clouds. (Nick Aster)

9. You can be in the best shape of your life and fail to reach the summit. Altitude sickness is an equal opportunity bully. You may be able to run marathons, but the vomiting, nausea and sometimes hallucinations can knock you out well before you reach 19,000 feet. My husband and I are youngish and in good shape. I run almost every day and he goes rock climbing twice a week. Still, altitude sickness was not our friend. We had to bail at 16,000 feet with headaches and nausea worse than any hangover. My husband imagined he saw fish flopping on rocks in the alpine desert. We had to go down or risk serious illness.

Would knowing these tips have somehow changed that? Maybe. Would I do the climb again, knowing we wouldnt make it to the very, very top? Absolutely.",[]

Performance Sports Group (PSG), the owner of recognizable brands such as Easton and Bauer, lost more than half its value on Tuesday after slashing its outlook. The maker of baseball bats and hockey skates cited a loss of sales to Sports Authority, in addition to a weak baseball and softball market. Meanwhile, Dicks Sporting Goods (DKS)Americas largest sporting-goods chainwarned that Sports Authoritys liquidation sales could sway customers heading into the spring.

PSG is forecasting adjusted earnings of 12 cents to 14 cents a share in fiscal 2016, down from a previously expected 66 cents to 69 cents a share. Shares tumbled 67% before recovering as much as 14% on Wednesday. Over the last 52 weeks, PSGs stock has declined 82%.

The industry has grappled with slow sales for sports equipment, although participation rates are climbing. According to a survey from the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, participation in team sports saw the most upbeat marks in 2015. Baseball, ice hockey, lacrosse, indoor soccer and both flag and tackle football posted growth of at least 4% year-over-year.

We have not seen issues in participation, President of PSG Brands Amir Rosenthal said on an earnings call. Rather, PSG noted that product demand has shifted and some of its retail partners have consolidated in recent months.

Sports Authority is just the most recent victim of a competitive sporting goods market. Four of PSGs top seven U.S. hockey retailers consolidated over the past several months, which reduced demand faster than the company previously anticipated. Team Express, an online baseball retailer and another PSG customer, declared bankruptcy in 2015. City Sports, a regional chain, sought Chapter 11 protection last year, too.

PSG suggested that Sports Authoritys downfall has created uncertainty for other retailers.

Online court records show he was charged Wednesday in Montgomery County, Missouri, in the death of 49-year-old Randy Nordman. Nordman was shot Tuesday at his rural home near New Florence, about 70 miles west of St. Louis.

Serrano-Vitorino is also charged with four counts of first-degree murder in Kansas. Authorities there say he gunned down a neighbor and three other men late Monday before fleeing. Investigators haven't discussed a possible motive for the attacks.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said in a statement late Tuesday that Serrano-Vitorino was a Mexican national who was held at the Overland Park, Kan. Municipal Court on Sept. 14. The fingerprinting generated an ICE detainer, but the agency was erroneously issued...to the Johnson County Sheriffs Office, instead of the Overland Park Municipal Court.

The Department of Homeland Security said that Serrano-Vitorino was released from custody without ICE being notified, though they did not elaborate on why. ICE also confirmed that Serrano-Vitorino had been deported back to Mexico in 2004, but had since returned illegally.

It was not clear when he returned to the U.S.

The widespread manhunt for him, which started Monday, included helicopters, police dogs and at least one SWAT team. One of the four men shot that day managed to call police before he died, but it's unclear how the men knew each other or what may have prompted the shooting, Kansas City police officer Thomas Tomasic said.

A truck Serrano-Vitorino was believed to be driving was found about 7 a.m. Tuesday morning alongside Interstate-70 in central Missouri.

About 25 minutes later, sheriff's deputies responded to a shooting about 5 miles away at a Montgomery County home and found the body of 49-year-old Nordman, according to the patrol.

Highway Patrol Lt. Paul Reinsch said a witness who called 911 reported seeing a man running from Nordman's property, launching a manhunt of that area.

Reinsch said investigators weren't aware of any connection between Serrano-Vitorino and Nordman, whose home is near his family's campground and a racetrack for remote-controlled cars.

Police have not released the names of the four victims, but relatives identified three of them to the Kansas City Star as Mike Capps and brothers Clint and Austin Harter.

The death was one of six killings on a violent Tuesday in the city.

The violence began in the afternoon when police say a 55-year-old man entered a Cricket Wireless store and stabbed a man in the chest who was paying his bill. The man then fled and climbed into a car and stabbed the driver in each hand. Police say the man, who hasn't been identified, headed to a nearby mechanic and stabbed a 30-year-old man in the chest who was watching repairs on his car. Police say that man collapsed in the road and later died from his injuries.

The two other victims drove themselves to a hospital and were in stable condition. The suspect was taken into custody, still holding the knife, but has not been charged.

He is perhaps the last American not of Syrian origin living in the capital, after the United States closed its embassy and urged citizens to leave the country in 2012. The Czech Embassy, which has handled U.S. interests since then, told him to be careful.

""Foreigners were being kidnapped at the time,"" Webber says of the chaotic period four years ago. ""I guess I don't look like a Syrian. I'm a little bit taller than most.""

At 6 feet 4 inches, he is a lot taller than most, and his silver hair and bespoke suits  complete with pocket squares  also make him stand out. But policemen at nearby checkpoints wave him on with a smile, and he stands by his decision to stay.

""The Syrian people are just the most beautiful people in the world,"" he says. ""There's no way I'm going to leave this country. They're going to have to carry me out.""

He said that when the Czech Embassy contacted him, urging him to leave, it told him he was the last American not of Syrian origin still living in Damascus. An official at the Czech embassy in Damascus contacted by The Associated Press said he could not confirm whether that was the case.

Webber was born and raised in Orchard Park, New York, a suburb of Buffalo. His father was a German railyard master and his mother was a Polish nurse. He flunked out of dental school, skipped the Vietnam draft due to a technical error, and was living in California when he was offered a job teaching science at Damascus Community School, a private American academy.

""I said OK, and then headed to the public library and got out an atlas,"" he recalls.

He arrived in Damascus in 1975, and went on to convert to Islam and marry a Syrian woman. Except for a brief stint teaching in Iran, he has lived in Syria ever since. Today he has three grown children, 11 grandchildren and a great grandchild living in various countries. He visits them often, but always comes home to Damascus.

Syria has been hostile to Israel and to U.S. policies in the region for as long as Webber has been there, but thousands of Americans and other Westerners, including diplomats, teachers, businesspeople and clergy members, called it home. And the country was a relatively safe destination for American tourists, students and other visitors.

That began to change in 2011, after Syrians rose up with mostly peaceful protests demanding political change. President Bashar Assad responded with a brutal crackdown, an insurgency erupted, and soon the country was in the grip of a full-blown civil war that has now killed more than 250,000 people.

In the chaotic early months of the conflict foreigners fled, fearing kidnappings and bombings. The government has maintained a tight grip on the capital, with security checkpoints at almost every intersection, but insurgents have lobbed mortar rounds into the city center from suburbs under their control.

""One hit about 3 meters in front of our door,"" Webber said calmly. ""Wiped out seven cars.""

He and his wife began taking ""strong precautionary measures,"" he said. ""When I went out by myself I told her where I was going, and same with her. When I'm driving, I am very observant of cars around me. We started doing a lot more things together, which is good for our relationship,"" he added cheerfully.

The security situation in the capital has improved since then, and over the past week a U.S. and Russian-brokered cease-fire has brought about the first major lull in the fighting.

On a recent day, Webber walked up the stone steps of the botanical garden cafe in the Old City, greeted the waiter and took a table on the rooftop, which offers a panoramic view of the old citadel. Nestled between the Barada River and the entrance to the famed Umayyad Mosque, the garden offers birdsong and quiet tranquility in the heart of a busy city, and seems a world apart from the war.

Webber recently wrote about it on TripAdvisor, where he is a level 6 contributor. He has written more than 300 reviews on the site, trumpeting Syria's famed restaurants and attractions.

""I have the choice of any country, including America, and I choose to stay here,"" he says. ""It's part of my heart now.""

Many of his friends have left, and a landscaping business he founded is suffering. But the exodus of qualified teachers made it easy to get a part-time job in the English department of a local high school. Several times a week, Webber shares his love of Charles Dickens with teenagers from the French-speaking Lycee Charles de Gaulle.

""I feel 45 years old again after a good day of teaching,"" he said.

Most Damascenes place little stock in the cease-fire, and fear the shelling may soon resume. But Webber  ever the optimist  thinks the peace will hold, and after spending four decades immersed in Arab culture, he has taken on its belief in divine providence.

""My wife agrees with me on this  when it's your time, it's your time. I could leave school and slip on a banana peel and die,"" he said, folding his arms. ""It's God's will.""",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Sanders upsets Clinton in Michigan; Trump notches three more wins,[],"Bernie Sanders pulled off a shocking upset in Michigan's Democratic primary Tuesday night, beating Hillary Clinton in a race that most polls had him trailing by double digits and eclipsing the front runner's earlier win in Mississippi.

Republican front-runner Donald Trump, meanwhile, regained any momentum lost last weekend against challenger Ted Cruz, sweeping to convincing victories in Michigan and Mississippi while sending a message to the Republican establishment to jump on board  or get out of the way.

Cruz was projected to pick up a win in the Idaho GOP primary, while Trump was projected to easily win the Hawaii Republican caucus.

But Trump's earlier victories were more valuable in terms of delegates. And Tuesday's results may also seal the fate of Marco Rubio, who appeared once again to finish the night failing to gain any delegates.

Cruz appeared to have beaten John Kasich for second place in Michigan by approximately 8,000 votes. Kasich is counting on a win in his home state of Ohio next week to salvage his campaign.

On the Democratic side, Clinton easily won Mississippis primary earlier Tuesday, thanks in part to her overwhelming support from black voters, and likely will pick up more delegates in Tuesdays contests than Sanders.

But the Vermont senators surprising Michigan win could give him a bounce as he and the rest of the candidates charge into the vital March 15 primaries in Florida, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina.

Michigan is the ninth and largest state that Sanders has won so far in the Democratic presidential campaign. All 15 pre-election polls in Michigan this year showed Clinton leading Sanders by double digits.

For his part, Trump is looking to March 15 to sideline the rest of the GOP field for good  something he tried to start doing Tuesday night. At a press conference at his golf club in Juniper, Fla., he said of his remaining rivals, Theyre pretty much all gone.

Michigan was the biggest prize of the four states that voted Tuesday.

On the Republican side in Mississippi, Trump defeated Cruz by 47 percent to 36 percent of the vote, with Kasich a distant third at 9 percent and Rubio garnering just 5 percent of the vote.

Trump celebrated his wins at a lengthy press conference Tuesday night, teasing the special interests and others that ran ads against him.

It shows you how brilliant the public is, because they knew they were lies, Trump said.

He started his victory talk with a subdued and conciliatory tone, appearing to take the first steps to patch up any differences with the party brass. He noted House Speaker Paul Ryan recently called him.

He could not have been nicer, Trump said.

But he soon slipped into his standard fare, making cracks about his remaining rivals. He took a shot at Cruz, noting the Texas senator positions himself as the only candidate who can beat him, but he never beats me.

Both Trump and Clinton had a mixed performance this past weekend where they effectively split the delegate field with their top rivals.

The stakes on Tuesday arguably were higher for Trump, whose delegate lead over Cruz shrunk on Saturday as they each won two contests. Cruz has been pushing to consolidate conservative support on the heels of those races, arguing Trump is not the candidate he claims to be.

He is pretending to be an outsider, Cruz told Fox News.

But Trump used his wins Tuesday to downplay the chances for his remaining rivals, as he and the rest of the field look ahead to next weeks vital winner-take-all contests in Ohio and Florida.

I think were going to do really well in Florida, he said. Its my second home.

Kasich, who campaigned in Michigan Tuesday, told Fox News he was focusing on the Midwestern states  and repeated his vow to win Ohio.

Rubio, too, is looking for a comeback win in his home state next week, all the while battling calls from his rivals to drop out. But Trump leads in the Florida polls, and Rubio endured another disappointing night in Tuesday's contests.

Looking ahead, Rubio rallied a home-state crowd Tuesday evening, saying: I believe with all my heart that the winner of the Florida primary next Tuesday will be the nominee of the Republican Party. ... And I need your help. I need your vote.

Clinton, meanwhile, is still trying to regain her footing as Sanders has demonstrated his grassroots support in several recent contests. Over the weekend, he claimed three victories to Clintons one.

Thanks in part, though, to so-called superdelegates  party leaders and officials free to support whomever they want  Clinton maintains a huge delegate lead over Sanders. She had 1,221 to Sanders 571, as of early Wednesday morning.

Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri stressed Tuesday that their campaigns strategy focuses on winning delegates, and told Fox News theyll pick up more delegates than Sanders from Tuesdays contests regardless of the Michigan results.

On the GOP side, Trump leads Cruz in the delegate count 446 to 347, with Rubio trailing at 151 and Kasich at 54, as of early Wednesday morning.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Rep. Diane Black: An open letter to Amy Brenneman on abortion,['Diane Black'],"Dear Amy,

I read with interest your February 29th column in Cosmopolitan magazine about your personal experience with abortion. While we approach this sensitive issue from different viewpoints, I thank you for sharing your story. I agree that women, regardless of their opinion, should talk honestly about this matter. I also know that some who, like me, identify as pro-life and oppose abortion have not always conveyed that opinion with the compassion and empathy that should be afforded to this topic on both sides of the debate, and for that I am sorry.

Like you, I know what it is like to be single, pregnant, and uncertain of what the future holds.

I was carrying my youngest child to term when my first husband left me amid the demons of alcoholism.

Later, in my career as an emergency room nurse, I met other young women in this same precarious position. I believe that the pro-life community has a responsibility to those women. It is why I have long supported the work of my local crisis local pregnancy center and other nonprofits that offer real, tangible help to women in this very situation  everything from diapers and formula to counseling and prayer.

I want you to know that I agree with you on the need to defend every womans right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. As you and I know, this has not historically been the case and I am keenly aware of those whose shoulders I now stand on as a woman who cannot only vote but can also serve in Congress.

I want every young girl, including my two granddaughters, to be able to  as you say  choose their destiny. I believe that protecting those rights, however, starts with protecting the most foundational right of all: the right of a preborn, human being with a beating heart to see the light of day. A young woman cannot choose her destiny if her life is cut short in the womb.

When we frame abortion as a means of female empowerment, we dont tell the full story. Indeed, studies show that abortions worldwide disproportionately impacts baby girls. Consider a 2012 report in Britains Daily Telegraph on abortion practices in India, where there are believed to be as many as eight million cases of female sex-selective abortion over the last decade, a phenomenon that is now affecting the countrys overall gender ratio.

I say this not to shame any woman who has made the difficult decision to have an abortion but rather in hopes of raising the consciousness of this nation so we can enact needed protections for these members of the human family.

Specific to your concerns on the Texas abortion law now in question before the United States Supreme Court in the case of Whole Womans Health vs. Hellerstedt, I readily admit my own bias. That said, I believe the standards you call onerous and unnecessary to be quite modest.

As you know, the disputed Texas law has two key provisions. First, it requires abortionists to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles so that a patient receiving an abortion can be quickly transferred in the event of complications and, secondly, it requires abortion clinics to abide by the same safety standards and licensing requirements as other outpatient surgery centers in the state. To be clear, the law does not attempt to illegalize abortion at any stage of pregnancy.

I passionately believe in protecting the unborn, but I also believe equal attention must be devoted to protecting their mothers. While I disagree with the choice of abortion, I do not believe any woman should lose her life at the hands of an unregulated, unsafe abortion clinic or a fly-by-night abortion doctor. That is what this law aims to prevent.

It is my hope that womens advocates  and you are certainly a needed and influential one  will take a deeper look at this law and applaud these commonsense standards rather than attempt to turn back the clock and strip them away.

Sincerely,

Diane Black

The driver immediately opened fire, Hackney said, hitting the detective in the head, upper body and hand. The detective was out of surgery Wednesday afternoon and in critical but ""more stable condition.""

The suspect, who has not yet been identified, ran away from the shooting scene and stole a large flatbed truck from a nearby business, Hackney said.

The detective, whose 14-year-old son was in the car but unharmed, managed to call for help.

The officers located the truck and pursued it into a nearby neighborhood, where it crashed into a house. The man ran into the backyard and two officers found the suspect holding a gun. They ordered him to drop it, Hackney said, and when he didn't, the suspect was shot four times. He survived and is in custody.

The officers who fired are on administrative leave.

It was unclear why the detective had his vest on while off duty. Hackney said narcotics detectives often carry their bullet-proof vests in the car with them because they can be called into work at any time.

He met one-on-one with the FOX Business Networks Maria Bartiromo to discuss Apples device default encryption, first implemented with iOS 8, which ensures that a third-party has no way to access your information.

The conversation was particularly important to Vance Jr. as the office of the DA in Manhattan has several phones it needs access to in order to close out cases involving drug peddlers.

Since October 2014, when Apple re-engineered its phones so they could not be open with a court order judicial warrant, we now have 205 cases just in our cyber lab alone, [that] do not take into account the NYPDs, for which weve gotten search warrants from a judge but we cannot access because of this device default encryption that Apple has installed, Vance Jr. explained.



The Manhattan DA believes the U.S. Senate and Congress need to exercise their responsibility to find the middle ground between public safety and privacy.

Apple speaks on behalf of its customers. I want Apple to speak on behalf of the customers who are victims of crimes who may not have a path toward justice because we cannot access to the information necessary to do our job, said Vance Jr.

A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC poll shows Americans are divided on the debate between privacy and national security.

When grizzlies were added to the list in 1975, there were just 136 bears remaining in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (which includes both the park and surrounding lands) as a result of hunting.

Today, there are an estimated 700 to 1,000 bears. ""There is robust agreement that this population has recovered,"" Service Director Dan Ashe says. ""It's now our obligation to delist the population and return management to the state."" A final decision is expected later this year, reports Reuters.

Grizzlies have also doubled their range to occupy more than 22,500 square miles of the Yellowstone region, but wildlife advocates fear they're still at risk. A record 59 Yellowstone grizzlies died last year as food sources, including white bark pine and cutthroat trout, dwindled.

The proposal comes ""a couple years too early,"" says one advocate, who fears that Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana will resume grizzly hunts, not held since 1974, on bears who stray beyond the park's boundaries.

A scientist with the National Resources Defense Council tells CNN that the bears could see genetic problems if they don't interact with bears outside the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

Ashe says a five-year plan will be put in place to ""ensure healthy grizzly populations persist across the Yellowstone ecosystem long into the future.""

White has said that Rousey would get the first crack at Tate's new title when she's ready to return to action later this year.

Yes, he holds a no-trade clause on a contract that can go through 2019. But the 31-year-old forward appears to be increasingly frustrated with New York's on-court performance and off-court leadership.

Last week, he called team owner James Dolan out to a heckling fan and was later forced to issue an apology. A little while later, Anthony wondered aloud why his peers -- LeBron James, Chris Paul and Dwyane Wade -- have had more success in their careers.

But, apparently, Anthony doesn't want out of the Big Apple. No. Instead, he's interested in recruiting free agents to the Knicks (via ESPN):

""Put me at the head of the table, and let's go to work,"" Anthony told reporters after the Knicks' practice Monday in Denver. The Knicks will have at least $18 million in cap space this summer, and Anthony wants to sell free agents on what it's like to play in New York. ""If we want this team to be better, if we want more pieces of this team, I don't have a choice but to go out there and do my job and try to get people to come,"" he said. ""And for them to see it from my perspective [more] than anybody else's perspective -- see it from a player's perspective.""

Given everything that's transpired over the past few weeks, this is odd. Anthony has publicly stated his desire to win in New York numerous times, but the franchise's trajectory doesn't call for much success in the immediate future. Even if they sign Sacramento Kings point guard Rajon Rondo, who Anthony cites by name in the article, the Knicks probably still don't even make the playoffs next season.

Carmelo says Rondo would be great in the triangle offense. Melo said he will be doing a lot of recruiting this summer.  Al Iannazzone (@Al_Iannazzone) March 7, 2016

If Arron Afflalo and Derrick Williams both opt out of their contracts, New York will have enough cap space to sign a max contract, but so will over half the league -- from a free agency pool that isn't very attractive.

It's best for everyone involved that Melo moves on, accepts a trade and lets New York rebuild around rookie phenom Kristaps Porzingis. If Anthony isn't traded this summer, the Knicks risk him declining and permanently damaging his market value.

Forget about short-term relief, this franchise needs to finally start thinking big picture.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,"Conor McGregor faces no medical suspension, cleared to return ASAP",[],"All four fighters in the main and co-main events put on a show at UFC 196, but after nearly seven rounds of action with a lot of blood, sweat and tears being shed, no one will face a lengthy medical suspension from the card on Saturday night.

The Nevada State Athletic Commission confirmed the medical suspensions with FOX Sports on Tuesday and out of the four main event fighters only Nate Diaz will face any kind of time off.

Diaz was suspended until 4/20 -- yes, seriously April 20 -- due to a facial laceration suffered in the fight with McGregor. Diaz also got a no-contact order until April 5 as a result of the fight.

Despite a hard-fought two rounds with Diaz, McGregor will actually face no medical suspension at all after losing by submission in the second round due to a rear naked choke.

Since McGregor faces no mandated time off, he would be cleared to return to action as soon as he wanted to book his next fight, with UFC 200 being the most likely landing spot.

McGregor stated after his loss that he planned to move back down to the featherweight division to defend his title with either Jose Aldo or Frankie Edgar as the most likely candidate for an opponent.

As for Miesha Tate and Holly Holm, they went to war during their fight over nearly five rounds, but thankfully neither fighter suffered any significant damage. Neither Tate or Holm was issued any kind of medical suspension, which clears the way for a return to action sooner rather than later.

The full list of medical suspensions for UFC 196 listed below:

Nate Diaz suspended until 4/20/16, no contact until 4/5/16 due to a laceration over his right eye.

foxnews.com,2016-02-12 00:00:00,"Neanderthal-human trysts may be linked to modern depression, heart disease",[],"Ancient trysts between Neanderthals and modern humans may have influenced modern risks for depression, heart attacks, nicotine addiction, obesity and other health problems, researchers said.

The Neanderthals were once the closest relatives of modern humans. Scientists recently discovered that Neanderthals and modern humans once interbred; nowadays, about 1.5 to 2.1 percent of DNA in people outside Africa is Neanderthal in origin.

""This raises several fascinating questions like, 'What effect does the Neanderthal DNA that remains in modern humans have on our biology?'"" said study senior author John Capra, an evolutionary geneticist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. [See Photos of Our Closest Human Ancestor]

Now, for the first time, researchers have directly compared Neanderthal DNA with the clinical records of a significant portion of adults of European ancestry. The scientists discovered that this archaic genetic legacy has had a subtle but significant impact on modern human biology, they said.

""Neanderthal DNA influences a broad range of traits relevant to disease risk in modern humans,"" Capra told Live Science.

The researchers first identified about 135,000 Neanderthal genetic variations found in modern humans. Next, the scientists analyzed a database of more than 28,000 adults of European ancestry from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, a consortium of nine hospitals across the United States. This data linked patient genetic data with versions of those individuals' electronic health records that were stripped of identifying details such as names and addresses.

The data helped the researchers determine if each person had ever been treated for medical conditions such as heart disease, arthritis and depression. It also helped the scientists determine what Neanderthal genetic variants each person carried.

Ultimately, the researchers found that Neanderthal genetic variants were significantly linked to increased risk of 12 traits, including heart attack and artery thickening.

Surprisingly, the investigators also found a Neanderthal genetic variant that significantly increased the modern human risk for nicotine addiction, the researchers said. However, this does not mean that Neanderthals smoked tobacco, Capra said.

""Tobacco was found solely in the Western Hemisphere until Europeans brought it back from expeditions to the Americas,"" Capra said. The Neanderthal DNA that boosts the risk of nicotine addiction may have had a completely different and potentially beneficial effect ""that exhibited itself 50,000 years ago,"" Capra said.

Some of the scientists' discoveries confirm previous ideas. For example, earlier research suggested that Neanderthal DNA influenced skin cells known as keratinocytes that help protect the skin from environmental damage such as ultraviolet radiation and germs. The new findings suggest that Neanderthal genetic variants increase the risk of developing sun-triggered skin lesions known as keratoses, which are caused by abnormal keratinocytes.

""When we started this study, we expected that if we found anything at all, we would find an influence of Neanderthal DNA on bodily systems that are involved in interactions with the environment,"" Capra said. ""We hypothesized this because Neanderthals had been living in Central Asia and Europe for hundreds of thousands of years before our recent ancestors ever reached these areas  and thus had likely adapted to the distinct environmental aspects of these regions, compared to Africa, in terms of climate, plants and animals, and pathogens.""

Capra and his colleagues also found that a number of Neanderthal genetic variants influenced the risk for depression, with some variants increasing the risk and others reducing it.

""The brain is incredibly complex, so it's reasonable to expect that introducing changes from a different evolutionary path might have negative consequences,"" study lead author Corinne Simonti, a graduate student of human genetics at Vanderbilt University, said in a statement.""

The researchers suggest that some Neanderthal genetic variants might have provided benefits in modern human populations as they first moved out of Africa thousands of years ago. However, those variants may have later become detrimental in modern, Western environments, the scientists said. One example is Neanderthal DNA that increases blood clotting; while this can help seal wounds and prevent germs from entering the body, it can also increase the risk for stroke, miscarriage and other problems, Capra said.

The researchers suggest that Neanderthal DNA may not have contributed to differences in skin colors between modern humans, unlike what previous research has suggested. Instead, differences in modern human skin color probably developed very recently, Capra said. ""Neanderthals may also have had a range of skin colors,"" Capra added.

Future research can compare Neanderthal DNA with data gleaned from other sources of medical information, such as lab tests, doctors' notes and medical images, the researchers said. ""There is still much to learn about the effects of interbreeding on different populations in recent human history,"" Capra said.

The scientists detailed their findings online Feb. 11 in the journal Science.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Sanders camp sees opportunity as Southern state voting wraps,[],"Bernie Sanders is showing no signs of slowing down after pulling off an upset victory in Michigan and sees an opportunity ahead to gain ground, as his campaign suggests one of Hillary Clintons biggest built-in advantages is about to become irrelevant.

To date, Clintons firewall of Southern states has delivered her a string of victories, most recently in Mississippi. Across the Deep South, black voters who make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate there went overwhelmingly for Clinton.

But after Florida and North Carolina hold primaries next Tuesday, the Southern states are done voting. The map shifts to the Midwest and beyond  and in those states, the black voting bloc is not so large.

Sanders, who closed what virtually every pre-election poll showed was a double-digit deficit against Clinton in Michigan, made clear after his surprise victory that hes looking to repeat that success in other Rust Belt states starting next week.

We look forward to going to Illinois, Ohio, Missouri and the other states, Sanders told reporters.

Sanders upset win in Michigan could fuel tensions Wednesday night at a debate being held at Miami Dade College.

The two already were meeting with their manners in question. The competitors cranked through their previous face-off just days earlier and emerged complaining of disrespectful conduct.

Now, Sanders sees an opening and Clinton is more determined than ever to clear him out of the way.

Sanders campaign officials made the case Tuesday night that the Vermont senators attacks on Clintons support for free trade deals had an impact in the Michigan race, and likely will be effective in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri. And they maintained that Clintons advantage in the South goes away after next Tuesday, as rural voters in other states, including the West, taking a closer look at their candidate.

Among the upcoming contests are Utah, Idaho, Arizona and Washington state.

To date, Clinton has been helped immensely by her dominating performance in Southern states, where minority voters overwhelmingly broke for her.

And thanks to their support  and just as important, the support of unpledged superdelegates -- Clinton still enjoys a huge overall delegate lead. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri stressed Tuesday that their campaigns strategy focuses on winning delegates, and noted theyd pick up more delegates than Sanders from Tuesdays contests regardless of the Michigan results.

As of Wednesday afternoon, Clinton had 1,221 delegates to Sanders 571. The former secretary of states advantage remains daunting for her insurgent rival.

Even as Sanders looks to the Midwest and West for support, both campaigns will compete next week for Florida, where polls show Clinton well ahead.

But before those delegates are at play, Clinton and Sanders will meet for their eighth debate in the Sunshine State where 99 Democratic delegates are at stake, as well as bragging rights in the most hotly contested battleground in U.S. politics.

Floridians have picked President Obama in the past two elections, and former President George W. Bush twice before that. The Sunshine State is also home to the infamous hanging chad election drama of 2000, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided the race in Bushs favor.

Wednesdays one-on-one will be hosted by Univision News and The Washington Post, and aired on CNN.

Coming less than 24 hours after Sanders Michigan win, the debate gives both candidates a chance to make their case to a key voting demographic  the Latino community  and tackle controversial issues like immigration reform and border security.

Clinton is expected to press Sanders on his comment from their last debate which critics said made it sound as though only non-whites live in poverty. When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto, you don't know what it's like to be poor, he said.

Sanders, who has tried to make inroads with black voters, sought to mop up after the debate by saying he only meant that many white people aren't aware of the pressures and police oppression facing black Americans.

He also bristled: ""I don't want to be lectured about talking poverty whether it's white, black, Latino. Nobody in this campaign has talked about it more.""

The candidates are also likely to take on police, race and gun violence.

The death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was killed in 2012 in Sanford, Fla., during an altercation with neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, remains a wound that won't heal among blacks. Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder.

Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, has campaigned with Clinton to reduce gun violence. And Clinton has gone after Sanders for voting against longer waiting periods for gun purchases.

Another prickly topic up for debate is health care.

More than 1.7 million Floridians have enrolled in Obama's health care law this year, with South Florida having one of the highest enrollment levels in the nation.

Clinton supports the law and wants to fix it. Sanders wants to push for universal health care in a government-financed system.

Former Eagles member placed on psychiatric hold,['Blanche Johnson'],"After Lana Rae Meisner, the wife of former Eagles bassist Randy Meisner, was accidentally shot and killed in the couples home Sunday night, the musician has been placed on a 72 hour psych hold.

Meisner was hospitalized shortly after the incident Sunday, and according to an attorney for Meisners friend James Newton, the musician is unreachable.

The only thing I know that I think is being widely reported right now is that he is indeed on a 72-hour [psychiatric] hold, and as far as I know, my client James Newton nor the family have been able to get through to him yet, Newtons lawyer Troy Martin told FOX411.

Newton, through his attorney, argued for Meisner to be put under conservatorship in April 2015 after a series of tumultuous incidents.

In January 2015, the former Eagles member was placed under court-ordered 24-hour supervision after allegedly threatening murder-suicide with an AK-47 and pills.

More on this... Wife of former Eagles member Randy Meisner killed in couples home

In court in April 2015, Newtons lawyer claimed Meisner was bipolar and suffered suicidal ideations.

In audio from a 911 call from this week's incident, the dispatcher is heard saying Meisner suffers from a mental disorder and is possibly armed with a BB gun. However, police have confirmed the BB gun was not connected to his wifes death.

Martin said Meisner reached out to Newton for help in recent years.

They were friends many years ago back in Nebraska and they had sort of lost contact up to a couple of years ago when Randy was at a traumatic brain rehab facility, he said. Jim had reached out to him by the phone and went out and visited him and at that point Randy asked Jim to help him...There was the conservatorship and that was Jim was attesting to help him was to try to get a professional in there to help take care of him.

The LAPD has revealed police had been to the Meisner residence earlier in the day Sunday, at 5:30 p.m., and they took a domestic violence incident report and left. Around 7 p.m. police responded to a call regarding a shooting, and Lana Rae Meisner was pronounced dead at the scene.

""Mrs. Meisner was moving a rifle that was stored inside a case in a closet,"" a press release explained. ""As she lifted the rifle in the case, another item within the case shifted and hit the trigger of the rifle causing it to fire and fatally injure Mrs. Meisner.""

Police confirmed Meisner was in another part of the house when the gun went off and he has not been charged for the crime.

Martin said those closest to Meisner are worried for his well-being.

We are very concerned with the reports that he has threatened to kill himself and so what our hope is that he will be receptive to his family being involved so they can give him the support he needs in this very difficult time.",[]

Archaeologists from the University of Sheffield identified the island at Little Carlton near Louth, Lincolnshire. It is thought the site is a previously unknown monastic or trading centre but researchers believe their work has only revealed an enticing glimpse of the settlement so far, explained the University of Sheffield, in a press release.

The Anglo-Saxon era in Britain spanned from the 5th to the 11th centuries.

The amazing Lincolnshire discovery was sparked by Graham Vickers, a local man with a metal detector who unearthed a silver stylus from a disturbed plough field. Vickers reported the find to the Portable Antiquities Scheme, which encourages the voluntary recording of archaeological objects found by members of the public.The ornate writing tool, which dates back to the 8th century, was the first of a number of items found at the site.

Artifacts found at the site now include a total of 21 styli, around 300 dress pins, and a huge number of Sceattas, which are coins from the 7th-8th centuries. A small lead tablet bearing the letters spelling the female Anglo-Saxon name Cudberg was also found.

Hugh Willmott, senior lecturer in European historical archaeology at the University of Sheffield, and Pete Townend, a doctoral student at the university, visited the site to carry out targeted geophysical surveys. The archaeologists also used measured and mapped magnetism in the soil and performed 3D modelling to visualise the landscape on a large scale.

The imagery showed that the island they had discovered was much more obvious than the land today, rising out of its lower surroundings, explained the university. To complete the picture the researchers raised the water level digitally to bring it back up to its early medieval height based on the topography and geophysical survey.

In an attempt to find out more about life at the site, University of Sheffield students opened nine evaluation trenches, which revealed items indicating that the islands may have been an Anglo-Saxon industrial area. They also found significant amounts of pottery and butchered animal bone.

But it's also settling ever so slowly on the ocean floor in the form of plankton poop.

And because plastic-laden poop is lighter and falls more slowly than poop that is free of plastic, it has more time to be eaten up by other marine life in the process, report researchers from the University of Exeter in the journal Environmental Science & Technology.

""This could be an important route by which floating plastic litter is removed from the sea surface down to the ocean depths,"" says the lead researcher of the lab experiments.

""The magnitude of change observed here is concerning."" The researchers observed zooplankton ingesting microscopic bits of plastic floating around and then pooping what is, essentially, plastic-filled feces.

Ordinarily such poop pellets help transport carbon and nutrients down to the ocean depths, but as researchers report in a press release, this plankton feces is not only not doing that, it's transporting plastic into the mouths of the marine life that ingest it as a food source.

It's unclear what this means, and whether the team's lab tests will play out in real life, but as Grist reports, ""Weve already got a serious problem on our hands, and these slow-moving, structurally unsound fecal dumbwaiters arent helping.""

(WTVR) -- A man who suffered serve injuries when his clothes caught fire after he was Tasered by a former Chesterfield County police officer has filed a $95 million lawsuit against the former officer.

SEE ALSO: US Attorney General Lynch asks not to be considered for Supreme Court vacancy

Miles November, 27, suffered the injuries after a police pursuit and crash where he was ultimately Tasered by former officer Ryan T. Swope, who is no longer with the department.

November's legal guardian filed the suit on his behalf, it alleges Swope's use of the Taser was unlawful and unjustified.

November was injured during a police chaseon February 7, 2015, when he lost control of his car and rolled it several times near Jefferson Davis Highway and Chester Road. November was then struck with a Taser when he fought with the first responders who were trying to rescue him, according to police.

After the injuries sustained during the incident, November was hospitalized from February 2015 to October 2015, according to his attorney John Shea.

Shea told CBS 6 November has undergone 35 surgeries and is still in horrible pain. His current medical bills have reached $6 million, with future bills upward of $15 to $21 million. Shea also added November will never be able to work again.

Authorities believe November's clothing came in contact with spilled gasoline, according to court documents obtained by the Richmond Times Dispatch.

""The suit alleges that after November was removed from his car, police 'did not have and could not reasonably or justifiably have had any belief that November, an unarmed crash victim whose wrecked vehicle was upside down and completely inoperable, posed any danger or threat to police officers or others which required the use of a Taser to apply a 50,000 volt electrical shock to November in the vicinity of the gasoline.'""

November was charged with felony assault of a police officer, eluding police, driving with a suspended license and third offense driving while intoxicated in relation to the Feburary 2015 incident.

Chesterfield County Police spokesperson confirmed to CBS 6 Swope is no longer with the department, but they cannot comment further due to pending litigation.

Police say a man has been charged in a stabbing rampage along a Philadelphia street in which police said he randomly attacked people at a cellphone store and inside a car and then killed a man at a mechanic shop.

The death was one of six killings on a violent Tuesday in the city.

Police said the man entered a Cricket Wireless store and stabbed a man in the chest who was paying his bill, then climbed into a car and stabbed the driver in each hand before heading to a nearby mechanic and stabbing 30-year-old Nathan Ackison in the chest as he was watching repairs on his car. Ackson was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital minutes later. The two other victims drove themselves to a hospital and were in stable condition.

Fifty-five-year-old Ronald Stanley is charged with murder, criminal homicide, aggravated and simple assault and related offenses. Court documents don't list an attorney and a listed number for him couldn't be found Wednesday.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Kim Kardashian in nude selfie war after Kanye-esque tweets,['Blanche Johnson'],"Kim Kardashian surprised fans when she took to Twitter on Tuesday and slammed Bette Midler, Chloe Grace Moretz and Piers Morgan for their comments about a nude snapshot she shared.

Kardashians harsh jabs had her followers wondering if her notoriously hot-headed husband Kanye West was speaking out on her behalf, but the reality star insists the venomous tweets were all from her.

Wait I can't believe people thought Kanye or Khloe hacked my Twitter. I swear I'm funny too!!!  Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) March 8, 2016

The revelation begs the question: Is Wests erratic and bizarre behavior is rubbing off on Kardashian?

Lindsey Carnett, PR expert, expects Kim and Kanyes behavior and Twitter rants are something that the public has to get used to.

Weve heard the term misery loves company, she said. People who complain or rant are made for each other. Think of observing couples who have been married for years go on outings wearing the same color sweater with khaki pants. Be prepared to see Kimye evolve as they grow closer. These impulsive Twitter behaviors are just the beginning of whats yet to come. They are a sociologists dream couple.

And Kardashians new need to speak out didnt end with her tweets.

The star also took to her blog to defend her selfies and even her sex tape from 2003.

I don't do drugs, I hardly drink, I've never committed a crimeand yet I'm a bad role model for being proud of my body? she wrote. I lived through the embarrassment and fear, and decided to say who cares, do better, move on. I shouldn't have to constantly be on the defense, listing off my accomplishments just to prove that I am more than something that happened 13 years ago. Let's move on, already. I have.

Ultimately, pop culture expert Cate Meighan doesnt believe Kims Kanye-inspired behavior will help her in the long run.

She wasn't exactly the favorite Kardashian sister before and being vicious isn't going to make her so either, she explained. While slut-shaming has become a huge issue, I just don't feel like it's the bottom line in this instance. I lean instead towards the idea that maybe after numerous naked selfies and magazine photo shoots it has just gotten a bit stale. Kim's wardrobe, hair and empire has evolved and so maybe people would like to see what she can do besides dropping her clothes in front of a bathroom mirror.

The 35-year-old ended her blog post with a message similar to what Kardashian fans are used to hearing the family preach.

It's 2016. The body-shaming and slut-shamingit's like, enough is enough. I will not live my life dictated by the issues you have with my sexuality. You be you and let me be me.",[]

TEHRAN, Iran  Iran reportedly test-fired two ballistic missiles Wednesday with the phrase ""Israel must be wiped out"" written in Hebrew on them, a show of force by the Islamic Republic as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden visited Israel.

Such phrases have been emblazoned on missiles fired before by Iran, but this test comes as the country recently signed a nuclear deal with world powers, including America, and conducted another test the day before.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Chairman McCaul: The terrorist exodus has begun and we're not ready for it,['Michael Mccaul'],"FBI Director James Comey testified before Congress in 2014 that the thousands of Western foreign fighters bound for the Middle East would one day come home as battle-hardened extremists.

There will be a terrorist diaspora out of those areasespecially Syriathat we all wake up every day thinking and worrying about, he warned.

Two years later, the exodus has begun in earnest, and we are woefully unprepared to deal with it.

More than 6,000 Westerners, including Americans, have gone to fight with groups like ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and reportedly around 2,000 of them have returnedsome to plot terrorist attacks and others to set up new extremist networks.

The reality could not be more clear: jihadists are coming home, and they are piggy-backing on the refugee flows to avoid detection.

We saw this in November with the Paris attacks, in January with a suicide bombing in Turkey against Western tourists, and in February when German authorities arrested two terror suspects for allegedly plotting an attack in Berlin.

In each of these cases, terrorists reportedly posed as Syrian refugees fleeing the war-torn country.

One international terrorism think tank has catalogued at least 40 suspected jihadists who have been caught entering Europe posing as migrants or refugees.

Indeed, the attempts are becoming so common that a top American NATO commander testified before Congress last week that terrorists and returning foreign fighters are becoming a daily part of the refugee flow into Europe. If that doesnt set off alarm bells, then I dont know what does.

This year it will only get easier for extremists to blend into the mix. The number of refugees and migrants arriving in Europe in just the past two monthsmore than 100,000has already exceeded the entire first half of last year, according to UN figures.

But we cannot pretend the problem is an ocean away. For us, the danger is a plane-flight away, as extremists are trying to infiltrate U.S. humanitarian programs, too.

Intelligence officials have notified me that possible terror suspects in Syria have already tried to enter our country as refugees.

The concerted effort by ISIS to deploy operativesusing whatever routes possibleshould come as no surprise. The group is dead set on ramping up external operations and has already been linked to 75 terrorist plots against the West, one-third targeting the United States.

ISIS members in their own words have threatened to take advantage of the Syrian refugee crisis to launch attacks, and they are clearly following through on it.

My committee will release a report next month on the issue of terrorist exploitation of refugee flows, marking the conclusion of a year-long review into the threat. The findings are concerning.

For instance, gaping security loopholes are making it easier for violent extremists to slip through the cracksand possibly get closer to our homeland. Nowhere is this clearer than in Europe, where the continents open borders have become a cause celebre for jihadists.

There are no real controls, one diplomat in the region explained to us, adding that authorities take fingerprints, accept whatever identification they provideif they have oneand send them on their way. My Committee found many countries were not checking this information against counterterrorism databases.

This is inexcusable. If foreign governments are not rigorously screening refugees against terrorist watchlists, they will likely be overlooked, putting our allies at risk and allowing extremists to get one step closer to the United States.

We cannot adopt a wait-and-see approach while jihadists ride the wave of refugees into the West. We must act.

That is why this month the House Homeland Security Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee will work to move bills through Congress to accelerate security cooperation with our overseas partnersespecially on disrupting terrorist travel. The legislation would help our allies put better counterterrorism checks in place and focus U.S. assistance on the highest-risk countries.

We also need to strengthen our defenses here at home.

In November, the House voted on a bill I co-authored with Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., the American SAFE Act, to enhance screening of Syrian and Iraqi refugees to weed out terror suspects. The legislation, which passed with a bipartisan veto-proof majority, does not shut the door on refugees; instead, it adds additional layers of security to the process for the highest-risk refugee categories.

Yet the president has pressured Democrats to stall this bill in the Senate. At a time when our enemies are targeting refugee routes to sneak into our country, I am worried that delay could be deadly.

Already this year two ISIS-linked Iraqi refugees were arrested in the United States on terror charges, one of which had reportedly returned from fighting in Syria.

Ultimately, the real security gap we must close is the leadership vacuum on the international stage. Hesitancy and half-measures have allowed Syria to become a jihadist powder keg, and lack of American leadership has encouraged Russia and Iran to fan the flames.

This is a humanitarian catastrophe, to be sure. But if we dont get more assertive in resolving the crisis, it will be remembered for becoming a terrorist Trojan Horse.

foxnews.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,Why is Greenland's ice getting darker?,['Michael Casey'],"Greenland cant seem to catch a break.

Not only are its ice sheets melting due to skyrocketing temperatures but now researchers using satellite data have found that it has gotten darker over the past two decades. That means its absorbing more of the heat, which in turn, is further increasing snow melt.

That trend is likely to continue, with the surfaces reflectivity, or albedo, decreasing by as much as 10 percent by the end of the century, according to a study on the data in the European Geophysical Union journal The Cryosphere.

Related: Glacier twice as big as Manhattan snaps off Greenland ice sheet

Researchers said soot from wildfires in China, Siberia and North America contributed to the darker surface but it was mostly the feedback loops created by the melting that was driving the changes in Greenland.

The feedback loops are especially prevalent during the summer, when clear skies and lots of sunshine result in surface melting. As the top layers of fresh snow disappear, dust from erosion or soot that blew in years before, begin to appear, darkening the surface.

Related Image Expand / Contract Aerial images of Greenland show rivers of meltwater and areas of dark ice. . (Marco Tedesco/Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory)

At the same time, as the snow melts and refreezes, the grains of snow get larger. The larger grains create a less reflective surface that allows more solar radiation to be absorbed.

You dont necessarily have to have a dirtier snowpack to make it dark, said lead author Marco Tedesco, a research professor at Columbia Universitys Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and adjunct scientist at NASA Goddard Institute of Space Studies.

A snowpack that might look clean to our eyes can be more effective in absorbing solar radiation than a dirty one, he said in a statement. Overall, what matters, it is the total amount of solar energy that the surface absorbs. This is the real driver of melting.

The results have global implications, since the melting ice sheets of Greenland contributed to rising sea levels that may put many of the world's coastal cities at risk and have the potential to cause other disruptions in ocean circulation  specifically disruptions in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation.

Related: Greenland's snow hides 100 billion tons of water

Its a complex system of interaction between the atmosphere and the ice sheet surface. Rising temperatures are promoting more melting, and that melting is reducing albedo, which in turn is increasing melting,"" Tedesco said. How this accumulates over decades is going to be important, because it can accelerate the amount of water Greenland loses. Even if we dont have a lot of melting because of atmospheric conditions one year, the surface is more sensitive to any kind of input the sun can give it, because of the previous cycle.

The study used satellite data to compare summertime changes in Greenlands albedo from 1981 to 2012. The first decade showed little change, but starting around 1996, the data show that due to darkening, the ice began absorbing about 2 percent more solar radiation per decade. At the same time, summer near-surface temperatures in Greenland increased at a rate of about 1.33 degrees per decade, allowing more snow to melt and fuel the feedback loops.

Related: Icy Greenland melting at accelerating rate, study finds

So how can we put the brakes on this darkening?

The feedback loops could be halted with the addition of more snow and less melting. But Tedesco said that doesnt seem likely given the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Worse, the increased warming is expected to bring more precipitation to the region  which would further enhance the melting of the ice sheets.

As warming continues, the feedback from declining albedo will add up, Tedesco said. Its a train running downhill, and the hill is getting steeper.",[]

You can catch a cold from standing close to someone who's sick or turning a doorknob that they touched.

That's similar to how airborne viruses infect computer systems with malware. These viruses spread over Wi-Fi connections, from one computer to another.

That's what's happening with a virus that can be transmitted through billions of wireless keyboards and computer mice. That's according to cybersecurity firm Bastille, which reports that wireless devices that do not use a Bluetooth connection are at risk of spreading the MouseJack virus.

All a hacker needs to get into your computer is a $15 dongle and few lines of computer code. The hacker intercepts your computer dongle's radio frequency.

Here's how it works. When you're using a wireless keyboard or mouse, you have a dongle that listens for its radio frequency. When you type in something or move your mouse, the dongle picks up that message and makes the appropriate action.

Hackers are intercepting radio frequencies using the 2.4GHz ISM band. Unlike Bluetooth, there isn't an industry standard to protect your devices. So, manufacturers create their own security system, if they have one.

This vulnerability affects Windows PCs, Macs and Linux computers. It also affects several types of wireless keyboards and computer mice, including Dell, Lenovo and Logitech. (See link to complete list below.)

Once the hacker is in, they gain full access to your computer, although they need to be within about 100 meters of you. They can take over your computer and infect it with malware.

Thats the frosty message University of Oregon researchers are getting over a widely-ridiculed study on gender and glaciers that cost taxpayers a big chunk of cash.

Researchers at the school published a scientific study examining the relationship between gender and glaciers as part of a federally-funded government grant from the National Science Foundation.

The paper, titled Glaciers, gender, and science"" and authored by University of Oregon professor Mark Carey, found that ice is not just ice and called on scientists to take a feminist political ecology and feminist postcolonial approach when researching glaciers and climate change.

The study, which centers around ""feminist glaciology,"" was published in January and was part of a nearly half million dollar federal grant, according to The Free Beacon and College Fix -- though it's unclear how much of the $412,930 in funds went specifically toward Carey's paper.

Glaciers are key icons of climate change and global environmental change, Carey wrote. However, the relationships among gender, science, and glaciers -- particularly related to epistemological questions about the production of glaciological knowledge -- remain understudied.""

""Merging feminist postcolonial science studies and feminist political ecology, the feminist glaciology framework generates robust analysis of gender, power and epistemologies in dynamic social-ecological systems, thereby leading to more just and equitable science and human-ice interactions, the paper reads.

Writing on Powerlineblog.com, Steven Hayward called the study

""academic gibberish,"" and said he initially thought the paper was

parody.

Im sure Carey is well-intentioned, but if his goal was to put a human face on climate change, he failed, Robby Soave wrote in Reason magazine. The paper is simply impossible to read with a straight face. It employs liberal buzzwords -- colonialism, marginalization, masculinist discourses, etc. -- with such frequency that the entire thing comes off like a joke.

The University of Oregon said in a Feb. 26 press release that Carey hired undergraduate student Jaclyn Rushing to ""explore how nongovernmental organizations were addressing melting Himalayan glaciers.""

""Her dive into the literature found that women's voices are rarely heard in glacier-related research, a finding that triggered a larger project and led to a paper now online ahead of print by the journal Progress in Human Geography,"" the statement said.

The press release went on to quote Carey as saying, ""Jaclyn found a report that noted how women are more vulnerable to glacier changes and hazards than are men.""

""I had never researched these gendered vulnerabilities,"" said Carey, an associate dean of the Clark Honors College and a professor of history and environmental studies.

Carey did not respond to a request for comment when contacted Tuesday.

The National Science Foundation funded the study as part of a project that initially set out to examine the early development and subsequent evolution of the five main aspects of glaciology,"" according to The Free Beacon.

The paper poses the question, Why feminist glaciology? and then answers it by arguing that scientific research of glaciers has been dominated by men and masculinity.

""Most existing glaciological research -- and hence discourse and discussions about cryospheric change -- stems from information produced by men, about men, with manly characteristics, and within masculinist discourses, the paper says.",[]

Martin's death was confirmed on Twitter by Beatles drummer Ringo Starr. His management said in an e-mail to the Associated Press that Martin had ""passed away peacefully at home"".

God bless George Martin peace and love to Judy and his family love Ringo and Barbara George will be missed xxx   #RingoStarr (@ringostarrmusic) March 9, 2016

Martin had been dubbed ""The Fifth Beatle"" for his work with the legendary rock band. He signed the Beatles to EMI's Parlophone record label in 1962 and went on to produce some of the most popular and influential albums of modern times -- ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" ""Revolver,"" ""Rubber Soul,"" ""Abbey Road"". Along the way, Martin and the Beatles elevated rock LPs from ways to cash in on hit singles to art forms, ""concepts.""

Martin later recalled meeting the quartet for the first time and realizing their potential, saying ""I liked them as people apart from anything else, and I was convinced that we had the makings of a hit group.""

However, he was not convinced they had songwriting ability.

""As composers, they didn't rate. They hadn't shown me that they could write anything at all,"" he once told the magazine Melody Maker. ""'Love Me Do' I thought was pretty poor, but it was the best we could do.""

Martin both witnessed and enabled the extraordinary changes of the Beatles and of the 1960s. From a raw first album that took just a day to make, to the months-long production of ""Sgt. Pepper,"" the Beatles advanced by quantum steps as songwriters and sonic explorers, turning the studio into a wonderland of tape loops, multi-tracking, unpredictable tempos, unfathomable segues and kaleidoscopic montages.

""Once we got beyond the bubblegum stage, the early recordings, and they wanted to do something more adventurous, they were saying, `What can you give us?""' Martin told The Associated Press in 2002. ""And I said, `I can give you anything you like.""'

Martin was endlessly called on to perform the impossible, and often succeeded, splicing recordings at different speeds for ""Strawberry Fields Forever"" or, for ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite,"" simulating a calliope with keyboards, harmonica and a harmonium that the producer himself played with such intensity he passed out on the floor. Martin would have several good turns on the keyboards, performing a lively music hall solo on McCartney's ""Lovely Rita"" and a speeded-up Baroque reverie on Lennon's ""In My Life.""

After the group broke up, he started his own music publishing company, George Martin Music, and worked with a number of artists, including Jeff Beck, Bob Dylan, Sting and Sir Elton John. He also produced two of Paul McCartney's solo albums, ""Tug Of War"" and ""Pipes Of Peace"". He won six Grammys and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1996. Three years later, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

He co-produced ""Candle In The Wind,"" which was released to mark the death of Princess Diana in 1997. The song, which Elton John performed at Diana's funeral, sold 37 million copies, and was the last chart-topping hit Martin ever produced.

It wasn't immediately clear why the plainclothes narcotics detective chose to stop a white Cadillac, Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Chief Tom Hackney said. The man who shot the officer had just threatened his girlfriend with a gun and was reported as being suicidal.

""It was bad luck that the officer encounters him immediately after this,"" Hackney said.

The detective, who is not being identified because he works undercover, was wearing a ""body armor"" style vest when he got out of his car to approach the suspect, Hackney said. The word ""police"" was marked clearly on the vest.

The driver immediately opened fire, Hackney said, hitting the detective in the head, upper body and hand. The detective was out of surgery Wednesday afternoon and in critical but ""more stable condition.""

The suspect, who has not yet been identified, ran away from the shooting scene and stole a large flatbed truck from a nearby business, Hackney said.

The detective, whose 14-year-old son was in the car but unharmed, managed to call for help.

The officers located the truck and pursued it into a nearby neighborhood, where it crashed into a house. The man ran into the backyard and two officers found the suspect holding a gun. They ordered him to drop it, Hackney said, and when he didn't, the suspect was shot four times. He survived and is in custody.

The officers who fired are on administrative leave.

It was unclear why the detective had his vest on while off duty. Hackney said narcotics detectives often carry their bullet-proof vests in the car with them because they can be called into work at any time.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,At least 9 firefighters injured after natural gas explosion in Seattle neighborhood,[],"A natural gas explosion rocked a Seattle neighborhood early Wednesday, destroying several businesses and sending nine firefighters to a hospital.

Crews were responding to reports of a natural gas leak when the explosion occurred along a main thoroughfare north of downtown, Seattle Fire Department spokeswoman Corey Orvold said.

The cause was under investigation. There were no reports of any other injuries or anyone missing. Dogs were being used to go through the rubble just in case.

Video surveillance from the Olive and Grape Mediterranean Restaurant showed a bright flash at 1:43 a.m. and then the room shakes as debris falls from the ceiling. A large garage door covering the restaurant's front windows protected it from extensive damage.

""The Olive and Grape was lucky,"" owner Paola Kossack told The Associated Press in an email.

Bike shop owner Davey Oil said he arrived soon after the fire trucks.

""There were tons of flames leaping over what was already the rubble of Neptune coffee, which as you can see now totaled, gone,"" he said.

Crews were still dousing an active flame with foam as the Greenwood neighborhood awakened.

Residents were checking out the damage along with the rubble and glass that littered the streets. Workers from one cafe damaged in the blast poured coffee for firefighters.

Among the businesses damaged or destroyed were Neptune Coffee, Mr. Gyro and the bike shop G&O Family Cyclery. An apartment building and another nearby residential structure were evacuated.

""Our block is a pretty close-knit block and this is pretty terrible,"" Oil said.

Chocolati Cafe manager Darla Weidman said she was relieved the blast occurred overnight instead of 11 a.m. when the shop sometimes is packed with people.

""I know neighbors will do everything they can to support these businesses as they begin the long and challenging task to recover and repair from this incident,"" Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said in a statement. ""The city will also be there to do what we can.""

Puget Sound Energy spokeswoman Akiko Oda said gas service for the impacted buildings was shut off about an hour after the blast and the shutdown was later expanded.

The utility said it completed leak surveys for the block around the area and no leaks were found.

Oda says it will take time to determine what caused the explosion and the utility will be working with the Seattle Fire Department in the investigation.

Pipeline safety investigators from the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission were also on site.

Harborview Medical Center spokeswoman Susan Gregg said eight firefighters and a battalion chief were treated at the facility. None of the eight men and one woman was admitted to the hospital.

""We didn't have anybody with burns, nothing life-threatening, nothing major"" said Gregg, adding that some firefighters were checked out because the blast was so powerful that it pushed them back.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,3 days of mourning for former first lady Nancy Reagan begin,[],"Three days of formal mourning for former first lady Nancy Reagan were set to begin Wednesday.

Daughter Patti Davis, dressed in black, greeted friends upon arrival at a Santa Monica mortuary where a brief service was scheduled before a motorcade was to take the casket about 45 miles to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley for the first of two days of public viewing.

Several dozen spectators gathered outside, including a few from the hospital across the street.

""She was just a very classy woman, always,"" said Jeanie Maurello, a medical assistant at Providence St. John's Health Center. ""I thought she did a wonderful job. `Just Say No' to drugs, she was behind all that.""

Another medical assistant, Lupe Salazar, said she was also an admirer. ""She did a lot of work that helped the country,"" Salazar said.

Maurello added: ""There's always a great woman behind every great man.""

Eight Secret Service agents who served the Reagans were to serve as pallbearers to transfer the casket from the funeral home to a hearse for the drive to the library in the hills northwest of Los Angeles.

Friday will be the funeral -- which was planned down to the smallest details by the former first lady herself. Just as she was always by his side in life, Nancy Reagan will be laid to rest just inches from her husband on a hillside tomb facing west toward the Pacific Ocean.

Before her death she planned the funeral's flower arrangements, the music to be played by a Marine Corps band and the people who received invitations to the private memorial.

Among those who had RSVP'd for the service were former President George W. Bush and his wife, former first lady Laura Bush; former first lady Rosalynn Carter; first lady Michelle Obama; and former first lady Hillary Clinton.

""No doubt about it, the most important of her special requests was that she be laid to rest right next to the president, as close as possible,"" said John Heubusch, executive director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library.

""The way the tomb is constructed,"" he continued, ""her casket will literally be set forth in the ground inches from President Reagan's.""

The hourlong service, to which approximately 1,000 people have been invited, was to take place on the library's lawn. On a clear day the gravesite affords visitors ocean views.

Those with White House connections who have said they will attend include President Richard Nixon's daughter Tricia Nixon Cox and President Lyndon Johnson's daughters Lynda Bird Johnson Robb and Luci Baines Johnson. Other guests will include Katie Couric, Chris Matthews, Newt and Callista Gingrich, Anjelica Houston, Wayne Newton and Mr. T, the Ronald Reagan Foundation said Wednesday. Mr. T was involved in Mrs. Reagan's ""Just Say No"" anti-drug efforts during the 1980s.

Capt. Christopher Bolt, commanding officer of the USS Ronald Reagan, will also be in attendance.

""One of our saddest situations is we have so many people who have called or written, saying they would like to attend, but unfortunately it needs to be by invitation only because we only have so much room on the lawn,"" Heubusch said. ""As a result, Mrs. Reagan was very adamant about having some time where the public could come by and pay last respects.""

Public viewings are scheduled at the library from 1 to 7 p.m. on Wednesday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Thursday.

First ladies' funerals, once a quiet affair, changed significantly following the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's widow, Eleanor Roosevelt, in 1962.

Mrs. Roosevelt, a United Nations delegate, author and prominent political figure in her own right, tried to keep the event fairly quiet, limiting the guest list to 250 people, although those guests included President John F. Kennedy, former Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, and future President Lyndon Johnson. More than 1,000 mourners jammed the streets outside the church in Hyde Park, New York.

The most recent first lady's funeral was for President Gerald Ford's widow, Betty, in 2011. Some 800 people, including Mrs. Reagan, attended a private memorial service for her in Palm Springs, California, followed by a second, smaller service in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan.

When former President Richard Nixon's wife, Pat, died in 1993 some 4,000 people attended a public viewing for her at the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, California. A private service took place the next day, and Mrs. Reagan and her husband were among those who attended.",[]

VanZant joins another all-star cast of celebrities and sports stars on the show this season including Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown, ""Fuller House"" star Jodie Sweetin and Super Bowl champion Von Miller.

The 21-year-old joins Hall of Famers Chuck Liddell and Randy Couture as UFC fighters who have appeared on the show, but she is the first ever to join the series as an active competitor.

VanZant last foght in December, when she lost by rear naked choke to Rose Namajunas at UFC Fight Night in Las Vegas.

Prior to that loss, VanZant had won her first three fights in the UFC as she climbed into the top 10 rankings at 115 pounds.

""Dancing with the Stars"" will kick off in March with the show running all the way through May for the celebrities who make it all the way through the elimination-style competition.

Before she was a fighter, VanZant was actively involved in dance and cheerleading so this seems like a natural fit for the Team Alpha Male fighter.

VanZant is expected to compete on the show while still training for her return to the Octagon later this year. While nothing has been booked, VanZant has targeted UFC 200 for her next fight but she'll look to knock out a ""Dancing with the Stars"" championship first.",[]

But thanks to last autumns above-average rainfall, Californias Death Valley National Park is experiencing a super bloom of wildflowersa rare occurrence that happens just once every 10 years.

Death Valley holds the world record for hottest temperature ever recordeda whopping 134 degrees Fahrenheit on July 10, 1913. Temperatures peak in the summer, and cool off slightly in the winter, which also coincides with the rainy season. The Valleys annual rainfall is just two inchessometimes it gets no rain at all.

Related Image Expand / Contract More than 20 species of wildflower bloom in the park at various elevations throughout Death Valley. (AP)

But this year, the park got over three inches of rain during the first two weeks in October. The above-average rainfall was enough to trigger the growth of millions of wildflower seeds that have been dormant for years. The last time there was a bloom of this magnitude was in 2005, and the time before that was in 1998.

What kind of flowers can you seen in the desert?

The most abundant and eye-catching wildflower is the aptly named desert gold, a large, bright yellow bloom that looks like a daisy. The stems this year are growing to waist height, and the flowers cover entire hillsides and vast areas of the valley floor in the southern section of the park. These flowers are easily enjoyed from the car.

Some of the other more common flowers include the deep purple phacelia; the desert five-spot, a delicate pink flower with five burgundy spots around its center; the gravel ghost, a delicate white flower that appears to be floating aboveground like a ghost because its stem is so thin it's almost invisible; and various types of desert primrose.

How long will I be able to see the wildflowers bloom?

The show won't last forever. Most of the flowers will wither in the next few weeks as temperatures start to rise.

Some flowers may be around as late as June at higher elevations, but those won't be as easy to see from a car and could require hiking.

What part of the park has the best blooms?

Now, the best flower show is at the south end of Death Valley National Park along Badwater Road, south of Furnace Creek. As the temperature rises, those flowers will fade, and the bloom will move north and to higher elevations.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Hey, Republicans, stop hating on Trump voters",['Steve Moore'],"Will Republicans please stop insulting Trump voters? Just stop. I know that many hate Trump, but his voters too?

Mitt Romney derides Trump voters as suckers. Others have sneered that Trump has an army of low information voters who have been duped, and that these people shouldnt be able to decide on the fate of a Grand Old Party. Trumps voters, the political class screams, have hijacked the Republican Party.

Another conservative commentator complained the other day that many of these voters have never even voted before and they are not even Republicans. Huh?

Isnt it a good thing that Trump is steering millions of new voters away from the Democrats and attracting them to the GOP? I thought we were told Republicans lost in 2012 because so many conservatives stayed home. Here they are.

The GOPs mighty establishment wing  the people who get rich off the game of politics -- pretend that theirs is the party of the working class, of blue collar virtue, and hard work, but now that the workers they supposedly represent are in revolt, apparently the problem is the voters not the party. This is insanity.

This is like the executives at Coca Cola blaming the stupid public for not liking New Coke. What kind of a company blames its customers when things go wrong? Inside Washington, there are no term limits on stupidity.

Former House Republican majority leader Tom DeLay advised on Fox this past Friday that Republicans should do all they can to stop Trump from getting a majority (though he will likely have a plurality) and then at the convention, throw Trump and his troublemaking voters under the bus and pick someone who got millions of fewer votes than Trump did. Delays point is that the party and its delegates, not the voters, should choose who the nominee is. He seemed to be saying: its our club and we make the rules. (Funny, Republicans just a few weeks ago were guffawing that Democrats had rigged their primary process.)

The rules of the party apparently say that Delay is right. So the master plan is to let the elites decide whats best for us.

Gee. I thought thats what liberals do!

Im no Trump enthusiast by any means  and I agree with some of what he says and believe that he is flat out wrong about the benefits of trade and immigration  which are substantial. Trump is often offensive and unpredictable.

But the Trump haters ought to get out and attend a Trump rally.

You will meet truck drivers, and soccer moms, and veterans, and taxicab drivers, and immigrants, and construction workers, and young people, and not a lot of Wall Streeters or political consultants. They are patriotic. They are seething in anger at both parties.

We've had eight years of a mostly failed Republican president followed by eight years of a failed Democrat in the White House.

Over this whole period many of these voters haven't seen a pay increase and many have seen their incomes fall -- while GOP political consultants rake in millions for losing.

The fact that four of the wealthiest counties in America are inside or near the Washington Beltway says everything voters need to know about how they are being bled dry by government.

Whenever I say anything nice about Trump I get scowls and lectures from my conservative friends in Washington that Trump voters dont believe in the principles of the Republican Party.

Wait. The Republicans in Congress just passed a budget that spends tens of billions more than when Democrats ran Congress. The GOP budget increases the deficit. I thought that key principles of the GOP were less government, balanced budgets and fiscal responsibility.

The Republicans have only themselves to blame for this working class revolt. These are voters who are horrified by what Obama has done to our country and they put their faith in Republicans to fix things  and they didnt. Worse, they havent even try.



And now the Republican brain trust is hatching a plan to effectively disenfranchise the Trump voters altogether. I hope Im wrong, but when the GOP loses again with this strategy, and Hillary Clinton is being sworn into office, the party leaders will scratch their heads and ask: Gee, where did all those Trump voters go?

foxnews.com,2016-02-26 00:00:00,Food for thought: Human teeth likely shrank due to tool use,[],"Wisdom teeth may have shrunk during human evolution as part of changes that started with human tool use, according to a new study.

The research behind this finding could lead to a new way of figuring out how closely related fossil species are to modern humans, scientists added.

Although modern humans are the only surviving members of the human family tree, other species once lived on Earth. However, deducing the relationships between modern humans and these extinct hominins  humans and related species dating back to the split from the chimpanzee lineage  is difficult because fossils of ancient hominins are rare. [Image Gallery: Our Closest Human Ancestor]

Teeth are the hominin fossils most often found because they are the hardest parts of the human body. ""Teeth are central to how a fossil ancestor lived, and can tell us about which species they belonged to, how they are related to other species, what they ate, and how quickly or slowly they developed during childhood,"" said lead study author Alistair Evans, an evolutionary biologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.

Hominin teeth have shrunk in size throughout evolution, a trend perhaps most clearly seen with the wisdom teeth located at the back of the mouth, the researchers said. In modern humans, wisdom teeth are often very small or do not even develop, while in many other hominin species they were huge, with chewing surfaces two to four times larger than those of their modern human counterparts.

Previous research suggested this profound shrinking in modern human wisdom tooth size was due to the advent of cooking or other changes in diet unique to modern humans. However, Evans and his colleagues now suggest this shift may have begun much earlier in human evolution.

The scientists analyzed tooth size in modern humans and fossil hominins. They found that hominin teeth fell into two major groups. One group was composed of the genus Homo, which includes both modern humans and extinct human relatives. The other group was made up of early hominins preceding Homo, such as the australopiths, the first primates to walk on two feet.

In australopiths and other early hominins, the scientists found that teeth tended to get bigger toward the back of the mouth, with proportions that stayed constant regardless of the overall size of the teeth. However, in the genus Homo, the smaller all the teeth were, the smaller the teeth were toward the back of the mouth.

""There seems to be a key difference between the two groups of hominins  perhaps one of the things that defines our genus Homo,"" Evans said in a statement.

This change in how teeth developed between genus Homo and earlier hominins may have occurred due to the advent of advanced tool use in the genus Homo, Evans said.

""It's always been presumed that sometime in early Homo, we started using more advanced tools,"" Evans told Live Science. ""Tool use meant we didn't need as big teeth and jaws as earlier hominins. This may then have increased evolutionary pressure to spend less energy developing teeth, making our teeth smaller.""

In modern humans, tooth-size reduction has reached the point where wisdom teeth are increasingly failing to develop, Evans said. ""The advent of cooking made food easier to eat, meaning we didn't need big teeth as much,"" Evans said.

Prior work suggested there was a lot of variation in how teeth evolved in hominins. ""Now we're seeing some very simple, clear patterns in hominin tooth evolution instead,"" Evans said. [Infographic: Human Origins  How Hominids Evolved]

These patterns could help researchers decide whether ancient hominins were members of genus Homo or not, Evans said.

""It's been suggested a number of times over the past 20 years that maybe Homo habilis, often considered the earliest member of Homo, should be considered an australopith instead,"" Evans said. ""We found Homo habilis tooth proportions followed the australopith rule and not the Homo rule, which supports the argument that Homo habilis should be reclassified to something like Australopithecus habilis.""

This new work builds on previous experiments with mice that suggested teeth could influence each other during development. In this ""inhibitory cascade model,"" teeth that develop early can inhibit the size of teeth that develop later. These new findings suggest this mechanism underlying tooth size in mice and most mammals is seen in hominins as well, Evans said.

These findings suggest that by knowing the size of a single hominin tooth and the group to which it belongs, scientists could infer the size of the hominin's remaining teeth with considerable accuracy. ""Sometimes we find only a few teeth in a fossil,"" Evans said. ""With our new insight, we can reliably estimate how big the missing teeth were.""

Future research could analyze controversial hominin discoveries such as Homo naledi, recently unearthed in South Africa, Evans said. ""It's got an interesting mix of traits, some that look like Homo, some that look australopith,"" Evans said. ""It'd be interesting to examine its teeth and see which pattern it fits best.""

The scientists detailed their findings in the Feb. 25 issue of the journal Nature.

But then comes the reality check, aka the ""home inspection."" Such simple words, yet so fraught with stress and fear! Many contracts include a contingency that allows the buyer to back out if serious problems are found during inspection. So, bring on the fear.

Of course, you know your home and you think it's just fine, but maybe a professional with a less sentimental eye might see it differently?

To keep at least one step ahead, check out these common issues found during an inspection. That way you can fix them, save the deal, and even save yourself!

Dank basement

It's more than just a horror film clich. Frank Lesh, executive director of the American Society of Home Inspectors, says the most common problem he finds is basement seepage, which could lead to full-fledged flooding. Groundwater infiltrates your home through small cracks or over a foundation wall. A basement waterproofing contractor can give you a bid on quickly repairing any minor problems before they become (to quote a certain presidential candidate) ""yuge.""

Shoddy wiring

The next most common issue is electrical, which can be anything from a receptacle that doesn't function to wiring that is overfused and dangerous. Inspector Reggie Marston routinely discovers ""ungrounded fixtures, spliced wires not terminated in a proper electric box, receptacles wired backward, and improper breakers in the electric service panel."" Any electrical issue requires immediate attention, since it could lead to a fire.

Amateur workmanship

Next up are potential headaches that are a direct result of when a homeowner ""decides that they can do major work around the house without paying a contractor,"" says Marston. ""With plumbing, the owners will install the toilet but don't tighten it securely to the floor. I'll find a toilet's so loose that I counsel my client it should have a seat belt installed so nobody falls off!"" If you've done home improvement work yourself, consider having a professional double-check the project.

Leaky roof

Roof leaks left unattended can become major problems, says Lesh, ""especially when mold starts to form. Small leaks can easily be overlooked because they're not noticeable until something serious happens. That's why it's a good idea to have an ASHI-certified inspector come out and check your house periodically."" Lesh points out that homes don't have a ""check engine light. You need someone who does not have a vested interest in finding problems to inspect it.""

Poor maintenance

Marston says many homes suffer from an overall lack of upkeep. He recently inspected a house where ""the dryer vent hadn't been cleaned in years. There was such a lint buildup inside the vent pipe that it had actually caused the exterior wall where the vent exited to bulge out.""

Marston reminds owners that ""all components in a residence require some type of maintenance. Water heaters as well as heating and air-conditioning systems should be serviced yearly. Caulk tubs and showers to prevent water leakage. Frequently remove and clean stove exhaust fan filters.""

Also maintain kitchen appliances. Marston once turned on a garbage disposal ""and something started clanking. Someone had dropped their class ring in and it had been there for a while. That ring was never to be worn again!""

Bonus: Don't forget about re-inspections

Marston often does re-inspections of properties after issues have supposedly been fixed. Yet 95% of the time, he estimates, ""the requested repairs haven't been done or they've been done wrong.""

On a recent re-inspection, Marston should have found a repaired dryer vent, fixed sewer pipe, working sump pump, and a regrade away from the foundation. Instead, Marston discovered the entire dryer vent now needed replacing, the new sewer pipe connection still leaked, a new sump pump wouldn't turn on, and the regrading was ""a couple shovels full of dirt. Obviously now my client is upset, doesn't trust the seller and, I believe, was thinking of backing out of the contract.""",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-03 00:00:00,"Why did ancient Europeans just disappear 14,500 Years Ago?",[],"Some of Europe's earliest inhabitants mysteriously vanished toward the end of the last ice age and were largely replaced by others, a new genetic analysis finds.

The finds come from an analysis of dozens of ancient fossil remains collected across Europe.

The genetic turnover was likely the result of a rapidly changing climate, which the earlier inhabitants of Europe couldn't adapt to quickly enough, said the study's co-author, Cosimo Posth, an archaeogenetics doctoral candidate at the University of Tubingen in Germany.

The temperature change around that time was ""enormous compared to the climactic changes that are happening in our century,"" Posth told Live Science. ""You have to imagine that also the environment changed pretty drastically.""

A twisted family tree

Europe has a long and tangled genetic legacy. Genetic studies have revealed that the first modern humans who poured out of Africa, somewhere between 40,000 and 70,000 years ago, soon got busy mating with local Neanderthals. At the beginning of the agricultural revolution, between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago, farmers from the Middle East swept across Europe, gradually replacing the native hunter-gatherers. Around 5,000 years ago, nomadic horsemen called the Yamnaya emerged from the steppes of Ukraine and intermingled with the native population. In addition, another lost group of ancient Europeans mysteriously vanished about 4,500 years ago, a 2013 study in the journal Nature Communications found.

But relatively little was known about human occupation of Europe between the first out-of-Africa event and the end of the last ice age, around 11,000 years ago. During some of that time, the vast Weichselian Ice Sheet covered much of northern Europe, while glaciers in the Pyrenees and the Alps blocked east-west passage across the continent.

Lost lineages

To get a better picture of Europe's genetic legacy during this cold snap, Posth and his colleagues analyzed mitochondrial DNA  genetic material passed on from mother to daughter  from the remains of 55 different human fossils between 35,000 and 7,000 years old, coming from across the continent, from Spain to Russia. Based on mutations, or changes in this mitochondrial DNA, geneticists have identified large genetic populations, or super-haplogroups, that share distant common ancestors.

""Basically all modern humans outside of Africa, from Europe to the tip of South America, they belong to these two super-haplogroups that are M or N,"" Posth said. Nowadays, everyone of European descent has the N mitochondrial haplotype, while the M subtype is common throughout Asia and Australasia.

The team found that in ancient people, the M haplogroup predominated until about 14,500 years ago, when it mysteriously and suddenly vanished. The M haplotype carried by the ancient Europeans, which no longer exists in Europe today, shared a common ancestor with modern-day M-haplotype carriers around 50,000 years ago.

The genetic analysis also revealed that Europeans, Asians and Australasians may descend from a group of humans who emerged from Africa and rapidly dispersed throughout the continent no earlier than 55,000 years ago, the researchers reported Feb. 4 in the journal Current Biology.

Time of upheaval

The team suspects this upheaval may have been caused by wild climate swings.

At the peak of the ice age, around 19,000 to 22,000 years ago, people hunkered down in climactic ""refugia,"" or ice-free regions of Europe, such as modern-day Spain, the Balkans and southern Italy, Posth said. While holdouts survived in a few places farther north, their populations shrank dramatically.

Then around 14,500 years ago, the temperature spiked significantly, the tundra gave way to forest and many iconic beasts, such as woolly mammoths and saber-toothed tigers, disappeared from Eurasia, he said.

For whatever reason, the already small populations belonging to the M haplogroup were not able to survive these changes in their habitat, and a new population, carrying the N subtype, replaced the M-group ice-age holdout, the researchers speculate.

Exactly where these replacements came from is still a mystery. But one possibility is that the newer generation of Europeans hailed from southern European refugia that were connected to the rest of Europe once the ice receded, Posth speculated. Emigrants from southern Europe would also have been better adapted to the warming conditions in central Europe, he added.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Feds: Still hope for El Nino drenching Southern California,[],"Even though Southern California hasn't gotten the drought-busting rainy windfall some might have expected from El Nino, federal scientists hold out hope for the next several weeks.

Central and Northern California have gotten more heavy rain, especially in recent weeks. Southern California hasn't quite been so soaked. But National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration scientists say their turn may still yet come.

Traditionally Southern California gets its downpours from El Ninos later, in the spring, said NOAA research scientist Martin Hoerling. El Nino is the natural warming of parts of the equatorial Pacific that changes weather worldwide, including often bringing more rain to California, where it is needed after four years of drought.

In the Southern California spring during an El Nino, ""the odds of being very wet double,"" Hoerling said in a NOAA webinar. So the absence of lots of rain in the region ""shouldn't be overly alarming.""

There's still six to eight more weeks, Hoerling said.

""We're still holding out hope"" for late snow to add to melting and diminished snow packs that are crucial for water storage, added NOAA scientist Sarah Kapnick.

But some of the numbers aren't too hopeful. Water managers judge a season by how much is water available from snowpack on April 1, and after a drought like California has been through, it is best to be more than 100 percent of what is needed to get the region through the summer and fall. Northern California has 86 percent. Statewide, the snowpack average is 79 percent.

Making matters worse, she said, record warmth has caused snow to melt early, hurting water storage even more. And statewide reservoirs are at 72 percent of average.

Still, Southern California gets much of its water from the north, where some mountain ranges are full of snow and some reservoirs are well above normal, Hoerling said.

But they both said this strong El Nino hasn't quite measured up to past big ones when it comes to providing rain and snow. And the precipitation is needed more than ever because California suffered through a record, four-year drought, they said.

Each El Nino is different and ""while it shifts the odds (in favor of lots of rain) it doesn't guarantee an outcome,"" Hoerling said.

Some forecasts are calling for El Nino to end in coming months with the possibility of a flip side, a La Nina, in the fall. Historically, that has meant snow in California decreases and it increases further north, Kapnick said.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Havana prepares for historic concert by the Rolling Stones,[],"Preparing the stage for the Rolling Stones' March 25 free concert in the Cuban capital is now underway at Havana's Ciudad Deportiva, where some 200,000 fans of the British band are expected to gather for the historic show.

Members of the multinational team building the backstage told EFE that work began Monday to erect the imposing stage setting, which will measure some 80 meters (195 feet) long and 20 meters (66 feet) high, and whose components were shipped to the island in more than 60 containers.

Preparations for the massive show have become ""a great challenge,"" the vice president of the Cuban Institute of Music, Osmani Lopez, said in an article published Tuesday in the Communist Party daily Granma.

With expectations of a huge turnout, Lopez said they have ""created the conditions"" so the audience can ""enjoy the show in a wonderful atmosphere.""

Rumors about a possible Rolling Stones concert in Cuba have swirled since band frontman Mick Jagger made a private visit to the island last October.

The legendary band's first-ever performance in Cuba will take place at Havana's Ciudad Deportiva just days after Barack Obama becomes the first sitting U.S. president to visit the island since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.

Researchers at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center analyzed data including dietary habits and health history of 1,905 participants with lung cancer and 2,413 healthy controls who were part of an ongoing lung cancer study at the center, Medical News Today reported. They found that those with the highest consumption of GI foods had a 49 percent greater risk for lung cancer and a 92 percent higher risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the lung which makes up 25 to 30 percent of lung cancers.

For non-smokers, those with the highest consumption of GI foods had a 81 percent risk of developing lung cancer, compared to those in the lowest group.

Researchers noted that they were unable to determine whether subjects had diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease but believe their findings warrant further investigation.

High-GI foods include white bread, short grain white rice, melon and pineapple. Low-GI foods include sweet potato, corn, legumes and lentils. GI indicates the carbohydrate level in foods and the rate at which it will affect blood glucose levels.

Typically, GI is used for diabetes management and prevention.

foxnews.com,2015-07-09 00:00:00,Wave of Chinese companies halt stock trading as market tumbles in bid to stem losses,[],"Faced with a stomach-turning slide in share prices, many Chinese companies are taking matters into their own hands with a tactic that experts say is bound to backfire: they're pressing the pause button.

About half of the 2,800 stocks on mainland Chinese markets have been suspended from trading as companies attempt to stem further losses by sitting out the market upheaval.

The trading halts appear to be separate from the flurry of measures rolled out by Beijing over the past week, as the country's Communist leaders made increasingly desperate attempts to stabilize tumbling markets.

The Shanghai Composite Index has dived about 30 percent from its June 12 peak. The steep decline comes after a spectacular rally that sent the Shanghai index up 150 percent in the previous 12 months despite slowing growth in the world's second biggest economy.

The government fanned the rally by sending encouraging signals through state media that enticed the Chinese public to pile in to the market. But the ensuing downturn and Beijing's frantic response, which includes banning major shareholders from selling stakes for six months, highlights the limits of its control over the market.

Experts said the wave of trading suspensions could have the opposite of the intended effect. Instead of stabilizing the market, they could add to the selling pressure by transferring it to other shares that remain active.

It's a naive strategy that shows ""how immature the China market is,"" said Jackson Wong, an associate director at United Simsen Securities.

Ordinary Chinese investors have mixed feelings about the trading halts.

""I'm worried and happy at the same time,"" said Shanghai resident Ella Hong, who plowed 300,000 yuan ($31,400) into six companies starting in May, just before the market turned.

Trading in half of those stocks is now frozen, including two companies whose share prices have dropped by more than half.

""What I'm happy about is that they would not lose more in these next few days,"" said Hong. ""But what I'm worried about is that I heard once the stock comes back to the market, it would drop anyway.""

Her shares of seafood processor Shandong Oriental Ocean Sci-Tech Co. are stuck at 14.01 yuan after she bought them for 35 yuan. And her shares of hydraulic machinery maker Fujian Haiyuan Automatic Equipments Co., which she bought for 32 yuan a share, are stopped at 12.28 yuan. Both said this week they temporarily suspending trading pending the release of ""relevant information,"" which they have not yet disclosed.

Hong said she turned to the rest of her portfolio and dumped half of those shares at a big loss. She started playing the market after seeing many other people making quick money and chose stocks based on recommendations from an astrologer and a friend with investing experience.

Her experience illustrates how China's novice investors tend to be the biggest losers in the event of a market meltdown.

That was the case in the 2007-08 market boom and bust, in which China's stock market plunged 70 percent. The boom was a windfall for Chinese companies and big investors who sold before the peak. Small investors who piled in late suffered huge losses.

Most of the companies that have suspended trading are smaller businesses listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange. These firms have been hit harder than the big state firms listed in Shanghai because they don't benefit as much from recent government support measures, such as a plan for brokerages to buy stocks.

The Shanghai Composite Index rebounded 5.8 percent on Thursday, continuing a pattern of roller-coaster trading. The market turmoil is rattling neighboring markets. Hong Kong's benchmark tumbled as much as 8.5 percent on Wednesday. However it's unlikely to seriously affect U.S. investors because they have limited involvement in China's largely hermetic markets.

Analysts say the trading halts will make the Chinese markets more volatile in coming days.

""If you hold other shares, you think: quick, sell them now before those are frozen,"" said Michael Every, head of Asia-Pacific financial market research at Rabobank. ""Anything you hold could be frozen at an unrealistic level and you can't get out.""

""There's no easy solution to this but China still seems to think there's a command-economy way to control something as chaotic as an equity market. And there really isn't,"" he said.

China is also revealing to global investors that its markets aren't fully developed, analysts said. For example, index compiler MSCI's recent decision to delay China's inclusion in its global benchmarks, which would have spurred more capital into the country's markets, now seems justified.

Anyone who was upset about the decision last month is now ""probably thinking what a bullet they dodged,"" said Every.

With so many shares suspended from trading, many market watchers have suggested, partly in jest, that China completely shut its exchanges to let everyone cool off.

History suggests that won't be a cure either.

Hong Kong's stock exchange closed for four days after the Black Friday global market crash in October 1987. When it reopened, the benchmark Hang Seng index plunged 43 percent, an event that spurred fundamental changes aimed at better protecting investors.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,'A demon ate the Sun' How solar eclipses inspired superstition,[],"The first and only total solar eclipse of 2016 will roll across the sky this week. Total solar eclipses  when the moon's shadow blocks the sun entirely  are spectacular events, highly anticipated by astronomers, astrophotographers and casual spectators alike.

But it wasn't always that way.

The gradual darkening of the sun was once cause for alarm, linked to evil auguries or the activity of the gods. Throughout history, cultures around the world sought to provide context and explanation for eclipses, and like the eclipses themselves, the legends attached to the events were dramatic. [Sun Shots: Amazing Eclipse Images]

Left in the dark

This week's total solar eclipse will be visible from Indonesia and from the North Pacific Ocean early on Wednesday (March 9) local time, (late Tuesday, March 8, EST). During the celestial event, the sun is expected to be completely obscured for 4 minutes and 9.5 seconds.

Total solar eclipses occur when the moon's umbral shadow, the innermost and darkest part, is cast over the sun at a specific point during the moon's orbit: when it is close enough to Earth that the shadow completely obscures the sun's light. Witnessed firsthand, the effect is unsettling: The sky is gradually overcome by a creeping darkness that is jarringly out of sync with the familiar rhythms of day and night.

And for many ancient peoples, that meant one thing  trouble, said Edwin C. Krupp, astronomer and director of the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles.

The word ""eclipse"" is derived from the Greek term ""ekleipsis,"" meaning ""an abandonment,"" Krupp wrote in his book, ""Beyond the Blue Horizon: Myths and Legends of the Sun, Moon, Stars and Planets."" And during an eclipse, when the sun ""abandoned"" people to the darkness, many responded with terror and anticipation of disaster.

Krupp detailed a 16th-century account of Aztecs in central Mexico written by a Spanish missionary named Fray Bernardino de Sahagun, who described people reacting to an eclipse with ""a tumult and disorder.""

""There was shouting everywhere. People of light complexion were slain [as sacrifices],"" de Sahagun wrote, according to Krupp, adding, ""It was thus said: 'If the eclipse of the sun is complete, it will be dark forever! The demons of darkness will come down. They will eat men.'"" [The Surprising Origins of 9 Common Superstitions]

Krupp also relayed an account from ancient Mesopotamia, in which it was said that an eclipse heralded that ""an all-powerful king would die,"" and that ""a flood will come and Ramman [the storm and weather god] will diminish the crops of the land.""

And in Australia, eclipses were viewed negatively by many  but not all  Aboriginal groups, ""frequently associating them with bad omens, evil magic, disease, blood and death,"" said a study published in July 2011 in the Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage. Medicine men and community elders would try to counteract an eclipse's evil portents by chanting, singing, and throwing sacred or magical objects toward the sun, the authors explained.

Swallowing the sun

Many cultures attributed the sun's partial or total disappearance to hungry demons or gods with runaway appetites. Krupp detailed Mayan glyphs that hinted at a giant serpent swallowing the sun during an eclipse. Chinese and Armenian tales referred to dragons, while Hungarians claimed a giant bird was the culprit. The Buryats, an indigenous group in southern Siberia, blamed a giant bear, and the Shan people in what is now Vietnam described the sun-swallower as an evil spirit that took the form of a toad. [The 7 Most Famous Solar Eclipses in History]

For the Vikings, eclipses were caused by a sky wolf, whose name, Skoll, meant ""repulsion."" People would attempt to retrieve the temporarily stolen sun by making as much noise as possible, so as to scare the wolf into abandoning his meal, according to the 13th-century Icelandic author Snorri Sturluson, who wrote the book ""Tales from Norse Mythology.""

And some of these sun-eaters took even more monstrous forms, Krupp recounted. Yugoslavians linked solar eclipses to a type of werewolf called the vukodlak, while western Siberia's Tatars told of a vampire that tried to swallow the sun and failed after burning his tongue. In Korea, the king of the ""Land of Darkness"" tasked his Fire Dogs with stealing the sun to brighten his gloomy domain.

In the ancient Indian poem ""Mahabharata,"" the head of the demon Rahu  decapitated by the god Vishnu for drinking an immortality potion  pursued the sun that betrayed him, seeking to swallow it. But even when Rahu succeeded, it was only a matter of time before the sun re-appeared, passing through the demon's severed throat, Krupp explained.

Cosmic coupling

Other stories about eclipses assign a role to the moon in the sun's disappearance, according to Jarita Holbrook, a physics professor at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa and editor of the book ""African Cultural Astronomy.""

""Mesoamerica and parts of Africa describe the sun and moon fighting during eclipses. Then there is the marriage of sun and moon among some of the North Americans. The marriage of sun and moon is often an act of creation in myths,"" Holbrook told Live Science in an email.

Holbrook explained that during the unfamiliar darkness of a solar eclipse, certain planets and stars could become visible, fueling myths that a cosmic coupling of sun and moon resulted in ""births"" of other objects in the sky.

""During the totality of a total solar eclipse, these bright points of light appear, only to disappear as totality ends,"" Holbrook said. ""I can see how our ancient ancestors conceived of total solar eclipses as both a marriage and [a union] with the creation of stellar children.""

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Florida mayor plans to travel from Cuba to U.S. on makeshift raft,[],"Despite warnings against the journey from the U.S. Coast Guard, a Florida mayor says he's determined to return home from a visit to Cuba alone in a makeshift raft.

DeBary Mayor Clint Johnson said Tuesday he devised his plan to better understand what Cuban migrants experience when crossing the Florida Straits.

Johnson plans to fly into Havana next month with some pieces for the raft and assemble it there with more pieces he can acquire locally.

While he says he will heed a Coast Guard warning to carry an emergency beacon that can broadcast his location, he insists his that his raft will be powered only by currents and not a motor.

""I don't want to get too far away from the purpose of doing this,"" Johnson said. ""I want to understand what the people have gone through when they came here on a raft.""

The number of Cubans making their own way illegally across those waters has surged for over a year amid concerns that special immigration privileges for Cubans may soon end. Under the policy known as ""wet foot/dry foot,"" Cubans who reach U.S. shore generally can stay and pursue citizenship, while those caught at sea are returned home.

Since Oct. 1, the Coast Guard estimates that over 2,200 Cubans have attempted the voyage. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, nearly 4,500 Cuban migrants were kept from reaching U.S. shores  a sharp increase over previous years. Thousands more Cubans are attempting to reach the U.S. over land through Central America.

Officials with the Coast Guard's 7th District in Miami routinely warn would-be migrants in Cuba and Haiti, and their families in the U.S., that an undetermined number of people have died attempting to make illegal crossings to the United States. They now have issued the same warning to Johnson.

""We respectfully urge the mayor to reconsider his trip,"" Coast Guard officials said in a statement to The Associated Press. ""Worst case, his trip may result in grave consequences.""

Reports of migrants at sea in homemade or unseaworthy vessels trigger search-and-rescue operations, and Johnson's voyage would be no different, said the Coast Guard. Officials added that such operations also put air and sea crews at risk.

Once weather and current conditions are right, Johnson plans to launch his solo journey toward Key West, under the sponsorship of Hawaiian Tropic founder Ron Rice, who lives in Ormond Beach.

He said he doesn't want to endanger rescue crews, but according to his understanding, nothing bars from making the attempt because he is a U.S. citizen returning home from an approved trip to Cuba.

""I definitely would be willing to do whatever it takes to ensure their satisfaction,"" said Johnson, whose small city lies about 25 miles north of Orlando.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Chairman McCaul: The terrorist exodus has begun and we're not ready for it,['Michael Mccaul'],"FBI Director James Comey testified before Congress in 2014 that the thousands of Western foreign fighters bound for the Middle East would one day come home as battle-hardened extremists.

There will be a terrorist diaspora out of those areasespecially Syriathat we all wake up every day thinking and worrying about, he warned.

Two years later, the exodus has begun in earnest, and we are woefully unprepared to deal with it.

More than 6,000 Westerners, including Americans, have gone to fight with groups like ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and reportedly around 2,000 of them have returnedsome to plot terrorist attacks and others to set up new extremist networks.

The reality could not be more clear: jihadists are coming home, and they are piggy-backing on the refugee flows to avoid detection.

We saw this in November with the Paris attacks, in January with a suicide bombing in Turkey against Western tourists, and in February when German authorities arrested two terror suspects for allegedly plotting an attack in Berlin.

In each of these cases, terrorists reportedly posed as Syrian refugees fleeing the war-torn country.

One international terrorism think tank has catalogued at least 40 suspected jihadists who have been caught entering Europe posing as migrants or refugees.

Indeed, the attempts are becoming so common that a top American NATO commander testified before Congress last week that terrorists and returning foreign fighters are becoming a daily part of the refugee flow into Europe. If that doesnt set off alarm bells, then I dont know what does.

This year it will only get easier for extremists to blend into the mix. The number of refugees and migrants arriving in Europe in just the past two monthsmore than 100,000has already exceeded the entire first half of last year, according to UN figures.

But we cannot pretend the problem is an ocean away. For us, the danger is a plane-flight away, as extremists are trying to infiltrate U.S. humanitarian programs, too.

Intelligence officials have notified me that possible terror suspects in Syria have already tried to enter our country as refugees.

The concerted effort by ISIS to deploy operativesusing whatever routes possibleshould come as no surprise. The group is dead set on ramping up external operations and has already been linked to 75 terrorist plots against the West, one-third targeting the United States.

ISIS members in their own words have threatened to take advantage of the Syrian refugee crisis to launch attacks, and they are clearly following through on it.

My committee will release a report next month on the issue of terrorist exploitation of refugee flows, marking the conclusion of a year-long review into the threat. The findings are concerning.

For instance, gaping security loopholes are making it easier for violent extremists to slip through the cracksand possibly get closer to our homeland. Nowhere is this clearer than in Europe, where the continents open borders have become a cause celebre for jihadists.

There are no real controls, one diplomat in the region explained to us, adding that authorities take fingerprints, accept whatever identification they provideif they have oneand send them on their way. My Committee found many countries were not checking this information against counterterrorism databases.

This is inexcusable. If foreign governments are not rigorously screening refugees against terrorist watchlists, they will likely be overlooked, putting our allies at risk and allowing extremists to get one step closer to the United States.

We cannot adopt a wait-and-see approach while jihadists ride the wave of refugees into the West. We must act.

That is why this month the House Homeland Security Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee will work to move bills through Congress to accelerate security cooperation with our overseas partnersespecially on disrupting terrorist travel. The legislation would help our allies put better counterterrorism checks in place and focus U.S. assistance on the highest-risk countries.

We also need to strengthen our defenses here at home.

In November, the House voted on a bill I co-authored with Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., the American SAFE Act, to enhance screening of Syrian and Iraqi refugees to weed out terror suspects. The legislation, which passed with a bipartisan veto-proof majority, does not shut the door on refugees; instead, it adds additional layers of security to the process for the highest-risk refugee categories.

Yet the president has pressured Democrats to stall this bill in the Senate. At a time when our enemies are targeting refugee routes to sneak into our country, I am worried that delay could be deadly.

Already this year two ISIS-linked Iraqi refugees were arrested in the United States on terror charges, one of which had reportedly returned from fighting in Syria.

Ultimately, the real security gap we must close is the leadership vacuum on the international stage. Hesitancy and half-measures have allowed Syria to become a jihadist powder keg, and lack of American leadership has encouraged Russia and Iran to fan the flames.

This is a humanitarian catastrophe, to be sure. But if we dont get more assertive in resolving the crisis, it will be remembered for becoming a terrorist Trojan Horse.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Top 9 Reasons Appraisals Come in Low,[],"Unfortunately, it happens: A low appraisal can n already bumpy home-buying process. Suddenly, you find yourself in a conundrum: Your bank will fund a loan only up to the appraised value. So do you walk away from the sale? Do you fork over more money to cover the difference? Do you crawl into the corner of the apartment you fear you'll rent forever and cry your little eyes out?

We know you have home-buying agita -- and we're here to help. There are ways to deal with a low appraisal -- but only if you know why it happened.

Behold the 10 most common reasons for a low appraisal, according to our expert sources.

1. The appraiser doesn't do a neighborhood deep-dive

To appraise the value of a property, appraisers rely heavily on comps, which are prices paid for similar homes sold recently. But the appraiser could select comps of homes that sold for mysteriously low prices.

Appraisers don't normally officially inspect the comps, says Peter Grabel, managing director of Luxury Mortgage in Stamford, CT. They wouldn't know if there was a mold issue, asbestos, or a nasty divorce that led to a quick below-market sale of a comparable home, skewing the analysis.

2. The appraiser has to go outside the hood

Sometimes there isn't enough data on sales of similar homes in the area, forcing the appraiser to use comps from a nearby -- and possibly less desirable -- community, Grabel says. Ideal comps should be similar in style, size, location, and view.

3. The importance of the view

Does your home have a knockout view -- or, at least, one that's better than the comp down the street that overlooks unsightly power lines? If so, make sure your appraiser knows it, too. If the difference in view is not obvious, your home could appraise for lower than expected.

4. A gorgeous basement

The house has a large, beautiful finished basement with a bedroom and a bathroom. You've doubled your square footage. Score! Unfortunately, appraisers are required to use much lower value per square foot for space below ground.

5. The extras that totally sold you aren't selling the appraiser

Surprisingly, a pool, tennis court, and high-end landscaping are attractive features, but they frequently don't lead to significantly higher valuation on appraisals. Here's why: When an appraiser compares two otherwise identical homes, one with the amenities and one without, the difference in their selling price is typically not nearly as much as the cost of adding these features -- especially when the amenities are of better quality than is standard for the area.

For example, if you spend $200,000 to install a pool, but other homes in neighborhood have $50,000 pools, the difference in quality is not likely to appraise well. So be prepared for a lower value than expected if the property has one or more of these types of features.

6. The condo is the best in the building

Upgrades and finishes might not always boost the value of your home. This is particularly true of co-ops and condos, where the square footage plays a major role in value.

""Let's say you are buying Unit 15A, which has a brand-new, top-of-the-line kitchen, much nicer than is customary in this type of building,"" Grabel explains. ""Units 15B and 15C recently sold for less. They are exactly the same size and have new kitchens but were not done to the same quality. An appraiser can make adjustments, but it will be a challenge for your unit to get the valuation that you might think it is worth.""

7. The market is too hot to keep up with

Home prices in the area might be increasing so quickly that the comps that sold six months ago don't yet reflect this improvement.

""In Brooklyn and in Harlem, for example, prices are soaring, properties are selling for a record price per foot,"" Grabel says.

""If six months ago the top price was $1,000 per foot but you are paying $1,100 per foot, there are no recorded comps at that price for an appraiser to use.""

Appraisals, by their nature, are backward-looking. You can ask the appraiser to make a ""market adjustment,"" but they don't have to do it.

8. You intentionally overpaid

There are many reasons you might overpay for a home: You might just fall in love with the place and want to make sure you get it -- at any cost.

""During prime selling season, bidding wars erupt left and right,"" Grabel says. ""And the downside to winning one is the reality of getting financed on that final price.""

Remember, the bank is going to lend only the appraised fair market value, and not the higher price you might think it's worth. So you'll be left paying the difference yourself.

It's an emotional choice, and we're not here to judge. But your appraiser will, and just beware: What the appraiser says (usually) goes.

9. The appraiser is inexperienced -- or just bad

Sometimes, it really does come down to a job not well done. The appraiser could be unfamiliar with the nuances of the local market or might simply rush through the job. Unfortunately, a home buyer obtaining a mortgage has no control over the appraisal selection process -- your lender is the one who orders the appraisal, either directly from an appraiser or through an appraisal management company.

""We actually choose to pay for appraisals so that we can limit our pool to only the top appraisers,"" Grabel says. ""This is not a guarantee that the value will come in where we need it to, but it typically ensures a good quality report from an experienced appraiser.""

Worried about getting a dud? You can ask your lender how it selects appraisers or if there's a particular company it uses -- then do your homework.",[]

Jenkins, one of the NFL's top cornerbacks, expects to sign a five-year deal worth about $60 million later Wednesday. The free-agent signing period begins at 4 p.m. EST.

The move comes a day after the Giants agreed on a deal with unrestricted defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul.

Jenkins' signing will likely mean the end of Prince Amukamara's Giants career. The former 2011 first-round cornerback was told by the Giants to test the open market.

Jenkins' agent Malik Shareef did not return phone messages.

In Jenkins, the Giants will gain a durable, productive cornerback they can pair with returning left cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie to provide immediate help to the league's worst pass defense.

Jenkins 10 interceptions and 35 pass breakups since 2012.

The one-bedroom cottage offers 572 compact square feet of living space and miles and miles of outdoor living just steps away.

Built in 1913, the tiny home has been fully renovated and offers -- rare for such a small house -- a kitchen with full-size stove and refrigerator, a large sink, and enough counter space for most basic prep work.

Before its recent remodel, the home had served as a rental and vacation home for at least 40 years, leaving it ""not up to snuff for someone buying it to live in,"" says listing agent Rachel Buller. But with a new roof, new paint, and new deck, it's in perfect condition for a single person or couple looking for Colorado outdoor living in a small footprint.

Despite its tiny size, the home is not lacking in storage space. The property features a 158-square-foot basement divided into two rooms -- one of which is used for storage.

And although the basement is accessible only through an exterior staircase, you don't need to haul baskets of laundry down the stairs to reach the utility closet -- the other downstairs space.

""The current owners built a cute little clothes chute from the bedroom to get dirty clothes right down to the laundry room,"" says Buller.

Located just 1.5 miles from the Pikes Peak Cog Railway, this little home also provides a five-star view of the famous fourteener -- a mountain that tops 14,000 feet -- through the bedroom window.

But that's certainly not the only entertainment in the area. This small city west of Colorado Springs is a ""walkable community,"" says Buller. Whether you're looking to walk or hike, trails are nearby. The cottage's location in Manitou Springs Historic District is only three blocks from its downtown core and one block from the trail system.

You've even got some outdoor space of your own: While no one could consider the backyard voluminous, there's plenty of room to grill and entertain on the 1,664-square-foot lot -- or even set up your own tiny garden. Basement storage space not enough? Build a shed out back to keep your extras in place. Just keep your eye on city regulations: The historic district has rules limiting ""any material change of appearance.""

When you're this close to the wilds of nature, who needs a bigger floor plan? For an outdoor enthusiast, this tiny cottage is more than enough.",[]

(Photo by Juan Naharro Gimenez/Getty Images)2016 Getty Images

Peruvian-born novelist and essayist, Mario Vargas Llosa will receive the Living Legend Award from the Library of Congress in Washington D.C. on April 11.

In 2010, Llosa was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, topping off a career that helped kick-start a worldwide explosion in South American literature in the 1960s and 70s.

The author is best-known for such politically charged novels such as The Feast of the Goat and The War of the End of the World.

At one point Vargas Llosa launched a failed presidential bid and historically maintained an ongoing fuel with Nobel laureate, Gabriel Garcia Marquez.

""Mario Vargas Llosa has brought to life the history and character of the Latin American people in memorable literature that has been translated into many languages around the world,"" said Acting Librarian of Congress David S. Mao. ""The Library of Congress is proud to honor him and his work.""

Born in 1936, in Arequipa, he began his career working as a crime reporter for the Lima newspaper, La Cronica at the age of 15.

At 19, he eloped with his aunt by marriage, Julia Urquidi, 32. He moved to Paris in 1959, then later to London and Barcelona, working as a Spanish teacher, broadcaster and journalist in various universities in Europe.

He returned to Peru in 1975.

A prolific writer, his novels, short stories and plays fortified his literary standing and eventually led to his turn in politics. He hosted a Peruvian talk show, and in 1987 he led protests against a plan to nationalize the Peruvian financial system, leading to a presidential bid.

""The Feast of the Goat"" (2002) is viewed widely as a tour de force; it offers a profile of Rafael L Trujillo Molina, who ruled the Dominican Republic from 1930 to 1961. The novel surrounds Trujillos efforts to have sex with the 14-year-old daughter of his chief minister, and his assassination two weeks later.

He has described it as a ""realist treatment of a human being who became a monster"", adding that he is distrustful of ""the idea that you can build a paradise here in history. That idea of a perfect society lies behind monsters like the Taliban. When you want paradise you produce first extraordinary idealism. But at some time, you produce hell.""

The Library of Congress award ceremony is open to the public.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Sanders camp sees opportunity as Southern state voting wraps,[],"Bernie Sanders is showing no signs of slowing down after pulling off an upset victory in Michigan and sees an opportunity ahead to gain ground, as his campaign suggests one of Hillary Clintons biggest built-in advantages is about to become irrelevant.

To date, Clintons firewall of Southern states has delivered her a string of victories, most recently in Mississippi. Across the Deep South, black voters who make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate there went overwhelmingly for Clinton.

But after Florida and North Carolina hold primaries next Tuesday, the Southern states are done voting. The map shifts to the Midwest and beyond  and in those states, the black voting bloc is not so large.

Sanders, who closed what virtually every pre-election poll showed was a double-digit deficit against Clinton in Michigan, made clear after his surprise victory that hes looking to repeat that success in other Rust Belt states starting next week.

We look forward to going to Illinois, Ohio, Missouri and the other states, Sanders told reporters.

Sanders upset win in Michigan could fuel tensions Wednesday night at a debate being held at Miami Dade College.

The two already were meeting with their manners in question. The competitors cranked through their previous face-off just days earlier and emerged complaining of disrespectful conduct.

Now, Sanders sees an opening and Clinton is more determined than ever to clear him out of the way.

Sanders campaign officials made the case Tuesday night that the Vermont senators attacks on Clintons support for free trade deals had an impact in the Michigan race, and likely will be effective in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri. And they maintained that Clintons advantage in the South goes away after next Tuesday, as rural voters in other states, including the West, taking a closer look at their candidate.

Among the upcoming contests are Utah, Idaho, Arizona and Washington state.

To date, Clinton has been helped immensely by her dominating performance in Southern states, where minority voters overwhelmingly broke for her.

And thanks to their support  and just as important, the support of unpledged superdelegates -- Clinton still enjoys a huge overall delegate lead. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri stressed Tuesday that their campaigns strategy focuses on winning delegates, and noted theyd pick up more delegates than Sanders from Tuesdays contests regardless of the Michigan results.

As of Wednesday afternoon, Clinton had 1,221 delegates to Sanders 571. The former secretary of states advantage remains daunting for her insurgent rival.

Even as Sanders looks to the Midwest and West for support, both campaigns will compete next week for Florida, where polls show Clinton well ahead.

But before those delegates are at play, Clinton and Sanders will meet for their eighth debate in the Sunshine State where 99 Democratic delegates are at stake, as well as bragging rights in the most hotly contested battleground in U.S. politics.

Floridians have picked President Obama in the past two elections, and former President George W. Bush twice before that. The Sunshine State is also home to the infamous hanging chad election drama of 2000, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided the race in Bushs favor.

Wednesdays one-on-one will be hosted by Univision News and The Washington Post, and aired on CNN.

Coming less than 24 hours after Sanders Michigan win, the debate gives both candidates a chance to make their case to a key voting demographic  the Latino community  and tackle controversial issues like immigration reform and border security.

Clinton is expected to press Sanders on his comment from their last debate which critics said made it sound as though only non-whites live in poverty. When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto, you don't know what it's like to be poor, he said.

Sanders, who has tried to make inroads with black voters, sought to mop up after the debate by saying he only meant that many white people aren't aware of the pressures and police oppression facing black Americans.

He also bristled: ""I don't want to be lectured about talking poverty whether it's white, black, Latino. Nobody in this campaign has talked about it more.""

The candidates are also likely to take on police, race and gun violence.

The death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was killed in 2012 in Sanford, Fla., during an altercation with neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, remains a wound that won't heal among blacks. Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder.

Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, has campaigned with Clinton to reduce gun violence. And Clinton has gone after Sanders for voting against longer waiting periods for gun purchases.

Another prickly topic up for debate is health care.

More than 1.7 million Floridians have enrolled in Obama's health care law this year, with South Florida having one of the highest enrollment levels in the nation.

Clinton supports the law and wants to fix it. Sanders wants to push for universal health care in a government-financed system.

After Luke Skywalker got his hand cut off during a duel with Darth Vader in ""Star Wars,"" the young Jedi received an artificial hand that helped him both grip and feel again. Scientists worldwide are seeking to make this vision from science fiction a reality with prosthetic limbs that are wired directly into the nervous systems of their recipients.

Researchers experimented with amputee Dennis Aabo Srensen from Denmark, who damaged his left hand more than a decade ago while playing with fireworks. Doctors immediately amputated the appendage after Srensen was brought to a hospital. [Bionic Humans: Top 10 Technologies]

""I still feel my missing hand  it is always clenched in a fist,"" Srensen said in a statement.

The researchers had connected Srensen to a bionic hand that helped him to tell whether an object held in the prosthetic was soft or hard, round or square. Now the scientists wanted to see if they could improve his ability to detect more subtle characteristics, like rough or smooth textures.

""The more we are able to reach the complexity of the natural sense of touch, the more usable the device will be,"" study co-author Silvestro Micera, head of the translational neural engineering lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, told Live Science.

The researchers connected a postage-stamp-size artificial fingertip to electrodes surgically implanted to nerves in Srensen's upper left arm above his stump. A machine then ran the bionic fingertip over different pieces of plastic that were engraved with smooth or rough patterns.

Sensors in the artificial fingertip generated electrical signals that were translated into a series of electrical spikes, imitating the language of the nervous system. These spikes were then delivered to Srensen's nerves.

""One of the most amazing things we saw during the experiments was the fastness of the learning process,"" said lead study author Calogero Oddo, a bioengineer at the Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies' BioRobotics Institute in Pisa, Italy. ""Dennis [Srensen] was able to perceive texture about 15 minutes after the first delivery of electrical spikes.""

Srensen could distinguish between smooth and rough surfaces 96 percent of the time, making him the first person in the world to recognize texture using a bionic device, the researchers said. [Body Beautiful: The 5 Strangest Prosthetic Limbs]

""The stimulation felt almost like what I would feel with my hand,"" Srensen said in the statement. ""I felt the texture sensations at the tip of the index finger of my phantom hand.""

The researchers also experimented with non-amputees who were temporarily attached to the artificial fingertip through electrodes stuck into nerves in their arms. These volunteers were able to distinguish between rough and smooth textures only about 77 percent of the time. Srensen probably did better than the non-amputee volunteers because the electrodes were surgically implanted into the amputee's nerves, whereas they were not as securely attached to those of the non-amputees, Oddo said.

When the researchers scanned the brains of both Srensen and the non-amputee volunteers, they found that Srensen's brain activity while using the artificial fingertip was analogous to that of non-amputees using their own fingers. This suggests the sensations from the bionic fingertip accurately resemble the feeling of touch from real fingers, the scientists said.

The researchers have already integrated the new fingertip into a prosthetic hand. Micera said they plan for patients to use this advanced bionic device in experiments before the end of 2016.

""Hopefully, we will have proof of long-term use in two to three years and transfer to clinical practice in five to 10,"" Micera said.

Currently, the fingertip can discern textures on a millimeter scale, Oddo said. ""When it comes to discriminating a piece of wood from a piece of paper, a piece of cotton, a piece of silk, and so on, those materials differ on an even finer level, on a micron level,"" Oddo told Live Science. He added that they have developed an artificial fingertip that can discriminate such fine textures, and they hope to have patients test it on items such as clothes.

The scientists detailed their findings online today (March 8) in the journal eLife.

When Madeleine McCann, 3, disappeared in May 2007, it caused headlines around the world, with her distraught parents coming under suspicion right after she vanished.

As the weeks passed and no evidence about the case emerged, finding Madeleine became a national obsession in England and Portugal, and a number of theories began to circulate. One had it that she was abducted and trafficked to a childless couple on another continent.

Last weekend, a man named Miraz Ullah Ali Isa, who identified himself as an English private eye, told the Ascuncion newspaper ABC Color, My team and I received information that Madeleine arrived in Paraguay a month or two ago.

He added that Madeleine was in the custody of a woman in the town of Aregua, about 17 miles from the capital city of Asuncion.

But the reports were discounted by inspector Luis Ignacio Arias of Interpol in Paraguay, who told EFE on Tuesday that his office had no information on Isa's identity or any clues about the girl's supposed whereabouts in the South American country.

""There's nothing concrete about that person,"" Arias said, referring to Isa, adding that he never contacted the National Police or the Foreign Ministry.

The countrys vice minister of interior security, Jalil Rachid, told Radio Monumental, The information we have is that no, the missing girl was not to be found in Aregua. He added that the would-be investigator obviously left with empty hands.

Isa declined to tell ABC Color the name of his investigative firm, nor was he able to provide any documentation showing that he was an investigator, the newspaper reported.

In its original article, the paper further discredited Isas story by pointing out that he only stayed [in the country] a couple of days and didnt speak with anyone.

Interpols Arias told EFE that Paraguays National Police said it will launch an investigation into the supposed detective's story and into his identity.

When she disappeared, Madeleine was sleeping with her twin brothers in an apartment in the town of Praia da Luz, in the Algarve section of Portugal, while her parents were dining with friends at a nearby restaurant. Madeleines brothers were undisturbed.

The parents then initiated a massive search to try to find their daughter, which has never officially ended.

Last month, her mother held a press conference saying that she did not believe her daughter was ever taken out of Algarve.

Thats where she last was and I dont think shes been taken a million miles from there. Ive always said Praia da Luz is the place where I feel closest to her.

The total solar eclipse of March 2016 is the only total eclipse of the sun of the year. The last one occurred in March 2015 and this time around the moon's shadow will travel across the Earth late Tuesday (March 8), for the Pacific, and early Wednesday (March 9) in Indonesia. (Strangely, because of the international dateline, this actually happens in the opposite order  it starts off over Indonesia and travels eastward across the Pacific Ocean; it will be Tuesday for about the last third of its journey.) So while its timing is firm, you'll need to check a list to tell when exactly to look out for a full or partial eclipse.

Remember, do not look directly at the sun with the naked eye or a telescope  you can use special eclipse-viewing glasses or build a pinhole projector. Solar Eclipses: An Observer's Guide (Infographic )

The asteroid's arrival is uncertain in a different way: researchers originally thought the asteroid flyby would be Saturday (March 5), but updated their predictionin late February. The asteroid should pass by about 3 million miles from Earth, but there's a possibility it will approach as close as 15,000 miles, NASA officials said in a statement.

If you're not lucky enough to live in the right geographical area to see either a total solar eclipse, where the moon entirely blots out the sun, or a partial one, where a dark bite is taken out of it, you can still watch the process live in a webcast hosted by the Slooh Community Observatory. The Slooh broadcast will begin March 8 at 6 p.m. ET and will stretch until 9 p.m. ET. You can also watch the webcast live on Space.com, courtesy of Slooh.

NASA will host its own solar eclipse webcast starting at 8 p.m. ET on NASA TV, and they will have a variety of events lined up to explore the research they'll do during the eclipse: NASA scientists will be answering questions on Twitter, Google+, Facebook and Instagram with the hashtag #eclipse 2016, and they'll be tweeting with the account @NASASunEarth.

For those hoping to observe the passing asteroid, 2013 TX68, live coverage has not yet been announced  but NASA officials said in their statement that it would likely be very dim and difficult to observe due to the distance from Earth. It last flew by Earth two years ago at a distance of 1.3 million miles.

The system could prove invaluable for airdrops in difficult terrain and urban environments, researchers say.

The military has been working for years to boost the accuracy of its airdrops when resupplying troops. As part of this effort, the Joint Precision Airdrop System (JPADS), which uses GPS, an onboard computer and a steerable parachute, was developed in 2006. The technology was deployed in the field three years  it accounted for about 1 percent of the total airdrops conducted by the U.S. Air Force in Afghanistan.

Now, the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Research, Development and Engineering Center (NSRDEC) is working on an even more accurate airdrop alternative to GPS as part of an ambitious multi-service project.

""In some terrains, such as steep canyons, or urban settings with tall buildings, you can lose GPS - these are gliding systems, so they can't fly up in altitude."" Richard Benney, Director of the Aerial Delivery Directorate at NSRDEC, told FoxNews.com. We're researching and testing what we call a video navigation system  currently it's simply a camera that's looking down and out towards the ground in the direction of flight.""

Benney explained that the video navigation system picks up targets, such as reference points or features in the local landscape. We will probably feed the JPADS an image just before it's deployed out of the aircraft from the USAF JPADS mission planner, he said. The image can come from a satellite, UAS [Unmanned Aerial System] or other sources - it will tell the JPADS 'your job is to land on that pixel'.

The as-yet unnamed video navigation system is currently being tested in desert environments and there are plans to upgrade the JPADS fleet with the new technology over the next three to five years.

The video navigation technology will eventually guide a wide range of payloads to their intended targets. There are two variants of JPADS  a 2K version that handles weights from 700 pounds up to 2,200 pounds and a 10K version for weights from 5,000 pounds to 10,000 pounds.

Benney explained that 2Ks can be dropped from as low as 3,500 feet and up to 25,000 feet, whereas 10Ks are dropped between 18,000 and 25,000 feet.

Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Draper Lab, under contract with the U.S. Army, developed the JPADS flight software and is one of the lead partners on the flight vision software.

Initial indications suggest that video navigation airdrops offer an extremely high level of accuracy. The 2K requirement is to be within 150 meters [492 feet] of the target, but it's considerably better than that, Benney told FoxNews.com. [The] 10K target is [to be within] 250 meters [820 feet] for the target, but it's significantly better than that.""

It was not until World War II, when aircraft started to reach the limits of the sound barrier  although without successfully breaking the barrier into supersonic speed  that the term came into use. Now, More than 70 years later, military aircraft can routinely break through the barrier and travel at incredible speeds.

Its pretty incredible to see how the hunting demographic has changed so much, she said. Being now in a position, where I have grown up in it and I have turned it into a career, its pretty cool because companies like Under Armour and Cabela's have really jumped on board with the female hunter thing and they have realized and very much helped push along the growth of female hunters.

She admits that while growing up, her friends didnt quite understand how involved her family was in hunting and how strong her passion really was. However, today, Shockey thanks hunting for bringing her closer to her father.

I think hunting is all about family at the end of the day, she said. It took hunting to bring my dad and I really close together...I was always a mommas girl, and then I started hunting and now I am equally as close to both of them. I think thats a big part about why women are hunting because they can go hunting now with their husbands.

Shockey married hockey player Tim Brent last year and revealed her husband can hunt, and she hopes one day her children will too.

He is a far better hunter than me, she said with a laugh. Its always been my dad and I and we are hunting buddies kind of and now my husband is involved as well because its cool to see it expanding. Hopefully someday we will have kids, and we will be able to bring them out and show them. The whole purpose is you want to know where your food comes from.

Shockey explained what it is about hunting she really loves.

Its not just the travel or not just the adventure or just about killing an animal by any means, she said. Its about a whole lifestyle and part of that is preparing yourself mentally and physically for a hunt. So with me I exercise a lot and as part of the Under Armor hunt team its a lot of about fitness and health.

Shockey is sure her love for hunting will never die.

I will never be out of the hunting industry; Ive grown up with it. Its all I know. Its all I want to do with my time and Im really passionate about it.",[]

According to Louise Goldsbury of CruiseCritic.com, Celebrity Cruises sent out a letter to passengers from Captain Yannis Berdos saying that the company had been monitoring the situation since leaving Western Australia, and they had made the decision to skip Bali.

Instead of docking in Bali, the Celebrity Solstice arrived early in Darwin, Australia, where the ship was originally supposed to dock on March 10. Passengers who had booked tours in Bali will receive a refund from Celebrity Cruises, according to the cruise line.

The cruise company has been keeping tabs on security concerns in Bali, and Celebrity Cruises listened to officials from Australia and the United Kingdom regarding potential terrorist attacks that could place in Indonesia.

Captain Berdos released a statement, obtained by CruiseCritic.com, saying, The most recent information in the past few days indicate that the possibility of an incident in Bali has increased. Also, the Balinese New Year is March 9 and recent past advisories have named this date as one that could be targeted by terrorists. We will continue to monitor the security situation in Indonesia and will notify guests or their travel agents if there are changes to future sailings that visit Bali.

Celebrity Cruises also released a statement, saying, After discussion with our global security team in Miami, we have decided to cancel Celebrity Solstice's call to Bali on Monday, March 7. This decision was made in an abundance of caution, and we apologize for the impact on our guests' cruise. The safety of our guests and crew is always our foremost concern.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Marco Rubios make-or-break moment has arrived after stunning fourth-place finishes,[],"Marco Rubios make-or-break moment has arrived.

The Florida senators fourth-place finishes both in Michigan and Mississippi on Tuesday have made his challenge to stay on in hopes of overtaking Republican front-runner Donald Trump and second-place Sen. Ted Cruz much steeper.

However, he stills see salvation in his home state next week.

A loss would all but force him out of the 2016 contest  and scar his future political ambitions, should he have any.

""It has to happen here, and it has to happen now,"" he told a swelling Sarasota crowd Tuesday evening.

But it wont be easy with Trump still ahead in the polls and a late push from Cruz, who senses an opportunity to sink Rubio even if he cant win the state for himself.

""This is do-or-die for Rubio,"" said die-hard supporter Jim Wilson, who follows the young senator's campaign across the country in his pickup truck.

Suddenly reduced to a single-state strategy, Rubio's team says he will campaign in Florida and nowhere else for the next week, even as four other states also prepare to host primary elections Tuesday. At the same time, his allies are pelting Trump with an avalanche of negative ads on Florida TV that reinforce the same message Rubio and his army of volunteers offer to anyone who will listen: Trump can't be trusted

""Who I am and what I stand for is the opposite of Donald Trump,"" said 20-year-old Florida State University junior Letty Burgin, who has sacrificed this week's spring break to help save Rubio's campaign.

""Even if he's the underdog, and even if he's supposed to lose,"" Burgin said of Rubio while knocking on doors in a Tampa-area neighborhood on Tuesday, ""I will give everything I have.""

Spokesman Alex Conant says the Rubio campaign has seven fully staffed offices in the state backed by 40 full-time staffers and ""countless"" volunteers. Trump's ground game in Florida largely remains a mystery, as was the case in other states.

While he is a distant third in most polls, Cruz's campaign opened 10 Florida offices last week and boasts more than 10,000 volunteers in the state, although just a handful of people were inside Cruz's Tampa office Tuesday afternoon. A Cruz official was also dispatched to Rubio's Sarasota rally on Tuesday evening, part of a statewide ""bracketing"" operation.

""The best thing Marco Rubio can do right now is pull out before Tuesday,"" Rebecca Hagelin, the national co-chair of Women for Cruz, said as Rubio posed for pictures with giddy supporters across the room. ""He's not going to win anyway, which is going to be devastating to his career.""

By necessity, Rubio is embracing the challenge.

""I've always been an underdog. I didn't inherit money or a Rolodex from my parents,"" Rubio told hundreds of supporters in a Sarasota airplane hangar, one of many references to Trump on the night. ""My whole life I've had to scratch and claw and earn each and every step of the way.""

A win in Florida would essentially reset the race, Rubio's team says. And with at least a three-person field for the foreseeable future, they are convinced that no one will reach the 1,237 delegate threshold to secure the nomination outright before the party's national convention in July.

If Rubio loses the state, it will not be for lack of outside financial support. The pro-Rubio Conservative Solutions PAC has spent more so far on Florida advertising than the combined total of all the other campaigns and super PACs.

The group is on pace to spend nearly $7.8 million in the state, mostly on ads attacking Trump. Three other anti-Trump groups plan to spend a combined $4.2 million attacking the billionaire front-runner before the March 15 primary, according to data from Kantar Media's Campaign Media Analysis Group.

For his part, Trump has spent more than $700,000 through Tuesday and plans to spend an additional $1.3 million. Part of that spending will go into an ad called, ""Corrupt Marco,"" which criticizes Rubio for loose spending and labels him an ""all-talk, no-action politician.""

The stakes couldn't be higher, says Burgin, who knocked on 16 doors Tuesday afternoon in a Republican enclave known as Fish Hawk. Neighborhood resident, Katie Bible, was the only friendly face Burgin found. Just a handful of people answered their doors.

""There are five of us in this house voting for Marco Rubio,"" an excited Bible said. ""I'm sure as hell not voting for Donald Trump.""

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Wednesday will be pivotal to Tony Stewart's future in the No. 14,[],"It's been more than five weeks since Tony Stewart suffered a burst fracture of his L1 vertebrae when the ATV he was driving landed awkwardly while the three-time Sprint Cup Series champion vacationed with friends near the California-Arizona border.

Stewart, who has been at the track the past two weekends but continues to deal with soreness from his injury, will learn more about his future in the No. 14 Stewart-Haas Racing Chevrolet on Wednesday when he undergoes a series of x-rays on his injured back.

""That's the first time since the surgery that we'll have an update, have a progress report,"" Stewart said during a news conference last weekend at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. ""But for a month now, I haven't done anything but just kind of chill out. The doctors want me lying in bed and walking. They don't want me sitting and standing. I'm definitely breaking the rules.""

Although no timetable has been given for his return, Stewart hopes to get back behind the wheel of the car he co-owns as soon as possible in order to salvage as much as he possibly can of what will be his final season in NASCAR's top series. When he does return, Stewart also hopes that NASCAR will grant him a waiver that would make him eligible for the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup despite missing multiple races.

Last year, NASCAR waved the perfect attendance requirement on Kyle Busch but kept the requirement that the Joe Gibbs Racing driver finish the regular season in the top 30 in points to be Chase-eligible. A similar arrangement is expected to be made for Stewart, provided he returns within a reasonable timeframe. Busch missed the first 11 points races of last season with injuries.



""Whatever they decide, they decide,"" Stewart said. ""I would like to think it's going to be similar to what they did last year with Kyle. The biggest thing I'm worried about is just getting this healed properly. That's my biggest concern, is just making sure that it heals right. I'm anxious to get x-rayed because I'm very curious about what the progress has been like for the last 30 days. ... The biggest concern is just making sure it heals right the first time.""

Now state health officials are investigating whether the milk was to blame for their fever, vomiting and diarrhea, and weighing allegations the raw-milk party broke the law.

So far, state and county health officials say they haven't received medical reports of illnesses related to the dangerous bacteria that can live in raw milk, which include Campylobacter, Listeria, Salmonella and E. Coli. The lawmaker involved, Del. Scott Cadle, who also stayed home sick on Monday, blames his and other illnesses on an unrelated stomach virus circulating the Capitol.

""Everybody up there is getting it,"" said Cadle, a Mason County Republican. ""It's a stomach virus. It didn't have nothing to do with that milk.""

Some of those who got sick, including House Speaker Tim Armstead, R-Kanawha, did not drink the milk, House spokesman Jared Hunt noted.

Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin signed a bill last Thursday that will let people share milk-producing animals and drink raw milk if people sign a document acknowledging the health risks, and if the animals have passed health tests within the previous year. The law, which takes effect in late May, maintains selling and distribution bans. Selling or even offering raw milk is illegal and still will be, subject to fines of $50 to $500, unless the new requirements are met.

Tomblin, a Democrat, vetoed a similar bill last year, saying raw milk contains bacteria particularly dangerous for children, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems.

State health officials got involved after someone filed a complaint Tuesday alleging that the distribution of raw milk in the halls of the Capitol violated the law, and could have been to blame for illnesses over the weekend. Officials don't release the names of people who file complaints.

It's not clear how many people got sick, or whether any of them were tested by doctors, who are required by law to report confirmed cases to the state health department.

State Health Officer Dr. Rahul Gupta his department investigates about 200 possible outbreaks of all kinds of illnesses every year, so this one isn't unusual, nor is it confirmed.

""It's important to note that a lot of the information out there is alleged,"" Gupta said. ""It's important to conduct an investigation to figure out exactly the facts.""

Cadle said he brought in raw milk last week and drank it with friends after the governor signed the bill into law.

""I might have been breaking the law,"" Cadle told the Charleston Gazette-Mail. ""Hell, I don't know. I gave it away.""",[]

Daughter Patti Davis, dressed in black, greeted friends upon arrival at a Santa Monica mortuary where a brief service was scheduled before a motorcade was to take the casket about 45 miles to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley for the first of two days of public viewing.

Several dozen spectators gathered outside, including a few from the hospital across the street.

""She was just a very classy woman, always,"" said Jeanie Maurello, a medical assistant at Providence St. John's Health Center. ""I thought she did a wonderful job. `Just Say No' to drugs, she was behind all that.""

Another medical assistant, Lupe Salazar, said she was also an admirer. ""She did a lot of work that helped the country,"" Salazar said.

Maurello added: ""There's always a great woman behind every great man.""

Eight Secret Service agents who served the Reagans were to serve as pallbearers to transfer the casket from the funeral home to a hearse for the drive to the library in the hills northwest of Los Angeles.

Friday will be the funeral -- which was planned down to the smallest details by the former first lady herself. Just as she was always by his side in life, Nancy Reagan will be laid to rest just inches from her husband on a hillside tomb facing west toward the Pacific Ocean.

Before her death she planned the funeral's flower arrangements, the music to be played by a Marine Corps band and the people who received invitations to the private memorial.

Among those who had RSVP'd for the service were former President George W. Bush and his wife, former first lady Laura Bush; former first lady Rosalynn Carter; first lady Michelle Obama; and former first lady Hillary Clinton.

""No doubt about it, the most important of her special requests was that she be laid to rest right next to the president, as close as possible,"" said John Heubusch, executive director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation and Library.

""The way the tomb is constructed,"" he continued, ""her casket will literally be set forth in the ground inches from President Reagan's.""

The hourlong service, to which approximately 1,000 people have been invited, was to take place on the library's lawn. On a clear day the gravesite affords visitors ocean views.

Those with White House connections who have said they will attend include President Richard Nixon's daughter Tricia Nixon Cox and President Lyndon Johnson's daughters Lynda Bird Johnson Robb and Luci Baines Johnson. Other guests will include Katie Couric, Chris Matthews, Newt and Callista Gingrich, Anjelica Houston, Wayne Newton and Mr. T, the Ronald Reagan Foundation said Wednesday. Mr. T was involved in Mrs. Reagan's ""Just Say No"" anti-drug efforts during the 1980s.

Capt. Christopher Bolt, commanding officer of the USS Ronald Reagan, will also be in attendance.

""One of our saddest situations is we have so many people who have called or written, saying they would like to attend, but unfortunately it needs to be by invitation only because we only have so much room on the lawn,"" Heubusch said. ""As a result, Mrs. Reagan was very adamant about having some time where the public could come by and pay last respects.""

Public viewings are scheduled at the library from 1 to 7 p.m. on Wednesday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Thursday.

First ladies' funerals, once a quiet affair, changed significantly following the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's widow, Eleanor Roosevelt, in 1962.

Mrs. Roosevelt, a United Nations delegate, author and prominent political figure in her own right, tried to keep the event fairly quiet, limiting the guest list to 250 people, although those guests included President John F. Kennedy, former Presidents Harry Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower, and future President Lyndon Johnson. More than 1,000 mourners jammed the streets outside the church in Hyde Park, New York.

The most recent first lady's funeral was for President Gerald Ford's widow, Betty, in 2011. Some 800 people, including Mrs. Reagan, attended a private memorial service for her in Palm Springs, California, followed by a second, smaller service in her hometown of Grand Rapids, Michigan.

When former President Richard Nixon's wife, Pat, died in 1993 some 4,000 people attended a public viewing for her at the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, California. A private service took place the next day, and Mrs. Reagan and her husband were among those who attended.",[]

A defense official, who had knowledge of drone use inside the U.S. and spoke to Fox News, detailed several missions: Helping first responders extinguish forest fires in California in 2013; assisting in two search-and-rescue missions in California in 2015; helping stop recent flooding in Mississippi and South Carolina.

In those cases, requests were made by organizations such as FEMA, the California Office of Emergency Services and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers



""We felt like we could help,"" said the official, who had

knowledge of the military's drone use inside the U.S. ""We were

supporting first responders.""



But that explanation differed from the description of the drone program in a USA Today report that portrayed the unmanned aerial vehicles as being used to ""spy over U.S. territory.""



USA Today, which first reported in-depth about the flights on Wednesday, cited a Pentagon inspector general report that was recently made public by a Freedom of Information Act request as the source of most of its information.



That report said fewer than 20 such flights had occurred between 2006 and 2015 and all had been lawful.

The document provided no details of any approved mission. One example of a request, however, indicated an unidentified mayor asked the Marine Corps to fly a drone over his city to find potholes. The request was denied because it did not make operational sense.

Under 2006 guidelines established by the Pentagon, military drone use for civilian missions had to be approved by the secretary of defense or someone delegated by the secretary, USA Today reported. No defense secretaries have ever delegated that responsibility, according to the report. In 2015, those rules were altered so that only the secretary of defense could grant approval for missions, and drones could only be flown for testing or training.

Then-FBI Director Robert Mueller first revealed in 2013 testimony before Congress that drones had flown over the U.S.

Greta Van Susteren happens to be one of the people included in this small circle, with the help of Reverend Franklin Graham, and shes revealing some of the memories shes made in North Korea over the years.

In this edition of Greta Talk, Greta reminisces on some of the fascinating experiences shes had while visiting the enigmatic country, including getting a tour of the navy ship USS Pueblo by a North Korean guide who called American military cowardly, staying in a hotel straight out of The Shining, and drinking beer and singing Elvis Presley karaoke with some of her minders. Greta also recalls a highly-staged interview she was allowed to conduct with some North Korean field workers.

And why was she denied a request to visit a fourth time because it would be inappropriate for her to return?

Listen below to get the inside scoop on North Korea:

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"In briefing, Facebook's Zuckerberg asks Supreme Court to side with Obama in immigration fight",['Bryan Llenas'],"Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg, LinkedIns Reid Hoffman and more than 60 U.S. employers filed a Supreme Court brief earlier his week in support of President Barack Obamas embattled executive actions on immigration.

In it they urge the justices to support Obamas actions, aimed at temporarily protecting millions of undocumented immigrants from deportation, in a case to be heard by the high court in about a month.

The business community would benefit from policies that afford undocumented individuals - approximately 11 million in the U.S. - lawful opportunities to contribute to the U.S. economy, states the brief, spearheaded by fwd.us, a pro-immigration reform advocacy organization founded by Zuckerberg.

""Instead of inviting economic contributions of immigrants, our immigration enforcement policies have often inhibited the productivity of U.S. companies and made it harder for them to compete in the global marketplace,"" it adds.

On April 18th, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the U.S. v. Texas case which will determine whether Obamas DAPA (Deferred Action for Parents of Americans) and the expansion of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) programs are constitutional and should be allowed to move forward providing deportation relief for approximately 4 million to 5 million undocumented immigrants, according to the Migration Policy Institute.

""Instead of inviting economic contributions of immigrants, our immigration enforcement policies have often inhibited the productivity of U.S. companies and made it harder for them to compete in the global marketplace."" - Supreme Court Brief submitted by 63 U.S. Companies

Obama signed these executive orders on November 20th, 2014. DAPA allows for an estimated 3.6 million undocumented parents with a child who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident to be granted deferred action  or temporary deportation protection. Obama also signed an order expanding the current DACA program  which protects young undocumented immigrants from deportation  to include 275,000 additional immigrants by eliminating the requirement that applicants be younger than 31 years old.

The Supreme Court standoff in April comes 15 months after then-Texas Attorney General, now Gov. Greg Abbot sued the federal government over Obamas measures. The lawsuit was supported by other Republican governors and attorney generals in 24 other states including Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Tennessee. The U.S. district court for the Southern District of Texas and the U.S. Court of Appeals in the Fifth circuit ruled in favor of Abbott, temporarily halting the implementation of the programs.

The brief Tuesday represents a major step by some of the biggest companies and entrepreneurs in tech and other industries to support immigration actions that they believe will the U.S. economy.

Immigrants are responsible for launching 25 percent of the high tech companies founded in the last decade, the brief reads.

The 63 businesses lay out several reasons as to why Obamas executive actions are a positive step forward toward fixing Americas broken immigration system arguing that undocumented immigrants can fill positions in fields where the United States faces major skill gaps.

The brief also argues that agriculture, dairy and food service industries are suffering as a result of immigration enforcement policies that are deporting workers who are vital in these industries.

Absent of deportation relief or temporary work visas, like DAPA and DACA, companies are encouraged to hire undocumented immigrants harming all U.S. workers and law-abiding businesses, according to the brief. Companies who hire undocumented immigrants can refuse to pay them minimum wage or fail to comply with safety standards. These practices drive down wages and create more dangerous working conditions for all U.S. workers. They also expose law-abiding businesses to unfair competition, the brief argues.

The stress of deportation looming over undocumented immigrants and families is a huge detriment to millions of undocumented immigrant children affecting their cognitive and behavioral development.

Obama's executive actions, the brief concludes, ""strengthen the American economy by stabilizing the workforce, promoting job creation, reducing deficits, and increasing federal, state and local tax revenues.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Bill Cosby's wife Camille says she never read his sex assault deposition,[],"The wife of Bill Cosby said she never read a deposition in which her husband acknowledged he gave sedatives to women he was planning to have sex with, according to an excerpt of her testimony in a defamation lawsuit against her husband.

Camille Cosby testified last month in the civil case filed in federal court in Massachusetts by seven women who claim he sexually assaulted them decades ago. The women allege the actor-comedian defamed them when his representatives branded them as liars after they went public with their allegations.

An excerpt of Camille Cosby's deposition was attached to a court filing Monday by Bill Cosby's lawyers seeking to suspend the defamation case while a criminal case is pending against him in Pennsylvania. In that case, Cosby is charged with sexually assaulting former Temple University employee Andrea Constand.

In the Constand case, Cosby acknowledged in a 2005 deposition, made public last year, that he gave quaaludes to at least one woman and unidentified others he wanted to have sex with.

Camille Cosby says in her testimony in February that she and her husband discussed his deposition in the Constand case, but she wouldn't say specifically what they discussed about it. A U.S. District Court judge in Massachusetts had ruled that she could refuse to answer questions that call for testimony prohibited by the Massachusetts marital disqualification rule, which generally prohibits spouses from testifying about private marital conversations.

More on this... Bill Cosby's wife Camille subject of compassion, anger regarding husband's sex abuse scandal

In the February deposition excerpt, Camille Cosby says she learned of Constand's allegations through her husband. The back-and-forth between Camille Cosby's lawyers and a lawyer for the seven women, Joseph Cammarata, became combative when Camille Cosby referred to private conversations she had with her husband.

When Cammarata asked her whether she had a discussion with her husband about the substance of his deposition testimony in the Constand case, Camille Cosby replies: ""That is just communication between my husband and me.""

After her lawyer advises her that she can answer ""yes"" or ""no"" whether she's discussed it without divulging any of what was said, Camille Cosby answers, ""Yes,"" saying she did discuss his deposition testimony with him.

The seven women who brought the defamation lawsuit are among about 50 women who have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct. He has denied their allegations.

Cosby, 78, has pleaded not guilty in the Pennsylvania case, the only criminal case against him.

Through a spokesman, lawyers for Bill and Camille Cosby declined to comment on Camille Cosby's deposition. Cammarata also declined to comment.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Pentagon flew drones over US to aid first responders, official says",[],"The Pentagon was pushing back Wednesday afternoon on a USA Today report about the government's domestic drone program, with defense officials asserting the few non-military missions flown over U.S. territory were done to aid first responders.

A defense official, who had knowledge of drone use inside the U.S. and spoke to Fox News, detailed several missions: Helping first responders extinguish forest fires in California in 2013; assisting in two search-and-rescue missions in California in 2015; helping stop recent flooding in Mississippi and South Carolina.

In those cases, requests were made by organizations such as FEMA, the California Office of Emergency Services and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers



""We felt like we could help,"" said the official, who had

knowledge of the military's drone use inside the U.S. ""We were

supporting first responders.""



But that explanation differed from the description of the drone program in a USA Today report that portrayed the unmanned aerial vehicles as being used to ""spy over U.S. territory.""



USA Today, which first reported in-depth about the flights on Wednesday, cited a Pentagon inspector general report that was recently made public by a Freedom of Information Act request as the source of most of its information.



That report said fewer than 20 such flights had occurred between 2006 and 2015 and all had been lawful.

The document provided no details of any approved mission. One example of a request, however, indicated an unidentified mayor asked the Marine Corps to fly a drone over his city to find potholes. The request was denied because it did not make operational sense.

Under 2006 guidelines established by the Pentagon, military drone use for civilian missions had to be approved by the secretary of defense or someone delegated by the secretary, USA Today reported. No defense secretaries have ever delegated that responsibility, according to the report. In 2015, those rules were altered so that only the secretary of defense could grant approval for missions, and drones could only be flown for testing or training.

Then-FBI Director Robert Mueller first revealed in 2013 testimony before Congress that drones had flown over the U.S.

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Fantasy NASCAR Arizona Good Sam 500(k) driver picks,[],"The NASCAR Sprint Cup Series travels to Avondale, Arizona this week for the Good Sam 500(k). The race can be seen Sunday at 3:30 p.m. ET on FOX. Be sure to test your knowledge of NASCAR by competing in Fox Sports Fantasy Auto Racing.

The weather was the story at Las Vegas Sunday. The day started with high winds and ended with a dust storm. Team Penske proved to have the cars to beat after the weather settled down. Brad Keselowski found his way to Victory Lane with his teammate Joey Logano coming in second place.

There have been two races this season (Atlanta and Las Vegas) using the new lower downforce package. Six drivers have finished both races in the top 10. It is clear that these teams have figured out the new cars and they will be the drivers to beat at Phoenix.

Driver Atlanta Las Vegas Jimmie Johnson 1st 3rd Dale Earnhardt Jr. 2nd 8th Kyle Busch 3rd 4th Kurt Busch 4th 9th Kevin Harvick 6th 7th Brad Keselowski 9th 1st

Phoenix International Speedway was reconfigured and repaved in 2011. Progressive banking was added to the 1-mile oval making it race more like an intermediate track than a short track. Teams either know how to set their cars up for Phoenix or they do not. This is a tough track to gain on if your setup is not good when the car is unloaded from the truck.

Here are the results from the two races at Phoenix in 2015:

2015 CampingWorld.com 500 Results (Spring)

Kevin Harvick Jamie McMurray Ryan Newman Kasey Kahne Kurt Busch

2015 Quicken Loans Race for Heroes 500 (Fall)

Dale Earnhardt Jr. Kevin Harvick Joey Logano Kyle Busch Jimmie Johnson

The best strategy for the Good Sam 500(k) is to select the top drivers who qualify poorly on Friday. Track position is not very important since drivers can take a shortcut through the infield and pass many cars in one lap. The scoring system for Fox Sports Fantasy Auto Racing rewards drivers who improve their position in the race more than the drivers who lead the most laps and finish up front. Fantasy teams will need to earn as many bonus points as possible to finish at the top of their league standings.

Pick to Win

No driver has dominated a track the way Kevin Harvick ($13,900) has at Phoenix. The No. 4 car has won five of the seven races since the track was repaved. Last November Harvick had the car to beat but finished in second place. His price tag in Fox Sports Fantasy Auto Racing will make it difficult to select him this week, but Harvick is your driver if you want a guaranteed top-five finish in the Good Sam 500(k).

Contenders

Jimmie Johnson ($13,000) has been the best driver in 2016 and he has had a lot of success at Phoenix. Johnson has won four races at the track but has not been to Victory Lane since the track has been reconfigured. Johnson won the pole and finished fifth in the November race so it seems as though the No. 48 team has the new track figured out.

Team Penske looked great at Las Vegas and they should run well this week. Joey Logano ($12,300) has the second-best driver rating and second-best average finishing position in the last four races at the track. Brad Keselowski ($12,200) had the third-best driver ranking and the fourth-best average finishing position in that time period. Both drivers would be excellent picks for your fantasy team at Phoenix.

Kyle Busch ($12,700) has never run as well as he is now. Busch has finished the last seven races in the top five. He missed the spring race at Phoenix last year, but finished fourth in the fall race. The No. 18 team should lead the Joe Gibbs Racing cars in Phoenix this week.

Dale Earnhardt Jr. ($11,600) is the defending race winner and should run up front Sunday. Earnhardt has finished five of the last six races at Phoenix in the top eight. He probably will not lead many laps, but Earnhardt will find his way to the top 10 at the end of the race.

Sleeper Picks

Paul Menard ($9,300) always runs well early in the season and Phoenix has been a good track for him. Last year the No. 27 car finished both races in the top 14. Menard should easily finish in the top 15 Sunday.

Austin Dillon ($9,000) is starting to show he can compete with the top drivers in the sport. He finished 11th at Atlanta and fifth at Las Vegas. His stats at Phoenix are not great, but Dillon is your driver if you feel like playing the hot hand this week.

Ryan Blaney ($5,000) does not have much experience at Phoenix, but his car is too fast and he has too much talent to pass up at the minimum price this week. Blaney competed in one Xfinity Series race and three Camping World Truck Series races at the track. He should quickly figure out how to make fast laps in his Sprint Cup Series car this week.

Chase Elliott ($5,000) has run well in all three races this season but he does not have the results to show for it. Elliott is another driver well worth his price this week. Whenever fantasy teams can select a top-10 driver for the minimum price, they have to take it.

Here are my picks for the Good Sam 500 for Fox Sports Fantasy Auto Racing:

Driver 1: Kevin Harvick $13,900

Driver 2: Jimmie Johnson $13,000

Driver 3: Kyle Busch $12,700

Driver 4: Chase Elliott $5,000

Driver 5: Ryan Blaney $5,000

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,US Air Force vet found guilty of trying to join ISIS,[],"A federal jury on Wednesday found an Air Force veteran guilty of trying to join the Islamic State, in one of the first U.S. terror trials involving suspected ISIS ties.

Prosecutors say Tairod Pugh, 48, went to Turkey last year hoping to make his way to Syria to join ISIS.

Defense lawyers say the Neptune, New Jersey man didn't intend to find the terror group a month after he lost his job as an aviation mechanic. But prosecutors say Pugh was preparing to reject the country he had served in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990.

Pugh appeared calm while the verdict was read in the Brooklyn, N.Y. courtroom. He never took the stand during trial testimony.

He faces up to 35 years in prison on the charges of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and obstruction of justice.

Last week, an undercover FBI agent posing as an Islamic State sympathizer testified that he was wearing traditional Muslim religious clothing when he sat down next to Pugh at Kennedy Airport last year, in an area where people waited to be cleared to enter the United States after a trip abroad. He said Pugh told him he had been sent back to the U.S. from Egypt.

""On more than one occasion, he said he expected to be arrested,"" the Los Angeles-based agent said, recalling that Pugh seemed nervous whenever a law enforcement person passed by.

The agent testified that Pugh warmed up to him after seeing an Islamic State flag on his Facebook page. The agent said Pugh told him that if he went to Turkey, he should not look pious.

""He said: 'Shave the beard. Wear the pants.' He said the object is to blend in,"" the agent recalled.

At one point, the agent said, Pugh told him: ""Allah willing, the next time I travel as a tourist to the area, I'll wear a Yankees baseball cap.""

On cross examination, defense lawyer Eric Creizman established that his client never told the agent he had any contact with the Islamic State or any plans to go to Syria. Creizman also had the agent acknowledge that Pugh never said he wanted to wage jihad or become a martyr.

A judge set Pugh's sentencing for September.

The 30-year-old Foster made the Steelers as an undrafted rookie free agent in 2009 before developing into one of the team's most dependable lineman. Foster has made 87 career starts at various positions and has been Pittsburgh's starting right guard for each of the last four seasons.

''Not a bad career so far for an undrafted kid out of Tennessee,'' Foster posted on his Instagram account on Wednesday.

Foster is the fourth player to re-sign with the Steelers rather than test the open market this week. Safety Robert Golden and wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey signed on Monday and cornerback William Gay inked a three-year deal on Tuesday.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Trump evades question over whether hed go to war with Mexico over border wall,[],"Republican front-runner Donald Trump evaded a question from veteran journalist Bob Woodward on Wednesday morning about whether or not he would go to war with Mexico if United States southern neighbor failed to pay for his proposed border wall.

Trust me, Bob, Trump said on a morning talk show. When I rejuvenate our military Mexico is not going to play with us with war.

Trumps comments came after Woodward pressed the billionaire businessman on how he plans to force Mexico to pay for the proposed wall on U.S. southern border.

First of all, Mexico is not going to build it, were going to build it, Trump said. The reason theyre going to pay and the way theyll pay is this: we have a trade deficit now with Mexico of $58 billion a year and the wall is going to cost $10 billion a year.

Trumps comment about the proposed border wall has created a backlash from Mexico and promises from the countrys officials that they will not shell out any money for the wall.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto spoke out earlier this week for the first time against Donald Trump, saying that the Republican front runners rhetoric is damaging the relationship between the United States and Mexico.

I am with those who regret and condemn this kind of [discriminatory] statements by Republican hopeful Donald Trump, they hurt the relationship with the U.S.,"" Pena Nieto told El Universal.

While Pena Nieto added that he is not worried about Trump actually winning the presidential election in November, he did say that his administration will seek the path of mutual respect, constructive dialogue and bridges that allow us to really build a better relationship with whoever gets elected.

Last month, former Mexican President Vicente Fox was not as guarded with his words when speaking about Trump and his proposed border wall.

""Im not going to pay for that f***ing wall! Fox told Jorge Ramos in an interview for Fusion. He should pay for it. Hes got the money.

The comments from Fox echoed those of his successor, Felipe Calderon, a few days before.

Mexican people, we are not going to pay a single cent for such a stupid wall! And it's going to be completely useless, Calderon told CNBC.

Trumps rhetoric might be hurting U.S.-Mexican relations, but it has helped him speed out front in the race for Republican delegates. Following his wins in Mississippi, Michigan and Hawaii on Tuesday, Trump now has 461 delegates compared to Ted Cruzs 359 and Marco Rubios 151.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Chairman McCaul: The terrorist exodus has begun and we're not ready for it,['Michael Mccaul'],"FBI Director James Comey testified before Congress in 2014 that the thousands of Western foreign fighters bound for the Middle East would one day come home as battle-hardened extremists.

There will be a terrorist diaspora out of those areasespecially Syriathat we all wake up every day thinking and worrying about, he warned.

Two years later, the exodus has begun in earnest, and we are woefully unprepared to deal with it.

More than 6,000 Westerners, including Americans, have gone to fight with groups like ISIS in Syria and Iraq, and reportedly around 2,000 of them have returnedsome to plot terrorist attacks and others to set up new extremist networks.

The reality could not be more clear: jihadists are coming home, and they are piggy-backing on the refugee flows to avoid detection.

We saw this in November with the Paris attacks, in January with a suicide bombing in Turkey against Western tourists, and in February when German authorities arrested two terror suspects for allegedly plotting an attack in Berlin.

In each of these cases, terrorists reportedly posed as Syrian refugees fleeing the war-torn country.

One international terrorism think tank has catalogued at least 40 suspected jihadists who have been caught entering Europe posing as migrants or refugees.

Indeed, the attempts are becoming so common that a top American NATO commander testified before Congress last week that terrorists and returning foreign fighters are becoming a daily part of the refugee flow into Europe. If that doesnt set off alarm bells, then I dont know what does.

This year it will only get easier for extremists to blend into the mix. The number of refugees and migrants arriving in Europe in just the past two monthsmore than 100,000has already exceeded the entire first half of last year, according to UN figures.

But we cannot pretend the problem is an ocean away. For us, the danger is a plane-flight away, as extremists are trying to infiltrate U.S. humanitarian programs, too.

Intelligence officials have notified me that possible terror suspects in Syria have already tried to enter our country as refugees.

The concerted effort by ISIS to deploy operativesusing whatever routes possibleshould come as no surprise. The group is dead set on ramping up external operations and has already been linked to 75 terrorist plots against the West, one-third targeting the United States.

ISIS members in their own words have threatened to take advantage of the Syrian refugee crisis to launch attacks, and they are clearly following through on it.

My committee will release a report next month on the issue of terrorist exploitation of refugee flows, marking the conclusion of a year-long review into the threat. The findings are concerning.

For instance, gaping security loopholes are making it easier for violent extremists to slip through the cracksand possibly get closer to our homeland. Nowhere is this clearer than in Europe, where the continents open borders have become a cause celebre for jihadists.

There are no real controls, one diplomat in the region explained to us, adding that authorities take fingerprints, accept whatever identification they provideif they have oneand send them on their way. My Committee found many countries were not checking this information against counterterrorism databases.

This is inexcusable. If foreign governments are not rigorously screening refugees against terrorist watchlists, they will likely be overlooked, putting our allies at risk and allowing extremists to get one step closer to the United States.

We cannot adopt a wait-and-see approach while jihadists ride the wave of refugees into the West. We must act.

That is why this month the House Homeland Security Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee will work to move bills through Congress to accelerate security cooperation with our overseas partnersespecially on disrupting terrorist travel. The legislation would help our allies put better counterterrorism checks in place and focus U.S. assistance on the highest-risk countries.

We also need to strengthen our defenses here at home.

In November, the House voted on a bill I co-authored with Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., the American SAFE Act, to enhance screening of Syrian and Iraqi refugees to weed out terror suspects. The legislation, which passed with a bipartisan veto-proof majority, does not shut the door on refugees; instead, it adds additional layers of security to the process for the highest-risk refugee categories.

Yet the president has pressured Democrats to stall this bill in the Senate. At a time when our enemies are targeting refugee routes to sneak into our country, I am worried that delay could be deadly.

Already this year two ISIS-linked Iraqi refugees were arrested in the United States on terror charges, one of which had reportedly returned from fighting in Syria.

Ultimately, the real security gap we must close is the leadership vacuum on the international stage. Hesitancy and half-measures have allowed Syria to become a jihadist powder keg, and lack of American leadership has encouraged Russia and Iran to fan the flames.

This is a humanitarian catastrophe, to be sure. But if we dont get more assertive in resolving the crisis, it will be remembered for becoming a terrorist Trojan Horse.

The pressure comes amid scores of reports that Christians are being slaughtered, that Christian women are being raped and sold into slavery, and that Christian churches are being demolished.

Less than a year ago, a video surfaced purporting to show 30 Ethiopian Christian men marched onto a beach before being beheaded and shot by the Islamic State, supposedly for refusing to renounce their faith.

But with the administration facing a March 17 deadline to decide how to label the situation, officials have hedged when asked which way they may decide.

Secretary of State John Kerry faced tough questioning on Capitol Hill days ago, when pressed on why the administration hasnt yet called the violence genocide.

It does require a lot of fact-gathering, Kerry said at a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. I mean you have to get the facts from the ground, more than just anecdotal.

Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., countered that the whole world knows that Christians are being slaughtered in the Middle East.

It's clear, he continued, it's time for America to act -- and the excuse that we've got to study it, we've got to ask the lawyers what the wording is ... It's unacceptable.

A new ad, and petition drive, launched by the Knights of Columbus and In Defense of Christians is putting additional pressure on the administration, citing statements from presidential candidates of both parties calling whats happening genocide.

With the U.S. Commission on International [Religious] Freedom having stating this, with 200-plus bipartisan sponsors [of a House resolution] having stated this, with the major presidential candidates of both parties having stated this, the question is, does the State Department want to stand alone as a genocide denier? Andrew Walther, a vice president with the Knights of Columbus, told Fox News.

He said the U.S. has a checkered past in terms of labeling mass killings as genocide, and said there's a real opportunity here to get it right.

This letter went online on Feb. 22.

Problem is, the equation isn't exactly new. It's widely known in the climate science community as the Kaya identity, and was reviewed in the scientific literature in 2002 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

But instead of grilling Gates about the origins of the formula, climate scientists are glad he's talking about it, said Michael Mann, a distinguished professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University. [The Reality of Climate Change: 10 Myths Busted]

""My guess is that he had seen this somewhere in the past, and sort of forgot where it came from,"" Mann said. ""And thought that maybe he had come up with it. I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.""

The genesis of Gates' equation might remain a mystery for now  the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation didn't return Live Science's requests for comment. But no matter where the equation came from, it can help scientists keep tabs on carbon dioxide emissions, Mann said.

The Kaya identity explains the factors involved in carbon dioxide output, but it's not a ""magical formula,"" Mann said. ""It's a way of breaking our carbon emissions into a number of factors, each of which we can try to focus on separately.""

However, none of the factors is independent of the others, and so cannot be viewed in isolation, Mann said.

Rubio said he doesn't want to be cast either as an establishment figure or an outsider incapable of getting anything done. ""I've only been in the Senate for five years, and I've kept my promises to fight hard against the status quo, and that's why I'm running for president,"" he said.

And he is projecting confidence hopscotching from Puerto Rico to Idaho and back to Florida after a string of defeats from Super Tuesday through Saturday. ""We're going to win Florida,"" he promises, ahead of a ""long slog"" for delegates thereafter.

Still, his conundrum is on full display.

In Wichita, Kansas, he declared: ""Every traditional institution in America is failing you."" He named ""the media ... higher education ... big business ... and, by the way ... your politicians and your political parties.""

Rubio tells the story of his 2010 Senate bid, when he ""took on"" the ""Washington establishment"" by running against prohibitive favorite and then-Gov. Charlie Crist in the GOP primary.

Yet the senator also touts his 15 years in government  what he pitches as ""taking conservative principles and turning them into conservative action"". Even more noteworthy, he embraces elected officials at one campaign rally after another.

In Idaho, which hosts its primary Tuesday, Sen. James Risch praised his colleague's effectiveness and support for the Idaho National Laboratory, a federal energy research installation.

In Kansas, Gov. Sam Brownback, Sen. Pat Roberts and Rep. Mike Pompeo took the stage. Brownback  who has abysmal approval ratings amid sweeping state budget cuts  drew boos in Kansas City when called upon to introduce his guest. A day later, Rubio garnered 17 percent in the Kansas caucus, another third-place finish behind Cruz and Trump.

Rubio has campaigned with South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal. He lost both their states, registering just 11 percent on Jindal's home turf.

In Puerto Rico, the senator held forth in English and Spanish on the island territory's debt crisis and stagnant economy. ""Your government spends more money than it takes in,"" while high taxes and regulations ""make it harder to do business,"" he said. He did so surrounded by Puerto Rican power players.

Though he affirms the anti-establishment fervor, Rubio also takes shots at Trump and what the GOP leader calls a ""movement"" of the ""silent majority.""

""Don't give into the fear,"" Rubio told supporters Sunday in Idaho Falls, Idaho. ""Do not allow the conservative movement to be defined as anger.""

In Kansas, he offered a more ominous warning. ""Every movement in human history that has been built on a foundation of anger and fear,"" he said, ""has been cataclysmic in the end.""

In his most explicit moments, Rubio declares Trump's nomination ""would shatter the party and the conservative movement."" Of course, he later told reporters in Kansas that he would support Trump if he is the nominee.

Some of Rubio's supporters explain the apparent tightrope.

Mike Moody, a 68-year-old veterinarian in Eureka, Kansas, called Trump ""unstable"" and not ""trustworthy,"" adding that his supporters are ""idiots if they think Mexico is going to pay for that wall"" at the U.S-Mexico border.

But, Moody says, ""I'm going to vote Republican in November no matter what.""

For his part, Rubio rejects any notion that his approach is haphazard or perhaps contradictory, instead framing it as the only way to ""unite this party"" and, ultimately, the country.

""I will seek to be the president for all Americans, even those who don't vote for me,"" Rubio said.

But, for now, he clearly needs more of them to do just that.

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Intriguing Inanda: A Historic Mansion in New York Is Listed for $3M,[],"Irvington, NY, is known for its efforts to preserve 19th-century architectural gems that reflect how the wealthy lived during the height of America's Gilded Age. Now one of those gems is on the market for $2.95, million and it's only a 30-minute commute from midtown Manhattan.

This eight-bedroom home was built by Cyrus West Field, a man once famous for laying the first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable. Field built the 8,000-square-foot home in 1875 for one of his daughters and her husband, who was from South Africa. The entrepreneur named the mansion Inanda, which means ""pleasant place"" in Zulu.

""To this day it holds a unique place in the area,"" says Bernadette Haley, who along with partners Elizabeth Beth Hargraves and Maria Carlino, is listing the home. Field once owned 800 acres in Irvington, and the area consisting of his former land holdings is now known as Ardsley Park.

""It's a very prestigious community and a very special place,"" Haley says.

The sellers have been in the home -- which sits on 2.34-acres and offers views of the Hudson River -- for 14 years.

""They appreciated the historic value of the home and also appreciated having today's amenities, so they made extensive repairs and updates,"" Haley explains.

The sellers spent six weeks stripping paint from the wood walls and trim in the entry hallway to restore them to their former grandeur. They commissioned new sconces in the classic Tiffany style to pay homage to the original Tiffany tiles in a bathroom as well as original Tiffany windows in the dining room, Haley explains.

The master bathroom has been modernized, while the kitchen reflects the sellers' love of cooking and entertaining, Hargraves explains. The kitchen features a commercial dishwasher and walk-in refrigerator, among other amenities. The sellers once hosted 72 guests for Thanksgiving, cooking four large turkeys simultaneously in the large kitchen.

Other creature comforts were also updated. Central air conditioning was added, and two heating zones were created for efficiency and comfort. Original windows were updated with brass chains to ensure they open and close properly. Two central vacuum systems were installed.

The home features both wood- and coal-burning fireplaces. Over the years, copper gutters and an in-ground swimming pool were added. An elevator shaft also exists in the home. Though not currently functioning, it could be fitted with an elevator should a new owner want one.

Walk into the home and ""you feel like you're in a piece of history. It's just beautiful and grand,"" says Hargraves.

""Yet warm and grand,"" adds Haley. It's just the place for new owners to create family memories of their own that will rival any from the Gilded Age.",[]

Team president Joe Garone made NASCAR aware of the team's decision after meeting with NASCAR officials in an effort to seek clarity on the reasoning behind the P3 penalty.

NASCAR announced last Wednesday that Pearn would be suspended for one race and fined $50,000, and that Truex and the team would be stripped of 15 driver and owner points, respectively, for a roof-flap violation discovered in pre-race inspection at Atlanta Motor Speedway. It was the team's second roof-flap violation in as many weeks after an issue during qualifying for the Daytona 500 resulted in Pearn being placed on probation through the end of the year.



After being allowed to work last weekend's race in Las Vegas while the appeal was pending, Pearn will be replaced atop the No. 78 pit box this weekend at Phoenix International Raceway by former Furniture Row crew chief and garage area veteran Todd Berrier, who is now the director of fabrication at Joe Gibbs Racing.

""Being able to secure the services of Todd for Phoenix was an incredible and selfless gesture by Joe Gibbs Racing,"" said Garone in a team release. ""We are very proud to have a technical alliance with Joe Gibbs Racing and are deeply grateful for its quick response to offer assistance. I also want to thank Todd. He has plenty on his plate and to go the extra mile to help us out is appreciated by everyone at Furniture Row Racing.""

Berrier was the crew chief for the single-car team from Denver, Colorado from July 2012 through the 2014 season while Pearn was the team's lead race engineer. Berrier and Pearn also worked together at Richard Childress Racing and JTG Daugherty Racing.

""I don't see this being anymore than a seamless transition of Todd taking over the crew chief role for one race,"" said Garone. ""Todd knows our system very well. He has worked with Martin, Cole, the majority of our crew and Toyota.""",[]

Onward, reality show junkies",['Edward Rollins'],"Donald Trump has absorbed more attacks in the last two weeks from his opponents, their super PACs and the Republican establishment than any candidate I've seen in my five decades around presidential politics.

The ""shock and awe"" attack of unfriendly fire seems to have had minimum impact on his candidacy as he won two big victories Tuesday night in Mississippi and Michigan. Big Don is still standing and the establishment favorite, little Marco got routed -- finishing out of money in both contests.

Ted Cruz, who came in second in both races in Michigan and Mississippi and won Idaho, keeps fighting to remain relevant. He is having a tough time reaching beyond the evangelical base which he splits with Trump. But the finals of this election cycle could come down to Trump versus Cruz.

John Kasich came in a distant second to Trump in his neighboring state which may bode poorly for his showdown next week in Ohio, the state he governs.

Rubio is on death watch and life support and can't survive if he doesn't win his home state of Florida. Tuesday night's poor showing is not going to encourage the money guys to bet more on him and he faces a real uphill battle to beat Trump in the billionaires adopted state of Florida.

Trumps battle cry ""I love Florida and they love me!"" will be tested in seven days in the first of the winner take all states. There will be no more second place finishes or silver medals. Win or lose is now the rule of the game.

We have now seen the travelogue of the Trump properties and golf courses, suffered through a full display of all his products from vodka to steaks and the men's accessories made in China.

Tuesdays nights Trump victory speech/press conference was like a lengthy sales pitch on Home Shopping Network.

I've never before seen a press conference in which the press is hollering ""Stop, please stop! No mas, no mas!"" No more questions, please!!

Donald's hour long tirade and rambling speech was his revenge for the assault on him by the billionaires and their political consultants who have puffed and puffed but can't blow Donald's house down.

Onward, reality show junkies. This show is a long way from being over!

Maybe the only thing that can slow the Donald down is ""House of Cards"" Frank Underwood. Of course his presidency is in trouble, too. But this reality show is stranger than fiction!

Theres a debate coming Thursday, America! And another big week coming...

Lt. Col. Damien Pickart, a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force, told Reuters Wednesday the deployments could include B-1 bombers and an expansion of B-52 bomber missions. However, Pickart noted that talks between the two countries were preliminary.

""These bomber rotations provide opportunities for our airmen to advance and strengthen our regional alliances and provide (Pacific Air Forces) and U.S. Pacific Command leaders with a credible global strike and deterrence capability to help maintain peace and security in the Indo-Asia-Pacific region,"" Pickart told Reuters.

Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull declined to comment on the matter when approached by reporters.

""I can just assure you that everything we do in this area is very carefully determined to ensure that our respective military forces work together as closely as possible in our mutual national interests,"" he said.

Should the U.S. and Australia reach an agreement, it is sure to add more pressure on China.

""Cooperation among relevant counties should protect regional peace and stability, and not target the interests of third parties,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in a briefing.

Washington sent an aircraft carrier and five escort ships to the South China Sea last week. The dispatch sent a signal to China that the U.S. Navy will continue to conduct freedom of navigation patrols even as China continues to militarize the artificial reefs, defense officials told Fox News.

The possibility of the U.S. stationing B-1 bombers in Australia was broached last year, but Australias Defense Minister said they had misspoken.

The U.S. conducts B-52 missions from Australia periodically, but doesnt fly any B-1s from there.

Opposition politicians on Tuesday demanded Venezuela's government do more to determine what happened to a group of missing miners allegedly killed by gang members.

More than 1,000 soldiers fanned out across the southeastern jungle state of Bolivar to search for the 28 miners who relatives say were dismembered and disappeared by a gang seeking to take over a disputed gold claim.

The country's opposition-controlled Congress planned to discuss later Tuesday whether state agents might have been involved in the disappearances.

Families and people who said they witnessed the attack accused law enforcement agents of participating. Lawmaker Americo de Grazia said that given the number of missing miners, the reported atrocity could have taken place only with the complicity of local officials.

Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez denied these claims.

""We know very well who is behind these accusations, and we won't fall for the provocations of the old political establishment,"" he said. ""We won't rest until we know everything about incident, which is abhorrent to all Venezuelans.""

Bolivar state Gov. Francisco Rangel, a staunch ally of Venezuela's governing socialist administration, has said there is still no proof a massacre occurred.

Local media quoted people involved with the case as saying they feared for their safety, pointing to the military taking control of their small town and voicing concerns that gang members might be seeking to quiet them.

The public prosecutor's office is investigating, and has taken protective measures for two miners' relatives.

TEHRAN, Iran  Iran reportedly test-fired two ballistic missiles Wednesday with the phrase ""Israel must be wiped out"" written in Hebrew on them, a show of force by the Islamic Republic as U.S. Vice President Joe Biden visited Israel.

Such phrases have been emblazoned on missiles fired before by Iran, but this test comes as the country recently signed a nuclear deal with world powers, including America, and conducted another test the day before. Hard-liners in Iran's military have fired rockets and missiles despite U.S. objections since the deal, as well as shown underground missile bases on state television.

There was no immediate reaction from Jerusalem, where Biden was scheduled to speak to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who strongly opposed the nuclear deal.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Jeff Bezos company planning human test space flights by 2017,[],"KENT, Wash.  Private space travel company Blue Origin expects its first test flights with people in 2017, company founder Jeff Bezos said during a tour of the venture's research and development site outside Seattle.

And Bezos said Tuesday that thousands of people have expressed interest in eventually paying for a trip on a suborbital craft.

For now, the man who founded Amazon.com is spending some of the billions earned from the Seattle-based online retailer on high tech equipment and about 600 employees working in a former Boeing airplane parts facility. Bezos said he's convinced the company  a vision of his childhood dreams, will eventually be profitable.

The company isn't taking deposits yet, so it's unclear whether thousands of interested space travelers will translate into sales.

Blue Origin, founded in 2000, has launched a ship twice, and it landed safely. The company plans to keep testing until its usefulness is done then switch to other ships being built to test human flight.

The real money will be made selling rocket engines to others planning to launch satellites and spaceships, Bezos said. United Launch Alliance has asked Blue Origin to build the engine for its new launch vehicle so it can stop relying on Russian-made engines.

Bezos, who still has his day job at Amazon, said he's deeply involved at Blue Origin and spends time in the Kent facility, about 17 miles south of Seattle. He enthusiastically shared technical details and explanations during a media tour and one engineer said he was as knowledgeable about the technology as anyone in the building.

""I only pursue things that I am passionate about,"" Bezos said. He spoke of dreaming of space travel and building rockets since he was 5.

He said he wasn't ready to share exactly how much he has invested in the space venture, saying just that all the high tech equipment and about 600 employees have added up to ""a very significant number.""

The media-shy company said welcoming the press to their development floor was a first step toward more openness, but all but a few photographs of the facility were prohibited.

Bezos said he wasn't concerned about his competition to build the next generation of rocket engines because society will need lots of help moving industry and people off the planet.

A handful of other U.S. companies are currently competing in the private space business, including SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, which are also at the testing stage.

Bezos doesn't care about being the first private company to offer space tourism to the masses. The real goal is to perfect their equipment by flying as many as 100 suborbital flights a year. Bezos said safety is the No. 1 goal.

The company also wants to eventually decrease the cost of space launches by enough to put projects like building a colony on Mars within reach. The key is making spaceships reusable, which is Blue Origin's goal, Bezos said.

""What I know you cannot afford is throwing the hardware away,"" he said.

Blue Origin has not yet revealed on how much its space tourism tickets will cost.",[]

Theyre not curing it, so were not winning, but they are prolonging and decreasing some of the pain and suffering. One is what we call personalized medicine or molecularly targeted therapy.

Mitt Romney derides Trump voters as suckers. Others have sneered that Trump has an army of low information voters who have been duped, and that these people shouldnt be able to decide on the fate of a Grand Old Party. Trumps voters, the political class screams, have hijacked the Republican Party.

Another conservative commentator complained the other day that many of these voters have never even voted before and they are not even Republicans. Huh?

Isnt it a good thing that Trump is steering millions of new voters away from the Democrats and attracting them to the GOP? I thought we were told Republicans lost in 2012 because so many conservatives stayed home. Here they are.

The GOPs mighty establishment wing  the people who get rich off the game of politics -- pretend that theirs is the party of the working class, of blue collar virtue, and hard work, but now that the workers they supposedly represent are in revolt, apparently the problem is the voters not the party. This is insanity.

This is like the executives at Coca Cola blaming the stupid public for not liking New Coke. What kind of a company blames its customers when things go wrong? Inside Washington, there are no term limits on stupidity.

Former House Republican majority leader Tom DeLay advised on Fox this past Friday that Republicans should do all they can to stop Trump from getting a majority (though he will likely have a plurality) and then at the convention, throw Trump and his troublemaking voters under the bus and pick someone who got millions of fewer votes than Trump did. Delays point is that the party and its delegates, not the voters, should choose who the nominee is. He seemed to be saying: its our club and we make the rules. (Funny, Republicans just a few weeks ago were guffawing that Democrats had rigged their primary process.)

The rules of the party apparently say that Delay is right. So the master plan is to let the elites decide whats best for us.

Gee. I thought thats what liberals do!

Im no Trump enthusiast by any means  and I agree with some of what he says and believe that he is flat out wrong about the benefits of trade and immigration  which are substantial. Trump is often offensive and unpredictable.

But the Trump haters ought to get out and attend a Trump rally.

You will meet truck drivers, and soccer moms, and veterans, and taxicab drivers, and immigrants, and construction workers, and young people, and not a lot of Wall Streeters or political consultants. They are patriotic. They are seething in anger at both parties.

We've had eight years of a mostly failed Republican president followed by eight years of a failed Democrat in the White House.

Over this whole period many of these voters haven't seen a pay increase and many have seen their incomes fall -- while GOP political consultants rake in millions for losing.

The fact that four of the wealthiest counties in America are inside or near the Washington Beltway says everything voters need to know about how they are being bled dry by government.

Whenever I say anything nice about Trump I get scowls and lectures from my conservative friends in Washington that Trump voters dont believe in the principles of the Republican Party.

Wait. The Republicans in Congress just passed a budget that spends tens of billions more than when Democrats ran Congress. The GOP budget increases the deficit. I thought that key principles of the GOP were less government, balanced budgets and fiscal responsibility.

The Republicans have only themselves to blame for this working class revolt. These are voters who are horrified by what Obama has done to our country and they put their faith in Republicans to fix things  and they didnt. Worse, they havent even try.



And now the Republican brain trust is hatching a plan to effectively disenfranchise the Trump voters altogether. I hope Im wrong, but when the GOP loses again with this strategy, and Hillary Clinton is being sworn into office, the party leaders will scratch their heads and ask: Gee, where did all those Trump voters go?

Highway Patrol officials told the Kansas City Star that Pablo Antonio Serrano-Vitorino was arrested in Montgomery County, Missouri. He was found lying on a hill just north of Interstate-70 and no shots were fired, according to The Star.

""He looked exhausted,"" Sgt. James Hedrick said.

The suspect had a rifle with him, but federal law barred him from legally owning a gun because he is in the country illegally, according to John Ham, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives office in Kansas City.

Online court records show he was charged Wednesday in Montgomery County, Missouri, in the death of 49-year-old Randy Nordman. Nordman was shot Tuesday at his rural home near New Florence, about 70 miles west of St. Louis.

Serrano-Vitorino is also charged with four counts of first-degree murder in Kansas. Authorities there say he gunned down a neighbor and three other men late Monday before fleeing. Investigators haven't discussed a possible motive for the attacks.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said in a statement late Tuesday that Serrano-Vitorino was a Mexican national who was held at the Overland Park, Kan. Municipal Court on Sept. 14. The fingerprinting generated an ICE detainer, but the agency was erroneously issued...to the Johnson County Sheriffs Office, instead of the Overland Park Municipal Court.

The Department of Homeland Security said that Serrano-Vitorino was released from custody without ICE being notified, though they did not elaborate on why. ICE also confirmed that Serrano-Vitorino had been deported back to Mexico in 2004, but had since returned illegally.

It was not clear when he returned to the U.S.

The widespread manhunt for him, which started Monday, included helicopters, police dogs and at least one SWAT team. One of the four men shot that day managed to call police before he died, but it's unclear how the men knew each other or what may have prompted the shooting, Kansas City police officer Thomas Tomasic said.

A truck Serrano-Vitorino was believed to be driving was found about 7 a.m. Tuesday morning alongside Interstate-70 in central Missouri.

About 25 minutes later, sheriff's deputies responded to a shooting about 5 miles away at a Montgomery County home and found the body of 49-year-old Nordman, according to the patrol.

Highway Patrol Lt. Paul Reinsch said a witness who called 911 reported seeing a man running from Nordman's property, launching a manhunt of that area.

Reinsch said investigators weren't aware of any connection between Serrano-Vitorino and Nordman, whose home is near his family's campground and a racetrack for remote-controlled cars.

Police have not released the names of the four victims, but relatives identified three of them to the Kansas City Star as Mike Capps and brothers Clint and Austin Harter.

Patrice Bergeron scored twice for the Bruins. Brett Connolly and David Pastrnak also had goals, Brad Marchand had two assists and Tuukka Rask made 47 saves.

Jiri Hudler scored twice for the Panthers. Jussi Jokinen also scored and Jonathan Huberdeau had two assists. Roberto Luongo allowed four goals on 16 shots before being replaced by Al Montoya to start the second period. Montoya stopped 15 shots.

The Panthers lost their third straight game. The Bruins are 5-1-1 in their last seven.

On his winner, Stempniak took a pass from Ryan Spooner high in the right circle and fired the puck over Montoya with 1:00 left in the extra period.

""I tried selling to the far side and get him leaning a little bit and then go to the short side. It was a great pass from Spooner,"" Stempniak said.

The Panthers 51 shots are a season high, and they were able to salvage a point after being behind 3-0 and 4-1 in the first period.

The Panthers maintain second place in the Atlantic Division. They are tied in points with the Bruins but have a game in hand.

Behind 4-3, the Panthers tied it 4-all on Hudler's second goal. Hudler grabbed a rebound in the slot and poked the puck past Rask with 4:43 left in the third.

""It felt great, but we were bad the first period and we battled back. I thought we played real well the second and third,"" Hudler said.

The Bruins scored four goals in the first period and seemed to be cruising to an easy win.

Bergeron's first goal gave the Bruins a 1-0 lead just 34 seconds in. Bergeron skated in on Luongo and beat him on the glove side for his 27th of the season. Bergeron has scored a goal in four straight games.

The Bruins went ahead 2-0 when Pastrnak backhanded the puck between Luongo's pads at 7:00.

The Panthers finally got on the board when Barkov grabbed a rebound in the slot and slid it under Rask's pads with 3:12 left in the first.

The celebration was short-lived. Bergeron's shot from the right circle beat Luongo 37 seconds later for his second goal to make it 4-1.

foxnews.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,"Private schools start popping in Cuba, inequality enters the equation",[],"Cuba touts its free, public kindergarten-to-post-grad schools as one of the jewels of its revolution, a force for social equality that virtually wiped out illiteracy across the island and gave even the poorest citizens a shot at educations often superior to wealthier countries'.

""This is a conversation between two children,"" Graciela Lage Delgado tells a rapt class of third-graders, tightly enunciating each English word from a textbook called ""Welcome to America.""

""Is it a TV?"" Lage asks in a girl's voice, pointing to an illustration of a boxy silver robot.

""No, it's not!"" the kids shout back in English. ""It's a robot!""

The kids in Lage's class wear sweat shirts and jeans, not the neat maroon uniforms of Cuba's public schools. Their classroom has an air conditioner and a computer with speakers for watching videos, unimaginable in a state school. And unlike most Cubans their age, the children can hold simple conversations in English, thanks to fast-moving, profound change in an important pillar of Cuba's six-decade-old socialist system.

Cuba touts its free, public kindergarten-to-post-grad schools as one of the jewels of its revolution, a force for social equality that virtually wiped out illiteracy across the island and gave even the poorest citizens a shot at educations often superior to wealthier countries'. As the government has allowed an explosion of private businesses ranging from restaurants to car washes, the school system, like health care, has remained under state control. Private schools remain illegal except for children of diplomats and foreign business people. Even the Catholic Church cannot open parochial schools.

Yet against the odds, Cuba's blooming entrepreneurial system has quietly created something that looks much like a private education sector, with thousands of students across Cuba enrolled in dozens of afterschool and weekend foreign language and art schools. The schools are entirely legal because they function as cooperatives of licensed private language teachers, one of the hundreds of new categories of self-employment authorized under Cuba's economic reforms.

For upper- and middle-class parents, the schools are filling gaps in subjects such as English, dance, painting, music and theater  invaluable in a country where artists and tourism industry workers can feed their families far more easily than the average state employee. English is also vital for Cubans migrating to the United States, their numbers nearly doubled since the two countries declared detente in late 2014.

The economic reforms of the last five years have created a large class of private entrepreneurs with lifestyles most Cubans can only dream of. That class has been flooded with cash from a 17 percent surge in the number of tourist visits and a wave of private investment from Cuban emigres launched after detente was announced.

The special schools mean the children of the privileged are increasingly getting a leg up, threatening to root inequality deeper and more broadly in a society where it isn't supposed to exist at all.

""It's just splintering the collective identity, stratifying society more and making the gap between the haves and have-nots great,"" said educational anthropologist Denise F. Blum, author of a 2011 study of Cuban education titled ""Cuban Youth and Revolutionary Values: Educating the New Socialist Citizen.""

""I think it's changing what socialism means for Cuba,"" Blum said.

President Barack Obama travels to Cuba this month to push for such changes  a loosening of state control that allows a middle class to develop independently from the single-party government and the centrally planned economy it controls.

""The diversification of the economy is ultimately a source of a change for the Cuban people because they have more control over their own lives,"" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes, one of the architects of Obama's new policy, told The Associated Press.

Parents with the means are spending about 250 Cuban pesos ($10) a month, around half the average state worker's salary, to give their children early advantages in English and the arts. Math and science are also taught privately, in less formal settings that more closely resemble group private tutoring.

""It's a sacrifice for every Cuban but we try to do it for them, for their future, so that they can get ahead in life,"" said Doralkis Vinas, a homemaker whose husband works in a private automobile body shop.

Their son Julito takes English at the Cuban School of Foreign Languages, which opened five years ago and now has four branches in Havana and two opening in western Pinar del Rio province.

The network, known by its Spanish acronym ECLEX, has hired a staff of moonlighting or retired public school teachers like Lage, who retired from the University of Havana last year after 37 years teaching English.

The project has about 800 students across Cuba, said Yureibys Perez Blanco, the school's director-general, making it among the biggest of about 30 private English institutions in Havana. Besides elementary English, it is starting to offer specialized courses for law, accounting, management, medical English and tourism, she said.

She said there's a need for better English instruction for children in public schools, where there often aren't enough qualified teachers to give weekly English classes. To help, each of the ECLEX branches adopts a needy school nearby and sends a teacher there to teach the weekly English lesson to the class that needs it most.

""We don't have divisions in social classes here but we know that people have different purchasing power,"" she said. ""We have students here whose parents have families overseas that help them financially a lot. We have students whose parents live off their government salaries and save 250 pesos for English school so their kids can be better prepared.""

Private education has also transformed arts education. The country's elite government arts schools have three sets of competitive entrance exams: for elementary school, high-school and the prestigious Superior Institute of Arts university. Cuba prides itself on its achievements in the arts and its musicians, dancers, actors and fine artists have long been allowed to perform and sell their works outside the country. Many have become wealthy by Cuban standards, making an arts career a path to prestige and profit on the island.

""In our workshops, we realize that 95 percent of families come here with the idea that artists are famous, artists travel outside the country,"" said Angel Escobedo, head of a private Havana arts workshop called Entreartes. He said he has about 40 students aged 3 to 21 taking classes in dance, theater, music and fine arts like sculpture.

""They want to prepare themselves for the art schools with the objective of being famous, traveling,"" he said. ""We're the specialists in preparing themselves for the entrance exams.""

Relatively affluent Cubans say preparing their children for career success is just part of the reason they're sacrificing to pay for private education. Many say it's just as important to raise well-rounded children in a society that has long valued arts and language skills as the measures of an educated person.

""The singing teacher says she's the finest student he has,"" said Ireinaldo Hernandez, an airport catering services worker who sends his 9-year-old daughter Erika to Entreartes. ""The dance professor says she's the one with the most flexibility. The sculpture teacher says she's coming along well. Until now we haven't been able to define the path for her to follow so she's in everything. Besides helping us decide, it's all preparation for her life, for her future.""

foxnews.com,2016-02-28 00:00:00,Why we won: Lessons from the Gulf War 25 years later,"[""Mary Ellen O'connell""]","Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, Syria, Yemenall places where the United States has been fighting and losing.

Compare the U.S. record in those places with the liberation of Kuwait in 1991. After one hundred hours of combat, Iraqs large and entrenched military was defeated and pushed back behind a security zone. Twenty-five years later Kuwait remains a free and independent country.

The United States only real failure respecting the Gulf War has been misreading its lessons, a failure that has played a role in the long string of military reversals ever since.

Two false lessons stand out: hawks believe it was a mistake to liberate Kuwait and return home. They advocated continuing to Baghdad to depose Saddam Hussein from power. Similarly, certain NGOs saw the might of the coalition as the right tool for promoting human rights, including by removing dictators.

These lessons overlooked essential aspects of the Gulf victory. It was built fundamentally on strict adherence to international law, and, in 1991, Americas political and military leaders included combat veterans with no illusions about what war could and could not accomplish. Going all the way to Baghdad would have violated the very United Nations Charter rules that had unified the world in a mission to end aggression.

We now know from social science research of the past two and half decades that outside military intervention to impose governments doesnt work. This fact is related to the reality that such interventions are unlawful. When lives are shattered and the environment destroyed for illegitimate ends, the morale of invading troops and the anger of the victims factor in the outcome. In the Gulf War, Saddam Hussein was the one violating fundamental principle. In Americas wars since the Gulf, it has been U.S. presidents.

The most important rule of the United Nations Charter is the prohibition on the use of force. Saddam Hussein violated that rule in one of the most blatant acts of aggression since the Charter was drafted in 1945.

Kuwait had the right to exercise self-defense but was quickly overrun and went to the Security Council to request assistance. The Council acted unanimously and effectively. The U.S. ambassador, Thomas Pickering, was masterfuldemonstrating the value of an experienced diplomatic corps, committed to international law.

The Security Council ordered worldwide sanctions against Iraq. After five months when those failed to persuade, the Council authorized force to liberate Kuwait. 34 nations joined the fight. Others contributed financially. The United States incurred no deficit.

In addition to the Charter, the United States military fought consistently with the Geneva Conventions. Our forces had benefited from the rule of law program instituted after Vietnam. Americas Vietnam debacle has been correctly linked to the illegitimate ends of imposing a regime there and in the way U.S. troops and the CIA fought. Widespread atrocities, of which the My Lai massacre was only one, drove reforms, which paid off in the Gulf as educated, disciplined troops handled 15,000 Iraqi prisoners of war in exemplary fashion.

I know all of this first hand as the wife of Americas most forward deployed interrogator in Operation Desert Storm. He was the Geneva Conventions trainer for the Third Armor Division. He was incredulous when Maryland National Guard troops -- who abused prisoners in Iraqs Abu Ghraib prison after the 2003 invasion -- said they had had no Geneva Conventions training. That was not the profile of the fighting men and women of the Gulf War victory. They knew they were fighting to end unlawful aggression. They knew how to fight and how to interrogate lawfully, morally, and effectively.

In Washington, President George H. W. Bush, a combat veteran of the Second World War, Secretary Colin Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and veteran of Vietnam, and National Security Adviser, Brent Scowcroft, a West Point graduate and long-serving officer, all understood what military force could accomplish. It is a poor tool for re-shaping societies, changing leaders and imposing systems of government. Those choices must be made by the governed. Pushing one major military across an international boundary with a superior force is what a military can do and succeed.

The knowledge that a soldier is fighting on the side of right and fighting in a way that complies with the rules is empowering. Fighting unlawfully and in violation of the rules weakens morale, costs allies, and angers victims.

At Scowcrofts West Point graduation, Dwight Eisenhower said, War is mankinds most tragic and stupid folly; to seek or advise its deliberate provocation is a black crime against all men.

Provoking war and the unlawful use of military force have cost the U.S. dearly. Part of the high cost has been in terms of standing, influence, and the ability to uphold the prohibition on aggression.

Russia is violating the U.N. Charter in Ukraine but those rules are viewed as weak today. The U.S. faces a dangerous situation in the South and East China Seas but is hardly in a position to demand that China settle its disputes peacefully.

And yet it can. The Gulf War teaches that regardless of past mistakes, the United States can succeed by complying with the law going forward.

President Bush declared at the end of the 100-hour war that we would see a new world order under the rule of law. The time to see that new order is now.

Anniversaries are when we look back and see history in the light of experience. Recent hard experience counsels internalizing the real lessons of a unique victory.

Doug Smith, the owner of WillSpy Private Investigation and Security Services, eventually returned to Central America after being deported to the U.S. He said he never faced charges in the 2013 case. Costa Rican newspapers at the time, citing immigration officials, widely reported that he was charged with immigration fraud.

But Smith disputes the charges. A spokesman for the Costa Rican immigration authority and officials from the countrys prosecutors office did not return repeated calls and emails over several days seeking comment.

Smith was eventually deported because he had failed to renew his 90-day tourist visa. But he claims the government meddled with his immigration paperwork to make it seem like he was breaking the law. And, he claims, someone broke into his home to steal his passport, marriage license and cash to make it seem like he had no official documents.

Im a gringo in a foreign country with no documents and no money, Smith told Fox News Latino.

Stories by the Costa Rican media two years ago said Smith was arrested after a former client accused him of fraud.

It was a simple prescription: land overhand shots, test the chin, and if he had the chance, exploit Nate Dia's ""overrated"" jiu-jitsu before breaking him down piece by piece on the mat.

...Welp...

Quite to the contrary, virtually every asset McGregor believed he had coming into his UFC 196 was turned around and employed against him to devastating effect.

In fact, McGregor described his downfall to Diaz during an interview with UFC reporter Megan Olivi days before stepping into the ring against Diaz. Move by move, McGregor explained each tactic that would fail him, and essentially narrated the exact manner in which he'd be broken down and submitted by his opponent.

McGregor's plan, as he initially laid them out:

""I feel the heel will be a dangerous weapon. The front of the foot, the shin...the uppercuts...the overhands...the body...I will butcher his soft frame. I also would like to dominate him on the mat. I think his jiu-jitsu is overrated. I think he has no positional dominance...no positional understanding at all...he will abandon position and end up on his back or end up in a scramble. So I feel like if he is still conscious when he hits the deck, I will crush his hips, pass his guard and mount him. And then either pound him out or choke.""

Let's parse this:

""I feel the heel will be a dangerous weapon.""

""The overhands.""

""I will crush his hips, pass his guard and mount him. And then either pound him out or choke.""

Yeah, that didn't exactly pan out. You can see a perfect, video-to-interview narration of McGregor's ironic statements here.

Well, for most of Sunday night.

Jori Lehtera scored in his return to the lineup and St. Louis held on to beat the Minnesota Wild 4-2. Ryan Reaves, Patrik Berglund and Robby Fabbri also scored for St. Louis, which won its third straight. The Blues have victories in seven of their past eight road games.

St. Louis led 3-0 before two late goals by Minnesota made things interesting.

""We played a textbook game for us for 52 or 53 minutes,"" said David Backes, who had an assist. ""We could have stuck to our principles for another seven, eight minutes and had a phenomenal game. Instead, we had a good game, found two points and we'll move on.""

St. Louis, playing its first game since an 11-round shootout win Tuesday in Ottawa, remained two points back of Chicago and Dallas in the Central Division. The Blackhawks beat Detroit 4-1 and the Stars won 2-1 in Ottawa on Sunday. Each team has 15 games left. Chicago is at St. Louis Wednesday.

""This is the playoff stretch right now,"" Reaves said. ""We're playing a lot of teams that we're in the mix with and tied with and chasing, so these are points we've really got to steal and start getting some separation.""

Ryan Suter and Matt Dumba scored for Minnesota, which lost for the first time in five games. The Wild remained two points ahead of Colorado for the final Western Conference wild-card spot.

""Things are going in the right direction, so we have to make sure we focus on that coming off this,"" center Ryan Carter said.

Lehtera was back following a three-game absence after being hit in the face by a puck on Feb. 25. Off a turnover, he beat Devan Dubnyk with a slap shot 7:44 into the game for a 1-0 lead. St. Louis had seven of the game's first eight shots.

Less than two minutes later, Reaves' wrist shot from the right circle beat Dubnyk on the glove side for a soft goal. Minnesota unsuccessfully challenged that St. Louis was offside. In consultation with league hockey operations staff, the officials ruled Kyle Brodziak had possession and control of the puck entering the zone, even though he skated in backward with his skates crossing the blue line before the puck.

Wild coach John Torchetti was diplomatic, saying his team needed to move on once the call was made. Dubnyk, however, said more.

""This is the play that they brought the coaches challenge in for, this exact play,"" Dubnyk said. ""It's so offside that both our defensemen stopped playing and all of a sudden they have twice as much room as they would because both our guys stopped playing. You have guys on the other bench that are laughing after the goal is called, and I mean, it's just added to the list of interesting calls on challenges for everywhere around the league this year.

""If you put that video up and you didn't know what that call was -- if it was offside or onside -- and you argued if he had possession or not, I think it's pretty obvious.""

Another bad goal gave the Blues a 3-0 lead midway through the second, when Berglund -- alone at the edge of the left circle -- scored on a rebound.

Dubnyk, who finished with 13 saves, was replaced by Kuemper -- who had 18 saves.

Minnesota rallied in the third, starting when Suter scored midway through the period on a backhander in front. Dumba scored with 5:20 to play to make it 3-2, but Fabbri added an empty-net goal with 1:31 to go.

The brainchild of U.K.-based OpenWorks Engineering, SkyWall 100 uses a compressed air launcher to fire smart projectiles at targeted drones.

Related: White House gets drone defense wake-up call

The system, which has a range of 328 feet, uses a high-tech scope to lock on to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). An onboard computer then tracks the targets flight path and calculates the trajectory required for the projectile to intercept either a hovering or flying drone.

The canister-style projectile opens up when it reaches the drone and uses a net to capture the flying device. The projectile then deploys a parachute to bring the captured drone and the canister components safely back to the ground.

OpenWorks Engineering believes that physically capturing a drone can be extremely useful for law enforcement. Once captured it can be impounded, forensically investigated or simply handed back with some words of education where appropriate, it explained, in a statement, adding that the risk of damaging the drone is also reduced.

SkyWall 100 will be exhibited at a U.K. government Security and Policing event on March 8. OpenWorks Engineering says that it is working with a number of governments and private organizations around the world and expects to see the first SkyWall 100 systems in use before the end of 2016.

A spokesman for OpenWorks Engineering told FoxNews.com that the system will be demonstrated in Canada in the coming months.

Drones, thanks to their small size and ability to hover low over the ground, can pose a huge security headache, as evidenced last year when a quadcopter drone crashed onto the White House grounds. In 2014 an international soccer game between Serbia and Albania was abandoned after a drone carrying a political banner caused a brawl between players from the two teams.

Technologies touted to combat UAVs include a new breed of interceptor drones. Michigan Tech University, for example, has developed an anti-UAV octocopter that uses a net to disable smaller drones.

Police forces are exploring multiple methods to tackle drones. The Dutch National Police, for example, have trained an eagle to take down UAVs.

A new study shows the moon is likely to break apart before it hits the atmosphere, creating a debris ring that will encircle Mars for millions of years.

The research, published in this weeks Nature Geoscience, follows a report earlier this month that not only is Phobos losing altitude due to Mars gravity, it also already is showing signs of structurally stress from tidal forces.

NEWS: Mars Moon Phobos Is Double-Doomed

Phobos survived a giant impact early in its history, but damage from the crash left the moon weak, say Benjamin Black and Tushar Mittal, planetary scientists with University of California at Berkeley.

Their study shows that in 20 million to 40 million years, Phobos will break apart, leaving a cloud of debris that will relatively quickly assembly into a ring around Mars.

Initially, the ring will be as dense as Saturns rings today, and it will last for up to 100 million years, the study shows.

For Earthlings, Phobos demise presents a unique opportunity to study what may be the solar systems last inwardly migrating moon.

Inwardly migrating satellites  some of which may break up tidally, some of which may collide with their primaries  are likely to be an under-appreciated and important component of planetary evolution, the authors note.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,'Bosch' star Jeri Ryan proud of bimbo-free career,['Paulette Cohn'],"Jeri Ryan plays a former stripper/hooker/porn star on the second season of the Amazon series ""Bosch,"" but her character is no bimbo.

Based on author Michael Connelly's novels about LAPD Det. Harry Bosch (Titus Welliver), the series has captured the hard-boiled school of detective fiction to a T.

Season 2 is based predominantly on the novel ""Trunk Music,"" providing Det. Bosch a major crime to solve, and the requisite femme fatale.

The seductress in question is played by Ryan, who takes on the role of Veronica Allen, who married an Armenian gangster/porn producer to give her a life of wealth and comfort.

""She's got quite a colorful past, and I think she gets Bosch a little bit unbalanced,"" Ryan told FOX411. ""He's not entirely sure what her real motives are. It takes him a while to figure out, I think, what's really going on with her.""

Ryan, of course, is best known for her role as the Borg Seven of Nine on ""Star Trek: Voyager,"" which featured her in a figure-hugging silver ensemble that left so little to the imagination that it may as well have been spray painted on.

The mother of two -- son Jack, 21, and daughter Gisele, 8 -- who graduated from Lone Oak High School in Paducah, Ky. as a National Merit Scholar, says she is comfortable playing blond bombshells if the character is written right.

""I don't have any interest in playing a bimbo,"" Ryan says. ""I don't have any interest in playing a character that's completely objectified, and I've been very lucky in my career that I haven't had to. So as long as the character is strong, smart and developed well, then I have no problem with what her physical appearance is or how she dresses.""

Sitting with Ryan in a suite at the historic Sunset Tower Hotel in West Hollywood, it is obvious that if need be, she could still fit into her Seven of Nine outfit, which is amazing when you consider she is married to French chef Christophe Eme, who happens to be a fan of the Bosch novels, and that the couple owned and operated Ortolan in West Hollywood for seven years.

""I've always been a foodie, so I used to cook a lot more before I met my husband, because once you have a chef in the family, if he can do it better and 20 times faster, I'm going to let him do it,"" she says. ""But I do love to cook.""

Ortolan shuttered in 2011, so Ryan, who took a year off from acting to be in the front of the house for service at night and in the office during the day to get it going, is now back to juggling acting with motherhood.

""It's balancing having a career and being there for your family, which is more important to me,"" she says when asked her biggest challenge these days. ""Our daughter just turned 8; it just goes so fast, and my son is now 21. He's out of the house, so you blink your eyes and you miss it. I feel like I missed so much of my son's childhood when I was on 'Voyager' when he was 3 or 4 years old because I was on set all the time, so I was very determined that it was going to be a very different experience with my daughter, because I don't want to miss all this precious time.""

Season 2 of ""Bosch"" begins streaming on Friday, March 11 on Amazon.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Many athletes used Sharapova drug meldonium during 2015 European Games, study finds",[],"The use of meldonium - the banned drug taken by Russian tennis champion Maria Sharapova - was widespread among elite athletes competing at the European Games in Baku last year, according to research in the British Journal of Sports Medicine (BJSM).

The study, based on information volunteered by athletes and individual medical teams, and on laboratory data from doping tests from the Games in Azerbaijan, suggested up to 490 athletes may have been taking the drug during the competition.

The findings showed that during the Baku Games, 13 medallists or competition winners were taking meldonium, 66 athletes tested positive for it, and they said meldonium was detected in athletes competing in 15 of the 21 sports in the competition.

""This study highlights the widespread and inappropriate use and prescribing of this prescription drug in a generally healthy athlete population,"" said the researchers, led by Klaus Steinbach and Christian Schneider of the European Olympic Committees Medical and Anti-Doping Commission.

Some 6,000 athletes took part in the Games, the first major multi-sports event for the continent, with qualification spots on offer for August's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

The BJSM said the research, published online on Wednesday, had been shared with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and had contributed to its decision to ban use of meldonium in competitive sport as of Jan. 1 this year.

Sharapova tested positive for meldonium, also known by the brand name Mildronate, in a sample taken on Jan. 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter-final defeat to Serena Williams.

She told a news conference her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year-old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation said.

Meldonium is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks , which told Reuters the drug could protect athletes from cell damage, but would be unlikely to improve their competitive performance.

The BJSM study said, however, that ""the drug is evidently being used with the intention to either improve recovery or enhance performance - (and) use of a substance with the intention to improve performance is, by WADA's definition, a violation of the spirit of sport"".

Mildronate is registered for sale in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, but does not have a license from either the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the EU's European Medicines Agency.

Steinbach and Schneider said since the samples and data from laboratories were ""blinded"" of all personal and demographic details, they could not say which specific countries the athletes who tested positive for meldonium came from.

Athletes' self-reported declarations of meldonium use suggested there is higher use in countries where the drug is registered and prescribed then in countries where meldonium is not registered for medical use, they said.

They added, however, that ""athletes and healthcare providers from any country where the drug is not officially registered for medical use could easily obtain the drug through medicines importation and exportation routes, and even more easily through online purchases"".",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,"Back yard cooking with coal beds, pits, stone ovens -- even cauldrons",['Katie Jackson'],"The general populations primitive cooking experience is mostly limited to roasting a marshmallow over an open flame. But smores can also be considered a gateway to the entire genre of archaic cooking.

Long before GE and Kenmore came along, past generations relied, and thrived, on everything from coal beds, pit cooking, stone ovens and even cauldrons.

Sure, bare bones cooking in your backyard can be time consuming, but there are two substantial benefits. Its more cost effectivenot requiring expensive cooking equipment, gas or electricityand its healthierone of the reasons for our ancestors fit physiques.

Spring is the perfect time to take a sabbatical from your microwave and stainless steel appliances. All you is need sufficient outdoor space, knowledge of the local lawsespecially if you bring backyard butchery into the pictureand homemade heat. Youll also have to do some homework. No one wants their house to go down in flames because they tried roasting a pig prematurely. Here are a few pointers from primitive cooking professionals to get you started.

1. Practice, Not Precision

These cooking methods are meant to be engaging throwbacks. Since youre not using sophisticated tools, it can take a lot of practice to produce the desired results. Have a sense of humor with the mistakes and at least taste the edible errors. You never know, a failure in aesthetics can equal a flavor home run.

2. Its the Pits but You Have to be Present

The inspiration for your pit should stem from what you want to cook, says Zak Walters, chef and co-owner of Salts Cure in Los Angeles. Keeping in mind pit cooking is for slow, low cookingi.e. roasts, or pot dishes needing to be well done. Position your pit far away from anything structural like a fence or a tree, Walters adds, And remember, cooking in a pit means cooking with an open flame so you must be present at all times. Still, Walters insists cooking this way is not a chore but rather, an interactive good excuse to spend a few hours enjoying your yard.

3. Non-Toxic Tastes Better

Natalie Bogwalker, the founder of Wild Abundance and an ancestral foods cooking class instructor in Asheville, N.C. emphasizes the importance of using non-toxic fire starters. When she prepares steaks outside, she cooks sans pan or grill. After the fire has died down to a glowing bed of coals she cooks the meat directly on them. As long as you use hardwoods like hickory or oak, the coal and ash residue is entirely edible, she insists.

4. Use Your Imagination for Ingredients

After youve nailed the lower hanging fruits like vegetables, chicken and flank steak, experiment with more exotic proteins. In his Las Vegas backyard, ""Top Chef Masters"" Season 2 runner-up Chef Rick Moonen has prepared everything from rabbit, elk, home made bacon, wood roasted goat and even Burgooa Kentucky style gumboin his new cauldron. The important thing, especially when dealing with unfamiliar ingredients, is to make sure you have reached the appropriate temperature and you cook your meat thoroughly.

5. Be Aware of Your Surroundings

Horseback Bob, a.k.a. Bob Hansler, has been cooking without pots and pans in his backyard since he was a kid preparing fish he caught with his father. He believes the more resourceful you are, the more rewarding the experience. His YouTube channel features videos on how to cook ramen in a cactus, boil eggs with rocks and bake eggs in clay. If you know whats in your yard and how to use it, youre not at the mercy of conventional means, he says. For example, the power goes out. If you know how to use stones to make a pizza oven, youre all set.

According to a new study, adult male gorillas in the wild, including the dominant silverbacks, sing and hum more during feeding than their younger or female counterparts.

The researchers only observed the behavior in males in connection with food, especially while the gorillas ate aquatic vegetation, flowers, and seeds. Writing in the journal PLOS ONE, the authors suggest that this food-associated calling may be a means of expressing well-being. They also propose that it could aid group coordination and social cohesion.

""Similar to the function of food-calls in chimpanzees, gorillas may call to let their group mates know when it is time to finish eating, said Eva Maria Luef, who along with her colleague Simone Pika at the Humboldt Research Group at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology and Thomas Breuer from the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York, conducted the study. ""Silverback males may have to call more frequently since they are often the ones initiating changes in group activity"", she further explained.

Females and juveniles were quieter, perhaps to reduce these vulnerable individuals risk of predation, the researchers said.

The researchers only assessed 20 gorillas in the two groups, and did not analyze singing and humming calls separately in relation to specific foods. Nonetheless, they note that their findings provide new insight into the vocal abilities of gorillas and may provide new opportunities to investigate the development of vocal communication.

Many mammals and birds vocalize when finding or consuming certain foods. The phenomenon had been studied in chimps and bonobos, but only anecdotal evidence previously existed for gorillas.

Doctors surgically removed the uterus Tuesday.

Other countries have attempted uterus transplants, with some reported failures, although Sweden has succeeded in five healthy births. The experimental treatment might eventually offer an option for women born without a uterus or who lost it to disease.

foxnews.com,2015-12-07 00:00:00,"In an increasingly dangerous world, Obama has checked out as commander in chief",['Sen Scott Brown'],"Ben Franklin said that death and taxes were the two certainties of life. A third certainty in our country used to be strong leadership from the individual in the Oval Office. Abraham Lincoln, F.D.R, John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and many others have used their position as our commander in chief to exude Americas strength on the world stage and promote our nations unique exceptionalism.

However, on several recent big issues, President Obama has not taken the challenging, but necessary step up to the plate to demonstrate why America needs to lead in the world. His actions instead seem to suggest that we can lead from behind, which goes against everything that our country has stood for in the past.

The best example of this is President Obamas utter failure to address the danger that ISIS presents to the United States. Their sickening attacks in Paris are still fresh in our mind, but it is important to note that just hours before the terrorists attacked the city, President Obama said that ISIS was contained and on the run.

Following the attacks, instead of stepping forward and adopting an aggressive strategy to take the fight to ISIS, the president deferred and continued to give off the impression that our current strategy to combat radical Islamic terrorism is working. His response showed that he is either delusional to the real threat ISIS presents our nation or he is simply incapable of providing authentic leadership for the sake of the country and the globe.

For generations, when the world faced a dangerous force or an intimidating challenge, the United States of America has been the nation to step forward and provide leadership. If we want to continue being a unique and exceptional nation, that is a principle that we cannot abandon, especially right now with the seriousness of the threats facing our country and the world.

Then last week, following the devastating tragedy in San Bernardino, President Obama immediately leapt to blame gun laws and Republicans, when in fact the attacks appear to have been perpetrated by ISIS sympathizers. The fact that the President would try to score political points instead of committing to once-and-for-all going after Americas greatest threat is emblematic of his entire presidency, putting politics and party before country and leadership.

While it seems President Obama has already checked out on his White House responsibilities and is looking forward to writing his memoirs and building his library, the absence of American leadership has now become a defining issue of the 2016 presidential election.

On one side, there are Republican candidates who all know and understand that America must operate from a position of strength, and adhere to the ideas espoused by Ronald Reagan about leadership and action. They will all say what needs to be said, do what needs to be done, and lead when the world needs to be led.

On the other side, there is Hillary Clinton, President Obamas former Secretary of State and the architect of his disastrous foreign policy agenda who also jumped at the chance last week to put political points on the board, instead of promoting a strong strategy to defeat ISIS. Secretary Clintons lack of understanding about ISIS was crystal clear at the most recent Democratic debate, when she said that the fight against ISIS cannot be an American fight.

Secretary Clinton, it must be an American fight. For generations, when the world faced a dangerous force or an intimidating challenge, the United States of America has been the nation to step forward and provide leadership. If we want to continue being a unique and exceptional nation, that is a principle that we cannot abandon, especially right now with the seriousness of the threats facing our country and the world.

For the past seven years, we have seen what it looks like when America doesnt take charge, but instead sits in the backseat as a global observer. As a result, our country is less safe, less secure, and people have a rational fear of another heinous act of terrorism coming to our shores.

Instead of electing someone such as Hillary Clinton, who outlined President Obamas global agenda and agrees with his worldview, we need to elect a president that understands the importance of American leadership, and will reassert our nation as the leading force for good in the world.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Iran reportedly test-fires 2 long-range missiles while Biden visits Israel,[],"Iran reportedly test-fired two ballistic missiles Wednesday with the phrase ""Israel must be wiped out"" written in Hebrew on them, but authorities said that the tests do not violate the nuclear deal reached in January.

The tests came as Vice President Joe Biden visited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was strongly opposed to the nuke deal.

I want to reiterate because I know people still doubt: If in fact they break the deal, we will act, Biden said in Jerusalem.

The semiofficial Fars news agency offered pictures Wednesday it said were of the Qadr H missiles being fired. It said they were fired in Iran's eastern Alborz mountain range to hit a target some 870 miles away off Iran's coast into the Sea of Oman.

Hard-liners in Iran's military have fired rockets and missiles despite U.S. objections since the deal, as well as shown underground missile bases on state television.

The missiles fired today are the results of sanctions, Brig. Gen. Hossein Salami, a deputy commander of the Guards told Fars news agency, according to the BBC. The sanctions helped Iran develop its missile program.

There was no immediate reaction from Jerusalem, where Biden was scheduled to speak to Netanyahu.

The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which patrols that region, declined to comment on the test. Fars quoted Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard's aerospace division, saying the test was aimed at showing Israel that Iran could hit it.

Iranian state television showed one of the missiles being fired from an underground silo sometime overnight, Reuters reported.

""The 1,240-mile range of our missiles is to confront the Zionist regime,"" Hajizadeh said. ""Israel is surrounded by Islamic countries and it will not last long in a war. It will collapse even before being hit by these missiles.""

Israel's Foreign Ministry declined to immediately comment. Iran has threatened to destroy Israel in the past. Israel, which is believed to have the only nuclear weapons arsenal in the Mideast, repeatedly has threatened to take military action against Iran's nuclear facilities.

Hajizadeh stressed Iran would not fire the missiles in anger or start a war with Israel.

""We will not be the ones who start a war, but we will not be taken by surprise, so we put our facilities somewhere that our enemies cannot destroy them so that we could continue long war,"" he said.

The firing of the Qadr H missiles comes after a U.S. State Department spokesman on Tuesday criticized another missile launch that day, saying America planned to bring it before the United Nations Security Council.

A nuclear deal between Iran and world powers including the U.S. is now under way, negotiated by the administration of moderate President Hassan Rouhani. In the time since the deal, however, hard-liners in Iran's military have made several shows of strength.

In October, Iran successfully test-fired a new guided long-range ballistic surface-to-surface missile. It was the first such test since Iran and world powers reached a landmark nuclear deal last summer.

U.N. experts said the launch used ballistic missile technology banned under a Security Council resolution. In January, the U.S. imposed new sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the ballistic missile program.

Iran also has fired rockets near U.S. warships and flown an unarmed drone over an American aircraft carrier in recent months.

In January, Iran seized 10 U.S. sailors in the Gulf when their two riverine command boats headed from Kuwait to Bahrain ended up in Iranian territorial waters after the crews ""misnavigated,"" the U.S. military said. The sailors were taken to a small port facility on Farsi Island, held for about 15 hours and released after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke several times with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Many athletes used Sharapova drug meldonium during 2015 European Games, study finds",[],"The use of meldonium - the banned drug taken by Russian tennis champion Maria Sharapova - was widespread among elite athletes competing at the European Games in Baku last year, according to research in the British Journal of Sports Medicine (BJSM).

The study, based on information volunteered by athletes and individual medical teams, and on laboratory data from doping tests from the Games in Azerbaijan, suggested up to 490 athletes may have been taking the drug during the competition.

The findings showed that during the Baku Games, 13 medallists or competition winners were taking meldonium, 66 athletes tested positive for it, and they said meldonium was detected in athletes competing in 15 of the 21 sports in the competition.

""This study highlights the widespread and inappropriate use and prescribing of this prescription drug in a generally healthy athlete population,"" said the researchers, led by Klaus Steinbach and Christian Schneider of the European Olympic Committees Medical and Anti-Doping Commission.

Some 6,000 athletes took part in the Games, the first major multi-sports event for the continent, with qualification spots on offer for August's Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

The BJSM said the research, published online on Wednesday, had been shared with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and had contributed to its decision to ban use of meldonium in competitive sport as of Jan. 1 this year.

Sharapova tested positive for meldonium, also known by the brand name Mildronate, in a sample taken on Jan. 26, the day of her Australian Open quarter-final defeat to Serena Williams.

She told a news conference her family doctor had first given her the drug 10 years ago after she frequently became sick, had irregular electrocardiogram results, a magnesium deficiency and a family history of diabetes.

The 28-year-old Russian, a five-time grand slam champion, will be provisionally suspended starting March 12, the International Tennis Federation said.

Meldonium is marketed as Mildronate by the Latvian pharmaceutical firm Grindeks , which told Reuters the drug could protect athletes from cell damage, but would be unlikely to improve their competitive performance.

The BJSM study said, however, that ""the drug is evidently being used with the intention to either improve recovery or enhance performance - (and) use of a substance with the intention to improve performance is, by WADA's definition, a violation of the spirit of sport"".

Mildronate is registered for sale in Latvia, Lithuania, Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, but does not have a license from either the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the EU's European Medicines Agency.

Steinbach and Schneider said since the samples and data from laboratories were ""blinded"" of all personal and demographic details, they could not say which specific countries the athletes who tested positive for meldonium came from.

Athletes' self-reported declarations of meldonium use suggested there is higher use in countries where the drug is registered and prescribed then in countries where meldonium is not registered for medical use, they said.

They added, however, that ""athletes and healthcare providers from any country where the drug is not officially registered for medical use could easily obtain the drug through medicines importation and exportation routes, and even more easily through online purchases"".",[]

The American Diner is a gun-toting, beef-eating, Constitution-loving establishment owned by Michael Tassone.

Click here to join Todds American Dispatch  a must-read for Conservatives!

Mr. Tassone is a no-nonsense God & Country fellow who takes pride in Old Glory and his signature Animal Burger  made from 24 ounces of American Love.

We talk religions and politics and we encourage people to carry their guns, Mr. Tassone told me. The Second Amendment protects all the rest of them.

They also encourage folks to say Grace.

 If people dont like it  they can go to Dennys, he said.

And just so diners arent caught off-guard, they post their talking points on the menu.

 We dont like political correctness or special interest

 If you really dont like America  LEAVE

 Actually, I did build MY business

 Everyone doesnt get the same size trophy

 Govt and taxes are the problem

And these days Mr. Tassone is especially upset with the government.

On Dec. 31, 2015, the state of New York implemented a new minimum wage for tipped workers. Wages increased from $5 to $7.50 an hour.

Its absolutely killing us, Mr. Tassone told me. My payroll has gone up over $21,000. We have to find a way to pay for that.

Its a problem facing family-owned restaurants across New York, reports the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. Many have been forced to pass along the additional costs to their customers.

I had to lay off a worker and I have to work 103 hours a week, he said. I just have to try to take on additional time and hours to make it work.

And he also decided to poke a bit of fun at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and President Obama by naming a new breakfast special in their honor.

Its called the Dictator Obama/NYS Special (King Cuomo).

The breakfast includes two eggs and a slice of toast for $3.59. The tax is $27.99.

We took a good jab at them, he said.

As you might imagine, the Obama special isnt exactly selling like hot cakes.

If they really want to pay that much for two eggs and a piece of toast, well sell it to them, he said.

Mr. Tassone illustrated how difficult its becoming to run a business in America. Theres only so much you can tax consumers.

On the other hand, a sandwich named after the first lady is one of the diners hottest items.

Its called, The Anti-Michelle Obama, Dont Tell Me What to Eat or Feed My Kids Burger.

Its a 16-ounce beef patty with bacon and cheese  along with a side of fries.

He might want to throw in a pack of Rolaids, too.

""I wouldn't recommend anyone try to outrun a volcano, but there's a few of us that could,"" said Greg Valentine, a volcanologist at the University at Buffalo in New York.

By analyzing rocks trapped in volcanic ash, Valentine and his colleagues discovered the lethal ash flow spread at street speeds  about 10 to 45 mph. It might be hard to sustain this pace on foot, but it's certainly possible by car. [Big Blasts: History's 10 Most Destructive Volcanoes]

The findings were published March 7 in the journal Nature Communications.

""It's really interesting how you can have such a violent eruption producing such slow-moving flows,"" said Valentine, co-author of the new study. ""They still devastate a huge area, but they're slow and concentrated and dense,"" he told Live Science. His collaborators include Olivier Roche, of Blaise Pascal University in France and David Buesch, of the U.S. Geological Survey.

Of course, the safest way to deal with any rumbling volcano is to get as far away as possible. Lots of distance can prevent the most common cause of death associated with volcanoes: being trapped and suffocated by a torrent of ash, rocks and superhot gas that explode out at speeds of up to 300 mph. These ""pyroclastic flows"" are the real volcanic killer, not lava. A pyroclastic flow wiped out the Roman town of Pompeii, and in 1902, Mount Pelee on Martinique unleashed a pyroclastic flow that killed some 29,000 people. [Preserved Pompeii: Photos Reveal City of Ash]

You should still evacuate

Volcanologists try to account for such hazards when planning for future disasters. But it's hard to know what will happen when a supervolcano the size of Yellowstone blows its top. The last supereruption on Earth was 74,000 years ago, in Toba, Indonesia. Looking at the rocky remains of past supereruptions can reveal how and why supervolcanoes erupt.

When a supervolcano blew in Arizona 18.8 million years ago, the ash spread more than 100 miles. This single layer, called the Peach Springs Tuff, is more than 450 feet thick in the area close to the volcano and 10 feet thick at its edge, 100 miles away. (A tuff is a volcanic rock made of solidified ash.)

The researchers measured rocks at the bottom of the tuff in Arizona that were carried in the flow. They matched unique rock types back to their source, and found that many of the rocks, whether fist-size or boulders, were carried no farther than a football field.

Accounting for the size and position of these rocks helped the researchers build a model of how fast and thick the ash flow was as it traveled. It turns out that only a dense, slow-moving pyroclastic flow could suck up the rocks from the surface and trundle them along. A fast, relatively thin flow would have to reach impossible speeds  up to 1,454 mph  to carry the rocks, the researchers found.

""I think it's plausible but speculative,"" said Calvin Miller, a volcanologist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, who was not involved in the study. ""It will be interesting to see how the [scientific] community responds to it. Even if they're right for the Peach Springs Tuff, this is just part of a continuum of eruption styles,"" Miller told Live Science.

The origins of the Peach Springs Tuff can be spotted in southwestern Arizona's Black Mountains, near the town of Oatman. The eruption left behind a very large crater called a caldera, though it has been mostly obliterated by erosion and faulting.

The caldera, called Silver Creek, spewed magma for several days, releasing a volume of about 1,000 times the Mississippi River's daily flow at New Orleans, Valentine said. ""If you think about 1,000 Mississippi Rivers coming out of the ground, you can see how [the ash] would have spread out across a huge area,"" he said.

However, one expert on the Peach Springs Tuff doesn't buy the scenario. Charles Ferguson, a research geologist with the Arizona Geological Survey, said there are outcrops that suggest the ash moved quickly and energetically, like a typical pyroclastic flow.

""I think their hypothesis is more problematic than explanatory,"" Ferguson told Live Science.

Southwestern supervolcanoes

The Peach Springs Tuff covers parts of Arizona, Nevada and California, from Barstow, California, to Peach Springs, Arizona. Geologists use the creamy white and pink rock as a unique marker in the region.

The western United States suffered at least 100 of these huge eruptions starting about 40 million years ago (a consequence of shifting tectonic plates). It's not clear whether every one of these supervolcanic blasts sent out slowly moving ash flows, but Valentine said he sees similar evidence in other areas.

The powerful Peach Springs eruption ejected 72 cubic miles of pulverized rock into the air. For comparison, the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington blasted out 0.24 cubic miles of material. And the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines spewed 2.4 cubic miles of material.

Any supereruption will likely come with a fair amount of warning, similar to the bulge that foreshadowed the Mount St. Helens eruption. The new findings suggest that people living near a supervolcano might have a few hours to evacuate once the disaster starts, the researchers said.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Police: Man who was deported in 2004 held in connection to 5 deaths in the Midwest,[],"Police walk near a house where a man was found murdered on March 8, 2016, near New Florence, Mo.ap

An extensive manhunt for a Mexican man who had been deported more than a decade ago and is now suspected of killing five people in Kansas and Missouri ended early Wednesday morning, authorities said.

Missouri Highway Patrol told reporters that Pablo Antonio Serrano-Vitorino, who had been living in the U.S. illegally for an undetermined amount of time, was arrested after he was found lying on a hill just north of Interstate 70 in Montgomery County, Missouri.

According to Kansas City Star, he was taken into custody near a McDonalds restaurant without trouble and no shots were fired.

""He looked exhausted,"" Sgt. James Hedrick told the newspaper.

Serrano-Vitorino is accused of fatally shooting four men late Monday night at his neighbor's home in Kansas City, Kansas. He was also wanted in connection with the shooting death of 49-year-old Randy Nordman in Montgomery County  more than 170 miles away from his home in Kansas.

The manhunt, which included helicopters, police dogs and at least one SWAT team, began late Monday after the first shooting. One of the four men managed to call police before he died, but it's unclear how the men knew each other or what may have prompted the shooting, Kansas City police officer Thomas Tomasic said.

Then on Tuesday, a truck Serrano-Vitorino was believed to be driving was found about 7 a.m. abandoned along I-70 in central Missouri, about 80 miles west of St. Louis.

About 25 minutes later, sheriff's deputies responded to a shooting about 5 miles away at a Montgomery County home and found the body of 49-year-old Nordman, according to the patrol. Highway Patrol Lt. Paul Reinsch said a witness who called 911 reported seeing a man running from Nordman's property, launching a manhunt of that area.

The patrol said Tuesday that Serrano-Vitorino was considered dangerous and may be armed with an AK-47.

Reinsch said investigators weren't aware of any connection between Serrano-Vitorino and Nordman, whose home is near his family's campground and a racetrack for remote-controlled cars.

Authorities haven't released the names of the four Kansas victims. Serrano-Vitorino was charged with four counts of first-degree murder in their killings, Wyandotte County District Attorney Jerome Gorman said.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a statement Tuesday night that Serrano-Vitorino had been deported from the U.S. in April 2004 and illegally re-entered ""on an unknown date."" ICE said it would place a detainer on Serrano-Vitorino if he is taken into custody.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,A Dads Devotion to His Son Will Never Falter,[],"Fatherhood is a life-changing experience for all men. As a 28-year-old dad to a wonderful three-year-old boy named Weston, Ive found the birth of my first child has been an experience unlike any other  there have been the promises I made to him before he even arrived; the tremendous love I feel for him; and the changes that are occurring within me each and every day.

After he was born I made a promise to him that my devotion to his happiness, as his father, would never falter. This promise kept me driven during the difficult times I experienced as the primary-care parent of an infant. My sons mother was not ready to be a parent  much less a primary-care parent  and so she made the choice to pursue her career goals while I raised our baby.

I took fatherhood very seriously. For the coming of our little son, I prepared my home meticulously. I researched child development and child care techniques. I started journals documenting every milestone he had. For the six months of his life, I stayed at home with Weston and it was the best decision I ever made. He has developed into the most wonderful little boy  as a result, I believe, of my ever-present commitment to his future.

The traditional notions that dads are breadwinners and not as capable of caring for young children are slowly being debunked.

Fathers are not only very capable of nurturing and caring for their babies, providing daily care for their toddler and guiding their children through the ups and downs of growing up  they are essential for their child's optimal development.

Studies support this: ""Even from birth, children who have an involved father are more likely to be emotionally secure, be confident to explore their surroundings, and, as they grow older, have better social connections with peers."" That's from a 2006 study, ""The Importance of Fathers in the Healthy Development of Children,"" from the Department of Health and Human Services.

And a Department of Education study done more than a decade ago found that highly involved biological fathers had children who were 43 percent more likely than other children to earn mostly A's, and they were 33 percent less likely than other children to repeat a grade.

With all of this in mind, I dove head-first into parenting, and soon learned there are certain steps you can take as a new father to ensure you're prepared.

1.) Always Be Organized.

My house was always neatly stocked with essentials. Safety items such as corner protectors, grooming kits, and electrical outlet plug covers are essential to keeping your home baby-friendly. I made boxes of diapers, wipes, bottles, blankets, infant clothes, baby powder, baby shampoo, and other everyday items easily accessible and available. Keep an inventory of items and substitute as the stock is depleted. Also, make your own baby food; it's not that hard and it's much healthier.

2.) Master a Routine.

The ""typical"" newborn routine is not at all typical. Expect to be up at all hours of the night feeding, rocking, changing, burping and soothing, especially at first. Keep soothing lullaby music at arms length. Youll be tired and sometimes overwhelmed. But a solid, stable routine is the best way to juggle parenting and adult life.

3.) Bond with Your Baby.

Do this even before he enters the world. Sing and talk to him while hes still in utero. I caressed his moms tummy and told my son stories, which helped him associate my voice with nurturing and love. This kind of pre-birth nurturing does amazing things for the parent-child bond.

4.) Relish Your Time with Your Baby.

Babies grow so fast! It is important to create memories and have these memories to share with your child when he or she gets older. Keep a scrapbook or even an online journal to help document your lives together.

5.) Become Familiar with Laws About Fatherhood in Your State.

If you are going to be a single parent, know that the current policy in all 50 states is that unmarried fathers have no rights to their children without a court order  sole custody is automatically awarded to the mother until the parents appear in court for a permanent order. My best suggestion: Immediately seek legal representation in order to protect your child's rights to a loving father. An experienced attorney can help you.

Being a dad is cool, fun, rewarding and life-changing. As the landscape of fatherhood changes, men from all over should be excited to ""Dad Up"" and begin an awesome experience with the best thing that ever happened to them: their own kid.

foxnews.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,The real reason to hire a veteran,['Ritch K'],"Ive grown tired of reading articles telling us why we should hire veterans. Most are written by people who never served in the military, and while well meaning, they are often patronizing:

 The unemployment rate of veterans is too high, so lets give them a job.

 They care for others, so lets care for them.

 We owe them our gratitude, so lets thank them for their service.

In fact, the most compelling reason is simple: veterans are often the best-qualified candidates. Period. While they may not have worked in a traditional office, or have an MBA, they do have strong leadership skills, understand how to work with diverse groups, work well under pressure, know how to solve problems, and appreciate what it really takes to work as part of a team. Veterans have been taught to win, often against overwhelming odds, because their lives depend on it. Veterans bring true real world experience to the workplace.

If you want your organization to have a competitive advantage, consider hiring a veteran with at least a few years of active duty under his or her belt. Better yet, hire one with combat experience.

Unfortunately, some people in todays organizations have preconceived notions against veterans: that they are inflexible, warmongers, and narrow in thought. According to the Defense Data Manpower Center, just .4 percent of the American population serve in the armed forces so its no surprise that we often misjudge and discount the contributions veterans can make.

From my experience serving in leadership roles in four different industries and as both an enlisted sailor and a naval officer, I have found that most newly minted MBAs or even those with a few years experience, lack real-world awareness and analytical skills that veterans possess.

Most veterans are ready to hit the ground running when they join an organization. They are used to dealing with multiple challenges, moving at a fast pace, and learning something new every day. They know how to lead, but understand that its also necessary to follow. Veterans appreciate the importance of achieving goals and winning because their actions often mean the difference between survival and death.

In my most recent book, ""Truth, Trust + Tenacity,"" I devote an entire chapter to lessons in leadership that can be learned from the armed forces.

I discuss how military officers are often expected to step up and take responsibility for their actions and behavior at a far younger age than those who enter the business world directly out of collegethose same Marines, soldiers and sailors are given active leadership roles and accountabilities far earlier as well. Through their experiences, they learn what authentic leadership means, including courage, a skill that is less obvious in the business world, but should be.

It takes courage to steer an organization into and through uncharted territory and to compete with fiercer and stronger brands. It takes courage to do the right thing by your co-workers and the people you manage or to win against a fierce competitor in the marketplace.

It takes courage to try a new strategy or introduce a new product.

If organizations want sophisticated, quantitative, analytical, logistical, and operational skillsand want people who can handle all of that under pressure, they need to hire veterans.

Veterans have demonstrated remarkable flexibility in critical situations, have experience overcoming practically every form of adversity, and have gained knowledge leading and motivating others. Members of the armed forces have been taught to remain calm when things get rough, and use creativity to solve problems.

More organizations need to hire veterans, but they need to hire them for the right reason: because they are often the best candidates for the job.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Saving Yazidis from ISIS, one captive at a time",['Hollie Mckay'],"Nearly 2,400 Yazidi men, women and children have been ransomed, rescued or lucky enough to escape the clutches of ISIS, according to new figures from a Kurdish government bureau that works closely with the minority Iraqi religious community.

The Yazidi community, with the protection of the Kurdish Regional Government and funding from around the world, has formed an extensive international network to save their women from sexual slavery and men from serving in the black-clad jihadist army.

The younger and more beautiful she is and the less number of children she has  if any  will make her more expensive. - Abu Shujaa

There are several ways, Abu Shujaa, who established a volunteer group with safe houses and has managed an underground rescue railroad to liberate hundreds of Yazidis since the ISIS onslaught in his hometown of Sinjar, told FoxNews.com. Sometimes the girls access phones and contact family members or friends and they get directed to us.

Other times, volunteers investigate and locate where the girls were taken, and when they find out they then reach out to them and arrange the escape, he added. There are other ways too, but we cant reveal yet as there are a whole lot of girls left we have to rescue.

The Kurdistan Regional Governments Office of the Prime Minister has a special bureau dedicated to observing the rescue of Yazidi victims. Although it plays no role in negotiating with captors, in cases in which family members pay ransom, the office reimburses them.

Of an estimated 4,029 Yazidi women and girls abducted over the last three years, some 1,456 have been rescued, according to statistics from the Kurdish government, which works with the Yazidi community.

While women are held by ISIS for sex, men are captured and forced into the terrorist army. Some 3,403 men and boys have been captured, with just more than 900 making it back to their families. In total, some 1,293 Yazidis have been killed by ISIS, many of them among the men and boys taken and given the choice of joining ISIS or being killed. Another 460 remain unaccounted for.

Related Image Expand / Contract Shujaa, seen here with former Yazidi captives, cannot divulge all the methods used to free women from ISIS. (Special to FoxNews.com)

The tight-knit community, which is concentrated along the nations northern Ninevah Plain, has endured horrific suffering since the rise of ISIS. Of a population estimated at 550,000 before the terrorist army began its ethnic and religious cleansing campaign, some 400,000 have been displaced according to the directorate.

While entering ISIS-held territory could mean death for Yazidis, they have a network of civilian women trapped inside Mosul and other places within the so-called caliphate who want to do something good for humanity and help, according to Shujaa.

With help from their Kurdish allies, as well as Muslim sympathizers, Yazidis have pulled together to deliver their women and girls from the misery inflicted by ISIS. The Yazidi religion includes elements of ancient nature-worship, as well as influences from Christianity, Gnosticism, Zoroastrianism, Islam and Judaism, and ISIS justifies its slavery and slaughter under the guise that Yazidis are devil worshippers.

By enslaving women, ISIS is effectively cleansing the lands of Yazidi and other minority groups of their ethnic identity, said Daniel Sullivan, director of policy and government relations at the Washington-based nonprofit United to End Genocide.

Rescue typically involves several intermediaries carrying out a series of steps such as smuggling cellphones and counterfeit IDs into the places where the girls are being held, establishing a network of safe houses and long journeys on foot under cover of darkness.

The process has been managed and supervised by the family of the victims themselves, said Yakhi Balak, who heads a Yazidi task force that works with the Kurdistan Regional Government to facilitate and track rescue operations. The family coordinates with their religious leaders with the moral support of local Yazidi communities.

Each successful rescue has its own dramatic and harrowing tale. The family of one girl told FoxNews.com their daughter was granted permission to use her captors phone and was able to alert outsiders with a rough description of her location. That allowed Yazidi activists to put a plan into place, working with contacts inside Mosul. Another girl told of escaping through a broken window when her captor was not at home. She hid in a sympathetic familys home until smugglers could reach her.

Such escapes are the exception, not the rule. Most Yazidis who have made it out of ISIS captivity owe their freedom to ransom paid by loved ones and with funds raised by international charities. Fees for buying back a Yazidi captive vary wildly  as do the prices wealthy Arabs and ISIS fighters pay for them at stomach-turning auctions held in public squares.

The younger and more beautiful she is and the less number of children she has  if any  will make her more expensive, Shujaa said. Every girl comes back with a unique story that is very powerful and emotional. Some of them as young as 8 are being raped and enslaved. A few days ago, a beautiful 11-year-old girl was sold at the market in Raqqa for the equivalent of $20,000.

Ransom fees generally must cover whatever the slave buyer paid, plus a profit and, in most cases, a cut for Sunni tribesmen who often facilitate negotiations. Just over a year ago, a Yazidi family could buy back a daughter for as little as $300. Now, the price can top $13,000, according to Yazidi officials.

In many cases the local wealthy Arab residents were among the buyers of sex slaves, Balak said. Different prices were paid at the time of purchase and in some cases slaves were sold for a profit. Buy back prices were usually higher than slave market price.

Many Yazidi families have scraped together the money needed for a loved ones safe return only to find out theyve been tricked, an Iraqi with close ties to the government in Baghdad said.

The scammers are everywhere, he said. They are in Iraq and they are outside of Iraq. Its terrible.

Rescue groups have raised funds in North America, including through GoFundMe.com. The efforts have raised alarms in some quarters, both that donors could be getting scammed and also that, even if the funds go to ransom, the process makes captives more valuable and the money ends up in the hands of ISIS.

The lack of monitoring on the ground means Western governments must clamp down on funds headed for the caliphate, even if intentions are good, said Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, director of Israel Law Center, which focuses on blocking funding to terror groups.

A representative for crowd-funding platform GoFundMe told FoxNews.com that red flags have indeed been raised as to whether campaigns of this nature have directed funds to ISIS in order to secure the release of hostages, and that they have referred matters to the Office of Foreign Assets Control with concerns over violations of U.S. sanctions.

A spokesperson for the U.S Department of the Treasury responded that online donations are not a significant contributor to ISILs wealth.

Rather, it remains the case that ISIL has generated the vast majority of its funds through oil and gas, extortion, and looting banks in the regions that it controls, the spokesperson said.

Liberating a young girl from the clutches of ISIS is worth whatever a heartsick parent  or a determined community  can afford, said Balak.

However, other than some sort of cash exchange there are seemingly few other options to bring back the innocent victims.

Looking at the greater human tragic picture, rescuing a human being in the hands of savages should not be counted toward terrorism funding, Balak added.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,American murdered in Israel was West Point grad who served in Iraq and Afghanistan,[],"Taylor Force excelled at everything he did. As a Boy Scout, he attained the highest, most difficult rank: Eagle Scout. The descendent of generations of soldiers, Force was a National Honor Society member at New Mexico Military Institute, and then went on to West Point. He served in Afghanistan and Iraq, making it home from the war zones alive and with his positive outlook intact.

But the smart and promising 28-year-old was struck down in his prime by a Palestinian terrorists blade on Tuesday, one of multiple stabbing attacks in Israel that resulted in a dozen police and civilian casualties. Force, in Israel to study entrepreneurship with his Vanderbilt business school classmates, was the only victim killed.

""You hear of tragic stories that happen overseas, terrorist attacks, you know. California obviously, within the last six months in Paris, Forces friend Seth Thompson told LEX18. But now, unfortunately we have been touched with it -- have been cursed with it.

A Lubbock, Texas, native, Force came from an extensive military background, his former Scoutmaster, Marty Northern, told Everything Lubbock. His grandfather and father had both served.

He wanted to follow into that tradition, Northern said.

""He exemplified the spirit of discovery, learning and service."" - Nicholas Zeppos, Vanderbilt chancellor

At school, Force, a good-looking kid with an action-hero name, mixed a love for athletics with academic distinction. He ran track and field and cross country in high school while also earning the grades for the National Honor Society and working toward the pinnacle achievement of scouting. At West Point, he received his bachelors degree in engineering and industrial management in 2009 and was also a member of the ski team, according to his LinkedIn profile.

He was such a hard worker, an Eagle Scout, and loved by everybody, his father, Stuart Force, told Everything Lubbock.

Force served as a field artillery officer from 2009 to 2014 at Fort Hood and had deployments in Afghanistan and Iraq. He also spent some time working at his familys horse business in Lexington, friends told LEX18.

Eventually, Force trained his sights on an MBA and chose Vanderbilt, in part, because of the universitys support for veterans and diversity of students, according to a November profile in Poets & Quants.

In addition to learning the skills needed to be successful in business, I want to establish life-long connections and friendships with my fellow students from the U.S. and around the globe, Force said. Also, Vanderbilt already does a terrific job being a part of and giving back to the community; I would like to help maintain and promote that altruistic culture.

That desire to connect with students around the globe is what eventually took Force to Israel, along with 29 other students and four staff members.

Force was walking on a boardwalk in Jaffa Tuesday when a 22-year-old Palestinian terrorist stabbed him to death, part of a bloody, gruesome spree that saw Bashar Massalha stab 10 victims in three locations during a 20-minute attack. No one else from Vanderbilt was injured.

Taylor embarked on this trip to expand his understanding of global entrepreneurship and also to share his insights and knowledge with start-ups in Israel, Vanderbilt Chancellor Nicholas Zeppos wrote in a statement. He exemplified the spirit of discovery, learning and service that is a hallmark of our wonderful Owen [School of Business] community. This horrific act of violence has robbed our Vanderbilt family of a young hopeful life and all of the bright promise that he held for bettering our greater world.

Forces death will likely leave a void with those organizations he had so ably represented  Troop 505, West Point, Vanderbilt.

""Taylor was very loved, there was no -- there's not a better guy around than Taylor,"" Thompson said. ""Anybody that has met Taylor would know, your life was improved getting to know him.""",[]

Miguel Trujillo admitted he paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to secure media and marketing contracts.

Trujillo, a Colombia citizen and U.S. legal permanent resident, was freed on $1.5 million bail after his appearance before U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Dearie in Brooklyn.

The judge warned Trujillo that his plea to three conspiracy charges and a single count of filing a false tax return might force his deportation.

Dearie said prosecutors may choose to write a letter on his behalf urging leniency if he lives up to the terms of his plea agreement. Such a letter, he said, may influence how he sentences Trujillo on charges that otherwise could bring a prison term of up to 63 years.

Prosecutors said Trujillo has agreed to forfeit $495,000 after admitting to participating in multiple schemes to bribe soccer officials since 2008 while he was licensed by FIFA, the governing body of international soccer, to negotiate and arrange matches between FIFA member associations.

The government said Trujillo worked on behalf of multiple sports marketing companies and his own soccer business when he paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to bribe high-ranking officials of FIFA and four soccer federations in Central America and the Caribbean.

Trujillo said he worked with executives of a Miami-based sports marketing company, Media World, from 2008 to 2015 to pay the bribes to top officials.

He said he received wire transfers from the company's bank accounts in Miami into Panamanian accounts of companies he controlled before distributing the money to bank accounts at the direction of federation officials. He said he was paid money for his efforts by Media World, which is affiliated with Spanish media company Imagina Group.

""My co-conspirators in this scheme and I often used sham contracts and invoices in an effort to disguise the true nature of these transactions,"" Trujillo said. ""I knew that what I was doing was wrong.""

Ken Tolle, a Denver-based attorney with Imagina Group, said: ""I don't comment on client matters.""

The guilty plea came as part of an American prosecutors' probe into corruption in international soccer.

The charges against Trujillo, first unveiled publicly Tuesday, came in a branch of the FIFA probe that had already resulted in the arrests of 16 men, mostly from Central and South America. An indictment alleges that defendants accepted bribes and kickbacks related to lucrative broadcasting and hosting rights for the World Cup and other big soccer events.

U.S. prosecutors first announced the broader investigation in May with charges against 14 other individuals, including seven top FIFA officials arrested at a hotel in Zurich.

Several defendants have already pleaded guilty, including some not initially identified when charges were unveiled.

Trujillo's attorney declined to comment.

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Media warnings against Donald Trump shift from aggressive to apocalyptic,['Howard Kurtz'],"For all the talk of the Republican establishment trying to stop Donald Trump, it's the media establishment that is cranking up the volume to deafening levels.

Whats remarkable about this sustained assault is that it comes with equal force from the right and the left, united in their passion to stop the man who is winning the most Republican primary votes.

Presidential campaigns are rough, and opinion journalists often pound away at the candidates they dislike. These politicians get attacked on their record, background, temperament and for just about anything untoward theyve done since grade school.

But Ive never seen anything like this.

The tone of the media attacks over the last two weeks is apocalyptic, as if each commentator is undertaking a solemn mission to save the planet from an awful fate. Stop, they seem to be shouting, stop before it is too late!

Now theyre all entitled to speak out, based on their conscience. But the cumulative effect, combined with celebrities coming out of the woodwork to denounce Trump, carries a whiff of desperation.

Whats more, Trump has shown an uncanny ability to thrive on bad press, calling out journalists and casting himself as a crusader against media bias. The news business is a very popular target these days.

For liberal commentators who routinely strafe Republicans, Trump is a natural target. In the past, some have acted more bemused than appalled by The Donald, viewing him as destined to lose badly if he won the nomination. Now theyre not so sure he couldnt drive Hillary Clinton crazy and put some traditionally Democratic states in play, so the gloves are off.

For commentators on the right, Trump is viewed as a threat to conservatism and as engaging in a hostile hijacking of the Republican Party. Some are convinced that he would either lose in a landslide or ruin the GOPs brand.

Im offering excerpts here to highlight how these pundits are depicting Trump as not just a bad candidate but a threat to civilization.

Slate Editor-in-Chief Jacob Weisberg says that Trump, as a reality TV star and cyberbully on his third wife...is himself a good illustration of the breakdown of any moral order possibly remaining. He says Trump represents what autocratic attitudes look like in a modern American context. He is unfriendly toward the free market, the free press, and the free exercise of religion while paying lip service to these values. He is xenophobic, conspiratorial in his worldview, admiring of violence and torture, contemptuous of the weak, and unwilling to tolerate criticism or peaceful dissentbut all in the name of correcting excesses of tolerance.

The Washington Posts Ruth Marcus says that since she last wrote about him, Trump has proved himself to be even less knowledgeable and even more unhinged. His election would constitute a grave threat to American values and, potentially, American democracy...

Trump is Nixon with all of the megalomaniacal willingness to abuse power and none of the crafty realpolitik.

David Remnick, editor of the New Yorker, poses this question: How has Donald Trump, the coddled scion of a New York real-estate baron, emerged as a populist hero? How does the beneficiary of a draft deferment due to bone spurs on his feet get away with questioning the military record of John McCain, who endured five years as a prisoner of war? Trump believes that his appeal is based largely on what he calls his heroic lack of political correctness but which is more accurately described as a breezy penchant for race-baiting, war crimes, and content-free policy pronouncements.

Salon says that after watching Trump spewing hate, stoking xenophobia and attacking the Washington establishment  this thought keeps coming to mind: Is Donald Trump just David Duke in a better suit?

New York Times columnist David Brooks writes that now finally  at long last  major Republicans are raising their heads and highlighting Trumps actual vulnerability: his inability to think for an extended time about anybody but himself.

He seduces people with his confidence and his promises. People invest time, love and money in him. But in the end he cares only about himself. He betrays those who trust him and leaves them high and dry.

National Reviews Ian Tuttle challenges his credibility: Trump believes in nothing except the force of his own personality. Often, its not quite correct to say hes lying, because he never believed anything in the first place. Donald Trump is post-truth.

Another Times, columnist, Nick Kristof, views Trump as a bad dream: Is there any scarier nightmare than President Donald J. Trump in a tense international crisis, indignant and impatient, with his sweaty finger on the nuclear trigger? He adds: Ive never met a national politician so ill informed, so evasive, so bombastic and, frankly, so puerile.

And its not just the print people. CNN commentator Sally Kohn said the other day that the media are giving Trump too much attention, and when he institutes internment camps and suspends habeas [corpus], well all look back and feel pretty bad.

All this is unfolding in an environment in which many celebrities are also trashing Trump. Miley Cyrus and others have threatened to move to Canada if hes elected, and Louis C.K. said in a mass email:

Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the 30s...He is an insane bigot. He is dangerous.

Perhaps, if the noise level gets loud enough, it could sway some voters. But I think it underscores Trumps appeal, to his supporters at least, that powerful forces are aligned against himthe same forces that they blame for empty promises and economic anxiety.

If Trump keeps winning, these commentators are going to have to examine why he is connecting with the very voters who refuse to heed their ominous warnings.

SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket blasted off in a brilliant launch from Florida's Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida tonight, March 4, at 6:35 p.m. EST (2335 GMT). It's mission: Deliver the SES-9 commerical communications satellite into orbit for its Luxembourg-based customer SES. That part went fine, with the SES-9 satellite separating as planned from the Falcon 9 rocket and heading off toward its final orbit. The rocket landing, however, less so.

""Rocket landed hard on the droneship,"" SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wrote in a Twitter update. ""Didn't expect this one to work ([very] hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance.""

SpaceX tried to land the first stage of its Falcon 9 rocket on ""Of Course I Still Love You,"" one of two ""autonomous spaceport drone ships"" owned by the company, as part of a bold experiment for resuable rocket technology. The company publicly stated that the chances of success were slim, but it hoped to try anyway.

About 2.5 minutes after liftoff, the first stage of the Falcon 9 separated from its upper stage, then performed two engine burns to return Earth for a landing in the Atlantic Ocean a few hundred miles off the Florida coast. A video feed from the drone ship offered a tantalizing glimpse of what appeared to be the Falcon 9 approaching its landing zone before cutting out, apparently just before the booster hit the ship's deck. [See photos of the SpaceX rocket launch and landing try here]

On three previous occasions  in January 2015, April 2015 and January 2016  a Falcon 9 first stage had gotten this far during an ocean landing try. But all three times, the booster ended up toppling over on the ship's deck and exploding.

Just two months ago, in December 2015, SpaceX managed to land a Falcon 9 first stage on terra firma at Cape Canaveral, marking the first time this had ever been done during an orbital launch. (Blue Origin, the private spaceflight company established by Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, landed its New Shepard launch vehicle in November, but that milestone occurred during a suborbital test flight.)

All of this work is part of the company's effort to develop fully and rapidly reusable rockets  a key priority for SpaceX and its billionaire founder and CEO, Elon Musk. [Inside SpaceX's Epic Fly-Back Reusable Rocket Landing (Infographic)]

Musk has said repeatedly that he set up SpaceX primarily to help humanity colonize Mars, and he thinks reusable rockets are key to making that happen. The technology could slash the cost of spaceflight by a factor of 100, Musk has said.

The booster stage that landed in December survived its flight in good shape, and it performed well in engine tests after its recovery, SpaceX representatives said last month. That particular rocket stage will probably end up on display somewhere, but the company aims to refly other landed boosters in the future.

Noreen is disappointed in the turn of events and we are waiting for the doctors to come up with a new strategy. She hates to be confined to bed. Nurse Ratched is tough, and I am getting her to walk a little each day.

That's according to a PNAS study out of MIT concluding that a molecule in 640 million-year-old rocks came from the simple creature.

Assuming the researchers are right, that means the multi-celled organisms were around at least 100 million years before most animal groups blossomed during what's known as the Cambrian explosion, reports MIT News.

The few fossils from the pre-Cambrian era are difficult for paleontologists to evaluate, so researchers looked to molecule traces left behind in rocks by decaying creatures.

One molecule in particular, a modified version of cholesterol called 24-isopropylcholestane, kept cropping up, the same one produced by some sea sponges and algae today. Using what Discovery calls ""evolutionary-tree detective work,"" the researchers were able to rule out algae as the source.

We brought together paleontological and genetic evidence to make a pretty strong case that this really is a molecular fossil of sponges, says one of the scientists.

This is some of the oldest evidence for animal life. The find isn't so much a bombshell as further confirmation of a widely held theory that life originated with sea sponges.

And it opens the door to yet more questions about this earliest stage of animal life, including precisely what the organisms looked like and what kind of environment allowed them to thrive.

Another biggie as stated by the MIT researcher: ""Why is there this big gap in the fossil record?"" (Sea sponges may have helped create other animals.)

The full results from the nights four Republican primaries had not yet trickled in, but Rubio knew the results werent in his favor. And if the Florida senator was going to have any sliver of hope in winning the GOP nod he would need to pull off a surprise in his home state.

Rubio finished fourth-place in both Michigan and Mississippi, which only added to an ever widening delegate gap between him and front-runner Donald Trump.

I need your help, Rubio said, according the Politico. I believe with all my heart that the winner of the Florida primary next Tuesday will be the nominee of the Republican Party.

Analysts and observers say that one of Rubios main weaknesses in this campaign season is his lack of base support.

The Florida lawmaker has been touted as the most agreeable candidate for Republican voters and the best candidate to go head-to-head with prospective Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But as this 2016 presidential race has shown, core support  like Ted Cruz has with evangelical voters and Donald Trump has with disenfranchised working-class voters  has helped Rubios rivals carry most of the states.

Who has the biggest possibility of beating Hillary Clinton, all the strategists say that Marco has the best shot, Evelyn Perez-Verdia, an analyst with Political Pasion, told Fox News Latino. But at the end of the day hes going against a movement like we havent seen in the U.S. in Donald Trump.

Rubio, as the establishment candidate, said that instead of winning over a core support group, the candidate has instead cast a broad net in trying to win over everyone. To successfully do this a candidate must have a great deal of political dexterity.

Not only do you have to stay on message, you have to sustain multiple messages to multiple audiences, Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight wrote. It helps to have surrogates vouching for you to different constituencies, something Rubio didnt have a lot of until recently. And it helps to have enough media exposure to avoid being typecast in one role, something Rubio hasnt had all that much of in Trumps shadow.

There are others, however, who say that Rubio may have more of a base support than people claim  at least in the Sunshine State.

He has a big following from the conservative Cuban population because he was partially groomed by them, Perez-Verdia told FNL about Rubio. There are also some pockets that he is reaching out to that Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have not.

Perez-Verdia added that Rubio has made inroads with Floridas growing Colombian population thanks to his wifes roots and also with Venezuelan-Americans after speaking out harshly against the leftist government of President Nicolas Maduro.

One of Rubios two primary victories came in Puerto Rico. And Florida has seen its Puerto Rican population skyrocket in recent years as the islands economic woes continue.

Its still a longshot for Rubio  the latest Real Clear Politics average of polls from Florida have Trump holding an almost 17 point lead over his rival  but a late surge of campaigning and the support of Latinos, especially those disenfranchised with Trumps anti-immigrant rhetoric, could shift the state to Rubio.

You are given an incredible task a week from now, and I need your help, Rubio told his supporters. Go and vote now so you can spend the next six days finding other people to vote for me.

Now state health officials are investigating whether the milk was to blame for their fever, vomiting and diarrhea, and weighing allegations the raw-milk party broke the law.

So far, state and county health officials say they haven't received medical reports of illnesses related to the dangerous bacteria that can live in raw milk, which include Campylobacter, Listeria, Salmonella and E. Coli. The lawmaker involved, Del. Scott Cadle, who also stayed home sick on Monday, blames his and other illnesses on an unrelated stomach virus circulating the Capitol.

""Everybody up there is getting it,"" said Cadle, a Mason County Republican. ""It's a stomach virus. It didn't have nothing to do with that milk.""

Some of those who got sick, including House Speaker Tim Armstead, R-Kanawha, did not drink the milk, House spokesman Jared Hunt noted.

Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin signed a bill last Thursday that will let people share milk-producing animals and drink raw milk if people sign a document acknowledging the health risks, and if the animals have passed health tests within the previous year. The law, which takes effect in late May, maintains selling and distribution bans. Selling or even offering raw milk is illegal and still will be, subject to fines of $50 to $500, unless the new requirements are met.

Tomblin, a Democrat, vetoed a similar bill last year, saying raw milk contains bacteria particularly dangerous for children, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems.

State health officials got involved after someone filed a complaint Tuesday alleging that the distribution of raw milk in the halls of the Capitol violated the law, and could have been to blame for illnesses over the weekend. Officials don't release the names of people who file complaints.

It's not clear how many people got sick, or whether any of them were tested by doctors, who are required by law to report confirmed cases to the state health department.

State Health Officer Dr. Rahul Gupta his department investigates about 200 possible outbreaks of all kinds of illnesses every year, so this one isn't unusual, nor is it confirmed.

""It's important to note that a lot of the information out there is alleged,"" Gupta said. ""It's important to conduct an investigation to figure out exactly the facts.""

Cadle said he brought in raw milk last week and drank it with friends after the governor signed the bill into law.

""I might have been breaking the law,"" Cadle told the Charleston Gazette-Mail. ""Hell, I don't know. I gave it away.""",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,5 Things Your Accountant Wishes You Knew About Owning a Home,[],"What's not to love about tax season? The chill you get when you realize you owe the IRS thousands, the fear that you may be getting a bit too aggressive on your deductions, the fleeting hope you're due for a big return ... that's dashed when you end up with $2...

OK, so maybe only accountants love tax season. And here's another thing they love: wielding their vast knowledge of the tax code to help their clients save cash! Lots of it! If you own a home, there's plenty they can do to ease the burden of what you owe.

Of course, if you haven't hired an accountant to do your taxes already, you may not be able to talk to one until sometime after April 15, when they dig out from under their mountain of returns. Still, we know a few people, so we went ahead and nagged them for their prime pearls of wisdom. Check them out!

1. Having a home office does not automatically trigger an audit

Few things scare the pants off taxpayers (or accountants, for that matter) like the threat of an audit. Can you imagine pulling together all those receipts? As a result, many people avoid making claims on their taxes that they think will attract unwanted attention from the IRS. Among the most notorious of these supposed red flags is the home office deduction. Why tempt fate?

Yet accountants insist that having a home office does not automatically make you audit material. They also contend that avoiding this deduction, if you deserve it, is a huge mistake -- particularly since it allows you to also deduct portions of your utilities, maintenance, and other expenses, dramatically lowering your tax burden. In short, you could save big.

""What drives me crazy is when people don't take a home office deduction when it's so easy to do and when they are entitled to it,"" says Tom Wheelwright, a CPA and founder of ProVision Wealth Strategists.

To avoid missing out, know the rules. To determine if a home office is deductible, make sure it is an area of the home you exclusively use for business, and that it is your principal place of business (that means you don't have a second office supplied by your company). Note: In the eyes of the IRS, everything in a home office area needs to be justified as serving a business need. Ditch the PS2 and the lava lamps.

2. Moving is an overlooked money saver

Another easy tax break that homeowners often toss out the window is the cost of a job-related move.

""People never save the receipt,"" complains Craig McCullough, a Realtor and accountant in Washington, DC. And that's a missed opportunity, since moving fees can be hefty and are usually deductible.

A few caveats: You qualify only if you've moved more than 50 miles for your job (or to a new job) and work full-time for at least 39 weeks of the subsequent year. Plus, if your job pays for moving expenses, the reimbursed costs are not tax-deductible.

3. Selling a home too quickly comes at a price

Selling a house comes with its own set of pitfalls -- especially if you're doing so less than two years after purchase.

""You have to be really careful, because if you live in a house for less than two years that's appreciated in value, the profit of the sale is subject to capital gains taxes,"" McCullough says.

So, say you purchase a home in downtown Denver that appreciates nearly 20% over almost two years (totally possible, according to current home pricing trends). If you buy at $200,000 and sell at $240,000, you'll be subject to capital gains taxes on that $40,000.

""It's one of the biggest things sellers don't know about,"" he says. ""Sellers end up calling their brokerage really mad when they get their capital gains bill.""

4. Deducting your mortgage interest is really worth it

Odds are you've heard that you can deduct the interest you pay on your mortgage from your taxes. And maybe you've thought, ""Why bother? My interest is only 4%, which is a measly amount to deduct."" But here's what you're missing: For fixed-rate mortgages, the amount of money you pay per month may stay the same, but the proportion paid to interest changes a lot. In fact, in the early years of a mortgage, ""the bulk of that check goes toward interest,"" says Elmwood, WI, accountant Martha Hartung.

To find out how much of your mortgage payment is going toward interest, check your monthly statement for a breakdown. But whatever you do, don't assume it's too small to be worth mentioning on your taxes. And it's not just mortgage interest that can help you out come April: If you refinanced your home or received a home equity loan or line of credit, you can deduct interest on up to $100,000 of that debt.

5. Home improvements can lower your tax bill, too

If you've made any significant renovations to your home in the past year -- or plan to begin a new construction project -- make sure to keep an eye on any energy-efficient upgrades you make. You can get a tax credit for improvements such as energy-efficient windows, reflective roofs, and extra insulation, so be sure to talk to your tax accountant about them. While there is a $500 cap on the credit, keep in mind a tax credit directly reduces the amount you owe, compared with a deduction, which simply reduces your taxable income. So this is not something you want to pass up. Trust us.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Yellowstone bison sent to slaughter as park trims herd,[],"Yellowstone National Park started shipping many of its famous wild bison to slaughter Wednesday to drive down the size of the park's herds and respond to concerns by the livestock industry over a disease carried by the animals.

Thirty animals have been shipped to slaughterhouses, and officials plan to send an additional 120 in the next few days. The bison were weighed and tested for disease for research purposes, and the remaining animals were crowded into holding pens to await shipment.

The park's actions are driven by an agreement in 2000 with Montana officials that requires it to control its bison herds. The meat will be distributed to American Indian tribes that traditionally subsisted on bison.

""Nobody here wants to be doing this,"" park spokeswoman Jody Lyle said after the bison were prodded into trailers for shipment. ""It's time for a change.""

About 150 of the animals have been captured this winter trying to migrate out of the park in search of food at lower elevations in Montana. Ranchers worry about bison infected with brucellosis, a disease that can cause cattle to abort their young.

There have been no recorded bison-to-cattle transmissions of brucellosis, and critics say the slaughters are unnecessary. Captured bison that test negative for it are not spared.

""This is not OK. It's really that simple,"" said Stephany Seay with the Buffalo Field Campaign, a bison advocacy group.

Rick Lamplugh said he moved last May from Oregon to the small town of Gardiner, at the northern entrance to the park, in large part for the wildlife viewing opportunities. The park and state agencies need rethink their policies on bison so they can be ""treated like any other wildlife,"" he said.

Tens of millions of bison, also known as buffalo, once roamed North America. Commercial hunting drove the species to near-extinction in the late 1800s before conservationists  including former President Theodore Roosevelt  intervened when only dozens were left.

Yellowstone is home to one of the few remaining wild populations. Millions of tourists visit the park each year to see the animals, a top attraction at the nation's first national park. The animals also are the symbol of the National Park Service.

Since the 1980s, worry over brucellosis has prompted the killing of about 8,200 park bison, most of them sent to slaughter. In recent years, state, federal and tribal agencies have tried to emphasize public hunts that occur just outside the park's boundaries.

Hunters so far this winter have killed more than 400 of the animals, said Andrea Jones with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. That's the most since 1989. The vast majority were shot by members of American Indian tribes that have treaty hunting rights in the Yellowstone region.

Detracting from the hunt's success has been an unprecedented number of animals that were merely wounded and retreated to the park after being shot.

Up to 50 wounded bison were killed by state and federal wildlife agents, Jones said.

The park had 4,900 bison at last count, well above the 3,000 dictated under the agreement. Park officials set a goal this year of removing 600 to 900 of the animals. More shipments to slaughter are possible in coming weeks if large groups of bison move into Montana, although a mild winter has reduced this year's migration compared with previous years.

During the past decade, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and his predecessor moved to allow bison into areas adjacent to the park. Yellowstone administrators have supported those efforts, but they say they are bound under the 2000 agreement to keep the bison herds in check.

Alternatives  such as transferring some Yellowstone bison to lands outside the park  are under consideration but unlikely to take effect soon. Park workers are holding back from slaughter about two dozen bison calves for potential future placement elsewhere if the opportunity arises, park spokeswoman Amy Bartlett said.

If that doesn't happen, the animals will be slaughtered, she said.",[]

worlds biggest ocean-dwelling crocodile buried on the edge of the Sahara, a creature that was twice the size of anything seen today.

Named Machimosaurus rex, this croc would have weighed in at

least 6,600 pounds and been around 32 feet long. Other than its size, it would have looked much like a modern day crocodile except for its narrow snout  which was designed to allow it swim in the ocean.

It would have been the top predator in what was then an

This is an incredibly big crocodile. It is twice as big as

a present day marine crocodile, University of Bolognas Federico Fanti, who was part of the team that made the discovery with support from the National Geographic Society Committee for Research and Exploration, told FoxNews.com.

The skull itself is as big I am, said Fanti, whose

discovery was detailed in a study in the journal Cretaceous Research. Just the skull is more than five feet long.

Its a massive crocodile.

Tunisia, where the skeleton and some bones were found, would have been a

lagoon facing the ocean and the environment would have been filled with huge fish and turtles  all favorite prey of the Machimosaurus rex.

This animal, however, used to feast on the large turtles or

big fishes that it found in the ocean, Fanti said. He was so big and so powerful that it was absolutely at the top of the food chain.

Beyond its size, Fanti said the significance of the find is

what it tells us about a mass extinction event that is believed to have happened between the Jurassic and Cretaceous period about 150 million years ago. Machimosaurus

rex was thought to have died out then but the discovery suggests the extinction event was not as widespread as some paleontologist thought.

Related: 20-Foot Fanged, Galloping Ancient Croc Fossils Found

The fact that Machimosaurus rex (pertaining to a group that

was well alive in the Jurassic) lived 130-120 million years ago indicate that there was no mass extinction, Fanti said.

Everyone thought this group of crocodiles went extinct in

the Jurassic but we found it well into the Cretaceous, he said. We simply extended the temporal range of the animals. Twenty million years is a lot of time.

Fanti, whose team has discovered 20 new species including a rebbachisaurid sauropod Tataouinea hannibalis in the same area, said there is less to learn about crocodile evolution from this new discovery. The reason, he said, is that crocodiles have changed little over time.

Basically, they are bigger or smaller, he said of their

evolution, adding that even bigger crocodiles lived on land, many of which also have gone extinct. The largest freshwater crocodile, Sarcosuchus imperator, lived 110 million years ago and grew as long as 40 feet (12 meters). It weighed

up to 17,500 pounds, according to National Geographic.",[]

The state requires 490 days of schooling to become a licensed cosmetologist. Students have to learn how to apply makeup, style and color hair and must pass a licensing exam to become a licensed cosmetologist.

Hair-braiding is barely taught in most cosmetology schools, but anyone wanting to make a few dollars by braiding hair  a practice most common in African-American communities, where traditional hair-braiding has been taught for centuries  has to go through the cosmetology licensing process.

Those 2,100 hours of training can cost as much as $20,000 in tuition and fees. Getting licensed also requires a high school diploma or GED, as if passing algebra was essential to understanding how to braid hair.

To put it simply, this is ridiculous, said Jessica Herrmann, director of legislative outreach for the Platte Institute of Economic Research. Hair braiders must not only obtain permission from the government, but also spend thousands of dollars on course instruction on coloring, men and womens cutting, waxing, home creative skills, skin and spa services and chemistry. This burdensome regulation creates a huge financial barrier to entry for this new class of entrepreneurs.

But skipping that lengthy and expensive process means facing the potential penalties for being an unlicensed cosmetologist. Those include fines of up to $25,000 and the potential of four years in prison.

The North's Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried photos on its front page showing Kim and nuclear scientists standing beside what outside analysts say appears to be a model warhead part -- a small, silverish globe with a ballistic missile or a model ballistic missile in the background.

The newspaper said Kim met his nuclear scientists for a briefing on the status of their work and declared he was greatly pleased that warheads had been standardized and miniaturized for use on ballistic missiles.

Information from secretive, authoritarian North Korea is often impossible to confirm and the country's state media have a history of photo manipulations. But it was the first time the North has publicly displayed its purported nuclear designs, though it remains unclear whether the country has functioning warheads of that size or is simply trying to develop one.

This also would be the first time Kim has been quoted directly about the miniaturized warheads.

""The nuclear warheads have been standardized to be fit for ballistic missiles by miniaturizing them,"" state media agency KCNA quoted Kim as saying as he inspected a nuclear facility.

""This can be called true nuclear deterrent,"" he added.

The latest developments from the reclusive country come amid heightened tensions following claims it tested a hydrogen bomb in January.

On Monday at State of Air Force briefing at Pentagon, the Air Force's top officer Gen. Mark Welsh told Fox News, that while the actions of North Korea are ""very worrisome,"" the country does not have the capability to put a nuclear warhead on top of a missile and shoot it at the United States.

North Korea warned Monday of pre-emptive nuclear strikes after the United States and South Korea began holding their biggest ever war games.

Tensions remain high after North Korea's recent nuclear test and rocket launch, which prompted the United Nations to adopt tough new sanctions.

The vast majority of the 2,000 Syrians who, according to official data, came to Brazil in recent years have ended up selling food in the streets, one of the few jobs not made impossible by the barrier of the Portuguese language.

Street vendors of Arab food have multiplied in recent months in big cities like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, where cuisine of this kind is very popular due to the influence of Lebanese immigrants.

Refugee Mohamed Ali Abd el-Moatty Kenawy told EFE he has been trying to get a street vendor's license for three months in Rio, so while waiting for an answer from City Hall, he started preparing and selling Arab food on a quiet corner of the Copacabana neighborhood.

He chose a place where he wouldn't be noticed and far from the beach at Copacabana, the favorite of tourists in Rio, to avoid being spotted by municipal guards, who have already confiscated the food from some of his colleagues.

According to this refugee, another 20 Syrians are in the same situation of waiting for a municipal permit, but to get it, they have to follow the same steps Brazilians do and remain for what could be several years on a waiting list, particularly in the tourist areas of Rio where the demand is greatest.

Some 188 Syrians have sought asylum in Rio de Janeiro since 2014, according to figures of the Catholic NGO Caritas, most of them dedicated to selling food in the streets, though a few have managed to find jobs in restaurants while another three will start giving classes in Arabic this month as part of a project being promoted by the NGO.

Bernie Sanders pulled off a shocking upset Tuesday night, beating Hillary Clinton in the Michigan Democratic primary  where some polls going into the race had him trailing by double-digits  and wiping out Clinton's win earlier in the night in Mississippi.

Republican front-runner Donald Trump, meanwhile, regained any momentum lost last weekend against Ted Cruz, sweeping to convincing victories in Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii, sending a message to the Republican establishment to jump on board  or get out of the way.

Fox News projects Cruz will win the Idaho GOP primary, with Trump placing second there.

But Trump's victories were more valuable in terms of delegates. And the results Tuesday also may help shape the fate of Marco Rubio, who appeared once again to finish the night failing to gain any delegates.

Cruz and John Kasich, meanwhile, were locked in a dogfight for second place in Michigan, the neighboring state to Ohio, where Kasich is counting on a win next week to salvage his campaign.

On the Democratic side, Clinton easily won Mississippis primary earlier Tuesday, thanks in part to her overwhelming support from black voters, and likely will pick up more delegates in Tuesdays contests than Sanders.

But the Vermont senators surprising Michigan win could give him a bounce as he and the rest of the candidates charge into the vital March 15 primaries in Florida, Ohio and three other big states. All 15 pre-election polls in Michigan this year showed Clinton leading Sanders by double-digits.

This is now the ninth and largest state that Sanders has won so far in the Democratic presidential campaign.

Sanders chief strategist John Weaver blasted out a memo touting the Michigan performance, saying the state provides a springboard into the races on March 15, the day the race will officially reset.""

For his part, Trump is looking to March 15 to sideline the rest of the GOP field for good  something he tried to start doing Tuesday night. At a press conference at his golf club in Juniper, Fla., he said of his remaining rivals, Theyre pretty much all gone.

Michigan was the biggest prize on the map Tuesday, with four states in total voting.

On the Republican side in Mississippi, Trump's projected victory leaves Cruz to finish in second place. Kasich and Rubio are locked in a battle for third.

Now state health officials are investigating whether the milk was to blame for their fever, vomiting and diarrhea, and weighing allegations the raw-milk party broke the law.

So far, state and county health officials say they haven't received medical reports of illnesses related to the dangerous bacteria that can live in raw milk, which include Campylobacter, Listeria, Salmonella and E. Coli. The lawmaker involved, Del. Scott Cadle, who also stayed home sick on Monday, blames his and other illnesses on an unrelated stomach virus circulating the Capitol.

""Everybody up there is getting it,"" said Cadle, a Mason County Republican. ""It's a stomach virus. It didn't have nothing to do with that milk.""

Some of those who got sick, including House Speaker Tim Armstead, R-Kanawha, did not drink the milk, House spokesman Jared Hunt noted.

Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin signed a bill last Thursday that will let people share milk-producing animals and drink raw milk if people sign a document acknowledging the health risks, and if the animals have passed health tests within the previous year. The law, which takes effect in late May, maintains selling and distribution bans. Selling or even offering raw milk is illegal and still will be, subject to fines of $50 to $500, unless the new requirements are met.

Tomblin, a Democrat, vetoed a similar bill last year, saying raw milk contains bacteria particularly dangerous for children, pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems.

State health officials got involved after someone filed a complaint Tuesday alleging that the distribution of raw milk in the halls of the Capitol violated the law, and could have been to blame for illnesses over the weekend. Officials don't release the names of people who file complaints.

It's not clear how many people got sick, or whether any of them were tested by doctors, who are required by law to report confirmed cases to the state health department.

State Health Officer Dr. Rahul Gupta his department investigates about 200 possible outbreaks of all kinds of illnesses every year, so this one isn't unusual, nor is it confirmed.

""It's important to note that a lot of the information out there is alleged,"" Gupta said. ""It's important to conduct an investigation to figure out exactly the facts.""

Cadle said he brought in raw milk last week and drank it with friends after the governor signed the bill into law.

""I might have been breaking the law,"" Cadle told the Charleston Gazette-Mail. ""Hell, I don't know. I gave it away.""",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Obama makes rare endorsement via ad in Illinois House primary,[],"President Obama has taken the rare step of inserting himself into a local legislative contest in Illinois, cutting an ad for a challenger who is competing against an incumbent Democrat known for siding at times with Republicans.

In a 30-second television ad, Obama says hes learned from his days in the state legislature that follow-through is everything and therefore is throwing his political weight and endorsement behind Juliana Stratton over Rep. Ken Dunkin of Chicago.

Obama says hes backing Stratton because she will stand up for our children, our seniors and our working families. He says Stratton will fight for gun control and tougher penalties for violent offenders.

But there likely are other factors at play, in what is shaping up as one of the nastiest and toughest political battles in Illinois.

Dunkin has sided with Republicans during key votes -- denying House Speaker Michael Madigan what would otherwise be a 71-vote veto-proof majority -- and has received campaign contributions from allies of Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner.

Stratton, by contrast, is backed by unions and has picked up the support of almost all the other prominent Democrats in the state.

There has been bad blood between Obama and Dunkin for years.

During a February visit to Springfield, Ill., Obama riled up the lawmaker when he said reaching across the aisle for the sake of compromise doesnt make me a sellout to my own party.

Dunkin jumped out of his seat and interrupted the president by shouting Yes!

Obama snapped back, Well talk later Dunkin. Sit down.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel told WLS-AM News that Obamas endorsement is about getting lawmakers to work together and end the Illinois budget deadlock.

Its not a political endorsement. Its an endorsement to move forward and finally get the city and the state, most importantly, moving forward, he said.

On Monday, Sally Daly, a spokeswoman for Cook Countys States Attorney Anita Alvarez, said her office is looking into a complaint against Dunkin that alleges his office paid voters.

A spokesman for Dunkin told the Chicago Tribune the accusations are baseless.

While a rarity, Obama has endorsed other local candidates in the past. In 2014, he announced his endorsement of now-D.C. Mayor Muriel Bower. Obamas endorsements of Bill de Blasio of New York, Annise Parker of Houston and Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans may have helped all three clinch victories.",[]

While they are in different parts of the world, both men are motivated by the same desire  to catch a glimpse of Tuesdays solar eclipse.

It is set to occur from 8:38 p.m. to 8:42 p.m. A total eclipse will witnessed in parts of Southeast Asia including Indonesia and the Pacific Ocean and a partial eclipse upwards of 70 percent will be visible in parts of Alaska, Hawaii, Guam, and America Samoa.

Each time is like going to the seventh game of the World Series with the score tied in the ninth inning, said Pasachoff, the chairman of the International Astronomical Union Working Group on Solar Eclipses who was leading a tour group that will watch the eclipse from the island of Ternate, an island where Wallace penned his famous 1858 essay on evolution by natural selection.

Much of the excitement around the eclipse is in Indonesia, where many islands will go dark. Hotels have been booked since 2014, eclipse watchers Sam Huang, and local festivals are being organized across the sprawling island nation to celebrate the occasion.

I look forward to watching the moon slowly cover the sun and seeing the sky grow darker and darker until I am able to see the stars and planets, Huang, who is traveling to the island of Palu from the Philippines to watch the eclipse, told FoxNews.com. I've heard its almost a supernatural experience, and of course hearing the reactions of everyone around me will be fun to experience.

Kentrianakis, who is the solar eclipse project manager for the American Astronomical Society, has booked seat 6F on Alaska Airlines Flight 870 to watch the solar eclipse at about 36,000 feet. After hearing from intrepid eclipse-chaser Joseph Rao last fall that flight 870 would be in the right place at the wrong time for the eclipse, the airline said it agreed to reschedule the flight so it would depart 25 minutes later.

I must say being a veteran eclipse chaser I'm a little nervous about this one. Why? I've never viewed a total solar eclipse from an airplane, said Kentrianakis, who says he and his fellow passenger will be the only Americans not leaving the United States to view the eclipse.

Having seen nine total solar eclipses on the ground all across the world, I don't know what to expect, he told FoxNews.com. From what I hear it's quite spectacular seeing the entire shadow of the Moon sweep across the skyscape and envelope the plane into darkness. I can't imagine it getting more dramatic than that.

And if you can't see the eclipse first hand, there will be plenty of options to see it live on the web. NASA TV will broadcast it live while the Slooh Community Observatory is streaming the eclipse.



An eclipse occurs when the moon passes directly between Earth and the sun.

When the moon's shadow falls on Earth, observers within that shadow see the moon block a portion of the sun's light. During totality, the sun appears to have a wispy white halo, offering ground observers a rare direct view of its atmosphere or corona, normally kept out of sight by the intense brightness of the solar disc.

This one is considered especially significant because it is lasting for several minutes. Eclipse range from zero to seven minutes and the next one, which takes place across the United States on Aug. 21, 2017, is expected to last about 2 minutes and 41 seconds.

For scientists like Pasachoff, a total eclipse offers a rare chance to directly observe the interactions between different layers of the sun's atmosphere, known as the photosphere, chromosphere and the solar corona.

Its shape changes all the time so we only get these high resolution glimpses for two or three minutes every year or two, Pasachoff said of the corona.

If you were a heart surgeon and somebody told you that you had to go to Indonesia to look into a human heart for two minutes and then somebody told you two years later you had to go Africa for another two minutes, there would be no question, he said. You wouldnt be asking why bother going back.

An eclipse also gives scientists the opportunity to study coronal mass ejections, where bubbles of gas burst forth from the sun's corona and sometimes head to Earth. In the worst case scenarios, they can spark solar storms which can knock out communication networks and disable satellites.

Every eclipse is different because the Sun goes through an 11 year sunspot cycle and there are big eruptions that come out of the sun  some of which hit the earth and can zap billion dollar satellites, Pasachoff said, who will be observing this eclipse with a series of telephoto lens and a small telescope. We want to know about these eruptions and how fast they go and how to predict them.",[]

At issue are tracking cookies intended to serve up relevant ads. Verizon inserts these identifiers, known as UIDH, into Web traffic to identify customers and ultimately deliver them targeted ads. Researchers, however, found that Verizon partners could track users even if they deleted their cookies.

As a result of the investigation and settlement, ""Verizon Wireless is notifying consumers about its targeted advertising programs, will obtain customers' opt-in consent before sharing UIDH with third parties, and will obtain customers' opt-in or opt-out consent before sharing UIDH internally within the Verizon corporate family,"" the FCC says.

The FCC probe dates back to December 2014, when the agency launched an investigation into whether Verizon's practice violated the FCC's Open Internet Transparency Rule and the Communications Act. The investigation found that Verizon began inserting these identifiers into customers' Internet traffic as early as December 2012, but failed to inform customers about the practice until October 2014.

Last year, Verizon said it would let users opt out of being tracked by these super cookies. According to The Verge, the settlement means those who don't opt out will also get to ""limit who gets to see their information.""

""Consumers care about privacy and should have a say in how their personal information is used, especially when it comes to who knows what they're doing online,"" FCC Enforcement Bureau Chief Travis LeBlanc said in a statement. ""Privacy and innovation are not incompatible. This agreement shows that companies can offer meaningful transparency and consumer choice while at the same time continuing to innovate.""

By Ruth Marcus, The Washington Post

For those of you salivating  or trembling  at the thought of Hillary Clinton being clapped in handcuffs as she prepares to deliver her acceptance speech at the Democratic convention this summer: deep, cleansing breath. Based on the available facts and the relevant precedents, criminal prosecution of Clinton for mishandling classified information in her emails is extraordinarily unlikely.

My exasperation with Clintons use of a private email server while secretary of state is long-standing and unabated. Lucky for her, political idiocy is not criminal.

There are plenty of unattractive facts but not a lot of clear evidence of criminality, and we tend to forget the distinction, American University law professor Stephen Vladeck, an expert on prosecutions involving classified information, told me.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Saving Yazidis from ISIS, one captive at a time",['Hollie Mckay'],"Nearly 2,400 Yazidi men, women and children have been ransomed, rescued or lucky enough to escape the clutches of ISIS, according to new figures from a Kurdish government bureau that works closely with the minority Iraqi religious community.

The Yazidi community, with the protection of the Kurdish Regional Government and funding from around the world, has formed an extensive international network to save their women from sexual slavery and men from serving in the black-clad jihadist army.

The younger and more beautiful she is and the less number of children she has  if any  will make her more expensive. - Abu Shujaa

There are several ways, Abu Shujaa, who established a volunteer group with safe houses and has managed an underground rescue railroad to liberate hundreds of Yazidis since the ISIS onslaught in his hometown of Sinjar, told FoxNews.com. Sometimes the girls access phones and contact family members or friends and they get directed to us.

Other times, volunteers investigate and locate where the girls were taken, and when they find out they then reach out to them and arrange the escape, he added. There are other ways too, but we cant reveal yet as there are a whole lot of girls left we have to rescue.

The Kurdistan Regional Governments Office of the Prime Minister has a special bureau dedicated to observing the rescue of Yazidi victims. Although it plays no role in negotiating with captors, in cases in which family members pay ransom, the office reimburses them.

Of an estimated 4,029 Yazidi women and girls abducted over the last three years, some 1,456 have been rescued, according to statistics from the Kurdish government, which works with the Yazidi community.

While women are held by ISIS for sex, men are captured and forced into the terrorist army. Some 3,403 men and boys have been captured, with just more than 900 making it back to their families. In total, some 1,293 Yazidis have been killed by ISIS, many of them among the men and boys taken and given the choice of joining ISIS or being killed. Another 460 remain unaccounted for.

The tight-knit community, which is concentrated along the nations northern Ninevah Plain, has endured horrific suffering since the rise of ISIS. Of a population estimated at 550,000 before the terrorist army began its ethnic and religious cleansing campaign, some 400,000 have been displaced according to the directorate.

While entering ISIS-held territory could mean death for Yazidis, they have a network of civilian women trapped inside Mosul and other places within the so-called caliphate who want to do something good for humanity and help, according to Shujaa.

With help from their Kurdish allies, as well as Muslim sympathizers, Yazidis have pulled together to deliver their women and girls from the misery inflicted by ISIS. The Yazidi religion includes elements of ancient nature-worship, as well as influences from Christianity, Gnosticism, Zoroastrianism, Islam and Judaism, and ISIS justifies its slavery and slaughter under the guise that Yazidis are devil worshippers.

By enslaving women, ISIS is effectively cleansing the lands of Yazidi and other minority groups of their ethnic identity, said Daniel Sullivan, director of policy and government relations at the Washington-based nonprofit United to End Genocide.

Rescue typically involves several intermediaries carrying out a series of steps such as smuggling cellphones and counterfeit IDs into the places where the girls are being held, establishing a network of safe houses and long journeys on foot under cover of darkness.

The process has been managed and supervised by the family of the victims themselves, said Yakhi Balak, who heads a Yazidi task force that works with the Kurdistan Regional Government to facilitate and track rescue operations. The family coordinates with their religious leaders with the moral support of local Yazidi communities.

Each successful rescue has its own dramatic and harrowing tale. The family of one girl told FoxNews.com their daughter was granted permission to use her captors phone and was able to alert outsiders with a rough description of her location. That allowed Yazidi activists to put a plan into place, working with contacts inside Mosul. Another girl told of escaping through a broken window when her captor was not at home. She hid in a sympathetic familys home until smugglers could reach her.

Such escapes are the exception, not the rule. Most Yazidis who have made it out of ISIS captivity owe their freedom to ransom paid by loved ones and with funds raised by international charities. Fees for buying back a Yazidi captive vary wildly  as do the prices wealthy Arabs and ISIS fighters pay for them at stomach-turning auctions held in public squares.

The younger and more beautiful she is and the less number of children she has  if any  will make her more expensive, Shujaa said. Every girl comes back with a unique story that is very powerful and emotional. Some of them as young as 8 are being raped and enslaved. A few days ago, a beautiful 11-year-old girl was sold at the market in Raqqa for the equivalent of $20,000.

Ransom fees generally must cover whatever the slave buyer paid, plus a profit and, in most cases, a cut for Sunni tribesmen who often facilitate negotiations. Just over a year ago, a Yazidi family could buy back a daughter for as little as $300. Now, the price can top $13,000, according to Yazidi officials.

In many cases the local wealthy Arab residents were among the buyers of sex slaves, Balak said. Different prices were paid at the time of purchase and in some cases slaves were sold for a profit. Buy back prices were usually higher than slave market price.

Many Yazidi families have scraped together the money needed for a loved ones safe return only to find out theyve been tricked, an Iraqi with close ties to the government in Baghdad said.

The scammers are everywhere, he said. They are in Iraq and they are outside of Iraq. Its terrible.

Rescue groups have raised funds in North America, including through GoFundMe.com. The efforts have raised alarms in some quarters, both that donors could be getting scammed and also that, even if the funds go to ransom, the process makes captives more valuable and the money ends up in the hands of ISIS.

The lack of monitoring on the ground means Western governments must clamp down on funds headed for the caliphate, even if intentions are good, said Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, director of Israel Law Center, which focuses on blocking funding to terror groups.

A representative for crowd-funding platform GoFundMe told FoxNews.com that red flags have indeed been raised as to whether campaigns of this nature have directed funds to ISIS in order to secure the release of hostages, and that they have referred matters to the Office of Foreign Assets Control with concerns over violations of U.S. sanctions.

A spokesperson for the U.S Department of the Treasury responded that online donations are not a significant contributor to ISILs wealth.

Rather, it remains the case that ISIL has generated the vast majority of its funds through oil and gas, extortion, and looting banks in the regions that it controls, the spokesperson said.

Liberating a young girl from the clutches of ISIS is worth whatever a heartsick parent  or a determined community  can afford, said Balak.

However, other than some sort of cash exchange there are seemingly few other options to bring back the innocent victims.

Looking at the greater human tragic picture, rescuing a human being in the hands of savages should not be counted toward terrorism funding, Balak added.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,'He has fought: Fiorina endorses Cruz in Florida,[],"Former 2016 GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina resurfaced on the campaign trail Wednesday to endorse Ted Cruz, touting the Texas senators conservative credentials and arguing hes the only GOP candidate who can beat primary front-runner Donald Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton.

He has fought for our religious liberty. He has fought for our sovereignty, Fiorina said, before introducing Cruz at a campaign rally in Miami.

Fiorina, who dropped out of the 2016 race in February, called Cruz a leader and a reformer and took some shots at the primary front-runner in the process.

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin. Theyre not going to reform the system. They are the system, she said.

Her endorsement comes after Cruz walked away from Tuesdays primary contests with just one win, in Idaho, compared with Trumps three. The billionaire businessman won in Mississippi, Michigan and Hawaii, building his already substantial delegate lead over the field.

Florida, where Fiorina spoke, is among the five states set to vote next Tuesday and is one of the biggest battlegrounds.

Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive officer, said the argument that Cruz has made too many enemies on Capitol Hill only proves he is taking on the Washington cartel.

You have a very important job on Tuesday, said Fiorina, referring to Floridas primary, where Cruz is running behind Trump. Its time to take the party back. Its time to take our government back. Its time to take the country back. So its time to unite behind the only one who can, Ted Cruz.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Some seek alternatives to pets' post-surgery 'cone of shame',[],"Call it the cone of shame. Radar dish. Elizabethan collar.

Whatever its name, pets seem to hate the stiff, lampshade-like piece of plastic that vets often put around their necks to keep them from biting or chewing wounds, stitches or other problem areas.

""She was not a happy camper. She couldn't eat in it, she couldn't play in it, she couldn't move around in it,"" Brooke Yoder of Millersburg, Ohio, said about her Maltese-Shih Tzu dog, Marley, who got a cone to protect her stitches after she was spayed.

The first cones were handmade by pharmaceutical salesman Edward J. Schilling in the early 1960s, and they remain the best-selling wound or suture protection on the market for pets, said Ken Bowman, president of the Chino, California-based KVP International, a cone manufacturer.

Yet his company and others are trying to come up with something better.

KVP makes recovery collars in 14 styles, including two inflatables and two soft collars. They have cones to fit pets from mice to mastiffs.

The company is running studies on whether the cone acts like an amplifier, potentially hurting an animal's ears, and whether the loss of vision it causes can create stress.

One alternative has come from Stephanie Syberg of St. Peters, Missouri, founder and president of Cover Me by Tui, which makes a one-piece, post-surgical garment for dogs.

""I was in veterinary medicine myself for 16 years. I was constantly being asked, 'What can we use instead of the plastic cone?'"" Syberg said.

Her onesie, made of Peruvian cotton, was tested on 200 dogs. ""Vets are seeing the calming effect,"" she said. ""The fabric is breathable so it promotes healing.""

She sells pullover and step-in versions at TulanesCloset.com.

Dr. Charlie Sink, who runs the Grand Paws Animal Clinic in Surprise, Arizona, bought 3,000 of them on his first order.

""They are the softest cloth and the dogs just love them. You can wash them. It's an amazing product,"" said Sink, who has been a vet for 47 years.

But there are times, he said, when only the hard cone will work: if the dog's injury is on a body part not covered by the onesie, for instance.

Gayle Swetow of Henderson, Nevada, has become a regular customer of Syberg's. She was told to put a cone on her 2-year-old pit-bull mix to protect a 6-inch incision after he had surgery on his hip.

""I slept with him every night downstairs because I couldn't bear to put a cone on him,"" she said. ""That didn't work so I started frantically looking up dog onesies or dog pajamas.""

""I think I've bought 10 of them already because the dog has an allergy too. I keep him in this every day,"" Swetow said.

The cones, she continued, are ""awful. The dogs can't see where they are going. They can't jump up. Eating, moving or walking is nearly impossible with a cone. But they can do anything and everything if they have a onesie on.""

The cone's unpopularity has also led to some creative alternatives by designers and artists at the website More Than a Cone (www.morethanacone.com ).

In addition to making the cone more attractive, Bowman said, efforts are under way to make it more comfortable and effective too.",[]

The first official day of spring is March 20, so usher in the new season with a bit of spring cleaning, fresh flowers and  if you can get outdoors  a little dirt under your fingernails.

Plant a tree. Spring and fall are the best times to plant trees because wet weather and cooler temperatures make it easier for root systems to get established. Be sure to check with your local nursery to determine which species will do best in your microclimate and to get detailed planting instructions. If your area has a late date of last frost, you may need to wait until all threat of it has passed before planting.

Inspect your homes exterior. Once winter storms have passed, carefully inspect the exterior of your home for damage. If you had an ice dam on your roof during the winter, now is the time to repair any damage it caused, and make changes to your roof to prevent ice dams in the future.

Simplify the table. Cupboards feeling overstuffed? Simplify your life by paring back on dishes and glassware, letting go of mismatched and chipped pieces and sets you no longer love or use often. Keep a basket of fresh cloth napkins within easy reach of the table to make it more convenient than grabbing paper napkins, and invest in a living centerpiece (potted succulents work well) that will stay fresh and green with little maintenance.

Spring-clean the kitchen. Give your kitchen a fresh start by cleaning some of the areas we often skip during quicker daily cleanup sessions: Clean small appliances; wipe grease and grime from the range hood, backsplash and light fixtures; clean grout; and vacuum hard-to-reach places (like under the stove) using an attachment.

How to Clean Your Fridge

Clean slipcovers and soft furnishings. Smaller slipcovers and washable rugs can be laundered at home; drop off larger pieces with professionals. When laundering items at home, be sure to check the instructions carefully and err on the side of caution. Most items like curtains and slipcovers can be put back while damp  for the best fit and to prevent wrinkles.

Get ready for tax time. Tax deadline isnt until April 18, but getting your ducks in a row this month will make things a lot less stressful. Sort through paperwork, update your files and gather all important documents in one place so youre ready to go.

Treat yourself to spring blooms. Spring flowers such as daffodils are plentiful and inexpensive this month, so keep an eye out for bargains. And if you have blooms popping up in the garden, why not snip a few to enjoy indoors?

Make a garden plan. Theres still time to get your garden growing! Sketch out a plan and jot down ideas for this years plantings, as well as any ideas you have for changes to the hardscape, like putting in a new path or fence. Start some seeds indoors, or pick up seedlings at your local nursery. Check botanical gardens for spring plant sales too, as these can be great places to find native plants that do especially well in your region.

Tidy the entryway. Put away any lingering mittens and wool hats and make room for those mucky spring boots. A clean boot tray lined in river stones will help water drain away from your footwear. Clear off the hooks (or hangers, if you have a coat closet) and be sure to put out an umbrella holder stocked for spring showers.

Add Storage to Your Entry With a New Console Table

Clean up patio furniture. Outdoor furniture can get really grimy over the winter, so be sure to give everything a good scrubbing before you start using it for the season. Launder washable outdoor cushion covers, and replace worn-out pieces if needed.

Tune up lawn and garden tools. Sharp tools get the job done. Take your lawn mower and clippers in for a sharpening and tuneup before you begin work in your garden.

DEAR REPUBLICANS, IT'S TED CRUZ

What is the rationale for Marco Rubios candidacy?

The latest poll out from the classiest and most reliable Florida pollster, Quinnipiac University, says there is none.



After a week of disappointing elections for Rubio, the Florida Q Poll is the dagger to the heart of his presidential aspirations. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush can be happy that while his own bid failed, at least he killed the one his campaign staff called ""Judas."" Enjoy Fisher Island.



The poll shows frontrunner Donald Trump doubling up Florida freshman Rubio with less than a week to go before the winner-take-all contest for 99 delegates. Coming after a disastrous election night it should be enough to send Rubio packing.



The only argument for Rubios continued candidacy was the Romney Plan in which voters should support any candidate in any race that can beat Donald Trump or deny him delegates. It worked pretty well in Michigan where Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich soaked up the majority of delegates with their tie for second place behind Trump.



But there is no hope that Rubio can be the guy to stop Trump in Florida anymore. While Republicans have resisted Cruz, despite his repeated successes, it may be time for the party to admit that Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is quite right: Cruz is the only candidate who has any shot of denying Trump the nomination.



While there was a wintertime flirtation with Trump as the more establishment-friendly and malleable candidate for the GOP, springtime has brought a new realization that Trump could mean not just a general election wipeout, but also generational damage to the partys brand. Cruz has never been the GOPs dream date, but if he can beat Trump it may be enough.



As the latest WSJ/NBC News poll shows, Cruz runs best in a head-to-head matchup with Trump. It may be unthinkable for many country club Republicans that Cruz would be their best choice, but Rubios demise means that it is so.



Just two weeks ago, there were calls for Cruz to fall in behind Rubio for a unity ticket. Now, it seems very clear that unity will work in the other directions and that if the Republicans have a chance to stop Trump from taking over their party it will be Cruz at the top and Rubio as the junior partner.



The sincerity of Rubios attacks on Trump as a con man who is unfit for the presidency will be revealed by whether he not only drops out, but if he enthusiastically campaigns for Cruz in Florida for the next five days.

NEW POLL SHOWS HILLARY LEAD IN THE SUNSHINE STATE

The Hill: Hillary Clinton has healthy leads over Bernie Sanders in Florida and Ohio, where voters will cast ballots in Democratic primaries on March 15, according to a new poll. A Quinnipiac University survey released Wednesday found Clinton crushing Sanders 62 to 32 in the Sunshine State. Here, Clinton is boosted by a huge lead among women voters, who support her 69 percent to 24 percent over Sanders. Clinton also has an 8-point lead among men, and even has the advantage over the democratic socialist among those who describe themselves as very liberal. Young voters have been Sanderss bread and butter, but he and Clinton are tied among those under the age of 44 in Florida, each taking 49 percent.



What went wrong for Hillary in Michigan? - WaPos Philip Bump explains why the Democratic frontrunner lost what was supposed to be a safe state for her Tuesday night: Hillary Clinton lost the Michigan primary on Tuesday night, and the state pried open two critical seams holding her candidacy together...One thing that happened is that Clinton underperformed with black voters in the state. In Mississippi, which Clinton won easily, nearly two-thirds of the vote was black and it went for Clinton 9-to-1. Preliminary exit polling in Michigan suggests that only about a quarter of the electorate in the state was black -- and that Clinton's margin was closer to 2-to-1.



Bernie joins the fight in Ohio -Columbus Dispatch: A national voting rights organization - along with nine 17-year-old plaintiffs - is suing Secretary of State Jon Husted for his refusal to allow 17-year-olds to vote in next weeks presidential primary. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Democratic candidate for president, filed a separate suit on the matter in federal court. Sanders has strong support among younger voters...In Ohio, 17-year-olds can vote only to nominate candidates, not directly elect them. In the 2015 Election Manual, Husted claimed that since voters in presidential primaries are technically electing delegates, they cannot vote in those elections.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,New Iowa St coach wipes slate clean for team,[],"AMES, Iowa (AP) Matt Campbell has wiped the board clean for his inexperienced offensive line.

Everyone, the first-year Iowa State coach said, will get a chance to show what he can do, regardless of what might have happened in the past.

''Everybody starts with a clean slate, with no preconceived notions,'' Campbell said Tuesday after overseeing his first spring practice with the Cyclones. ''We've said that from day one -- allow these guys to start from scratch and really allow them to see what they look like over a period of time.''

Campbell actually has no choice in the matter. He must replace players who made 111 career starts and his most experienced returnee, junior Jake Campos, is doing very little this spring after undergoing hip surgery.

That leaves a lot of positions up for grabs among players who have seen little or no time on the field, a group that includes seniors Nick Fett and Patrick Scroggins, junior Shawn Curtis and junior college transfer Karson Green.

Fett started once last year but played mostly on special teams. Scroggins had been expected to contend at center in 2015 but was lost to a knee injury in preseason camp.

''There are some guys that have stood out,'' Campbell said. ''For me to give names right now I think is unfair until we see practice. I think some guys really did some great things in winter conditioning. Offensive line, that's kind of their time. Winter conditioning is really hard. You want to see who can kind of work through the tough times. I think some guys did some great things.''

Campbell, who replaced the fired Paul Rhoads, is so intent on giving everyone a fresh start that he did not release a depth chart.

''I told our guys it was a rep chart, quite honestly,'' he said. ''We'll sort it all out. We'll see what kind of skill sets match what our expectations are for the position. That's really not just the o-line. It's really across the board right now.''

Campos is doing light work this spring. On Tuesday, he jumped rope and did some running. He's expected to be back at full strength in the fall.

''He's another of what I'd call a football junkie,'' Campbell said. ''He's in the film room when we're in the film room. He's around all the time. I appreciate that about him. I've challenged him with his injury. Get your upper body strength to where it needs to be for you to be capable of being the best you can be.

''Right now if you look at him, he's a different guy than what he was eight weeks ago. He looks the part now. He's getting bigger and stronger.''

Campbell said the line will determine how the offense goes, though he has made it clear he wants to run the ball. Sophomore running Mike Warren gives him a good start. Warren ran for 1,339 yards during last fall's 3-9 season, the most ever by an ISU freshman.

''I've said this and I'll continue to say this about Michael: You've gone from the guy that's kind of the hunter to now being the guy that's going to be hunted. And that's a big change,'' Campbell said. ''Expectations rise and that's what's hard about having success early in a career -- do you have the mental capability to get better week in, week out, year in, year out? Mike's certainly under that microscope right now.''",[]

Thats the frosty message University of Oregon researchers are getting over a widely-ridiculed study on gender and glaciers that cost taxpayers a big chunk of cash.

Researchers at the school published a scientific study examining the relationship between gender and glaciers as part of a federally-funded government grant from the National Science Foundation.

The paper, titled Glaciers, gender, and science"" and authored by University of Oregon professor Mark Carey, found that ice is not just ice and called on scientists to take a feminist political ecology and feminist postcolonial approach when researching glaciers and climate change.

The study, which centers around ""feminist glaciology,"" was published in January and was part of a nearly half million dollar federal grant, according to The Free Beacon and College Fix -- though it's unclear how much of the $412,930 in funds went specifically toward Carey's paper.

Glaciers are key icons of climate change and global environmental change, Carey wrote. However, the relationships among gender, science, and glaciers -- particularly related to epistemological questions about the production of glaciological knowledge -- remain understudied.""

""Merging feminist postcolonial science studies and feminist political ecology, the feminist glaciology framework generates robust analysis of gender, power and epistemologies in dynamic social-ecological systems, thereby leading to more just and equitable science and human-ice interactions, the paper reads.

Writing on Powerlineblog.com, Steven Hayward called the study

""academic gibberish,"" and said he initially thought the paper was

parody.

Im sure Carey is well-intentioned, but if his goal was to put a human face on climate change, he failed, Robby Soave wrote in Reason magazine. The paper is simply impossible to read with a straight face. It employs liberal buzzwords -- colonialism, marginalization, masculinist discourses, etc. -- with such frequency that the entire thing comes off like a joke.

The University of Oregon said in a Feb. 26 press release that Carey hired undergraduate student Jaclyn Rushing to ""explore how nongovernmental organizations were addressing melting Himalayan glaciers.""

""Her dive into the literature found that women's voices are rarely heard in glacier-related research, a finding that triggered a larger project and led to a paper now online ahead of print by the journal Progress in Human Geography,"" the statement said.

The press release went on to quote Carey as saying, ""Jaclyn found a report that noted how women are more vulnerable to glacier changes and hazards than are men.""

""I had never researched these gendered vulnerabilities,"" said Carey, an associate dean of the Clark Honors College and a professor of history and environmental studies.

Carey did not respond to a request for comment when contacted Tuesday.

The National Science Foundation funded the study as part of a project that initially set out to examine the early development and subsequent evolution of the five main aspects of glaciology,"" according to The Free Beacon.

The paper poses the question, Why feminist glaciology? and then answers it by arguing that scientific research of glaciers has been dominated by men and masculinity.

""Most existing glaciological research -- and hence discourse and discussions about cryospheric change -- stems from information produced by men, about men, with manly characteristics, and within masculinist discourses, the paper says.",[]

Dorian Murray died Tuesday, according to a post on the boy's official Facebook page.

""He was surrounded by people who love him and his transition to heaven was very peaceful. He was embraced by both mom and dad,"" the post by family friend Kathryn Thomas said.

Dorian, of Westerly, was diagnosed with a rare and untreatable form of pediatric cancer, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ahl-VEE'-oh-lyr rab-doh-my-oh-sar-KOH'-mah), when he was 4. After cancer cells spread to his spinal fluid a few months ago, he and his family decided to stop his chemotherapy treatment so he could enjoy the time he had left.

Not long after, Dorian told his father he wanted to be famous in China before he went to heaven. His father, Chris, a police officer in Stonington, Connecticut, posted the wish on Dorian's Facebook page, urging people to use the hashtag #DStrong. It spread across the globe.

People from places as far away as Australia and Florida sent him photos and well wishes, and #DStrong became a trending topic on social media. It especially took off in China, where people sent photos of themselves on the Great Wall holding signs reading #DStrong. Dorian and his family also received invitations to travel to China, but declined due to his health.

The Rhode Island General Assembly declared Jan. 20 ""#DStrong Day.""

Dorian's family announced earlier this week that they planned to establish the Dorian J. Murray Foundation to raise money for pediatric cancer research and to help support families of children with pediatric cancer.

People in the community expressed sorrow at Dorian's death, including Roy Seitsinger Jr., superintendent of Westerly schools. He told families in a message that Dorian was a ""precocious, gregarious, and loving little boy,"" the Westerly Sun reported.",[]

""This can't be just another campaign,"" Raul Castro said during the meeting he presided over at the Public Health Ministry to analyze the measures being applied throughout the country to stop the spread of illnesses transmitted by mosquitoes of the Aedes genus, the daily Granma said Monday.

At the meeting with health authorities, the government, the ruling Communist Party and the armed forces, Cuba's president said it is ""vital to check that everything is being done well, in a trustworthy and timely manner.""

He also described as ""chronic"" the situation of garbage collection in Havana, where some 810,000 cubic feet of trash is created daily, of which some 222,000 are left in the streets due to the lack of garbage trucks.

Castro ordered the country to give a ""definitive solution"" to this problem, ""without improvisation"" and with ""discipline"" as to working hours and the reparation and maintenance of equipment used for that service in the nation's capital.

For several weeks, Cuba has been developing an action program that includes the mobilizing of 9,000 troops of the armed forces and 200 police to carry out fumigations and inspections in homes and workplaces to deal with the Zika virus, dengue and Chikungunya.

Health authorities have said through local media that the purpose of the plan is to combat the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, both carriers of these diseases, and both present on various parts of the island.

Noreen was scheduled to go into the hospital to have three ribs treated for small tumors, a procedure called cryoablation (which she has undergone before). Two days before she was to have the procedure, she woke up in excruciating pain.

At first they thought it was her heart, but then decided it was another rib, in the front. She went in for the cryoablation procedure (now for four ribs), and Dr. Genshaft was surprised. It wasnt a fourth rib, it was her gallbladder.

Noreen had a hot gallbladder (inflamed).**

The question then became: Do they remove the gallbladder or drain it for eight to 10 weeks? Because of her somewhat deteriorating physical condition, they decided to put in a drain.

Thats where we are.

When her pain subsides enough from the gallbladder attack, she will be scheduled for the cryoablation procedure on the three ribs.

I just want to say that Noreen manages her pain in an amazing fashion. She still gives me orders! I love this woman.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,The Real Winners and Losers from the March 8 Primaries,[],"EXCERPT FROM THE WASHINGTON POST:



Winners

*Donald Trump: The talk of the last few days -- especially here in Washington -- centered on the possibility of the Trump bubble having, finally, burst. Two national polls released on Tuesday showed him with a shrunken lead over Ted Cruz; many people looked to Michigan and Mississippi to see if Trump might underperform or even lose in those two states. Nope! Michigan was called for Trump as soon as polls closed across the Wolverine State at 9 p.m. Eastern Time and Mississippi was called for him just 30 minutes after polls closed there. The Mississippi exit polls are instructive as to Trump's dominance. Trump won those who identified as ""very"" conservative, ""somewhat"" conservative and moderate/liberal. That's, well, all of them.

This was a night that sets up Trump perfectly for March 15 when, if he wins Ohio and Florida, the race will be effectively over. He will almost certainly be the momentum candidate going into those states next week. And the struggles of Marco Rubio -- more on that below -- only make Trump's path easier.

* Bernie Sanders: Yes, the Vermont senator got destroyed in Mississippi. But, in the bigger and high-profile state of Michigan, Sanders heavily overperformed polling that showed Clinton ahead by 20 points or more. Winning a big Midwestern state is of deep symbolic importance for Sanders, who was on the verge of being cast as a nuisance candidate by many Democrats.



On the night Michigan and Mississippi Democratic voters went to the polls, candidate Hillary Clinton said she was proud of the campaigns she and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are running. Meanwhile, Sanders expressed confidence that Democrats would ""beat Mr. Trump"" in November. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)

Sanders may have also found an issue where he can do real damage to Clinton as the campaign goes forward. Almost six in 10 Michigan Democratic primary voters said international trade takes away U.S. jobs, according to exit polling. Among that group Sanders won by roughly 20 percentage points over Clinton. That could -- and should -- bode well for his efforts in Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin and other states where international trade has ravaged the economy. ""What tonight means is that the Bernie Sanders campaign... is strong in every part of the country,"" Sanders said in brief remarks in Florida Tuesday night. ""We believe our strongest areas are yet to happen.""

Sanders had previously pledged to stay in the race through the June 7 primaries and, as I've noted, he has plenty of money to do so. Now he has even more reason to do so.

*Paul O'Neill: The former Yankee (and Reds) outfielder was in attendance at Trump's rally in Florida. And, of course, Trump cajoled an endorsement out of the former slugger and then spent the rest of his victory press conference touting O'Neill's support. I -- and most of the rest of the country -- probably hadn't thought about Paulie in years. But, on Tuesday night, he was back on center stage.

* Trump, the Brand: Trump Steaks! Trump Water! Trump Wine! Trump Magazine! Trump Golf Club! Trump celebrated himself during his victory speech/press conference on Tuesday night. Not only did he bring steaks, water and wine to his rally, he spent a good chunk of his actual speech talking about how great they are and how successful each of his businesses are. It was surreal -- until you stop and remember this is Donald Trump we're talking about.

*Abe Lincoln: ""Very presidential,"" according to Trump. I am sure Honest Abe would have loved Trump wine if he had ever got the chance to try it.



Losers

* Marco Rubio: Oomph. Rubio finished WAY off the lead in Michigan and Mississippi and looked to be in very serious danger of not qualifying to win a single delegate from either. (A candidate needs 15 percent statewide to get delegates in Michigan and Mississippi.) Even as those terrible results were coming in, Rubio continued to insist that Florida was the only state that mattered.

Well, um, ok. It was hard to see Rubio winning Florida before Tuesday night. It's even harder to imagine him winning it now since the next seven days will be filled with questions about a) whether he is staying in the race and b) whether he should stay in the race. Rubio, who is still in his early 40s, has to consider his future -- and fast. Losing Florida -- particularly if he loses badly -- could damage Rubio's political career going forward on both the state and national level.

* Mitt Romney: The 2012 nominee claimed credit for slowing Trump down after the votes on Saturday -- telling ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd on Sunday that his speech discrediting the former real estate mogul mattered. Um, maybe not? Michigan, as you might remember, was a state that Romney's father, George, represented as governor and one that Mitt won in the 2008 and 2012 GOP primaries.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Warming friendship: A man and a penguin forge a bond over thousands of miles,[],"A Chinese proverb says that when you save a life, youre forever responsible for it. And so it goes with a widowed fisherman, living on a remote beach in Brazil and his small but loyal feathered friend.

He calls him Jinjing, and without fail, the Magellanic penguin returns, like the prodigal son, after disappearing for days, weeks and even months to reconnect with the retired bricklayer, Joao Pereira de Souza  the human who saved his life.

The relationship was forever bonded in 2011, when de Souza found the oil-soaked bird lying on a beach by his shady home in Rio de Janeiro state. De Souza, 71, fed the bird sardines and enticed it to drink water.

Jinjing is a term of endearment in parts of Brazil, and not unlike a dog, the penguin never lets de Souza down  and even manages to perform his penguin duties.

Once a year, Jingjing joins thousands of other Magellanic penguins and migrates some 2,000 miles south to the Patagonia region during breeding season, which lasts from early September through February. And then he always comes back to the warm stretch of sand in Proveta, in southeast Brazil.

When he returns hes so happy to see me, Mr. de Souza told The Wall Street Journal. He comes up to my neck and hoots, he added.

Magellanic penguins typically live up to 25 years in the wild.

According to some scientists, overfishing may account for birds like Jingjing ending up so farther north into the tropics. In fact, in 2004 Magellanic penguins were included in the list of the International Union for Conservation of Natures Red List of Threatened Species.

Mr. de Souzas daughter, Mery Alves de Souza, told the Journal that her father fusses so much over Jinjing that it is hard to persuade him to visit his real children in Rio de Janeiro, six hours away.

In June, he planned to stay in Rio a week but returned home after two days, fearing Jinjing wouldnt get enough to eat. We call him and tell him to come visit and he says, OK, OK,  she says. But then he doesnt.

Its like a son to him.

Like any devoted friend, Jinjing can be jealous, scaring off any animal that dares approach de Souza.

I never saw a critter get so attached, Mr. de Souza said. ""You can let him go wherever you want, but hell come right back.

Mr. Tassone is a no-nonsense God & Country fellow who takes pride in Old Glory and his signature Animal Burger  made from 24 ounces of American Love.

We talk religions and politics and we encourage people to carry their guns, Mr. Tassone told me. The Second Amendment protects all the rest of them.

They also encourage folks to say Grace.

 We dont like political correctness or special interest

 If you really dont like America  LEAVE

 Actually, I did build MY business

 Everyone doesnt get the same size trophy

 Govt and taxes are the problem

And these days Mr. Tassone is especially upset with the government.

On Dec. 31, 2015, the state of New York implemented a new minimum wage for tipped workers. Wages increased from $5 to $7.50 an hour.

Its absolutely killing us, Mr. Tassone told me. My payroll has gone up over $21,000. We have to find a way to pay for that.

Its a problem facing family-owned restaurants across New York, reports the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. Many have been forced to pass along the additional costs to their customers.

I had to lay off a worker and I have to work 103 hours a week, he said. I just have to try to take on additional time and hours to make it work.

And he also decided to poke a bit of fun at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and President Obama by naming a new breakfast special in their honor.

Its called the Dictator Obama/NYS Special (King Cuomo).

The breakfast includes two eggs and a slice of toast for $3.59. The tax is $27.99.

We took a good jab at them, he said.

As you might imagine, the Obama special isnt exactly selling like hot cakes.

If they really want to pay that much for two eggs and a piece of toast, well sell it to them, he said.

Mr. Tassone illustrated how difficult its becoming to run a business in America. Theres only so much you can tax consumers.

On the other hand, a sandwich named after the first lady is one of the diners hottest items.

Its called, The Anti-Michelle Obama, Dont Tell Me What to Eat or Feed My Kids Burger.

Its a 16-ounce beef patty with bacon and cheese  along with a side of fries.

He might want to throw in a pack of Rolaids, too.

Pound told The Associated Press that Sharapova could face a ban of up to four years unless she can prove mitigating circumstances to explain her positive test for meldonium at the Australian Open in January.

Meldonium, a Latvian-manufactured drug designed to treat heart conditions, was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned list on Jan. 1 after authorities noticed widespread use of the substance among athletes.

In announcing her positive test at a news conference in Los Angeles on Monday, Sharapova said she had been using the drug for 10 years for various medical issues. The five-time Grand Slam champion and world's highest-earning female athlete said she hadn't realized meldonium had been prohibited this year, taking full responsibility for her mistake.

""An athlete at that level has to know that there will be tests, has to know that whatever she or he is taking is not on the list, and it was willful negligence to miss that,"" Pound said. ""She was warned in advance I gather. The WADA publication is out there. She didn't pay any attention to it. The tennis association issued several warnings, none of which she apparently read.""

""I am sorry, if you are running a $30 million a year sole enterprise you better make sure the basis for that commercial success, if nothing else, remains unassailable,"" Pound added in the interview with the AP on the sidelines of the Tackling Doping in Sport conference at Twickenham Stadium.

Current WADA president Craig Reedie questioned why Sharapova was prescribed meldonium.

""If the reports are true and this was happening when she was a teenager, then you begin to wonder why a drug that is basically to help heart problems was administered,"" he said.

Pound disclosed that international tennis officials had flagged up the use of meldonium to the WADA committee that monitors the use of various drugs and recommends whether to put them on the banned list.

""Clearly, within the tennis circle at least, they were aware that a lot of the players were using it (meldonium) and said that there must be something to this, so they referred it to the WADA list committee,"" Pound said.

So far, Sharapova is the only tennis player with a known positive test for meldonium.

Meldonium, which is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, was banned by WADA because it aids oxygen uptake and endurance. Several other athletes in various international sports have already been caught using it since it was banned Jan. 1.

A study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found that up to 490 athletes may have been taking meldonium during last year's inaugural European Games in Baku, Azerbaijan. The drug was not banned at that time.

The study found that 13 winners or medalists were taking meldonium, 66 athletes tested positive for it, and the drug was detected in athletes in 15 of the 21 sports on the program. The research contributed to WADA's decision to add meldonium to the banned list.

Sharapova is being provisionally suspended by the International Tennis Federation, which will hold hearings on the case and decide on any long-term ban.

""She faces up to four years sanction for this,"" Pound said. ""There will have to be a review of whatever mitigating factors there may be, and not many leap to mind.""

Pound said he did not understand why Sharapova would have been taking the drug for so long.

The player said Monday that she had taken meldonium for a decade following various health problems including regular sicknesses, early signs of diabetes and ""irregular"" results from echocardiography exams.

""Looking at it from 10,000 feet and from outside, you say, `I am sorry but that doesn't hold together,""' Pound said. ""You're in the United States, this is a product that is not available in the United States, and so there has got to be more to this than meets the eye.""

Grindeks, the Latvian company that manufactures meldonium, said the normal course of treatment with meldonium is four to six weeks.

""One of the issues that will have to be dealt with is that the use of this product for therapeutic purposes is not a long term,"" Pound said. ""You use it for a single intervention for weeks or months maybe, but not for 10 years in a row.""

Sharapova's lawyer, John J. Haggerty, said Tuesday that he wanted ""to disabuse the concept that Maria took mildronate every day for 10 years because that's simply not the case.""",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,5 energy boosting foods you should add to your day,['Tanya Zuckerbrot'],"We all know that feeling, 3 p.m. rolls around and we get that midday crash. But we dont need to reach for energy drinks or high calorie bars. Beat that midday slump without breaking the diet by using one of the tips below:

Sugar-free gum

Thats right. Research has found that chewing gum increases heart rate and improves blood flow to your brain, which can increase alertness. Further, opting for a fresh, mint flavored stick will wake up your senses even more. Easily accessible and hassle-free, chewing gum is a great quick fix.

Cardamom

This popular Asian spice improves your energy supply by promoting blood flow throughout your body. You can easily integrate this spice into your meals by sprinkling it over vegetables or adding it into your chicken or meat spice blend. Alternatively, opt for a mug of chai tea- another great source of this energy-boosting spice.

Spinach

Bulk up your salad with this iron-rich leafy green. Low iron levels in the body can correspond with low energy levels. Why? Iron is a key component in transporting oxygen in the body. A mere two cups of spinach provides 12mg of iron- more than half of your daily recommended intake! Added bonus: spinach is also high in fiber, which helps sustain our energy.

Pistachios

Pistachios are high in protein and fiber, which aid in stabilizing your blood sugar, providing you with long lasting energy. Pistachios are a great on-the-go snack for the calorie-conscious, as 25 pistachios weigh in at only 100 calories, while providing a whopping 6g of protein and 2g of fiber!

Additional tip: Buy the pistachios with the shell on-- this will slow you down as you eat, giving your body time to sense that youre getting full.

Water

Its old school. Feeling tired is one of the first signs of dehydration. Before reaching for another cup of coffee, have another glass of water instead! Adding more water-rich foods, such as cucumbers or lettuce, to your meals is another way to increase your water intake, while boosting your fiber intake as well. Still struggling to stay hydrated? Make it fun and track your intake-- theres an app for that!

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,How to keep your frequent flier miles from expiring,['David Fleming'],"If youre like me, the thought of losing your frequent flier miles to an expiration date can leave you feeling like you gotta plan a trip  and fast!

Lets face it: you spent a lot of hours cramped in a cabin, criss-crossing the country (or countries) earning those points. And dont even get me started on the amount of money you may have charged on rewards earning credit cards to rack up miles. Its work. A lot of work.

But beware. The airlines may giveth, but they are just as quick to taketh those miles away.

It may come as a surprise to learn an estimated 39 billion points expire every year. Many times people just dont realize frequent flier miles, like cartons of milk, can come with an expiration date. And just about every airline has its own rules about how long your points will last.

The confusing part is keeping up with those ever-changing regulations the airlines can alter on a whim.

Alaska Airlines miles, for instance, expire if theres no activity in your account for two years. American Airlines points expire 18 months after your last transaction. Thats the case with many other carriers. Delta may be the exception to the rule. Its SkyMiles, as theyre called, used to expire but not anymore at least not for now.

Still, for those of you with a countdown clock on your points, these simple tips will breathe new life into your miles.

Buy some miles.

Something as simple as purchasing 1,000 points (for as little as around $40) could extend the longevity of your miles up to three years. A little account activity like transferring in miles from a friend or relative could reset the clock on the expiration date as well.

Keep track of your points.

I get it. Youre busy. The kids are screaming. The big project is due at work. Its hard to remember what points you have, let alone when theyre set to expire. The good news is there are free websites out there that do that for you. Awardwallet.com makes it its mission to not only keep track of your airline, car and hotel loyalty programs (it even tracks Starbucks Reward points,) itll send you a reminder email letting you know your miles are about to cease to exist.

Take a drive.

Car rental companies often partner with airlines, so you can actually earn miles while you hit the highway. Next time you rent a car, simply ask to apply your airline frequent flier number to the reservation. The same thing goes with some hotels which have their own loyalty programs. Its always worth asking when checking in.

Go shopping.

Charges on an airline branded credit card like the Chase United MileagePlus Explorer Card or the Citi AAdvantage MasterCard will keep miles coming in and lasting longer too. And you can earn bonus points by doing your spending online at the various airline shopping portals. Think of them as virtual shopping malls with your favorite stores except spend here, and you get bonus miles.

Take a trip.

There are some good mileage deals out there. On average you need 12,500 points for a one-way economy ticket. But check this out: British Airways will let you fly from Los Angeles to Las Vegas for 7,500 of its Avios points. Even better, you can snag a seat on a flight from London to Paris for just 4,500 miles. Take advantage of your miles now because points devalue over time which means the longer you wait, the more miles itll take to get an award booking.

Gone but not forgotten.

Now, for those of you saying, Thanks Miles Guy but my points are already gone, there may be some good news. Turns out, at least two of the big carriers--American Airlines and United Airlines --will actually allow you to purchase back some of your expired miles for a fee. I once found a client more than 500,000 United MileagePlus miles that had expired, simply by calling the airline and asking if there were any points he could purchase back. Around $500 later, hes sitting on enough points to send he and his family first class anywhere on earth. That was a call worth making.

David Fleming is known as the The Miles Guy. He has made a business out of helping people use their points to travel.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"Saving Yazidis from ISIS, one captive at a time",['Hollie Mckay'],"Nearly 2,400 Yazidi men, women and children have been ransomed, rescued or lucky enough to escape the clutches of ISIS, according to new figures from a Kurdish government bureau that works closely with the minority Iraqi religious community.

The Yazidi community, with the protection of the Kurdish Regional Government and funding from around the world, has formed an extensive international network to save their women from sexual slavery and men from serving in the black-clad jihadist army.

The younger and more beautiful she is and the less number of children she has  if any  will make her more expensive. - Abu Shujaa

There are several ways, Abu Shujaa, who established a volunteer group with safe houses and has managed an underground rescue railroad to liberate hundreds of Yazidis since the ISIS onslaught in his hometown of Sinjar, told FoxNews.com. Sometimes the girls access phones and contact family members or friends and they get directed to us.

Other times, volunteers investigate and locate where the girls were taken, and when they find out they then reach out to them and arrange the escape, he added. There are other ways too, but we cant reveal yet as there are a whole lot of girls left we have to rescue.

The Kurdistan Regional Governments Office of the Prime Minister has a special bureau dedicated to observing the rescue of Yazidi victims. Although it plays no role in negotiating with captors, in cases in which family members pay ransom, the office reimburses them.

Of an estimated 4,029 Yazidi women and girls abducted over the last three years, some 1,456 have been rescued, according to statistics from the Kurdish government, which works with the Yazidi community.

While women are held by ISIS for sex, men are captured and forced into the terrorist army. Some 3,403 men and boys have been captured, with just more than 900 making it back to their families. In total, some 1,293 Yazidis have been killed by ISIS, many of them among the men and boys taken and given the choice of joining ISIS or being killed. Another 460 remain unaccounted for.

The tight-knit community, which is concentrated along the nations northern Ninevah Plain, has endured horrific suffering since the rise of ISIS. Of a population estimated at 550,000 before the terrorist army began its ethnic and religious cleansing campaign, some 400,000 have been displaced according to the directorate.

While entering ISIS-held territory could mean death for Yazidis, they have a network of civilian women trapped inside Mosul and other places within the so-called caliphate who want to do something good for humanity and help, according to Shujaa.

With help from their Kurdish allies, as well as Muslim sympathizers, Yazidis have pulled together to deliver their women and girls from the misery inflicted by ISIS. The Yazidi religion includes elements of ancient nature-worship, as well as influences from Christianity, Gnosticism, Zoroastrianism, Islam and Judaism, and ISIS justifies its slavery and slaughter under the guise that Yazidis are devil worshippers.

By enslaving women, ISIS is effectively cleansing the lands of Yazidi and other minority groups of their ethnic identity, said Daniel Sullivan, director of policy and government relations at the Washington-based nonprofit United to End Genocide.

Rescue typically involves several intermediaries carrying out a series of steps such as smuggling cellphones and counterfeit IDs into the places where the girls are being held, establishing a network of safe houses and long journeys on foot under cover of darkness.

The process has been managed and supervised by the family of the victims themselves, said Yakhi Balak, who heads a Yazidi task force that works with the Kurdistan Regional Government to facilitate and track rescue operations. The family coordinates with their religious leaders with the moral support of local Yazidi communities.

Each successful rescue has its own dramatic and harrowing tale. The family of one girl told FoxNews.com their daughter was granted permission to use her captors phone and was able to alert outsiders with a rough description of her location. That allowed Yazidi activists to put a plan into place, working with contacts inside Mosul. Another girl told of escaping through a broken window when her captor was not at home. She hid in a sympathetic familys home until smugglers could reach her.

Such escapes are the exception, not the rule. Most Yazidis who have made it out of ISIS captivity owe their freedom to ransom paid by loved ones and with funds raised by international charities. Fees for buying back a Yazidi captive vary wildly  as do the prices wealthy Arabs and ISIS fighters pay for them at stomach-turning auctions held in public squares.

The younger and more beautiful she is and the less number of children she has  if any  will make her more expensive, Shujaa said. Every girl comes back with a unique story that is very powerful and emotional. Some of them as young as 8 are being raped and enslaved. A few days ago, a beautiful 11-year-old girl was sold at the market in Raqqa for the equivalent of $20,000.

Ransom fees generally must cover whatever the slave buyer paid, plus a profit and, in most cases, a cut for Sunni tribesmen who often facilitate negotiations. Just over a year ago, a Yazidi family could buy back a daughter for as little as $300. Now, the price can top $13,000, according to Yazidi officials.

In many cases the local wealthy Arab residents were among the buyers of sex slaves, Balak said. Different prices were paid at the time of purchase and in some cases slaves were sold for a profit. Buy back prices were usually higher than slave market price.

Many Yazidi families have scraped together the money needed for a loved ones safe return only to find out theyve been tricked, an Iraqi with close ties to the government in Baghdad said.

The scammers are everywhere, he said. They are in Iraq and they are outside of Iraq. Its terrible.

Rescue groups have raised funds in North America, including through GoFundMe.com. The efforts have raised alarms in some quarters, both that donors could be getting scammed and also that, even if the funds go to ransom, the process makes captives more valuable and the money ends up in the hands of ISIS.

The lack of monitoring on the ground means Western governments must clamp down on funds headed for the caliphate, even if intentions are good, said Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, director of Israel Law Center, which focuses on blocking funding to terror groups.

A representative for crowd-funding platform GoFundMe told FoxNews.com that red flags have indeed been raised as to whether campaigns of this nature have directed funds to ISIS in order to secure the release of hostages, and that they have referred matters to the Office of Foreign Assets Control with concerns over violations of U.S. sanctions.

A spokesperson for the U.S Department of the Treasury responded that online donations are not a significant contributor to ISILs wealth.

Rather, it remains the case that ISIL has generated the vast majority of its funds through oil and gas, extortion, and looting banks in the regions that it controls, the spokesperson said.

Liberating a young girl from the clutches of ISIS is worth whatever a heartsick parent  or a determined community  can afford, said Balak.

However, other than some sort of cash exchange there are seemingly few other options to bring back the innocent victims.

Looking at the greater human tragic picture, rescuing a human being in the hands of savages should not be counted toward terrorism funding, Balak added.",[]

The hottest show on Broadway was not only inspired by the life of a Founding Father, but also by ... Kanye West?

Lin-Manuel Miranda, the writer and star of the Broadway hit Hamilton, revealed that he told West that his sold-out hip-hop show about Alexander Hamilton totally reflects the rappers life.

""Kim was like, 'And the three sisters!'"" Miranda recounted. ""And I was like, 'Yes, and the three sisters. It's all about you.'""

Hamilton remains the hottest ticket on the Great White Way after changing the way Americans think about history, musicals and even the Founding Fathers. Its sold out through January 2017 with tickets typically going well over $500 and for as much as $2,000 on resale each night.

One, I think the music just speaks their language in a way that doesnt feel like a leap, Miranda told Fox News Latino recently about the shows appeal. Two, I think Hamilton is kind of a bad-ass. He did a lot while he was alive, he died young, and I think that kids are more aware of that than we think.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Iran reportedly test-fires 2 long-range missiles while Biden visits Israel,[],"Iran reportedly test-fired two ballistic missiles Wednesday with the phrase ""Israel must be wiped out"" written in Hebrew on them, but authorities said that the tests do not violate the nuclear deal reached in January.

The tests came as Vice President Joe Biden visited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was strongly opposed to the nuke deal.

I want to reiterate because I know people still doubt: If in fact they break the deal, we will act, Biden said in Jerusalem.

The semiofficial Fars news agency offered pictures Wednesday it said were of the Qadr H missiles being fired. It said they were fired in Iran's eastern Alborz mountain range to hit a target some 870 miles away off Iran's coast into the Sea of Oman.

Hard-liners in Iran's military have fired rockets and missiles despite U.S. objections since the deal, as well as shown underground missile bases on state television.

The missiles fired today are the results of sanctions, Brig. Gen. Hossein Salami, a deputy commander of the Guards told Fars news agency, according to the BBC. The sanctions helped Iran develop its missile program.

There was no immediate reaction from Jerusalem, where Biden was scheduled to speak to Netanyahu.

The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which patrols that region, declined to comment on the test. Fars quoted Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard's aerospace division, saying the test was aimed at showing Israel that Iran could hit it.

Iranian state television showed one of the missiles being fired from an underground silo sometime overnight, Reuters reported.

""The 1,240-mile range of our missiles is to confront the Zionist regime,"" Hajizadeh said. ""Israel is surrounded by Islamic countries and it will not last long in a war. It will collapse even before being hit by these missiles.""

Israel's Foreign Ministry declined to immediately comment. Iran has threatened to destroy Israel in the past. Israel, which is believed to have the only nuclear weapons arsenal in the Mideast, repeatedly has threatened to take military action against Iran's nuclear facilities.

Hajizadeh stressed Iran would not fire the missiles in anger or start a war with Israel.

""We will not be the ones who start a war, but we will not be taken by surprise, so we put our facilities somewhere that our enemies cannot destroy them so that we could continue long war,"" he said.

The firing of the Qadr H missiles comes after a U.S. State Department spokesman on Tuesday criticized another missile launch that day, saying America planned to bring it before the United Nations Security Council.

A nuclear deal between Iran and world powers including the U.S. is now under way, negotiated by the administration of moderate President Hassan Rouhani. In the time since the deal, however, hard-liners in Iran's military have made several shows of strength.

In October, Iran successfully test-fired a new guided long-range ballistic surface-to-surface missile. It was the first such test since Iran and world powers reached a landmark nuclear deal last summer.

U.N. experts said the launch used ballistic missile technology banned under a Security Council resolution. In January, the U.S. imposed new sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the ballistic missile program.

Iran also has fired rockets near U.S. warships and flown an unarmed drone over an American aircraft carrier in recent months.

In January, Iran seized 10 U.S. sailors in the Gulf when their two riverine command boats headed from Kuwait to Bahrain ended up in Iranian territorial waters after the crews ""misnavigated,"" the U.S. military said. The sailors were taken to a small port facility on Farsi Island, held for about 15 hours and released after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke several times with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Iona clinches NCAA Tournament berth with MAAC tourney title,[],"ALBANY, N.Y. -- A.J. English hit a fadeway jumper with 1:39 left to break a tie and Deyshonee Much followed with a driving layup that he converted into a three-point play, and second-seeded Iona beat top-seeded Monmouth 79-76 on Monday night to win the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference tournament title and the NCAA Tournament berth that goes with it.

The Hawks (27-7), who joined the MAAC in 2013, were seeking their first tournament appearance since 2006 when they were members of the Northeast Conference. They entered the title game on a five-game winning streak and had won 13 of 14 in a storybook season, the lone loss coming at Iona (22-10).

With a solid resume, the Hawks are still in the running for an at-large bid and the MAAC has twice had multiple bids (1995, 2012).

The game came down to the final moments. A 3-pointer from the right corner by Much gave Iona a 66-65 lead with 4:44 left before Josh James tied it at 67 with a pretty spin move through the lane. But he was called for a technical after gesturing and yelling at the Gaels, and English sank both free throws.

A tip-in by Jordan Washington gave Iona a 71-67 lead before a pair of free throws by Micah Seaborn narrowed the gap to 71-69 at 3:24. Two more free throws by Justin Robinson tied it at 71-all.

Monmouth made a gallant try in the final minute, forcing a turnover when Much was called for a foul while the Hawks were pressing. Deon Jones sank both free throws to make it a one-point game, but Aaron Rountree calmly made two for the Gaels with 17.3 seconds left and the Hawks couldn't get a shot in the final seconds.

Before Monday, Monmouth was 21-0 when leading at the break.

English, named tournament MVP, led Iona with 19 points, Isaiah Williams had 17, and Washington and Much each had 15.

Je'lon Hornbeak paced Monmouth with 20 points, Robinson had 12 and Seaborn 10.

The Monmouth bench mob has made a name for itself this year as the players have come up with one-of-a-kind celebrations during games. They celebrated a lot again on Monday, until the end.

Monmouth had to keep close watch on English, who averaged 38 points, four assists, 5.5 rebounds and 5.5 3-pointers against the Hawks in the regular season and was coming off a 29-point effort in an 11-point win over Siena in Sunday's semifinals.

English struggled mightily in the opening half, going 1 for 7 -- with all but one of the shots from beyond the arc. But Robinson, his counterpart on the Hawks, didn't score until hitting a pull-up jumper with 4.6 seconds left to give Monmouth a 34-30 halftime lead.

The Hawks closed the first half with a 19-7 spurt to gain its first lead as Hornbeak and Seaborn each hit a pair of 3-pointers to help erase an eight-point deficit.

The teams split in the regular season, each winning at home.

In the first meeting, Monmouth managed a 110-102 victory to establish itself as the team to beat in the conference. The Hawks overcame 45 points from English, who repeatedly taunted the opposing bench after made shots in the first half.

Words were exchanged at some point during the postgame handshake line, and Iona's Washington slapped the face of Monmouth big man Chris Brady.

TIP-INS:

Iona: The Gaels have a league-record nine titles and were the second seed for the sixth time. They had won two of their previous MAAC titles as the second seed and were 1-0 against Monmouth in the MAAC tournament. ... Coach Tim Cluess moved into second place all-time with 140 wins, one more than Jeff Ruland. Jim McDermott won 319 from 1948-73. ... Entering the game, English was 43 points shy of becoming the third player in school history to score 2,000. ... Since winning the MAAC title in 2013, Iona had lost two straight MAAC championship games to Manhattan.

Monmouth: The Hawks were one of the surprise teams nationally during the regular season. In nonconference play they defeated UCLA, Notre Dame, Southern Cal, Georgetown and Rutgers. ... Robinson entered the game with 650 points and needed 13 to match Alex Blackwell's school record set in 1990-91. ... Monmouth's last loss was at Iona on Feb. 19. ... Fifth-year coach King Rice won MAAC coach of the year.

DEJA VU: It was a deja vu moment for English. A year ago, he hit 13 of 20 from beyond the arc in Iona's first two games of the 2015 MAAC tournament, including 7 for 10 against the Hawks in the semis. He was a non-factor in the second half of the championship game loss to Manhattan, though, failing to score and attempting only three shots in scoring just 10 points in the game. After going 10 for 20 from long range in the first two games of this year's tournament, English missed his first four shots on Monday night.

Turns out they turned to their parents for help as the problem got hardere.g., after a longer delay, or if hidden behind a curtain. And in doing so, they guessed correctly more often.

""Children are capable of learning and questioning from an extremely young age,"" reports Time. ""This means engaging the child, not just plonking him in front of a screen. It means that even when you're playing with your baby, he or she is learning about learning."" (Check out why babies smile.)

foxnews.com,2016-02-25 00:00:00,"Meet 'Captain Crunch,' the Pentagon gun muncher that has destroyed 1M firearms",['Cody Derespina'],"Its the place where military weapons go to die.

Once a weapon is marked for destruction, it is sent to Anniston Army Depot where it will more than likely spend its final moments being chomped apart by the militarys Grim Reaper for guns: ""Captain Crunch.""

The massive metal shredder has been in operation since the early 1990s and has used a pair of intertwined blades to chop up more than a million weapons during that time.

There were days when approximately 2,500 weapons, mostly rifles that were deemed unserviceable, were shredded using Captain Crunch, said Susan Lowe, a public affairs specialist for the Defense Logistics Agency, the overarching government organization that oversees the demilitarization work done at Anniston. Approximately 500-600 pistols that were deemed unserviceable can be demilitarized in a day using Captain Crunch.

Lowe said in an email to FoxNews.com that any small arm or light weapon in the military arsenal marked for destruction has probably passed through Anniston, which is the only small arms demilitarization center in the United States. Despite the huge number of weapons that flow into the facility, Lowe said Captain Crunch can be operated with a minimum of two people.

The Army Depot sits on a 25-square-mile tract of land about 10 miles outside Anniston, Ala. and about 60 miles east of Birmingham. The facility does more that destroy; it also repairs all manner of combat vehicles. But inside the Nichols Industrial Complex sits Captain Crunch.

No one seems to know who first coined the catchy moniker; however, its not difficult to imagine why it was devised. Completely intact weapons are loaded on a conveyor belt at the front of the machine, and by the time Captain Crunch spits them back out, theyve been deconstructed into small, jagged metal scraps.

We have one guy that throws em in, feeds the Crunch, said one operator, Jason Nail, during an interview for the History Channel series Boneyard in 2007. At least two, if not three, other guys on the line make sure nothing dont go where its not supposed to go. All the little pieces that come off  triggers, sights, bolts, etcetera  get thrown into the box. We take the box at the end, when were done using Captain Crunch, bring it to the torch cutting stations and light em up.

Rifles, though larger, are easier to destroy. Small weapons take more time because of the smaller parts and pieces that each must be sufficiently demolished.

Two types of weapons are sent to the shredder: those deemed unserviceable and those that are obsolete. The determinations are made by the individual military services that used the weapons.

Some items marked as obsolete are refurbished and sold to collectors through the Civilian Marksmanship Program in Anniston. Even some of the Captain Crunch operators, many of whom are gun enthusiasts in addition to gun destroyers, get a kick out of seeing some of the older weapons.

Its like Christmas, property disposal specialist Jerrod Kirkpatrick said in a 2011 article for the Armys website. You open up a box and say, Ive never seen this before. What is this?",[]

It's the best phone you can buy, and there are plenty of reasons to consider it if you're shopping for high-end Android smartphones. But what Samsung sold as a main feature of the new Galaxy S7 might prove to be the most disappointing thing about the phone.

DON'T MISS: Galaxy S7 review roundup: Samsung has made a masterpiece

Leaks preceding the Galaxy S7 announcement suggested both new S7 handsets will pack significantly bigger batteries than their predecessors, which Samsung confirmed on stage. Rumors also said the Galaxy S7 models could offer up to two days of battery life. Samsung talked about faster wireless charging and teased that you could watch a full season of Game of Thrones on a single charge, though it didn't confirm those battery life claims when it unveiled the phones.

Meanwhile, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge are finally available in stores in some regions and Phone Arena put both devices through its usual battery life tests.

Surprisingly, neither phone would get you through a full season of Game of Thrones. Even more annoyingly, the Galaxy S7 did worse than the Galaxy S6, and came behind the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus as well.

The Galaxy S7 edge, which has a bigger battery, barely outperformed the Galaxy S6, trailing almost two hours behind the iPhone 6s Plus, the Galaxy Note 5 and more than two hours behind the Galaxy S6 edge+.

Finally, it should be pointed out that both handsets that Phone Arena got to play with packed Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processors, so it's not clear what kind of battery life the Exynos 8890 models can offer. That chipset will only be available outside the U.S., however.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-05 00:00:00,Researchers report Zika virus can threaten babies at any stage of pregnancy,[],"Researchers report that the Zika virus may be linked to a wider variety of ""grave outcomes"" for developing babies than previously reported  threats that can come at any stage of pregnancy.

The findings released Friday are preliminary results from the first study tracking pregnant women in Brazil from the time they were infected, and do not prove that Zika is to blame. But they come as separate laboratory research released Friday strengthens the case that Zika causes a serious birth defect called microcephaly  babies born with abnormally small heads  by targeting embryonic brain cells.

""It's much more than microcephaly,"" said Dr. Karin Nielsen of the University of California, Los Angeles, who led the pregnancy study with colleagues at the Fiocruz Institute in Brazil. ""It seems like it can act on multiple fronts.""

The mosquito-borne virus, which is spreading in Latin America and the Caribbean, normally causes only mild symptoms, if any, in adults. But it raised alarm when Brazilian health officials reported an apparent surge in babies born with microcephaly, which can signal their brains didn't develop properly. Reports have documented traces of the virus in the brains of affected babies who died soon after birth, and in fetal brain tissue after abortion.

The study from Brazil, reported Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, took a closer look during pregnancy.

The study so far is tracking 88 otherwise healthy pregnant women who sought care for Zika-like symptoms at a clinic run by the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janiero between September and last month. Tests showed 72 were actively infected with the virus. Forty-two of the infected women, and all of the presumably non-infected ones, agreed to fetal ultrasound exams. Those ultrasounds found abnormalities in 12 of the infected women, or 29 percent. The non-infected women all had normal ultrasounds.

The exams did uncover some abnormal brain development. But they also detected two fetuses that died in utero during the last trimester; poor growth even without microcephaly; problems with the placenta; and one case that prompted an emergency C-section because of low amniotic fluid, Nielsen said.

Six live births have occurred so far. One baby has severe microcephaly. Two were born too small for gestational age, one of whom had lesions in the eyes that signal vision problems if not blindness. Two other babies had normal ultrasounds and indeed, appear healthy. The baby delivered by emergency C-section struggled initially but now also appears healthy, Nielsen said.

Importantly, the researchers linked problems to infections during each trimester of pregnancy, not just the first trimester that doctors have speculated would be the riskiest.

""Unfortunately, we still have many unanswered questions,"" said Dr. Christopher M. Zahn of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But the new findings provide ""additional evidence suggesting an association between Zika virus and negative obstetrical outcomes, including birth defects and fetal demise.""

""We're starting to build the case epidemiologically that maternal infection with this virus is linked to poor fetal outcomes,"" added Dr. Sallie Permar, a specialist in maternal-fetal infections at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.

In an unrelated study Friday, researchers found that Zika can infect embryonic cells that help form the brain, and harm them in two ways: killing some outright and damaging the ability of others to divide and grow in number.

Those cells, when healthy, help build the part of the brain that is affected in microcephaly, said Hengli Tang of Florida State University, a lead author of the work published by the journal Cell Stem Cell. But he stressed that his study does not prove that Zika causes microcephaly, nor that it works by that route. A number of other viruses are known to trigger the condition.

Researchers did not take the brain cells from embryos; they created them from stem cells obtained from other sources.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who did not participate in the research, agreed that the study doesn't prove a link. But ""it certainly adds weight to the argument,"" he said.

Researchers also found that infected cells pump out more virus.

Dr. Guo-li Ming of Johns Hopkins University, another lead study author, said researchers can now explore questions like how Zika infects the cells.

Tang said he is collaborating with other labs to look for substances that will block Zika infection of cells, in hopes of eventually creating a treatment for pregnant women that reduces the risk of passing the infection to their babies.

Follow on Twitter, Facebook, listen free/live on foxnewsradio app

Today Ted Cruz got Carly Fiorinas endorsement while campaigning in Florida to put a stake in the heart of the Rubio campaign.

Cruz is counting on a one on one race with Donald Trump, and he is doing what Ted Cruz has always done: pitch conservative values. He is trying, obviously, to draw votes away from Donald Trump with his conservative message.

Cruz is looking at the vote totals from Michigan and Mississippi. Take Michigan: Trump got 481,657votes, while Cruz and Kasich and the doomed Marco Rubio got a combined 772,260 votes.

Taking that one state as an example of the nation as a whole, Cruz thinks a conservative message will draw off the Rubio and Kasich votes and he will ultimately beat Trump.

But that theory depends on the notion that present day Republican voters are as dedicated to notions of conservatism that Cruz trumpets repeatedly, relying on the same notes played over and over and over.

But there is now some thinking among freaked out conservative warriors that maybe the Republican electorate doesnt care that much about conservative boilerplate as they once did. And that the reason is Donald Trump.

Jonah Goldberg, a passionate Trump opponent, has spotted this trend. In a piece in the Los Angeles Times today he notes that the GOP once had the attitude better to be right and lose axiom  hence Goldwaters disastrous defeat in 1964. Now we seem to have tipped in the other direction, thinking its better to be wrong and win.

To be sure, Jonah does not think this is the right way to proceed. He and other name brand conservatives are worried that Trump will set back the conservative movement by representing the Republican party with positions borrowed directly from Liberals and Democrats, such as support for Planned Parenthood and what sounds an awful lot like universal health care.

Probably true. But this around it may not matter.

The Wall Street Journal identified another force at work in this primary season: the same people are driving the success of both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, namely the angry white man.

The Journals analysis is that these voters are coming out of the woodwork for the same reason, which is free trade deals that have left them behind in the economy.

The author, Gerry Seib, figures it this way:

When voters were asked in Michigan whether trade with other countries creates jobs or takes away jobs, just over half of GOP respondents said it takes away jobsthis is in the Republican Party that once was the bastion of strong belief in free trade. And among those who see trade as a job killer, Mr. Trump won going away, 42% to 23% for Mr. Cruz.

Heres a bit more evidence that the Trump army is made up of people angry over the belief the economy has left them behind: Among white college graduates in Michigan, he lost to Mr. Kasich. But among whites without a college degree, he won by almost 20 percentage points.

Perhaps more interesting, angry white males are sustaining the Sanders campaign, not just the Trump campaign.

So while all kinds of people argue that Trump cannot bring in Cruz voters, Rubio voters, or Kasich voters, its worth considering the possibility that he indeed can.

And frightening as it may be to Democrats and Hillary Clinton, what if some of those Bernie voters are actually Trump voters in-waiting?",[]

Ellenhorn is a student senator at USC and president of the College Republicans. He is also an outspoken conservative.

Click here to join Todds American Dispatch: a must-read for Conservatives!

And thats a big problem among his fellow student lawmakers at USC.

Ellenhorn is facing possible impeachment  accused of all sorts of tawdry behavior  like publicly expressing his conservative opinions and (brace yourself) inviting high-profile conservative speakers to campus.

It seems like freedom of speech and freedom to express your views is not allowed by the University of Southern California student government right now, he told me.

Ellenhorn accused liberal students of engaging in a witch hunt and committing institutionalized discrimination against me and my views.

If you voice a difference of opinion on any small issue  they lash out at you, he told me. Youre a racist, youre a homophobe, youre anti-woman, youre sexist. This is ridiculous.

The official complaint, first reported by Campus Reform, alleges that Ellenhorn created a hostile environments (sic) for our USC study body, and has also violated our USC Principles of Community by bringing a speaker and moderating an event that blatantly perpetuates sexism.

The Lefties were especially troubled when Ellenhorn invited Milo Yiannopoulos to speak last year.

PODCAST: Listen to Todds indepth interview with Jacob Ellenhorn

Stephen Smith, an adjunct professor and executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation, accused Yiannopoulos of being known for his anti-feminist and more broadly misogynist commentary.

Harmful speech has no place in the Trojan community, Smith wrote in a letter calling for Yiannopoulos to be disinvited.

Whatever Yiannopoulos has to say on campus, his invitation here calls into question the human values as well as the academic standards of the USC College republicans, he wrote. Controversial celebrity presenters may draw an audience, but the integrity of the USC College Republicans is rubbished by such content, the high standards of excellence we all try to uphold at USC are undermined, and the USC community as a whole is deeply offended on behalf of its women students, staff and faculty.

Ellenhorn admits that hes invited firebrand speakers like Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro.

They are claiming that because I invited them  I made students on campus feel unsafe, he said. No one has to listen to them. No one was forced to attend. For goodness sake  were adults. We should be able to handle other peoples opinions.

Senators are expected to hold hearings later this month to determine the young conservatives fate. But Ellenhorn doesnt seem to be all that intimidated.

He penned a fiery response to the complaint  accusing University Student Government of trying to castrate strong male voices into submission.

Bold.

Now, you might be wondering why Im dedicating this column to covering what some might consider a silly campus skirmish. But this is no silly skirmish.

Pew Research did a study a few months ago  revealing that 40 percent of millennials believe there should be limitations on free speech. Thats a disturbing number.

I suspect that our public universities are being used to foster such anti-American thinking. The Left isnt just opposing dissenting viewpoints. They are trying to silence opposing viewpoints.

Ellenhorn told me hes seen his fellow senators rant about all sorts of outrageous issues  but hes never tried to silence anyone. Hes never tried to have his opposition impeached.

Difference of opinion should be triumphed, he said. But what they are trying to do is shut difference of opinion down.

And they are in for a mighty big fight.

Im not going to stand down, he said. Im going to stand up. Im not going to be quiet.

United Continental says its President and CEO Oscar Munoz will return to his roles at the airline full-time later this month.

Munoz took medical leave after suffering a heart attack in October, just six weeks after replacing Jeff Smisek, who was forced to resign, as CEO. He then had a heart transplant in January.

The airline said Sunday that Munoz has already been participating actively in all major corporate decisions and meeting frequently with employees, shareholders, and other stakeholders during his recovery. He will return to his duties on a full-time basis March 14.

Chicago-based United Continental Holdings Inc. is the nation's third-biggest airline by traffic, trailing American and Delta.

Before taking the helm at United Continental, Munoz served as president and chief operating officer of CSX Corp. He joined the United Continental board in 2010. He has worked also worked at AT&T, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, where he told Hispanic Executive that he ""engineered successful turnarounds. He has also been involved in a number of philanthropic organizations, including the the American Cancer Society and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

The brainchild of U.K.-based OpenWorks Engineering, SkyWall 100 uses a compressed air launcher to fire smart projectiles at targeted drones.

The system, which has a range of 328 feet, uses a high-tech scope to lock on to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). An onboard computer then tracks the targets flight path and calculates the trajectory required for the projectile to intercept either a hovering or flying drone.

The canister-style projectile opens up when it reaches the drone and uses a net to capture the flying device. The projectile then deploys a parachute to bring the captured drone and the canister components safely back to the ground.

OpenWorks Engineering believes that physically capturing a drone can be extremely useful for law enforcement. Once captured it can be impounded, forensically investigated or simply handed back with some words of education where appropriate, it explained, in a statement, adding that the risk of damaging the drone is also reduced.

""I wouldn't recommend anyone try to outrun a volcano, but there's a few of us that could,"" said Greg Valentine, a volcanologist at the University at Buffalo in New York.

By analyzing rocks trapped in volcanic ash, Valentine and his colleagues discovered the lethal ash flow spread at street speeds  about 10 to 45 mph. It might be hard to sustain this pace on foot, but it's certainly possible by car. [Big Blasts: History's 10 Most Destructive Volcanoes]

The findings were published March 7 in the journal Nature Communications.

""It's really interesting how you can have such a violent eruption producing such slow-moving flows,"" said Valentine, co-author of the new study. ""They still devastate a huge area, but they're slow and concentrated and dense,"" he told Live Science. His collaborators include Olivier Roche, of Blaise Pascal University in France and David Buesch, of the U.S. Geological Survey.

Of course, the safest way to deal with any rumbling volcano is to get as far away as possible. Lots of distance can prevent the most common cause of death associated with volcanoes: being trapped and suffocated by a torrent of ash, rocks and superhot gas that explode out at speeds of up to 300 mph. These ""pyroclastic flows"" are the real volcanic killer, not lava. A pyroclastic flow wiped out the Roman town of Pompeii, and in 1902, Mount Pelee on Martinique unleashed a pyroclastic flow that killed some 29,000 people. [Preserved Pompeii: Photos Reveal City of Ash]

You should still evacuate

Volcanologists try to account for such hazards when planning for future disasters. But it's hard to know what will happen when a supervolcano the size of Yellowstone blows its top. The last supereruption on Earth was 74,000 years ago, in Toba, Indonesia. Looking at the rocky remains of past supereruptions can reveal how and why supervolcanoes erupt.

When a supervolcano blew in Arizona 18.8 million years ago, the ash spread more than 100 miles. This single layer, called the Peach Springs Tuff, is more than 450 feet thick in the area close to the volcano and 10 feet thick at its edge, 100 miles away. (A tuff is a volcanic rock made of solidified ash.)

The researchers measured rocks at the bottom of the tuff in Arizona that were carried in the flow. They matched unique rock types back to their source, and found that many of the rocks, whether fist-size or boulders, were carried no farther than a football field.

Accounting for the size and position of these rocks helped the researchers build a model of how fast and thick the ash flow was as it traveled. It turns out that only a dense, slow-moving pyroclastic flow could suck up the rocks from the surface and trundle them along. A fast, relatively thin flow would have to reach impossible speeds  up to 1,454 mph  to carry the rocks, the researchers found.

""I think it's plausible but speculative,"" said Calvin Miller, a volcanologist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, who was not involved in the study. ""It will be interesting to see how the [scientific] community responds to it. Even if they're right for the Peach Springs Tuff, this is just part of a continuum of eruption styles,"" Miller told Live Science.

The origins of the Peach Springs Tuff can be spotted in southwestern Arizona's Black Mountains, near the town of Oatman. The eruption left behind a very large crater called a caldera, though it has been mostly obliterated by erosion and faulting.

The caldera, called Silver Creek, spewed magma for several days, releasing a volume of about 1,000 times the Mississippi River's daily flow at New Orleans, Valentine said. ""If you think about 1,000 Mississippi Rivers coming out of the ground, you can see how [the ash] would have spread out across a huge area,"" he said.

However, one expert on the Peach Springs Tuff doesn't buy the scenario. Charles Ferguson, a research geologist with the Arizona Geological Survey, said there are outcrops that suggest the ash moved quickly and energetically, like a typical pyroclastic flow.

""I think their hypothesis is more problematic than explanatory,"" Ferguson told Live Science.

Southwestern supervolcanoes

The Peach Springs Tuff covers parts of Arizona, Nevada and California, from Barstow, California, to Peach Springs, Arizona. Geologists use the creamy white and pink rock as a unique marker in the region.

The western United States suffered at least 100 of these huge eruptions starting about 40 million years ago (a consequence of shifting tectonic plates). It's not clear whether every one of these supervolcanic blasts sent out slowly moving ash flows, but Valentine said he sees similar evidence in other areas.

The powerful Peach Springs eruption ejected 72 cubic miles of pulverized rock into the air. For comparison, the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington blasted out 0.24 cubic miles of material. And the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines spewed 2.4 cubic miles of material.

Any supereruption will likely come with a fair amount of warning, similar to the bulge that foreshadowed the Mount St. Helens eruption. The new findings suggest that people living near a supervolcano might have a few hours to evacuate once the disaster starts, the researchers said.

James Ryan was convicted in February in the death of Nassau County Officer James Olivieri in October 2012. Prosecutors said Ryan's reckless driving caused the chain-reaction crash that killed Olivieri.

The case was watched closely by legal experts, who said it was rare for someone other than a driver directly involved in a crash to be charged. The charges were based on the legal principle of ""causation/foreseeability,"" in which suspects are charged in events that are foreseeable results of their actions.

A jury found the 28-year-old Ryan guilty of 10 of 13 charges but acquitted him of the most serious one -- aggravated vehicular homicide. He was convicted on charges including aggravated criminally negligent homicide, vehicular manslaughter, drunken driving and reckless endangerment.

Ryan's Toyota hit a BMW on the Long Island Expressway after Ryan spent a night drinking in New York City. He then was hit by another car after stopping 1,500 yards down the highway. A few minutes later, an SUV driver smashed into Ryan's car before hitting Olivieri, who was out of his patrol vehicle talking to Ryan.

During the trial, defense attorney Marc Gann conceded his client had been drinking and had a blood-alcohol level of 0.13, which is higher than the state's threshold of 0.08. But the attorney said the SUV driver failed to avoid crashing into the wreckage from Ryan's earlier accident. That driver was never charged.

In one such case from 1994, a New York City man was convicted of murder in the death of an officer who had been chasing after him in a robbery investigation and fell to his death through a skylight.

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Ray strengthens case for rotation spot,[],"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- Robbie Ray started the spring with a bit of a leg up to be the Diamondbacks' fifth starter and the left-handed has only strengthened his position since.

That continued Tuesday evening, when Ray threw three shutout innings in a 5-3 loss to the Angles at Salt River Fields.

""I'm seeing progress,"" said Ray, who struck out three and gave up two hits and a walk. ""I'm getting better every time out, just fine tuning things.""

Manager Chip Hale likes the idea of competition in spring training. The fifth-starter's job is just that, he says. General Manager Dave Stewart, however, continually lists Ray among the four other pitches Hale already named to the rotation -- Zack Greinke, Patrick Corbin, Shelby Miller and Rubby De La Rosa.

Ray, for his part, has done nothing but solidify his standing. He has six strikeouts and three hits allowed in five innings. Archie Bradley and Zack Godley, Ray's primary competition at the start of camp, haven't quite kept up.

""It's just another day at the ballpark,"" Ray said when asked about competing for a spot on the Opening Day roster. ""I just go out and do my job. I know what I need to do and I just go out and do it.

Pitch efficiency is a point of emphasis this spring for Ray, who needed 50 pitches to get through Tuesday's three innings. His change-up against a heavily right-handed Angels lineup helped in that.

""The main thing today was staying around the zone,"" he said. ""I was able to get quick outs and work out of those big counts.

""All my pitches were working. I was pitching inside and (my) off-speed stuff I was happy with. It was breaking away and out of the zone.""

Human rights defender Amnesty International says officials have made mistakes in the investigation into the killing of a Honduran indigenous leader and environmentalist.

Erika Guevara, Americas director for the organization, said Tuesday that investigators have not tried to get statements from people the 45-year-old Berta Caceres had accused of threatening her. She also said authorities had not agreed to Caceres' family's request to use independent forensic experts.

Guevara said the only witness to the March 3 attack, Mexican activist Gustavo Caceres, was in danger because authorities won't let him return to Mexico. He was wounded but survived by playing dead.

Caceres, who was awarded the 2015 Goldman Environmental Prize for her role in fighting a dam project, had complained of death threats from police, the army and landowners' groups.

foxnews.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,"Despite success, Zidane on permanent hot seat at senseless Real Madrid",[],"Any sane club would look at their undisputed legend, now manager, who they appointed despite his having no prior experience leading a first team, and give him at least a year, if not two, to prove that he was up to the job. The concept of firing him, barring an unimaginable collapse, would be laughable.

Real Madrid are not a sane club. They are, well, Real Madrid.

Zinedine Zidane was one of the best players of all time and the face of the club for years. He transitioned to management at the club, at the behest of Jose Mourinho, became their sporting director and then their academy team coach. He took every step, learned the entire way and had the support of some of the brightest men in the sport. It was only a matter of time before he was going to be put in charge of the first team and when Rafa Benitez was sacked, he got his chance -- he was handed the keys to one of the biggest clubs in the world.

Still, despite his inexperience, an unbalanced team that club president Florentino Perez has bastardized for years and having to clean up the mess left by Benitez, Zidane won't be afforded time to learn on the job or rebuild a broken squad. He is the manager of Real Madrid and, as such, he is on the hot seat, as was every Real Madrid manager before him.

The La Liga title slipped away long ago. They may only be 12 points back of first place Barcelona, but when you're chasing the Catalonian juggernaut, 12 points might as well be 24. Los Blancos also have Atletico Madrid providing a buffer between the El Clasico rivals, so it's not even a matter of simply chasing Lionel Messi and Co. The league is gone, and it was before Zidane even took the reins.

Of course, Zidane doesn't have the Copa del Rey to chase either. The Merengues were eliminated from that when Benitez and the rest of the club weren't aware that Denis Cheryshev was supposed to be suspended in the competition and played him in the round of 32, earning the club an automatic elimination.

All Zidane has now is the Champions League. It is the only competition he was handed a generally clean slate in with a fair chance to even compete for the title. And because he is at Real Madrid, he may need to make a good run at the European title to enter next season with any sort of support from Perez, the ax-wielding star-chaser calling the shots at the Bernabeu with seemingly no concept of building a functioning soccer team.

Things have gone well so far, with Real Madrid winning the first leg of their round of 16 tie, 2-0. Now they're set to play Roma in the second leg (Tuesday, 2:45 p.m. ET on FS1, FSGO) with a foot in the quarterfinals. But simply making the quarterfinals isn't always enough at the Bernabeu. They must thrill en route to that round and, if they go out at that stage, there can't be any sort of embarrassment in it.

That is what Zidane has been tasked with and why, even up heading into the second leg, he needs Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and the rest of the Merengues to put forward a great performance. Simply winning isn't enough, even for a manager who wasn't given a chance to win in two competitions.

Zidane's Real Madrid have lost just one of 11 matches and he has united a squad that was anything but under Benitez. Right now, there is nothing but optimism at the club -- at least with regards to Zidane's stewardship -- and support for Perez's ridiculousness seems to be waning, but Real Madrid haven't lost their identity. They are a club without patience, and that won't change for Zidane.

After all, the Merengues fired Carlo Ancelotti a year after he won the Champions League in 2014, an incredible accomplishment considering he was handed an ill-fitting team that lacked a capable tackling midfielder or anything resembling a plan. Perez's failures were taken out on Ancelloti and the Italian was blamed for not winning a trophy the season following his European triumph, considered sacrilege at the Bernabeu, and this despite the fact that Benitez was lined up as his successor.

Nearly a year later, it is still impossible to comprehend -- a big, powerful club capable of hiring the best and brightest minds, fired Ancelotti to hire Benitez.

That is the club where Zidane is the leader, or at least that's what is perceived. In reality, Perez runs things and, as such, Zidane has pressure to perform. It doesn't matter the circumstances or the various reasons a fair evaluation is at least months away.

Zidane needs to win. He needs to thrill. He needs to do it in the Champions League and he needs to do it now, or he may not be at the Bernabeu in a year's time.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Miami Dolphins hold tryouts for new cheerleaders...in soccer-crazed Latin America,[],"Leaving one of the poorest cities in Brazil at 5 a.m., 20-year-old student Luciane Lima traveled from Sao Goncalo to a Copacabana hotel two hours away to join 300 women at an unusual audition in the land of soccer: Cheerleader for the NFL's Miami Dolphins.

The Dolphins started auditions last week, and is targeting soccer-crazy countries such as Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Mexico. Although few of the Brazilian candidates knew much about the sport, they found out about the trials via social media and flocked to the tryouts.

In exchange for injecting a touch of samba into the Dolphins' cheerleading team, they hope to start new lives in the United States.

Lima was raised without her parents and says dancing saved her life. She was among many coming from poor regions where they could never work as dancers.

""I haven't slept because I was so anxious,"" said Lima, dressed in a yellow outfit. ""But all this hard work is worth it because just being here is a huge emotion.""

For 21-year-old student Ana Priscilla Duarte, who enjoys dancing as a hobby, just getting to the second round was a shock.

""Every girl sees (cheerleaders) in the movies,"" she said, and laughed when asked about her knowledge of the NFL.

""I will have to study a bit if I get this opportunity,"" said Duarte, who like Lima didn't make the final selection.

While football is a growing sport in Brazil, it's still nowhere near the popularity of soccer and volleyball.

Ballerina Nadine Santos, 22, stood out as a genuine Dolphins fan.

""Soccer and football are totally different. You can see that when teams come out to play,"" said Santos, who started watching NFL games three years ago. ""Soccer is very outdated to come onto the pitch, with kids hand in hand with the players. Brazil could have cheerleaders.""

Santos didn't make the final six picked from Rio to go to the finals in Miami on May 1. All of them had to be at least 18 years old, enrolled in high school until June and with a valid passport. Miami Dolphins cheerleaders have traveled to more than 30 countries on five continents over the past decade.

Dolphins senior director of entertainment Dorie Grogan told The Associated Press that she wants to create a true international cheerleading squad.

""We selected locations where we have already had cheerleaders in the past,"" Grogan said. ""We hope to expand it if it works out.""

Grogan said those chosen would have to commit to living in Miami for a minimum of nine months.

""We have a full process to get them settled in Miami,"" she said. ""We'll assist them in housing and transportation.""

Miami's cheerleading team has 32 to 36 women.

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Dos Anjos: Diaz's heart turned McGregor from a lion to a cat,[],"Rafael dos Anjos isn't exactly Conor McGregor's biggest fan. After all, McGregor was set to challenge the lightweight champion last week at UFC 196 for his belt and lobbed plenty of insults his way beforehand.

However, dos Anjos admitted Monday to the MMA Hour that he did believe McGregor would beat his last-minute replacement Nate Diaz. Dos Anjos says that McGregor chose Diaz as an opponent, in large part, because he was not training -- in fact, Diaz says he was vacationing in Mexico when he got the call, and not training for an unnamed triathlon the way UFC president Dana White strangely told the world he was.

""Honestly, to tell you the truth, I thought [McGregor] would win,"" dos Anjos said.

""He did his best because he had a lot of guys offer to fight him [like] Anthony Pettis, Donald Cerrone -- guys [who were] in shape, guys in fight camps. So he picked Nate Diaz, who wasn't training, for sure. Like [Diaz] said, he didn't spar once for this fight. And he submitted him. So [McGregor] picked the easiest one on his mind, that's why I thought he was going to win.""

With that said, dos Anjos knows exactly how hard-nosed a fighter Diaz is. In 2014, dos Anjos dominated Diaz but could not finish him.

The difference at UFC 196, according to dos Anjos, was Diaz's heart vs. McGregor's heart. ""Nate Diaz is a tough opponent. I've fought him,"" he recounted.

""He's a really hard guy to finish, has a lot of heart, but he's different than Conor. Conor did not show a lot of heart. He's a lion when he's punching somebody, but when he's getting punched he becomes a cat -- A little cat. When he's punching somebody, he's a lion. But when people punch him he becomes a cat.""",[]
foxnews.com,2016-01-26 00:00:00,Sexy signal? Frill and horns may have helped dinosaur communicate,[],"The fancy frill and cheek horns that adorned the head of a triceratops relative may have helped the dinosaur communicate, possibly acting as a social or sexy signal, a new study suggests.

This isn't the first time researchers have analyzed the skull of Protoceratops andrewsi, a sheep-size dinosaur with four legs that dates to the Cretaceous period, about 75 million years ago. Protoceratops andrewsi lived just before Triceratops, and paleontologists regularly come across their fossilized remains in Mongolia.

As researchers collected more specimens over the years, they noticed a peculiar pattern: The frill was absent in juveniles, but it quickly grew disproportionately larger in relation to the dinosaur's size in adulthood. [Tiny & Old: Images of 'Triceratops' Ancestors]

This sudden burst in frill growth suggests that 6.5-foot-long P. andrewsi used the structure as a signal, possible to convey its dominance and age, and maybe even serve as a sexual sign, the researchers said.

""Paleontologistshave long suspected that many of the strange features we see in dinosaurs were linked to sexual display and social dominance, but this is very hard to show,"" study lead author David Hone, a lecturer of zoology at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), said in a statement. ""The growth pattern we see in Protoceratops matches that seen for signaling structures in numerous different living species and forms a coherent pattern from very young animals right through to large adults.""

To investigate, the researchers measured how the frill changed in length and width in 37 dinosaurs over four life stages, including hatchling babies, young animals, near-adults and adults. The frill changed in size, as well as shape, becoming proportionally wider as the dinosaur grew up, they noted.

The dinosaur's cheek horns also grew larger with age, but they did not grow as much as the frills, according to the study. This finding suggests that P. andrewsiused its cheek horns for signaling as well, but more evidence is needed to confirm that idea.

""Biologists are increasingly realizing that sexual selection is a massively important force in shaping biodiversity both now and in the past,"" said study co-author Rob Knell, a professor of evolutionary ecology at QMUL.

""Not only does sexual selection account for most of the stranger, prettier and more impressive features that we see in the animal kingdom, [but] it also seems to play a part in determining how new species arise,"" Knell said. ""And there is increasing evidence that it also has effects on extinction rates and on the ways by which animals are able to adapt to changing environments.""

The study raises some interesting and compelling interpretations of P. andrewsi's frills and cheek horns, said Andrew Farke, a paleontologist at the Raymond M. Alf Museum of Paleontology in Claremont, California, who was not involved in the new research.

""I would suspect that there is some sort of role in reproduction for this, if it's the adults that are showing the biggest size of this, it makes sense,"" Farke told Live Science. ""On the other hand, it's also likely that it could just be for how old are you relative to the next animal, so who gets to the food first?""

The study was published online Jan. 13 in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Dodgers might have to get creative with their rotation this season,[],"The depth of the Dodgers' rotation remains a question, even in certain quarters of the team's clubhouse. The club's front office, though, remains confident in its internal options, and one rival executive flatly dismissed any concerns Tuesday, saying, ""They're going to win the division.""

The path, though, might be unusual, particularly in year one A.G. (after Greinke).

Left-hander Brett Anderson already is out 3 to 5 months after undergoing back surgery. Three other starters -- lefty Hyun-Jin Ryu and righties Brandon McCarthy and Frankie Montas -- are in various states of disrepair. And a number of the team's healthy starters represent injury risks.

Barring further problems, the Dodgers will open the season with lefties Clayton Kershaw, Scott Kazmir and Alex Wood and righty Kenta Maeda as their top four starters, with one of three righties -- Mike Bolsinger, Brandon Beachy or Carlos Frias -- in the fifth spot.

The team also is not ruling out the possibility of promoting a top prospect such as lefty Julio Urias or righty Jose De Leon in the first half, if necessary. Workload would be a concern for such young pitchers, but the Dodgers' rationale is that Ryu, McCarthy and Anderson all could return by the second half, enabling the club to save innings with the youngsters later.

One problem: Urias, 19, and De Leon, 23, pitched on strict limits last season, averaging fewer innings than five per start. The Dodgers, though, would not expect either to go deep into games. Righty Joe Blanton will serve as a true long man, giving the club a weapon it lacked last season.

Besides, Urias and De Leon will not be the only available options at Triple A -- righties Ross Stripling, Zach Lee and Jharel Cotton are all capable of contributing, club officials believe. And if all else fails, the team always could trade for a starter in July.

Most teams generally get between 900 and 1,000 innings out of their starters. The Dodgers certainly do not lack candidates to help them reach that level. Healthy candidates, that's another question. Effective candidates, another one still.

Welcome to year one, A.G.

IAN'S IMMEDIATE IMPRESSION

Ian Desmond has yet to field a flyball in Cactus League play, but the Rangers already are excited by his potential in left field.

""When you watch him in batting practice, his reads are smooth,"" manager Jeff Banister said. ""You would never guess this guy hasn't played left field.""

Banister cited a play from Sunday's game against the Mariners as evidence that Desmond actually might prove a difference-maker in left.

With the Mariners' Shawn O'Malley on second, Nori Aoki hit a hard smash that bounced off the glove of Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus. Desmond charged the ball in a dead sprint, then unleashed a powerful throw home. O'Malley might have been out, but catcher Chris Gimenez had vacated the plate, moving up to take Desmond's throw.

""The ball tipped off Elvis' glove into short left-center,"" Gimenez said. ""(Desmond) got to it and threw an absolute laser beam to me at the plate, but I was up above the plate already. Once I saw the ball go off Elvis' glove I was pointing for him to throw it second -- I thought the run would score easy.

""After that throw, I think he will have zero problems out there. What an athlete.""

REGRETS, THEY MIGHT HAVE A FEW

If Desmond proves a success, several teams might ponder what might have been -- and we're not talking about the Cardinals, who never could have anticipated shortstop Jhonny Peralta's thumb injury.

According to major-league soruces, the Giants showed interest in Desmond playing left field and becoming their version of Ben Zobrist before signing free-agent center fielder Denard Span to a three-year, $31 million contract in early January.

The Orioles showed late interest, sources said, but Desmond viewed the Rangers as a better fit, signing with them for one year, $8 million.

A RARE MISFIRE BY ORIOLES' DUQUETTE

Orioles GM Dan Duquette has had prior success waiting out the market, most notably with outfielder Nelson Cruz, whom he signed to a one-year, $8 million free-agent contract in Feb. 2014.

His strategy was not as successful this offseason.

Duquette succeeded in keeping several of his own free agents and held out for a two-year, $22 million bargain on right-hander Yovani Gallardo. But he effectively struck out in his late search for a corner outfielder, reaching agreement with designated hitter Pedro Alvarez to a one-year, $5.75 million contract after missing on Desmond, Dexter Fowler and Austin Jackson and passing on Marlon Byrd, Alex Rios and the Reds' Jay Bruce.

Fowler, of course, went to the Cubs on a one-year, $13 million deal after declining to complete a three-year agreement with the Orioles. Jackson signed a one-year, $5 million contract with the White Sox, preferring to play center, where the Orioles already have Adam Jones.

Alvarez's left-handed power should play well at Camden Yards, but the added value from his offense could be negated by Mark Trumbo's below-average defense in right field. Trumbo figures to play right against right-handers, with some combination of Nolan Reimold, Dariel Alvarez and Rule 5 pick Joey Rickard playing right against lefties.

The Orioles still lack an outfielder who occasionally can spell Jones in center, a role that they intended Fowler or Jackson to fill.

ROSTER CRUNCH IN OAKLAND

An excess of quality position players generally is not a problem for the low-revenue Athletics, but recent trades for outfielder Khris Davis, infielder/outfielder Chris Coghlan and the seeming revival of Coco Crisp is making for a crowded roster.

Injuries, of course, can and probably will alter the equation. But the outfield mix also includes Josh Reddick, Billy Burns and Sam Fuld, plus Mark Canha and Andrew Lambo, both of whom also play first base. Some A's officials believe that Lambo could be the next Brandon Moss, but where will he play? Yonder Alonso is the principal option at first.

In any case, the surplus of outfielders could force the A's to use Coghlan primarily as a $4.8 million backup infielder, jeopardizing the spot of Eric Sogard, a valuable defender for a team with questionable infield defense up the middle.

Billy Butler also is clogging the roster as the full-time DH; the Athletics owe Butler $20 million over the next two seasons, and have been unable to trade him. A revival by Crisp in the final year of his guaranteed contract would further complicate matters.

Crisp, 36, was running on a 3-2 count Sunday when he scored from first on a single to right-center, prompting general manager David Forst to remark, ""He looked five years younger, at least.""

Forst acknowledged that while it will be tempting to give Crisp regular at-bats, the Athletics will need to stay disciplined with him to keep him from breaking down.

Burns, like Sogard, has minor-league options remaining. But it's difficult to imagine the A's demoting Burns, who finished fifth last season in the balloting for American League Rookie of the Year.

Fuld would appear a more likely candidate to get bumped; he is set to earn $1.925 million, but his contract is not guaranteed.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,JetBlue launches program to train novice pilots,[],"JetBlue Airways is taking applications for 24 slots in a new program to train novice pilots to fly a passenger jet.

The airline said Monday that the program  the first of its kind at a large U.S. airline  will cost about $125,000 and take four years to complete. Graduates could wind up flying 100-seat passenger jets.

Warren Christie, JetBlue's senior vice president of safety and training, say the program won't replace the airline's traditional pipelines for pilots, many of whom come from smaller airlines. JetBlue hired more than 300 pilots last year, and a group of 30 new hires just started training last week, he said.

No Aviation Experience Necessary For JetBlue Pilot Training Program

CBS Chicago

Applicants will be judged with tests measuring hand-eye coordination, multitasking, critical thinking and other skills. Those who survive the first cut will be interviewed.

There also will be a ""personality assessment"" but not psychological screening, Christie said. The debate over psychological screening has increased since a Germanwings pilot intentionally crashed a plane last year in France, killing 150 people.

JetBlue expects the first group of six prospects to begin training in late summer at the airline's training center in Florida. JetBlue hired CAE, a maker of flight simulators, to provide the training. CAE has run similar programs for EasyJet and Ryanair in Europe and several airlines in Asia.

Christie believes the program will open the profession to more people. The trainees will meet all federal requirements before carrying passengers, he said.

""They will absolutely be as qualified as any other pilot that is operating a JetBlue aircraft,"" he said.

Taking a page from programs in Europe, the students will start training with other crew members in a cockpit or simulator much earlier than usual, according to JetBlue and CAE. Currently, some new U.S. pilots learn by dusting crops or toting advertising banners  experience that may bear little resemblance to working in an airliner cockpit.

Despite Dual Malaysia Airlines Disasters, Still Safest Period of Air Travel

The applicants will pay for their own training, and the cost is not much different from the amount that many aspiring pilots now spend to accumulate the 1,500 flight hours necessary for an airline pilot's license.

Christie said the students will be able to defray some of their costs by earning a salary as a CAE instructor for part of their training period. CAE described the salary as ""competitive"" without providing specifics.

Nick Leontidis, president of CAE's training business, said students who struggle will be flagged for remedial training and, failing that, expulsion. But washout rates in similar programs at other airlines have been ""extremely low,"" he said.

""We believe this is going to be an important part of how airlines are going to create pilots in the future,"" Leontidis said.

The pilots' union at JetBlue pilots opposes the plan. Jim Bigham, chairman of the union's council, said JetBlue should instead hire pilots with experience at regional airlines who currently get passed over.

Bigham said he is not against training newcomers to the field, ""but when they come out, I want them to go gain some real-world airline experience prior to becoming an apprentice at JetBlue.""",[]

Private space travel company Blue Origin expects its first test flights with people in 2017, company founder Jeff Bezos said during a tour of the venture's research and development site outside Seattle.

And Bezos said Tuesday that thousands of people have expressed interest in eventually paying for a trip on a suborbital craft.

For now, the man who founded Amazon.com is spending some of the billions earned from the Seattle-based online retailer on high tech equipment and about 600 employees working in a former Boeing airplane parts facility. Bezos said he's convinced the company  a vision of his childhood dreams, will eventually be profitable.

The company isn't taking deposits yet, so it's unclear whether thousands of interested space travelers will translate into sales.

Blue Origin, founded in 2000, has launched a ship twice, and it landed safely. The company plans to keep testing until its usefulness is done then switch to other ships being built to test human flight.

The real money will be made selling rocket engines to others planning to launch satellites and spaceships, Bezos said. United Launch Alliance has asked Blue Origin to build the engine for its new launch vehicle so it can stop relying on Russian-made engines.

Bezos, who still has his day job at Amazon, said he's deeply involved at Blue Origin and spends time in the Kent facility, about 17 miles south of Seattle. He enthusiastically shared technical details and explanations during a media tour and one engineer said he was as knowledgeable about the technology as anyone in the building.

""I only pursue things that I am passionate about,"" Bezos said. He spoke of dreaming of space travel and building rockets since he was 5.

He said he wasn't ready to share exactly how much he has invested in the space venture, saying just that all the high tech equipment and about 600 employees have added up to ""a very significant number.""

The media-shy company said welcoming the press to their development floor was a first step toward more openness, but all but a few photographs of the facility were prohibited.

Bezos said he wasn't concerned about his competition to build the next generation of rocket engines because society will need lots of help moving industry and people off the planet.

A handful of other U.S. companies are currently competing in the private space business, including SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, which are also at the testing stage.

Bezos doesn't care about being the first private company to offer space tourism to the masses. The real goal is to perfect their equipment by flying as many as 100 suborbital flights a year. Bezos said safety is the No. 1 goal.

The company also wants to eventually decrease the cost of space launches by enough to put projects like building a colony on Mars within reach. The key is making spaceships reusable, which is Blue Origin's goal, Bezos said.

""What I know you cannot afford is throwing the hardware away,"" he said.

Former Eagles member placed on psychiatric hold,['Blanche Johnson'],"After Lana Rae Meisner, the wife of former Eagles bassist Randy Meisner, was accidentally shot and killed in the couples home Sunday night, the musician has been placed on a 72 hour psych hold.

Meisner was hospitalized shortly after the incident Sunday, and according to an attorney for Meisners friend James Newton, the musician is unreachable.

The only thing I know that I think is being widely reported right now is that he is indeed on a 72-hour [psychiatric] hold, and as far as I know, my client James Newton nor the family have been able to get through to him yet, Newtons lawyer Troy Martin told FOX411.

Newton, through his attorney, argued for Meisner to be put under conservatorship in April 2015 after a series of tumultuous incidents.

In January 2015, the former Eagles member was placed under court-ordered 24-hour supervision after allegedly threatening murder-suicide with an AK-47 and pills.

In court in April 2015, Newtons lawyer claimed Meisner was bipolar and suffered suicidal ideations.

In audio from a 911 call from this week's incident, the dispatcher is heard saying Meisner suffers from a mental disorder and is possibly armed with a BB gun. However, police have confirmed the BB gun was not connected to his wifes death.

Martin said Meisner reached out to Newton for help in recent years.

They were friends many years ago back in Nebraska and they had sort of lost contact up to a couple of years ago when Randy was at a traumatic brain rehab facility, he said. Jim had reached out to him by the phone and went out and visited him and at that point Randy asked Jim to help him...There was the conservatorship and that was Jim was attesting to help him was to try to get a professional in there to help take care of him.

The LAPD has revealed police had been to the Meisner residence earlier in the day Sunday, at 5:30 p.m., and they took a domestic violence incident report and left. Around 7 p.m. police responded to a call regarding a shooting, and Lana Rae Meisner was pronounced dead at the scene.

""Mrs. Meisner was moving a rifle that was stored inside a case in a closet,"" a press release explained. ""As she lifted the rifle in the case, another item within the case shifted and hit the trigger of the rifle causing it to fire and fatally injure Mrs. Meisner.""

Police confirmed Meisner was in another part of the house when the gun went off and he has not been charged for the crime.

Martin said those closest to Meisner are worried for his well-being.

We are very concerned with the reports that he has threatened to kill himself and so what our hope is that he will be receptive to his family being involved so they can give him the support he needs in this very difficult time.",[]

A sheriff's deputy saw 31-year-old Jamie Gilt of Jacksonville behaving frantically inside the truck Tuesday afternoon and quickly realized she'd been shot, according to the Putnam County Sheriff's Office.

The woman's son wasn't harmed and was reunited with family members. The Department of Children and Families will investigate.

Deputies say they have not been able to talk to Gilt because of injuries she suffered from the shot. They say she is in UF Helath hospital, and could ultimately face charges related to how she stored the gun.

Storing or leaving a loaded firearm in a way in which a child can access it is a misdemeanor. Deputies say the .45-caliber handgun was on the truck's floor.

Putman deputies found the truck, which was hauling a horse trailer, was partially parked in the road.

Gaines is in stable condition. Authorities are investigating.

Since October when the burger chain launched all-day breakfast nationwide, most McDonalds locations have been serving a limited menu. Most menus include a core list of itemssausage burrito, hotcakes, parfait, and oatmealbut menus varied by location, and most didnt serve hash browns after 10:30 a.m.

But Brand Eating reports that the chain is now serving All Day Breakfast: Bigger Menu--its entire breakfast menu, including items such as biscuits, McMuffins, McGriddles, and hash browns at select restaurants.

The move is seen as a fix for confused customers who were unsure of what they could order where. Now customers don't have to choose between breakfast sandwiches made with either biscuits or English muffins or can order McGriddles.

Even though all-day breakfast has been great for business at McDonalds, franchisees may have to scramble to offer the new items since kitchens must be configured in a certain way to accommodate serving breakfast.

All Day Breakfast: Bigger Menu is being tested in the Tulsa, Oklahoma area, as well as parts of North Carolinas Triad region. If market testing goes well it could extend nationally in the near future.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Rangers-Sabres Preview,[],"The New York Rangers' first game without Henrik Lundqvist was a pleasant surprise against the top team in hockey. The second might have had them saying enough is enough.

There's at least one more game separating their No. 1 goaltender from a return, and it's Tuesday night in Buffalo against a Sabres team seeking its first five-game point streak in nearly four years.

Lundqvist is expected to return from a neck injury this weekend - either Saturday in Detroit or Sunday at home against Pittsburgh - while Rick Nash is also nearing a return. He'll miss his 20th consecutive game with a bone bruise in his leg, but he's finally returned to practice on a no-contact basis.

""He is progressing very well,"" coach Alain Vigneault told the team's official website of Nash. ""He was week to week, now he's day to day. He's got to get a couple practices in, get some contact, with the team. I do know that it looks very positive at this point.""

They'll also be short at the blueline with Marc Staal out for a second straight game because of back spasms, and Dylan McIlrath will also skip the trip due to a knee injury.

McIlrath was injured in Sunday's 6-4 home loss to the New York Islanders as the Rangers (38-22-6) fell behind 3-0 in the opening five minutes. It followed Friday's 3-2 win in Washington. Regardless of personnel, all of their losses over a 7-4-1 span have come with the Rangers giving up at least four goals.

Nevertheless, they tied it midway through the third period before allowing a pair in the final minute and a half as the Islanders got within three points of the second-place Rangers with three games in hand.

""I'm not sure to be honest with you,"" Derek Stepan said of the Rangers' slow start. ""Maybe the three (games) in four nights, but that's no excuse. I thought we really responded well after being down 3-0.""

Antti Raanta figures to be back in goal having posted a 3.15 goals-against average over a 3-2-1 span as a starter.

The Rangers won the first meeting 6-3 at home on Jan. 25 - Nash's second game out of the lineup - and Derick Brassard picked up the slack with two goals and three assists. The center has four goals and eight assists in the last seven games in the series as part of eight straight Rangers' wins by a combined score of 32-11.

Buffalo (27-31-9) came from two goals down for Monday's 4-3 shootout win in Toronto, giving the Sabres at least a point in four straight games. They haven't made it five since a nine-game point streak in March 2012.

Evander Kane had a goal and an assist, and 11 of his 18 goals have come in the last 22 games. Jack Eichel has scored in three straight to reach 20 goals, making him the first Sabres rookie to reach that mark since Tyler Ennis in 2010-11.

""You're down two goals going into the third period. You get one back in the second, you're able to break the goalie and then they're able to get one and regain that two-goal lead,"" said Eichel, whose team had lost six straight overtime or shootout games.

""It's really big for us to be resilient in that third and play a simple game, be able to get two goals and force overtime and a shootout and see what happens. It's nice to win a shootout.""

Chad Johnson faced the Maple Leafs, so Robin Lehner could be in goal. Over a 3-3-3 span, he's posted a 1.75 GAA.",[]

The director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Tom Frieden, said that thousands of pregnant women could be infected with Zika in Puerto Rico after emphasizing that $225 million will be allocated to fight the spread of the virus in the U.S. commonwealth.

Frieden, who this week is visiting Puerto Rico to increase cooperation with local authorities in the fight against Zika, said Tuesday in San Juan that 40 experts with the CDC have been dispatched to the island to work with the administration in San Juan on measures to halt the spread of the disease.

He also emphasized that the incidence of Zika is very different in Puerto Rico from the rest of the country, given that on the continent the percentage of homes with centralized air conditioning is much higher than on the Caribbean island, a situation that allows people to avoid the mosquitoes that carry the virus.

The Puerto Rico Department of Health confirmed Tuesday that it had received the first units of blood imported from the United States, the first such shipment as methods are put in place to detect the Zika virus in locally donated blood in hospitals here.

foxnews.com,2016-03-03 00:00:00,Scientists unraveling mystery of rare whales off Madagascar,['Michael Casey'],"More than a decade ago, Salvatore Cerchio went to Madagascar to study coastal dolphins. But his attention eventually shifted to a much bigger marine mammal  a rare species of whale that calls those waters home.

Cerchio, who works for the New England Aquarium, discovered the Omuras whale in waters off the island nation in 2013 and his team had 80 sightings of the whale last year. Much of their work during that time has been trying to better understand the behavior of a whale that until 2003 was mistakenly thought to be a similar looking species, the Bryde's whale.

When we found them, we thought they were Bryde's in part because they werent supposed to be in this area. The known range of Omuras whales at that point was the western Pacific and the far eastern Indian Ocean off of Australia, Cerchio told FoxNews.com.

Related: Newborn killer whale brings hope for endangered pod

So after seeing these animals a few times in Madagascar, it occurred after we got some pretty good underwater video that these are not Bryde's whales at all but actually Omuras whales, he continued. Once we realized they were Omuras whales, it was mind boggling because first of all no one had studied these animals. No had seen them or documented them in the wild and they were not supposed to be in Madagascar. The work that weve done has extended their range significantly.

In October, Cerchio released the first video of the whale in the wild and now has fresh data on the feeding and breeding behavior of these 33- to 38-foot mammals. They came to realize the whales were feeding on levels of tiny shrimp known as euphasiids were being found in the water.

What was exciting is that we got more information on their feeding than we ever had before, he said.

They spend their entire lives in the tropics. That is really unusual and special because the tropics are a difficult to make a living, he said of the clear blue waters that often compared to a desert when it comes to food offerings for whales. How does a whale, even a small whale, make a living in a desert? That, in itself, is a fascinating question. The fact we are seeing them feed  and getting data on what they are feeding on  is a great opportunity to learn about an ecosystem and how the species fits into that ecosystem.

Along with the feeding, Cerchio and his team documented five mother/calf pairs  evidence they believe that this is a resident population living off the southeast coast of Africa.

We saw more mother and calves than we had before. In the previously year, we had no moms and calves. In 2015, we had five different moms and calves which is great, he said. That means this is a productive area. They are reproducing here, probably giving birth nearby because these were young calves.

The team also collected two weeks of continuous acoustic data from remote recordings of the whale singing  and plan to retrieve recorders in April, which will have six months more data on them. The singing  which has been seen in Humpback and Fin whales  has been less studied in tropical species.

They sing, which is by itself a very exciting discovery, Cerchio said. They sing a very simple but interesting song. Its very rhythmic and they repeat the same vocalization for hours on end. You have groups of animals singing in a chorus ... These guys are feeding, breeding and singing all in the same habitat.

The discovery of the whales in Madagascar - and mor recently Mauritania - has added urgency to what Cerchio said is a need to protect a relatively small population. Among the threats they face are getting tangled in fishing lines as well as the noise from oil and gas operations.

Whenever you have a small population like this, they tend to be more vulnerable to any local threats, he said. The small resident populations tend to have low genetic diversity and also be subject to any environmental pressures that are in that area such as oil and gas exploration.",[]
foxnews.com,2015-07-05 00:00:00,Greece poised to reject bailout offer,[],"Early poll results show Greek voters overwhelmingly rejected creditors' demands for more austerity in return for rescue loans in a critical referendum Sunday, backing Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who insisted the vote would give him a stronger hand to reach a better deal.

Tsipras gambled the future of his 5-month-old left-wing government on the vote. The opposition accused him of jeopardizing the country's membership in the 19-nation club that uses the euro and said a ""yes"" vote was about keeping the common currency.

With 70 percent of the votes counted, the ""no"" side had more than 60 percent. The interior ministry predicted that margin would hold.

Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said Sunday night that creditors planned from the start to shut down banks to humiliate Greeks and force them to make a statement of contrition for showing that debt and loans are unsustainable.

On Sunday night's result, he said that ""'no' is a big 'yes' to democratic Europe. It's a no to the vision of Europe an infinite cage for its people. It is a loud yes to the vision of the Eurozone as a common area of prosperity and social justice.""

Thousands of government supporters gathered in central Athens in celebration, waving Greek flags and chanting ""No, No, No.""

""We don't want austerity measures anymore, this has been happening for the last five years and it has driven so many into poverty, we simply can't take any more austerity,"" said Athens resident Yiannis Gkovesis, 26, holding a large Greek flag in the city's main square.

Governing left-wing Syriza party Eurodeputy Dimitris Papadimoulis said that ""Greek people are proving they want to remain in Europe"" as equal members ""and not as a debt colony."" The referendum was Greece's first in 41 years.

Minister of State Nikos Papas, speaking on Alpha television, said it would be ""wrong to link a 'no' result to an exit from the eurozone. If a 'no' prevails that will help us get a better agreement.""

Tsipras' high-stakes brinkmanship with lenders from the eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund resulted in Greece defaulting on its debts this week and shutting down its banks to avoid their collapse. He called the referendum last weekend, giving both sides just a week to campaign.

""Today, democracy is defeating fear ... I am very optimistic,"" Tsipras said earlier in the day after voting in in Athens.

European officials had openly urged Greeks to vote against the government's recommendation. The leaders of Germany and France called for a European Union summit Tuesday to discuss the situation.

""I hope people say 'yes,'"" European Parliament President Martin Schulz told German public radio. ""If after the referendum, the majority is a 'no,' they will have to introduce another currency because the euro will no longer be available for a means of payment.""

Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt was one of the first eurozone ministers to react to the initial results.

""This likely 'no' complicates matters,"" he told Belgium's VRT network, but insisted the door remained open to resume talks with the Greek government within hours.

The vote was held amid banking restrictions imposed last Monday to halt a bank run, with Greeks queuing up at ATMs across the country to withdraw a maximum 60 euros per day. Banks have been shut all week, and it is uncertain when they will reopen. Large lines once again formed at ATMs on Sunday.

Daniel Tsangaridis, a 35-year-old Athens resident, said he didn't expect banks to reopen soon, despite a government pledge that they would do so Tuesday.

""It's not going to happen in the next 48 hours,"" he said. ""If the situation improves and we can have a deal, then the banks will open.""

The Syriza party came to power in January after a six-year recession. Since then, the standoff between Athens and its international lenders has grown more bitter, and early signs of some economic growth and recovering employment in Greece have disappeared.

The debt-wracked nation also suffered repeated ratings downgrades and lost access to billions of euros after its existing bailout deal expired last week.

Polls published Friday showed the two sides in a dead heat with an overwhelming majority  about 75 percent  wanting Greece to remain in the euro currency.

""Today, we Greeks decide on the fate of our country,"" conservative opposition leader Antonis Samaras said. ""We vote 'yes' to Greece. We vote 'yes' to Europe.""

The sense of urgency was palpable as Greeks struggled to decipher a convoluted referendum question after being bombarded with frenzied messages warning of the country's swiftly approaching financial collapse.

Neither result on Sunday, however, would lead to a clear answer on what Greece should do about its overstretched finances.

Greece is no longer in a bailout program since its previous package expired last Tuesday. It now has to negotiate a new one with its creditors that involves even more money for the government and banks and new economic austerity measures.

Despite the Greek government's assertion that a ""no"" vote will not lead to a euro exit, most experts agree it would open up more uncertain financial outcomes.

A number of European politicians, including Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the top eurozone official, have said a ""no"" vote would jeopardize Greece's place in the 19-nation eurozone. Investors are also likely to believe a ""no"" win increases the chance of a so-called ""Grexit,"" where Greece returns to its own old currency.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Obama takes heat for skipping Nancy Reagan's funeral for festival,[],"President Obama once again is facing criticism for planning to skip the funeral of a prominent conservative figure, with the president expected to attend a festival over the services Friday for former first lady Nancy Reagan.

Michelle Obama plans to attend the funeral in Simi Valley, California, but the president will instead be in Austin, Texas, for the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival, a popular interactive mash-up of music, tech and film.

Obama is set to deliver a keynote speech.

Obamas decision immediately drew fire from some conservatives, with former 2012 Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann calling the move self-centered and classless.

Self-centered, classless Obama misses another funeral of a high profile conservative. https://t.co/oKKXE5iOtz  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) March 9, 2016

The controversy comes after Obama chose not to attend the funeral of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in February  a move that was heavily criticized by many on the right.

KT McFarland, former Defense official in the Reagan administration and a Fox News national security analyst, knocked Obama on Twitter for skipping the funerals of Nancy Reagan, Scalia and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

That's petty, petulant & lowclass, she wrote.

Democratic presidential candidate and former first lady Hillary Clinton, as well as former President George W. Bush, plan to attend.

Obama, though, hardly is setting a precedent by missing the funeral of a former first lady.

The Clintons did not attend the funeral of Pat Nixon in 1993. In 2007, President George W. Bush did not attend the funeral of Lady Bird Johnson, though he had no scheduled events that day.

And in 2011, Obama did not attend the funeral of former first lady Betty Ford.

President Carter also did not attend the funeral of Mamie Eisenhower in 1979, while President Reagan did not attend the funeral of Bess Truman in 1982.



But presidents have attended such services in other cases.

President John F. Kennedy attended the funeral of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's widow, Eleanor Roosevelt, in 1962. When Jacquelyn Kennedy died in 1994, President Bill Clinton and then-first lady Hillary Clinton attended.

The Obamas still paid tribute to Mrs. Reagan on Monday, saying she had ""redefined the role"" of first lady and praising her advocacy for those suffering from Alzheimers.",[]

The European Space Agencys Mars Trace Gas Orbiter and Schiaparelli landing module will launch on a Russian Roscosmos Proton rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan on March 14.

The main objectives of the mission are to search for evidence of methane and other trace atmospheric gases that could be signatures of active biological or geological processes, according to the ESA. The mission will also test key technologies that could be used for future missions to Mars.

After a seven-month journey, the Orbiter and Schiaparelli are expected to separate from the Proton on Oct. 16. The ESA spacecraft and landing module will enter Mars orbit on Oct. 19, with Schiaparelli landing on the planet for surface research.

The Orbiter will perform detailed, remote observations of the Martian atmosphere, searching for evidence of gases of possible biological importance, such as methane and its degradation products, said the ESA. The instruments onboard the Orbiter will carry out a variety of measurements to investigate the location and nature of sources that produce these gases.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Some seek alternatives to pets' post-surgery 'cone of shame',[],"Call it the cone of shame. Radar dish. Elizabethan collar.

Whatever its name, pets seem to hate the stiff, lampshade-like piece of plastic that vets often put around their necks to keep them from biting or chewing wounds, stitches or other problem areas.

""She was not a happy camper. She couldn't eat in it, she couldn't play in it, she couldn't move around in it,"" Brooke Yoder of Millersburg, Ohio, said about her Maltese-Shih Tzu dog, Marley, who got a cone to protect her stitches after she was spayed.

The first cones were handmade by pharmaceutical salesman Edward J. Schilling in the early 1960s, and they remain the best-selling wound or suture protection on the market for pets, said Ken Bowman, president of the Chino, California-based KVP International, a cone manufacturer.

Yet his company and others are trying to come up with something better.

KVP makes recovery collars in 14 styles, including two inflatables and two soft collars. They have cones to fit pets from mice to mastiffs.

The company is running studies on whether the cone acts like an amplifier, potentially hurting an animal's ears, and whether the loss of vision it causes can create stress.

One alternative has come from Stephanie Syberg of St. Peters, Missouri, founder and president of Cover Me by Tui, which makes a one-piece, post-surgical garment for dogs.

""I was in veterinary medicine myself for 16 years. I was constantly being asked, 'What can we use instead of the plastic cone?'"" Syberg said.

Her onesie, made of Peruvian cotton, was tested on 200 dogs. ""Vets are seeing the calming effect,"" she said. ""The fabric is breathable so it promotes healing.""

She sells pullover and step-in versions at TulanesCloset.com.

Dr. Charlie Sink, who runs the Grand Paws Animal Clinic in Surprise, Arizona, bought 3,000 of them on his first order.

""They are the softest cloth and the dogs just love them. You can wash them. It's an amazing product,"" said Sink, who has been a vet for 47 years.

But there are times, he said, when only the hard cone will work: if the dog's injury is on a body part not covered by the onesie, for instance.

Gayle Swetow of Henderson, Nevada, has become a regular customer of Syberg's. She was told to put a cone on her 2-year-old pit-bull mix to protect a 6-inch incision after he had surgery on his hip.

""I slept with him every night downstairs because I couldn't bear to put a cone on him,"" she said. ""That didn't work so I started frantically looking up dog onesies or dog pajamas.""

""I think I've bought 10 of them already because the dog has an allergy too. I keep him in this every day,"" Swetow said.

The cones, she continued, are ""awful. The dogs can't see where they are going. They can't jump up. Eating, moving or walking is nearly impossible with a cone. But they can do anything and everything if they have a onesie on.""

The cone's unpopularity has also led to some creative alternatives by designers and artists at the website More Than a Cone (www.morethanacone.com ).

In addition to making the cone more attractive, Bowman said, efforts are under way to make it more comfortable and effective too.",[]

Perfecting the art of jumping adds some bounce to a workout and can make even the most sedentary person more athletic in their day-to-day routine, says Scott Caulfield, the Head Strength and Conditioning Coach for the National Strength and Conditioning Association in Colorado Springs, Colo.

Jumping falls into a type of exercise we call plyometrics, Mr. Caulfield says. These exercises involve quicker, shorter motions that stimulate the stretch reflex. That reflex is responsible for explosive movement, like an outfielder reacting to a fly ball.

Donald Trump secured nearly half of all the delegates doled out in last nights four Republican contests. 71 for the frontrunner, it brings his total as projected by the AP to 458.

To clinch the nomination and avoid a contested convention in July, a candidate needs to win at least 1,237 delegates, a task that could become easier next week as some states become winner-take-all, including delegate rich Florida and Ohio.

Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders split last nights primaries in Michigan and Mississippi, though Clinton won the delegate count, and is now more than half way to the tally she needs to clinch the Democratic nomination.

FOXs Alex Hein explains:

[audio:http://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/ak.podcast.foxnewsradio.com/news/housecallforhealth/HOUSECALLFORHEALTH_03-08-2016-ad.mp3]

This is Housecall for Health.

Whether or not a doctor is rated well by patients may depend entirely on where the visit takes place.

In a small U.S. study, patients gave the same doctors different ratings depending on where their visit occurred.

Researchers compared patient satisfaction surveys collected from three different locations staffed by the same set of doctors. One was an emergency department in an urban environment, while the other two were urgent care sites in more suburban areas.

Patients who saw doctors in the emergency room gave them consistently lower scores compared to those in urgent care settings.

Although doctors may act differently in an emergency room compared to a calmer office setting, researchers say the results also suggest that ratings are not a completely reliable measure of the quality of care physicians give.

As healthcare payers put more focus on patient experience, the scores are being used to reward physicians and hospitals which do well, and punish those who dont.

Curse or not, a group of documentary filmmakers has begun poking around in unprecedented fashion. The crew from UK's Channel 4 became the first to gain permission to examine Shakespeare's grave at Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon earlier this year, reports the Telegraph, though they're using radar rather than shovels.

The results of their study, part of commemorations marking the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, will be revealed in a documentary this spring. ""We can confirm a scan of the grave has been completed,"" says a church rep.

If nothing else, the work ""is likely to give a clearer picture of a possible family vault,"" reports the Telegraph, adding that the playwright is buried next to his wife, daughter, son-in law, and grandson-in-law.

It's also possible the study could put to rest a long-standing rumor, as noted by the Stratford Observer: ""There has been historical speculation as to whether Shakespeares skull was removed by grave robbers and re-buried outside of his home town."" But a Jezebel blogger isn't banking on bombshells: ""Educated guess: Spiders, bones, and possibly an ill-advised earring."" (Could this be the famous skull?.)

""We are using information we have learned for operations, one official said. The captured operative was identified as Sleiman Daoud al-Afari.

He told U.S. interrogators ISIS had converted banned mustard gas into powdered form to launch in artillery shells, The New York Times adds.

Just yesterday, defense officials said U.S. warplanes in Syria targeted and likely killed an ISIS leader who served essentially as the terror group's secretary of defense.

The Iraq raid marks one of the first known major success of Washington's more aggressive policy of pursuing jihadis on the ground. The Obama administration launched the new strategy in December, deploying a commando force to Iraq that it said would be dedicated to capturing and killing ISIS leaders in clandestine operations, as well as generating intelligence leading to more raids.

U.S. officials said last week the Delta Force team had captured an Islamic State leader but had refused to identify him, saying only that he had been held for two or three weeks and was being questioned.

Iraqi officials said al-Afari worked for Saddam Hussein's now-dissolved Military Industrialization Authority where he specialized in chemical and biological weapons. They said al-Afari, who is about 50 years old, heads the Islamic State group's recently established branch for the research and development of chemical weapons.

He was captured in a raid near the northern Iraqi town of Tal Afar, the officials told The Associated Press. They would not give further details.

The weaponized mustard gas that ISIS has developed would not be concentrated enough to kill, but could badly wound its victims, a defense official told The Times.

An initial assessment of the U.S. airstrike conducted in Syria last week showed that it likely killed commander Omar al-Shishani, also known as Omar the Chechen, along with 12 additional ISIS fighters, officials added.

Beyond intelligence value, the capture in Iraq could strike a blow to what Iraqi and American officials have described as a determined effort by the Islamic State group to develop chemical weapons.

A Mideast watchdog released photos in 2014 suggesting the terror network seized chemical weapons from Saddam Hussein's old stockpiles and deployed them on ethnic Kurds in neighboring Syria. The Kurds apparently were killed by ""mustard gas or some kind of blistering agent, the Middle East Review of International Affairs told Fox News at the time.

ISIS was believed to have set up a special unit dedicated to chemical weapons research, made up of Iraqi scientists from the Saddam-era weapons program as well as foreign experts who joined the group. Iraqi officials expressed particular worry over the campaign because ISIS gained so much room to operate and hide chemical laboratories after overrunning around a third of the country in the summer of 2014, joined with territory they controlled in Syria.

Iraqi officials say the group has ambitions to develop more dangerous agents like nerve gas, though the U.S. has said it appears still far from that goal. Tests confirmed mustard gas was used in a town in Syria when ISIS was launching attacks there in August 2015.

The United States has been leading a coalition waging airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria for more than a year. The campaign has been key to backing Iraqi and Kurdish forces that have slowly retaken significant parts of the territory the militants had seized.

But after coming under pressure at home for greater action against the militants, the Obama administration moved to the tactic of stepped up commando operations on the ground.

Last year, U.S. special forces killed a key ISIS leader and captured his wife in a raid in Syria, but the new force in Iraq was intended as a more dedicated deployment. American officials have been deeply secretive about the operation. Its size is unknown, thought it may be fewer than 100 troops.

""This is a no-kidding force that will be doing important things,"" was about all Defense Secretary Ash Carter would say about the force in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee in December.

Yoenis Cespedes' newest custom ride is a throwback.

The New York Mets outfielder, whose car collection drew headlines early in spring training, now has a custom three-wheel cycle. It is similar to a tricycle he had in Cuba.

""He said, 'You know what? I'm going to have a bike like the one I had in Cuba,'"" Alex Vega, owner of the Auto Firm, which has customized eight other vehicles for Cespedes, said Tuesday. ""I made it to look like the Jeep we did.""

Vega said he put approximately $1,000 of work into the trike, which was a gift from Mets' cook, Theresa Corderi. According to Vega, Corderi wanted work done on her Buick Enclave, and Cespedes paid for it.

While the bike figures to get attention on social media, Vega doesn't expect it to be seen at Tradition Field, the Mets' spring training facility, anytime soon. After Cespedes brought several of his cars to training camp, and Cespedes and Noah Syndergaard rode horses at the Mets complex last week, manager Terry Collins said, ""The fun time is over. It's time to get ready for baseball.

""The manager talked to them about cutting some of that stuff out,"" Vega said. ""I don't think he's going to ride it to the stadium.""

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,77-year-old U.S. man languishes in Spanish jail after falling prey to 'romance scam',[],"A retired pastor from Maine was sentenced to six years in a Spanish prison after he allegedly fell victim to a romance scam that targets senior citizens in the United States.

Joseph Bryon Martin, 77, was arrested by Spanish authorities last year carrying $450,000 worth of cocaine  though he had no idea he was moving drugs. He was sentenced in January to six years in prison.

His son, Andy Martin, decided to bring his father's case to the attention of lawmakers in Washington, D.C.

""I'd like to get the word out about this,"" Martin told Fox News Latino, ""so other lonely seniors don't fall prey.""

He testified in February before the Senate Special Committee on Aging, thanks to the committee's chairwoman, Susan Collins of Maine, who is looking into catfishing schemes that target seniors.

At the age of 77 and in poor health, this likely is a life sentence, Martin told the committee about his father. The idea that my dad is now a convicted international drug smuggler is surreal, as he had no prior criminal history. Before this conviction, my dad had never been charged with even a misdemeanor. I dont recall him ever getting so much as a speeding ticket or parking ticket in his entire life.

According to Andy, his father had been communicating online with a woman he met on the Internet in 2009 who went by the name of Joy. She said she was a struggling artist and needed money. For several years, even though he was living on a fixed income and couldnt always pay his own rent, he would send Joy between $500 and $2,500 a month.

He got engaged to a woman in Maine  who later became his third wife  in April 2015, and he tried to break things off with Joy, sending her a message to let her know he would be no longer be sending money.

Somehow Joy convinced Martin to travel to Peru and pick up real estate documents for an estate she claimed she had inherited. She told him couldn't get a visa to make the trip herself. His new wife objected, but he still made the trip.

In Peru, he picked up two sealed packages that he told Andy felt like books, according to the Portland Press Herald. But when his flight to London was stopped in Madrid, Martin was arrested by local authorities who found the cocaine.

The U.S. government is aware of 145 Americans who have been arrested by foreign governments as a result of similar scams. Forty-four of them, including Martin, remain incarcerated overseas.

Andy told the Senate committee that his father suffers from chronic back pain and needs surgery. He had been treated for prostate cancer, had quadruple bypass surgery and has a pacemaker. He's living in the prison infirmary with eight to ten other prisoners, according to his son.

In a statement issued by her office, Collins said Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection revealed Wednesday that they have created a new initiative to combat such scams called Operation Cocoon.

So far it has prevented 16 senior citizens from boarding planes, and foreign authorities have arrested 15 suspects alleged to be involved in the romance scam.

Tuesday Collins and eight other senators sent a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry asking him to get involved in the case. In the meantime, Martin's attorneys in Spain are trying to get him released on the grounds of his advanced age and the argument that he isn't a threat to anyone.

""It's a long drawn out process, and we'd be much better off with the U.S. intervening,"" Andy Martin told Fox News Latino. ""[Seniors] get trapped, and they send money, and, once they do that, these people sell their information to other scammers. I want people to know what's happening.""

The asphalt landing strip is in Area 6 of the Yucca Flat test site, about 12 miles northeast of the infamous Area 51 that has long been the subject of conspiracy theories. In Area 6, a handful of hangars with clamshell doors are clustered at one end of the airstrip, images from Google Earth reveal.

The area, which does not have a name, is fenced off and can be seen from the road by those touring the pockmarked Nevada National Security Site of Yucca Flat, where the military conducted hundreds of nuclear tests over several decades. [14 Strangest Sights on Google Earth]

While little is known about Area 6, the Yucca Airstrip is used by both the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security, Darwin Morgan, a spokesperson for the National Nuclear Security Administration, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

""They come here to test their own sensors,"" he recently said after evading questions from the newspaper about Area 6 for months.

Drone base?

Though officials with the government have been extremely reticent to reveal any details about the site, a few details have leaked out.

A 7,500-page tome on nuclear safety at the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste project includes a brief paragraph describing Area 6 as an ""aerial operations facility.""

The purpose of this facility is to construct, operate, and test a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles. Tests include, but are not limited to, airframe modifications, sensor operation, and onboard computer development. A small, manned chase plane is used to track the unmanned aerial vehicles, according to a 2008 report in the Yucca Mountain repository license application filed by government contractor Bechtel SAIC, which built the airstrip for $9.6 million.

The airspace above the strip is controlled, which reduces the risk of planes or satellites in space getting a detailed look at the surroundings. It also prevents the public from unintentionally stumbling upon the site, Morgan told the Review-Journal.

Based on its size, the hangars could house up to 15 MQ-9 Reaper planes, the type of drones used to perform reconnaissance, Tim Brown, an imagery analyst at the defense information website GlobalSecurity.org, told the Review Journal. The runway is too small for fighter jets or bombers, he added.

One possibility is that the remotely piloted planes do practice runs for reconnaissance work. Yucca Flat's high desert terrain echoes that found in the most remote regions of Libya, where Al Qaeda or ISIS operatives could be hiding out, he said.

If that's the case, the government may be testing out sensor arrays  essentially fields of hundreds of smartphone-type cameras that are mounted on planes such as the MQ-9 Reaper to take time-lapse photography. The idea is that anything out there that's moving could, in fact, be moved by a potential terrorist or bad actor, Brown said.

Well, it hasnt stopped.

Over the weekend, social media went bonkers after Trump led a pledge at Florida ralley. Some say his gesture looked like a Nazi salute. Heres the video. Decide for yourself:

And then there was this on Saturday Night Live ....

And then were was Bill Maher ...

And comedian Louis C.K. in his newsletter ...

P.S. Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while. But the guy is Hitler. And by that I mean that we are being Germany in the 30s. Do you think they saw the shit coming? Hitler was just some hilarious and refreshing dude with a weird comb over who would say anything at all.

And Im not advocating for Hillary or Bernie. I like them both but frankly I wish the next president was a conservative only because we had Obama for eight years and we need balance. And not because I particularly enjoy the conservative agenda. I just think the government should reflect the people. And we are about 40 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal. When I was growing up and when I was a younger man, liberals and conservatives were friends with differences.

They werent enemies. And it always made sense that everyone gets a president they like for a while and then hates the president for a while. But it only works if the conservatives put up a good candidate. A good smart conservative to face the liberal candidate so they can have a good argument and the country can decide which way to go this time.

Trump is not that. Hes an insane bigot. He is dangerous. He already said he would expand libel laws to sue anyone who writes a negative hit piece about him. He says I would open up the libel laws so we can sue them and win lots of money. Not like now. These guys are totally protected. He said that. He has promised to decimate the first amendment. (If you think hes going to keep the second amendment intact youre delusional.) And he said that Paul Ryan, speaker of the house will pay for criticizing him. So Im saying this now because if he gets in there we wont be able to criticize him anymore.

Please pick someone else. Like John Kasich. I mean that guy seems okay. I dont like any of them myself but if youre that kind of voter please go for a guy like that. It feels like between him and either democrat wed have a decent choice. It feels like a healthier choice. We shouldnt have to vote for someone because theyre not a shocking cunt billionaire liar.

We should choose based on what direction the country should go. I get that all these people sound like bullshit soft criminal opportunists. The whole game feels rigged and its not going anywhere but down anymore. I feel that way sometimes.

And that voting for Trump is a way of saying fuck it. Fuck them all. I really get it. Its a version of national Suicide. Or its like a big hit off of a crack pipe. Somehow we cant help it. Or we know that if we vote for Trump our phones will be a reliable source of dopamine for the next four years. I mean I cant wait to read about Trump every day. Its a rush. But you have to know this is not healthy.

If you are a true conservative. Dont vote for Trump. He is not one of you. He is one of him. Everything you have heard him say that you liked, if you look hard enough you will see that he one day said the exact opposite. He is playing you.

In fact, if you do vote for Trump, at least look at him very carefully first. You owe that to the rest of us. Know and understand who he is. Spend one hour on google and just read it all. I dont mean listen to me or listen to liberals who put him down. Listen to your own people. Listen to John Mccain. Go look at what he just said about Trump. At a time when our world has never been more complex or more in danger... I want Republican voters to pay close attention to what our partys most respected and knowledgeable leaders and national security experts are saying about Mr. Trump, and to think long and hard about who they want to be our next Commander-in-Chief and leader of the free world.

When Trump was told what he said, Trump said Oh, he did? Well, thats not nice, he told CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Garrett. He has to be very careful. When pressed on why, Trump tacked on: Hell find out. (I cut and pasted that from CBS news)

Do you really want a guy to be president who threatens John McCain? Because John McCain cautiously and intelligently asked for people to be thoughtful before voting for him? He didnt even insult Trump. He just asked you to take a good look. And Trump told him to look out.

Remember that Trump entered this race by saying that McCain is not a war hero. A guy who was shot down, body broken and kept in a POW camp for years. Trump said I prefer the guys who dont get caught. Why did he say that? Not because he meant it or because it was important to say. He said it because hes a bully and every bully knows that when you enter a new school yard, you go to the toughest most respected guy on the yard and you punch him in the nose. If you are still standing after, youre the new boss. If Trump is president, hes not going to change. Hes not going to do anything for you. Hes going to do everything for himself and leave you in the dust.

So please listen to fellow conservatives. But more importantly, listen to Trump. Listen to all of it. Everything he says. If you liked when he said that torture works then go look at where he took it back the next day. Hes a fucking liar.

A vote for Trump is so clearly a gut-vote, and again I get it. But add a little brain to it and look the guy up. Because if you vote for him because of how you feel right now, the minute hes president, youre going to regret it. Youre going to regret it even more when he gives the job to his son. Because American democracy is broken enough that a guy like that could really fuck things up. Thats how Hitler got there. He was voted into power by a fatigued nation and when he got inside, he did all his Hitler things and no one could stop him.

Again, Im not saying vote democrat or vote for anyone else. If Hilary ends up president it should be because she faced the best person you have and you and I both chose her or him or whoever. Trump is not your best. Hes the worst of all of us. Hes a symptom to a problem that is very real. But dont vote for your own cancer. Youre better than that.

Thats just my view. At least right now. I know Im not qualified or particularly educated and Im not right instead of you. Im an idiot and Im sure a bunch of you are very annoyed by this. Fucking celebrity with an opinion. I swear this isnt really a political opinion. You dont want to know my political opinions. (And I know that Im only bringing myself trouble with this shit.) Trump has nothing to do with politics or ideology. He has to do with himself. And really

I dont mean to insult anyone. Except Trump. I mean to insult him very much. And really Im not saying hes evil or a monster. In fact I dont think Hitler was. The problem with saying that guys like that are monsters is that we dont see them coming when they turn out to be human, which they all are. Everyone is. Trump is a messed up guy with a hole in his heart that he tries to fill with money and attention. He can never ever have enough of either and hell never stop trying. Hes sick. Which makes him really really interesting. And he pulls you towards him which somehow feels good or fascinatingly bad. Hes not a monster. Hes a sad man. But all this makes him horribly dangerous if he becomes president. Give him another TV show. Let him pay to put his name on buildings.

But please stop voting for him. And please watch Horace and Pete.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Sharks-Oilers Preview,[],"Todd McLellan lost his job with the San Jose Sharks after they failed to make the playoffs for the first time in 11 seasons, a run during which it never made an appearance in the Stanley Cup Final despite having plenty of talent.

There's less pressure for postseason success in Edmonton, where McLellan is overseeing what seems like a continuous rebuild for an Oilers club that hasn't reach the playoffs since playing for the Cup in 2006.

He believes the future is bright for the Oilers, though, and they'll look to win for the fifth time in six tries against his former team that can do the same Tuesday night.

McLellan won 311 regular-season games over seven seasons with the Sharks (36-23-6) but could never get them past the Western Conference finals. The sides mutually agreed to part ways after a disappointing 89-point season in 2014-15 before the Oilers (26-35-7) hired McLellan shortly after.

San Jose has rebounded under new coach Pete DeBoer and is all but guaranteed to secure one of the Pacific Division's automatic playoff berths, but Edmonton is sitting in its familiar spot at the bottom of the West.

The Oilers acquired Patrick Maroon, Adam Pardy and Adam Cracknell at the trade deadline to add some size and have played well toward the end of another bleak season. Maroon and Lauri Korpikoski scored in Sunday's 2-1 victory at Winnipeg, giving Edmonton four wins in five games following a seven-game skid.

""We're going to have some ups and downs,"" McLellan said. ""If we can keep this attitude that we have right now and that relentlessness and tenacity in our game, we have a chance to evolve over the last month of the season and carry that into the summer.""

McLellan has faced his former team twice, winning 4-3 on Taylor Hall's overtime goal Dec. 9 and falling 3-2 on Jan. 14 after Joe Pavelski and Joonas Donskoi scored in the shootout.

Pavelski's goal 19 seconds into overtime Monday gave the Sharks a 2-1 win over Calgary as they improved to 7-1-1 on the road since Feb. 9. Brent Burns scored his 24th goal, becoming the first defenseman to reach that mark since Mike Green scored 31 in 2008-09.

San Jose sits in third place in the Pacific - five points behind Anaheim and four back of Los Angeles - as it tries for its first division title since McLellan guided it to its fourth straight in 2010-11.

""Right now you've got to keep pace with everybody,"" Pavelski said. ""Everybody's playing good. We understand our game's got to improve over the last week, week and a half. It can get better.""

Martin Jones made a career-high 47 saves against the Flames, likely meaning that James Reimer will get his second start for the Sharks since being acquired at the trade deadline. Reimer, who lost 4-2 to Vancouver on Saturday, is 4-0-0 with a 1.64 goals-against average in four starts and one relief appearance against the Oilers.

Cam Talbot was named the NHL's first star last week and has won his last four starts while stopping 141 of 144 shots. He made 36 saves in his only career start against the Sharks in the last meeting.

''When a goalie gets on a roll, sometimes the puck seems a little bigger,'' Talbot said. ''Luckily for me, it's going in the right direction right now and I'll try to keep it going as long as I can.''

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Inhaled 'poppers' can lead to vision problems,[],"A 52-year-old man in Scotland who inhaled recreational drugs called poppers developed vision problems that have lasted for months, and the impairment may even become permanent, according to a new report of his case.

The man's vision became blurred and distorted shortly after using the drugs, and he went to a hospital in Scotland in September 2015. Although the man has since recovered his vision to some extent, it remained reduced in both eyes at his last follow-up appointment about two months ago, said Dr. Joshua Luis, one of the doctors who treated the man and co-authored the report.

For this man, the lasting problems may be minimal, he noted. ""He may not be able to read as fine print as he used to, but it shouldn't have too much of an impact on day-to-day life,"" Luis told Live Science. [16 Oddest Medical Cases]

But there have been 30 published cases of vision problems and eye damage related to the use of poppers, the authors of the report said. Moreover, they suspect such cases may actually be more common than officially reported.

When the man came to the hospital, he told his doctors that his vision had been blurred and distorted for the past 10 days, and that the problems had started right after a night of clubbing, during which he inhaled poppers, which are chemicals that cause a person to feel euphoric and sexually aroused. Poppers are made of chemicals called alkyl nitrites.

When the doctors examined the man, they found that the inner and outer segments of his fovea  an area in the retina of the eye where visual acuity is normally the highest  had been disrupted. The doctors advised the man that he refrain from using the drugs again.

Three months after the man's initial visit to the hospital, his vision had improved slightly.

If a person is experiencing problems with his or her vision after taking poppers, the best way to prevent these problems from getting worse is to stop using the drugs, the authors of the report said.

However, this does not guarantee that the person's vision will go back to normal: though some patients do recover their vision completely, the vision of other patients does not get better with time, according to the report, published today (March 7) in the journal BMJ Case Reports.

There are no treatments for the vision problems and eye damage that the man in the report experienced after taking the drugs, although some previous reports have suggested that a patient might benefit from taking a carotenoid called lutein, the researchers said.

A vision problem is not the only health effect linked to the use of poppers. For example, the authors of a report published in 2002 in the Journal of Emergency Medicine described two cases of people who experienced temporary blood problems after inhaling the drugs.

Specifically, the people had an abnormal amount of methemoglobin  a type of hemoglobin  in their blood, which resulted in a decreased availability of oxygen to some tissues in their bodies and blue-grey discoloration of the skin. Both people recovered after receiving treatment.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that using poppers may increase people's risk of HIV because they reduce users' inhibitions to engage in risky sexual behavior.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Mysterious 'Area 6' landing strip in Nevada desert baffles experts,[],"A mysterious, mile-long landing strip in the remote Nevada desert could be the home base for testing sensors on a top-secret fleet of drones, security experts speculate.

The asphalt landing strip is in Area 6 of the Yucca Flat test site, about 12 miles northeast of the infamous Area 51 that has long been the subject of conspiracy theories. In Area 6, a handful of hangars with clamshell doors are clustered at one end of the airstrip, images from Google Earth reveal.

The area, which does not have a name, is fenced off and can be seen from the road by those touring the pockmarked Nevada National Security Site of Yucca Flat, where the military conducted hundreds of nuclear tests over several decades. [14 Strangest Sights on Google Earth]

While little is known about Area 6, the Yucca Airstrip is used by both the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security, Darwin Morgan, a spokesperson for the National Nuclear Security Administration, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

""They come here to test their own sensors,"" he recently said after evading questions from the newspaper about Area 6 for months.

Drone base?

Though officials with the government have been extremely reticent to reveal any details about the site, a few details have leaked out.

A 7,500-page tome on nuclear safety at the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste project includes a brief paragraph describing Area 6 as an ""aerial operations facility.""

The purpose of this facility is to construct, operate, and test a variety of unmanned aerial vehicles. Tests include, but are not limited to, airframe modifications, sensor operation, and onboard computer development. A small, manned chase plane is used to track the unmanned aerial vehicles, according to a 2008 report in the Yucca Mountain repository license application filed by government contractor Bechtel SAIC, which built the airstrip for $9.6 million.

The airspace above the strip is controlled, which reduces the risk of planes or satellites in space getting a detailed look at the surroundings. It also prevents the public from unintentionally stumbling upon the site, Morgan told the Review-Journal.

Based on its size, the hangars could house up to 15 MQ-9 Reaper planes, the type of drones used to perform reconnaissance, Tim Brown, an imagery analyst at the defense information website GlobalSecurity.org, told the Review Journal. The runway is too small for fighter jets or bombers, he added.

One possibility is that the remotely piloted planes do practice runs for reconnaissance work. Yucca Flat's high desert terrain echoes that found in the most remote regions of Libya, where Al Qaeda or ISIS operatives could be hiding out, he said.

If that's the case, the government may be testing out sensor arrays  essentially fields of hundreds of smartphone-type cameras that are mounted on planes such as the MQ-9 Reaper to take time-lapse photography. The idea is that anything out there that's moving could, in fact, be moved by a potential terrorist or bad actor, Brown said.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Dropout drama: Are the media pushing Marco Rubio to get out?,['Howard Kurtz'],"The Republican primary contest has become the great dropout derby.

The media are obsessed with whos getting out, and when, and some are giving the reluctant candidates a nudge.

Nowhere was this more evident than in the confrontation between the Marco Rubio campaign and CNN.

The network reported, according to sources, that a battle was raging within the Rubio campaign over whether the senator should drop out before next Tuesdays Florida primary, which Donald Trump is leading in the polls.

In the report, Jamie Gangel quoted a source familiar with the discussions as saying that Rubio doesnt want to get killed in his home state, and that a poor showing would be a risk and hurt his political future.

Alex Conant, Rubios communications director, told me yesterday that he was blindsided by the story. I called everyone I knew over there and said, what is this? They didnt even reach out for comment before going on air, and its utterly false.

Conant told me he called several people at CNN, hopped in a taxi and went to the Washington bureau, where he went on the air with Wolf Blitzer and called the report fiction.

Conant says he was later bumped from a previously scheduled appearance with Anderson Cooper that eveningbumped so late that he was in a car outside the Capitol Hill bureau, waiting to see if he could get on.

Gangel, while noting Conants denial, told viewers that we double-checked with our source who confirmed that our story was 100 percent correct.

CNN says in a statement that there were multiple sources for the story, not one. But the network had a responsibility to ask the Rubio folks for comment before airing such a potentially damaging story.

The thing about unnamed advisers is that they could be part of a campaigns innermost circle or outside kibitzers who check in once in awhile. But CNN is confident that its sources are sufficiently high-level and genuinely concerned about Rubio's future. What's more, it hasn't escaped anyone's notice that the Rubio campaign is fundraising off the incident.

And the impact of such stories is amplified by the hundreds of outlets that pick it up, in this case on the day before the voting in Michigan and three other states. For people to wake up and see the banner of Drudge with a false report is not helpful, Conant told me.

Meanwhile, some Cruz supporters in Hawaii got e-mails or saw social media posts about Rubio and the CNN report, reminiscent of the Cruz camp jumping the gun in Iowa about Ben Carson possibly quitting, prompting an apology from the senator. In this case, a campaign statement said that these actions were not sanctioned by the Cruz for President campaign but were done by some volunteers. The campaign said these people have been contacted and told to remove the material.

Theres a larger issue here, and it has to do with the media drumbeat for whether a candidatewhich can become so loud that it drowns out the persons message and hastens the process.

The Jeb Bush death watch became such a prominent feature of his coverage that it seemed almost anti-climactic when he quit on the night of the South Carolina primary.

Rubios situation isnt as dire, but naturally his poor performance in the last several contests has given rise to such talkespecially with Ted Cruz suggesting his Senate colleague consider dropping out and Donald Trump urging Rubio to do so.

And this takes on heightened importance because of the GOPs stop-Trump movement. If Rubio wins Florida, where hes trailing Trump by 8 points in the latest poll, he can probably stay in the race. The same goes for John Kasich with Ohio. And that would probably deny Trump the 1,237 delegates he needs to win this thing before Cleveland.

But if Rubio cant win his home state, his campaign is almost definitely over, and his political career might be jeopardized as well.

So what he does in the next week is a legitimate story. But in fairness to Rubio, the media need to give him a chance to make his case, and not just hound him over why hes still in the race.

So heres a novel suggestion: Why dont we let the voters decide?

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Early data suggests pedestrian deaths surged in 2015,[],"Pedestrian deaths surged by an estimated 10 percent last year as the economy improved, the price of gas plunged and motorists put more miles behind the wheel than ever before, according to an analysis of preliminary state traffic fatality data.

The growing use of cellphones distracting drivers and walkers may also be partially to blame, states a report released by the Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents governors' highway safety offices. Warmer weather and shorter winters along with a greater awareness of health benefits may also be encouraging people to walk more.

""This is really sobering news,"" said Richard Retting, co-author of the report. ""Pedestrian safety is clearly a growing problem across the country.""

The data analyzed were from the first half of 2015. If the trend holds true for the full year, it would be the largest year-to-year increase in pedestrian deaths since 1975 when the current federal system for recording traffic deaths was created.

The report is based on state traffic fatality figures, extrapolated for the full year by researchers at Sam Schwartz Consulting, which specializes in transportation matters.

There were 2,368 pedestrians killed in the first six months of 2015, compared to 2,232 during the same period in 2014  a six percent increase. Researchers arrived at a 10 percent increase for the entire year by factoring in that fatalities for the first half of the year are typically underreported, and that for at least the last five years an average of 25 percent more pedestrian deaths were recorded in the second half of the year, which includes warmer summer months, Retting said.

Total traffic deaths, which had been trending downward for the past decade, were also up an estimated 8 percent last year. But pedestrian fatalities have been rising since 2005, and now account for 15 percent of total traffic deaths. The last time pedestrian deaths accounted for that large a share of traffic deaths was 25 years ago.

Nearly three-quarters of pedestrian deaths occur after dark, and a third of those killed had been drinking alcohol, according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration data. By comparison, about 15 percent of motorists involved in those crashes had a blood alcohol content at the legal limit or higher.

Four large population states  California, Florida, Texas and New York  accounted for 42 percent of the pedestrian deaths in the first six months of 2015. States with the highest rate of pedestrian fatalities per 100,000 residents were scattered across the country  Florida, 1.35; Arizona, 1.27; Delaware, 1.27; South Carolina, 1.12; Mississippi, 1.07; Oregon, 1.04, and New Mexico, 1.01. The District of Columbia also tied Oregon for the sixth highest rate, 1.04.

In a related issue, the Amalgamated Transit Union, which represents city bus drivers, estimates that roughly one pedestrian is killed every 10 days by a city bus because of blind spots in poorly designed buses. Wide ""A pillars,"" which connect the windshield to the driver's side window, and poorly placed side mirrors frequently obstruct drivers' view of intersections, according to the union.

""Until the industry demands a change in the design of buses to remove the unnecessary blind spots like European buses, people will continue to die in these preventable accidents,"" said Larry Hanley, the union's president.",[]

In a Facebook post thats gained over 330,000 likes, mom Dorrie Nuttal shared the story and a photo of the dog, black Labrador Jedi guarding over her son, Luke, who has type 1 diabetes.

This is a picture of Jedi saving his boy. Saving him from highs and lows and from ever feeling alone, Dorrie wrote in the March 3 post.

This may just look like a dog, a sleeping boy and a number on a screen, but this, this moment right here is so much... Posted by Saving Luke - Luke and Jedi - Fighting Type 1 Diabetes Together on Thursday, March 3, 2016

Five minutes before the photo was taken, Dorrie wrote, the family was asleep. Then Jedi jumped on and off the bed where Luke, 7, was sleeping and lay on Dorrie until she woke up. Jedi then bowedhis alert that Jedis glucose was too low.

Dorrie checked her sons glucose monitor, and it read at 100, which was normal. Jedi still refused to get off of the bed. Suddenly, Dorrie realized the seriousness of the situation and pricked her sons finger the reading was 57, too low for the boy, who was recovering from a stomach bug.

Luke was laying right next to me, just inches from me, and without Jedi I would have had no idea that he was dropping out of a safe range. He has never woken up on his own for a low in over 4 and a half years, she wrote.

As a diabetic alert dog, Jedi has been trained for the last three years to detect a high or low level or blood sugar and notify humans. Owing to their sharp sense of smell, certain dog breeds that are fit for detecting bombs are also good at sniffing out hard-to-detect scents emitted by people who lack insulin, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Type 1 diabetes affects fewer than 5 percent of people with the disease, according to the American Diabetes Association. Individuals are unable to produce insulin, a hormone the body uses to get glucose from the bloodstream into the bodys cells.

Dorrie took the photo in a moment after giving Luke a glucose tab to raise his blood sugar.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,How to make the world's best meatballs,[],"Confession: I'd never made meatballs for dinner until a couple weeks ago. Maybe it's because I'm gluten-free, or because I just never thought of them, or because I was traumatized by some sorry, stiff meatballs I ate in my pastI don't really know.

Whatever the reason, I'm now a convert. Because once I realized how much fun it is to flavor and shape meatballs however I want, I fell hard for them. Today my freezer is stocked with a few different kinds of uncooked meatballs that I can pull out as needed to make dinner for myselfor a group of six.

You don't need a recipe to make meatballs. In fact, they're more fun without. All you need is to memorize this golden ratio:

1.&nbsp1 pound of ground meat + 1 handful breadcrumbs + 1 handful chopped alliums + 1 egg iStock 1 pound ground meat This is the easy part. Meatballs can be made with ground beef, pork, veal, lamb, chicken, or turkey. You can mix two or three together for your own personal blend, or stick with just one meat. A bit of finely chopped bacon or pancetta can also be added to any of these for richer, smokier meatballs. And any raw sausage (removed from its casing) counts as ground meat, too. A pound of meat is enough to make meatballs for 4. But while my meatball ratio scales up to serve more people, I don't recommend scaling down. Instead, make the full 1 pound batch of meatballs and freeze whatever you don't want to eat. (Freeze the meatballs raw.) 1 handful breadcrumbs For every pound of meat, you want to add about one handful (or about 1/4 cup) of breadcrumbs, which also help hold everything together. I like to use fresh breadcrumbs made by blitzing a piece of stale bread in the food processorthey're softer and mushier and more absorbent that way. (You can use any kind of bread for this, including gluten-free bread.) If you don't want to make your own breadcrumbs, go for panko rather than traditional dried breadcrumbs; panko has better texture. 1 handful chopped alliums For both flavor and textural variety, you want to add the same amount of finely chopped alliums (onions, shallot, and/or garlic) as breadcrumbs: one handful (or 1/4 cup) per pound of meat you use. If you can't stand alliums (or maybe you're allergic?) you can totally skip them, or add less. But don't add moretoo much will compromise the structure of your meatballs.

2.&nbspPut it all in a bowl and season. iStock No need to mix the ground meat, breadcrumbs, and alliums together yet. Just get all of it into the same bowl and start seasoning. Begin with a good sprinkle of salt. From there, it's up to you. I like a lot of fresh herbs (try lamb meatballs loaded with chopped mint, dill, parsley, cumin and red pepper flakes). For classic Italian flavoring, add a generous dose of grated parm, some oregano (dried or fresh) and some parsley and freshly ground black pepper. Add a dollop of tomato paste if that's your thing. Or consider curry, paprika, miso, ginger or chipotle. Play, but don't go crazy: it's better to add too little than too much. How do you know how it'll taste? We'll get to that in a second, but first...

3.&nbspDon't forget the egg. iStock For every pound of meat you use, you need one egg to help hold it all together. Whisk the egg in a bowl, then pour it over your the meat, breadcrumbs, alliums, and seasonings. (Using two pounds of meat? Use two eggs. A pound and a half of meat? Whisk one egg, discard half of it, then add a second egg.) Now use your handsyes, your handsto mash and squish and combine everything together until well combined.",[]

Skulls of the fish known as Rhinconichthys were found in Colorado and the re-examination of a second one from Japan  which triples the numbers of species in the genus known to science and greatly expands their geographical range. Until now, the only fossils of this fish had been found in England.

The fish dates to 92 million years during the Cretaceous Period.

Based on our new study, we now have three different species of Rhinconichthys from three separate regions of the globe, each represented by a single skull, Kenshu Shimada, a paleobiologist at DePaul University, said of the species that have been named R. purgatoirensis and R. uyenoi. This tells just how little we still know about the biodiversity of organisms through the Earth's history. It's really mindboggling.

Rhinconichthys belongs to an extinct bony fish group called pachycormids, which contains the largest bony fish ever to have lived. Estimated to have been than 6.5 feet, its strangest feature might be the pair of bones called hyomandibulae that formed a massive oar-shaped lever to protrude and swing the jaws open extra wide, like a parachute.

Planning a trip is exciting, but it can also be exhausting. Whether its finding the best hotel deal, keeping track of booking information or getting directions to wherever youre going, there are a few easy-to-use resources that can cut down the stress.

Here are my five favorite travel resources, designed to make any vacation thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.

1.&nbspHassle-Free Planning TripIt One of the most stressful parts of planning a trip is ensuring you have all your information  hotel address, car rental information, restaurant reservations, etc.  in one place. TripIt is one of the best tools available. Just input (or email) your booking information, and you get a detailed itinerary  generated entirely by TripIt  that is accurate and easy to access. Your itinerary can be as detailed as you want, and its easy to share with family and friends.

2.&nbspSimplified Currency Exchange The Converted When traveling abroad, trading your cash for foreign bills is a good way to get hustled. Currency rates at money exchange booths are notoriously bad, and theyre entirely avoidable in this digital age. Try The Converted, an app for iOS and Android smartphones. Its crisp and clear layout allows users to easily convert their own currency into the currency of the country theyre visiting. The exchange rates are updated daily, so it serves as a great baseline to make sure youre not getting swindled. The app is also great for converting units  a function that should prove especially handy for American travelers who arent familiar with the metric system.

3.&nbspNavigation Know-How Waze Whether traveling near or far, its always a good idea to have a navigational aid, and one of my favorites is Waze. This free, easy-to-use app is a huge boon whenever Im on a road Ive never driven before. Not only does Waze give navigational directions (including spoken turn-by-turn instructions), but it also processes information from other Waze users to calculate the worst traffic spots and provide the fastest, most efficient routes for getting around. It can add hours of vacation time that you might otherwise spend in traffic. Plus, you dont need to worry about where to fill up; Waze will direct you to nearby gas stations.

4.&nbspHotel Room Bookings from Your Fingertips Hotwire Booking hotels at the 11th hour can lead to some very steep discounts. While travelers will find it simple enough to book through first-party hotel apps like Hilton or Hyatt, apps from online travel agencies can save some major cash. Hotwires mobile app is one such tool; it gives users access to rooms in over 125,000 hotels in more than 3,415 cities and 61 countries, and it provides savings  even on same-day bookings  of up to 60 percent.

5.&nbspGet Social to Find the Best Travel Savings Facebook Some of the best vacation tools are the social networks you already use on a daily basis. Travel companies use Facebook, Twitter and other social networks to promote new deals and promotions. By using searches and hashtags, travelers can find the latest deals, including 24-hour promotional discounts and vacation giveaways.

6.&nbspBonus Tip: Get Cracking on Packing Packing Pro For those who often forget to pack all their items or check off all their to-dos, theres a wonderful app called Packing Pro that helps you create a packing list for your getaway based on the number of people in your group and the length of your trip. Its a must-have for the forgetful traveler.

The detective, who is not being identified because he works undercover, was wearing a ""body armor"" style vest when he got out of his car to approach the suspect, Hackney said. The word ""police"" was marked clearly on the vest.

The driver immediately opened fire, Hackney said, hitting the detective in the head, upper body and hand. The detective was out of surgery Wednesday afternoon and in critical but ""more stable condition.""

The suspect, who has not yet been identified, ran away from the shooting scene and stole a large flatbed truck from a nearby business, Hackney said.

The detective, whose 14-year-old son was in the car but unharmed, managed to call for help.

The officers located the truck and pursued it into a nearby neighborhood, where it crashed into a house. The man ran into the backyard and two officers found the suspect holding a gun. They ordered him to drop it, Hackney said, and when he didn't, the suspect was shot four times. He survived and is in custody.

The officers who fired are on administrative leave.

It was unclear why the detective had his vest on while off duty. Hackney said narcotics detectives often carry their bullet-proof vests in the car with them because they can be called into work at any time.

foxnews.com,2015-09-18 00:00:00,Fed comments add to jitters about China economy but economists warn of overblown fears,[],"The Federal Reserve chief's rare comments on China reinforced unease its weakening economy might be headed for a deeper slump. But many experts still think fears of a China crisis are overblown.

The world's second-largest economy has been stubbornly resistant to stimulus following five interest rate cuts since November. Growth in many industries is still decelerating. August exports and auto sales shrank.

On Thursday, U.S. Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen mentioned China along with inflation after Fed governors put off a long-expected interest rate hike. Such concern is unusual for the Fed, which usually limits its focus to the U.S. economy.

""The question is whether or not there might be a risk of a more abrupt slowdown than most analysts expect,"" Yellen told reporters.

Much of China's slowdown is self-imposed as part of the ruling Communist Party's effort to replace a worn-out model based on trade and investment with more self-sustaining growth driven by domestic consumption.

Instead of leveling off in what President Xi Jinping has dubbed the ""new normal,"" economic growth has ground steadily lower as steel mills, coal mines and other heavy industry shed jobs, raising the risk of a politically dangerous spike in unemployment.

""We are not expecting a hard landing, but clearly there is no sign that things are improving any time soon,"" said economist Wei Li at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

Many economists say fears of a Chinese collapse are not grounded in reality.

The main stock market index, despite a collapse in prices in June, is up 40 percent from its level last year. Auto sales contracted by 3.4 percent in August but Chinese drivers still bought 1.4 million cars, minivans and SUVs.

""GDP is still growing at a 7 percent rate, and that is not too shabby,"" said Carl B. Weinberg of High Frequency Economics in a report. ""People are not being thrown out of work en masse, as they are in southern Europe, by bone-crushing economic contraction.""

Abroad, weaker Chinese demand for iron ore from Australia and Brazil, copper from Chile and other industrial materials already has depressed global prices. Lower oil prices have pushed Canada into recession.

China also is the biggest trading partner for most of its Asian neighbors and weaker demand for industrial components has hurt suppliers in Japan, South Korea and Southeast Asia.

The impact on the United States, which relies less on trade, is expected to be more modest. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, reckons that every 1 percentage point drop in China's economic growth strips 0.2 percentage point off U.S. growth.

Chinese leaders, who say their growth target this year is ""about 7 percent,"" have tried to lower expectations without sparking panic.

Speaking last week, Premier Li Keqiang said the transition will be ""painful and treacherous."" He tried to downplay the focus on the headline growth rate, saying Beijing will accept a slower expansion so long as it generates enough jobs and incomes rise.

""If there are signs the economy is sliding out of the proper range, we have the ability to deal with the situation,"" said Li at the World Economic Forum in the eastern city of Dalian.

Chinese leaders' reputation as economic managers took a hit from their panicked, multibillion-dollar intervention to stop a slide in stock prices. That was widely seen as clumsy and ineffective.

On Thursday, Yellen referred to ""concerns about the deftness"" of Chinese policy.

Beijing still has room to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates or stepping up government spending, according to analysts. But that would be a retreat from the ruling party's campaign to reduce reliance on state-led investment.

The premier and other officials have insisted that longer-term growth has to come not from stimulus but from opening more of the state-dominated economy to entrepreneurs.

A long-awaited reform plan issued Sunday promises to overhaul state companies that control industries from oil to banking to telecoms and are seen as a costly drag on the economy. But analysts expressed disappointment that it fails to address key issues such as monopolies and does too little to reduce the party's role in management.

""China's latest proposals to shake up state-owned industry are underwhelming,"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard and Mark Williams of Capital Economics in a report.

More ambitious changes were blocked by companies with allies in the ruling party and regulators who don't want to see their status reduced, according to businesspeople and economists.

That might prompt some people to welcome an economic crisis in hopes it would force party factions to cooperate, said Li at Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

""A crisis is not necessarily a bad thing for China,"" said Li. ""It becomes a trigger of reform.""

foxnews.com,2016-02-01 00:00:00,UK fertility regulator approves controversial gene editing technique,[],"Britain's fertility regulator has approved a scientist's application to edit the genetic code in human embroys.



In a statement Monday, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority said it has approved research led by scientist Kathy Niakan to try to understand the genes that embryos need to develop successfully.

Niakan, of the Francis Crick Institute, plans to use gene editing to analyze the first week of an embryo's growth.



Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute, said Niakan's research would ""enhance our understanding of (in vitro fertilization) success rates, by looking at the very earliest stage of human development.""

The scientists will not be allowed to implant any embryos used in their research into women. The embryos, which would be donated by couples undergoing IVF treatment who do not need them, must also be destroyed after two weeks.

Last year, Chinese researchers made the first attempt at modifying genes in human embryos. Their laboratory experiment didn't work but raised the prospect of altering genes to repair the genes of future generations.

Scientists say such techniques could lead to treatments for inherited diseases like muscular dystrophy and HIV. Critics warn that tweaking the genetic code this way could eventually lead to genetically modified human babies.

Around the world, laws and guidelines vary widely about what kind of research on embryos that will change the genes of future generations, is allowed. In the U.S., the National Institutes of Health won't fund this kind of research but private funding is allowed.



Critics warn that tweaking the genetic code this way could eventually lead to a slippery slope.



""This is the first step on a path that scientists have carefully mapped out towards the legalization of (genetically modified) babies,"" said David King, of anti-gene manipulation group Human Genetics Alert, last month when the British fertility regulator held its meeting to decide on granting the gene editing license.

Continue Reading Below

The infighting has been percolating for days, people with direct knowledge of the matter say; The battle however began picking up steam after Tuesday nights poor showing by the candidate, who failed to win a single state or a single delegate in the Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii contests.

With that, some major donors Wednesday began to urge Rubio to drop out of the race before next Tuesdays all-important primaries in Florida and Ohio. Recent internal polls show the U.S. senator from Florida losing his home state by a wide margin to businessman and GOP front runner Donald Trump.

Likewise, recent polls show that Rubio is failing to attract enough votes to place even among the top three candidates in Ohio, where its governor, John Kasich, is looking to upset Trump.

Rubio campaign officials deny that the Florida senator is contemplating an early exit from the campaign and say he will continue on through the GOP convention in July.

But major donors who have advised Rubio say based on their conversations, Rubios ultimate intentions are less certain, and while he may not drop out before Florida, they believe based on these conversations, he will drop out of the race if he loses there.

They say the candidate has listened to their logic that by remaining in the campaign and losing in his home state to Trump, Rubio would go a long way to handing the nomination to Trump, the volatile Manhattan real estate mogul and reality TV star.

With that, they are urging him to drop out as soon as possible and endorse Texas Senator Ted Cruz or Kasich, who have a better chance of beating Trump and winning the general election. With Trump as the nominee, they told Rubio, he has all but assured that the likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton would win the general election in the fall given Trumps high negatives among Independent, women and minority voters.

If Trump wins and the GOP gets trounced, possibly even losing the senate, Marco will then take the fall, said one GOP operative.

Rubios paid staffers are urging the candidate to stay in the race at least through Florida because by dropping out early, he would look like a loser and that would hurt his long-term presidential prospects more than anything else. And so far, he appears to be siding with the staffers.

Rubio is scheduled to attend Thursdays CNN debate in Miami, which gives him yet another opportunity to display his policy chops against Trump, who has been erratic in such matchups.

Another issue involves millions of dollars in anti-Trump attack ads financed by GOP political action committees that are scheduled to hit before the primary; These ads could move the polls in Rubios direction and give him some hope of winning Florida.

But major Rubio donors are dubious, and they are advising the candidate the sooner he leaves, the better for himself and the party. Nothing has worked against Trump so far, one told FOX Business. And Marco has only a small window to stop him from being the nominee.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Some seek alternatives to pets' post-surgery 'cone of shame',[],"Call it the cone of shame. Radar dish. Elizabethan collar.

Whatever its name, pets seem to hate the stiff, lampshade-like piece of plastic that vets often put around their necks to keep them from biting or chewing wounds, stitches or other problem areas.

""She was not a happy camper. She couldn't eat in it, she couldn't play in it, she couldn't move around in it,"" Brooke Yoder of Millersburg, Ohio, said about her Maltese-Shih Tzu dog, Marley, who got a cone to protect her stitches after she was spayed.

The first cones were handmade by pharmaceutical salesman Edward J. Schilling in the early 1960s, and they remain the best-selling wound or suture protection on the market for pets, said Ken Bowman, president of the Chino, California-based KVP International, a cone manufacturer.

Yet his company and others are trying to come up with something better.

KVP makes recovery collars in 14 styles, including two inflatables and two soft collars. They have cones to fit pets from mice to mastiffs.

The company is running studies on whether the cone acts like an amplifier, potentially hurting an animal's ears, and whether the loss of vision it causes can create stress.

One alternative has come from Stephanie Syberg of St. Peters, Missouri, founder and president of Cover Me by Tui, which makes a one-piece, post-surgical garment for dogs.

""I was in veterinary medicine myself for 16 years. I was constantly being asked, 'What can we use instead of the plastic cone?'"" Syberg said.

Her onesie, made of Peruvian cotton, was tested on 200 dogs. ""Vets are seeing the calming effect,"" she said. ""The fabric is breathable so it promotes healing.""

She sells pullover and step-in versions at TulanesCloset.com.

Dr. Charlie Sink, who runs the Grand Paws Animal Clinic in Surprise, Arizona, bought 3,000 of them on his first order.

""They are the softest cloth and the dogs just love them. You can wash them. It's an amazing product,"" said Sink, who has been a vet for 47 years.

But there are times, he said, when only the hard cone will work: if the dog's injury is on a body part not covered by the onesie, for instance.

Gayle Swetow of Henderson, Nevada, has become a regular customer of Syberg's. She was told to put a cone on her 2-year-old pit-bull mix to protect a 6-inch incision after he had surgery on his hip.

""I slept with him every night downstairs because I couldn't bear to put a cone on him,"" she said. ""That didn't work so I started frantically looking up dog onesies or dog pajamas.""

""I think I've bought 10 of them already because the dog has an allergy too. I keep him in this every day,"" Swetow said.

The cones, she continued, are ""awful. The dogs can't see where they are going. They can't jump up. Eating, moving or walking is nearly impossible with a cone. But they can do anything and everything if they have a onesie on.""

The cone's unpopularity has also led to some creative alternatives by designers and artists at the website More Than a Cone (www.morethanacone.com ).

In addition to making the cone more attractive, Bowman said, efforts are under way to make it more comfortable and effective too.",[]

The discovery is the latest twist for a site that has quite a history. It was home for the Schneller Orphanage from 1860 until World War II. During the British Mandate, its German inhabitants were expelled and a military base was established there. Following the British withdrawal in 1948, the compound was turned over to the Hagana, a Jewish paramilitary organization, and later served as an army base for the Israel Defense Force until 2008.

Ahead of the new construction, the Israel Antiquities Authority was tasked with doing an archaeological excavation. During the process, they found the winery that is about 1,600 years old that included a pressing surface paved with a white mosaic. There is also a pit for pressing the grapes and eight cells around the pressing surface that probably were used for storing the grapes, and possibly for making different flavors of wine.

The archaeological finds discovered here help paint a living, vibrant and dynamic picture of Jerusalem as it was in ancient times up until the modern era.""

Amit Reem, the Jerusalem district archaeologist, said the discovery demonstrates what can be achieved when scientists work with the ultra-Orthodox Haredi community.

The general public is used to hearing of the clashes between the archaeologists and the orthodox community around the issue of the graves, but is unaware of the joint work done on a daily basis and the interest expressed by the ultra-orthodox sector, he said in a statement. The Israel Antiquities Authority is working to instill our ancient cultural heritage in this population, as it does with other sectors.

The archaeologists believe that this winery served the residents of a large manor house, whose inhabitants made their living by, among other things, viticulture and wine production.

Next to the winery, archeologists also found evidence of a bathhouse  including terra cotta pipes used to heat the bathhouse and several clay bricks, some of which were stamped with the name of the Tenth Roman Legion. This legion was one of four Roman legions that participated in the conquest of Jewish Jerusalem, and its units remained garrisoned in the city until c. 300 A.D.

Russias arms buildup in Armenia poses a threat to Turkey, NATO, and global economic stability warns former U.S. Ambassador to Bahrain Adam Ereli.

His recent article in Forbes magazine details Russias more than one billion dollar militarization on Turkeys eastern border and warns Washington continues to ignore the Armenian buildup despite threats it poses to NATO member Turkey.

Putin is creating a new satellite state on NATOs border and threatening an indispensable U.S. ally, said Ereli, a career diplomat who served in Egypt, Syria and Bahrain. He cites military data that shows Russia is building up its two bases in Armenia, the deployment of 5000 soldiers and other military personnel as well as arms including modern helicopter gunships and ballistic missiles sent to Armenia. Ereli warns the fractured allegiances in the region, Russias support of Syrian dictator Bashar Hafez al-Assad and Turkeys alliance with the United States against ISIS could be potential fault lines that could snap with dangerous ramifications. Last year a Turkish air force jet shot down a Russian bomber flying missions over Syria after the bomber crossed into Turkeys air space. The incident raised the specter that the Syrian civil war could spread. Ereli writes, The Russian military presence in Armenia represents a dagger pointed at the heart of NATO as the Armenia-Russian alliance strengthens.

In the latest episode of TALKENOMICS Ambassador Ereli dives deeper into the threats the United States faces from Russia including its alliance with Iran and why lack of a consistent U.S. foreign policy in the region raises dangerous alarms, sooner or later a crisis will strike this part of the world.

It denies local bishops are out of touch with the people, and says the pope's comments ""might be due to someone near him who gave him bad advice.""

The editorial ends with the question: ""Who gave the pope bad advice?""

The rector of the Pontifical University of Mexico, Mario Angel Flores, said the editorial appeared ill-advised, given that the pope's comments ""were very frank words, inviting everyone to be more clear.""

""They are trying to downplay and question his words, which is not the most correct thing to do,"" Flores said.

Apart from his speech to the bishops, even Francis' prayers to the Virgin of Guadalupe reflected his concern that the Mexican church needs to get its priorities straight.

During his half-hour of silent prayer, Francis later told reporters, ""I prayed for the Mexican people, and one thing I prayed for a lot was that priests be true priests, and sisters be true sisters and bishops be true bishops as the Lord wants.""

foxnews.com,2016-01-25 00:00:00,Mini T. Rex: 'Welsh Dragon' may be earliest Jurassic dinosaur,[],"Two brothers hunting for ichthyosaur fossils along the coast of the United Kingdom came across something far more astounding: The bones of what may be the earliest known dinosaur from the Jurassic period in the U.K., and possibly even the world, a new study finds.

After finding the bones in 2014, Rob Hanigan contacted his brother, Nick. The two scoured the coast, located just south of Wales, for more of the fossils, taking careful geological notes along the way.

Later, they reached out to paleontologists at the University of Portsmouth, who confirmed that the bones belonged to a theropod, a group of mostly meat-eating dinosaurs. Moreover, the paleo-beast lived at a key point of dinosaur diversification at the beginning of the Jurassic, said study co-author Steven Vidovic, a doctoral researcher of paleontology at the University of Portsmouth.

""It's a jumbled mix of bones that are a real puzzle to put back together,"" Vidovic told Live Science in an email. ""It was very rewarding reconstructing it.""

The researchers named the newfound species Dracoraptor hanigani, which roughly translates to ""dragon raptor."" (The dragon is the national symbol of Wales.) It also honors Nick and Rob Hanigan for the find and for donating the specimen to the ""Amgueddfa Cymru""  National Museum of Wales.

During its lifetime, about 201 million years ago, D. hanigani likely hunted or scavenged meat with its tiny, pointy teeth that measured less than 0.4 inches (1 centimeter) long. However, its teeth weren't yet full size. A bone analysis suggests that D. hanigani was likely a juvenile, largely because most of its bones had not yet fully formed or fused together, the researchers said.

Given its young age, D. hanigani was a shrimp compared with other theropods. Though its distant relative, Tyrannosaurus rex, stood up to 13 feet (4 meters) tall and measured up to 40 feet (12.3 m) long, D. hanigani stood only about 2.3 feet (70 centimeters) tall and measured about 6.5 feet (200 cm) long.

The newfound dinosaur also sported a long tail, possibly to help with balance, the researchers said.

Little is known about dinosaurs during the earliest days of the Jurassic period, Vidovic added. ""This is some of the very best fossil evidence that we have for this time,"" he said.

There are earlier dinosaur fossils dating to the Triassic period (between 251 million and 199 million years ago) in the United Kingdom. But the timing of this early Jurassic skeleton is important: The end-Triassic extinction led to the demise of more than 75 percent of all marine and land life, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica. This extinction event, which wiped out so many others, likely helped dinosaurs diversify and multiply, Vidovic said.

""About 200 million years later, the [newfound] dinosaur looks a little generic, but at the time in the early Jurassic, it was quite new and different,"" Vidovic said. ""So the reason it might look a bit generic in hindsight is that loads of later dinosaurs repeated the winning formula.""

The study was published online today (Jan. 20) in the journal PLOS ONE.

Dorian Murray died Tuesday, according to a post on the boy's official Facebook page.

""He was surrounded by people who love him and his transition to heaven was very peaceful. He was embraced by both mom and dad,"" the post by family friend Kathryn Thomas said.

Dorian, of Westerly, was diagnosed with a rare and untreatable form of pediatric cancer, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ahl-VEE'-oh-lyr rab-doh-my-oh-sar-KOH'-mah), when he was 4. After cancer cells spread to his spinal fluid a few months ago, he and his family decided to stop his chemotherapy treatment so he could enjoy the time he had left.

Not long after, Dorian told his father he wanted to be famous in China before he went to heaven. His father, Chris, a police officer in Stonington, Connecticut, posted the wish on Dorian's Facebook page, urging people to use the hashtag #DStrong. It spread across the globe.

People from places as far away as Australia and Florida sent him photos and well wishes, and #DStrong became a trending topic on social media. It especially took off in China, where people sent photos of themselves on the Great Wall holding signs reading #DStrong. Dorian and his family also received invitations to travel to China, but declined due to his health.

The Rhode Island General Assembly declared Jan. 20 ""#DStrong Day.""

Dorian's family announced earlier this week that they planned to establish the Dorian J. Murray Foundation to raise money for pediatric cancer research and to help support families of children with pediatric cancer.

People in the community expressed sorrow at Dorian's death, including Roy Seitsinger Jr., superintendent of Westerly schools. He told families in a message that Dorian was a ""precocious, gregarious, and loving little boy,"" the Westerly Sun reported.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,"Frankie Edgar to Conor McGregor: If you want to silence the doubters, fight me",[],"Frankie Edgar has been asking to fight Conor McGregor for the past year. But despite a five-fight win streak, including four victories over top-10 fighters and another over a UFC Hall of Famer, he's still waiting for his shot at the featherweight champion.

Last weekend, Edgar watched McGregor get dealt his first UFC loss by Nate Diaz, but no matter how much he was personally invested in the outcome, he wasn't rooting for the Irishman's downfall.

""I'm not happy that he lost. I don't wish losses on anybody. The better guy is going to win the fight and that's just how it happens,"" Edgar told FOX Sports on Monday night. ""I was just happy that he has to come and defend that 145-pound title. I don't want to fight for a vacant title. I want to fight the guy who is the most recent champion. That was him. He's the champion of the division, and he never even defended it. Now he has to come and defend it.""

Edgar was actually working at the broadcast booth for FOX Sports during the UFC 196 card so not only was he watching the bout between McGregor and Diaz as a fighter, but he was examining the entire bout from an analytical stand point as well.

What he saw was McGregor get hurt, Diaz took over and the featherweight champion looked for a way out.

""You know he's got quit in him. Not trying to kick anybody when they're down but I think he's got some quit in him,"" Edgar said. ""We've seen it before with him, even before the UFC, when he's been submitted. I think no matter that choke was going to finish him but it seemed like he didn't give it time to fight or to try ride it out. He packed it in pretty quick. I'll give him credit for the way he handled his loss though.""

After the fight was over, McGregor immediately turned his attention back to the featherweight division after a failed experiment to move up a weight class and seek out a second UFC title.

Immediately, McGregor targeted Jose Aldo as his next opponent and his coach John Kavanagh doubled down on that idea in a recent interview as well. Aldo would obviously love that scenario, considering he got knocked out cold by McGregor in just 13 seconds when they met last December at UFC 194.

Aldo even took a few shots at Edgar over social media for the sake of trying to earn the rematch against McGregor later this year.

While Edgar isn't one to get into trash-talking battles with other fighters, he's happy to point out all the ways Aldo should step aside and get back in line for another shot at the featherweight title.

""I have a hard time calling someone a (expletive) that just beat me recently. Never mind beat me but just knocked him out in 13 seconds,"" Edgar said, referencing Aldo's Instagram post about McGregor following UFC 196. ""As far as me losing two fights to Benson (Henderson), a lot of people don't believe I lose those fights. Then he says I got a quick featherweight title shot without deserving it when what happened was I stepped in when someone got hurt and lo and behold, Aldo got hurt and we had to push it back. Surprise, surprise, Aldo got hurt so we had to rebook the fight.

""He's trying to get his so I get it, but I've got my five-fight win streak. I didn't just lose my last one. Who wants to see that fight? They just did two build-ups for that. I think people are sick of that. They want to see me and Conor. That's the read I'm getting.""

Obviously the UFC will have the final call in who gets the chance to face McGregor next, but Edgar isn't going to be quiet and just hope for the best.

He's already burning up the phone lines reaching out to UFC president Dana White to express his interest in facing McGregor later this year. Considering White already promised him a shot at the belt following his last win, Edgar is finally ready to cash in on that guarantee.

""I was told after I fought (Chad) Mendes, 'Frankie gets whatever he wants' and I still didn't get what I wanted,"" Edgar said. ""Now it's my chance again. Are they going to dog me again? Is Dana (White) going to dog me again and not give me this? He can't. He just can't.""

""I'm trying already. On the post-fight show I asked Dana right away, what's the deal? What's up with Conor? Who's getting him next? He said he didn't know. I've been texting him trying to set up a meeting. Eventually, we're going to get on the phone, hopefully this week.""

More than anything, Edgar wants McGregor to demand the fight with him because the Irishman will certainly influence the final decision.

For the past year, Edgar has been the fly in the ointment whenever McGregor talks about being the best in the world because he still hasn't fought the former lightweight champion. Many people believe that Edgar is the featherweight that can beat McGregor in the octagon and he knows that has to bug the current champion.

So rather than giving a rematch to a fighter he just dusted in less time than an NBA shot clock, Edgar has a personal message that he wanted to direct at McGregor when it comes time to book his next bout.

""Everyone's drinking the Conor Kool-Aid,"" Edgar said. ""It's easy to do. The media builds him up. The UFC builds him up and he does go out there and perform, but I see what Chad Mendes did to him. I see what Nate Diaz did to him. I know I can do those things.

""If you want redemption, go in there and fight the guy that poses a serious threat. Not the guy you just knocked out. He wants to prove to everybody this fight with Nate was a fluke? Fight a guy that can do the same thing to him. If Conor wants to show everybody he's the king like he says, fight me. If you want to silence the doubters, you don't do it against a guy you just beat. You do it against a guy that poses the biggest threat and especially after the way he lost on Saturday night. I can stand with Conor, too. That's the other thing. I'm not going to sit there and just wrestle (expletive) him.""",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Is a Cruz-Fiorina Ticket on the Horizon?,['Elizabeth Chmurak'],"Former Republican rival and Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina officially endorsed Texas Senator Ted Cruz on Wednesday at a rally in Miami, Florida. Fiorina, who suspended her own presidential campaign last month, told Cruz supporters she checked his name at the ballot box in the Virginia primary last week.

It is my great honor to be here today to tell you why I voted for Ted and why I will work hard to make sure he is our Republican nominee and our next President of the United States, said Fiorina.

Fiorina, who promoted herself as an outsider candidate with business experience, told the audience Cruz is the candidate that stands for conservative principles and will never settle for the status quo.

It is time to unite behind Ted Cruz my fellow conservatives, my fellow Republicans, my fellow citizens. It is time to take our party back. It is time to take our government back. It is time to take our country back, said Fiorina.

Ford OConnell, a Republican strategist and advisor to the 2008 McCain-Palin campaign, says with Fiorinas support people are beginning to see the GOP field as a two-person race between Cruz and billionaire businessman Donald Trump.

All the bigger name Republicans are starting to pick sides. Clearly with Carly Fiorina, Im sure there would be place in the cabinet if Cruz wins the nomination, but overall Carly Fiorina is looking to stop Trump and legitimize Cruzs case, said OConnell.

Fiorina, who was the only female GOP candidate in the 2016 race, tried to position herself to be the conservative alternative to Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Throughout her campaign she took shots from GOP frontrunner Donald Trump about her business record and her looks. Those comments backfired on Trump, turning off some Republican female voters, which OConnell says Cruz is poised to gain.

This will help soften Ted Cruzs image who is among some of the remaining candidates for the War on Women meme in the election and it will also help broaden his appeal, said OConnell. As this gets down to a two-man race, he needs a surrogate out there to broaden his appeal and connect with women.

OConnell says Cruz hasnt really attracted female voters with his extreme conservative message but says with Fiorinas backing he could capture some of the fence sitting voters who still have hesitations with choosing between Cruz and Trump.

According to Public Policy Polling in February, Cruz had 23% of the female vote compared to Florida Senator Marco Rubios 39% support and Trumps 28%.

Fiorinas endorsement comes on the heels of Cruzs latest primary win on Tuesday; The state of Idaho rounded out his seventh victory. The next primary contests on March 15 include Florida and Ohio, two winner-take-all states.",[]

The death was one of six killings on a violent Tuesday in the city.

The violence began in the afternoon when police say a 55-year-old man entered a Cricket Wireless store and stabbed a man in the chest who was paying his bill. The man then fled and climbed into a car and stabbed the driver in each hand. Police say the man, who hasn't been identified, headed to a nearby mechanic and stabbed a 30-year-old man in the chest who was watching repairs on his car. Police say that man collapsed in the road and later died from his injuries.

The two other victims drove themselves to a hospital and were in stable condition. The suspect was taken into custody, still holding the knife, but has not been charged.

""They're clearly unprovoked attacks at this point,"" Philadelphia Police Lieutenant John Walker told WCAU-TV. ""We're not sure what the motivation is behind this male.""

A few hours later, investigators say gunfire broke out in another part of the city, leaving one man dead and another in critical condition.

Over the next several hours, police say four more men were killed in four separate shootings.

No arrests have been made in any of the shootings.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Yellowstone bison sent to slaughter as park trims herd,[],"Yellowstone National Park started shipping many of its famous wild bison to slaughter Wednesday to drive down the size of the park's herds and respond to concerns by the livestock industry over a disease carried by the animals.

Thirty animals have been shipped to slaughterhouses, and officials plan to send an additional 120 in the next few days. The bison were weighed and tested for disease for research purposes, and the remaining animals were crowded into holding pens to await shipment.

The park's actions are driven by an agreement in 2000 with Montana officials that requires it to control its bison herds. The meat will be distributed to American Indian tribes that traditionally subsisted on bison.

""Nobody here wants to be doing this,"" park spokeswoman Jody Lyle said after the bison were prodded into trailers for shipment. ""It's time for a change.""

About 150 of the animals have been captured this winter trying to migrate out of the park in search of food at lower elevations in Montana. Ranchers worry about bison infected with brucellosis, a disease that can cause cattle to abort their young.

There have been no recorded bison-to-cattle transmissions of brucellosis, and critics say the slaughters are unnecessary. Captured bison that test negative for it are not spared.

""This is not OK. It's really that simple,"" said Stephany Seay with the Buffalo Field Campaign, a bison advocacy group.

Rick Lamplugh said he moved last May from Oregon to the small town of Gardiner, at the northern entrance to the park, in large part for the wildlife viewing opportunities. The park and state agencies need rethink their policies on bison so they can be ""treated like any other wildlife,"" he said.

Tens of millions of bison, also known as buffalo, once roamed North America. Commercial hunting drove the species to near-extinction in the late 1800s before conservationists  including former President Theodore Roosevelt  intervened when only dozens were left.

Yellowstone is home to one of the few remaining wild populations. Millions of tourists visit the park each year to see the animals, a top attraction at the nation's first national park. The animals also are the symbol of the National Park Service.

Since the 1980s, worry over brucellosis has prompted the killing of about 8,200 park bison, most of them sent to slaughter. In recent years, state, federal and tribal agencies have tried to emphasize public hunts that occur just outside the park's boundaries.

Hunters so far this winter have killed more than 400 of the animals, said Andrea Jones with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. That's the most since 1989. The vast majority were shot by members of American Indian tribes that have treaty hunting rights in the Yellowstone region.

Detracting from the hunt's success has been an unprecedented number of animals that were merely wounded and retreated to the park after being shot.

Up to 50 wounded bison were killed by state and federal wildlife agents, Jones said.

The park had 4,900 bison at last count, well above the 3,000 dictated under the agreement. Park officials set a goal this year of removing 600 to 900 of the animals. More shipments to slaughter are possible in coming weeks if large groups of bison move into Montana, although a mild winter has reduced this year's migration compared with previous years.

During the past decade, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and his predecessor moved to allow bison into areas adjacent to the park. Yellowstone administrators have supported those efforts, but they say they are bound under the 2000 agreement to keep the bison herds in check.

Alternatives  such as transferring some Yellowstone bison to lands outside the park  are under consideration but unlikely to take effect soon. Park workers are holding back from slaughter about two dozen bison calves for potential future placement elsewhere if the opportunity arises, park spokeswoman Amy Bartlett said.

If that doesn't happen, the animals will be slaughtered, she said.",[]

""We are using information we have learned for operations, one official said. The captured operative was identified as Sleiman Daoud al-Afari.

He told U.S. interrogators ISIS had converted banned mustard gas into powdered form to launch in artillery shells, The New York Times adds.

Just yesterday, defense officials said U.S. warplanes in Syria targeted and likely killed an ISIS leader who served essentially as the terror group's secretary of defense.

The Iraq raid marks one of the first known major success of Washington's more aggressive policy of pursuing jihadis on the ground. The Obama administration launched the new strategy in December, deploying a commando force to Iraq that it said would be dedicated to capturing and killing ISIS leaders in clandestine operations, as well as generating intelligence leading to more raids.

U.S. officials said last week the Delta Force team had captured an Islamic State leader but had refused to identify him, saying only that he had been held for two or three weeks and was being questioned.

Iraqi officials said al-Afari worked for Saddam Hussein's now-dissolved Military Industrialization Authority where he specialized in chemical and biological weapons. They said al-Afari, who is about 50 years old, heads the Islamic State group's recently established branch for the research and development of chemical weapons.

He was captured in a raid near the northern Iraqi town of Tal Afar, the officials told The Associated Press. They would not give further details.

The weaponized mustard gas that ISIS has developed would not be concentrated enough to kill, but could badly wound its victims, a defense official told The Times.

An initial assessment of the U.S. airstrike conducted in Syria last week showed that it likely killed commander Omar al-Shishani, also known as Omar the Chechen, along with 12 additional ISIS fighters, officials added.

Beyond intelligence value, the capture in Iraq could strike a blow to what Iraqi and American officials have described as a determined effort by the Islamic State group to develop chemical weapons.

A Mideast watchdog released photos in 2014 suggesting the terror network seized chemical weapons from Saddam Hussein's old stockpiles and deployed them on ethnic Kurds in neighboring Syria. The Kurds apparently were killed by ""mustard gas or some kind of blistering agent, the Middle East Review of International Affairs told Fox News at the time.

ISIS was believed to have set up a special unit dedicated to chemical weapons research, made up of Iraqi scientists from the Saddam-era weapons program as well as foreign experts who joined the group. Iraqi officials expressed particular worry over the campaign because ISIS gained so much room to operate and hide chemical laboratories after overrunning around a third of the country in the summer of 2014, joined with territory they controlled in Syria.

Iraqi officials say the group has ambitions to develop more dangerous agents like nerve gas, though the U.S. has said it appears still far from that goal. Tests confirmed mustard gas was used in a town in Syria when ISIS was launching attacks there in August 2015.

The United States has been leading a coalition waging airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria for more than a year. The campaign has been key to backing Iraqi and Kurdish forces that have slowly retaken significant parts of the territory the militants had seized.

But after coming under pressure at home for greater action against the militants, the Obama administration moved to the tactic of stepped up commando operations on the ground.

Last year, U.S. special forces killed a key ISIS leader and captured his wife in a raid in Syria, but the new force in Iraq was intended as a more dedicated deployment. American officials have been deeply secretive about the operation. Its size is unknown, thought it may be fewer than 100 troops.

""This is a no-kidding force that will be doing important things,"" was about all Defense Secretary Ash Carter would say about the force in testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee in December.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Health apps often lack privacy policies and share our data,[],"Just because a health app has a privacy policy doesn't mean the data will remain private, an analysis of mobile tools for diabetes suggests.

In fact, privacy policies appear rare, and when they do exist, most state that user data will be collected and half warn that medical information will be shared with third parties.

""Simple privacy policies can help patients protect their personal information, but only 19 percent of the apps in our study had a privacy policy available pre-download,"" said lead author Sarah Blenner, who did the study at ITT Chicago-Kent College of Law and is currently a public health researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.

""App developers avoid privacy policies because they want to be able to share health information to advertisers without the knowledge of the users,"" Blenner added by email.

One-fifth of smartphone owners had health apps in 2012, and 7 percent of primary care physicians recommended a health app to their patients, Blenner and colleagues write in their report in JAMA.

To get a sense of how well patient privacy is protected by apps for managing chronic disease, the research team focused on one common condition - diabetes.

They analyzed 211 apps available for download in Google Play, the online marketplace for the Android operating system that powers about 83 percent of smartphones worldwide.

For the subset of 41 apps with any privacy policy at all, only four said they would ask users for permission to share data, the study found.

Slightly more than half of the apps with privacy policies said they would collect data when the app was used or when people registered for an online account.

Just six of these apps, or 15 percent, explicitly stated that they would not collect personal information from children.

Sixteen, or 39 percent, said user data may be used for advertising purposes.

One limitation of the study is that the analysis focused on privacy policies available prior to downloads, not features available within the apps, the authors note. The study also excluded apps made for iPhones.

Even so, the findings likely apply to a wide variety of apps for different types of diseases, said George Annas, director of the Center for Health Law, Ethics and Human Rights at Boston University School of Public Health.

""Most apps want to sell medical information to marketers and are likely to think fewer people would use their app if they knew this,"" Annas, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email.

""Only patients who think it is OK for their physicians to sell all or parts of their medical records are likely to agree to this practice,"" Annas added.

Generally, apps aren't required to have clear privacy policies and there's little incentive for them to provide specifics because it increases the odds that they could face liability for disclosing incorrect information, said Scott Kambler of KamblerLaw LLC in New York.

""Plus, we often see companies that just don't know what's happening with personal data,"" Kambler, who wasn't involved in the study, said by email. ""They code apps and send data to third party affiliates or partners, but they don't know what the third parties do with the data. In fact, the company offering the app may have hired a third party to develop the app and may not know what it does behind the scenes.""",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"OPINION: Hey, Republicans, Stop Hating on Trump Voters",[],"By Stephen Moore | Fox News Opinion

Will Republicans please stop insulting Trump voters? Just stop. I know that many hate Trump, but his voters too?

Mitt Romney derides Trump voters as suckers. Others have sneered that Trump has an army of low information voters who have been duped, and that these people shouldnt be able to decide on the fate of a Grand Old Party. Trumps voters, the political class screams, have hijacked the Republican Party.

Another conservative commentator complained the other day that many of these voters have never even voted before and they are not even Republicans. Huh?

Isnt it a good thing that Trump is steering millions of new voters away from the Democrats and attracting them to the GOP? I thought we were told Republicans lost in 2012 because so many conservatives stayed home. Here they are.

RELATED: Krauthammer: Why Trump is Winning the Values Voters

The GOPs mighty establishment wing  the people who get rich off the game of politics -- pretend that theirs is the party of the working class, of blue collar virtue, and hard work, but now that the workers they supposedly represent are in revolt, apparently the problem is the voters not the party. This is insanity.

This is like the executives at Coca Cola blaming the stupid public for not liking New Coke. What kind of a company blames its customers when things go wrong? Inside Washington, there are no term limits on stupidity.

Former House Republican majority leader Tom DeLay advised on Fox this past Friday that Republicans should do all they can to stop Trump from getting a majority (though he will likely have a plurality) and then at the convention, throw Trump and his troublemaking voters under the bus and pick someone who got millions of fewer votes than Trump did. Delays point is that the party and its delegates, not the voters, should choose who the nominee is. He seemed to be saying: its our club and we make the rules. (Funny, Republicans just a few weeks ago were guffawing that Democrats had rigged their primary process.)

The rules of the party apparently say that Delay is right. So the master plan is to let the elites decide whats best for us.

Gee. I thought thats what liberals do!",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Sanders camp sees opportunity as Southern state voting wraps,[],"Bernie Sanders is showing no signs of slowing down after pulling off an upset victory in Michigan and sees an opportunity ahead to gain ground, as his campaign suggests one of Hillary Clintons biggest built-in advantages is about to become irrelevant.

To date, Clintons firewall of Southern states has delivered her a string of victories, most recently in Mississippi. Across the Deep South, black voters who make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate there went overwhelmingly for Clinton.

But after Florida and North Carolina hold primaries next Tuesday, the Southern states are done voting. The map shifts to the Midwest and beyond  and in those states, the black voting bloc is not so large.

Sanders, who closed what virtually every pre-election poll showed was a double-digit deficit against Clinton in Michigan, made clear after his surprise victory that hes looking to repeat that success in other Rust Belt states starting next week.

We look forward to going to Illinois, Ohio, Missouri and the other states, Sanders told reporters.

Sanders upset win in Michigan could fuel tensions Wednesday night at a debate being held at Miami Dade College.

The two already were meeting with their manners in question. The competitors cranked through their previous face-off just days earlier and emerged complaining of disrespectful conduct.

Now, Sanders sees an opening and Clinton is more determined than ever to clear him out of the way.

Sanders campaign officials made the case Tuesday night that the Vermont senators attacks on Clintons support for free trade deals had an impact in the Michigan race, and likely will be effective in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri. And they maintained that Clintons advantage in the South goes away after next Tuesday, as rural voters in other states, including the West, taking a closer look at their candidate.

Among the upcoming contests are Utah, Idaho, Arizona and Washington state.

To date, Clinton has been helped immensely by her dominating performance in Southern states, where minority voters overwhelmingly broke for her.

And thanks to their support  and just as important, the support of unpledged superdelegates -- Clinton still enjoys a huge overall delegate lead. Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri stressed Tuesday that their campaigns strategy focuses on winning delegates, and noted theyd pick up more delegates than Sanders from Tuesdays contests regardless of the Michigan results.

As of Wednesday afternoon, Clinton had 1,221 delegates to Sanders 571. The former secretary of states advantage remains daunting for her insurgent rival.

Even as Sanders looks to the Midwest and West for support, both campaigns will compete next week for Florida, where polls show Clinton well ahead.

But before those delegates are at play, Clinton and Sanders will meet for their eighth debate in the Sunshine State where 99 Democratic delegates are at stake, as well as bragging rights in the most hotly contested battleground in U.S. politics.

Floridians have picked President Obama in the past two elections, and former President George W. Bush twice before that. The Sunshine State is also home to the infamous hanging chad election drama of 2000, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided the race in Bushs favor.

Wednesdays one-on-one will be hosted by Univision News and The Washington Post, and aired on CNN.

Coming less than 24 hours after Sanders Michigan win, the debate gives both candidates a chance to make their case to a key voting demographic  the Latino community  and tackle controversial issues like immigration reform and border security.

Clinton is expected to press Sanders on his comment from their last debate which critics said made it sound as though only non-whites live in poverty. When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto, you don't know what it's like to be poor, he said.

Sanders, who has tried to make inroads with black voters, sought to mop up after the debate by saying he only meant that many white people aren't aware of the pressures and police oppression facing black Americans.

He also bristled: ""I don't want to be lectured about talking poverty whether it's white, black, Latino. Nobody in this campaign has talked about it more.""

The candidates are also likely to take on police, race and gun violence.

The death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin, who was killed in 2012 in Sanford, Fla., during an altercation with neighborhood watch volunteer George Zimmerman, remains a wound that won't heal among blacks. Zimmerman was acquitted of second-degree murder.

Martin's mother, Sybrina Fulton, has campaigned with Clinton to reduce gun violence. And Clinton has gone after Sanders for voting against longer waiting periods for gun purchases.

Another prickly topic up for debate is health care.

More than 1.7 million Floridians have enrolled in Obama's health care law this year, with South Florida having one of the highest enrollment levels in the nation.

Clinton supports the law and wants to fix it. Sanders wants to push for universal health care in a government-financed system.

foxnews.com,2015-10-24 00:00:00,Why you should wrap your keys in aluminum foil,[],"Your car is always listening. Not for your voice, like the Amazon Echo or Siri, but for an electronic signal, such as the coded ""unlock"" signal from your electronic key fob. If it's a newer car model, you might not have to press any buttons; just approach your car and the doors will unlock automatically. In some cars, the engine will even turn on.

Wirelessly unlocking your car is convenient, but it comes at a price. Criminals can easily intercept the key fob's signal and open your car without setting off any alarms. If you have a true keyless car model, they might be able to just drive away. Let's look at how criminals pull this off and what you can do to keep your car safe.

How your car's security system works

As you've probably noticed, you can't just open your car with any old radio signal. You need your specific key fob to do the job, and there's a reason.

A key fob uses a computer chip to create a unique code that it sends to your car's security system. The car also has a chip that uses the same algorithm to generate codes. If the codes match up, the car opens. There's a bit more to it, but those are the basics.

How criminals attack #1

Since each key fob/car security pair is unique, and each one can create billions of codes, hackers shouldnt stand a chance. But it turns out that a popular system from Megamos Crypto isn't as secure everyone thought.

Researchers at Radboud University in the Netherlands and the University of Birmingham found that by intercepting the wireless signal just twice, they could narrow down the possible combinations from billions to just 200,000. After that, a computer can figure out the code in just half an hour and unlock the car.

In a real-world application, a thief could sit on a street and gather wireless signals as car owners enter and exit their vehicles. Then overnight they could steal a number of cars. Click here to find out if your car is at risk from this kind of attack.

Still, it takes a skilled car thief or hacker to carry out this kind of attack, so the odds of it happening to you are slim. But thanks to always-on key fobs, there's another risk that's much more likely to happen.

How criminals attack #2

Always-on key fobs present a serious weakness in your car's security. As long as your keys are in range, anyone can open the car and the system will think it's you. That's why newer car models won't unlock until the key fob is within a foot of them.

But for less than $100, criminals can get an amplifier that detects key fob signals from up to 300 feet away and then transmits them to your car. In other words, your keys could be in your house, and criminals could walk up to your car and open it. This isn't just a theory; it's actually happening.

Steps to stop car thieves

Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to keep hackers from stealing your signal. You can buy a signal-blocking pouch that can hold your keys, like the Hack-Blocking Card Pouch I sell in the Komando Shop.

If you dont want to spend any money, you can stick your key fob into the refrigerator or freezer. The multiple layers of metal will block your key fob's signal. Just check with the fob's manufacturer to make sure that freezing your key fob won't damage it.

If you're not hot on freezing your key fob, you can do the same thing with your microwave oven. (Hint: Don't turn it on.) Stick your key fob in there, and criminals won't be able to pick up its signal. Like any seasoned criminal, they'll just move onto an easier target.

Since your key fob's signal is blocked by metal, you can also wrap it up in aluminum foil. While that's the easiest solution, it can also leak the signal if you don't do it right. Plus, you might need to stock up on foil. You can also make a foil-lined box to put your keys in, if you're in a crafting mood.

You should also be aware that this kind of signal stealing isn't a problem just for car key fobs. Newer passports and other I.D. cards contain radio frequency identification chips that enable criminals to use a high-powered RFID reader to steal your information from a distance. You don't need aluminum foil, however. Explore the line of stylish RFID-blocking wallets, purses and passport cases I sell in the Komando Shop.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,The Real Winners and Losers from the March 8 Primaries,[],"EXCERPT FROM THE WASHINGTON POST:



Winners

*Donald Trump: The talk of the last few days -- especially here in Washington -- centered on the possibility of the Trump bubble having, finally, burst. Two national polls released on Tuesday showed him with a shrunken lead over Ted Cruz; many people looked to Michigan and Mississippi to see if Trump might underperform or even lose in those two states. Nope! Michigan was called for Trump as soon as polls closed across the Wolverine State at 9 p.m. Eastern Time and Mississippi was called for him just 30 minutes after polls closed there. The Mississippi exit polls are instructive as to Trump's dominance. Trump won those who identified as ""very"" conservative, ""somewhat"" conservative and moderate/liberal. That's, well, all of them.

This was a night that sets up Trump perfectly for March 15 when, if he wins Ohio and Florida, the race will be effectively over. He will almost certainly be the momentum candidate going into those states next week. And the struggles of Marco Rubio -- more on that below -- only make Trump's path easier.

* Bernie Sanders: Yes, the Vermont senator got destroyed in Mississippi. But, in the bigger and high-profile state of Michigan, Sanders heavily overperformed polling that showed Clinton ahead by 20 points or more. Winning a big Midwestern state is of deep symbolic importance for Sanders, who was on the verge of being cast as a nuisance candidate by many Democrats.



On the night Michigan and Mississippi Democratic voters went to the polls, candidate Hillary Clinton said she was proud of the campaigns she and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) are running. Meanwhile, Sanders expressed confidence that Democrats would ""beat Mr. Trump"" in November. (Sarah Parnass/The Washington Post)

Sanders may have also found an issue where he can do real damage to Clinton as the campaign goes forward. Almost six in 10 Michigan Democratic primary voters said international trade takes away U.S. jobs, according to exit polling. Among that group Sanders won by roughly 20 percentage points over Clinton. That could -- and should -- bode well for his efforts in Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin and other states where international trade has ravaged the economy. ""What tonight means is that the Bernie Sanders campaign... is strong in every part of the country,"" Sanders said in brief remarks in Florida Tuesday night. ""We believe our strongest areas are yet to happen.""

Sanders had previously pledged to stay in the race through the June 7 primaries and, as I've noted, he has plenty of money to do so. Now he has even more reason to do so.

*Paul O'Neill: The former Yankee (and Reds) outfielder was in attendance at Trump's rally in Florida. And, of course, Trump cajoled an endorsement out of the former slugger and then spent the rest of his victory press conference touting O'Neill's support. I -- and most of the rest of the country -- probably hadn't thought about Paulie in years. But, on Tuesday night, he was back on center stage.

* Trump, the Brand: Trump Steaks! Trump Water! Trump Wine! Trump Magazine! Trump Golf Club! Trump celebrated himself during his victory speech/press conference on Tuesday night. Not only did he bring steaks, water and wine to his rally, he spent a good chunk of his actual speech talking about how great they are and how successful each of his businesses are. It was surreal -- until you stop and remember this is Donald Trump we're talking about.

*Abe Lincoln: ""Very presidential,"" according to Trump. I am sure Honest Abe would have loved Trump wine if he had ever got the chance to try it.



Losers

* Marco Rubio: Oomph. Rubio finished WAY off the lead in Michigan and Mississippi and looked to be in very serious danger of not qualifying to win a single delegate from either. (A candidate needs 15 percent statewide to get delegates in Michigan and Mississippi.) Even as those terrible results were coming in, Rubio continued to insist that Florida was the only state that mattered.

Well, um, ok. It was hard to see Rubio winning Florida before Tuesday night. It's even harder to imagine him winning it now since the next seven days will be filled with questions about a) whether he is staying in the race and b) whether he should stay in the race. Rubio, who is still in his early 40s, has to consider his future -- and fast. Losing Florida -- particularly if he loses badly -- could damage Rubio's political career going forward on both the state and national level.

* Mitt Romney: The 2012 nominee claimed credit for slowing Trump down after the votes on Saturday -- telling ""Meet the Press"" host Chuck Todd on Sunday that his speech discrediting the former real estate mogul mattered. Um, maybe not? Michigan, as you might remember, was a state that Romney's father, George, represented as governor and one that Mitt won in the 2008 and 2012 GOP primaries.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-04 00:00:00,7 Ways to Create Quiet in Urban Gardens,[],"Your garden should be your own private place for solitude. Noise contributes to how peaceful a garden feels, and unwelcome noise from highway traffic, busy streets or mechanical systems can put a damper on your outdoor serenity, especially in urban settings. A garden that is a dedicated quiet space can be a private retreat from the hustle and bustle of city living.

You can change the noise level in your garden with a few simple design tweaks. As we move into winter, now is a great time to plan and strategize how you can implement these ideas or enjoyment next spring.

Identify, with as much accuracy as you can, where the noise is coming from and how its reaching your backyard or courtyard. Whether the noise you are trying to block is ambient, like adjacent highway traffic, or single-source, like a neighbors air conditioner, the tips here can help you create quiet in the garden.

Browse Through Thousands of Inspirational Garden on Houzz

Plant in vertical layers. Think about the entire vertical space and perimeter to block noise from disturbing you in your garden. Plant different woody and evergreen species in vertical layers: upright trees and grasses as the tallest layer, shrubs and sprawling plants as the middle layer, and shorter perennials and ground covers as the bottom layer. Living walls and hanging gardens can help you achieve vertical layering with limited space.

Fill containers with many types of plants. If you are limited to planting only in containers, use all of the available real estate in your pots, planting each one fully.

A large container can have a small tree, low grasses and trailing vines all planted in it. Combine plants to achieve as much vertical layering as you can to reduce noise.

Revamp Your Outdoor Space With New Planters

Plant columnar plants. You can plant a living hedge in narrow garden spaces using upright, columnar trees. Some popular tall and skinny trees that provide quick vertical vegetation include columnar varieties of red maple (Acer rubrum Columnare, USDA zones 4 to 8; find your zone), Slender Silhouette sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua Slender Silhouette, zones 5 to 10) and European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus Columnaris, zones 4 to 8). Columnar plants are bred to grow upright, and they can be maintained as skinny hedges with regular pruning.

Plant densely. Think about how you can create a bubble of vegetation that surrounds your space to block out sound. Dense vegetation, planted as a sound barrier around your garden, will filter some of the noise.

Trees in 5- or 10-gallon sizes can be planted 10 feet apart to dampen sound and mimic a woodland setting. They will grow more upright, instead of branching out wide, as they compete for light. Plant the perimeter of your property thickly with trees, but leave open space in the middle to allow sunlight in. Small multistem trees are good candidates for this type of planting in small spaces: Consider birch (Betula spp.), serviceberry (Amelanchier spp.) and native hollies like possumhaw holly (Ilex decidua, zones 5 to 9) or yaupon holly (Ilex vomitoria, zones 7 to 9).

Bring new, pleasant sounds to your garden. One way to drown out unpleasant noise is to actively create pleasing sounds. Water is a simple way to do that. You dont have to use a lot of water to create sound, and there are many products that are suitable for small spaces. Water can create many different sound effects, including bubbling, fizzing, pouring, flowing, dunking and spraying.

Music works, too. Sometimes just having a radio outside, turned low so that you are being a good neighbor, can help drown out the noise.

Design Your Landscape for Peace and Quiet

Create one dedicated quiet space. If surrounding your entire courtyard or urban garden with dense plants is not feasible, make one quite spot in your landscape by surrounding and enclosing just that one area.

Use sound-absorbing materials. Every surface in your outdoor space, especially if it is small, is going to either amplify or absorb sound. Consider each surface and how that surface can be changed to absorb sound instead of reflect it. Your outdoor furniture should have soft elements, like outdoor-rated, weather-resistant cushions and textiles. The ground is a big amplifier of sound in small urban outdoor areas  especially when its made of concrete, metal or stone paving. Integrate as many areas for ground covers as possible, either planted in the ground or in wide containers, to create a textured surface of plants that absorbs sound.",[]

Michelle Obama plans to attend the funeral in Simi Valley, California, but the president will instead be in Austin, Texas, for the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival, a popular interactive mash-up of music, tech and film.

Obama is set to deliver a keynote speech.

Obamas decision immediately drew fire from some conservatives, with former 2012 Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann calling the move self-centered and classless.

Self-centered, classless Obama misses another funeral of a high profile conservative. https://t.co/oKKXE5iOtz  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) March 9, 2016

The controversy comes after Obama chose not to attend the funeral of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in February  a move that was heavily criticized by many on the right.

KT McFarland, former Defense official in the Reagan administration and a Fox News national security analyst, knocked Obama on Twitter for skipping the funerals of Nancy Reagan, Scalia and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

That's petty, petulant & lowclass, she wrote.

Democratic presidential candidate and former first lady Hillary Clinton, as well as former President George W. Bush, plan to attend.

Obama, though, hardly is setting a precedent by missing the funeral of a former first lady.

The Clintons did not attend the funeral of Pat Nixon in 1993. In 2007, President George W. Bush did not attend the funeral of Lady Bird Johnson, though he had no scheduled events that day.

And in 2011, Obama did not attend the funeral of former first lady Betty Ford.

President Carter also did not attend the funeral of Mamie Eisenhower in 1979, while President Reagan did not attend the funeral of Bess Truman in 1982.



But presidents have attended such services in other cases.

President John F. Kennedy attended the funeral of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's widow, Eleanor Roosevelt, in 1962. When Jacquelyn Kennedy died in 1994, President Bill Clinton and then-first lady Hillary Clinton attended.

The Obamas still paid tribute to Mrs. Reagan on Monday, saying she had ""redefined the role"" of first lady and praising her advocacy for those suffering from Alzheimers.",[]

James Ryan was convicted in February in the death of Nassau County Officer James Olivieri in October 2012. Prosecutors said Ryan's reckless driving caused the chain-reaction crash that killed Olivieri.

The case was watched closely by legal experts, who said it was rare for someone other than a driver directly involved in a crash to be charged. The charges were based on the legal principle of ""causation/foreseeability,"" in which suspects are charged in events that are foreseeable results of their actions.

A jury found the 28-year-old Ryan guilty of 10 of 13 charges but acquitted him of the most serious one -- aggravated vehicular homicide. He was convicted on charges including aggravated criminally negligent homicide, vehicular manslaughter, drunken driving and reckless endangerment.

Ryan's Toyota hit a BMW on the Long Island Expressway after Ryan spent a night drinking in New York City. He then was hit by another car after stopping 1,500 yards down the highway. A few minutes later, an SUV driver smashed into Ryan's car before hitting Olivieri, who was out of his patrol vehicle talking to Ryan.

During the trial, defense attorney Marc Gann conceded his client had been drinking and had a blood-alcohol level of 0.13, which is higher than the state's threshold of 0.08. But the attorney said the SUV driver failed to avoid crashing into the wreckage from Ryan's earlier accident. That driver was never charged.

Melissa Click, in a statement Tuesday, insisted her Feb. 25 dismissal by the university system's governing curators was unfair by failing to follow the normal, on-campus procedures for reacting to faculty misconduct. More than 100 state lawmakers, mostly Republican, had called for her removal.

""In their decision to terminate my employment, the curators bowed to conservative voices that seek to tarnish my stellar 12-year record at MU,"" Click wrote. ""Instead of disciplining me for conduct that does not 'meet expectations for a university faculty member,' the curators are punishing me for standing with students who have drawn attention to the issue of overt racism at the University of Missouri.""

Click, whose firing followed her suspension in January, added that the governing board ""is using me as a scapegoat to distract from larger campus issues, but their termination of my employment will not remedy the environment of injustice that persists at MU.""

A spokesman for the curators, John Fougere, said Tuesday that board had no comment.

Click's statement came a day after the American Association of University Professors announced that three members would visit the Columbia campus later this month to investigate the process leading to Click's firing and whether it violated her right to due process and ""whether conditions for academic freedom and tenure at the institution are sound.""

Click's supporters have questioned the curators' move, by a 4-2 vote, to decide Click's fate rather than allowing the school to use its normal, on-campus procedures for reacting to faculty misconduct.

""The AAUP's action underscores my belief that the curators have overstepped their authority,"" Click said Tuesday.

In voicing support of 45-year-old Click's firing, top university administrators cited her run-ins with police during October protests in Columbia and with two student journalists weeks later on the Columbia campus, including a videotaped confrontation where she called for ""some muscle"" to remove a videographer from the protest area.

During the October matter, Click was recorded telling police to get their hands off students during a protest, then hugging the students and cursing at an officer who grabbed her.

The protests, spurred by what activists said was administrators' indifference to racial issues on campus, prompted the Columbia chancellor and system president to resign after the protests escalated, with one student's hunger strike and an announcement by members of the football team that they would refuse to play.

Click has said she regretted her actions, claiming her actions were meant to safeguard protesters from retaliation. But in Tuesday's statement, she wrote that ""I will not apologize for my support of black students who experience racism at the University of Missouri.""",[]

Fingerprint reader codes are stored on the phone and are not able to connect to the internet or other systems. Apples phones are very secure. They keep hackers out. They run reliably.

But because the phones keep hackers out, they make it harder for the government to break in during an emergency.

In the case at hand, one of the San Bernardino terrorists used an iPhone and the government wants access. Apple has given the government what it can give, but has not given direct access to the phone because it is not in Apples powers to give it. They designed the phone that way. They did not design a phone for terrorists, they designed a phone for consumers in an unsafe world where even super secure government servers can get hacked.

The federal magistrate wants Apple to redesign its software to make it less secure, less safe, and more easily hackable. Today, in an open letter, Apple is declining to do so. I agree with Apple.

There are lots of terrible people out there from terrorists to child pornographers who might want an iPhone because they think the government will not be able to get access. But there are vastly more people out there who want to hack into my phone.

The government cannot keep its own servers secure. If the government gets a backdoor to my phone, it will not be able to keep the backdoor to itself.

I support Apples relentless pursuit of consumer privacy. Bad people are always going to do bad things. But good people should not see their privacy reduced as a result.

The tree-sprouting masterpiece is now up for sale at a list price of $8.2 million. It sits on 706 acres, took a decade to build, and has never been lived in.

But ... why? The owners, who finished the 8,881-square-foot home late last year, had a change of plans and decided to head to Hawaii. Whoever they are, they're going to remain mysterious. Listing agent Kendra Ratcliff of Luxe Platinum Properties says they ""want to stay under the radar for now.""

The decision to leave a house where, according to Ratcliff, ""so much had to be created and built by hand"" is a bit baffling. But we're fascinated by the home's delicious details.

The grand staircase, for example, has handcarved manzanita branches for the railings and balusters. Custom-cut pieces of glass have been fitted between the crooking branches, held in place by tiny clips.

""When you have to create something like that, it takes months and months,"" Ratcliff says.

As you approach the house you'll see massive Brazilian mahogany front doors handcarved by local artist Russell Beebe. He incorporated Native American themes and depicted animals such as eagles and coyotes in his work.

A covered entryway topped with a conical Chinese roof is propped up by two tree sculptures carved from copper. Inside, a floor made from four different types of wood resembles a flowing river as it ebbs against the curved walls and stone planters.

""The goal was to have no straight walls,"" says Ed Bemis, the general contractor who worked on the home since the beginning. ""The floor plan almost looks like a landscape plan. There's lots of bent and shaped glass, a lot of rock work.""

But most of the ""wow"" factor of this house comes from the organic use of wood. Tree trunks sprout from the kitchen floor to support the island. Branches crawl over parts of the walls and ceiling like vines. A smaller staircase is made completely of wood, with one long log twisted and curved for support.

Some of the windows in the two-bedroom home are cut to look like clouds and pine trees. The main fireplace features two thin dragons, kissing and forming a heart. Adjacent to the main house is another building which houses an ""endless pool"" -- a swimming pool where jets push the swimmer back, so you can swim without reaching one side.

All around the 706-acre property you're surrounded by endless views of Oregon mountains, including the potentially active volcano, Mount Shasta.

""The place has a good feeling about it,"" Bemis says. Despite great vibes, we asked him about the challenges that come with such an intricate, long-term project. ""Just like any task that you do, you figure out what you want to do and you work your way toward finishing it,"" he says. ""It was fun.""",[]

Continue Reading Below

The Wall Street Journals John Carreyrou was already a two-time Pulitzer Prize winning investigative journalist when he won a Polk award for his reporting on Theranos. Hes recently been out telling the story behind the story  how he broke through the hype surrounding the Silicon Valley unicorn and its iconic founder, Elizabeth Holmes.

Its not every day that a reporter gets to expose the celebrated CEO of a high-flying tech startup as having no clothes, not to mention saving the public from healthcare technology that doesnt live up to its claims. And Theranos appears to be unraveling at a rapid pace since he broke the story.

The latest news is that Walgreens is actively seeking a way out of its agreement with Theranos. The pharmacy giant wants to close the 40 Theranos wellness centers in its Arizona stores and distance itself from the PR nightmare before it tarnishes the companys brand. That follows a similar move by Safeway last year.

And while Theranos has previously announced several partnerships with big-name healthcare providers such as the Cleveland Clinic and San Francisco-based Dignity Health, none of those relationships have gotten off the ground.

Just last week, Holmes pulled out of a conference talk at the last minute, apparently under advice that she not speak publicly. Considering that shes been featured everywhere from the cover of Forbes and Fortune to the New Yorker and the New York Times, Id say its a little late for that.

Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

Theres an old saying: if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then its probably a duck. Well, from Carreyrous groundbreaking Journal stories and recent in-depth interviews, one thing comes through loud and clear. Theranos is under fire for a very good reason: its technology is not ready for primetime. And I wouldnt be the least bit surprised if it never is.

ICYMI, after a decade in stealth mode, Theranos burst on the scene making exciting claims of breakthrough technology that can quickly process the full range of laboratory tests from a few drops of blood drawn from a finger prick at a fraction of the cost of traditional labs like Quest Diagnostics.

The company raised more than $750 million, most recently at a $9 billion valuation, from big name venture capitalists like Draper Fisher Jurvetson and private investors like Oracle chairman Larry Ellison. It had an impressive if not eclectic board of directors that included former Secretaries of State George Schultz and Henry Kissinger.

And Holmes, a Stanford dropout who founded the company at 19, became an instant entrepreneurial icon; drawing comparisons to Apple cofounder Steve Jobs in front-page stories, appearing on Charlie Rose, being named to the Harvard Medical School Board of Fellows and being awarded an honorary doctorate from Pepperdine.

In October of last year Carreyrous blockbuster front-page expose called into question the efficacy of the companys supposedly disruptive technology, the accuracy of its testing and its purported transparency in dealings with federal regulators. Thats when the FDA and CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) began to investigate Theranos and all hell broke loose.

At this point, the Palo Alto-based company is only approved to use its massively hyped proprietary technology to run one test, the HSV-1 for Herpes Simplex. Thats not exactly worthy of a $9 billion valuation in my book.

But Carreyrous recent interviews filled in a lot of blanks for me: How did Holmes get so many big-name companies and board directors behind her vision? How did she raise so much money at such a high valuation? How did she garner so much media attention for technology that cant deliver on its claims?

The answer is disturbing. Holmes may have something in common with Jobs after all: the iconic CEOs much heralded reality distortion field.

It appears that investors ponied up megabucks, executives signed lopsided agreements, elder statesmen joined the board and the media wrote glowing stories  all based on little more than the vision of one remarkably charismatic individual, Holmes. Everyone bought into the science, sight unseen.

The technology has never been vetted, certainly not to the extent of Holmes extraordinary claims. There have been no peer-reviewed data or papers. Top executives of Safeway and Walgreens negotiated directly with Holmes without appropriate due diligence. And the investors were far more familiar with software than health sciences.

Then theres the disturbing account of Ian Gibbons, the chief scientist who spent eight years at the company and collaborated on 23 of its patents. Then, in 2013, Gibbons committed suicide. Before taking his life, which his widow believes was related to his work at Theranos, he repeatedly told her that nothing was working.

To put that in perspective, understand that she went on the record even after being threatened with legal action by Theranos and against her own economic interest, since she owns considerable equity in the company. And Carreyrou found her account to be entirely credible.

For their part, Holmes and Theranos have vigorously defended their claims and aggressively confronted their detractors. Theyve accused the Journals reporting of being inaccurate, misleading and defamatory in statements on the companys website. And until recently, Holmes has kept a relatively high profile.

Ive heard some characterize Holmes behavior in the face of an existential crisis for her company as denial or delusional. Its hard to argue with that assessment. In an interview with Glamour last year, Holmes said, I was very blessed to grow up in an environment in which I was encouraged to believe that there was nothing I couldn't do.

Its that extraordinary self-belief that brought Theranos to this place. Perhaps Holmes still believes that shes going to pull this off. When the Journal story first broke, Holmes said in an interview, This is what happens when you work to change things. First they think youre crazy. Then they fight you. And then all of a sudden you change the world.

Thats the problem with reality distortion fields. If you want to change the world, then sooner or later, you have to deliver the goods. You have to have the talent and technology to back up your vision. For Holmes and Theranos, sooner would be better than later. Time is running out.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Strong encryption finds unlikely allies,[],"While the public interest in backdoors has been centered on the FBI's court battle with Apple, a larger fight has been brewing amidst security and policy professionals for years. Law enforcement has repeatedly asked for cryptographic backdoors to prevent communications between criminals from ""going dark."" But the rousing response in favor of strong encryption and against backdoors has brought together seemingly intractable enemies, from the Secretary of Defense to hackers and many in between.

Traditional Enemies

Last week's RSA conference was the backdrop for several discussions about backdoors into encryption. Current and former administration officials, along with security researchers, were asked whether encryption systems should be accessible to law enforcement.

Mike McConnell, former director of the NSA, took pains to paint himself as a traditional opponent to privacy issues. At one time, he was ""all for espionage,"" and reminded the audience that he was a proponent of the Clipper Chip, an encryption system with a built-in backdoor. His opinion changed, however, when he began working in the private sector, and discovered advanced malware being used to steal intellectual property, allegedly at the behest of the Chinese government.

""Ubiquitous encryption is something this nation needs to have,"" said McConnell.

McConnell was also pointedly critical of law enforcement's belief that encrypted communications will enable crime and terrorism. ""Law enforcement is enabled by plain text,"" he said. ""But we actually had criminal prosecution before we had telephones.""

Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, meanwhile, couched his opinion on strong encryption on moral grounds. ""Security without privacy is protecting an empty treasure chest,"" he said. ""The values that we're protecting would simply be evaporating.""

Chertoff also said that strong encryption is especially important when critical industries, like power generation, could potentially need to repel attacks. ""We've been telling [industry] the responsibility is on you,"" said Chertoff. ""So if we're going to ask the private sector to be partners, whether it's information or operating controls systems, we need to give them the tools to complete the mission.""

That sentiment of encryption as a valuable tool at all levels was also the basis of Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter's assertion that he is ""not a believer in backdoors or a single technical approach to a complex problem."" Carter said that the Department of Defense uses the same encryption systems as everyone else, and that without strong encryption there is no way to secure communications between tanks, ships, and so on.

Much of the argument against backdoors in encryption systems hinges on the possibility of unauthorized access to those doors. In this context, the backdoor meant to enable law enforcement or intelligence gathering becomes a major vulnerability when in the hands of an attacker. This is usually a hypothetical situation, but security researcher and one of the minds behind the Signal app, Moxie Marlinspike, argued that it might have already happened.

He pointed to Dual_EC_DRBG, a psuedo-random number generator endorsed by the NSA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which contained a backdoor. The flawed generator was in use on Juniper Systems servers, which was secretly hacked and had control of the backdoor presumably placed in the hands of the attackers. Marlinspike pointed out that these servers were possibly in use at the U.S. Office of Personnel Management at the time of the massive OPM breach.

""It's entirely possible that a U.S. backdoor was used to gain access to a U.S. system,"" said Marlinspike.

One of the traditional defenders of privacy fully agreeing with these traditional opponents was Nuala O'Connor, the President and CEO of the Center for Democracy and Technology. O'Connor said America needs to start working on privacy protections that will be meaningful when everything is connected.

""My personal device, my connected home, my connected car, and government systems, and our critical infrastructure; all off those are interconnected and to break encryption in any part of that chain affects national security,"" she said.

What About Apple?

But while nearly everyone was in lockstep about encryption, not everyone agreed about Apple. It's important to note that the FBI has argued that it is not asking Apple to break its encryption system. Rather, the agency has requested that Apple disable a feature that would allow the FBI to brute-force the PIN code locking the phone.

A few at RSA commented that Apple and the FBI picked a bad case to test the waters for these issues. ""Apple goofed several ways,"" said Adi Shamir, one of the co-inventors of the RSA algorithm. He pointed out that the FBI had a strong case in that the owners of the phone were already dead and their guilt in a horrific action firmly established. ""The FBI had been waiting for a long time to find the perfect issue from their perspective,"" he said. Though he made clear that he did support backdoors, he felt Apple should comply in this case and find a more favorable court case to press these issues.

And while support from the technology community for Apple was strong, the support from the government was unsurprisingly nonexistent. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch was unequivocal in her remarks, tearing Apple's constitutional arguments apart. Secretary Carter voiced his support for encryption, but was careful to point out that he could not comment on the Apple case, which he described as a law enforcement, not defense, problem.

But among the technology professionals, support seemed strong for Apple. ""The real reason we're having this discussion today is because Apple tried to make products that protect their users, which is unusual while most companies try to sell out [user] data at any turn,"" said Marlinspike.

Marlinspike went on to argue that in this case, the FBI is effectively trying to engineer away people's ability to break the law. Whitfield Diffie, one of the two inventors of public key encryption, agreed, saying, ""The difference between a free society and totalitarianism of course being responsible for your action. But in tyranny, you build mechanism to prevent them from having their action.""

The Path Forward

Nearly all of the prominent individuals who spoke on the subject maintained that the case of Apple and the FBI should not be the single discussion about backdoors or weak encryption. Instead, many held that the discussion should happen at the congressional level and not in the courts.

McConnell suggested that the technology sector be tapped to help lead the discussion in government. He called for the creation of a legislative commission to advise in the creation of new laws on encryption. ""The public at large is not informed on this issue, just like when we went through the 9/11 commission to have a more engaged dialog for how we go forward,"" said McConnell.

Chertoff, like many this week, insisted that the technology sector had to work with government to find the best solution. ""People from the security community, the privacy community, and the public want the same thing: a secure Internet, control of their data, and the benefits of technology without worrying about harm.""

O'Connor agreed, saying that the discussions ""should be in the legislative branch and they should be transparent."" She and others emphasized the point that there is, in fact, much to agree about in terms of encryption and security. ""I'm always profoundly optimistic and surprised that we're all able to find more common ground,"" concluded O'Connor.

Highway Patrol officials told the Kansas City Star that Pablo Antonio Serrano-Vitorino was arrested in Montgomery County, Missouri. He was found lying on a hill just north of Interstate-70 and no shots were fired, according to The Star.

""He looked exhausted,"" Sgt. James Hedrick said.

The suspect had a rifle with him, but federal law barred him from legally owning a gun because he is in the country illegally, according to John Ham, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives office in Kansas City.

Online court records show he was charged Wednesday in Montgomery County, Missouri, in the death of 49-year-old Randy Nordman. Nordman was shot Tuesday at his rural home near New Florence, about 70 miles west of St. Louis.

Serrano-Vitorino is also charged with four counts of first-degree murder in Kansas. Authorities there say he gunned down a neighbor and three other men late Monday before fleeing. Investigators haven't discussed a possible motive for the attacks.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said in a statement late Tuesday that Serrano-Vitorino was a Mexican national who was held at the Overland Park, Kan. Municipal Court on Sept. 14. The fingerprinting generated an ICE detainer, but the agency was erroneously issued...to the Johnson County Sheriffs Office, instead of the Overland Park Municipal Court.

The Department of Homeland Security said that Serrano-Vitorino was released from custody without ICE being notified, though they did not elaborate on why. ICE also confirmed that Serrano-Vitorino had been deported back to Mexico in 2004, but had since returned illegally.

It was not clear when he returned to the U.S.

The widespread manhunt for him, which started Monday, included helicopters, police dogs and at least one SWAT team. One of the four men shot that day managed to call police before he died, but it's unclear how the men knew each other or what may have prompted the shooting, Kansas City police officer Thomas Tomasic said.

A truck Serrano-Vitorino was believed to be driving was found about 7 a.m. Tuesday morning alongside Interstate-70 in central Missouri.

About 25 minutes later, sheriff's deputies responded to a shooting about 5 miles away at a Montgomery County home and found the body of 49-year-old Nordman, according to the patrol.

Highway Patrol Lt. Paul Reinsch said a witness who called 911 reported seeing a man running from Nordman's property, launching a manhunt of that area.

Reinsch said investigators weren't aware of any connection between Serrano-Vitorino and Nordman, whose home is near his family's campground and a racetrack for remote-controlled cars.

Police have not released the names of the four victims, but relatives identified three of them to the Kansas City Star as Mike Capps and brothers Clint and Austin Harter.

foxnews.com,2016-01-07 00:00:00,Dinosaurs may have performed bird-like dances to attract mates,['Michael Casey'],"Some dinosaurs may have engaged in courtship rituals similar to ostriches and other birds, a finding that could shed light on the poorly understood mating behavior of these giants.

The evidence comes from a series of scrapes that were uncovered in 100 million year old Dakota sandstone at four sites in western Colorado. These ancient scrapes from Cretaceous therapods are similar to a behavior known as nest scrape display or scrape ceremonies among modern birds, where males show off their ability to be good mates by digging up pseudo nests for their prospective partners.

Related: Ancient marine reptiles flew through the water

These are the first sites with evidence of dinosaur mating display rituals ever discovered, and the first physical evidence of courtship behavior, Lockley, a University of Colorado Denver geology professor and a co-author on a study of the findings in Scientific Reports Thursday, said in a statement. These huge scrape displays fill in a missing gap in our understanding of dinosaur behavior.

Related Image Expand / Contract Team leader Martin Lockley (right) and co-author (Ken Cart) kneel beside two large Cretaceous-age scrapes from western Colorado that are the first physical-reported evidence that large theropod dinosaurs engaged in courtship behavior. (M. Lockley )

Lockley, who also is a world-renowned expert on dinosaur footprints, found evidence of more than 50 dinosaur scrapes, some as large as bathtubs, in an area where tracks of carnivorous and herbivorous dinosaurs have also been confirmed. The display arenas, also called leks were found in two National Conservation Areas (Dominguez-Escalante and Gunnison Gorge) on property permitted by the Bureau of Land Management near

Evidence of mating areas were also discovered by Lockley at Dinosaur Ridge, a National Natural Landmark, just west of Denver.

Related: These dinosaurs liked to get their feet wet

Since it was logistically difficult to remove the scrapes, the researchers turned to technology for help. They created 3-D images of the scrapes using a technique of layering photographs called photogrammetry. They also made rubber molds and fiberglass copies of the scrapes  which are being stored at the Denver Museum.

Until now, theories abounded about dinosaur sex including that it was driven by sexual selection and the idea that male dinosaurs in prehistoric times looked for mates and drove off weaker rivals. Females, meanwhile, would have selected the biggest and strongest mates  much as we see in the animal kingdom today.

The problem was there was no physical evidence  until now.

The scrapes, which the researchers believe were most likely associated with territorial activity during the breeding season, demonstrate that the mating behavior is similar to birds - which makes sense since they are descended from dinosaurs.

The scrape evidence has significant implications, Lockley said. This is physical evidence of pre-historic foreplay that is very similar to birds today. Modern birds using scrape ceremony courtship usually do so near their final nesting sites. So the fossil scrape evidence offers a tantalizing clue that dinosaurs in heat may have gathered here millions of years ago to breed and then nest nearby.

Related: 'The Good Dinosaur': Could humans and dinos coexist?

Initially, the authors considered several possible reasons for the scrapes  including a nesting site, territorial markings or evidence that the dinosaurs were digging for food.

They ruled out the nesting site because they found no eggs while the food theory suffers from the fact that such behavior probably would have resulted in deeper digging and pooling that would wash out scrape marks in sandy sediments.

As for the scrapes done to mark territory, the researchers said it was unlikely since this behavior is found in mammals but not known in water-conserving uricothelic reptiles and birds.

That leaves the mating behavior, which the authors said was consistently supported by the evidence and is similar to the rituals of several modern bird species including ostriches, puffins and shorebirds like Wilsons plover.

Thomas E. Williamson, curator of paleontology at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science who did not take part in the study, told FoxNews.com that the findings were interesting especially because so little is known about the mating rituals of dinosaurs.

Related: Study sheds fresh light on early relatives of dinosaurs

Williamson said that it is suspected that dinosaurs must have had a rich repertoire of behaviors related to mating and/or territoriality based on the elaborate skull ornamentation, colored plumage, and other structures that many dinosaurs have. Some were using these structures to visually recognize and communicate with others of their own species, he said, while others dinosaurs such as lambeosaurine hadrosaurs (crested duck-billed dinosaurs), probably communicated through acoustic displays using resonating tubes on their heads.

Williamson agreed that dinosaur behavior must have been similar to birds and their other closest living relatives, crocodilians. Both groups use complex behaviors for territorial and courtship displays and based on this, it is likely that dinosaurs did too.

However, this new evidence is really something special. Tracks, such as the unusual ones described in this paper, provide actual physical evidence of dinosaur activity  and similar activity appears to be present in some modern birds, he said in an email interview. This suggests that some of these behaviors can be traced far back into the dinosaurian heritage of birds. This really brings some of these animals to life!",[]

A defense official, who had knowledge of drone use inside the U.S. and spoke to Fox News, detailed several missions: Helping first responders extinguish forest fires in California in 2013; assisting in two search-and-rescue missions in California in 2015; helping stop recent flooding in Mississippi and South Carolina.

In those cases, requests were made by organizations such as FEMA, the California Office of Emergency Services and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers



""We felt like we could help,"" said the official, who had

knowledge of the military's drone use inside the U.S. ""We were

supporting first responders.""



But that explanation differed from the description of the drone program in a USA Today report that portrayed the unmanned aerial vehicles as being used to ""spy over U.S. territory.""



USA Today, which first reported in-depth about the flights on Wednesday, cited a Pentagon inspector general report that was recently made public by a Freedom of Information Act request as the source of most of its information.



That report said fewer than 20 such flights had occurred between 2006 and 2015 and all had been lawful.

The document provided no details of any approved mission. One example of a request, however, indicated an unidentified mayor asked the Marine Corps to fly a drone over his city to find potholes. The request was denied because it did not make operational sense.

Under 2006 guidelines established by the Pentagon, military drone use for civilian missions had to be approved by the secretary of defense or someone delegated by the secretary, USA Today reported. No defense secretaries have ever delegated that responsibility, according to the report. In 2015, those rules were altered so that only the secretary of defense could grant approval for missions, and drones could only be flown for testing or training.

North American skywatchers may feel left out by Tuesday's event and the upcoming African eclipse, but their time is coming.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Suspect in two-state killing spree arrested in Missouri,[],"A man suspected of killing five people across Kansas and Missouri was arrested early Wednesday morning after an extensive manhunt, the Missouri Highway Patrol said.

Highway Patrol officials told the Kansas City Star that Pablo Antonio Serrano-Vitorino was arrested in Montgomery County, Missouri. He was found lying on a hill just north of Interstate-70 and no shots were fired, according to The Star.

""He looked exhausted,"" Sgt. James Hedrick said.

The suspect had a rifle with him, but federal law barred him from legally owning a gun because he is in the country illegally, according to John Ham, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives office in Kansas City.

Online court records show he was charged Wednesday in Montgomery County, Missouri, in the death of 49-year-old Randy Nordman. Nordman was shot Tuesday at his rural home near New Florence, about 70 miles west of St. Louis.

Serrano-Vitorino is also charged with four counts of first-degree murder in Kansas. Authorities there say he gunned down a neighbor and three other men late Monday before fleeing. Investigators haven't discussed a possible motive for the attacks.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) said in a statement late Tuesday that Serrano-Vitorino was a Mexican national who was held at the Overland Park, Kan. Municipal Court on Sept. 14. The fingerprinting generated an ICE detainer, but the agency was erroneously issued...to the Johnson County Sheriffs Office, instead of the Overland Park Municipal Court.

The Department of Homeland Security said that Serrano-Vitorino was released from custody without ICE being notified, though they did not elaborate on why. ICE also confirmed that Serrano-Vitorino had been deported back to Mexico in 2004, but had since returned illegally.

It was not clear when he returned to the U.S.

The widespread manhunt for him, which started Monday, included helicopters, police dogs and at least one SWAT team. One of the four men shot that day managed to call police before he died, but it's unclear how the men knew each other or what may have prompted the shooting, Kansas City police officer Thomas Tomasic said.

A truck Serrano-Vitorino was believed to be driving was found about 7 a.m. Tuesday morning alongside Interstate-70 in central Missouri.

About 25 minutes later, sheriff's deputies responded to a shooting about 5 miles away at a Montgomery County home and found the body of 49-year-old Nordman, according to the patrol.

Highway Patrol Lt. Paul Reinsch said a witness who called 911 reported seeing a man running from Nordman's property, launching a manhunt of that area.

Reinsch said investigators weren't aware of any connection between Serrano-Vitorino and Nordman, whose home is near his family's campground and a racetrack for remote-controlled cars.

Police have not released the names of the four victims, but relatives identified three of them to the Kansas City Star as Mike Capps and brothers Clint and Austin Harter.

James Ryan was convicted in February in the death of Nassau County Officer James Olivieri in October 2012. Prosecutors said Ryan's reckless driving caused the chain-reaction crash that killed Olivieri.

The case was watched closely by legal experts, who said it was rare for someone other than a driver directly involved in a crash to be charged. The charges were based on the legal principle of ""causation/foreseeability,"" in which suspects are charged in events that are foreseeable results of their actions.

A jury found the 28-year-old Ryan guilty of 10 of 13 charges but acquitted him of the most serious one -- aggravated vehicular homicide. He was convicted on charges including aggravated criminally negligent homicide, vehicular manslaughter, drunken driving and reckless endangerment.

Ryan's Toyota hit a BMW on the Long Island Expressway after Ryan spent a night drinking in New York City. He then was hit by another car after stopping 1,500 yards down the highway. A few minutes later, an SUV driver smashed into Ryan's car before hitting Olivieri, who was out of his patrol vehicle talking to Ryan.

During the trial, defense attorney Marc Gann conceded his client had been drinking and had a blood-alcohol level of 0.13, which is higher than the state's threshold of 0.08. But the attorney said the SUV driver failed to avoid crashing into the wreckage from Ryan's earlier accident. That driver was never charged.

In one such case from 1994, a New York City man was convicted of murder in the death of an officer who had been chasing after him in a robbery investigation and fell to his death through a skylight.

Quinones-Hinojosa  or Dr. Q.  was born in a small village outside of Mexicali. When he arrived to the U.S. in 1987, he did not speak English and worked as a farmhand outside of Fresno, California.

He saved up enough money for English classes and then saved up enough to attend school.

According to THR, eventually Quinones-Hinojosa attended Harvard Medical School to become a celebrated brain surgeon and cancer researcher.

In addition to his post at the Brain Tumor Surgery Program, Dr. Q's is also Director of the Pituitary Surgery Program at Johns Hopkins Hospital and Associate Professor of Neurological Surgery, Associate Professor of Oncology.

""At this point, our detectives have kind of exhausted all of our initial possible leads that we had,"" Mesa police spokesman Steve Berry said. ""We have had no success in locating either Mom or Dad for this child.""

The 7-pound-8-ounce infant remained hospitalized, but doctors said she appeared to be healthy. Police estimate she was hours old when she was found, Berry said.

James and Roseanne McCulloh said their son spotted a baby carrier on top of an irrigation box Tuesday morning while he was standing on the front porch. He then gently removed a metal panel that was on top of it.

""I saw him jump 20 feet, and he said 'There's a baby in it,' "" Roseanne McCulloh said. ""I ran over there. She wasn't blue. I touched her little arm and I opened up the blanket. She was just beautiful.""

The girl was wrapped in a blanket but there was nothing else in the carrier. The couple brought her inside and called 911. Roseanne McCulloh warmed up a blanket in the microwave while her husband wiped the baby down. Emergency responders showed up and transported the girl to the hospital.

Roseanne McCulloh said she believes the baby was left there around 2 a.m. She said her daughter recalls hearing noise from their irrigation box through her bedroom window around that time.

Mesa police are asking anyone who may have been in the area Tuesday morning to come forward, Berry said. Investigators want to speak with anyone who remembers seeing a woman or a vehicle or anything suspicious.

Arizona has a Safe Haven Law that allows a person to leave a newborn at certain locations such as fire stations, hospitals and churches without fear of criminal prosecution. Police are wondering why the parents essentially left the baby on the sidewalk when there is a fire station about half a mile away, Berry said.

""Fortunately, the homeowner did happen to come out to the house and discovered the baby.""

The infant, who police are calling ""Baby Jane,"" is described as either Hispanic or Native American with black hair.

If nobody claims the baby, she will be put into the custody of the Arizona Department of Child Safety and likely placed in a foster home.

foxnews.com,2016-02-18 00:00:00,Tom Ridge: Why Apple should reconsider on San Bernardino court order,['Tom Ridge'],"Several years ago I attended a dinner ceremony in New York honoring Americas heroes in Federal law enforcement. At the time the NSAs surveillance program was under attack in the aftermath of the Snowden revelations. As I walked into the gala that night several reporters stopped me to ask for my thoughts on the NSA. My answer apparently surprised them because it ended up making headlines the next morning: Ex-Homeland Secretary says I dont want the NSA looking at my emails.

I didnt then, and I still dont. I objected to reports that an NSA surveillance program had given agency operatives the green light to look at the emails of American citizens without probable cause. It was an overreach of a program that began in the months after 9/11 when I served as advisor to the president on Homeland Security.

I share this anecdote today because it not only underscores my record of protecting privacy, it will help you to better understand why I hope Apple CEO Tim Cook will reconsider his opposition to the court order to unlock an iPhone used by a suspect in the San Bernardino terrorist attack.

Mr. Cooks open letter to Apple customers, in which he explains the companys rationale, is both thoughtful and sincere. He raises valid concerns about the dangerous precedent that would be established should Apple work with the FBI to unlock this particular phone. I would agree such a danger would exist if the federal government were asking for broad powers to unlock phones without hard evidence or approved warrants. However, that is not the case in this situation.

It is one thing for Apple to oppose, on privacy grounds, providing back doors to the FBI regarding consumer phones generally. But in this case, we know the heinous acts committed by the San Bernardino terrorists. Fourteen people were murdered. When we know that a particular individual has committed a crime  as we know here  it is a wholly different matter. It is logical to assume that there are phone numbers and other information on that iPhone that could very well lead to co-conspirators and perhaps prevent other attacks.

Earlier this month, Twitter announced it had suspended 125,000 ISIS-related accounts. Facebook has also started to take steps to help combat terrorism.

I applaud such efforts and was pleased to see that leaders of our tech giants recently agreed to sit down with administration officials to take a more proactive approach to dealing with the growing scourge of terrorism and their use of technology. This situation underscores the need for the broader tech community and government to come together to prevent known terrorists from hiding behind technology.

While I strongly believed the NSA was overreaching in its review of emails, I see no such overreach by the FBI in their investigation in California. Nor do I see a threat to Apple customers broadly  like me  who will continue to benefit from the strong privacy shields Apples programmers have developed.

I believe Mr. Cook when he says he has no sympathy for terrorists and that he thinks Apple customers will agree with his position. Yet in opposing this court order, and in the wake of events in places like Paris and San Bernardino, can terrorists now conclude they have an ally in Apple? I believe Apple customers in this instance are able to separate the need to protect their privacy with the needs of law enforcement to defend all of us from future terror attacks.

Rubio on the CNN story his advosors want him to drop out of the race.

RUBIO: It is just false. They just made it up. There is no other way to describe it other than the fact that they made it up. And in fact they have now gone back and said they have one source, not in the campaign, but someone who knows someone who knows someone. I mean, it is just crazy the things people make up these days. Its not new. You see some other campaigns pushing that stuff but it is just patently false.

RUBIO: I think it has been proven as false. Not a single person has come out and said, No this is true. This is me who they were talking about. I mean it is just false.

GOV MIKE HUCKABEE FROM KNF EARLIER IN THE SHOW: If a news organization is going to make that allegation they need to name their sources...

RUBIO: Thats right. Its what happens, unfortunately. Heres what happens with a lot of these reporters, they are all dying to break a story and so they guess and if they are right, you know, they will be heroes and if not, there is no accountability they just move on. They are all like, we had one source and that is enough. The point is, it aint true. It is a lie. It looks like Ted Cruzs campaign is putting out emails in places like Hawaii, telling people about it and you saw that with Ben Carson earlier. Its just not true. Right now nobody has a clear path to the 1237 delegates.

KILMEADE: I did not know there was a Ben Carson-style rumor taken as fact to try to dissuade those in a caucus.

RUBIO: Yea, and they dont start voting until 11 PM Eastern. Look, we put that out. There is an email from the Cruz campaign spreading that around. It has happened before. It is unfortunate and the kind of thing they have done throughout the campaign. It is just not right but it happens. We cleared it up and we moved on. It has no impact on our campaign at the end of the day.

On Donald Trump...

RUBIO: You are starting to see all the problems in his background. The democrats are going to shred him. They are going to eat him alive. If you nominate Donald Trump, not only will you divide the republican party we are going to lose badly to Hillary Clinton.

Rubio on if the strategy is to get to the convention and keep Trump from the needed 1237 delegates for the nomination

RUBIO: I dont think anybody is on pace to get to 1237, including Donald Trump. He would have to win half the remaining delegates and he is not on pace to do that. Most of the states remaining are not winner take all, they are proportional. So even if he wins, he is not taking all the delegates tonight, neither is Ted Cruz. No one tonight is going to walk away (with all the delegates). Florida is a big deal, 99 delegates, one big chunk, I think if Donald Trump wins Florida, then it starts looking like, maybe you cant stop him.

Rubio on if he has sought out Jeb Bush for his endorsement

RUBIO: I dont every discuss private conversations with friends or anyone else. Suffice to say Governor Bush is someone I respect very much, I would love to have his support but I am not going to discuss any private conversations or anything like that.

KILMEADE: It has taken place?

RUBIO: I called him after the election but beyond that, I just dont want to talk about the content of conversations or how many times they happen, its just not a good practice and I am not going to do it.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,10 spring QB battles that could define the 2016 college football season,[],"Spring football doesn't get a ton of buzz -- after all, spring games don't count in the standings -- but the battles fought in the spring go a long way to winning games in the fall.

So when it comes to the most important position on the field, quarterback, there's no question that every rep, whether it's in the spring or the fall, matters.

With that in mind, here are 10 of college football's most interesting QB battles this spring:

Alabama

Spring game: April 16

The Crimson Tide lost their starting quarterback, their Heisman Trophy-winning running back, and a whole lot of talent to the NFL following their National Championship triumph, but they're the odds-on favorites to win the title again next season.

Junior Cooper Bateman, who started a game for the Tide last year, is the proverbial favorite to win the Tide's starting quarterback job, but David Cornwell, Blake Barnett, and early enrollee Jalen Hurts are in the thick of things as well.

Seeing has Alabama waited until SEC play to resolve their quarterback battle last year, there's no reason to think this year's competition will be short-lived.

Michigan

Spring game: April 1

Jim Harbaugh's team surprised many by winning 10 games in his first year, which was supposed to be a rebuilding campaign.

Expectations have been raised for 2016, and now the Wolverines need to figure out who will replace Jake Ruddock at quarterback.

The favorite is Houston transfer John O'Korn, a pro-style signal caller who, like Rudock, is a graduate of Florida powerhouse St. Thomas Aquinas.

Rudock backups Shane Morris and Wilton Speight are expected to get strong looks as well. Alex Malzone redshirted after being a key piece of Harbaugh's first recruiting class and will join the fray as well. And don't sleep on early enrollee Brandon Peters in all of this -- along with O'Korn, he was brought in by Harbaugh and could see some favoritism.

Harbaugh loves to test mettle through competition, and with five men in the fray for one job, this battle could last deep into fall camp.

Notre Dame

Spring game: April 16

Of the teams on this list, the Irish could be viewed as sitting the prettiest, as both quarterbacks vying for the team's top job are coming off impressive seasons.

But as the adage goes, if you have two quarterbacks, you have none, and Brian Kelly couldn't go wrong in picking either QB to start this season. That might make it difficult to pick one and stick with him.

Malik Zaire carried the starting job and some Heisman buzz into the start of 2015, only to fracture his ankle in a Week Two game against Virginia.

DeShone Kizer took the helm and completed 62 percent of his passes while throwing for 21 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. Notre Dame's close losses to Clemson and Stanford kept the Irish out of the playoff, but Kizer's strong performance put the junior neck-and-neck with Zaire heading into the spring.

This is one battle that could go deep into fall camp.

Auburn

Spring game: April 9

The Tigers weren't supposed to have a quarterback controversy this season -- after all, Jeremy Johnson was a Heisman favorite going into the 2015 season.

Well, Gus Malzahn has one now, and it's...messy.

Sean White took over for Johnson after the then-junior struggled early in the season, only for White to never find a rhythm with the Tiger offense. Johnson reclaimed the starting QB job and performed admirably in Auburn's final five games, scoring eight touchdowns and throwing only one interception.

The introduction of junior college transfer and former FSU quarterback John Franklin adds additional intrigue to the brew. Franklin, a South Florida-bred dual threat is called the ""presumptive favorite"" to win the job by AL.com, but as he's fighting two incumbents (of sorts) this competition could last longer than a few spring weeks. It'll certainly make the spring game interesting.

Florida

Spring game: April 8

This was meant to be a competition between Oregon State transfer Luke Del Rio and Treon Harris, with the latter likely moving to defensive back if he didn't win the job -- but seeing as Harris is being held out of spring practices for undisclosed reasons, this battle is now between Del Rio and early enrollee Feleipe Franks. Can either bring life to Florida's anemic offense?

TCU

Spring game: April 1

You remember Kenny ""Trill"" Hill, right? After receiving Heisman buzz early in the 2014 season, Hill lost his starting job and then left College Station before 2015 spring practices, landing in Ft. Worth.

If Hill can find his confidence again, he'll quickly be chosen to replace Trevone Boykin. But there's no guarantee of that, and 6-foot-5 sophomore Foster Sawyer, who started against Oklahoma last year, could push Hill for snaps.

Texas A&M

Spring game: April 9

To be honest, it's hard to keep up with who is actually on the Aggies depth chart at quarterback, seeing the position has been a revolving door for the last 12 months.

The post-Johnny Football era in College Station has been about as successful as Johnny Football's post-College Station era, and that has coach Kevin Sumlin feeling some heat. This quarterback battle could well determine Sumlin's future in maroon.

Oklahoma transfer Trevor Knight is the favorite in this battle, but Jake Hubenak, who started in the Aggies Music City Bowl loss to Louisville and had a few tantalizing moments, is no pushover. But seeing as Knight has only one year of eligibility remaining, it's hard to see him not landing the job.

Most of the intrigue in this battle will come from Sumlin and how he handles the decision. There's no right way to handle it, but Sumlin could hurt his own cause if he flip-flops on his No. 1.

Florida State

Spring game: April 9

Sean Maguire should be rolling into his redshirt senior season as Jimbo Fisher's main man, but all reports out of Tallahassee say that's not the case, as talented freshmen Malik Henry and Deondre Francois are going to be given shots at the QB1 role.

Maguire might thrive with the competition, or we may see the beginnings of a messy situation that could last into the fall.

USC

Spring game: April 16

This could be one of the more congenial quarterback battles this spring, but that doesn't mean it won't be hotly contested. Clay Helton, the quarterbacks coach for departing signal-caller Cody Kessler, is now the head coach in L.A., so there's continuity in the offense. Add in the familiarity factor -- the two main competitors for the starting job were both with the team last year -- and this should be a fairly straightforward process.

Former five-star recruit Max Browne, who was Kessler's scarcely used backup for the last two years, is the favorite to win the job, but redshirt freshman Sam Darnold impressed coaches last fall and provides more mobility at the position, which might appeal to Helton in his first full year in charge.

Texas

Spring game: April 16

Charlie Strong is entering a make-or-break year in Austin, and having a solid hand at quarterback is key to making sure expectations are met.

With the Longhorns moving to a Baylor-style spread offense this year, Strong has characterized the quarterback job as ""wide open."" Senior Tyrone Swoopes is the prohibitive favorite, but electrifying sophomore Jerrod Heard and true freshman Shane Buechele are in the running as well.

Given the system change in Austin, there's no reason to think this decision will come soon.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Democrats upset with GOP over 'pinata' comment about Supreme Court nominee,[],"Democrats accused Republicans on Tuesday of taking their cues from Donald Trump after the Senate's No. 2 Republican said President Barack Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court should expect to be treated like a ""pinata.""

Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said Republicans were ""acting like big, tough people threatening to destroy the reputation of a Supreme Court nominee they haven't even met yet.""

Reid and other Democrats denounced a comment by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, who told reporters late Monday that anyone nominated by Obama to the high court ""will bear some resemblance to a pinata.""

Reid called the comment beneath the dignity of the Senate and said it was a threat in the mode of insults and bullying by Trump, the GOP front-runner for president.

""They don't know who the nominee is. They don't know anything about the person, but they already have in their mind they are going to beat this person like a pinata,"" Reid said.

Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said Cornyn's comment sounded like a threat made by Trump, ""except I don't think he speaks Spanish.""

Cornyn said Tuesday that his comparison of the nomination and confirmation process to a pinata was ""only to say the confirmation process around here has gotten pretty tough.""

Cornyn added that he was ""not going to be preached to by the Democratic leader and by Democrats who've been responsible for filibustering judges, creating a new verb in the English language, 'Borked,' when they blocked Robert Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court"" in the late 1980s.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Cornyn's language ""sounds like he might spend a little too much time watching Donald Trump rallies.""

Cornyn's comments were not consistent with how most people believe the process of confirming a Supreme Court nominee should be handled, Earnest said.

The comments were ""an indication that Republicans are digging in even further in an unreasonable position of not giving that person any sort of fair hearing, and in fact vowing to try to tear this person down,"" Earnest said.

The dispute over Cornyn's comments came as Senate Democrats met with Patty Judge, a Democrat who is challenging Senate Judiciary Chairman Charles Grassley of Iowa. Judge, a former Iowa lieutenant governor, joined Senate Democrats Tuesday at a weekly luncheon.

The 82-year-old Grassley is widely popular in his home state and is favored to win a seventh term. However, the Democratic challenge will force him to spend money and deal with home-state criticism of Republican opposition to Obama filling the Supreme Court vacancy.

Reid said the Democratic challenger ""is one Judge Sen. Grassley can't ignore.""

Interviewed prior to her meeting with Senate Democrats, Judge said of Grassley: ""I believe that Iowans don't like it any better than I do. I'm an Iowan. This is not the way we operate. We believe in going to work every day, we believe that if you're assigned a task, you do the task. And I think he needs to hold those hearings.""

The event was established back in the 1900s and later recognized by the United Nations (UN) in 1975. The goal is to achieve gender equality for women worldwide, a mission that is still ongoing. The UN initiative helps raise awareness with a new theme each year, this year being, Planet 50-50 by 2030: Step It Up for Gender Equality. The year 2030 is the target to achieve gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls, as well as ensuring inclusive and quality education for all and promoting lifelong learning, according to a UN statement.

Social media is a buzz with people sharing how they are celebrating the day by tweeting a #PledgeForParity selfie, participating in IWD events or making donations to female focused charities.

Google (GOOGL) joined the celebration this year with their signature Google Doodle video showcasing the next generation of Doodle-worthy womenthe engineers, educators, leaders, movers and shakers of tomorrow. Google traveled to 13 cities around the world and asked more than 300 women to share their dreams by filling in the blank of the following sentence: One day I will ______ The result? An inspiring video featuring a diverse group of women including cameos from Anthropologist Jane Goodall, who says she wants to discuss environmental issues with Pope Francis, Nobel Prize Winner Malala Yousafzai and activist Muzoon Almellehan. Google is encouraging all woman inspired by the video to tweet their dreams with the hashtag #OneDayIWill.

To commemorate International Women's Day, Facebook partnered with Mihaela Noroc, a Romanian photographer and creator of the popular The Atlas of Beauty Facebook page, to highlight six women who are changing the world around them.

In Washington D.C., Together for Girls, an organization dedicated to ending the sexual violence and abuse of children and women, partnered with New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen on Capitol Hill to recognize International Womens Day.

Last month, Senator Shaheen introduced the Sexual Assault Survivors Act, legislation to establish basic rights across the United States for sexual assault survivors and empower them to pursue justice. A new petition on Change.org is calling on Congress to enact the legislation; It gathered nearly 50,000 signatures in just 24 hours.

Together for Girls hopes IWD will shed a light on sexual violence as a human rights violation on a global scale. The goal of the Every Hour Matters campaign is to increase awareness about the need to rapidly access post-rape care and calls on national and community leaders to ensure services are available in all communities.

Most people are unaware of the many services that can help survivors heal from the trauma of rape. Survivors have 72 hours to receive post-exposure prophylaxis that can prevent HIV and 120 hours to receive emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy. Depending on the circumstances, rapid treatment for trauma may also prevent other short- and long-term health consequences, said Michele Moloney-Kitts, director of Together for Girls.

According to Violence Against Children Surveys (VACS) in every country that was studied, approximately 25% of girls first sex is forced, and the majority of those cases occur before the age of 16. In the United States, an estimated 11% of high school girls report that they have been raped, and VACS notes the majority of those rapes go unreported. VACS is the first-ever national-level data on the prevalence of emotional, physical and sexual violence against children developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventions Division of Violence Prevention.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-06 00:00:00,"FGCU returning to NCAA Tourney, tops Stetson 80-78 in OT",[],"FORT MYERS, Fla. (AP) Zach Johnson sat out last season at Florida Gulf Coast for medical reasons, with doctors so concerned about his health that some wondered if he would ever play college basketball.

He's better than ever now - and he and the Eagles are headed to the NCAA Tournament.

Antravious Simmons scored 21 points and grabbed 12 rebounds, Johnson capped his 19-point effort by blocking a potential game-tying shot at the rim with four seconds left, and FGCU won the Atlantic Sun Conference's automatic berth to the NCAA Tournament by beating upset-minded Stetson 80-78 in overtime Sunday night.

''I'm just excited I can get the seniors a chance to go,'' Johnson said as FGCU players and fans swarmed the court in celebration. ''A lot of them haven't been. And me, I'm a freshman, I haven't had a chance to go.''

Next week, that'll change. FGCU became the fifth school to punch its ticket into the field of 68.

Marc-Eddy Norelia scored 16 and Christian Terrell added 15, including a spinning layup with 56.4 seconds left in overtime for FGCU (20-13), which is headed back to the NCAAs for the first time since the team's ''Dunk City'' crew made a stunning run to the Sweet 16 in 2013.

Derick Newton scored 22 for Stetson (12-22), which knew its season would end win or lose because the school is ineligible for the NCAA Tournament this season.

Grant Lozoya and Divine Miles each scored 11 for the Hatters, but Miles' layup was the one Johnson blocked in the final moments.

FGCU trailed for much of the second half before using a 10-0 run late in the regulation to build a five-point lead. But the Hatters - helped by a pair of big 3-pointers from Lozoya and Leo Goodman - closed the half on a 9-4 run, then forced Johnson into a contested miss at the rim with 6 seconds left to force overtime.

FGCU scored the game's first 10 points, a run that started with a dunk from Demetris Morant and ended with a dunk from Norelia. However, Stetson recovered and went on a 16-4 run to take its first lead on a 3-pointer by Goodman.

From there, the teams stayed close until the Hatters went on a mini run at the end of the first half to take a 35-30 lead.

Stetson was ineligible for the NCAA Tournament this year because of a subpar Academic Progress Report score, caused in part by the effect that two players who transferred to other schools had on that score. So if the Hatters won, the A-Sun would have seen regular-season champion North Florida get the automatic berth into the NCAAs.

TIP-INS

Stetson: The Hatters played 34 games this season, the most in school history. ... Stetson traveled nearly 3,000 miles in a seven-day span, going to Newark for the first round of the A-Sun tournament at NJIT, then from there to Nashville to face Lipscomb in the semifinals, back to its campus in DeLand, Florida and finally the short trip to Fort Myers for the final. ... Stetson plans to add one scholarship player for 2016-17, plus bring back all 12 of its current players.

FGCU: The Eagles are now 59-11 at home over the past four seasons. ... Redshirt senior Filip Cvjeticanin and assistant coach Michael Fly are the only members of the Eagles' roster and coaching staff who were at FGCU during the NCAA Tournament run in 2013. ...

Stetson was previously in the A-Sun title game in 1987 and 1994, losing both. FGCU has reached the A-Sun championship game four times in five years of eligibility since joining the conference, winning in 2013 and losing in 2012 and 2014.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,'He has fought: Fiorina endorses Cruz in Florida,[],"Former 2016 GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina resurfaced on the campaign trail Wednesday to endorse Ted Cruz, touting the Texas senators conservative credentials and arguing hes the only GOP candidate who can beat primary front-runner Donald Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton.

He has fought for our religious liberty. He has fought for our sovereignty, Fiorina said, before introducing Cruz at a campaign rally in Miami.

Fiorina, who dropped out of the 2016 race in February, called Cruz a leader and a reformer and took some shots at the primary front-runner in the process.

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin. Theyre not going to reform the system. They are the system, she said.

Her endorsement comes after Cruz walked away from Tuesdays primary contests with just one win, in Idaho, compared with Trumps three. The billionaire businessman won in Mississippi, Michigan and Hawaii, building his already substantial delegate lead over the field.

Florida, where Fiorina spoke, is among the five states set to vote next Tuesday and is one of the biggest battlegrounds.

Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive officer, said the argument that Cruz has made too many enemies on Capitol Hill only proves he is taking on the Washington cartel.

You have a very important job on Tuesday, said Fiorina, referring to Floridas primary, where Cruz is running behind Trump. Its time to take the party back. Its time to take our government back. Its time to take the country back. So its time to unite behind the only one who can, Ted Cruz.

Apple, in its petition asking the high court to hear the case, said the June decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York upholding a judge's ruling that Apple had conspired with the publishers contradicted Supreme Court precedent and would ""chill innovation and risk-taking.""

The 2nd Circuit's ruling followed a 2013 decision by U.S. District Judge Denise Cote after a non-jury trial that Apple played a ""central role"" in a conspiracy with publishers to eliminate retail price competition and raise e-book prices.

The Justice Department said the scheme caused some e-book prices to rise to $12.99 or $14.99 from the $9.99 price charged by market leader Amazon.com Inc.

DEAR REPUBLICANS, IT'S TED CRUZ

What is the rationale for Marco Rubios candidacy?

The latest poll out from the classiest and most reliable Florida pollster, Quinnipiac University, says there is none.



After a week of disappointing elections for Rubio, the Florida Q Poll is the dagger to the heart of his presidential aspirations. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush can be happy that while his own bid failed, at least he killed the one his campaign staff called ""Judas."" Enjoy Fisher Island.



The poll shows frontrunner Donald Trump doubling up Florida freshman Rubio with less than a week to go before the winner-take-all contest for 99 delegates. Coming after a disastrous election night it should be enough to send Rubio packing.



The only argument for Rubios continued candidacy was the Romney Plan in which voters should support any candidate in any race that can beat Donald Trump or deny him delegates. It worked pretty well in Michigan where Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas and Ohio Gov. John Kasich soaked up the majority of delegates with their tie for second place behind Trump.



But there is no hope that Rubio can be the guy to stop Trump in Florida anymore. While Republicans have resisted Cruz, despite his repeated successes, it may be time for the party to admit that Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is quite right: Cruz is the only candidate who has any shot of denying Trump the nomination.



While there was a wintertime flirtation with Trump as the more establishment-friendly and malleable candidate for the GOP, springtime has brought a new realization that Trump could mean not just a general election wipeout, but also generational damage to the partys brand. Cruz has never been the GOPs dream date, but if he can beat Trump it may be enough.



As the latest WSJ/NBC News poll shows, Cruz runs best in a head-to-head matchup with Trump. It may be unthinkable for many country club Republicans that Cruz would be their best choice, but Rubios demise means that it is so.



Just two weeks ago, there were calls for Cruz to fall in behind Rubio for a unity ticket. Now, it seems very clear that unity will work in the other directions and that if the Republicans have a chance to stop Trump from taking over their party it will be Cruz at the top and Rubio as the junior partner.



The sincerity of Rubios attacks on Trump as a con man who is unfit for the presidency will be revealed by whether he not only drops out, but if he enthusiastically campaigns for Cruz in Florida for the next five days.

NEW POLL SHOWS HILLARY LEAD IN THE SUNSHINE STATE

The Hill: Hillary Clinton has healthy leads over Bernie Sanders in Florida and Ohio, where voters will cast ballots in Democratic primaries on March 15, according to a new poll. A Quinnipiac University survey released Wednesday found Clinton crushing Sanders 62 to 32 in the Sunshine State. Here, Clinton is boosted by a huge lead among women voters, who support her 69 percent to 24 percent over Sanders. Clinton also has an 8-point lead among men, and even has the advantage over the democratic socialist among those who describe themselves as very liberal. Young voters have been Sanderss bread and butter, but he and Clinton are tied among those under the age of 44 in Florida, each taking 49 percent.



What went wrong for Hillary in Michigan? - WaPos Philip Bump explains why the Democratic frontrunner lost what was supposed to be a safe state for her Tuesday night: Hillary Clinton lost the Michigan primary on Tuesday night, and the state pried open two critical seams holding her candidacy together...One thing that happened is that Clinton underperformed with black voters in the state. In Mississippi, which Clinton won easily, nearly two-thirds of the vote was black and it went for Clinton 9-to-1. Preliminary exit polling in Michigan suggests that only about a quarter of the electorate in the state was black -- and that Clinton's margin was closer to 2-to-1.



Bernie joins the fight in Ohio -Columbus Dispatch: A national voting rights organization - along with nine 17-year-old plaintiffs - is suing Secretary of State Jon Husted for his refusal to allow 17-year-olds to vote in next weeks presidential primary. Meanwhile, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Democratic candidate for president, filed a separate suit on the matter in federal court. Sanders has strong support among younger voters...In Ohio, 17-year-olds can vote only to nominate candidates, not directly elect them. In the 2015 Election Manual, Husted claimed that since voters in presidential primaries are technically electing delegates, they cannot vote in those elections.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Did things change after Iran's elections? Not really. The mullahs are still in charge,['Alireza Jafarzadeh'],"On February 26th, elections were held for Irans parliament and Assembly of Experts. In the aftermath, we are witnessing some of the same rationalizations and tortured logic that allowed certain Western policymakers to convince themselves three years ago that the Iranian regime was entering a period of moderation and reform. Then as now, the election of Hassan Rouhani as president was seen as a serious moment of moderation in the history of the theocratic, terrorist-supporting state.

It is true that Iran has now entered into an agreement with a handful of Western powers, exchanging modest concessions on the Iranian nuclear program for a lifting of punishing economic sanctions. But this is not sufficient to demonstrate a serious change in the behavior of the Iranian regime. Quite the contrary, it is indicative of the ends to which that regime will go to preserve the existing power structure.

Although the allies of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, still hold the largest share of the parliament and although the Guardian Council purged rival factions commonly referred to as reformists in the West, much of the international media has declared the elections a victory for moderates.

Iranian regime officials went to great lengths to inflate the voter turnout as a sign of the publics endorsing the current system while defying Western infiltration. But the Iranian people never had a choice that would have truly reflected their educated, pro-democratic, secular, and non-belligerent perspective on domestic and world affairs. In reality, the election was a sham, which served to preserve the same theocratic system and the same key players that have ruled Iran for nearly four decades.

This is well illustrated by even a cursory look at some of the key reformist victors in the February elections.

Leading Western officials have overlooked the fact that three years into Rouhanis presidency, the Iranian people experience more suppression, more executions and more arrests. The danger of execution for non-violent offenses, and for participating in anti-government demonstrations, which is considered a political crime labeled as enmity against God, is more prevalent now than in over 20 years.

Over 2,300 people have been executed since Rouhani took office, and hundreds of others have been arrested or harassed by Iranian authorities for engaging in supposedly undesirable cultural expressions, or speaking out on behalf of political prisoners, or simply having connections with the genuine democratic opposition.

Rouhani has not been the only loyal servant of the theocracy throughout his career. The same can be said of all the well-known candidates from the supposedly moderate and reformist faction in the recent elections. They include men like former Chief Prosecutor of the Revolutionary Court Ali Razini and former Prosecutor General and Intelligence Minister Ghorbanali Dorri Najafabadi, both of whom oversaw the executions of political prisoners, the extrajudicial assassinations of dissidents and undesirables, and issued orders for shockingly inhumane punishments like stoning.

Meanwhile, standing side-by-side with current president Hassan Rouhani is former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who has somehow come to be regarded as a leading reformist. This is a man for whom Interpol issued an arrest warrant due to his involvement in the 1994 bombing of the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires, which killed 85 people and wounded 300.

Despite the efforts of some in the West to find them, there are no real signs of reform or changes in behavior over the past three decades. The Iranian people and their organized opposition, who have long rejected the ruling theocracy and called for a secular, democratic and non-nuclear republic in Iran, hold the key to real reform and change, not the regime that suppresses them.

Alireza Jafarzadeh, the deputy director of the Washington office of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, is credited with exposing Iranian nuclear sites in Natanz and Arak in 2002, triggering International Atomic Energy Agency inspections.

The University of Leicester in the U.K. discovered soccer fans have actually been celebrating with so much energy when the Leicester City F.C. Foxes score that it's caused spikes in seismic activity.



The largest of these mini earthquakes was recorded when the Foxes scored a game-winner in the 89th minute of a match against Norwich on Feb. 27.



Around the same time as that goal, a 0.3-magnitude quake registered on the monitoring equipment geology students had set up at a nearby primary school.



A seismologist with the British Geological Survey told the BBC, ""It wasn't just a case of cheering or clapping, it was 30,000 people standing up at the same time  an awful amount of energy.""



A smaller earthquake, about 0.1 in magnitude, registered when the Foxes scored a goal in the first half against West Bromwich Albion on March 1.

This occurrence isn't unique to U.K. soccer.



Seattle Seahawks fans have generated several small-scale quakes throughout the years, none more famous than the ""Beast Quake"" running back Marshawn Lynch started in the 2011 playoffs.



The University of Leicester students will continue to monitor the rest of the Foxes' season for any more seismic activity.



They're betting player Jamie Vardy will generate the highest magnitude quake after he scores.

Alex Killorn scored with 42.5 seconds left on the clock in overtime as the Lightning got their team-record ninth straight win by beating the Carolina Hurricanes 4-3 on Saturday night.

""Anytime when hockey is turned up at this time of year, everybody is scrambling to make the playoffs, it's a testament to those guys,"" Tampa Bay coach Jon Cooper said.

The Lightning are not the only NHL team on a roll.

Anaheim won its 11th straight earlier Saturday when David Perron scored the go-ahead power-play goal in the second period of a 3-2 victory over Los Angeles.

""Stealing our thunder a little bit,"" Cooper said with smile.

Killorn skated around a Carolina defender and through the slot before beating Hurricanes goalie Eddie Lack.

""I was trying to figure out how to make a play,"" Killorn said. ""Just ended up skating up the ice.""

Ondrej Palat had two goals for the Lightning, who broke the old mark of eight wins in a row from 2004 when Tampa Bay won its lone Stanley Cup. Tyler Johnson had the other Tampa Bay goal, tying the score at 3-3 with 6:18 remaining in regulation.

Carolina got goals from Victor Rask, Jordan Staal and Jeff Skinner.

""They're quicker than we are,"" Hurricanes coach Bill Peters said. ""Their pace, their speed. Their quickness puts you in trouble.""

Both teams had several quality scoring chances during overtime including Palat, who skated down the slot and his hat trick bid stopped by Lack.

""In overtime anything can happen,"" Tampa Bay goalie Ben Bishop said. ""The guys were flying there. You had a feeling something good was going to happen.""

After Staal scored during a power play at 3:09 of the third when Elias Lindholm's shot hit his leg and then went off Tampa Bay defenseman Anton Stralman, Skinner gave Carolina a 3-2 advantage on the rebound at 10:18.

Skinner's goal came less than a minute after Riley Nash completed serving a 4-minute penalty for high-sticking Palat.

Palat put Tampa Bay up 2-1 after skating from behind the net to the top of the right circle and scoring off the post with 4:19 remaining in the second.

About a minute after Bishop made a glove save on Skinner's right-circle shot, Rask tied it at 1 with 6:36 left in the second when his shot from the slot deflected off the goalie.

Shortly after Tampa Bay defenseman Victor Hedman's hooking penalty expired, Palat opened the scoring with 3:17 left in the first. The left wing picked up the puck deep in the defensive zone and later made a move around defenseman Ron Hainsey before beating Lack from the low right-circle.

NOTES: Bishop improved to 7-1-0 against Carolina. ... Carolina LW Phillip Di Giuseppe had two assists for his first points in 10 games. ... The Lightning have won 12 of the last 14 games between the teams. ... Tampa Bay is 29-5-0 when scoring first. ... Lack is 0-3-1 against Tampa Bay. ... Skinner also had an assist and a game-high six shots on goal. ... Carolina D Brett Pesce was minus-3.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Rubio hopes core of Latino voters can help him win crucial Florida primary,"[""Andrew O'reilly""]","Marco Rubio told a crowd of supporters gathered in in Ponte Vedra, Florida on Tuesday night that he needed their help.

The full results from the nights four Republican primaries had not yet trickled in, but Rubio knew the results werent in his favor. And if the Florida senator was going to have any sliver of hope in winning the GOP nod he would need to pull off a surprise in his home state.

Rubio finished fourth-place in both Michigan and Mississippi, which only added to an ever widening delegate gap between him and front-runner Donald Trump.

I need your help, Rubio said, according the Politico. I believe with all my heart that the winner of the Florida primary next Tuesday will be the nominee of the Republican Party.

Analysts and observers say that one of Rubios main weaknesses in this campaign season is his lack of base support.

The Florida lawmaker has been touted as the most agreeable candidate for Republican voters and the best candidate to go head-to-head with prospective Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But as this 2016 presidential race has shown, core support  like Ted Cruz has with evangelical voters and Donald Trump has with disenfranchised working-class voters  has helped Rubios rivals carry most of the states.

Who has the biggest possibility of beating Hillary Clinton, all the strategists say that Marco has the best shot, Evelyn Perez-Verdia, an analyst with Political Pasion, told Fox News Latino. But at the end of the day hes going against a movement like we havent seen in the U.S. in Donald Trump.

Rubio, as the establishment candidate, said that instead of winning over a core support group, the candidate has instead cast a broad net in trying to win over everyone. To successfully do this a candidate must have a great deal of political dexterity.

Not only do you have to stay on message, you have to sustain multiple messages to multiple audiences, Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight wrote. It helps to have surrogates vouching for you to different constituencies, something Rubio didnt have a lot of until recently. And it helps to have enough media exposure to avoid being typecast in one role, something Rubio hasnt had all that much of in Trumps shadow.

There are others, however, who say that Rubio may have more of a base support than people claim  at least in the Sunshine State.

He has a big following from the conservative Cuban population because he was partially groomed by them, Perez-Verdia told FNL about Rubio. There are also some pockets that he is reaching out to that Ted Cruz and Donald Trump have not.

Perez-Verdia added that Rubio has made inroads with Floridas growing Colombian population thanks to his wifes roots and also with Venezuelan-Americans after speaking out harshly against the leftist government of President Nicolas Maduro.

One of Rubios two primary victories came in Puerto Rico. And Florida has seen its Puerto Rican population skyrocket in recent years as the islands economic woes continue.

Its still a longshot for Rubio  the latest Real Clear Politics average of polls from Florida have Trump holding an almost 17 point lead over his rival  but a late surge of campaigning and the support of Latinos, especially those disenfranchised with Trumps anti-immigrant rhetoric, could shift the state to Rubio.

You are given an incredible task a week from now, and I need your help, Rubio told his supporters. Go and vote now so you can spend the next six days finding other people to vote for me.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Hulk Hogan trial: Gawker editor draws line at sex-tape of a 4-year-old,[],"Jurors in Hulk Hogans sex video trial on Wednesday heard a videotaped deposition of Gawkers former editor in chief  shockingly saying hed draw the line at posting a sex tape of a celebrity who is under 4 years old.

A.J. Daulerio, 41, was sitting ramrod-straight in the Florida courtroom during the incredibly awkward moment when he was asked by Hulk Hogans lawyer, Can you imagine a situation where a celebrity sex tape would not be newsworthy?

Daulerio answered flatly, If they were a child.

Under what age? he was asked.

Four, he said.

More on this... Hulk Hogan testifies in lawsuit against Gawker over sex tape

No 4-year-old sex tapes, OK, the attorney said.

Daulerio, who looked bored throughout the grilling, wiping his eyes and resting his hand on his chin, also claimed he would have no problem if his own hypothetical sex tape were published.

It wouldnt upset you in any way to have your sexual encounters appear on the Internet? he was asked.

I somewhat expect that to happen at some point, Daulerio said.

Jurors seemed distressed by Daulerios cavalier attitude about posting the sex tape.

One male juror squinted, pursed his lips and leaned back in his chair, while a female juror seated next to him kept her arms crossed, then jotted down notes.

A third woman looked down during parts of the testimony.

Daulerio said he first heard about the Hogan sex video when it was a story on TMZ.

He said he first watched the video when he returned from a vacation on the West Coast.

I watched it and watched it one or two times and then, then decided whether or not we are going to publish some of the contents of it, and was discussing how we could possibly share some of the contents of it, and was discussing how we could possibly share some of the footage on Gawker.com, he said.

He said he turned the tape over to his video editor and selected various spots of the tape that I considered both newsworthy in the context of our story and had her twiddle it down to whatever the time frame was, I believe it was close to two minutes of footage.

He said he wanted to verify that Hogan and Heather Clem  then-wife of Hogans former best pal Bubba the Love Sponge Clem  were actually having sex, so I believe we did small snippets of those two having intercourse.

Daulerio went on to say that he found the video very amusing and newsworthy  and would be somewhat popular on the site.

Did you give any consideration prior to Oct. 4, 2012, as to whether publishing the Hulk Hogan sex tape would distress Hulk Hogan? the lawyer asked.

No, he answered.

You didnt care, really, did you? the lawyer asked.

No, he said again.

Had you known that Hulk Hogan would be emotionally distressed by this publication, you would have still published it, correct? he was asked.

Sure, yes, Daulerio said.

Former pro wrestler Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, is suing Gawker Media for $100 million for posting an edited version of the sex video.

Gawker is defending the publication by arguing that Hogan had talked openly about his sex life before, including on Howard Sterns radio show.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Kids who skip lunch are missing out on essential nutrients,[],"Reuters Health - Children who skip lunch may not be getting enough vitamins and minerals from the rest of their meals and snacks, a study suggests.

Researchers examined nutrition information for almost 4,800 school-age kids and found that about 7 to 20 percent skipped lunch at least once a week.

""Overall, the lunch meal is very important for helping children meet their nutrient needs, especially for fat-soluble vitamins A and D, minerals like calcium, phosphorus and magnesium that are important for healthy bones, and dietary fiber,"" study coauthor Alison Eldridge of the Nestle Research Center in Lausanne, Switzerland, told Reuters Health in an email.

Previous studies have focused on nutrient intake and breakfast skipping or snacking, but no one had looked at what happens when kids miss lunch.

Eldridge and her colleagues wanted to fill that gap, so they examined information from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys 2009-2010 and 2011-2012.

On any given day, about 7 percent of 4- to 8-year-olds, 16 percent of 9- to 13-year-olds, and 17 percent of 14- to 18-year-olds skipped their lunches, the research team reported in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.

The youngest kids were more likely to skip lunch on the weekends, and girls ages 9 to 18 were more likely to skip lunch during the week.

Almost a quarter of black and Hispanic teens skipped lunch, and about 30 percent of black children ages 9 to 18 missed lunch on the weekends.

Kids who missed lunches tended to be deficient in vitamins A, D, E, and K, along with several essential minerals.

But while children who missed lunch also consumed less protein, fiber, and total fats, their total intakes of sugar and solid fats was no different than in kids who ate lunch.

""We were surprised at the number of children and adolescents skipping lunch, especially on the weekends,"" Eldridge said. ""We were also surprised that the children and adolescents who skipped lunch ate similar amounts of 'empty' calories, compared to those who ate lunch.""

Eldridge said childhood is an important time for building habits that could impact life-long health.

""Parents have an important role in modeling good eating behaviors, by offering a variety of nutrient-dense foods to their children, and by encouraging children to eat regular meals,"" Eldridge said.

Sandra Arevalo, Director of Nutrition and Community Outreach at Community Pediatrics Program of Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical System in New York, said lunch also helps regulate appetite and metabolism.

""Children who don't eat lunch at school and spend long hours with an empty stomach tend to snack more when they return home and eat larger dinners,"" said Arevalo, who wasn't involved in the study. ""Many children don't eat breakfast either, making their first meal at home after returning from school.""

Arevalo said by email that one or two meals per day aren't enough to provide all the nutrients a child needs to grow strong and healthy.

""Start by making sure that your child always eats something before going to school,"" Arevalo said. ""Quick and nutrient rich foods to eat in the morning include whole grain cereals with low fat milk, a yogurt parfait, a cereal bar with a cup of low-fat milk, a fruit and/or vegetables smoothie, egg, cheese or turkey sandwich or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich on whole wheat bread.""

Arevalo also suggests packing healthy snacks such as yogurt, sandwiches, fruits, or fresh vegetables and dip, for days when kids might not like the school lunches.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-02-24 00:00:00,Rare Charles Darwin letter will be sold at auction,['Michael Casey'],"A rare handwritten letter by famed naturalist Charles Darwin to a British marine biologist will be auctioned off Thursday, in which he details plans to release a corrected version of the book The Origin of Species.

In the letter, Darwin also expresses excitement about the work of the marine biologist George Charles Wallich on brittle starfish but also wonders about his findings on basaltic pebbles. He also thanks Wallich for sending his book Notes on the Presence of Animal at Vast Depth in the Sea and asks about Wallichs observations regarding shell deposits, which are important for me in relation to some few passages in my Book.

This signed letter concerning deep ocean discoveries shows Darwin's interest in biological life and geology at the ocean bottom and his meticulous efforts at clarifying the findings of Wallich, Nate Sanders, owner of Nate D. Sanders Auctions, said in a statement. Darwin's attention to details demonstrates why he was such a superb naturalist.""

It is the latest of several Darwin letters to be auctioned off. In September, a Darwin letter in which he stated he did not believe in God was sold for $197,000 at Bonhams New York. That was three times the previous record of $59,142 for a four-page letter that Darwin had penned to his niece.

A month later, Bonhams sold a letter from Darwin on the sex life of barnacles for $25,000.

This letter was written on Dec. 12, 1860, about a year after the publication of The Origin of Species. The book is considered the foundation of evolutionary biology and introduced the idea that species evolved over generations through the process of natural selection.

In the letter, Darwin asked Wallich about observations including the foraminifer [protozoa with shells] deposit was sometimes or often thin; and this is the point on which I am anxious for information  It bears on the decay of the exuviae [exoskeleton remains] of organisms at the bottom of the sea.

But he wasnt only complimentary, proclaiming Wallich was rather bold in inferring that the basaltic pebbles were rounded at such great depths? Are you sure they were not dropped by icebergs either recently or at the end of the glacial period?

Bidding on the letter will start at $69,500 and will be done online.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,The most popular food in French restaurants is the hamburger,[],"Think French food is all about fancy foie gras served with difficult-to-pronounce ingredients?

It turns out the people of France have pretty similar tastes to American diners.

According to a new study, three quarters of restaurants in France have a hamburger on their menu and 80 percent say the burger is the top selling dish.

""Burger mania (in France) is unstoppable, Bernard Boutboul, director of Gira Conseil, the food consultant firm behind the study, told The Telegraph.

In the U.S. sales of burgers have been steadily climbing, boosted by the proliferation of higher-end chains like Shake Shack and Five Guys. Burger chain revenue topped $70 billion in 2013.

In France last year, people ate 1.19 billion burgersthats roughly 16 burgers per person annually, accounting for an 11 percent rise in just a year. The burger has become so popular that it may replace the French lunchtime staple jambon beurre"" (ham and butter baguette). Sales of the classic sandwich fell to 1.23 billion in 2015.

""If it goes on like this, then one can assume that within two years sales of the jambon-beurre and burger will be neck and neck, said Boutboul.

Its not just higher end restaurants that are reaping the benefits of Frances burger obsession. The country is McDonalds biggest market outside of the U.S. and was one of the few nations in the world where the chain recorded a rise in revenue last year. Boutboul says the quick-serve restaurants McDonalds, Burger King and the French chain Quick account for about a third of the burgers sold in the country.

The burger, says Boutboul has gone ""from basic fast food to Michelin-starred restaurants...More than a fad, it has become a way of life ... the dish is no longer out of place in any surrounding or decor.""

U.S. burger joints are responding to the Frances demand. Five Guys is set to open its first Parisian location in a few weeks.

But the French still have a long way to go when it comes to beating American burger consumption.

In 2014, American restaurants sold over 9 billion burgers meaning the average American chowed down on more than 28 burgers that year.",[]

Prosecutors say Tairod Pugh, 48, went to Turkey last year hoping to make his way to Syria to join ISIS.

Defense lawyers say the Neptune, New Jersey man didn't intend to find the terror group a month after he lost his job as an aviation mechanic. But prosecutors say Pugh was preparing to reject the country he had served in the Air Force from 1986 to 1990.

Pugh appeared calm while the verdict was read in the Brooklyn, N.Y. courtroom. He never took the stand during trial testimony.

He faces up to 35 years in prison on the charges of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and obstruction of justice.

Last week, an undercover FBI agent posing as an Islamic State sympathizer testified that he was wearing traditional Muslim religious clothing when he sat down next to Pugh at Kennedy Airport last year, in an area where people waited to be cleared to enter the United States after a trip abroad. He said Pugh told him he had been sent back to the U.S. from Egypt.

""On more than one occasion, he said he expected to be arrested,"" the Los Angeles-based agent said, recalling that Pugh seemed nervous whenever a law enforcement person passed by.

The agent testified that Pugh warmed up to him after seeing an Islamic State flag on his Facebook page. The agent said Pugh told him that if he went to Turkey, he should not look pious.

""He said: 'Shave the beard. Wear the pants.' He said the object is to blend in,"" the agent recalled.

At one point, the agent said, Pugh told him: ""Allah willing, the next time I travel as a tourist to the area, I'll wear a Yankees baseball cap.""

On cross examination, defense lawyer Eric Creizman established that his client never told the agent he had any contact with the Islamic State or any plans to go to Syria. Creizman also had the agent acknowledge that Pugh never said he wanted to wage jihad or become a martyr.

A judge set Pugh's sentencing for September.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Yellowstone bison sent to slaughter as park trims herd,[],"Yellowstone National Park started shipping many of its famous wild bison to slaughter Wednesday to drive down the size of the park's herds and respond to concerns by the livestock industry over a disease carried by the animals.

Thirty animals have been shipped to slaughterhouses, and officials plan to send an additional 120 in the next few days. The bison were weighed and tested for disease for research purposes, and the remaining animals were crowded into holding pens to await shipment.

The park's actions are driven by an agreement in 2000 with Montana officials that requires it to control its bison herds. The meat will be distributed to American Indian tribes that traditionally subsisted on bison.

""Nobody here wants to be doing this,"" park spokeswoman Jody Lyle said after the bison were prodded into trailers for shipment. ""It's time for a change.""

About 150 of the animals have been captured this winter trying to migrate out of the park in search of food at lower elevations in Montana. Ranchers worry about bison infected with brucellosis, a disease that can cause cattle to abort their young.

There have been no recorded bison-to-cattle transmissions of brucellosis, and critics say the slaughters are unnecessary. Captured bison that test negative for it are not spared.

""This is not OK. It's really that simple,"" said Stephany Seay with the Buffalo Field Campaign, a bison advocacy group.

Rick Lamplugh said he moved last May from Oregon to the small town of Gardiner, at the northern entrance to the park, in large part for the wildlife viewing opportunities. The park and state agencies need rethink their policies on bison so they can be ""treated like any other wildlife,"" he said.

Tens of millions of bison, also known as buffalo, once roamed North America. Commercial hunting drove the species to near-extinction in the late 1800s before conservationists  including former President Theodore Roosevelt  intervened when only dozens were left.

Yellowstone is home to one of the few remaining wild populations. Millions of tourists visit the park each year to see the animals, a top attraction at the nation's first national park. The animals also are the symbol of the National Park Service.

Since the 1980s, worry over brucellosis has prompted the killing of about 8,200 park bison, most of them sent to slaughter. In recent years, state, federal and tribal agencies have tried to emphasize public hunts that occur just outside the park's boundaries.

Hunters so far this winter have killed more than 400 of the animals, said Andrea Jones with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. That's the most since 1989. The vast majority were shot by members of American Indian tribes that have treaty hunting rights in the Yellowstone region.

Detracting from the hunt's success has been an unprecedented number of animals that were merely wounded and retreated to the park after being shot.

Up to 50 wounded bison were killed by state and federal wildlife agents, Jones said.

The park had 4,900 bison at last count, well above the 3,000 dictated under the agreement. Park officials set a goal this year of removing 600 to 900 of the animals. More shipments to slaughter are possible in coming weeks if large groups of bison move into Montana, although a mild winter has reduced this year's migration compared with previous years.

During the past decade, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and his predecessor moved to allow bison into areas adjacent to the park. Yellowstone administrators have supported those efforts, but they say they are bound under the 2000 agreement to keep the bison herds in check.

Alternatives  such as transferring some Yellowstone bison to lands outside the park  are under consideration but unlikely to take effect soon. Park workers are holding back from slaughter about two dozen bison calves for potential future placement elsewhere if the opportunity arises, park spokeswoman Amy Bartlett said.

If that doesn't happen, the animals will be slaughtered, she said.",[]

foxnews.com,2015-10-24 00:00:00,Why you should wrap your keys in aluminum foil,[],"Your car is always listening. Not for your voice, like the Amazon Echo or Siri, but for an electronic signal, such as the coded ""unlock"" signal from your electronic key fob. If it's a newer car model, you might not have to press any buttons; just approach your car and the doors will unlock automatically. In some cars, the engine will even turn on.

Wirelessly unlocking your car is convenient, but it comes at a price. Criminals can easily intercept the key fob's signal and open your car without setting off any alarms. If you have a true keyless car model, they might be able to just drive away. Let's look at how criminals pull this off and what you can do to keep your car safe.

How your car's security system works

As you've probably noticed, you can't just open your car with any old radio signal. You need your specific key fob to do the job, and there's a reason.

A key fob uses a computer chip to create a unique code that it sends to your car's security system. The car also has a chip that uses the same algorithm to generate codes. If the codes match up, the car opens. There's a bit more to it, but those are the basics.

How criminals attack #1

Since each key fob/car security pair is unique, and each one can create billions of codes, hackers shouldnt stand a chance. But it turns out that a popular system from Megamos Crypto isn't as secure everyone thought.

Researchers at Radboud University in the Netherlands and the University of Birmingham found that by intercepting the wireless signal just twice, they could narrow down the possible combinations from billions to just 200,000. After that, a computer can figure out the code in just half an hour and unlock the car.

In a real-world application, a thief could sit on a street and gather wireless signals as car owners enter and exit their vehicles. Then overnight they could steal a number of cars. Click here to find out if your car is at risk from this kind of attack.

Still, it takes a skilled car thief or hacker to carry out this kind of attack, so the odds of it happening to you are slim. But thanks to always-on key fobs, there's another risk that's much more likely to happen.

How criminals attack #2

Always-on key fobs present a serious weakness in your car's security. As long as your keys are in range, anyone can open the car and the system will think it's you. That's why newer car models won't unlock until the key fob is within a foot of them.

But for less than $100, criminals can get an amplifier that detects key fob signals from up to 300 feet away and then transmits them to your car. In other words, your keys could be in your house, and criminals could walk up to your car and open it. This isn't just a theory; it's actually happening.

Steps to stop car thieves

Fortunately, there are some simple steps you can take to keep hackers from stealing your signal. You can buy a signal-blocking pouch that can hold your keys, like the Hack-Blocking Card Pouch I sell in the Komando Shop.

If you dont want to spend any money, you can stick your key fob into the refrigerator or freezer. The multiple layers of metal will block your key fob's signal. Just check with the fob's manufacturer to make sure that freezing your key fob won't damage it.

If you're not hot on freezing your key fob, you can do the same thing with your microwave oven. (Hint: Don't turn it on.) Stick your key fob in there, and criminals won't be able to pick up its signal. Like any seasoned criminal, they'll just move onto an easier target.

Since your key fob's signal is blocked by metal, you can also wrap it up in aluminum foil. While that's the easiest solution, it can also leak the signal if you don't do it right. Plus, you might need to stock up on foil. You can also make a foil-lined box to put your keys in, if you're in a crafting mood.

You should also be aware that this kind of signal stealing isn't a problem just for car key fobs. Newer passports and other I.D. cards contain radio frequency identification chips that enable criminals to use a high-powered RFID reader to steal your information from a distance. You don't need aluminum foil, however. Explore the line of stylish RFID-blocking wallets, purses and passport cases I sell in the Komando Shop.

foxnews.com,2016-03-03 00:00:00,FBI investigating if Clinton aides shared passwords to access classified info,"['Pamela K', 'Catherine Herridge']","EXCLUSIVE: The FBI is investigating whether computer passwords were shared among Hillary Clinton's close aides to determine how sensitive intelligence ""jumped the gap"" between the classified systems and Clinton's unsecured personal server, according to an intelligence source familiar with the probe.

The source emphasized to Fox News that if [Clinton] was allowing other people to use her passwords, that is a big problem. The Foreign Service Officers Manual prohibits the sharing of passwords.

Such passwords are required to access each State Department network. This includes the network for highly classified intelligence -- known as SCI or Sensitive Compartmented Information -- and the unclassified system, known as SBU or Sensitive But Unclassified, according to former State Department employees.

Fox News was told there are several potential scenarios for how classified information got onto Clintons server:

Reading intelligence reports or briefings, and then summarizing the findings in emails sent on Clinton's unsecured personal server.

Accessing the classified intelligence computer network, and then lifting sections by typing them verbatim into a device such as an iPad or BlackBerry.

Taking pictures of a computer screen to capture the intelligence.

Using a thumb drive or disk to physically move the intelligence, but this would require access to a data center. Its unclear whether Clintons former IT specialist Bryan Pagliano, who as first reported by The Washington Post has reached an immunity deal with the Justice Department, or others had sufficient administrator privileges to physically transfer data.

Most of these scenarios would require a password. And all of these practices would be strictly prohibited under non-disclosure agreements signed by Clinton and others, and federal law.

It remains unclear who had access to which computers and devices used by Clinton while she was secretary of state and where exactly they were located at the time of the email correspondence. Clinton signed her NDA agreement on Jan. 22, 2009 shortly before she was sworn in as secretary of state.

The intelligence source said the ongoing FBI investigation is progressing in ""fits and starts"" but bureau agents have refined a list of individuals who will be questioned about their direct handling of the emails, with a focus on how classified information jumped the gap between classified systems and briefings to Clinton's unsecured personal email account used for government business.

Fox News was told the agents involved are not political appointees but top notch agents with decades of experience.

A separate source said the list of individuals is relatively small -- about a dozen, among them Clinton aide Jake Sullivan, who was described as ""pivotal"" because he forwarded so many emails to Clinton. His exchanges, now deemed to contain highly classified information, included one email which referred to human spying, or ""HCS-O,"" and included former Clinton aide Huma Abedin.

As Fox News first reported last year, two emails -- one sent by Abedin that included classified information about the 2011 movement of Libyan troops during the revolution, and a second sent by Sullivan that contained law enforcement information about the FBI investigation in the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack  kick-started the FBI probe.

Testifying to Congress Tuesday about encryption, FBI Director James Comey also was asked about the Clinton investigation. He responded that he is very close personally to the case to ensure that we have the resources we need including people and technology and that it's done the way the FBI tries to do all of its work: independently, competently and promptly. That's our goal and I'm confident it's being done that way.""

Earlier this week when she was asked if Clinton has been interviewed by the FBI, Attorney General Loretta Lynch insisted to Fox News Bret Baier that no one outside of DOJ has been briefed on this or any other case. Thats not our policy and it has not happened in this matter.

Fox News also has learned the State Department cannot touch the security clearance of top aides connected to the case without contacting the FBI, because agents plan to directly question individuals about their handling of the emails containing classified information, and they will need active clearances to be questioned.

While it is standard practice to suspend a security clearance pending the outcome of an investigation, Fox News reported Monday that Clintons chief of staff at State, Cheryl Mills, who is also an attorney, maintains her top secret clearance. Mills was involved in the decisions as to which emails to keep and which to delete from the server.

Santos said at a public event Wednesday he would not sign a bad agreement just to wrap things up by a certain date. It was his first public statement acknowledging that the two sides may miss the March 23 deadline they agreed to last year.

Santos says if the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia have not come up with an acceptable deal, they will simply set a new deadline.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, whose researchers are expected to present their findings Friday at a meeting on coral reefs, concluded that the global coral bleaching event that started in 2014 in the western Pacific Ocean could extend well into 2017.

Related: NOAA: Latest El Nino is now tied for strongest ever

We are currently experiencing the longest global coral bleaching event ever observed, Mark Eakin, NOAAs Coral Reef Watch coordinator, said in a statement. We may be looking at a 2- to 212-year-long event. Some areas have already seen bleaching two years in a row.

Coral bleaching happens when corals are stressed by conditions such as high water temperatures brought on by El Nino and global warming, prompting the corals to expel algae that live in their tissues. Without the algae, corals lose a significant source of food and are more vulnerable to disease.

The worst bleaching events have often coincided with El Nino events  created when the equatorial waters of the Pacific Ocean warm significantly. The first widespread mass bleaching occurred during the 1982-83 El Nino, while a record El Nino in 1997-98, caused the first global bleaching event. A second global bleaching event occurred in 2010, during a less powerful El Nino.

NOAA forecasters in January concluded the current El Nino is now as strong as the one in 1997-98. It began in March 2015 and the World Meteorological Organization announced this week that it had peaked and would weaken in the comings months before fading away in the second quarter.

Along with coral bleaching, this El Nino has been blamed on a more active cyclone season in the Western North Pacific and Eastern North Pacific basins, drought in Central America as well changing weather across North America  including forecasts of above-average precipitation across the southern tier of the United States and above-average temperatures in the North and West, the WMO said.

According to Eakin, the record-long bleaching may make it impossible for corals in some parts of the world to recover before they are hit again.

NOAA coral scientists point out that reefs that bleached in 2015 in the Caribbean and Florida Keys have just started to recover, but may start bleaching all over again as early as July. Eakin also notes that in the Pacific, corals in Fijis near shore waters are bleaching with lots of dead coral for the second consecutive year, and could be worse than last year.

Related: Worst of this El Nino expected in coming months

The 1998 bleaching event may offer a guide of what to expect. Severe bleaching in Southeast Asia followed by 12 years of recovery allowed some of the more rapid growing, branching corals to grow back. However, the slower growing corals that build the backbone of reefs did not recover. In 2010, the same area was hit again, killing off newly grown branching corals and many of the surviving massive corals.

The 2010 Southeast Asia event was only six years ago, said Eakin. We're seeing global bleaching again now. Research shows that the frequency of mass bleaching events is increasing because of global warming. The corals are being hit again and again.

The loss of reefs to bleaching can have dire economic and environmental consequences. Reefs are some of the world's most important ecosystems, supporting more species than any other marine environment, including 4,000 fish species. About 500 million people also depend on the reefs for food and protection, with reefs contributing $29.8 billion to the world economies each year, NOAA said.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Ukrainian pilot gives Russian court the middle finger in trial she calls a farce,[],"Defiant in her closing statement Wednesday to a Russian court, Ukrainian pilot Nadezhda Savchenko brandished her middle finger, burst into the Ukrainian national anthem and declared her trial in the death of two Russian journalists to be ""the farce of Kremlin puppets.""

Savchenko's case has sparked anger at home and sharp criticism from the West since her detention under murky circumstances in 2014.

She was fighting with a volunteer brigade against Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Russia claims she was acting as a spotter and called in the coordinates for a mortar attack that killed two Russian journalists and several other civilians.

Savchenko denies the allegation, and the Ukrainian government says she was abducted by Russia and should be treated as a prisoner of war.

The judge said he would begin reading the verdict on March 21, a procedure expected to take two days. Her lawyers say that conviction is a foregone conclusion; the only question is if the court will impose the 23 years in prison sought by prosecutors.

In protest of repeated delays in court proceedings, Savchenko last week announced a hunger strike. In court on Wednesday, she appeared pale, clad in a T-shirt displaying the trident that is Ukraine's national emblem.

""In Russia, there are no courts and no investigations. Here there is only the farce of Kremlin puppets"" Savchenko told the court. ""If you want to show your strength, go ahead. But remember, we are playing with my life. The stakes are high and I have nothing to lose.""

International attention to the case included sharp criticism from U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who on Tuesday called for her immediate release and said her health is deteriorating because of the hunger strike.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffan Seibert, also called for her release and said that Savchenko was subject to ""questionable interrogation methods and breaches of international standards.""

A group of European Parliament lawmakers has pushed for the EU to levy more sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and other Russian lawmakers, in part because of the handling of the Savchenko case. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Ukrainian counterpart Pavlo Klimkin on Wednesday spoke about Ukraine's demand that Ukrainian doctors be able to visit Savchenko. A Foreign Ministry statement said Lavrov rejected the appeal because of her ""insulting"" statement to the court.

Until the next court appearance, Savchenko won't be allowed to have visitations with her family, Ukrainian counsels or Ukrainian doctors, according to Polozov.

About 2,000 Ukrainians rallied in central Kiev on Sunday to demand that Russia release Savchenko, and the officer's ongoing imprisonment has sparked outrage in the international community as well.

Savchenko lawyer Mark Feygin has expressed hope that the Kremlin could allow her to serve out her sentence in Ukraine, which is legal under Russian law.

""It is the only way, not just to stop (her) hunger strike, but also to finish the case with dignity,"" Feygin told journalists on Wednesday.

Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters on Wednesday that negotiation on any decision concerning Savchenko's future won't happen-- in theory or practice-- until the verdict is pronounced.

Such an arrangement could also depend on the results of the trial in Ukraine of two Russians who were captured in eastern Ukraine and charged with being Russian soldiers. However, that trial on Wednesday was postponed for a week because the lawyer for one of the men didn't appear, and a lawyer for the other said he had not been reachable by telephone for two days.",[]

To be sure, nobody expects Trump or any GOP presidential candidate to win the majority of the black vote, which has been with Democrats since the mid-1930s. Clinton has every reason to believe most black voters sticking with her in the primary against Bernie Sanders would do so in a general election as well.

However, analysts suggest that to consider the black vote a monolith for Clinton in November, should she win the nomination, would be a mistake. The Trump jobs message that has attracted so many disaffected white, blue-collar workers could resonate with black voters equally frustrated by chronic unemployment and unfulfilled promises of change  and Trumps accelerating march toward the GOP nomination has proven his knack for bringing in voters who might not normally pick a Republican.

If anything, he knows the economy, Luz Nelson, a beautician and black South Carolina voter, said days before the front-running Clinton won the state Democratic primary with more than 80 percent of the black vote.

Im a New Yorker, too, Nelson continued. I know where hes coming from. Nobody controls Donald Trump.

If he wants to put any significant portion of the black vote in play, Trump would have to do better than past GOP nominees -- if he indeed is his partys standard-bearer come November.

Then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney got just 6 percent in 2012. John McCain got even less, 4 percent, in 2008 against Barack Obama, who became the countrys first black president. Republican President Gerald Ford won the highest percentage of the black vote in modern history -- 16 percent -- but still lost to Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter.

Influential black political commentator Tavis Smiley recently cautioned Democrats that Trumps appeal could cross not only party but racial lines.

If Donald Trump is indeed the Republican nominee, it might be a miscalculation for Democrats to take for granted that black voters are a lock for their nominee, even with [Bill Clinton] and Barack Obama campaigning for her, Smiley wrote in a USA Today op-ed.

There is no reason to believe that if he is his partys nominee, Donald Trump wouldnt make a serious play for black voters. Who knows how many he might skim? In a close election, it might not take much.

Clinton has since South Carolina in early February continued winning the black vote in large numbers across the South. She did so again in the Mississippi primary Tuesday night, though Sanders upset victory in Michigan all but eclipsed that success.

Meanwhile, she has secured a long list of influential African-American endorsements, from actor Morgan Freeman to civil rights icon Georgia Democratic Rep. John Lewis, while the front-running Trump appears to be struggling to make grassroots connections.

Online videos appear to show Black Lives Matters activists protesting and disrupting recent rallies, as Trump can be heard in the background of one event telling security to throw them out.

And critics say he failed during a recent national TV appearance to unequivocally disavow support from former Klu Klux Klan leader David Duke  though Trump has since disavowed it, and downplayed the controversy.

Democratic and Republican strategists seem to agree, though, that the billionaire businessman Trump  charisma, bravado and all  has at least captured the interest and curiosity of black voters.

Up until the KKK thing, he had been doing pretty well, Douglas Smith, a Democratic strategist and partner at Kent Strategies, said Tuesday. He oozes this appearance that everybody can fly in a gold jet and have a mansion. I think its his signature charisma.

Smith nevertheless suspects Trump will ultimately come up short because he doesnt have the deep well of support with the black community like Clinton has -- built over the course of roughly 40 years of public service.

And he says Trump lacks the ground game and the kind of party support that would coalesce around Clinton or Sanders.

You just cant add water, Smith said.

Republican strategist Rob Burgess thinks some of Trumps appeal is indeed in policy, specifically his health care proposals.

I will not let people die on the streets for lack of health care, he roared in a debate last month.

However, Burgess thinks other black voters believe Trump will indeed boost the economy for American workers and added, He can sway some black voters ... due to his charisma.

The Trump campaign declined to comment on efforts to connect with black voters.

However, the campaign has occasionally used two black women  the Stump for Trump Girls -- as a warmup act on the trail and whose performances have become an Internet sensation.

If we continue to vote left, we are going to get left, the duo said at Trumps military veterans fundraiser last month in Iowa. And when we look at Donald J. Trump, he has us in mind. He wants a secure boarder. He wants to bring jobs back. He wants to make sure our veterans are taken care of. ... And thats why baby we are going to stump for Donald J. Trump.

The Rev. Issac Holt, senior pastor at the Royal Missionary Baptist Church, in North Charleston, S.C.  who was visited by both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns  thinks the wild card for Trump or any other GOP nominee is the energy they are bringing to the race.

Fox News correspondent Jesse Watters asked attendees at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) if they thought Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump was a conservative. Watters spoke to speakers and attendees, alike, with mixed responses.

Watters: What is the definition of a true conservative?

Somebody who has Reagan values, believes in small government...

It means limited government. It means lower taxes. It means an adherence to the rule of law.

The governments job is to protect those rights. Not to give us free stuff. Not to give bank bailouts. Not to do any of the stuff Trump loves, Glenn Beck said.

Watters: Is Donald Trump a true conservative?

I believe he is a true conservative. Hes strong on national security, said Fox News contributor and actress Stacey Dash.

Oh, absolutely not.

Watters: Why not?

The man has been paying money to everybody  left and right  for his whole history.

Hes more like Hillary Clinton than a conservative. Sorry.

Its ABC right now, which is Anybody But Clinton. So if he winds up taking the nod, then we need to rally behind him.

In my opinion if hes involved, hes a true conservative. If hes not, then his ardent supporters are going to be disappointed, said radio talk show host, David Webb.

Absolutely not. Hes demonstrated that hes a tyrant.

Watters: Hes a tyrant at the debates, but hes won every debate, right?

Not necessarily.

Watters: Do you think Trumps ego can be stroked?

The man is all about ego. Hes an ego maniac.

I support Donald Trump. I think hes going to change the world, and I think the people of America are fed up with our federal government, said former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer.

Hes getting a lot of evangelical support. Hes changed the dynamic.

Watters: What do you think about Bill OReilly, is he a conservative guy?

You know hes okay. That independent line doesnt always work for me.

Bill OReilly is a true conservative and a smart conservative, Gov. Brewer said.

Watters: I wouldnt go that far.

Bill OReilly is also an ego maniac.

I like Bill because Bill is always Bill, and you can count on Bill.

Watters to Beck: Seems like youve been missing Bill. I can see it in your eyes.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Iran reportedly test-fires 2 long-range missiles while Biden visits Israel,[],"Iran reportedly test-fired two ballistic missiles Wednesday with the phrase ""Israel must be wiped out"" written in Hebrew on them, but authorities said that the tests do not violate the nuclear deal reached in January.

The tests came as Vice President Joe Biden visited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was strongly opposed to the nuke deal.

I want to reiterate because I know people still doubt: If in fact they break the deal, we will act, Biden said in Jerusalem.

The semiofficial Fars news agency offered pictures Wednesday it said were of the Qadr H missiles being fired. It said they were fired in Iran's eastern Alborz mountain range to hit a target some 870 miles away off Iran's coast into the Sea of Oman.

Hard-liners in Iran's military have fired rockets and missiles despite U.S. objections since the deal, as well as shown underground missile bases on state television.

The missiles fired today are the results of sanctions, Brig. Gen. Hossein Salami, a deputy commander of the Guards told Fars news agency, according to the BBC. The sanctions helped Iran develop its missile program.

There was no immediate reaction from Jerusalem, where Biden was scheduled to speak to Netanyahu.

The U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which patrols that region, declined to comment on the test. Fars quoted Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of Iran's Revolutionary Guard's aerospace division, saying the test was aimed at showing Israel that Iran could hit it.

Iranian state television showed one of the missiles being fired from an underground silo sometime overnight, Reuters reported.

""The 1,240-mile range of our missiles is to confront the Zionist regime,"" Hajizadeh said. ""Israel is surrounded by Islamic countries and it will not last long in a war. It will collapse even before being hit by these missiles.""

Israel's Foreign Ministry declined to immediately comment. Iran has threatened to destroy Israel in the past. Israel, which is believed to have the only nuclear weapons arsenal in the Mideast, repeatedly has threatened to take military action against Iran's nuclear facilities.

Hajizadeh stressed Iran would not fire the missiles in anger or start a war with Israel.

""We will not be the ones who start a war, but we will not be taken by surprise, so we put our facilities somewhere that our enemies cannot destroy them so that we could continue long war,"" he said.

The firing of the Qadr H missiles comes after a U.S. State Department spokesman on Tuesday criticized another missile launch that day, saying America planned to bring it before the United Nations Security Council.

A nuclear deal between Iran and world powers including the U.S. is now under way, negotiated by the administration of moderate President Hassan Rouhani. In the time since the deal, however, hard-liners in Iran's military have made several shows of strength.

In October, Iran successfully test-fired a new guided long-range ballistic surface-to-surface missile. It was the first such test since Iran and world powers reached a landmark nuclear deal last summer.

U.N. experts said the launch used ballistic missile technology banned under a Security Council resolution. In January, the U.S. imposed new sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the ballistic missile program.

Iran also has fired rockets near U.S. warships and flown an unarmed drone over an American aircraft carrier in recent months.

In January, Iran seized 10 U.S. sailors in the Gulf when their two riverine command boats headed from Kuwait to Bahrain ended up in Iranian territorial waters after the crews ""misnavigated,"" the U.S. military said. The sailors were taken to a small port facility on Farsi Island, held for about 15 hours and released after U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry spoke several times with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif.

Camille Cosby testified last month in the civil case filed in federal court in Massachusetts by seven women who claim he sexually assaulted them decades ago. The women allege the actor-comedian defamed them when his representatives branded them as liars after they went public with their allegations.

An excerpt of Camille Cosby's deposition was attached to a court filing Monday by Bill Cosby's lawyers seeking to suspend the defamation case while a criminal case is pending against him in Pennsylvania. In that case, Cosby is charged with sexually assaulting former Temple University employee Andrea Constand.

In the Constand case, Cosby acknowledged in a 2005 deposition, made public last year, that he gave quaaludes to at least one woman and unidentified others he wanted to have sex with.

Camille Cosby says in her testimony in February that she and her husband discussed his deposition in the Constand case, but she wouldn't say specifically what they discussed about it. A U.S. District Court judge in Massachusetts had ruled that she could refuse to answer questions that call for testimony prohibited by the Massachusetts marital disqualification rule, which generally prohibits spouses from testifying about private marital conversations.

More on this... Bill Cosby's wife Camille subject of compassion, anger regarding husband's sex abuse scandal

In the February deposition excerpt, Camille Cosby says she learned of Constand's allegations through her husband. The back-and-forth between Camille Cosby's lawyers and a lawyer for the seven women, Joseph Cammarata, became combative when Camille Cosby referred to private conversations she had with her husband.

When Cammarata asked her whether she had a discussion with her husband about the substance of his deposition testimony in the Constand case, Camille Cosby replies: ""That is just communication between my husband and me.""

After her lawyer advises her that she can answer ""yes"" or ""no"" whether she's discussed it without divulging any of what was said, Camille Cosby answers, ""Yes,"" saying she did discuss his deposition testimony with him.

The seven women who brought the defamation lawsuit are among about 50 women who have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct. He has denied their allegations.

Cosby, 78, has pleaded not guilty in the Pennsylvania case, the only criminal case against him.

Through a spokesman, lawyers for Bill and Camille Cosby declined to comment on Camille Cosby's deposition. Cammarata also declined to comment.",[]

A defense official, who had knowledge of drone use inside the U.S. and spoke to Fox News, detailed several missions: Helping first responders extinguish forest fires in California in 2013; assisting in two search-and-rescue missions in California in 2015; helping stop recent flooding in Mississippi and South Carolina.

In those cases, requests were made by organizations such as FEMA, the California Office of Emergency Services and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers



""We felt like we could help,"" said the official, who had

knowledge of the military's drone use inside the U.S. ""We were

supporting first responders.""



But that explanation differed from the description of the drone program in a USA Today report that portrayed the unmanned aerial vehicles as being used to ""spy over U.S. territory.""



USA Today, which first reported in-depth about the flights on Wednesday, cited a Pentagon inspector general report that was recently made public by a Freedom of Information Act request as the source of most of its information.



That report said fewer than 20 such flights had occurred between 2006 and 2015 and all had been lawful.

The document provided no details of any approved mission. One example of a request, however, indicated an unidentified mayor asked the Marine Corps to fly a drone over his city to find potholes. The request was denied because it did not make operational sense.

Under 2006 guidelines established by the Pentagon, military drone use for civilian missions had to be approved by the secretary of defense or someone delegated by the secretary, USA Today reported. No defense secretaries have ever delegated that responsibility, according to the report. In 2015, those rules were altered so that only the secretary of defense could grant approval for missions, and drones could only be flown for testing or training.

Then-FBI Director Robert Mueller first revealed in 2013 testimony before Congress that drones had flown over the U.S.

Buhari made the comments Tuesday during a visit to Nigeria by South African President Jacob Zuma, the BBC reports.

MTN missed a mid-2015 deadline to disconnect cards, according to the report.

""You know how the unregistered [sim cards] are being used by terrorists and between 2009 and today, at least 10,000 Nigerians were killed by Boko Haram,"" said Buhari, during a joint press conference with Zuma. ""Unfortunately, MTN was very very slow and contributed to the casualties,"" he added, in his first public comments on the case.

The phone giant was fined $5.2 billion in October by Nigerias telecoms industry regulator for failing to disconnect the cards, although this was later reduced to $3.4 billion. Last month MTN announced that it has paid $250 million in a goodwill gesture towards a possible settlement in the case.

MTN provides service to over 200 million people in Africa and the Middle East. Nigeria is reportedly the phone giants largest market.

Dozens of emaciated-looking Boko Haram members begging for food have surrendered in northeast Nigeria, the military and a civilian self-defense fighter said last week.

Food shortages could indicate that Nigeria's military is succeeding in choking supply routes of the Islamic extremists who have taken their fight across Nigeria's borders. Some 20,000 people have died in the six-year uprising.

And they deleted it (but here it is in case you were wondering): pic.twitter.com/tZmXPlQXvp  T. Becket Adams (@BecketAdams) March 8, 2016

The tweet drew immediate fire from Duckworths campaign, which called the tweet tasteless and dishonest.

""Tasteless and dishonest, just like everything else to do with Mark Kirks flailing campaign, campaign spokesman Matt McGrath said in a statement. Tammy has made fighting for Veterans her lifes work, and will continue to do so in the Senate.

The NRSC acknowledged the mistake and said the tweet was deleted within minutes. However, a spokeswoman for the group saw media bias at play.

It would be great if reporters would pay as much attention to a deleted tweet as they should to Tammy Duckworth being sued by VA whistleblowers for ignoring claims of mistreatment and corruption, the spokeswoman said.

This statement was in turn criticized by the groups Democratic counterpart.

The NRSC's deeply offensive tweet about Tammy Duckworth was wrong, and their subsequent response was somehow even more appalling, DSCC Executive Director Tom Lopach said in a statement.

Instead of taking responsibility and apologizing to Tammy, who lost both of her legs in service to this country, Republicans blamed the media. Thats unacceptable and Tammy is owed an apology, Lopach said.

He cant afford $100, let alone $28 million, Michael David Barretts father, Francis, said at his Portland, Ore., home Tuesday. If he could, he wouldnt be living in my basement.

The jury decided Monday Andrews should be awarded nearly $55 million for the video he made at a Nashville hotel, which is liable for $26.75 million.

The broke Barrett is well aware he screwed up his life, the dad said.

Its an awful thing, and he knows it, Francis Barrett said.

The convicted peeper, who spent 212 years in prison for stalking Andrews, typically goes to work as a truck driver at a meat packing plant in Portland every day, but on Tuesday he hid out in his dads basement.

Barrett, 54, was released from federal prison in 2012, and filed for bankruptcy the same year, listing $3,000 in assets, including clothing, golf clubs and a 1995 Toyota Avalon, records show. He was $159,891 in debt.

It remains to be seen how much Andrews will be able to collect.

Manhattan lawyer Susan Karten said theres no question the Nashville Marriott will appeal  and the appellate court could cap the damages.

Most likely theres going to be nothing there [from Barrett], said Karten, who has no connection to the case. You can always garnish a salary with a judgment, but how much could that be?

Meanwhile, one of the jurors, Terry Applegate, told The Post, We needed to come to a figure that would impact Erins situation and her eight years of dealing with this, as well as impact the hotel itself and the hotel industry so that they recognize the severity of what occurred.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,'He has fought: Fiorina endorses Cruz in Florida,[],"Former 2016 GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina resurfaced on the campaign trail Wednesday to endorse Ted Cruz, touting the Texas senators conservative credentials and arguing hes the only GOP candidate who can beat primary front-runner Donald Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton.

He has fought for our religious liberty. He has fought for our sovereignty, Fiorina said, before introducing Cruz at a campaign rally in Miami.

Fiorina, who dropped out of the 2016 race in February, called Cruz a leader and a reformer and took some shots at the primary front-runner in the process.

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin. Theyre not going to reform the system. They are the system, she said.

Her endorsement comes after Cruz walked away from Tuesdays primary contests with just one win, in Idaho, compared with Trumps three. The billionaire businessman won in Mississippi, Michigan and Hawaii, building his already substantial delegate lead over the field.

Florida, where Fiorina spoke, is among the five states set to vote next Tuesday and is one of the biggest battlegrounds.

Fiorina, a former Hewlett-Packard chief executive officer, said the argument that Cruz has made too many enemies on Capitol Hill only proves he is taking on the Washington cartel.

You have a very important job on Tuesday, said Fiorina, referring to Floridas primary, where Cruz is running behind Trump. Its time to take the party back. Its time to take our government back. Its time to take the country back. So its time to unite behind the only one who can, Ted Cruz.

foxnews.com,2016-03-02 00:00:00,"Trump is now unstoppable. It's game over for Cruz, Rubio, Kasich and Carson",['Edward Rollins'],"Game over! This was a rout, America. Winning seven states and the vast majority of delegates is a landslide. Donald Trump and the millions of his supporters have changed American politics and the Republican Party for the foreseeable future.

The nomination is within his grasp and if he does what he said he would do Tuesday night: ""[I will] be a unifier!"" he may be a very viable candidate against Hillary Clinton in the fall.

After his victories Tuesday night in multiple states and his second place finish in others , Trump is in an unstoppable position. Whether the junior senators from Texas and Florida choose to pursue him, it doesnt matter, the end is near.

Trump, who is an unconventional candidate, to say the least, has tapped into the anger and frustration across America and has mobilized voters to turn out in record numbers.

Love him or hate him, be inspired by him or be appalled by him, Trump has totally dominated a political cycle like no other politician Ive seen in decades.

I admit I was a total skeptic, like many others.

At first, I didnt think he would run.

Then I thought there was no way he could beat the all-star cast of elected officials running against him.

Then I underestimated his lack of substance and trite answers in the debates.

Then I underestimated his lack of a real campaign.

Then I was convinced the political establishment was going to spend millions and take him out. And like the Energizer bunny he just keeps going and winning!

Trump is getting stronger by the day and his supporters are locked in and not going away. And no one has mastered the media like this since Teddy Roosevelt and his rough riders.

What's ahead is a Republican Party that either becomes part of his movement or splinters into many pieces. No matter what Trump does or says, the nomination is his for the taking.

Winning politics is a game of addition. Trump needs to be more careful in his words and in his thoughts. He needs to be a more gracious winner.

He has convinced many voters that he is a leader and a change agent. Now he needs to add substance and surround himself with some advisers who can add to that substance.

Thursday nights GOP debate should be taken to a higher plane. All sides need to back away from the name calling and argue over the differences in policies.

All the candidates need to tell us how they will make the United States a better place and how they will beat Hillary and the Democrats this fall and why they should.

In the very near future, the Republican leadership of the Congress and the nations Republican governors need to sit down and do a ""Trump negotiation"" session.

Why? Because they need to see if they can find common ground to run on.

Trump is the ultimate salesman and he needs to sell these guys on his candidacy and convince them that together they can make it work.

If not, a holy war lies ahead that will destroy the Republican Party as we know it. And worse, Hillary Clinton may end up becoming president. -- Just as I underestimated Donald Trump, Republicans will be foolish if we underestimate Hillary Clinton.

My last advice is this: Mr. Trump, if youre going to reward Governor Christie for his endorsement by letting him introduce you, get him off the stage once he's done.

No one seemed more unhappy than Christie watching you speak in Florida Tuesday night and frowning throughout your press conference.

A gracious loser he's not!

MARIA BARTIROMO, HOST: Good morning. Allies united against ISIS. Hi, everyone. I'm Maria Bartiromo. Welcome to ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

Jordan pounding ISIS targets this morning. The UAE back in the battle supplying more planes.

Now how should Americans add our own muscle to the fight against ISIS? We're covering this story throughout the program this morning with congressional and military guests.

The GOP presents its plan to erase ObamaCare.

Is it better? Is it likely to pass? We'll discuss the details of that and a lot more with Senator John Hoeven coming up.

And a full court press by the West to end the Russian-Ukraine conflict. How far did they get? We'll take a look and talk to a business man with an insider's view of just how corrupt post-Communist Russia really is. He barely escaped with his life. Others, not so lucky. He'll tell us his first-hand story as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

(MUSIC PLAYING)

BARTIROMO: And Jordan continues to pound ISIS strongholds this morning, not believing the terror group's claim that a Jordanian airstrike has killed U.S. hostage Kayla Mueller.

Meanwhile the president plans to formally ask Congress to authorize the use of military force against ISIS in the coming days.

What should the U.S. response be now? Congressman Bob Goodlatte is with me, he's the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and he joins us now.

Good to see you, Congressman. Thanks for joining us.

REP. BOB GOODLATTE, R-VA.: Thank you, Maria.

BARTIROMO: So what should the U.S.' response look like, when we hear from the president to authorize the use of military forces, what do you think that force should look like?

GOODLATTE: I believe for a long time that the current authorization for use of military force in Iraq, now more than a dozen years old, is out of date, needs to be replaced. We should take a careful look at what the president presents to us, recognizing it's a good thing that Jordan and some of the Gulf states and others in the Middle East are recognizing they're on the front lines.

The threat is to them. And they should step up. We should support them and we should give the president appropriate authority to do that support.

Now one of the big questions, of course, will be what about boots on the ground?

Again, we've got to be careful not to tie the president's hands. But we do not want to have major U.S. military ground forces placed back in an area where we think others should be stepping up and taking the lead. But targeted strikes and rescue missions and a whole host of other activities, spotters on the ground and so on, we need to give the president some flexibility in this area. But we need to look carefully at an appropriate authorization of use of military force.

BARTIROMO: The U.S. has been carrying out airstrikes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq since August.

Has it worked?

GOODLATTE: I think it has definitely helped. There is no question that we've turned them back in a few places. We've seen some towns recovered by Kurdish forces and other forces in the area. But obviously more needs to be done.

I think that some of the terrorist acts that they have taken place, burning Jordanian air force officer in a cage, may be a reflection of their desperation more than it is simply their barbarity. But either way, I think this is a long-term battle against Islamic radical terrorists. And we need to make sure we're doing our part.

It's not just happening in the Middle East. FBI Director Comey said in Mississippi just a couple of days ago that they have active investigations of suspected ISIS collaborators in 49 states. So this is something we can't simply allow to say it's going to happen in someplace else and we don't need to be involved in it. We do need to be involved.

(CROSSTALK)

BARTIROMO: Yes, Congressman. I wanted to hear more about that and I also want to ask you about the idea of cyber security and Internet terrorism. So stay with us, Congressman Bob Goodlatte.

First, let's dig deeper into the scope of Jordan's fight against ISIS. Fox News senior correspondent Eric Shawn joins us now with that angle.

Good morning to you, Eric.

ERIC SHAWN, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.

And good morning, everyone. It has a king who is also an attack helicopter pilot who did not hesitate to strike back. King Abdullah is leading not from behind, but from the front.

A monarch in a flight suit, a potent symbol of Jordan's defiance against ISIS, 53-year-old King Abdullah, who served in the Royal Jordanian Army and flew Cobra antitank helicopters in the air force, is now taking the fight directly against the ISIS killers.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

MOHAMMAD AL MOMANI, STATE MINISTER FOR MEDIA AFFAIRS, JORDAN: We will do whatever it takes in order to fight this organization and defeat this organization. We think this is the best of our country. Of course we strongly believe that other countries in the region as well as the international community must shoulder part of the responsibility.

SHAWN (voice-over): Jordan vows that a, quote, ""relentless war against ISIS"" and has carried out four days of continuing airstrikes in revenge for that barbaric burning to death of its pilot, despite being dwarfed by larger militaries. The country ranks number 67th, according to global firepower and military strength with a defense budget of $1.5 billion. It can field just over 110,000 active military personnel. The air force has 246 military aircraft, including 74 fighters or interceptors and 42 fixed-wing attack aircraft.

But like the U.S., Jordan continues to rule out sending so-called boots on the ground. Even though Iraq and Syria's Arab and Persian Gulf neighbors can potentially field armies of more than 1 million troops against the Islamic State. But for now have no plans to do that.

AL MOMANI: I think that nobody is talking about troops on the ground. The idea about boots on the ground is that we will help the Iraqi military.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

SHAWN: But Jordan says since that unforgivable video was released, it has launched 56 strikes against ISIS and has so far flown 946 sorties out of a total of 5,500 coalition airstrikes or just under 20 percent. Scrawled on a Jordanian bomb that was hanging under a jet fighter just before a mission against ISIS was one simple message. It said, ""For you, the enemies of Islam."" -- Maria.

BARTIROMO: All right, Eric, thanks very much, Eric Shawn with the latest there.

More now with Congressman Bob Goodlatte.

And, Congressman, you have been a leader in terms of Internet and technology issues on your committee. Let me get your take on your expectations for cyber terrorism and whether or not this is an area that you think ISIS will next pursue.

GOODLATTE: Well, it is certainly something that various elements of terrorist organizations have pursued and the United States needs to step up its game. Greater cooperation between government agencies, greater cooperation between private companies and the government in making sure that cyber attacks of various kinds are repulsed. We need to make sure our intelligence organizations have the ability to gather the information they need but not at the expense of the civil liberties of law abiding American citizens.

We passed a good bill through Congress last year to take up again this year offered by Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner that set, I think, the right guidelines, barred the government from collection of metadata but still gave them the opportunity to do what they need to do to gather the information to investigate terrorist plots that can take place in the United States and elsewhere in the world.

BARTIROMO: Congressman, lay out the next two days for us when the president asks Congress for the authority for more military force.

How does this play out this upcoming week?

GOODLATTE: We should take that and look at it very carefully. I don't think we need to rush into giving a very quick response. Remember the president has had a mixed record here. He did not seek authorization for use of military force to go into Libya. Many complications have ensued from that.

He then sought the authorization to go into Syria against the current Syrian government. That got a very negative response from the Congress. I think there's more open-mindedness right now about finding the right balance here in terms of giving him the authority that he needs without us stepping out in front of these Middle Eastern nations like Jordan that need to take the lead in protecting their region and in fighting ISIS. But we should be strong supporters of what they're doing.

BARTIROMO: And Jordan is one of a handful of Middle Eastern countries that have joined the fight against ISIS.

Are you expecting that number to increase?

GOODLATTE: I certainly hope it will because they clearly are the ones who are on the front lines. This kind of radical terrorism is not what I think they want the world to see about the Middle East. There have been Muslim clerics around the world speaking out against the horrific acts taken by ISIS and we need to get their help in pushing back on this because this is a long-term problem with extremism trying to take hold, not just in the Middle East. We saw it in France just recently and we've seen it in the United States before and we'll see it again if we're not proactive in combating it.

BARTIROMO: Congressman, we'll be watching. Thanks very much for joining us today.

GOODLATTE: Thanks, Maria.

BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A group of congressional Republicans, Senators Richard Burr and Orrin Hatch and Congressman Upton have unveiled their place -- their plan to replace ObamaCare. It is similar to an outline proposed last year by Burr, Hatch and former Senator Tom Coburn.

It includes targeted tax credits for those living up to 300 percent above the poverty line, allowing insurance companies to sell plans across state lines, repealing the individual mandate. But, like ObamaCare, kids can stay on their parents' plans until they're 26 years old. And pre- existing conditions are covered, that is, unless you let your coverage lapse for a couple of months, under the GOP plan. Insurers could take that into account.

Senator John Hoeven is joining us. He is on the Appropriations Committee and the Energy Committee.

Senator, good to have you on the program.

SEN. JOHN HOEVEN, R-N.D.: Thanks, Maria. Good to be with you.

BARTIROMO: What is the viability of this new replacement to ObamaCare, do you think?

HOEVEN: I think it's a good plan. It's about empowering people rather than expanding government. And if the Supreme Court strikes down the subsidy that states are getting under the federal exchange, we're going to have to have another plan. And I hope there's some support both in the Congress and on the part of the administration to go to this kind of approach.

BARTIROMO: What kind of an impact have you seen so far from anticipation of ObamaCare or actual implementation of ObamaCare?

HOEVEN: I'm -- your question on the...

BARTIROMO: What kind of an impact have you seen already in terms of businesses, in terms of the economy, people's lives?

HOEVEN: Yeah, I mean higher costs, not only for businesses but for individuals in terms of their health care insurance. And that's why the kind of plan that we're talking about now can create more competition and help bring health care costs down and gives people more choice.

BARTIROMO: What would you like to see in terms of other priorities for the budget?

The president released his budget. What is your response in terms of what he's likely to do in terms of raising taxes and -- and creating more revenue for things like education and infrastructure projects?

HOEVEN: Well, his budget is a real problem. And I don't believe it's going to go anywhere in Congress. If you look at it, it's $2.1 trillion in higher taxes. It's $2.4 trillion in more spending. It's $8.5 trillion over 10 years in more debt for this country. And that makes it harder for entrepreneurs and small businesses to create jobs and grow the economy. And so that's not what Americans want. That's why Congress is not going to go that direction. What we're going to try to do is do things like reduce the regulatory burden, engage in tax reform that stimulates our economy and encourages job creation for our businesses across this great country.

BARTIROMO: And how does this ObamaCare plan, or replacement plan, do that?

HOEVEN: Well, the -- it helps by giving more choice, more competition, reducing the regulatory burden -- again, not only helping our businesses in terms of reducing costs, giving them more options, but for individuals as well. That's the kind of thing that makes our economy go. When you make it easier to do business, then entrepreneurs, small businesses create more jobs. When you make it more expensive, you have higher tax burden, more regulation, that's what hurts job creation.

BARTIROMO: Senator, let me move on to the Keystone Pipeline, which I know you have been pushing passage for. But I want to start with North Dakota. Because North Dakota, of course, is a very big oil-producing state, producing more than a million barrels of oil a day, second largest oil producing state. What has been the impact on the state of this sharp sell- off in the price of oil that we've seen in the last year?

HOEVEN: Maria, we're starting to see some slowdown. Obviously, the price of oil now just a little over $50 a barrel. You know, actually, we're locked in a global competition to see who's going to supply energy globally. So OPEC, Russia, now the United States. You know, we're battling for market share. So we have to continue to help build our industry in this country. So far we've seen some slowdown in our state, not too much. How much more we'll see depends on what happens with the price.

BARTIROMO: Right. I mean, is it fair to say that the -- the rise in supply, whether it's the shale revolution in America or OPEC and non-OPEC countries, that's the reason oil prices have come down so much?

HOEVEN: Maria, without question, one of the things I often see is OPEC didn't decide to give us a Christmas present this year. The reason gas prices are lower, dropping over the last year from something like $3.27 a gallon down to about $2.17 a gallon is because we're producing so much more energy. And that's how it works. If we continue to grow our energy base in this country, we not only become energy secure but we reduce the price at the pump for our consumers. The benefit they've received so far would be, if it were a tax cut, would be equal to more than $100 billion in the consumer's pocket.

BARTIROMO: Yeah, I mean, you have been talking about the importance of the Keystone XL Pipeline, and yet the president continues to say he is going to veto this. So these threats continue. What are you going to do if the president vetoes this in the next couple of weeks?

HOEVEN: You know, Maria, that's the great irony. We're producing more energy; it's strengthening our country; it's helping our allies; it's benefiting consumers and businesses, you know, throughout our economy.

And now the president, on the one hand, takes credit for it, and then, on the other hand, he is trying to block it. We need the infrastructure and we have to build the business climate so we can produce more energy, not less, here in North America. And then we don't have to depend on OPEC for oil, and we're stronger as a country and we have a stronger economy.

BARTIROMO: Yeah, I think it's also worth mentioning the fact that the oil is going to get here by hook or crook. It's only going to come on rail cars as opposed to coming through a pipeline. And we're already seeing a real capacity congestion on the tracks, right, because oil is being transported on rail car?

HOEVEN: You make a great point. That oil is going to move either by rail or by pipeline. If it moves by rail, that's 1,400 rail cars a day which not only creates more congestion, more risk of accident, that kind of thing, but it also blocks our movement of other goods. The safest way to do it, the most cost-effective way to do it, with the best environmental stewardship, is with the proper infrastructure, the right mix of pipelines, rail and roads.

BARTIROMO: Senator, good to have you on the program. We'll be watching the developments. Thanks so much.

HOEVEN: Thanks, Maria.

He is the author of ""Red Notice"", a true story of high-finance murder and one man's fight for justice. He is Bill Browder.

BILL BROWDER, AUTHOR: Good to see you.

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. First off, let's talk about the issues of the day. Ukraine needs help. Larry Summers was on this program last week basically saying it is more important for us to be doing helpful things for Ukraine like sending them armament than fighting Russia. Because, if you fight Russia, you're pushing Putin in a corner, and he is going to fight back even more aggressively.

BROWDER: Well, the first thing you have to know is that Putin started this war. Putin is doing this war for internal Russian domestic reasons. He's trying to distract his own population from his corruption. And so this war is not about any historic ties with Ukraine or about NATO. This is Putin aggressively attacking Russia (sic) to try to get people stirred up into a nationalist frenzy.

And so Putin will not back down in Ukraine. Anything that -- and there's basically nothing we can do to talk him into backing down, which means that the only choice we have in the West is to put pressure on him.

BARTIROMO: So do you think the U.S. should be aiding Ukraine with armaments?

BROWDER: Absolutely. I mean, so either we're going to have to go and fight Russia ourselves or let the Ukrainians fight Russia. But right now, they're getting slaughtered because Russia has an enormous amount of money to invest in military equipment; Ukraine has effectively run out of their military equipment and they need as much help as they can get.

And that's the one thing we can do without directly going to war with Russia ourselves.

BARTIROMO: All right. I want to talk about your story in particular. Because you really -- you have an inside, first-hand account. At one point in your career you were running money; you were an investment manager, and you were the single largest investor in Russia.

BROWDER: Yeah.

BARTIROMO: Tell us what happened?

BROWDER: So I was -- I was investing in Russia. I discovered that the companies I was investing in were run corruptly by corrupt oligarchs. We started to fight the corruption. That angered the -- that angered Putin and his cronies. I was expelled from the country. My offices were raided. They tried to seize my companies. And they ended up stealing $230 million of taxes that we paid.

I hired a young lawyer named Sergei Magnitsky to investigate. He discovered the crime, testified against the officials. He was then arrested, tortured...

BARTIROMO: In -- in Russia?

BROWDER: In Russia. He was arrested in Russia by the people he testified against. He was then tortured for 358 days in Russian custody and killed. And then, after they killed him, they then exonerated everybody involved and put him on trial, after he died, in the first ever trial against a dead man in the history of Russia. They put me on trial as his co-defendant. And we said to ourselves ""Russia is bent from top to bottom,"" after that, and looked for justice outside of Russia.

BARTIROMO: How do you know that -- and you think Putin ordered this killing of your lawyer?

BROWDER: I don't know if Putin ordered this killing, but I can say with 100 percent certainty that Putin has been involved in the cover-up of his murder. And we have evidence of that. So here you have the president of a country where his -- it wasn't my money that was stolen. It was his own tax money that was stolen from his own Treasury; $230 million stolen from his country. A young man tries to be patriotic. That young man is killed for exposing it. And then he's involved in the cover-up of that young man's murder.

BARTIROMO: So what does this -- your experience tell you about dealing with Putin and about dealing in, you know, post-Soviet Russia?

BROWDER: Basically, what this tells you is that Putin is a criminal, first and foremost. He's running a criminal enterprise to maximize profits. He's a criminal, but he's different than the Mafia of Italy or the Mafia of -- of New York in that he has all the powers of a sovereign state. He can arrest people; he can go to the United Nations. He has a -- he has his finger on a nuclear button if he wants to use that. So you have a Mafia boss with his finger on a nuclear button.

BARTIROMO: And yet you have this popularity ranking that keeps coming out, that the people love him. Is that a complete lie? Are they just afraid?

BROWDER: Well, let me ask you this. If you were living in Russia, a totalitarian state, and where bad things happen to people who oppose the president, and some stranger calls you up from the Levada polling agency and says, ""Do you support the president or not,"" what's your answer going to be?

BARTIROMO: Yeah, I -- I understand.

So where do you think this goes? In terms of Putin and Russia taking over Crimea, moving further into Ukraine, what are your expectations of how this plays out?

BROWDER: Well, so I think the whole thing is based on the fact that Putin is a kleptocrat and he needed something to distract the people. And so he needed to start a war to -- to get everyone whipped up into a big nationalist frenzy.

They're in a nationalist frenzy that -- and in response to that, there's an economic crisis because of sanctions. And so he's got to whip people into a further nationalist frenzy. And so I don't think -- so he's not going to back down from Ukraine.

And my fear, and I think this is very likely, is that he's going to start exploring his military ambitions in other countries. And the thing that's most worrying is the Baltics. Because the Baltics are part of NATO. And NATO is -- is an organization in which the United States and Europe are all treaty members, which means that, if he goes into the Baltics, we have an -- either an obligation to fight Russia to protect the Baltics or NATO falls apart.

BARTIROMO: Quite extraordinary. Bill, the book is ""Red Notice: A True Story of High Finance, Murder and One Man's Fight for Justice."" Thank you very much for joining us, Bill.

BROWDER: Thank you.

BARTIROMO: Bill Browder joining us here.

Up next, back to our top story, how should the U.S. respond militarily to ISIS at this point? Lieutenant General Dan Bolger is on deck, as we look ahead on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: And back to our top story, as we await any word on U.S. hostage Kayla Mueller, what should the U.S. military response against ISIS be at this point?

Retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Daniel Bolger is the author of ""Why We Lost: A General's Inside Account of the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars.""

Sir, good to have you back on the program.

Welcome.

LT. GEN. DANIEL BOLGER (RET.), U.S. ARMY: Hello, Maria.

BARTIROMO: What should the U.S. response be at this point?

The president will be asking for increased military authority against ISIS in the coming days.

BOLGER: Well, you -- you named one of the big things, and that's to get the domestic support of the American people as expressed through their elected representatives in Congress.

Real, real important because this is a long-term struggle.

Yes, you've seen some -- some accelerated air strikes in the wake of the death of the Jordanian pilot, Lieutenant al-Kasasbeh, a heinous execution done on film by ISIS. They don't do that just to be awful. They do that because it excites people and causes them to want to join ISIS, young -- young men, primarily, in that region.

It's a long-term struggle, Maria. And it means we've got to be in it for the long haul. And that's why that Congressional authorization is really important.

BARTIROMO: And, of course, Jordan has really stepped up, accelerating its response against ISIS.

How would you characterize Jordan's response?

BOLGER: Well, Maria, Jordan is a -- is a strong ally in that region. They're a front line state. ISIS is not something that happens around the world. It's right next door. They've got challenges right on their border.

They've had al Qaeda and ISIS operatives in their own country.

King Abdullah is himself military trained. He went to Sandhurst, the British military academy, the equivalent of our West Point. He's a -- he's a qualified Special Forces officer, he's a qualified pilot.

So when he gives the order for his -- for his military to retaliate against ISIS, he knows exactly what he's telling people to do because he's done it himself.

And I'll tell you the other thing that were not seeing. All these air strike videos are impressive, but what we're not seeing behind the scenes that's even more important is this strong effort to tigis -- target ISIS leadership.

ISIS leaders like Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who was on our target list back when we were in Iraq in 2003 to '11, guys like him should to go sleep every night worrying that the door is going to get busted in and they're going to get shoot right between the eyes.

BARTIROMO: And -- and we do have the proper sort of intelligence to target that leadership, you think?

BOLGER: We're working on it. I'll tell you, this is where the Jordanians and the other states in the region come in. And they're very important.

Jordan has excellent intelligence services. Ours are good. We also have our other friends in that region to include the Iraqis and then the Kurdish militias that are part of Iraq.

Altogether, it's going to paint a picture that's going allow us to put that pressure and -- and threat to that ISIS leadership.

And it's going after their leaders that's going to -- going to do the most damage.

But again, a long, long effort. We're talking years before we see final results.

BARTIROMO: But the president is going to be asking for more military support.

Do you think that support should include boots on the ground?

BOLGER: Well, Maria, it already does. But the boots on the ground should not be Americans. We learned in our -- our campaign in Iraq in '03 to '11, as great as our young men and women are, it's very difficult for 100,000 Americans to lead a counterinsurgency and -- and build a successful state in the face of local rebels.

The right answer is for us to back the local people as they try and sort out their own problems. That's what the president is asking for. And to me, it shows that we have learned some lessons from what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan.

BARTIROMO: You know, in the last two weeks or so, there has been a feeling that ISIS has become desperate, that, in fact, we have been effective in terms of, as you say, taking down some of the leadership.

But as a result, they have begun to falter.

Do you agree with that notion?

BOLGER: I do not. One of the things you've got to watch in a country like Iraq, it's natural for the enemies there to take a little bit of a break when the weather gets rainy, as it does in their winter there. It's not as extreme as winter in the Northeast United States, but -- but it's definitely a change of season.

You'll see an ISIS spring offensive. ISIS has strong presence in the Sunni Arab areas of -- of Syria and Iraq and -- and they're -- it's going to take a lot of work to get them out of there.

These -- these despicable actions they're taking against people like that Jordanian pilot, they're being done to allow for recruiting. I wish it was desperation because they were under pressure, but I don't think we're there yet.

BARTIROMO: All right, we will leave it there.

General, we'll be watching.

Thanks very much for joining us today.

BOLGER: Thanks.

BARTIROMO: We'll see you soon.

Lieutenant General Daniel Bolger.

Now, let's get a look at what's coming up on ""MediaBuzz"" top of the hour with Howard Kurtz -- Howie, good morning to you.

HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, ""MEDIABUZZ"": Good morning, Maria.

We've got exclusive new details of the Brian Williams debacle at NBC, including that he decided voluntarily to take a leave of absence yesterday. He wasn't pushed to do so by NBC executives.

And there is no internal investigation at NBC. It's a fact-gathering inquiry to help the network play defense.

And as we look at whether he can survive this credibility crisis at NBC, it must be particularly fascinating for you, as somebody who spent two decades at that organization.

BOLGER: Well, it's interesting. So -- so but basically what I hear you saying, Howie, is that NBC is not doing anything.

The question is, will NBC's credibility continue to come down if, in fact, Brian Williams' credibility is on the line?

KURTZ: I think what's clear here is that Brian Williams has to do more to answer the questions not just about what happened in Iraq, where he has now acknowledged peddling a false story, but other questions being raised about other parts of his reporting.

If he can't do that, then NBC, I think, is going to have to make a very difficult decision.

BARTIROMO: Howie, we'll be there in 20 minutes.

Thanks so much.

We'll see you at the top of the hour.

KURTZ: Thanks.

BARTIROMO: Howard Kurtz.

The presidential candidates show their hands. Jeb Bush defines his platform in Detroit. Chris Christie tries to pick up some overseas cred in the UK. Our panel on how they did, as we look ahead on Sunday Morning Futures.

Join us for the panel, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. We dive right in. You can't paint 2016 right now and bring in our panel. Ed Rollins is former principal White House advisor to President Reagan. He's been a long time strategist and business advisor.

(CROSSTALK)

BARTIROMO: And he's a Fox News political analyst.

ED ROLLINS, POLITICAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIST: Thank you.

BARTIROMO: My apologies, Ed.

ROLLINS: No problem.

BARTIROMO: Tony Sayegh is the former press aide to Jack Camp when Camp was the GOP vice presidential nominee. He's now president of talk radio news service and a FOX News contributor.

Douglas Holtz-Eakin is president of the American Action Forum. He's the former director of the Congressional Budget Office and he is the former chief economist for the Council of Economic Advisers.

Good to see everybody. Thanks very much for joining us.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thank you.

BARTIROMO: Can you assess for us the current playing field for 2016, Ed?

Who do you think are the real candidates at this point on the GOP side?

ROLLINS: We have got the strongest field since 1980. We have four or five very serious governors and four or five senators who will probably make the race.

I think at this point, Bush obviously has picked up the pieces of the Romney departure. He's sort of going to be the establishment candidate. He's raising a lot of money, putting a good, strong team together.

Governor Walker is getting a lot of attention the last couple of weeks. And there's several other governors who will get in here, who will basically raise the money and be very viable candidates. I think it's a wide-open field and no one has a big lead at this point.

BARTIROMO: Chris Christie is trying to get some international --

ROLLINS: He had about the worst 30 days anybody can have. He bombed his London trip, where he went off to do foreign policy; he brought press along and then he wouldn't talk to press. He got trapped in the vaccination story, which overshadowed everything else. I think ""The New York Times"" had done a real job on him last week on his expensive travel and the fact that he's made (INAUDIBLE) for only one person can travel the way he travels and that's him, being hosted by kings and Boehner (ph). So it's just -- I don't think it was a good week for him.

BARTIROMO: Tony Sayegh?

TONY SAYEGH: Well, the only person I think who enjoys the excesses of political luxury more is probably Hillary Clinton. And we know that's the case from reports continuing to come out. They've used The Clinton Foundation like their own American Express black card. So I think in the grand scheme of things, the report from ""The New York Times"" may have been to try to blunt some of the criticism that we're hearing more and more about Hillary.

But to Ed's point, I think the governor undeniably had a bad week. But I've watched him, I've observed him run two statewide races in a very overwhelmingly Democrat state. He's always seemed to manage his way back. He's a fight for sure. So I'm not ready to count him out.

But look, as far as international trips. You have Ted Cruz now in Munich in an international security conference; Scott Walker is going to England on a trade mission. Christie did a trade mission to Canada in December that was by far more successful. So these are all good maneuvers for them. But I don't think they really define their viability in terms of the field. And it's significantly early. Obviously I think Bush from the money perspective, the organization perspective, has the advantage. But you saw in the matter of two weeks Scott Walker from one speech in Iowa, the Freedom Forum, rise almost to nearly the top of the pack. He's leading polls in Des Moines, ""Des Moines Register"" So clearly this is a very fluent field but to Ed's point a very strong field.

DOUGLAS HOLTZ-EAKIN, AMERICAN ACTION FORUM: Scott Walker was at the American Action Forum this past Friday, gave a major policy address. And I was very impressed with him. I think what we'll see over the next year is, as Ed said, a big field with lots of quality candidates sorting out who can sell the access to the American dream.

They're united in their belief in small government, better economic growth, keeping taxes under control, light regulatory burdens. But believing that and convincing the American people that you can deliver that are very two different things. And that's the challenge.

BARTIROMO: And that's the point that you were making, that you can try to sell the American dream, but if people don't really think they have a shot for it to be achieved, you can't sell it.

ROLLINS: The one thing Walker has done -- and he did in the Iowa summit -- is he said here is what everybody else says they're going to do. This is what I've done. That's a pretty strong record. And some of these governors, which I think are the stars of our party, we have 31 Republican governors who have really done some interesting things. They have to go out and explain what they've done and how they've done it. That it's about leaders. This is going to be a race about leadership, who's the strongest --

(CROSSTALK)

BARTIROMO: For sure.

SAYEGH: And I think Jeb Bush's speech in Detroit, while light on specifics, actually set the right kind of theme. Reminds me of my old boss, Jack Kemp; Ed's old boss, Ronald Reagan.

You have to have the typical compassionate conservatism that we've known from the Bush family to be a mantra. You have to be able to connect on a real level with the American people in a way that they trust you have their best interest at heart before they decide to agree with your policies. And that's something I think Barack Obama, while failing in every objective measure with the economy, with serving middle class and other things in 2012, was able to convince the American people to support him again because, compared to Mitt Romney, who seemed a bit patrician and removed from the day-to-day life of the average American, he had at least their best interests at heart. And that's where I think you heard a lot of in that Bush speech which is very important.

BARTIROMO: That's a really good point.

HOLTZ-EAKIN: For '16, the interesting thing is that -- you know, we were talking -- Hillary Clinton has that problem now. She's not exciting her base. And she may be a high quality candidate, but there's a whole lot of the progressive wing that are just not enthused about a Clinton candidacy.

BARTIROMO: By the way, you said she's using the Clinton Global Initiative as a black card?

SAYEGH: The Clinton Foundation, as we've learned through a lot of investigative reports, has a lot explaining to do. And I think that her and Bill Clinton both are benefiting greatly from the generous wealth and contributions of people from all over the world. Look, I'm not suggesting it's illegal.

But if you're going to criticize Chris Christie for staying at a hotel room that cost a certain amount of money --

(CROSSTALK)

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- thousand dollars.

SAYEGH: -- I think you got to look into Hillary Clinton and see the kind of (INAUDIBLE) she's shown that removes her from the American people. We've learned from her contracts -- which, I don't, again, begrudge her from doing to go to speak. She's making $300,000 but she's also stipulating I'll only talk to 45 people on the rope line. This is not the populist I think the Democrats need in 2016.

BARTIROMO: All right. Hold this thought. We're going to continue this conversation.

We also have some good economic news this past week. Jobs numbers are positive and even wages have begun to move.

But can this last? Our panel on that as we look ahead on Sunday Morning Futures. We'll be right back.

(MUSIC PLAYING)

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Our panel is back, Ed Rollins, Tony Sayegh, Doug Holtz-Eakin.

Doug, what was your assessment of the jobs numbers on Friday?

They were better than expected, and an interesting part of the report was that wages went up. Do you believe it?

HOLTZ-EAKIN: Taken at face value, this is a strong report and one that's long overdue, quite frankly. Some reasons to be nervous are January is always tough. There's a lot of seasonal adjustment. If you think of last January, we had huge storms that depressed the economy. You're comparing it relative to things like that. So a lot of this could be in the seasonal adjustments and not carry on to February.

I think the key is to look in February and see if we get sustained wage growth, see if we get sustained job growth, and see if we can continue to see people try to come back (inaudible) and get a job.

The -- you know, the bad story of this recovery has been more Americans not working because they have given up and they're out entirely.

BARTIROMO: Right, the participation rate.

SAYEGH: And the other bad story is you have a president boasting about economic growth, which, albeit, is important and a good indicator, but meanwhile the middle class is shrinking. So they're not growing with this economic expansion that is occurring, long overdue, of course.

And that's where I think the Republicans have a sincere opportunity this year to win back the middle class in this country electorally, realign them back to the Republican side, whose policies clearly benefit the average American much more.

I mean, we've talked about this before. The president's solution to everything is raise the minimum wage and somehow reallocate wealth from -- from the top to the bottom, when, really...

BARTIROMO: Redistribute...

(CROSSTALK)

HOLTZ-EAKIN: It's all zero-sum.

(LAUGHTER)

SAYEGH: It really is growing this economy in a way that good-paying jobs are created and people can take care of themselves and live that American dream that many people feel, unfortunately, is not attainable anymore.

ROLLINS: You still have, no matter what the labor department puts out, you still have very nearly one-fourth of the country, one-fourth of the workforce who are underemployed by their standards or unemployed. That's a big number.

BARTIROMO: And -- and what good is economic growth, as you put it, when the middle class is not growing with the economic growth?

ROLLINS: Many people have taken two jobs to replace the one job they used to have. And that's...

(CROSSTALK)

HOLTZ-EAKIN: The president's out of ideas on how to fix it. So, I mean, it's real clear. I mean, his budget says we're not going to grow faster than 2.3 percent over the long term. That's appallingly low, below what we are now. So it's going to get worse, not better. That's hard to believe.

And so there's only -- his only approach is to double-down on strategy of let's take it from one place, put it in another place. The Republicans in this cycle have an obligation to re-explain how economies grow and how people benefit from that growth. We can't remain at 2.3 percent and meet our national goals.

SAYEGH: And you're seeing this realization, particularly, I think, in Jeb Bush's speech in Detroit. You know, he's talking about not just economic growth, which is an academic economic term, some economic opportunity and why that's important. Because growth, to people, again, in an economy that's growing but they're not feeling the benefit, is relatively meaningless, number one.

Number two, we do want a party and we do want a country that provides a safety net for people in need, and this is another Bush, kind of, play on words. And instead of saying, you know, ""Let's not trap people in dependency,"" he used the term ""a spider web of dependency"" in which you're, kind of, connoting that, once you're in there, you're stuck.

We have a president whose policies have reallocated more people than ever from the middle class into lower income and into greater government dependency. That's the Obama economic record. That's why Hillary's in trouble in 2016.

BARTIROMO: And -- and the redistribution we saw, once again, with the president's latest budget.

ROLLINS: Absolutely. When you basically have the gigantic numbers we have in entitlement and a total inability to basically adjust any of those, whatever else you try and do, you're going to be dragged down.

BARTIROMO: You say Hillary is in trouble in 2016 because of this?

SAYEGH: Well, look, you look at a -- a poll that just came out several weeks ago from Washington Post/NBC. The most important number, not the head-to-head numbers -- her name ID is high; her favorability is generally very high because she's stayed our of the limelight -- 71 percent of Americans want a different direction than Barack Obama...

BARTIROMO: Right.

SAYEGH: ... and how is she going to now, in some way, shape or form, present a new policy, a new agenda that's different than the president she served for her full term?

BARTIROMO: All right. Quick break and then, still to come, the one thing to watch in the week ahead, on ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" from our panel. Back in a moment.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Back with our panel. The one big thing to watch in the upcoming week. Ed Rollins?

ROLLINS: I'm watching the Ukraine situation. If the French and -- and Merkel can't basically make some resolve with Putin, we're going to push the sanctions and obviously it's going to have long-term effects. And I think, if we put troops or we put resources into Ukraine, we're going to basically start a Cold War.

BARTIROMO: Tony?

SAYEGH: I'm looking at Scott Walker's political stock. He's obviously on the rise, but this is also adding to more scrutiny from conservatives who, when they dig a little deeper, find that there are some things about the governor, who is very successful, obviously, in battling public-sector unions, that may not sit well with the conservative base.

BARTIROMO: I'll watch that, too. Doug?

HOLTZ-EAKIN: I'm watching to see if we can pass a bill in the House, a bill in the Senate, and send it to the president. That was the promise when Republicans took over the Congress and remains unfulfilled.

BARTIROMO: Yeah, you thought Keystone would fit the bill.

(LAUGHTER)

Gentlemen, thank you very much. Great panel.

I'm watching retail sales for the month of January. We will see if that cheap oil has in fact materialized with people spending money.

That will do it for ""Sunday Morning Futures."" Thanks for being with us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. See you tomorrow on the Fox Business Network on ""Opening Bell,"" 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Take a look at where you can find Fox Business on your cable network.

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,"Republican and Democratic Establishments Put On Notice: Trump Scores 3 Big Wins, Sanders Upsets Clinton In Michigan",[],"FoxNews.com

Bernie Sanders pulled off a shocking upset Tuesday night, beating Hillary Clinton in the Michigan Democratic primary  where some polls going into the race had him trailing by double-digits  and wiping out Clinton's win earlier in the night in Mississippi.

Republican front-runner Donald Trump, meanwhile, regained any momentum lost last weekend against Ted Cruz, sweeping to convincing victories in Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii, sending a message to the Republican establishment to jump on board  or get out of the way.

Fox News projects Cruz will win the Idaho GOP primary, with Trump placing second there.

But Trump's victories were more valuable in terms of delegates. And the results Tuesday also may help shape the fate of Marco Rubio, who appeared once again to finish the night failing to gain any delegates.

Cruz and John Kasich, meanwhile, were locked in a dogfight for second place in Michigan, the neighboring state to Ohio, where Kasich is counting on a win next week to salvage his campaign.

On the Democratic side, Clinton easily won Mississippis primary earlier Tuesday, thanks in part to her overwhelming support from black voters, and likely will pick up more delegates in Tuesdays contests than Sanders.

But the Vermont senators surprising Michigan win could give him a bounce as he and the rest of the candidates charge into the vital March 15 primaries in Florida, Ohio and three other big states. All 15 pre-election polls in Michigan this year showed Clinton leading Sanders by double-digits.

This is now the ninth and largest state that Sanders has won so far in the Democratic presidential campaign.

Sanders chief strategist John Weaver blasted out a memo touting the Michigan performance, saying the state provides a springboard into the races on March 15, the day the race will officially reset.""

For his part, Trump is looking to March 15 to sideline the rest of the GOP field for good  something he tried to start doing Tuesday night. At a press conference at his golf club in Juniper, Fla., he said of his remaining rivals, Theyre pretty much all gone.

Michigan was the biggest prize on the map Tuesday, with four states in total voting.

foxnews.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,"Our American Dream: Elizabeth Velez, a trailblazer in the construction business",['Rebekah Sager'],"Elizabeth Velez grew up among beams and scaffoldings. One of seven girls, as a little kid she would tag along with dad on all kinds of construction sites  the very first projects of the emporium that is now the Velez Organization, founded in 1972.

If I stayed home, Id have to clean up or take care of my younger sisters, said Velez, 48. But I really enjoyed going because it was always to different places such as schools and hospitals, community places that impact so many lives.

Today, Velez is not only a leader in the New York Citys construction industry, but is known to be a mentor to women and minorities.

Having completed close to a billion dollars worth of construction, Velez says it was a proposal she wrote while she was still an undergrad at Hofstra University School of Business in the 80s, that launched her career.

The idea was to partner with Katherine S. Wylde, President & CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit organization for the citys business leaders, established by David Rockefeller in 1979.

It was a new concept program to turn neighborhood builders/contractors into big developers, she told Fox News Latino. My proposal was picked, my fathers company was chosen for the pilot, she recalled. I never looked back.

Velez was barely 20 years old.

She said this experience as a young, inexperienced entrepreneur made her value mentorship above all else and led her to become a dedicated mentor to others.

I saw at a tender age the need for people to look out for one another. My dad instilled in me the mindset to always bring others along, Velez said.

She also encourages women to see construction as a pathway for a career.

Im such a proponent of the field. Its actually perfect for women. Its project-driven. Its flexible, so if a woman has children, she can leave her position and return without fear of losing ground; this is an inherent issue for women, Velez said.

Velez Organization has many buildings to boast of, most of which are contracted by public agencies and authorities throughout New York State. Also, Velez has its hand heavily in the health market, having worked on several projects including Queens Hospital Center, Harlem Hospital, Elmhurst Hospital and Columbia Universitys Center for Disease Prevention.

Despite much of the progress made with women and people of color in the industry, Velez said not much has changed in senior positions.

Minorities and women are more apt to hire women and minorities, she told FNL. You cant see advancement without opportunity in this area.

As a trustee on several boards, Velez remains an active promoter of diversity  with a special place in her heart for young girls.

Shes a trustee on the board of Boricua College, for example, a post-secondary institution tailored for Puerto Ricans where 80 percent of the student body is single mothers.

I enjoy talking with young girls, said Velez, herself a Puerto Rican. They dont see building on the spectrum. If they hear about it from someone who talks like them and looks like them, theyre more likely to hear the lesson, she said.

foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,Bruins-Lightning Preview,[],"Tampa Bay handled Boston easily just over a week ago to extend what would become a franchise-record winning streak that helped it vault into first place in the Atlantic Division.

After that run came to an emphatic end, the Lightning need to beat their division rivals for the third time this season to prevent the Bruins from catching them.

Boston can claim at least a share of the Atlantic lead by evening the season series with Tampa Bay on Tuesday night.

The Lightning (39-23-4) won nine straight after losing to San Jose on Feb. 16, allowing two goals or fewer seven times to pass Florida for the division lead. The run included a 4-1 win at Boston (37-23-7) on Feb. 28 as Ryan Callahan had two goals and an assist and Steven Stamkos scored on a penalty shot.

Tampa looked out of sorts Monday, though, and was outshot 40-18 in a 4-2 loss at Philadelphia. Ondrej Palat scored on one of the Lightning's three shots in the first period before the Flyers tied it while peppering goaltender Andrei Vasilevskiy with 22 shots in the second.

Vasilevskiy finished with 36 saves but allowed the first two goals of the third. The defensive unit was short-handed, as Braydon Coburn sat out the first of at least two with a lower-body injury and Andrej Sustr missed his third straight with an undisclosed ailment.

Slater Koekkoek was called up from the minors and had an assist for his first career point in his eighth NHL game.

""The beauty about this sport is we got a game tomorrow against a divisional opponent and we obviously have to have a bounce back,"" Stamkos said. ""I expect a bounce back from this group.""

Tampa has won two of three meetings with Boston and sits one point ahead of both Florida and the Bruins, who beat the Panthers 5-4 on Monday after Lee Stempniak scored in overtime for his first goal since coming over from New Jersey at the trade deadline.

Patrice Bergeron had two goals and has scored in four straight, giving him nine goals and five assists over his last 12. Brad Marchand had two assists for Boston, which began a stretch that has it playing 10 of 13 on the road.

Coach Claude Julien passed Art Ross to become Boston's career leader with 388 regular-season victories as the Bruins improved to 4-0-1 since losing to the Lightning. They've won three straight on the road and are 10-2-0 away from home since Jan. 15.

Julien wasn't in the mood to celebrate, though, after the Bruins blew a 3-0 lead.

""One of the worst periods I've seen in a long time from our hockey club,"" Julien said of the second. ""We got better in the third period, but we had to go to overtime to win. We're not a team that likes to give up that many goals.""

Defenseman Kevan Miller scored in the last meeting with Tampa Bay, but he was scratched Monday with an upper-body injury and his status for this contest is uncertain.

Tuukka Rask stopped 47 of the 51 shots he faced against the Panthers and could get a much-deserved night off in this one, especially considering he's posted a 4.55 goals-against average while dropping his last four starts against Tampa.

Jonas Gustavsson, who gave up five goals in a loss to Columbus in his last start Feb. 22, would get the nod if Rask sits.

Ben Bishop will be back in goal for the Lightning. He has a 1.48 GAA while winning his last six starts and made 32 saves in the last win over the Bruins.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Student senator faces impeachment for conservative beliefs,['Todd Starnes'],"Theres a witch hunt underway for conservatives at the University of Southern California  and Jacob Ellenhorn appears to be Public Enemy No. 1.

Ellenhorn is a student senator at USC and president of the College Republicans. He is also an outspoken conservative.

Click here to join Todds American Dispatch: a must-read for Conservatives!

And thats a big problem among his fellow student lawmakers at USC.

Ellenhorn is facing possible impeachment  accused of all sorts of tawdry behavior  like publicly expressing his conservative opinions and (brace yourself) inviting high-profile conservative speakers to campus.

It seems like freedom of speech and freedom to express your views is not allowed by the University of Southern California student government right now, he told me.

Ellenhorn accused liberal students of engaging in a witch hunt and committing institutionalized discrimination against me and my views.

If you voice a difference of opinion on any small issue  they lash out at you, he told me. Youre a racist, youre a homophobe, youre anti-woman, youre sexist. This is ridiculous.

The official complaint, first reported by Campus Reform, alleges that Ellenhorn created a hostile environments (sic) for our USC study body, and has also violated our USC Principles of Community by bringing a speaker and moderating an event that blatantly perpetuates sexism.

The Lefties were especially troubled when Ellenhorn invited Milo Yiannopoulos to speak last year.

PODCAST: Listen to Todds indepth interview with Jacob Ellenhorn

Stephen Smith, an adjunct professor and executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation, accused Yiannopoulos of being known for his anti-feminist and more broadly misogynist commentary.

Harmful speech has no place in the Trojan community, Smith wrote in a letter calling for Yiannopoulos to be disinvited.

Whatever Yiannopoulos has to say on campus, his invitation here calls into question the human values as well as the academic standards of the USC College republicans, he wrote. Controversial celebrity presenters may draw an audience, but the integrity of the USC College Republicans is rubbished by such content, the high standards of excellence we all try to uphold at USC are undermined, and the USC community as a whole is deeply offended on behalf of its women students, staff and faculty.

Ellenhorn admits that hes invited firebrand speakers like Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro.

They are claiming that because I invited them  I made students on campus feel unsafe, he said. No one has to listen to them. No one was forced to attend. For goodness sake  were adults. We should be able to handle other peoples opinions.

Senators are expected to hold hearings later this month to determine the young conservatives fate. But Ellenhorn doesnt seem to be all that intimidated.

He penned a fiery response to the complaint  accusing University Student Government of trying to castrate strong male voices into submission.

Bold.

Now, you might be wondering why Im dedicating this column to covering what some might consider a silly campus skirmish. But this is no silly skirmish.

Pew Research did a study a few months ago  revealing that 40 percent of millennials believe there should be limitations on free speech. Thats a disturbing number.

I suspect that our public universities are being used to foster such anti-American thinking. The Left isnt just opposing dissenting viewpoints. They are trying to silence opposing viewpoints.

Ellenhorn told me hes seen his fellow senators rant about all sorts of outrageous issues  but hes never tried to silence anyone. Hes never tried to have his opposition impeached.

Difference of opinion should be triumphed, he said. But what they are trying to do is shut difference of opinion down.

And they are in for a mighty big fight.

Im not going to stand down, he said. Im going to stand up. Im not going to be quiet.

Well said, Jacob! Thats exactly what you should do when faced with a leftwing bully. Stand your ground.

They are trying to silence me  and Im just going to get louder.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,'The Lucky Years': How to use medical breakthroughs now to live longer,[],"Advances in technology and personalized medicine are making it possible for people to live longer than ever. But how can we get the most out of those years?

Dr. Manny Alvarez, senior managing health editor of FoxNews.com, recently sat down with New York Times best-selling author and cancer specialist Dr. David Agus to find out how to do it with the tips in his new book The Lucky Years: How to Thrive in the Brave New World of Health.

Dr. Manny: Why did you write the book?

Dr. Agus: Its out of a sense of optimism. You know, theres been progress in our field, but all of a sudden, its literally happening week-by-week, theres a breakthrough thats changing everything. So I wanted to get people prepared and really have an optimistic view of whats happening now.

Were seeing so much negative on the health side, we have the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and its all about health care finance people forget the real conversation is the progress of health.

Dr. Manny: In your book, you make an emphasis of people need to take control of their own health.

Dr. Agus: No question about it, I mean, theres a lot of noise in our space and you know it. The reason you do what you do, the reason I do what I do is to help differentiate from the noise. And to really be a filter. So if you hear about a miracle cure-all for whatever, and youre not seeing it on your show, youre not seeing it in the New York Times, it probably isnt real. And I think thats one of the messages, but we all have to be in charge of our own health.

In todays world, the notion of going to see your doctor and at 2 oclock, he or she check your blood pressure and say Well, its up or its normal makes no sense. Go in with two months of data: In the morning when you get up, at night when you go to bed, when youre pissed off after a phone call. With enough data, error goes away. And with todays technologies, were going to change doctors offices so they dont come to collect data, draw blood and other things the datas collected at home and we actually do something which is remarkable, [which is] actually talk about data.

Dr. Manny: One of the things you mention [in your book] is [the ability to] edit your DNA. What is that about?

Dr. Agus: Last year and Im sure all of your viewers have seen this it was the molecule of the year in Science Magazine called CRISPR (Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), and this is the ability to surgically strike and change one of the 3 billion letters of DNA. It was used in China recently to change an embryo. Theyre using it now to make mosquitoes that are resistant to Zika (virus) for example, but it gives the potential of curing some of the genetic-linked diseases cystic fibrosis and others in a child whos suffering, you can actually fix it. We may be able to edit your T-cells, your immune cells, to be able to go and attack your own cancer. It really brings a new potential ... to really change things.

Dr. Manny: [Lets talk about] technology to control common ailments.

Dr. Agus: All kinds of things. I can, on my cellphone now, you know, literally put my hands here and get a high-resolution EKG (echocardiogram) on myself, and send it to my doctor. You know, we now can do things that we [only] dreamed of in other fields. President Carter, 92 years old, says, I have melanoma that went to the brain. Just two years ago, that was a death sentence. Now, he got a drug that every cancer has a dont eat me signal on its surface he got a drug that blocks that dont eat me signal, allowing his own immune system to control his cancer, and he announces last month that hes cancer free. And so this is really dramatic ... things are changing.

Dr. Manny: Something that affects me personally as an obstetrician [and that] you talk about [is] prolonged fertility. Thats a big-ticket item in todays patient population.

Dr. Agus: No doubt about it. And you know, there was an amazing study that came out that we can now take the nucleus of one womans egg and put that into a donor egg, and allow eggs to be much more fertile much longer ... And then all of a sudden somebody looked back, and there was a doctor in New Jersey whos been doing this for 20 years. [He] didnt get FDA approval, didnt go through any institutional review boards, hes just been doing it, and we dont know the outcome of these children, but it certainly brings new potential as society changes women want to have kids in their 30s, 40s and 50s and later this gives the potential for change.

Dr. Manny: Let me jump to something that is very important, especially to our viewership: detecting dementia decades before it happens.

Dr. Agus: What were learning is that you can start to pick up cues very easy that people are losing cognitive function. And at the same time, were learning from big-data studies how to prevent it.

A wild study came out of Europe showing that the closer you live to an airport, the higher the rate of neurocognitive decline or not thinking as well and what it means is that you need quiet at night. And so its as simple as that. I have a 150-pound dog that snores

I put those foam earplugs in and it gives my brain the quiet at night.

Theres also data that every year you delay retirement, you reduce the incidence of Alzheimers by 3 percent. So [if] you dont use it, you lose it. And so, all of us need to be aware of our cognitive function.

Theres a group at [University of California, San Francisco] that made a computer game that tried to connect various activities to connect parts of the brain and it worked. If an adult does that for an hour a day for a month, they actually increase cognitive function close to 20 percent for over a year. Theyre not going to sell the game in stores, theyre going through the FDA, so that you and I will write a prescription for this game to differentiate it from all these crazy websites that make claims without data.

Dr. Manny: ...Are we winning the war on cancer?

Dr. Agus: No, not even close. Were doing better ... but I have patients who die every week, and Im sure you do too, from this horrible disease.

So there are really two big advances that have happened in the last couple of years, and theyre big. Theyre not curing it, so were not winning, but they are prolonging [life] and decreasing some of the pain and suffering. One is what we call personalized medicine or molecularly targeted therapy. That is, in any cancer patient, I can, literally overnight, sequence the DNA of their cancer and this is paid for by insurance; this is commonly available now identify an on-switch and give them one of 30 or 40 pills that are on the market now, to turn off that on-switch. Many times we can have dramatic responses in patients.

In The Lucky Years book, we talk about a patient who [has] now [been living with the disease for] 4 or 5 years. And he had disease all over his body, and [now] hes still running a company, doing his normal life, taking a pill a day.

Dr. Manny: Your hope because I do believe youre never going to cure something that is a biological process in the human body but we certainly can make it into a chronic condition that we can sort of live with.

Dr. Agus: No question. Diabetes  people live a normal life with diabetes, and I want the same with cancer. We want to keep it under control. In my game, a tie is just as good as a win, right? If I can make it stop growing, Im on a good spot as a cancer doctor and so is the patient.

The plainclothes narcotics detective chose to stop Kevin Rojas' white Cadillac after seeing it driving erratically, Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Chief Tom Hackney said. Rojas had just threatened his girlfriend with a gun and fired shots in their house before taking off in his car.

""It was bad luck that the officer encounters him immediately after this,"" he said.

The detective, who is not being identified because he works undercover, was wearing a ""body armor"" style vest when he stopped Rojas' car, Hackney said. He was taking his son to school, then continuing on to work. The word ""police"" was marked clearly on the vest.

Rojas immediately opened fire, Hackney said, hitting the detective in the head, upper body and hand. Thedetective was in critical but stable condition and alert at a hospital.

The detective returned fire, but missed.

Rojas ran away from the shooting scene and stole a large flatbed truck from a nearby business, Hackney said.

The detective, whose 14-year-old son was in the car but unharmed, managed to call for help.

With the help of a bystander, officers located the truck and pursued it into a nearby neighborhood, where it crashed into a house. Rojas ran through the house to the back, and two officers found him holding a gun. They ordered him to drop it, Hackney said, and when he didn't, Rojas was shot four times. He survived and is still in the hospital.

The officers who fired the shots that struck Rojas are on administrative leave.

The gun used by Rojas was legally purchased by one of his roommates, who told police she bought it because of his erratic behavior in recent weeks, Hackney said. Police said he had a minor previous arrest record.

Rojas' mother Amy Wyss told detectives and WJXT-TV that her son was not a violent man.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Yellowstone bison sent to slaughter as park trims herd,[],"Yellowstone National Park started shipping many of its famous wild bison to slaughter Wednesday to drive down the size of the park's herds and respond to concerns by the livestock industry over a disease carried by the animals.

Thirty animals have been shipped to slaughterhouses, and officials plan to send an additional 120 in the next few days. The bison were weighed and tested for disease for research purposes, and the remaining animals were crowded into holding pens to await shipment.

The park's actions are driven by an agreement in 2000 with Montana officials that requires it to control its bison herds. The meat will be distributed to American Indian tribes that traditionally subsisted on bison.

""Nobody here wants to be doing this,"" park spokeswoman Jody Lyle said after the bison were prodded into trailers for shipment. ""It's time for a change.""

About 150 of the animals have been captured this winter trying to migrate out of the park in search of food at lower elevations in Montana. Ranchers worry about bison infected with brucellosis, a disease that can cause cattle to abort their young.

There have been no recorded bison-to-cattle transmissions of brucellosis, and critics say the slaughters are unnecessary. Captured bison that test negative for it are not spared.

""This is not OK. It's really that simple,"" said Stephany Seay with the Buffalo Field Campaign, a bison advocacy group.

Rick Lamplugh said he moved last May from Oregon to the small town of Gardiner, at the northern entrance to the park, in large part for the wildlife viewing opportunities. The park and state agencies need rethink their policies on bison so they can be ""treated like any other wildlife,"" he said.

Tens of millions of bison, also known as buffalo, once roamed North America. Commercial hunting drove the species to near-extinction in the late 1800s before conservationists  including former President Theodore Roosevelt  intervened when only dozens were left.

Yellowstone is home to one of the few remaining wild populations. Millions of tourists visit the park each year to see the animals, a top attraction at the nation's first national park. The animals also are the symbol of the National Park Service.

Since the 1980s, worry over brucellosis has prompted the killing of about 8,200 park bison, most of them sent to slaughter. In recent years, state, federal and tribal agencies have tried to emphasize public hunts that occur just outside the park's boundaries.

Hunters so far this winter have killed more than 400 of the animals, said Andrea Jones with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. That's the most since 1989. The vast majority were shot by members of American Indian tribes that have treaty hunting rights in the Yellowstone region.

Detracting from the hunt's success has been an unprecedented number of animals that were merely wounded and retreated to the park after being shot.

Up to 50 wounded bison were killed by state and federal wildlife agents, Jones said.

The park had 4,900 bison at last count, well above the 3,000 dictated under the agreement. Park officials set a goal this year of removing 600 to 900 of the animals. More shipments to slaughter are possible in coming weeks if large groups of bison move into Montana, although a mild winter has reduced this year's migration compared with previous years.

During the past decade, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and his predecessor moved to allow bison into areas adjacent to the park. Yellowstone administrators have supported those efforts, but they say they are bound under the 2000 agreement to keep the bison herds in check.

Alternatives  such as transferring some Yellowstone bison to lands outside the park  are under consideration but unlikely to take effect soon. Park workers are holding back from slaughter about two dozen bison calves for potential future placement elsewhere if the opportunity arises, park spokeswoman Amy Bartlett said.

If that doesn't happen, the animals will be slaughtered, she said.",[]

The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan said prosecutors found insufficient evidence to pursue federal charges in the 2012 death of Ramarley Graham and have officially concluded their investigation. The 18-year-old was shot in the bathroom of his Bronx home by an officer who had barged inside during a drug investigation. He was killed in front of his grandmother and 6-year-old brother.

In a statement Tuesday, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said his office conducted a thorough and independent investigation, but determined ""there is insufficient evidence to meet the high burden of proof required for a federal criminal civil rights prosecution.""

Prosecutors have said police first encountered Graham when they spotted him and two other people walking into a Bronx bodega in the afternoon of Feb. 2, 2012 and then immediately walking out. The officers, who were conducting a street narcotics investigation, said they saw Graham adjusting his waistband and told fellow officers they believed he had a gun. Police followed him to his Bronx home. An officer made his way into the home and forced his way into a bathroom and shot Graham once.

Richard Haste, the officer who shot Graham, said he fired his weapon because he thought he was going to be shot. No weapons were found in the apartment.

Haste was initially indicted in the Bronx on a state manslaughter charge, but a judge dismissed the case after determining that prosecutors improperly instructed grand jurors. A new grand jury declined to re-indict the officer.

After the shooting, Haste was stripped of his badge and gun and assigned to the department's fleet services division, officials said, but an internal disciplinary proceeding against him has been on hold pending the outcome of the federal investigation. In that time, Haste has received raises guaranteed by his union contract. A spokesman for the New York Police Department said Tuesday that Haste is currently on ""modified assignment.""

""He's gratified that the federal government has properly determined that there were no civil rights violations,"" Haste's attorney, Stuart London, said. ""There never were any winners in this case because there was a loss of life.""

Graham's family received a $3.9 million settlement from New York City.

Last month, Graham's parents and civil rights activists held an overnight protest at Bharara's office, sleeping on the concrete steps of the Manhattan office building, protesting what they believed was a lag in the investigation. They have also repeatedly sent letters to local and federal officials calling for Haste to be fired.

Graham's father, Frank Graham, told the New York Daily News that Tuesday's decision was ""heartbreaking"" and ""frustrating.""

""But we'll just move onto the next fight  which is firing the officers immediately,"" he said.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, who delivered the eulogy at Graham's funeral, said the decision to not pursue federal charges against the officer was ""very painful"" for Graham's family and the public.

The plainclothes narcotics detective chose to stop Kevin Rojas' white Cadillac after seeing it driving erratically, Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Chief Tom Hackney said. Rojas had just threatened his girlfriend with a gun and fired shots in their house before taking off in his car.

""It was bad luck that the officer encounters him immediately after this,"" he said.

The detective, who is not being identified because he works undercover, was wearing a ""body armor"" style vest when he stopped Rojas' car, Hackney said. He was taking his son to school, then continuing on to work. The word ""police"" was marked clearly on the vest.

Rojas immediately opened fire, Hackney said, hitting the detective in the head, upper body and hand. Thedetective was in critical but stable condition and alert at a hospital.

The detective returned fire, but missed.

Rojas ran away from the shooting scene and stole a large flatbed truck from a nearby business, Hackney said.

The detective, whose 14-year-old son was in the car but unharmed, managed to call for help.

With the help of a bystander, officers located the truck and pursued it into a nearby neighborhood, where it crashed into a house. Rojas ran through the house to the back, and two officers found him holding a gun. They ordered him to drop it, Hackney said, and when he didn't, Rojas was shot four times. He survived and is still in the hospital.

The officers who fired the shots that struck Rojas are on administrative leave.

The gun used by Rojas was legally purchased by one of his roommates, who told police she bought it because of his erratic behavior in recent weeks, Hackney said. Police said he had a minor previous arrest record.

Rojas' mother Amy Wyss told detectives and WJXT-TV that her son was not a violent man.

""This is not him,"" she said in a television interview. ""I'm sorry the officer was shot. From the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry.",[]

Ellenhorn is a student senator at USC and president of the College Republicans. He is also an outspoken conservative.

Click here to join Todds American Dispatch: a must-read for Conservatives!

And thats a big problem among his fellow student lawmakers at USC.

Ellenhorn is facing possible impeachment  accused of all sorts of tawdry behavior  like publicly expressing his conservative opinions and (brace yourself) inviting high-profile conservative speakers to campus.

It seems like freedom of speech and freedom to express your views is not allowed by the University of Southern California student government right now, he told me.

Ellenhorn accused liberal students of engaging in a witch hunt and committing institutionalized discrimination against me and my views.

If you voice a difference of opinion on any small issue  they lash out at you, he told me. Youre a racist, youre a homophobe, youre anti-woman, youre sexist. This is ridiculous.

The official complaint, first reported by Campus Reform, alleges that Ellenhorn created a hostile environments (sic) for our USC study body, and has also violated our USC Principles of Community by bringing a speaker and moderating an event that blatantly perpetuates sexism.

The Lefties were especially troubled when Ellenhorn invited Milo Yiannopoulos to speak last year.

PODCAST: Listen to Todds indepth interview with Jacob Ellenhorn

Stephen Smith, an adjunct professor and executive director of the USC Shoah Foundation, accused Yiannopoulos of being known for his anti-feminist and more broadly misogynist commentary.

Harmful speech has no place in the Trojan community, Smith wrote in a letter calling for Yiannopoulos to be disinvited.

Whatever Yiannopoulos has to say on campus, his invitation here calls into question the human values as well as the academic standards of the USC College republicans, he wrote. Controversial celebrity presenters may draw an audience, but the integrity of the USC College Republicans is rubbished by such content, the high standards of excellence we all try to uphold at USC are undermined, and the USC community as a whole is deeply offended on behalf of its women students, staff and faculty.

Ellenhorn admits that hes invited firebrand speakers like Yiannopoulos and Ben Shapiro.

They are claiming that because I invited them  I made students on campus feel unsafe, he said. No one has to listen to them. No one was forced to attend. For goodness sake  were adults. We should be able to handle other peoples opinions.

Senators are expected to hold hearings later this month to determine the young conservatives fate. But Ellenhorn doesnt seem to be all that intimidated.

He penned a fiery response to the complaint  accusing University Student Government of trying to castrate strong male voices into submission.

Bold.

Now, you might be wondering why Im dedicating this column to covering what some might consider a silly campus skirmish. But this is no silly skirmish.

Pew Research did a study a few months ago  revealing that 40 percent of millennials believe there should be limitations on free speech. Thats a disturbing number.

I suspect that our public universities are being used to foster such anti-American thinking. The Left isnt just opposing dissenting viewpoints. They are trying to silence opposing viewpoints.

Ellenhorn told me hes seen his fellow senators rant about all sorts of outrageous issues  but hes never tried to silence anyone. Hes never tried to have his opposition impeached.

Difference of opinion should be triumphed, he said. But what they are trying to do is shut difference of opinion down.

And they are in for a mighty big fight.

Im not going to stand down, he said. Im going to stand up. Im not going to be quiet.

Well said, Jacob! Thats exactly what you should do when faced with a leftwing bully. Stand your ground.

They are trying to silence me  and Im just going to get louder.

So, he has...that was a huge, huge thing that happened last night, Liasson, a National Public Radio national political correspondent, said.

The 7-pound-8-ounce infant remained hospitalized, but doctors said she appeared to be healthy. Police estimate she was hours old when she was found, Berry said.

James and Roseanne McCulloh said their son spotted a baby carrier on top of an irrigation box Tuesday morning while he was standing on the front porch. He then gently removed a metal panel that was on top of it.

""I saw him jump 20 feet, and he said 'There's a baby in it,' "" Roseanne McCulloh said. ""I ran over there. She wasn't blue. I touched her little arm, and I opened up the blanket. She was just beautiful.""

The girl was wrapped in a blanket, but there was nothing else in the carrier. The couple brought her inside and called 911. Roseanne McCulloh warmed up a blanket in the microwave while her husband wiped the baby down. Emergency responders showed up and transported the girl to the hospital.

Roseanne McCulloh said she believes the baby was left there around 2 a.m. She said her daughter recalls hearing noise from their irrigation box through her bedroom window around that time.

Michigan changed the stakes in Univision debate

Many had thought Hillary Clinton would be taking the stage in tonight's debate with solid back-to-back victories behind her, and her momentum going into next Tuesday's extremely important primaries as revved up as ever.

But no. This is, after all, the presidential election that defies many polls and predictions.

Clinton is going into this debate, which will air on Univision and CNN, still reeling from the biggest upset of the election cycle so far -- the loss in Michigan, a state the most recent polls had showed her leading rival Sen. Bernie Sanders by double digits. Instead, Sanders scored an upset victory, stunning both the Sanders and Clinton camps.

Now, Clinton needs a knock-out performance on Wednesday to take some of the shine off Sanders' Michigan upset, and Sanders himself needs a strong night to keep his Tuesday victory from seeming like a fluke.

Clinton remains in a strong position. She's half-way to having the delegates needed to be the Democratic nominee. Sanders said his Michigan triumph amounted to a public repudiation of establishment efforts to wrap up the primary and hand the nomination to Clinton.

""Last night our political revolution scored 'one of the greatest upsets in modern political history,' and we're seeing the same kind of come-from-behind momentum all across America,"" he wrote in a fund-raising letter to supporters, according to the Associated Press.

Clinton's campaign manager, Robby Mook, put the spotlight on Clinton's still commanding lead in Democratic delegates.

""We are confident we are nearing the point where our delegate lead will effectively become insurmountable,"" he said.

Meet the Univision moderators

Univisions star anchors, Jorge Ramos and Maria Elena Salinas, are moderating the Democratic debate, which begins at 9 p.m. .

Ramos, who emigrated from Mexico to the United States when he was in his 20s, himself frequently makes headlines for his activism, which he defends and says is a duty that does not compromise his professionalism.

At a Donald Trump event last year, Ramos famously yelled out questions, and did not stop despite warnings from the candidate. He was forcibly removed, but later returned, with Trump taking his questions.

In a New York Times interview this month, Ramos argued that a candidates views on immigration are important.

For us, immigration is not something abstract. It is personal. Very, very personal.

Salinas, who is of Mexican descent, is a co-host of Noticiero Univision and the prime-time show Here and Now.

They love us, they really love us

The Sanders and Clinton campaigns were lovin' Latinos on Wednesday, coincidentally (?) the day a debate between the candidates in Miami scheduled to air on Univision and CNN.

Indeed, Florida Latinos are getting a lot of attention this week as Democratic and Republican candidates woo them in the hope of boosting their chances for a win next Tuesday, when the state will hold its primary. The prize is a big one -- the winner takes all 99 delegates.

This time, immigration and other issues of special concern to the Latino community are sure to loom large. Florida is home to nearly 1.8 million Hispanics, including about 15 percent of the state's Democrats.

In advance of the debate, the two campaigns held rival conference calls, each side arguing that its candidate was strongest on Latino issues and that the other side's motivations are suspect.

""Hillary is the only one we can trust to lead 11 million people out of the shadows into the light,"" said Illinois Rep. Luis Guitterez, pointing to Sanders' vote against immigration reform legislation in 2007.

Sander's campaign played up his immigrant roots and pointed to Clinton's hesitation in 2007 on allowing people who were in the country illegally to obtain driver licenses.

""We've seen many troubling instances throughout the secretary's career where her relationship, her support for the Latino community has been one of convenience,"" said Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver.

The design flaws we all got used to are evident right away. When asked to turn on the computer, everyone hit the big button on the monitor and waited, something we all probably remember doing at some point. When the computer was turned on, the reactions kept coming.

""I don't think I've ever heard a computer make these sounds before in my life,"" said Morgan, age 19, making anyone who felt nostalgic upon hearing the floppy drive click instantly feel 10 years older.

Then the teens waited for the BIOS screen to go away.

""It seems more rough, the edges are more sharp, it's a little more impersonal,"" said Nora, age 18, who judging by that comment might have a future as a graphic designer.

But perhaps the hardest thing to understand for the teens was the lack of wireless connectivity.

""How do you get on the Internet if there's no Wi-Fi?"" asked Alicia, as though the question itself were nonsense.

When the produced tried to explain dial-up, things got even more confused.

Crews were responding to reports of a natural gas leak when the explosion occurred along a main thoroughfare north of downtown, Seattle Fire Department spokeswoman Corey Orvold said.

The cause was under investigation. There were no reports of any other injuries or anyone missing. Dogs were being used to go through the rubble just in case.

Video surveillance from the Olive and Grape Mediterranean Restaurant showed a bright flash at 1:43 a.m. and then the room shakes as debris falls from the ceiling. A large garage door covering the restaurant's front windows protected it from extensive damage.

""The Olive and Grape was lucky,"" owner Paola Kossack told The Associated Press in an email.

Bike shop owner Davey Oil said he arrived soon after the fire trucks.

""There were tons of flames leaping over what was already the rubble of Neptune coffee, which as you can see now totaled, gone,"" he said.

Crews were still dousing an active flame with foam as the Greenwood neighborhood awakened.

Residents were checking out the damage along with the rubble and glass that littered the streets. Workers from one cafe damaged in the blast poured coffee for firefighters.

Among the businesses damaged or destroyed were Neptune Coffee, Mr. Gyro and the bike shop G&O Family Cyclery. An apartment building and another nearby residential structure were evacuated.

""Our block is a pretty close-knit block and this is pretty terrible,"" Oil said.

Chocolati Cafe manager Darla Weidman said she was relieved the blast occurred overnight instead of 11 a.m. when the shop sometimes is packed with people.

""I know neighbors will do everything they can to support these businesses as they begin the long and challenging task to recover and repair from this incident,"" Seattle Mayor Ed Murray said in a statement. ""The city will also be there to do what we can.""

Puget Sound Energy spokeswoman Akiko Oda said gas service for the impacted buildings was shut off about an hour after the blast and the shutdown was later expanded.

The utility said it completed leak surveys for the block around the area and no leaks were found.

Oda says it will take time to determine what caused the explosion and the utility will be working with the Seattle Fire Department in the investigation.

Pipeline safety investigators from the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission were also on site.

Harborview Medical Center spokeswoman Susan Gregg said eight firefighters and a battalion chief were treated at the facility. None of the eight men and one woman was admitted to the hospital.

The Soyuz capsule carrying Kelly and his roommate for the past 340 days, Russian cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko, landed in the central Asian nation at around 10:25 a.m. local time (11:25 p.m. Tuesday EST). They were met by freezing temperatures, just like when they launched on March 27 of last year.

Kelly pumped his fist as he emerged from the capsule, then gave a thumbs up. He smiled and chatted with his doctors and others, as photographers crushed around him in the freezing cold.



""The air feels great out here,"" NASA spokesman at the scene, Rob Navias, quoted Kelly as saying. ""I have no idea why you guys are all bundled up.""



Clearly animated and looking well, Kelly said he didn't feel much different than he did after his five-month station mission five years ago.

And touchdown! Welcome home @StationCDRKelly, officially back on Earth after spending a #YearInSpace. pic.twitter.com/vmfGJfCRpA  NASA (@NASA) March 2, 2016

Following touchdown, the two yearlong spacemen were scheduled to undergo a series of medical tests. NASA wants to know the effects of a year in zero gravity on the body before committing to manned missions to Mars.

Kelly will then head to Houston with two flight surgeons and several other NASA reps, where he'll be reunited with his two daughters, ages 21 and 12; his girlfriend, a NASA public affairs representative at Johnson Space Center; and his brother and his wife, former Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.

My brother-in-law @StationCDRKelly is back on our planet! Excited to welcome him back in Houston tomorrow night! pic.twitter.com/hnjGDAsvM3  Gabrielle Giffords (@GabbyGiffords) March 2, 2016

Kelly spent 125 more days in space than the closest U.S. contender. In all, he and Kornienko traveled 144 million miles through space, circled the world 5,440 times and experienced 10,880 orbital sunrises and sunsets.

""A really smart person said to me one time, 'Teamwork makes the dreamwork in spaceflight,' and spaceflight is the biggest team sport there is,"" Kelly said Monday as he relinquished command of the space station. He acknowledged each of the 13 U.S., Russian, European and Japanese space fliers with whom he and Kornienko lived during the past year. ""It's incredibly important that we all work together to make what is seemingly impossible, possible.""

For NASA, that mission possible is Mars.

Scientists are hoping for more one-year subjects as NASA gears up for human expeditions to Mars in the 2030s. Radiation will be a top challenge, along with the body and mind's durability on what will be a 212-year journey round trip.

The choice of the pioneering Kelly turned out to be a bonanza. His identical twin, retired astronaut Mark Kelly, offered himself up as a medical guinea pig so researchers could study the differences between the genetic doubles, one in space and the other on the ground. They provided blood, saliva and urine samples, underwent ultrasounds and bone scans, got flu shots and more, all in the name of science.

Kelly has spent more time in space, altogether, than any other American: 520 days over the course of four missions. Realizing this is likely his last journey, it was ""a little bittersweet"" saying goodbye to his orbiting home. He'll have plenty of pictures, at least, for the scrapbook  he posted 1,000 dramatic, color-drenched pictures of Earth on his Twitter and Instagram accounts.

Sanders now says, look I'm winning in the states that are actually battleground states in the fall, she's winning in red states that don't really matter, you know, in the general election. So, he has...that was a huge, huge thing that happened last night, Liasson, a National Public Radio national political correspondent, said.

Sanders pulled off an upset in Michigan, winning by a slim margin, 49.8 percent to Clintons 48.3 percent.

Liasson noted that was not expected, wasn't even expected by Bernie Sanders, he looked as stunned as anybody else did, adding that Sanders victory in a state like Michigan could have much larger implications for Clinton later on, should she secure the nomination.

""He won in a state where the Democratic primary electorate resembles the national electorate much more than in South Carolina or Mississippi,"" Liasson said, pointing to two of Clinton's recent victories.

And the question this raises is, if she can get beat by a Democratic populist in Michigan in March, why can't she get beat by a Republican populist in Michigan in November?""",[]

""At this point, our detectives have kind of exhausted all of our initial possible leads that we had,"" Mesa police spokesman Steve Berry said at a news conference. ""We have had no success in locating either Mom or Dad for this child.""

The 7-pound-8-ounce infant remained hospitalized, but doctors said she appeared to be healthy. Police estimate she was hours old when she was found, Berry said.

James and Roseanne McCulloh said their son spotted a baby carrier on top of an irrigation box Tuesday morning while he was standing on the front porch. He then gently removed a metal panel that was on top of it.

""I saw him jump 20 feet, and he said 'There's a baby in it,' "" Roseanne McCulloh said. ""I ran over there. She wasn't blue. I touched her little arm, and I opened up the blanket. She was just beautiful.""

The girl was wrapped in a blanket, but there was nothing else in the carrier. The couple brought her inside and called 911. Roseanne McCulloh warmed up a blanket in the microwave while her husband wiped the baby down. Emergency responders showed up and transported the girl to the hospital.

Roseanne McCulloh said she believes the baby was left there around 2 a.m. She said her daughter recalls hearing noise from their irrigation box through her bedroom window around that time.

Mesa police are asking anyone who may have been in the area Tuesday morning to come forward, Berry said. Investigators want to speak with anyone who remembers seeing a woman or a vehicle or anything suspicious. As of Wednesday afternoon, police hadn't received any calls with possible new leads since holding the news conference.

Investigators do not believe the mother gave birth at any hospital. Berry said no medical facility would have let an infant leave with ""a full umbilical cord attached.""

Arizona has a Safe Haven Law that allows a person to leave a newborn at certain locations such as fire stations, hospitals and churches without fear of criminal prosecution. Police are wondering why the parents essentially left the baby on the sidewalk when there is a fire station about half a mile away, Berry said.

""Fortunately, the homeowner did happen to come out to the house and discovered the baby,"" he said.

The infant, who police are calling ""Baby Jane,"" is described as either Hispanic or Native American with black hair.

If nobody claims the baby, she will be put into the custody of the Arizona Department of Child Safety and likely placed in a foster home.",[]

The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan said prosecutors found insufficient evidence to pursue federal charges in the 2012 death of Ramarley Graham and have officially concluded their investigation. The 18-year-old was shot in the bathroom of his Bronx home by an officer who had barged inside during a drug investigation. He was killed in front of his grandmother and 6-year-old brother.

In a statement Tuesday, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said his office conducted a thorough and independent investigation, but determined ""there is insufficient evidence to meet the high burden of proof required for a federal criminal civil rights prosecution.""

Prosecutors have said police first encountered Graham when they spotted him and two other people walking into a Bronx bodega in the afternoon of Feb. 2, 2012 and then immediately walking out. The officers, who were conducting a street narcotics investigation, said they saw Graham adjusting his waistband and told fellow officers they believed he had a gun. Police followed him to his Bronx home. An officer made his way into the home and forced his way into a bathroom and shot Graham once.

Richard Haste, the officer who shot Graham, said he fired his weapon because he thought he was going to be shot. No weapons were found in the apartment.

Haste was initially indicted in the Bronx on a state manslaughter charge, but a judge dismissed the case after determining that prosecutors improperly instructed grand jurors. A new grand jury declined to re-indict the officer.

After the shooting, Haste was stripped of his badge and gun and assigned to the department's fleet services division, officials said, but an internal disciplinary proceeding against him has been on hold pending the outcome of the federal investigation. In that time, Haste has received raises guaranteed by his union contract. A spokesman for the New York Police Department said Tuesday that Haste is currently on ""modified assignment.""

""He's gratified that the federal government has properly determined that there were no civil rights violations,"" Haste's attorney, Stuart London, said. ""There never were any winners in this case because there was a loss of life.""

Graham's family received a $3.9 million settlement from New York City.

Last month, Graham's parents and civil rights activists held an overnight protest at Bharara's office, sleeping on the concrete steps of the Manhattan office building, protesting what they believed was a lag in the investigation. They have also repeatedly sent letters to local and federal officials calling for Haste to be fired.

Graham's father, Frank Graham, told the New York Daily News that Tuesday's decision was ""heartbreaking"" and ""frustrating.""

""But we'll just move onto the next fight  which is firing the officers immediately,"" he said.

The Rev. Al Sharpton, who delivered the eulogy at Graham's funeral, said the decision to not pursue federal charges against the officer was ""very painful"" for Graham's family and the public.

Graham's death has been cited during numerous demonstrations after grand juries in Missouri and New York declined to indict police officers in the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner on Staten Island. The deaths fueled a national conversation about policing and race. A federal grand jury is currently hearing evidence in Garner's case.",[]

Responding to a question on the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association's website, the 97-year-old religious leader said Christians must be completely dedicated and involved in their faith.

Graham explains in the BGEA ""My Answers"" post that while many are be tempted to stop attending church so they can focus on other weekend activities, such an approach to Christianity and Christ's love is not sustainable in the long run.

""People drop out of church for all sorts of reasons (and over the years I suppose I've heard them all!),"" the reverend begins, suggesting that some people have good reasons to leave their church, including if their pastor isn't preaching the Gospel.

Many times, however, people drop out of church simply because ""they want to do something else.""

""Perhaps they've found church boring, or people haven't seemed friendly, or it's become a meaningless routine. But these aren't true of every church  and often they're only an excuse to do something else,"" the religious leader says, adding that this age-old problem can be traced back to the New Testament, as seen in Hebrews 10:25, when some believers ""give up"" meeting together.

""In some severely disabled people, even blinking is not possible,"" Dr. Miguel Nicolelis, co-director of the Duke Center for Neuroengineering, said in a statement. ""For them, using a wheelchair or device controlled by noninvasive measures like an EEG [electroencephalogram]  a device that monitors brain waves through electrodes on the scalp  may not be sufficient. We show clearly that if you have intracranial implants, you get better control of a wheelchair than with noninvasive devices."" [See video of a monkey moving a wheelchair with its brain]

Brain machine interface

The new experiment isn't the first time that scientists have created a so-called brain-machine interface. In a 2009 study, researchers showed that people with electrodes implanted in their brains could type with just their thoughts. In 2012, a quadriplegic used thoughts to move a robotic arm. And in 2013, Nicolelis and his colleagues showed that monkeys could move robotic arms with their minds.

To expand upon their earlier work, Nicolelis and his colleagues implanted hundreds of tiny electrodes into the premotor cortex, which helps plan movement, and the somatosensory cortex, which helps process the sense of touch, of two monkeys. They then trained the monkeys to use their brain waves to navigate the wheelchair toward a bowl of tasty grapes. Nicolelis and his colleagues then recorded their brain waves from 300 brain cells, or neurons, during this process. The scientists translated those brain waves into commands for a motorized wheelchair. [Image Gallery: The Incredible Bionic Man]

Over time, the monkeys got better at the task, navigating towards the bowl of grapes more quickly and with fewer wrong turns, the researchers reported online March 3 in the journal Scientific Reports.

The team found that the monkeys were not only producing brain signals associated with translation and rotation, but they were also evaluating the distance between the bowl of fruit and the chair.

""This was not a signal that was present in the beginning of the training, but something that emerged as an effect of the monkeys becoming proficient in this task,"" Nicolelis said in a statement. ""This was a surprise. It demonstrates the brain's enormous flexibility to assimilate a device, in this case a wheelchair, and that device's spatial relationships to the surrounding world.""

In follow-up work, Nicolelis and his colleagues want to expand their neuronal recording to a greater number of brain regions, in order to improve the brain-computer interface.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Thank you, America, for playing 'Celebrity Apprentice' GOP edition",['Wayne Allyn Root'],"It all began with 17 contestants. Almost all of them celebrities in the world of politics. Only one had no chance to win -- according to the experts. He was thought of as a clown, politically incorrect, offensive, and had zero political experience at any level. Ninety-nine percent of the experts predicted hed never even file his financials with the FEC.

Surprise. Meet the winner of ""Celebrity Apprentice Special Political Edition"": Donald J. Trump.

As of Tuesday night Trump added Mississippi, Michigan and Hawaii to his trophy case. It wasnt even close. Trump dominated. And hes leading by a mile in the two remaining jewels needed to put this race away.

Trump leads Florida by a landslide over Florida Senator Marco Rubio. He has a commanding lead in Ohio over Ohio Governor Kasich.

How could the national media, political experts and commentators get it so wrong? The guy who never ran for office, let alone served in office, just beat out a mob of Washington insiders whove played the political game their entire lives.

Its almost as if Trump was toying with the entire political process. Its almost like it was a big game to him. It was almost as if he thought he was smarter than everyone else and he could play the game at a higher level. Almost.

Trump was the guy who supposedly only knew how to win a national television reality competition called Celebrity Apprentice. Heck, he designed the game. He produced the game. He sat in the boardroom and analyzed the tactics of the participants of the game. He crowned the winner among a mob of candidates each time.

Is it possible that Celebrity Apprentice was the perfect preparation for a presidential run? Is it possible Trump is smarter than all of us? Did he figure out that politics is exactly like a TV reality show competition? Did he design the perfect winning strategy based on Celebrity Apprentice?

Think about it. This political reality competition started with 17 contestants, a veritable Whos Who of national politics:

* 9 governors or former governors, including the Chairman of the Republican Governors Association: Chris Christie of New Jersey, John Kasich of Ohio, Jeb Bush of Florida, Jim Gilmore of Virginia, Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, George Pataki of New York, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Rick Perry of Texas.

* 5 Washington, D.C. U.S. Senate celebrities: United States Senators: Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Rick Santorum and Lindsey Graham.

*And three miscellaneous celebrities -- billionaire businessman Donald Trump; world-renowned brain surgeon and best-selling author Dr. Ben Carson; and businesswoman and CEO Carly Fiorina, a former CEO of Hewlett Packard and U.S. Senate candidate in California.

Today 16 contestants have gone dark. There is only one man left standing. There is no serious path to victory for anyone but Donald J. Trump -- the man who had never before played the Washington political game. The man who had never before run for office. The man who had never served a day in office. The man who ran his campaign without pollsters, strategists or consultants.

Experts called him crazy and extreme and unelectable.

Former GOP Presidential nominee Mitt Romney called him a fraud and conman.

Polls found he had the highest negatives of any candidate in modern political history.

Through it all he spent almost nothing. He ran the entire campaign on free media and his skills as the world's greatest branding expert.

And hes the one left standing. Hes the victor. Not by an inch. By a mile. Trump dominated.

Maybe its time to admit Trump is no dummy. Maybe Trump knew exactly what he was doing from day one. Maybe hes smarter than all the political experts in the media. Maybe hes smarter than all the political strategists and consultants in Washington D.C. Maybe hes smarter than all the politicians. Maybe he's just playing at a higher level than the rest of us.

Maybe he devised the perfect plan to win the ultimate grueling reality show competition- the race for President of the United States.

Its time to face the fact: Donald Trump will be the 2016 GOP presidential nominee. I hope Hillary Clinton is ready to play Celebrity Apprentice.

My prediction: Hillary doesnt have the skills to compete in this game.

Possibly the biggest star of Wednesday nights Democratic debate in Florida was not one of the two candidates on stage.

Instead, it was a middle-aged Guatemalan immigrant who asked the Democratic presidential hopefuls one of the toughest and most emotional questions of the evening.

While the candidates were taking questions from the audience, Lucia Quiej, an undocumented immigrant whose husband was deported in 2011 because of an expired driver's license, asked the candidates in Spanish: ""What will you do to stop deportations and reunite families?""

Quiejs husband, Andres Jimenez, was denied political asylum in the U.S. and was forced to leave his wife as the only breadwinner in the five-children family. All six members of the family, who live in Homestead, Florida, attended the debate.

I was one month pregnant and they deported him only because he didnt have a drivers license, Quiej told Progreso Weekly in 2014. Theres a lot of people here with ankle monitors, many children whose parents were taken away by Immigration. In Homestead, theres nothing; only despair.

Speaking before the debate, Quiej and her family said that they live in a constant state of fear that they or somebody they know will be picked up by immigration officials and deported. The morning of the debate, Quiej said that she received a text from a friend that immigration agents were in her town.

""Homestead is becoming a ghost town, sold Univision. We all struggle with fear.""

Quiejs question during the debate was praised by the crowd and social media, and both candidates applauded her courage.

""It is time to bring families together. More Americans need to know the human cost of these policies are,"" said Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

She added: ""I will do everything I can to prevent other families to face what you are facing.

The essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families, said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. The idea that a mother is living here and her children are on the other side of the border is wrong and immoral.

He added: That is beyond comprehension and policies that should not be allowed to exist.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Aaaaaaah, really? You would die if you didn't sigh",[],"How many times per day do you sigh? Chances are, the number in your head is off by a factor of about 10, according to a new study.

People actually sigh about 12 times every hour, or once every five minutes, researchers found. But these audible exhalations don't necessarily signal tiredness or exasperation. Rather, physiological sighs are vital to keeping the lungs functioning properly, the scientists said.

Now, researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and Stanford University have identified the source of sighing, which they classify as a life-sustaining reflex that prevents air sacs located in the lungs, called alveoli, from collapsing. [15 Weird Things Humans Do Every Day, and Why]

""A human lung has as much surface area as a tennis court, and so that's all folded inside your chest,"" study co-author Jack Feldman, a professor of neurobiology at UCLA, told Live Science. ""The way that nature did it is that there's 500 million little air sacs called alveoli. And each alveolus is a little sphere, about 0.2 millimeters [0.008 inches] in diameter.""

These tiny, round sacs help ensure that sufficient amounts of oxygen can pass easily into the blood through the lung membranes, and Feldman described them as being similar to ""wet balloons.""

""Did you ever try blowing up a wet balloon? It's very difficult, because the water on the inside sticks together,"" he said. ""This is what happens when an alveolus collapses ... and whenever they collapse, that surface area gets taken out of the ability to exchange gas.""

In other words, if humans weren't able to sigh, the alveoli wouldn't be able to reinflate, and the lungs would fail. Feldman said the only way to pop alveoli open again is to take a deep breath, which humans tend to do every 5 minutes.

""In the early days of using mechanical ventilation like iron lungs, people were inflated just with normal lung volumes, and a lot of them died because their alveoli collapsed,"" Feldman said. ""Now, when you see someone getting respiratory therapy on a ventilator, you'll notice that every couple of minutes, there's a huge breath that is superimposed, and that is playing the role of a sigh.""

So, a sigh is like a double breath, Feldman said, and it doesn't necessarily have to be a loud exhale like you might do when you're huffing or expressing relief. [Gasp! 11 Surprising Facts About the Respiratory System]

However, Feldman said that sighs are actually associated with emotions in a different way, because sigh rates tend to go up when someone is stressed. One of the things that happen to a body under stress is that the brain releases molecules known as peptides, which are protein subunits. Some of these are called bombesin-related peptides.

Bombesin isn't present in mammals, the researchers said, and is actually a toxin found in the skin of a European fire-bellied toad. However, mammals have receptors for it, and previous research found that peptides called neuromedin B (NMB) and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) are the equivalent in mammals, including humans.

Feldman's own previous research identified that injecting bombesin into an area of the brain called the pre-Botzinger complex increased the sigh rate of rats from 25 times an hour to about 400, while their breathing rate stayed more or less the same.

In comparison, when a special toxin that can kill cells that express the receptor for bombesin was injected into the same area, the animals stopped sighing altogether but continued to breathe normally otherwise, the researchers said.

In the new study, Feldman collaborated with Mark Krasnow, a professor of biochemistry at Stanford University, and his research team. Krasnow had been supervising a Stanford student named Kevin Yackle, who was inspired by a talk Feldman gave about how the brain controls breathing. Yackle went to Krasnow with his idea to go through an online database of 14,000 molecules of the brain and use it as a way of trying to piece together how the nervous system works.

Krasnow and his team were keen to collaborate with Feldman when they realized that he had been simultaneously researching bombesin-related peptides. The Stanford team had identified two molecules, NMB and GRP, that were highly concentrated in regions of the brain that are important for breathing but are found almost nowhere else in the brain. At the time, the researchers didn't know what these molecules were for, but by teaming up with Feldman, the scientists were able to analyze around 14,000 gene expression patterns in the brain cells of mice. They identify around 200 neurons in the mouse brain stem that are responsible for producing and releasing bombesinlike peptides.

""We identified about 400 neurons [in] total that were key for triggering sighs,"" Feldman said. ""That's not a lot of neurons to be involved in a fundamental behavior.""

The researchers think their findings could offer insight into other parts of the nervous system and into the mechanisms that may underlie more complex behaviors in humans.

But when it comes to researching the nervous system, it can be a bit like learning a language, Feldman said.

""It's a little bit like saying, 'If you want to understand the English language, do you start with Shakespeare, or [do] you start with Dr. Seuss?"" he said. ""The vocabulary is simpler, the number of words [is] simpler, but there are a lot of fundamental principles involved in Dr. Seuss that are going to tell us a lot about Shakespeare.""

And when it comes to learning Shakespeare, ""we have to increase the vocabulary, the sophistication ... but it builds on a foundation,"" he added.

The research could have potential applications for the development of medicine to treat certain conditions, the researchers said. With some anxiety disorders, for instance, people may sigh too much, which can be debilitating. And some people don't sigh enough, which can lead to breathing problems and compromised lung function, the scientists said.

Feldman said he wants to do further research on what individual neurons are doing when a person sighs, and he is interested in breaking down how these neurons are organized.

""An immediate question is, when you apply these peptides in normal inspiratory, bursts become a sigh; a double burst,"" he said. ""Why? What's happening to the neurons? What's happening to the circuit? You don't know. That's a fundamentally important question, not just for sighs but for understanding how the nervous system is transforming information and processing signals.""

The research was published online Feb. 8 in the journal Nature.

Officials on Thursday released the names of the victims: Tina Shelton, 37; Jerry Shelton, 35; Brittany Powell, 27; Chanetta Powell, 25; and Shada Mahone, 26.

The shooting unfolded late Wednesday at a house on Franklin Avenue in Wilkinsburg, just east of downtown Pittsburgh. Four people were killed on the home's back porch, Allegheny County Lt. Andrew Schurman said. A fifth person died from her injuries at a local hospital.

Allegheny County police said two injured men were in critical condition early Thursday, while a woman was in stable condition.

Schurman described the gathering at the home as ""a backyard party or cookout of some sort"", but did not elaborate further. He said gunshots came from two distinct locations but police don't believe anyone at the party fired back.



""It looks like right now they were all fleeing toward the back door of the residence when the second gunman fired from the side of the yard,"" he said. ""They all seemed to get caught on the back porch.""



It wasn't clear why the gunmen may have opened fire.

Wilkinsburg is a poorer, largely blighted suburb known for drug trafficking and gun violence. But, neighbors described the street on which the shooting occurred as generally quiet and expressed shock. They said they heard between 20 and 25 gunshots.

""It went on for almost a minute,"" James Boyd told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ""I thought it was maybe the pipes bursting. But then we realized it was gunshots. We've had trouble in this neighborhood before but never this close to home.""

An unidentified woman who said she lived one house away from the shooting scene told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that her neighbors had a cookout earlier in the day and were still in their backyard when the shots rang out.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"After Trump endorsement, NASCAR leader faces the fallout",[],"When Brian France endorsed Donald Trump for president, the chairman and chief executive of NASCAR thought of it as nothing more than a ""routine endorsement.""

He's been dealing with the fallout ever since.

France's decision to personally back the front-runner for the Republican nomination has roiled a sport his family built from the ground up. It's threatened a decade of work to broaden NASCAR's appeal among minorities, upset one of the most powerful teams in the sport and risked a break with the corporate sponsors that are its financial lifeblood.

""I was frankly, very surprised, that my diversity efforts for my whole career would have been called into question, over this, in my view, a routine endorsement,"" France said Wednesday in an interview with The Associated Press.

France acknowledged he's had to have conversations with sponsors since making the endorsement, which came as NASCAR is seeking a new main sponsor for its top series.

""I made a few phone calls and clarified some things,"" he said. ""That kind of goes with the territory.""

France's appearance at a Trump rally the day before last week's Super Tuesday elections fits with the sport's history of occasionally blending politics with the action at the track. France's grandfather, NASCAR founder Bill France Sr., endorsed George Wallace for president. Its all-time winningest driver, Richard Petty, celebrated his 200th victory with President Ronald Reagan and ran for statewide office in North Carolina in the 1990s.

France told the AP on Wednesday he backed Barack Obama in 2008 and actively participated in the campaign, shifting his support to Mitt Romney four years later.

""I supported Obama. I went to his rallies. I parted with my hard-earned money. There was a movement going on, and I was really thrilled with the idea of the first African-American president,"" he said. ""I did the same for Mitt Romney. In both of those cases, I have never agreed with all of their policies.""

But Trump is a candidate unlike any other in recent memory, drawing intense criticism for the racial undertones of his rhetoric and policies. The billionaire has called immigrants from Mexico rapists and drug dealers, has vowed to forcibly deport the 11 million people living in the country illegally and seeks to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the U.S.

Trump has also earned the explicit or implicit backing of a slew of white nationalist leaders, including former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has compared his language to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.

It's into that cauldron that France inserted himself and his sport -- admittedly without knowing all of what Trump has proposed. ""I don't even know all their policies, truthfully,"" France said. He said he likes Trump's ""business approach"" and his status as a Washington outsider. He also cited the electricity around the Trump campaign and a friendship with one of Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr., that dates back nearly two decades.

""I'm not supporting him for all of his views, or his immigration views,"" France said. ""I happen to be very enamored by the excitement he's brought and the voter turnout that it is creating.""

France also is trying to protect his record on diversity. He said NASCAR has spent ""tens of millions of dollars"" on a program aimed at boosting the participation of minorities in the sport. That program includes Japanese-American driver Kyle Larson, who competes in the top-level Sprint Cup, and Darrell Wallace Jr., a driver in the second-tier Xfinity Series who is black and who came up through NASCAR's diversity program.

France's efforts to quell criticism over what he insists was a ""personal and private"" decision have also been complicated by Trump's continued mentioning of how he's received ""NASCAR's endorsement.""

On Monday, at a North Carolina campaign rally not far from Charlotte Motor Speedway and the headquarters of many top NASCAR teams, Trump was ebullient in describing his backing from the sport. ""You know, I just had a visitor backstage. NASCAR endorsed Trump, can you believe that?"" he asked the crowd.

Except it wasn't NASCAR that made the endorsement. It was France.

""We talked to the campaign about the endorsement that I made, versus the sport, and it's hard to get that perfectly right all the time,"" France said.

Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump's campaign, said in a statement that he spoke broadly because the ""endorsement is from the great Brian France, in addition to several NASCAR drivers.""

In a company-wide email sent last week to all his employees, France reiterated that NASCAR has never had a policy prohibiting employees or competitors from participating in politics, but said that could change in the future.

He told the AP on Wednesday he understands that his endorsement can be viewed as one that comes from NASCAR itself.

""I understand that the family is closely linked with NASCAR. ... We've just always, you've seen politicians come to tracks, and it varies, some Democrats, some are Republicans, all have policies we do and don't agree with,"" he said.",[]

Here's a sampling of the amazing solar eclipse snapshots we found in our mail today.

NASA tracked the solar eclipse from Micronesia, capturing stunning video of the moon blocking the sun, and many other eclipse-chasers also had their cameras ready for the event. One veteran astrophotographer, Justin Ng of Singapore, put together an awesome collage of eclipse phases (below) from photographs he took in Palu, Indonesia, while leading a team of eight first-time eclipse photographers. It was Ng's first time as well, and the eclipse proved challenging compared to his usual night-sky targets. But the experience, he said, was unforgettable.

""Moments before the totality, I could feel the drastic change in temperature (it became cooler), and my guess would be at least a 5-7 degree Celsius [9 to 13 degrees F] difference,"" Ng said in an email. ""During the totality, the scene turned darker, and I was able to see the sun's corona with my eyes! It's akin to seeing a 'black hole' in the sky, and everything was so surreal and unbelievable."" Plus, Ng was able to spot Venus and Mercury during totality. [See more photos of the 2016 total solar eclipse]

Matt Skinner wasn't in a location to see the total solar eclipse, but he managed to document the partial solar eclipse visible from Anchorage, Alaska. He was a first-time eclipse photographer as well, and it was actually the first time he managed to see an eclipse clearly at all.

""The clouds were thick throughout much of Anchorage, but I was lucky enough to find a spot where the sun showed itself for about 20 minutes or so,"" Skinner told Space.com in an email. ""The mountains and the light refracting off of the water were bonuses for me, as I had only intended to capture the eclipse.""

After his first eclipse experience, he's ready for more  particularly, the U.S.-spanning total solar eclipse coming up in August 2017, he said.

Akash Anandh snagged this shot with a telephoto lens on his camera, and also photographed the eclipse through a telescope that was available for viewing at the National University of Singapore, he told Space.com.

Vincent Tan (darthcryder) ran across the solar eclipse while on a photo walk with a friend, unexpectedly catching this beautiful view of an airplane in silhouette.

And Ben Ali Tolentino caught this view of the eclipse in projection from the Philippines.

NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center invited everyone to submit photos of the eclipse on Flickr, and highlighted some additional spectacular views.

Most of the United States missed a glimpse of this eclipse, but American readers can get ready to flex their astrophotography muscles next year, when a total solar eclipse will cross the United States and offer full or partial views nationwide.

Speaking with Sean Hannity on a special Fox News town hall, Trump accused GOP lawmakers opposed to his campaign of ""taking advantage of our country.""



The billionaire businessman called his campaign a movement ""of competence and common sense and low taxes and [secure] borders and it would be so foolish to give it away.""

Trump was referring to a conference held by the conservative American Enterprise Institute at Sea Island off the coast of Georgia over the weekend, where one of the topics reportedly was stopping Trump from securing the Republican nomination.

The conference reportedly was attended by Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other key Republican congressmen.

""I know all these people,"" Trump told Hannity. ""These are people that are taking advantage of our country. They dont want to have strong borders. They want stuff flowing across the borders. They dont want to have taxation when countries treat us unfairly because they benefit from that.""

""Politicians will do whats right for the people that gave them the money,"" Trump added later, ""not what's right for the country.""

Former GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush also planned to meet with Trump's rivals on Thursday ahead of a GOP debate in Florida, fueling speculation that he's preparing to endorse a candidate challenging Trump.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, meanwhile, told Fox News that he would not drop out of the Republican presidential race before next week's Florida primary, saying, ""we're gonna fight this thing through Tuesday ... and we're going to go on.""

Rubio denied multiple reports that he had discussed the possibility of dropping out before the winner-take-all contest.

Speaking with Fox News Megyn Kelly, Rubio said: ""I have never discussed dropping out with anyone on my team, or anyone on the planet Earth ... I'm the only one who can beat Donald Trump in Florida.

A Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Rubio trailing Trump by 23 percentage points among likely Republican voters in Florida.

""I honestly dont believe Donald Trump will be the nominee,"" Rubio said. ""I continue to believe it's going to be me, and it's got to start here in Florida.""

Rubio also dismissed the possibility that he would form a so-called ""unity"" Republican ticket with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump's closest challenger in the delegate race, calling it "" the kind of drama that makes it interesting in TV to speculate about.""

""At some point we're all going to team up,"" Rubio said in reference to the non-Trump candidates. ""We're all going to be on the same team, I hope.

Cruz told Kelly that Rubio and Kasich were ""good, honorable people, but neither of them has a path to the nomination.""

""Head-to-head, not only do I beat Donald Trump,"" Cruz said, ""but I defeat him resoundingly.""

Cruz also walked back his earlier opposition to a possible convention fight between himself and Trump if neither man reaches the required 1,237 delegates during the primaries.

""Look, [Ronald] Reagan and [President Gerald] Ford battled it out at a contested convention [in 1976],"" Cruz said. ""That's what conventions are for."" However, Cruz restated his opposition to a so-called brokered convention, calling it ""a fever dream of the D.C. establishment"" and warning of ""an open revolt"" among Republican voters if it came to pass.

Cruz later turned his rhetorical fire against Trump and Rubio over immigration reform and the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" bill in 2013.

""When Marco Rubio stood with Barack Obama and [Sen.] Chuck Schumer and [then-Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid ... I stood with millions of Americans,"" Cruz told Kelly. ""Not only was Donald Trump nowhere to be found, he was funding the Gang of Eight. He gave $50,000 to five of its members.""

Cruz also accused Rubio of lowering the tone of the campaign, saying, ""I have no views whatsoever on any part of Donald Trumps anatomy,"" an apparent reference to Rubio jabbing Trump's ""small hands"" at a Virginia campaign stop.

For his part, Rubio told Megyn Kelly that he regretted the remark, saying ""my kids were embarrassed by it, my wife didnt like it, I dont think it reflects [well]; thats not who I am.""

Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has staked his campaign's future on victory in next Tuesday's Ohio primary, told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren that he would ""probably not"" pick up enough delegates in other contests to overtake Trump, but noted that voters had only ""picked about half the delegates [so far] this year ... anything is possible.""

A Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Kasich leading Trump by five percentage points among likely Republican voters in the Buckeye State.

""We're going to win Ohio,"" Kasich told Van Susteren. ""That's not even a question for me. It's about what we do after that and all the places we have to go. But we're not taking it for granted.""

Trump has 458 delegates to Cruz's 359 following Tuesday's contests, in which Trump won the Mississippi and Michigan primaries as well as the Hawaii caucus. Cruz also picked up a win in the Idaho primary. Rubio is a distant third with 151 delegates, while Kasich has 54.",[]

Ricardo DeAratanha, 65, was arrested after Simi Valley police responded to a report of a suspicious vehicle about three-quarters of a mile downhill from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.

Deputy Chief David Livingstone said DeAratanha refused to identify himself and balked at providing further identification, and was arrested for resisting and obstructing officers.

However, DeAratanhas attorney Mark Werksman told the Los Angeles Times that his client provided multiple unassailable press credentials and the officers kept asking him for more ID. DeAratanha has been with the newspaper since 1989.

The attorney says the officers grew angry when DeAratanha suggested that his Brazilian ethnicity and tan skin was behind their questioning of him.

Livingstone, the deputy chief, denied that race had anything to do with the encounter.

This is not something we want to happen, Livingstone said. Had he cooperated, we wouldve had a different outcome.

DeAratanha was cited and released. He was treated at a local hospital for a sprained elbow.

The Ventura County district attorneys office has 30 days to decide whether to press charges. The photographers arraignment is scheduled for April 7, according to the Los Angeles Times.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,How to answer your body's food cravings,[],"Food cravings arent just a silly thing pregnant women deal with for 40 weeks, we all feel the urge to eat foods that may not serve our health and weight goals.

While some cravings are the results of gut bacterial overgrowth, many are really an SOS message of malnutrition from your body.

Most of our food is grown in depleted, over-farmed soil, which lacks the minerals and nutrients it once contained before large scale agriculture. In a 2013 update of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2010), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that our average intake of important nutrients like potassium, calcium, and magnesium is so low, that it declared the issue a widespread public health issue.

Yet, we eat more food and calories than ever before, and also have an obesity epidemic that grows steadily each year. What gives?

Most of our calories come from refined carbohydrates in the form of sweetened processed foods, which are mostly devoid of essential minerals and nutrients. So we end up craving the vitamins and minerals that our body is lacking. Your body may be craving exactly what it needs.

Magnesium is needed for blood glucose control, muscle and nerve function, and blood pressure regulation. Chromium is necessary for controlling blood sugar, and turning food into energy. Calcium is needed to keep our blood acidity in check, as well as keeping bones and teeth strong.

The chocolate that your conscious mind craves is really a brilliant answer to the magnesium you didnt know you were lacking. And your body and brain know that to quench the nutritional based craving for the important mineral it needs is most easily, happily, and deliciously met by chocolate. (Of course, it also gets a nice hit of caffeine-like theobromine, sugar and fat, which it also likes very much, but probably doesnt need.)

So your body may be craving foods that get you a quick fix of these minerals. It likes to ask for the easiest foods that also give a hit of energy and sugar, too, so sometimes your cravings for magnesium are interpreted as chocolate...like, NOW.""

When my clients begin to see their nutritional cravings for what they are -- messages from the body to boost their micronutrient intake -- they feel the pressure and shame around their cravings totally relax, and begin to feel more in tune with -- and trusting of -- their amazing bodies.

Here are three of the top nutritional cravings you may experience, with easy options of healthy foods to answer your bodys real needs:

Chocolate = magnesium = hemp seeds, chia seeds, kelp

Oily Fatty Snacks = calcium = mustard greens, broccoli, sesame

Coffee = sulfur = egg yolks, garlic, onion





In my book, Women, Food & Desire, I go more in-depth into the nutritional, emotional, physical, and bacterial roots of our cravings.

As for our bacterial roots, put simply we are as bacterial as we are human. We couldnt live without them, as these tiny organisms help us digest and absorb nutrients from our food, help create vitamins and hormones, and keep our skin healthy. We dont even know the extent of their impact on our health yet, but one thing is for sure: they need to eat, too.

Some of these bacteria can get a little out of hand, like a bunch of frat boys who move into an apartment and wreck the place when they invite over dozens of their friends to feast on pizza and beer. Those bad guys, including the candida yeasts which result in vaginal yeast infections, have one favorite food that keeps them growing and multiplying: sugar.

Normally those little beasties are kept in check from overgrowing by the other good bacteria. But our modern lives are like a carpet bomb on the inner microbiomes healthy, balanced ecology. Everything from highly refined and sugary diets, constant stress, antibiotic overuse, and hormonal imbalance caused by toxins in our food and even overuse of birth control pills can kill off the good guys, leaving room for the bad guys to take over.

And its the puppet master that pulled your strings straight to the freezer for a dish of ice cream. Those bacteria live mostly in our digestive system, and communicate with our entire body through the nervous system, demanding to be fed, pulling us to crave sugary and starchy foods, as well as dairy with its milk sugar lactose.

Their sugar cravings are often your sugar cravings. Now, not all sugar cravings are caused by bacterial overgrowth, or dysbiosis, and weve all felt the emotionally calming call of a cupcake after a rough day or breakup.

But the dangers of these bacterial imbalances are real. Digestive distress from bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation, and leaky gut are all warning signs of bacterial disharmony. If these symptoms continue and grow, the puppet master will cause you to eat your way into weight loss resistance, hormonal and thyroid conditions, blood sugar imbalances, skin problems, and mood swings.

And your gut needs to be strong, healthy, and balanced in order for you to be strong and healthy. To heal your gut and support your digestion you need to keep the good bacteria constantly flowing in, with the right foods and supplements, and avoid the foods and stressors that keep the bad bacteria from moving back into town.

Foods that balance gut bacteria:

Naturally fermented foods like raw sauerkraut, kimchee, unpasteurized miso paste, and unpasteurized apple cider vinegar bring a wide variety of natural probiotics (the good bacteria) into your digestive system, many of which may not be found in man-made probiotic supplements.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,North Korea fires missiles into the sea in response to South Korea sanctions,[],"North Korea responded Thursday to new sanctions from South Korea by firing short-range ballistic missiles into the sea in a show of defiance and vowing to ""liquidate"" all remaining South Korean assets at former cooperative projects in the North.

The moves are the latest in an escalating standoff between the Koreas that began in January when North Korea detonated what it said was an ""H-bomb of justice,"" its fourth nuclear test. Since then, the North has launched a long-range rocket and the South has shut a jointly run factory park, slapped sanctions on the North, and begun large-scale war games with the United States. North Korea responded by threatening nuclear strikes on South Korea and the U.S. mainland.

The missile firing Thursday came a day after North Korean media printed photos of what appeared to be a mock-up of a nuclear warhead.

The North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said in a statement Thursday that North Korea will ""liquidate"" South Korean assets at the closed factory park in the North Korean border town of Kaesong and at a scrapped tourism resort at Diamond Mountain. In a continuation of bellicose rhetoric that has spiked in recent weeks, it said North Korea will also impose ""lethal"" military, political and economic blows on the South Korean government to accelerate its ""pitiable demise.""

South Korea's government called the North Korean statement a ""provocative act"" and warned the North not to damage any South Korean assets.

North Korea didn't say what exactly it would do with the South Korean assets. Observers said it could move the remaining manufacturing equipment at Kaesong to other industrial areas or convert it to military use, and use the South Korean-owned facilities at Diamond Mountain for its own tourism project.

The South Korean assets at Kaesong include buildings, manufacturing equipment and finished products. The assets at the resort are a hotel, a spa, a golf course and a building used for occasional reunions of Korean families separated by war. The assets are worth about $1.2 billion in total, according to Seoul's Unification Ministry.

The North Korean statement called the new South Korean sanctions ""laughable, unsightly,"" and referred to South Korea's female president, Park Geun-hye, as an ""American prostitute,"" the latest in a series of sexist attacks on her.

All of this has ratcheted up hostility on the already anxious Korean Peninsula. But, so far, analysts don't see the possibility of things spinning out of control. Some of the North's rhetoric is intended for a domestic audience to display government strength ahead of a major meeting of the ruling party in May.

The missiles fired by North Korea on Thursday flew about 310 miles before falling into the ocean off the country's east coast, Seoul's Defense Ministry said. They were believed to be Scud-type missiles, ministry spokesman Moon Sang Gyun said.

Such missile firings by the North are not uncommon when animosity rises. North Korea hates the annual military drills staged by Seoul and Washington, calling them preparations for an invasion. The allies say the drills, which this year are described as the biggest ever, are defensive and routine. North Korea warned at the start of the drills Monday of pre-emptive nuclear strikes.

On Wednesday, North Korea printed photos in official media of a purported mock-up of part of a nuclear warhead, with leader Kim Jong Un repeating a claim that his country has developed miniaturized atomic bombs that can be placed on missiles.

Information from secretive, authoritarian North Korea is often impossible to confirm, and the country's state media have a history of photo manipulation. But it was the first time the North has publicly displayed its purported nuclear designs, though it remains unclear whether the country has functioning warheads of that size or is simply trying to develop one.

South Korea's Defense Ministry on Wednesday disputed the North's claim that it possesses miniaturized warheads.

U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on North Korea's nuclear capabilities, saying it was an intelligence matter, but told reporters the U.S. takes the North's rhetoric seriously.

The United States said Wednesday it has dispatched three B-2 stealth bombers capable of launching nuclear as well as conventional weapons to the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. Strategic Command said the bombers will conduct training with the Australian military during their deployment, which amounts to a show of force at a time of mounting tensions with North Korea.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Why Republican voters are in revolt over corporate crony trade deals,['Richard Manning'],"The Michigan primary results on Tuesday signal a quantum shift in GOP voter attitudes on free trade policies that have served corporate crony agendas leaving the American people behind.

Thats not just analysis, it is fact based upon a just released Americans for Limited Government survey conducted by independent pollster Patrick Caddell. The stunning results of the Caddell study showed that GOP voters reject the global trade agenda at an even higher rate than Democrat voters, throwing conventional wisdom on its ear.

The ramifications for President Obamas ill-conceived Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) could not be more ominous. When asked in an informed question about whether the TPP should be passed in a lame duck Congress, Republican voters oppose it by a 66 to 15 margin, far outstripping Democrat or Independent opposition.

This represents a quantum shift in anticipated political party attitudes on an issue where Republican members of Congress could be counted upon to salute in almost lock-step in favor of any legislation labeled free trade.

The conversion point for Republican voters comes from a strong sense that the system is rigged against them in favor of the corporate cronies who manipulate the law to benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else.

Caddell found that GOP voters view the results of the free trade agreements over the past two decades serve as the primary indictment against any new agreement with a 59 percent saying that previous deals were more of a benefit to other countries, and a startlingly low 4 percent agreeing that free trade deals have been more of a benefit to the U.S. and only 14 percent who said they were equally beneficial to all.

The economic facts over the past two decades bear out GOP voters dismissal of the notion that trade deals help the United States. The year 2000 was the last year that the U.S. economy grew at 4 percent or above, and not coincidentally, the same year the U.S. granted China permanent normal trade relations.

What makes the current skepticism even more acute is the fact that the U.S. economy has not even grown at a 3 percent level since 2005, and the past ten years have had the worst level of GDP growth since the Great Depression as labor participation among working age adults has collapsed.

When asked in an informed question about whether Congress should pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership in a lame duck session as has been proposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, GOP voters answer with a resounding no, opposing passage of the deal by a 66 to 15 percent margin.

Republican power brokers, consultants and elites have been confounded by the utter rejection of every presidential candidate who has chosen to take on their mantle in this election season with Marco Rubios last place finishes in both Michigan and Mississippi providing the latest evidence. Caddell finds that GOP voters flat out dont trust their leaders to look out for the national or their own individual interests with 85 percent agreeing with the statement that, political leaders are more interested in protecting their power and privilege than doing what is right for the American people.

This stark wake-up call for GOP leadership is devastating, but it is survivable if they are willing to take stands that demonstrate that they are fighting to restore America.

In this regard, the GOP Senates decision to stand firm against allowing President Obama to fundamentally change the make-up of the Supreme Court rather than relying upon a vote of the people to make that decision is a great first step.

Every Republican candidate for President and Congress, should forcefully reject the notion of passing Obamas Trans-Pacific Partnership with a particular disdain for bringing it up in a lame duck when many of their colleagues will be looking for their next jobs rather than looking out for the interests of the American people.

By rejecting the status quo trade agenda of the D.C. elites, Congress will show the independence that their political base is looking for, reconnecting by taking a stand against those who are pulling the strings with no regard for the plight of Americans or America itself.

It is no secret that Republican voters are in outright revolt, they are tired of their prosperity being traded away and their childrens futures being diminished as our nations wealth gets transferred around the world to benefit corporate cronies with the pull to gain favor, and nations that dont like us very much.

They have caught on to the big lie that these trade agreements benefit them or America, and now it is time for GOP leaders to follow them and reject the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the latest in a long line of bad trade deals.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Pope imposes financial oversight for saints after abuses,[],"Pope Francis imposed new financial accountability regulations on the Vatican's multimillion-dollar saint-making machine Thursday after gross abuses were revealed in two books.

The rules require external vigilance over individual Vatican bank accounts created for beatification and canonization causes, as well as regular budgeting and accounting to make sure the donations from the faithful are being used as intended.

The reforms were imposed after Francis tasked a fact-finding commission to investigate Vatican expenditures. Two books by Italian journalists, based on the commission's confidential findings, revealed that the Vatican's secretive saint-making process brought in hundreds of thousands of euros in donations for each saintly candidate but had virtually no financial oversight as to how the money was spent.

The books estimated the average cost for each beatification at around $550,000, with much of the proceeds going to a few lucky people with contracts to do the often time-consuming investigations into the candidates' lives.

While candidates who inspire wealthy donors would sprint ahead, those with less wealthy fans would languish.

The new rules call for an administrator to be named for each saintly cause who must ""scrupulously respect"" the intention of each donation. The administrator must keep a running tab on expenditures and donations, prepare an annual budget and be subject to the oversight of the local bishop or religious superior. That person must approve the annual budget and send it to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints  the Vatican office responsible for reviewing saintly candidates, investigating miracles and preparing the cases for the pope's ultimate decision.

The rules also set out the mechanism by which each cause pays the congregation for its services finalizing the beatification or canonization, though it doesn't specify how much is given. Once the candidate is made a saint, the congregation decides what to do with any remaining funds, including sending them to a special solidarity account for less-well funded candidates.

The Catholic Church makes saints to give the faithful role models. The process is cloaked in secrecy and open to criticism, given that it deals with science-defying miracles and notoriously politicized choices. Pope John Paul II  himself canonized in near-record time in 2014  declared 482 saints in his quarter-century papacy, more than all of his predecessors combined.

In the early church, saints were often made by papal decree or popular acclaim. Over the centuries, the process has become far more detailed, legalistic, time-consuming and costly.

It usually starts in the diocese where the candidate lived or died. A postulator  essentially the cheerleader spearheading the project  gathers testimony and documentation to build the case and presents the report to the congregation. If the Vatican's experts agree the candidate lived a virtuous life, the case is forwarded to the pope who signs a decree attesting to the candidate's ""heroic virtues.""

Over time, the postulator may come across information that someone was miraculously healed by praying for God's intercession through the candidate. If the cure cannot be medically explained, the case is presented to the congregation as the possible miracle needed for beatification, the first major step in the sainthood process. Panels of doctors, theologians, bishops and cardinals must certify that the cure was instantaneous, complete and lasting  and was due to the intercession of the candidate. If convinced, the congregation sends the case to the pope who signs a decree saying the candidate can be beatified. A second miracle is needed for canonization.

Martyrs, or people who were killed for their faith, get a free pass and can be beatified without a miracle. A miracle is needed, however, for martyrs to be canonized.

Given the steps involved, the costs associated with the process can vary widely. If the postulator needs to travel around the world to gather testimony and documentation for the investigation or miracle hunt, the costs will be greater than for a candidate whose life can be investigated closer to home. A big-name candidate, such as a modern-day pope, will likely generate a far more in-depth investigation than a 5th-century hermit for whom there is limited documentation.

The rules were published just days before Francis is due to set the official date for his next big canonization: Mother Teresa. She's expected to be made a saint in the first week of September as part of Francis' Holy Year of Mercy celebrations.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Failed ObamaCare co-ops have not repaid $1.2B in federal loans, docs say",['Rich Edson'],"EXCLUSIVE: The dozen failed ObamaCare cooperatives have not repaid any of the $1.2 billion in federal loans they received and still owe more than $1 billion in additional liabilities, according to recent financial statements cited Thursday at a congressional hearing.

We shouldnt hold our breath on repayment, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said in his opening statement at the hearing.

In some states, these losses will be absorbed by other insurance companieswhich means, by the policyholders of other insurance companies who have to pay increased ... premiums, he said. In other states, doctors, hospitals and individual patients stand to suffer large out-of-pocket losses due to the co-op failuresas our report details.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

Portmans statement, first obtained by Fox News, refers to an investigation by the committees majority staff.

It claims the most recent balance sheets provided to the subcommittee show the failed cooperatives owe more than $700 million to doctors and hospitals for plan year 2015.

The failed cooperatives lost $376 million and exceeded the projected worst-case-scenario losses outlined in their loan applications by more than $260 million in 2014. They lost an additional billion dollars in 2015, according to the report.

Once the co-ops got going in 2014, things went south in a hurryboth in terms of financial losses and enrollment figures that wildly deviated from the co-ops own projections, Portman said. Despite getting regular reports that the co-ops were hemorrhaging cash, HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] took essentially no corrective action for over a year.

Deloitte Consulting initially granted the cooperatives a passing grade based on an HHS-designed grading scale. However it added seven of the 12 had serious deficiencies in their enrollment strategy, according to the report. Others submitted budgets that were incomplete, unreasonable, not cost-effective and several relied on unreasonable projections about their own growth.

The report cited in Portmans statement also claims that from 20142015, the administration lent an additional $848 million to the failed cooperatives, as they lost more than $1.4 billion.

In previous testimony, administration officials have told congressional panels that the administration scrutinized cooperative business plans and then placed them on corrective oversight when necessary.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

In 2015 we conducted 27 financial and operational reviews, 16 in-person visits, and had 43 formal communications, Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, told the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year. Not to mention hundreds of phone calls. And we've kept the states up to speed on every important interaction to help inform their regulatory actions.

When questioned how much money the government could salvage from the failed cooperatives, officials said they were only beginning to determine amounts.

We are in the process of recouping that loan money right now, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the chief operating officer and chief of staff of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, last month to a House panel. Well look at their excess revenue and then use all the tools available to us through their loan agreements and state and federal law to pull back federal tax dollars.

ObamaCare provided $2.4 billion in federal loans to establish 23 non-profit cooperatives. A dozen failed and the administration has required eight of the remaining eleven to adhere to a corrective action plan designed to fix business flaws and prevent additional failures. The closed cooperatives account for $1.2 billion in federal loans.

Defenders of the law and cooperatives say these non-profit insurers operated in difficult markets and that it often takes years of financial commitment to build a viable business.

The failed cooperatives left hundreds of thousands of customers searching for a new insurance company. In some states, the loss was significant.

HHS gave the New York co-op $90 million to prolong its financial life, rather than allow it to scale down, that co-op went on to lose another $544 million in 2015, according to Portmans statement, citing his staffs report.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner in the Democratic presidential delegate count, pledged she would address the market void left by the failed cooperatives.

We need to get more companies, more nonprofits, to fill this space. The ones that knew what they were doing have provided good services, but a lot of them have failed because they didn't have the right support, she said Monday at a Democratic presidential forum hosted by Fox News.

Even in those markets where those co-ops had previously operated, we have seen a commitment on the part of those who are administering the markets to try to facilitate greater competition, said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. And creating the co-ops was just one way to do that, but we certainly are going to be open to other ways to encourage other entities, private or public, to get engaged in this process.

When previously questioned by Congress, administration officials declined to forecast how many of the remaining cooperatives would survive this year.

The co-ops themselves are really the ones who are going to be the ones to determine whether or not they ultimately will be successful, said Cohen. They have a lot of work to do to rapidly mature their entities, their small businesses as you know and theyre still getting their foothold on this business.

FORMER FIRST LADY LAURA BUSH: Every time I have spoken with Afghan women, from the late fall of 2001, through my visits to Afghanistan, and up through today, I have been impressed by their resilience, their bravery, their ability to solve problems, and their desire to build a better country. And for many years, these women were silenced.

When I met with the new First Lady of Afghanistan Mrs. Rula Ghani last year at the Bush Center, she told me her goal: to dare the world to view Afghanistan in a different light. She said the Afghan people, particularly the women, dont want our pity; instead, they want our respect as business owners, doctors, parliamentarians, teachers, and writers. They want the world to recognize their successes and their desire to create lasting, positive change.

As one young Afghan woman says, I have the option to be optimistic or pessimistic and my choice is to be optimistic.

DP: You write in the introduction that 60 percent of the population in Afghanistan is under the age of 25 and they've never known peace. I would imagine that means that they are hungry to learn and need a safe and healthy environment in which to do so. When it comes to effective foreign aid, in Afghanistan and elsewhere, should there be a particular focus on women and children first?

MRS. BUSH: We know from research that when mothers are educated, their children are more likely to be educated and healthy. Education helps freedom thrive. Its very important that we help ensure Afghanistans young democracy advocates are prepared to be tomorrows political and civil society leaders. When you give children books and an education, you give them the ability to imagine a future of opportunity, equality, and justice.

DP: I was touched by many of the anecdotes in the book and have thought of Nasima Rahmani who writes about how important Voice of America was to her when she was able to listen to it. How important is it that the West continue to try to be a part of the daily lives of people around the world, especially where access to a free media may be limited?

MRS. BUSH: Ive heard stories from people in Central Europe and the Soviet bloc, who told me how important Voice of America was during the Cold War. I am grateful that VOA continues to broadcast news all over the world.

When it comes to the women in this book, the opportunity for free expression is the best support we can give to them. They are courageous enough to speak their minds, and by listening, we also have a chance to learn.

And that is why the Bush Institute published We Are Afghan Women. We wanted to shine a spotlight on the successes of Afghan women, and encourage sustained commitment to Afghan women and Afghanistan. We want Afghan women to know that George and I stand with them.

DP: As a former librarian and teacher, your love for books is well known, however, I'm not sure people appreciate how much you understand how stories can help influence thinking and advance an agenda. The stories in the book are beyond compelling -- was that part of your thinking when you embraced the project on behalf of the George W. Bush Institute, to make the problem more tangible through their own voices?

MRS. BUSH: Absolutely. They are Afghan stories, but they are also universal stories. Many women will recognize their own struggles against discrimination in education or in the workplace. We see women who confront domestic abuse and violence, serious and devastating problems not only in Afghanistan but here at home in the United States. We find inspiration in the stories of women who stood up to the naysayers who told them their business ideas would fail, and the women who would not accept problems but solved them. We share in the desire that Afghan mothers and fathers have for their own children to lead better lives.

DP: We Are Afghan Women comes at an important time as America makes decisions on how long we should keep troops in the country and how much support we should provide. Resources are scarce, but in your experience, have you seen that investing in women in a country like Afghanistan can have immediate and larger pay-off?

MRS. BUSH: Yes, of course. George and I believe that women are the catalysts of change. I launched the American University of Afghanistan on my trip to Afghanistan in 2005. When the doors opened in 2006, there were 52 men and one woman enrolled. Last year, I was presented with an honorary degree by the 2014 valedictorian of AUAF, a woman from Kabul named Onaba Payab. Onaba now works to promote education and economic rights for all Afghan women and is pursuing a masters degree in public health. Her story proves that investments in the success of women are investments that pay off. And we know the inclusion of women in all aspects of society strengthens and improves the stability of their countries.

We all can promote a better future for Afghanistan. We need to ensure that Afghanistan does not become a terrorist haven or fall to the Taliban or ISIS. To do that, we need to continue to assist Afghan security forces, and I welcome President Obamas decision to maintain a US military presence through 2016 and beyond.

We must never forget that what happens in Afghanistan  and elsewhere in the world  matters to us here at home.

""Watson helps Connie understand and respond naturally to the needs and interests of Hilton's guests -- which is an experience that's particularly powerful in a hospitality setting, where it can lead to deeper guest engagement, said Rob High, chief technology officer of IBM Watson, in the companys press release.

Famous for its appearance on the quiz show Jeopardy, Watson is at the heart of IBMs efforts to expand its technologys reach across multiple industries. The supercomputer, for example, is at the core of a new partnership between the tech giant and Under Armour. As part of a deal announced at CES earlier this year, Watson will power what IBM and Under Armour are touting as the worlds first complete health and fitness insights app.

NEW YORK, March 9 (Reuters) - The FBI eavesdropped on meetings involving Russian intelligence personnel in New York City, including a suspected spy posing as a trade representative, by hiding recorders in binders containing supposedly confidential information about the energy sector, U.S. prosecutors said.

SEE ALSO: First US uterus transplant fails

The hours of covert recordings from 2013 were disclosed in papers filed in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday in the case of Evgeny Buryakov, a Russian citizen who U.S. prosecutors say posed as a banker while participating in a Cold War-style spy ring.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation's eavesdrops enabled the agency to penetrate the workplaces of Russia's foreign intelligence service, the SVR, and hear about Buryakov's work for it, prosecutors said.

They also captured one Russian agent, also charged in the case, complaining about the lack of excitement in his job, saying he expected it ""would be just slightly more down to earth than in the movies about James Bond.""

The disclosure came ahead of an April 4 trial for Burkyakov, who was arrested in January 2015 as prosecutors unveiled charges against him and the two other Russians, Igor Sporyshev and Victor Podobnyy.

Prosecutors say the trio conspired to gather economic intelligence for Russia, including information about U.S. sanctions against the country, and to recruit intelligence sources in New York City.

Neither Sporyshev and Podobnyy, who made the James Bond comment, were arrested, as they enjoyed diplomatic immunity in their respective roles as a Russian trade representative and an attache to the country's mission to the United Nations.

Buryakov, who worked at Russian state-owned Vnesheconombank, has pleaded not guilty. Neither his lawyer nor the Russian consulate responded immediately to requests for comment.

According to prosecutors, in April 2012, Sporyshev met an undercover FBI employee posing as an analyst at a New York energy firm at an oil and gas industry conference.

Over the next two years, they met to discuss the industry and other economic and political issues, prosecutors said, with Sporyshev providing gifts and cash for information.

In 2013, the FBI employee began providing Sporyshev with the binders containing purported industry analysis he wrote, supporting documents, and ""covertly placed recording devices,"" prosecutors wrote.

As the undercover employee said his company would fire him if it learned he disclosed confidential information, Sporyshev would promptly return the binders after reviewing them, prosecutors said.

The recordings that resulted captured statements of Sporyshev, Podobnyy, and other Russian intelligence personnel from January to May 2013, prosecutors said.

Under House Bill 4, also known as the Parent Involvement and Accountability Act, teachers would be required to grade parents involvement with their childrens education.

The legislation, by state Rep. Gregory Holloway (D-Hazlehurst), would mandate a section be added to each childs report card on which the parents are graded on their responsiveness to communication with teachers, the students completion of homework and readiness for tests, and the frequency of absences and tardiness.

Mary Clare Reim, research associate on education at the Heritage Foundation, said the bill is the wrong way to encourage more parental involvement.

My initial reaction is, this is absurd, Reim said. The concept that parents should be graded by teachers on their involvement is a reversal of what the education system should look like. Parents should be grading teachers on their performance. Putting grades on parental involvement from the top down is not the way this should work.

Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald urged witnesses to come forward. ""We must say enough is enough.""

Officials on Thursday released the names of the victims: Tina Shelton, 37; Jerry Shelton, 35; Brittany Powell, 27; Chanetta Powell, 25; and Shada Mahone, 26.

The shooting unfolded late Wednesday at a house on Franklin Avenue in Wilkinsburg, just east of downtown Pittsburgh. Four people were killed on the home's back porch, Allegheny County Lt. Andrew Schurman said. A fifth person died from her injuries at a local hospital.

Allegheny County police said two injured men were in critical condition early Thursday, while a woman was in stable condition.

Schurman described the gathering at the home as ""a backyard party or cookout of some sort"", but did not elaborate further. He said gunshots came from two distinct locations but police don't believe anyone at the party fired back.



""It looks like right now they were all fleeing toward the back door of the residence when the second gunman fired from the side of the yard,"" he said. ""They all seemed to get caught on the back porch.""



It wasn't clear why the gunmen may have opened fire.

Wilkinsburg is a poorer, largely blighted suburb known for drug trafficking and gun violence. But, neighbors described the street on which the shooting occurred as generally quiet and expressed shock. They said they heard between 20 and 25 gunshots.

""It went on for almost a minute,"" James Boyd told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ""I thought it was maybe the pipes bursting. But then we realized it was gunshots. We've had trouble in this neighborhood before but never this close to home.""

An unidentified woman who said she lived one house away from the shooting scene told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that her neighbors had a cookout earlier in the day and were still in their backyard when the shots rang out.

""It sounded like a war,"" she said.

A Galion police report says video shows the backyard fight began during an ongoing argument between two girls, and one started punching the other. The first girl fell to the ground and the other girl continued punching her. Two others then hit the first girl and yelled obscenities.

Brianna McCullough, the injured girl's mother, says it's disturbing that witnesses recorded on cellphones but didn't intervene or help her daughter. The teen drove herself home and was hospitalized.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,"In Latino-focused debate, Democratic candidates go after wildly coveted Florida vote",[],"Just days away from the critical primary in Florida, home to 1.8 million Latinos, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders accused each other in a debate Wednesday of flip-flopping on measures to help undocumented immigrants, and vowed to reform immigration, either through Congress or executive powers.

Clinton, who is the front-runner in the race to be the Democratic nominee for the presidential election, and her rival Sanders both vowed not to deport undocumented children or others who have not committed crimes.

Both candidates said they would make comprehensive immigration reform a priority if they become president, and if they could not achieve it through a congressional measure, they would use executive powers to extend protections to those without documents.

But while Sanders and Clinton agreed on many aspects of how to reform immigration, they bitterly accused each other of flip-flopping on the topic, and of previously being against efforts to extend breaks to undocumented immigrants.

In the debate, held in Miami and aired on Univision and CNN, Clinton faulted Sanders for repeatedly voting against a 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill; he faulted her for opposing a 2007 effort to allow people who were in the country illegally to obtain driver's licenses.

Sanders said Clinton supported turning back children flowing into the country from Honduras and said he wouldn't deport children or immigrants without criminal records.

Clinton was pressed on whether she would follow President Barack Obama's approach, which moderator Jorge Ramos, an Univision anchor, said would be tantamount to becoming ""the next deporter-in-chief.""

Clinton says she doesn't have the same policies of the ""current administration"" and would move to ""stop the raids"" and ""stop the roundups.""

In an effort to bring the immigration issue to a personal level, Univision had a member of the audience address the candidates.

A Guatemalan woman whose husband was deported because of a driver's license asked the candidates in Spanish: ""What will you do to stop deportations and reunite families?""

Clinton praised Lucia Quiej, saying what she did was an ""incredible act of courage.""

""It is time to bring families together. More Americans need to know what the human cost of these policies are,"" Clinton said.

Quiej's eyes watered as the Univision reporter translated what the candidates were saying.

""I will do everything I can to prevent other families to face what you are facing,"" Clinton said.

Both Sanders and Clinton criticized Trump, saying he uses divisive, offensive tactics to get support.

Clinton called Trump ""un-American.""

She said Trump traffics in ""prejudice and paranoia"" and says voters can draw their own conclusions about him. She added: ""You don't make America great again by getting rid of everything that made America great.""

Sanders says voters will ""never elect"" someone like Trump, pointing out that he has insulted many kinds of people, including African Americans, women and Muslims. He noted that Trump was part of the ""birther"" movement to tag President Barack Obama as not American.

Ramos, who said that his daughter Paola works for the Clinton campaign, asked the former secretary of state if she'd drop out of the presidential race should her use of a private server while secretary of state result in a federal indictment.

""Oh for goodness and it's not going to happen,"" she said, adding, ""I'm not even answering that question.""

Clinton said she broke no rules by running her State Department email account from a private server located in her New York home, though she now calls the decision ""a mistake."" The messages were classified by government agencies years after she sent them, she said.

""I did not send or receive any emails marked classified at the time,"" says Clinton. ""What you're talking about retroactive classification.""

Sanders also chastised Clinton for misrepresenting her vote for a federal bailout of the auto industry.

The 2008 vote, he said Wednesday, was part of a larger legislative package that benefited big Wall Street banks.

At the time, Clinton represented New York in the Senate. Sanders told a Miami audience attending the Democratic debate that Clinton backed the bill then because it helped a home-state industry.

""Then you go to Detroit and suddenly this legislation helps autoworkers,"" he says.

Clinton said it was a ""hard vote"" and if everyone joined Sanders then the industry would have failed.

Matters of special concern to the Latino community loomed large. Florida is home to nearly 1.8 million Hispanics, including about 15 percent of the state's Democrats.

Cuba, Nicaragua and Puerto Rico came up as issues the candidates were asked about. The moderators asked about former socialist leaders Fidel Castro of Cuba and Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua. And they also asked about the Puerto Rico economic crisis.

There was a pointed question to Sanders on how his socialist government would differ from that of social regimes

Sanders said he was against U.S. invading Cuba and back the overthrow of the governments of Nicaragua and Guatemala. He brought up the Monroe Doctrine, saying the U.S. cannot meddle in other governments.

""I think the U.S. should be working with governments around the world,"" he said, not trying to change regimes.

On Puerto Rico, Clinton said the government should give Puerto Rico authority to restructure its debt.

What we see in Puerto Rico now is a lot of suffering, said Clinton.

Sanders, meanwhile, blamed Wall Street sharks for Puerto Rico's debt problems.

That little island is $73 billion in debt, he said. ""Who's at fault? Vulture capitalists.

The candidates also are focusing on a broader audience, with Missouri, Illinois, Ohio and North Carolina also in Tuesday's primary lineup, and a total of 691 delegates at stake.

A good share of Florida voters already have locked in their decisions: nearly 487,000 Democrats have cast early ballots, representing about 11 percent of registered Democrats.

Hispanic voters have made up about 10 percent of voters in the Democratic primaries so far this year, and Clinton has been getting about two-thirds of their votes to about one-third for Sanders. The Vermont senator, for his part, stresses that he's making progress on winning over younger Hispanics.

One week out from the Florida primary, Clinton holds a lead in opinion polls there. But she also led in pre-primary polls in Michigan, where Sanders surprised her with a 50 percent to 48 percent victory.

Clinton has won 762 pledged delegates compared to 549 for Sanders, with 10 delegates from recent primaries still to be allocated. When superdelegates are included, Clinton leads 1,223 to 574, more than halfway to the 2,383 needed to win the Democratic nomination.

What if the law of the land is that a document or email contains state secrets by virtue of the information or data in the document or email and not by virtue of any warning label? What if the legal definition of a ""state secret"" in the U.S. is ""information the revelation of which could cause harm to the security of the United States""?

What if it is the law of the land that everyone in the government to whom state secrets are entrusted receives a multi-hour tutorial from the FBI on how to protect state secrets? What if the successful completion of that tutorial is a legal prerequisite to the receipt of a national security clearance and thus the receipt of state secrets?

What if that tutorial reminds the people to whom secrets are being reposed that it is their legal obligation to recognize and accept and understand the law before they can receive any state secrets? What if, in order to confirm that understanding, all people who receive the tutorial are required to sign an oath at the end of the tutorial recognizing, accepting and understanding the law and agreeing to be bound by it? What if Clinton signed just such an oath?

What if Clinton had no intention of complying with the oath she signed at the time she signed it? What if we know that because we know she hired the information technologist to divert her emails the same week she received the FBI tutorial? What if she never told the FBI that she planned to divert all her emails -- including those that would contain state secrets -- to a private non-secure email server in her home?

What if it is the law of the land that the failure to secure state secrets is a felony, known as espionage? What if it is the law of the land that espionage can be committed by a person who intends to expose state secrets or by a person who doesnt care if she exposes state secrets? What if the FBI explained to Clinton in her first day as secretary of state that the grossly negligent exposure of state secrets constitutes espionage?

What if before Clinton was secretary of state, she was a U.S. senator from New York for eight years? What if during that time, she was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee? What if during her time in the Senate, she was exposed to hundreds of military-related state secrets?

What if Clinton is smart enough and shrewd enough and experienced enough to recognize a state secret when she sees one?

What if the FBI has seen emails in which Clinton ordered subordinates deliberately to avoid State Department secure channels of communications and to send state secrets to her through channels she knew were not secure? What if Clinton passed on state secrets to others who had no security clearances? What if she did so knowing she was sending state secrets from her non-secure server to other non-secure servers?

What if Clinton sent or received more than 2,000 emails that contained state secrets? What if she authored more than 100 of them herself? What if some of the 2,000 emails were so secret that the FBI agents investigating her lack the security clearances to view those emails?

What if Clinton did all this so that she could keep her behavior as secretary of state secret and away from all officials in the State Department outside her inner circle, away from the president and away from the American people? What if she orchestrated and carried out a conspiracy to violate the Espionage Act?

What if the law of the land is that a document or email contains state secrets by virtue of the information or data in the document or email and not by virtue of any warning label? What if the legal definition of a ""state secret"" in the U.S. is ""information the revelation of which could cause harm to the security of the United States""?

What if it is the law of the land that people in the government to whom state secrets are entrusted are required to recognize the secrets when they see them and protect them from intentional or inadvertent revelation?

What if it is the law of the land that everyone in the government to whom state secrets are entrusted receives a multi-hour tutorial from the FBI on how to protect state secrets? What if the successful completion of that tutorial is a legal prerequisite to the receipt of a national security clearance and thus the receipt of state secrets?

What if that tutorial reminds the people to whom secrets are being reposed that it is their legal obligation to recognize and accept and understand the law before they can receive any state secrets? What if, in order to confirm that understanding, all people who receive the tutorial are required to sign an oath at the end of the tutorial recognizing, accepting and understanding the law and agreeing to be bound by it? What if Clinton signed just such an oath?

What if Clinton had no intention of complying with the oath she signed at the time she signed it? What if we know that because we know she hired the information technologist to divert her emails the same week she received the FBI tutorial? What if she never told the FBI that she planned to divert all her emails -- including those that would contain state secrets -- to a private non-secure email server in her home?

What if it is the law of the land that the failure to secure state secrets is a felony, known as espionage? What if it is the law of the land that espionage can be committed by a person who intends to expose state secrets or by a person who doesnt care if she exposes state secrets? What if the FBI explained to Clinton in her first day as secretary of state that the grossly negligent exposure of state secrets constitutes espionage?

What if before Clinton was secretary of state, she was a U.S. senator from New York for eight years? What if during that time, she was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee? What if during her time in the Senate, she was exposed to hundreds of military-related state secrets?

What if Clinton is smart enough and shrewd enough and experienced enough to recognize a state secret when she sees one?

What if the FBI has seen emails in which Clinton ordered subordinates deliberately to avoid State Department secure channels of communications and to send state secrets to her through channels she knew were not secure? What if Clinton passed on state secrets to others who had no security clearances? What if she did so knowing she was sending state secrets from her non-secure server to other non-secure servers?

What if Clinton sent or received more than 2,000 emails that contained state secrets? What if she authored more than 100 of them herself? What if some of the 2,000 emails were so secret that the FBI agents investigating her lack the security clearances to view those emails?

What if Clinton did all this so that she could keep her behavior as secretary of state secret and away from all officials in the State Department outside her inner circle, away from the president and away from the American people? What if she orchestrated and carried out a conspiracy to violate the Espionage Act?

What if the FBI is onto her? What if the Democrats are not?

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,The Future of Farming May Live Inside This Box,['Jade Scipioni'],"Could shipping containers be the future of local produce? A Boston-based startup called Freight Farms thinks so.

Continue Reading Below

The company is transforming the containers into grow machines  or what they like to call Leafy Green Machines  in hopes of turning everyday people into farmers.

We are taking this back to the way it was 200 years ago, where local food was the expectation and people were actually part of the food system, Freight Farms CEO Brad McNamara tells FOXBusiness.com. And, theyre targeting anyone with a real motivation to do their own thing and be part of the food system.

Its entrepreneurs, the husband-wife teams, retirees, former veterans. You name it!

Freight Farms is part a new wave of companies that are bringing innovation to agriculture while meeting the growing demand for high-quality, fresh, locally grown and sustainable produce. Other brands include CropBox in North Carolina, Growtainers in Dallas, and PodPonics in Atlanta.

These containers have basically been upcycled to be a hydroponic farm with about an acre of farmland, says David Schmitz, who runs a freight farm at Stony Brook University in Long Island, New York.

Schmitz and his student interns are producing around 800 heads of lettuce per week for their school cafeteria. And, theyre doing it all year long while using 90% less water than regular farming, no pesticides and no soil; all within a 320-square-foot space.

Were probably hitting 800 to 1,000 students per week with our produce, adds Schmitz.

The best part says McNamara is that the shipping container farms cost a fraction of the price of a commercial-scale urban greenhouse, which requires significant capital. One Freight Farm costs around $82,000 with an additional $20,000 per year for operating costs.

Students Kylie Campanelli and Chad Marvin, who are part of the Sustainability Studies Program at Stony Brook, say the farm is easy to run and only requires around 20 hours of maintenance a week.



McNamara also says that part of the fee includes a two-day farming boot camp, where soon-to-be farmers visit them at their headquarters in Boston.

Its to get the person from the street to a commercial farmer, he says.

To make things even easier, Freight Farms also has a mobile app called Farm Hand, where up-and-coming farmers can monitor their settings remotely.

Related Image Expand / Contract

We also built a mobile first super hydroponic store app called Farmhand SHOP app so were able to go to all the vendors and source all the best materials for our farmers, says McNamara. Our goal is to empower more people to be farmers.

To date, the AgTech company has about 60 farms worldwide including in 20 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces, with a lot of international pilots kicking off later this year.

Major corporations like Google,(GOOG), Aramark. (ARMK) and Marriott (MAR) have also jumped on board, adding container farms to some of their corporate campuses and hotels.

The startup, which launched in 2010 after raising $30,000 from a Kickstarter campaign, received an additional $3.7 million in venture funding in December 2014 from Spark Capital.

I see Freight Farms being a global network of people based in a community of growers who are producing food for their local market in the way that their local market demands, adds McNamara.

Nearly 40 percent of adults with HIV/AIDS in Africa die of TB as almost half of TB cases remain undiagnosed and untreated, according to researcher Keertan Dheda, whose study was published in The Lancet medical journal.

""For patients with advanced HIV, it's hard to diagnose what infection they have and it's particularly hard to diagnose TB,"" Dheda told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

TB is the leading cause of death in people with HIV in low- and middle-income countries, Dheda wrote in The Lancet. The World Health Organisation has said TB now rivals HIV/AIDS as a leading cause of death from infectious diseases.

Diagnosing TB in patients with HIV is difficult because conventional tests require taking an X-ray of the chest and a mucus sample, though for severely ill patients it can be hard to produce mucus, Dheda said.

The new urine test, which costs $2.66, provides results in 25 minutes and does not require a mucus sample.

""What we showed in the study is that if you use this new test and a guided treatment based on this test you can actually save lives,"" Dheda said by phone from South Africa.

The test was particularly effective in identifying TB among patients with advanced HIV infection who were most vulnerable to TB, the study said.

""The absolute reduction in mortality was small at 4 percent, but with 300,000 patients with HIV dying from TB in Africa every year, implementing this low-cost, rapid, bedside test could potentially save thousands of lives annually,"" Dheda said in a statement.

""The reduction in mortality is likely to be because urine testing, in conjunction with routine testing, resulted in a greater proportion of patients starting tuberculosis treatment early.""

He said the test can be used to diagnose TB in patients with HIV anywhere in the world.

The research was carried out on 2,500 patients in 10 hospitals across four countries in sub-Saharan Africa.",[]

The system aims to innovate in the prevention of a disease whose late diagnosis makes treatment more difficult and reduces the chances of a good outcome, the university said in a statement.

The bra contains software that monitors and records via two infrared sensors both breasts' temperature, providing important information to detect possible abnormal cells.

""When cells foreign to the mammary glands are present, the body requires more blood to circulate in the area where the invasive cells are, and thus the temperature rises,"" student Maria Camila Cortes Arcila, a member of the team, said.

Students and electronic engineering professors at the university in Manizales, a city in central Colombia, have been working since last June on the project, which has been tested with 189 women, of whom 166 were healthy, 12 showed some mammary gland pathology other than cancer, four had cancer and seven had undergone a mastectomy.

The trial tested the sensors' effectiveness and the differences in temperature between women diagnosed with breast cancer and other volunteers.

The researchers said they did not want ""to do the physician's job,"" but instead were trying to improve prevention with a bra that they will now try to develop and sell at a price ""affordable for any woman.""

The statement said there was an initial prototype of the new bra and researchers were working on making it better.

Not only does he have time to spend on any number of philanthropic endeavors, he's also not shy about engaging in a Reddit AMA every now and again.

That said, Gates on Tuesday afternoon returned to Reddit for the fourth time where he answered questions on a whole host of topics, including the FBI's ongoing legal battle with Apple, how he used to skip class while he was a student at Harvard, and much more.

DON'T MISS: Ex-boyfriend brilliantly trolls woman who won't return iPhone he gave her as a gift

With respect to the mobile encryption issue that Apple and the FBI are currently embroiled in, Gates took a middle of the road approach when asked for his take on the issue.

""I think there needs to be a discussion about when the government should be able to gather information,"" Gates answered. ""What if we had never had wiretapping? Also the government needs to talk openly about safeguards. Right now a lot of people don't think the government has the right checks to make sure information is only used in criminal situations. So this case will be viewed as the start of a discussion. I think very few people take the extreme view that the government should be blind to financial and communication data but very few people think giving the government carte blanche without safeguards makes sense. A lot of countries like the UK and France are also going through this debate. For tech companies there needs to be some consistency including how governments work with each other. The sooner we modernize the laws the better.""

When asked what he would do if he found himself in Apple's position, Gates answered: ""Maybe they could propose an overall plan for striking the balance between government being able to know things in some cases and having safeguards to make sure those powers are confined to appropriate cases. There is no avoiding this debate and they could contribute to how the balance should be struck.""

Of course, the entirety of the AMA wasn't exclusively devoted to serious topics. For instance, when asked what his fondest memory from Harvard was, Gates recalled a rather amusing story.

I decided that I would be different and never attend any class I was signed up for but always attend a class I wasn't signed up for. This worked out in a funny way when the final exam for a Combinatorics class (which I signed up for) was given at the same table as my Brain studies class (which I attended and did not sign up for). My friends from Brain studies thought it was very strange that I sat on the wrong side of the table and took the Combinatorics exam even when I was the most vocal student in the Brain class.

When asked how he was able to make this work, given that he was taking an exam for a class he never attended, Gates added:

I studied super hard during reading period and almost always got A's. The big exception was organic chemistry where the promised video tapes of the lectures sometimes had no sound or no video -- that spooked me and I ended up getting a C+ in the course!

Oh that Gates, always tough to keep tabs on that guy. And truth be told, a C+ in organic chemistry without attending any classes is impressive in its own right.

When asked for his thoughts on what the next biggest advancement in technology will be over the next two decades, Gates said that robots with vision ""and manipulation as good as humans"" will be something that will achieved within a 10-year window. Gates further added that ""medical advances will also be amazing and unbelievable.""

As for what type of technological advancements scare Gates, the Microsoft founder said that biological tools would certainly pose a threat should they wind up in the wrong hands.

Some other notable tidbits from the AMA include:

Gates believes Pirates of Silicon Valley "" was a reasonable recapitulation of the early days of the PC industry.""

was a reasonable recapitulation of the early days of the PC industry."" Gates always uses the latest version of Windows, hardly a shocker.

Programming was the most useful thing Gates ever learned. ""I was obsessed with programming from age 14 to 19 and that is a good time to keep trying to improve.""

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Twitter Bets On Payouts To Rein In Talent Flight,[],"Twitter is sweetening its employee compensation packages to stem a talent drain, a pressing move that may be followed by other tech companies with sinking stock prices.



Over the past month, the social media company has been offering additional restricted stock to employees companywide, extending from the upper ranks to junior-level employees, people familiar with the matter said.



In an unusual move, Twitter has granted varying amounts of restricted stock depending on when the employees started working, intending to make up for the value they lost since joining the company, these people said.



Since the fall, the company has also been doling out cash bonuses to some employees ranging from $50,000 to $200,000 as an incentive to keep employees around for another six months to a year, according to other people close to the company.



Together, the payouts show how Twitter is trying to allay employee jitters about a stock price that has fallen about 60% in the past 12 months. Since Jack Dorsey was named chief executive in early October, the stock has fallen by roughly one-third, with investors remaining concerned about stalled user growth. Mr. Dorsey himself announced not long after he took over as CEO that he would be giving roughly one-third of his Twitter stock to the company's employee equity pool. That donation is still subject to shareholder approval.



More broadly, Twitter's moves speak to the realities of keeping pace with Silicon Valley's talent wars, pressure that has intensified as the public markets have soured on Twitter and other tech companies in recent months. Companies with spiraling stock prices, such as LinkedIn and VMware, have recently sought to beef up employee equity packages, and compensation experts say others are likely to follow suit.

Continue Reading Below



""This is a fairly unique approach to dealing with this particular issue [at Twitter], but it will nowhere be the only unique approach we see in the next six to 12 months because the market has been ugly for these companies,"" said Dan Walter, CEO of Performensation, a compensation consulting firm that focuses on equity.



""Developing, retaining, and recruiting top talent is critical to Twitter's business success and building shareholder value,"" Twitter said in a statement. ""Competitive compensation, strong leadership, and a confidence in the direction of the company are all key elements to having top talent. We are investing in all three areas to ensure we maintain these employees.""



The offers at Twitter came over the past month at around the time Twitter granted additional compensation to three executive officers that could be worth nearly $55.4 million for taking on heavier workloads amid a reorganization of the management team.



These latest compensation packages to rank-and-file employees haven't been uniform, however. According to current employees and others close to the company, the guiding principle in calculating roughly how much additional stock is offered was predicated on how much the estimated value of an employee's restricted stock has fallen since they joined.



In other words, someone who joined around the time Twitter's stock soared to an all-time closing high of $73.31 on Dec. 26, 2013, the month after the company's initial public offering, is likely to have received more restricted stock than a veteran employee who joined before it went public.



The compensation bump has been the latest in a series of morale-boosting efforts by Mr. Dorsey after slashing up to 8% of the workforce in October to narrow Twitter's focus. Several senior executives have left in recent months and the company has also continued to lose employees to up-and-coming startups such as work-collaboration software maker Slack and ride-hailing service Lyft, according to employee announcements and changes to LinkedIn profiles.



Over the past year, Twitter's stock has continued to slide, at one point in February reaching an all-time low close of $14.31. On Wednesday, Twitter shares fell 3.7% to $17.66.



As team leaders pulled various employees into one-on-one meetings over the past month, workers were told that the additional shares were meant to bump them back up to where they had started, according to one of the people familiar with the matter.



Compensation experts say Twitter's measures are unusual in their extent and in the way the grants have been structured.



""To do it across a whole group and to do it for this reason is shocking and highly effective,"" said Valerie Frederickson, founder and CEO of Frederickson Pribula Li, a Silicon Valley-based human-resources executive consulting firm. ""It's effective at keeping employees on a sinking ship.""



Still, it is a risky move, especially considering Twitter's already unusually high stock-based compensation costs. Of the 172 U.S. tech companies with at least $1 billion in revenue last year, Twitter had the highest stock-based compensation costs as a percentage of its revenue at 30.8%, according to data provided by S&P Capital IQ. That is nearly double Facebook's 16.6% and four times Google parent Alphabet's 7%.



Twitter isn't alone in its attempts to retain employees as other tech stocks have suffered in recent months. LinkedIn said earlier this month that CEO Jeff Weiner will distribute his annual equity package, valued at about $14 million, to the employee pool.



VMware, an EMC Corp.-controlled seller of data center software, has also been handing out extra shares to employees. In November, VMware issued restricted stock units and cash bonuses to encourage employees to stay there through various periods in 2016, according to a former employee.



The cash bonuses were $60,000 in some cases, targeting engineers and executives within the company's cloud-computing group, according to the former employee who was there at the time.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Iran claims its missile tests do not violate nuclear deal,[],"Iran's foreign ministry insisted on Thursday that the missile tests carried out by the country's Revolutionary Guard this week do not violate Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers or a U.N. Security Council resolution.

According to ministry spokesman, Hossein Jaberi Ansari, the missiles were ""conventional defensive instruments and they were merely for legitimate defense,"" the official IRNA news agency reported.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard test-launched two ballistic missiles on Wednesday emblazoned with the phrase ""Israel must be wiped out"" in Hebrew  a show of power by the Shiite nation, long an opponent of Israel.

It was the latest in a series of recent tests, aimed at demonstrating Iran's intentions to push ahead with its ballistic program after scaling backing its nuclear program under the deal reached last year with the U.S. and other world powers.

Israel's Foreign Ministry condemned the launch, saying it did violate the U.N. resolution and that it shows that Iran ""continues to dismiss the international community's demands and to develop its aggressive capabilities."" In a statement Thursday, the ministry called on the world to ""react firmly and decisively"" against further Iranian missile launches.

However, Ansari said the test-firing ""did not defy the Security Council resolution"" and added that Iran will continue its missile program. He also said Iran will remain committed to its international obligations.

""The Islamic Republic of Iran will not compromise over its security and defensive power,"" said Ansari.

""It will continue it's completely defensive and legitimate missile program while observing its international commitments and without entering into the fields of either nuclear warheads or designing missiles capable of carrying such warheads,"" he added.

The landmark nuclear deal, under which Iran accepted to substantially cap its nuclear program, does not include provisions against missile launches. When it came into effect on Jan. 16, the Security Council lifted most U.N. sanctions against Tehran  including a ban it had imposed in 2010 on Iran testing missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.

That ban likely would have covered some of the missile fired this week. To deal with the restrictions in the nuclear agreement, the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution last July which among other measures ""calls on"" Iran not to carry out such tests.

Late Wednesday, the head of the airspace division of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Amir Ali Hejazi, told state TV that the Hebrew markings on the missiles tested earlier in the day were ""a choice by colleagues"" who worked on the missiles, indicating it was not an official, high-level decision.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Cleanup of Massachusetts Chipotle complete after norovirus scare,[],"Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc received praise for its handling of potential norovirus infections at a Boston-area restaurant, as sick employees stayed home and the burrito chain quickly cleaned the restaurant.

Shares of Chipotle fell as much as 6.1 percent early, then gained back some ground after the head of the Billerica, Massachusetts public health department said the restaurant was cleaned and would reopen on Thursday. The stock closed down 3.4 percent at $506.63.

The closure of the Chipotle in the Boston suburb was seen as a partial test of a new food safety system rolled out after a series of illnesses hit the fresh burrito chain last year.

That workers stayed home in particular was a good sign, said Doug Powell, publisher of the food safety site barfblog.com. ""It is an indication that the system is working,"" he said. But customers may focus only on the sickness, not the company response. For burrito fans, ""It's just - ooh, they're barfing at Chipotle again,"" Powell said.

The company response was not a test of new measures to ensure ingredients are safe and avoid E.coli, he added.

Chipotle food scares last year include two E.coli outbreaks linked to its restaurants that sickened more than 50 people in 10 states, as well as separate outbreaks of norovirus, a highly contagious virus known as the ""winter vomiting bug"", in Massachusetts and California that involved more than 350 diners.

Three employees are suspected to have norovirus in Billerica, the town's Board of Health said. Earlier in the day, local Public Health Director Richard Berube told reporters that one of the three had been confirmed to have the virus.

Berube said Chipotle has been ""very proactive"" and remaining staff at the burrito restaurant would be screened for norovirus, he added.

Berube, the company and the Massachusetts Department of Public Health all said no customers were known to be sick.

""They did the right thing,"" said Howard Penney, who covers the chain for Hedgeye Risk Management. However, he argued that Chipotle was still a ""broken company"" and that it would take years to return to its peak performance.

Chipotle spokesman Chris Arnold said the company closed the restaurant after employees called in sick.

The restaurant closure comes as Chipotle has tried to lure back diners with coupons for a free burrito and other food.

Chipotle sales have fallen sharply since the E.coli outbreaks came to light late last year. The stock traded above $750 last summer.

Sales at established Chipotle restaurants tumbled 14.6 percent in the fourth quarter, including a drop of 30 percent in the month of December.

""The publicity around this news announcement will be another negative data-point that may affect consumer demand,"" CRT Capital analyst Lynne Collier said in a client note.

Chipotle temporarily closed all of its U.S. restaurants on Feb. 8 during prime lunch hours to hold staff meetings on food safety.

Up to Tuesday's close of $524.69, the company's stock had fallen about 18 percent since the first E.coli outbreak was reported on Oct. 31.",[]

Coy Wesbrook's lethal injection was the eighth this year nationally and fourth in Texas, which carries out capital punishment more than any state. Two Georgia inmates have been executed so far in 2016, plus one each in Alabama and Florida.

Before being executed, the 58-year-old Wesbrook apologized profusely to some of his victims' relatives who witnessed the punishment.

""I want to say that I'm sorry for the pain that I have caused you people,"" he said. ""I'm sorry I can't bring everybody back. I wish things could have been a lot different.""

Wesbrook said he loved his daughter and all his supporters. ""I pray that the Lord take care of me and all of you,"" he said.

He concluded by telling relatives of his victims that he ""can understand your outrage and why you are mad at me. God be with all of us.""

As the lethal dose of the sedative pentobarbital took effect, he took two deep breaths, then began snoring. A few seconds later, all movement stopped. He was pronounced dead at 8:04 p.m. CST.

The execution was delayed about 90 minutes. Texas Department of Criminal Justice spokesman Jason Clark said prison officials had anticipated an additional appeal would be filed by a death penalty opponent whose appeal hours earlier was rejected by the Court of Criminal Appeals, the state's highest criminal court.

That appeal sought another review of claims that Wesbrook was mentally impaired and ineligible for the death penalty under U.S. Supreme Court rulings.

""Out of an abundance of caution, we waited, and when nothing was filed, we went forward (with the execution),"" Clark said.

Wesbrook killed his ex-wife, Gloria Jean Coons, 32; her roommate, Diana Ruth Money, 43; and three men: Antonio Cruz, 35, Anthony Ray Rogers, 41, and Kelly Hazlip, 28.

Wesbrook, a former security guard and delivery driver, married Coons in 1995. They divorced the following year but continued seeing each other. They had lunch Nov. 12, 1997, and talked about reconciling. That was on his mind when he showed up that night at her apartment in Channelview, just east of Houston. Instead, he found people partying.

He testified at his 1998 trial that Coons humiliated him by having sex with two of the men at the party while he was there. He said when he tried to leave, Cruz grabbed the keys to his truck and joined others in taunting him. He said he ""lost it,"" walked out, grabbed a rifle he kept in the truck and returned, shooting each person once. Coons was the final victim.

Court records show the five shots were fired within 40 seconds. Each victim was shot at close range.

Neighbors who heard the gunfire and called police saw Wesbrook emerge from the apartment, place the rifle inside his truck and stand calmly by the tailgate of the pickup to wait for sheriff's deputies to arrive.

""If I could change things and turn back time and bring all these people back and I could be in my right mind and not under the influence of any alcohol, none of this would have taken place,"" Wesbrook said recently from death row.

At least 10 other Texas inmates are scheduled to be executed in the coming months, including two later this month.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Move over Tesla: the fastest street-legal EV is now a Corvette Z06,[],"When you think of fast electric vehicles, the Tesla Model S and its ""Ludicrous Mode"" probably come to mind, and rightly so. With the equivalent of 762 horsepower in the Model S P90D and a 0 to 60 mph time of just 2.8 seconds, few supercars could even match the electric sedan's performance.

But what about top speed? That's been a tough nut to crack for electric vehicle manufacturers because while instant torque helps an EV rocket off the line, all that ""electric juice"" runs thin as the runway gets longer. That's where Genovation Cars comes in.

The EV tuner took a 2006 Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and turned it into the ""Genovation eXtreme Electric,"" or GXE for short. While testing the reborn 'vette at the Johnny Bohmer Proving Grounds/Shuttle Landing Facility in Florida, Genovation brought the sports car to a top speed of 186.8 mph. While even the regular Corvette can manage that feat these days, in the world of street-legal EVs, that figure is massive. In fact, it was nearly 10 mph quicker than the previous record holder at 177 mph.

Watch the video on Genovation's Facebook Page.

The new record was certified by the International Mile Racing Association and the vehicle has earned the official title of, ""Top Speed Street Legal Electric Car.""

The GXE capitalized on the Corvette Z06's light body as a platform to incorporate an innovative electric powertrain good for over 700 hp and 600 pound-feet of torque. Genovation claims the prototype has a 50:50 weight distribution and a range of 130 miles during ""normal driving operation."" I'm guessing drag racing doesn't fall under that category.

""We are thrilled that the result of our development testing led to the setting of this record. Based on our experience so far, we believe the car to be extremely robust as we set the record on our first day of testing,"" said Genovation CEO Andrew Saul. The company added that its work on the GXE isn't finished and it expects the EV to reach higher levels of performance very soon.",[]

Almost all of them celebrities in the world of politics. Only one had no chance to win -- according to the experts. He was thought of as a clown, politically incorrect, offensive, and had zero political experience at any level. Ninety-nine percent of the experts predicted hed never even file his financials with the FEC.

Surprise. Meet the winner of ""Celebrity Apprentice Special Political Edition"": Donald J. Trump.

As of Tuesday night Trump added Mississippi, Michigan and Hawaii to his trophy case. It wasnt even close. Trump dominated. And hes leading by a mile in the two remaining jewels needed to put this race away.

Trump leads Florida by a landslide over Florida Senator Marco Rubio. He has a commanding lead in Ohio over Ohio Governor Kasich.

How could the national media, political experts and commentators get it so wrong? The guy who never ran for office, let alone served in office, just beat out a mob of Washington insiders whove played the political game their entire lives.

Its almost as if Trump was toying with the entire political process. Its almost like it was a big game to him. It was almost as if he thought he was smarter than everyone else and he could play the game at a higher level. Almost.

Trump was the guy who supposedly only knew how to win a national television reality competition called Celebrity Apprentice. Heck, he designed the game. He produced the game. He sat in the boardroom and analyzed the tactics of the participants of the game. He crowned the winner among a mob of candidates each time.

Is it possible that Celebrity Apprentice was the perfect preparation for a presidential run? Is it possible Trump is smarter than all of us? Did he figure out that politics is exactly like a TV reality show competition? Did he design the perfect winning strategy based on Celebrity Apprentice?

Think about it. This political reality competition started with 17 contestants, a veritable Whos Who of national politics:

* 9 governors or former governors, including the Chairman of the Republican Governors Association: Chris Christie of New Jersey, John Kasich of Ohio, Jeb Bush of Florida, Jim Gilmore of Virginia, Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, George Pataki of New York, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Rick Perry of Texas.

* 5 Washington, D.C. U.S. Senate celebrities: United States Senators: Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Rick Santorum and Lindsey Graham.

*And three miscellaneous celebrities -- billionaire businessman Donald Trump; world-renowned brain surgeon and best-selling author Dr. Ben Carson; and businesswoman and CEO Carly Fiorina, a former CEO of Hewlett Packard and U.S. Senate candidate in California.

Today 16 contestants have gone dark. There is only one man left standing. There is no serious path to victory for anyone but Donald J. Trump -- the man who had never before played the Washington political game. The man who had never before run for office. The man who had never served a day in office. The man who ran his campaign without pollsters, strategists or consultants.

Experts called him crazy and extreme and unelectable.

Former GOP Presidential nominee Mitt Romney called him a fraud and conman.

Polls found he had the highest negatives of any candidate in modern political history.

Through it all he spent almost nothing. He ran the entire campaign on free media and his skills as the world's greatest branding expert.

And hes the one left standing. Hes the victor. Not by an inch. By a mile. Trump dominated.

Maybe its time to admit Trump is no dummy. Maybe Trump knew exactly what he was doing from day one. Maybe hes smarter than all the political experts in the media. Maybe hes smarter than all the political strategists and consultants in Washington D.C. Maybe hes smarter than all the politicians. Maybe he's just playing at a higher level than the rest of us.

Maybe he devised the perfect plan to win the ultimate grueling reality show competition- the race for President of the United States.

Its time to face the fact: Donald Trump will be the 2016 GOP presidential nominee. I hope Hillary Clinton is ready to play Celebrity Apprentice.

My prediction: Hillary doesnt have the skills to compete in this game.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Long a niche, street medicine for homeless heads mainstream",[],"They're house calls without the house.

Far from the sterile confines of a doctor's office or hospital, Brett Feldman looks for homeless people where they're most likely to be found - in wooded encampments, under bridges, along riverbanks, at soup kitchens - and treats them for ailments ranging from diabetes to trench foot, mental illness to substance abuse.

The 34-year-old physician assistant is one of the nation's few practitioners of ""street medicine,"" a tiny health care niche that advocates predict will become more mainstream as hospitals and health care systems seek to cut costs, in part by reducing emergency-room visits among the homeless.

Feldman's fledgling program is showing promise. His employer, the Lehigh Valley Health Network, about an hour north of Philadelphia, has seen the number of repeat visitors to the ER plummet. Feldman delivers primary and preventive care to about 100 homeless patients per month, treating them wherever they happen to be.

""My job is to bring comfort to them, and healing when I can,"" says Feldman, wearing a backpack filled with medical supplies and bundled up against the bitter cold as he makes rounds in the sister cities of Allentown, Bethlehem and Easton.

Street medicine got its start more than 30 years ago as an altruistic pursuit of individual doctors and nurses. In cities scattered around the country and the world, they left the office and headed outside to care for the chronically homeless, a population that is generally sicker and dies far younger than people with homes.

Until recently, though, relatively few of the 60 street medicine programs that operate nationwide have been affiliated with a hospital or health system. As health networks face increasing pressure to rein in costs, that could change.

Homeless people use the emergency room more often than the general population, stay longer and are readmitted at higher rates - a triple financial blow that's inflicting ""open wounds, bleeding wounds for hospitals,"" says Dr. Jim Withers, a street medicine pioneer who launched Pittsburgh Mercy's Operation Safety Net program in 1992.

Hospitals are ""probably the most front-line in terms of absorbing costs that a street medicine program would save them,"" says Withers, who co-founded the Street Medicine Institute in 2009. ""I think it's inevitable, but it hasn't happened yet. ... I think in the long run, it's going to be more cost-effective to be humane.""

Behind a shuttered Allentown nightclub, Feldman meets up with Todd Hottle, 53, an intermittently homeless farmhand who likely needs hernia surgery. Hottle tells Feldman he plans to leave the hospital immediately after the procedure - the quicker to return to his tent.

Feldman urges him to stay a few extra days to heal.

""Oh, man, I don't know. I really don't like that place,"" Hottle says, eliciting laughter from Feldman and his team. ""I don't like being locked up, penned up.""

Despite the good-natured grumbling, Hottle says he appreciates Feldman: ""He comes around and he checks out everybody, makes sure everybody's all right, brings down supplies. It's a good deal.""

It's a good deal for Feldman's employer, too. The street medicine program, which is funded by grant money, including a $200,000 award from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, has reduced 30-day readmission rates to Lehigh Valley Hospital from 51 percent to 13 percent. Moreover, Feldman and his team have been able to raise the rate of insured homeless from 24 percent to 73 percent, meaning the hospital gets paid more often for the care it provides.

""It seems to be keeping those crises down so they won't have to come in to the hospital, where it'll cost us in multiple times more,"" says Dr. Brian Nester, the health network's president and chief executive officer.

Other health systems with street medicine programs report similar benefits. The program at Mount Carmel Health System in Columbus, Ohio, diverts hundreds of costly emergency visits each month, says spokeswoman Samantha Irons. A street medicine program at JPS Health Network in Fort Worth, Texas, in combination with other initiatives, is likewise driving down ER utilization, says physician assistant Joel Hunt.

""We have something to offer that can be instantaneous, it can be tangible, they can learn something about themselves on the spot. You can zero in pretty quick with the right approach and gain people's trust,"" Hunt says.

Feldman became interested in street medicine as a student volunteering at a Chicago clinic. A homeless patient told him, 'You know, I didn't always like to be like this. I used to be somebody. And I used to have steak every night for dinner.'""

The conversation lit a fire under him. ""I didn't think that anybody should have to feel like that,"" Feldman says.

Street medicine, he says, represents the idea that ""everybody matters.""

After meeting with Hottle, Feldman hits several other homeless hotspots. Under one bridge, he finds blankets and sleeping bags, empty cans of malt liquor, a hospital wristband and an unopened bottle of medicine - all evidence of an active encampment - but no homeless.

Feldman collects some used hypodermic needles and deposits them in a container for medical waste, then drives to a shelter, where he sees Bridgete Hammerstone, 40, a recovering crack addict who has endured long stretches of homelessness.

""Someone like Brett is a blessing to me,"" she says, ""because he opens the door to allowing the light in for the first time in life, and it's real special.""",[]

We shouldnt hold our breath on repayment, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said in his opening statement at the hearing.

In some states, these losses will be absorbed by other insurance companieswhich means, by the policyholders of other insurance companies who have to pay increased ... premiums, he said. In other states, doctors, hospitals and individual patients stand to suffer large out-of-pocket losses due to the co-op failuresas our report details.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

Portmans statement, first obtained by Fox News, refers to an investigation by the committees majority staff.

It claims the most recent balance sheets provided to the subcommittee show the failed cooperatives owe more than $700 million to doctors and hospitals for plan year 2015.

The failed cooperatives lost $376 million and exceeded the projected worst-case-scenario losses outlined in their loan applications by more than $260 million in 2014. They lost an additional billion dollars in 2015, according to the report.

Once the co-ops got going in 2014, things went south in a hurryboth in terms of financial losses and enrollment figures that wildly deviated from the co-ops own projections, Portman said. Despite getting regular reports that the co-ops were hemorrhaging cash, HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] took essentially no corrective action for over a year.

Deloitte Consulting initially granted the cooperatives a passing grade based on an HHS-designed grading scale. However it added seven of the 12 had serious deficiencies in their enrollment strategy, according to the report. Others submitted budgets that were incomplete, unreasonable, not cost-effective and several relied on unreasonable projections about their own growth.

The report cited in Portmans statement also claims that from 20142015, the administration lent an additional $848 million to the failed cooperatives, as they lost more than $1.4 billion.

In previous testimony, administration officials have told congressional panels that the administration scrutinized cooperative business plans and then placed them on corrective oversight when necessary.

In 2015 we conducted 27 financial and operational reviews, 16 in-person visits, and had 43 formal communications, Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, told the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year. Not to mention hundreds of phone calls. And we've kept the states up to speed on every important interaction to help inform their regulatory actions.

When questioned how much money the government could salvage from the failed cooperatives, officials said they were only beginning to determine amounts.

We are in the process of recouping that loan money right now, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the chief operating officer and chief of staff of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, last month to a House panel. Well look at their excess revenue and then use all the tools available to us through their loan agreements and state and federal law to pull back federal tax dollars.

ObamaCare provided $2.4 billion in federal loans to establish 23 non-profit cooperatives. A dozen failed and the administration has required eight of the remaining eleven to adhere to a corrective action plan designed to fix business flaws and prevent additional failures. The closed cooperatives account for $1.2 billion in federal loans.

Defenders of the law and cooperatives say these non-profit insurers operated in difficult markets and that it often takes years of financial commitment to build a viable business.

The failed cooperatives left hundreds of thousands of customers searching for a new insurance company. In some states, the loss was significant.

HHS gave the New York co-op $90 million to prolong its financial life, rather than allow it to scale down, that co-op went on to lose another $544 million in 2015, according to Portmans statement, citing his staffs report.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner in the Democratic presidential delegate count, pledged she would address the market void left by the failed cooperatives.

We need to get more companies, more nonprofits, to fill this space. The ones that knew what they were doing have provided good services, but a lot of them have failed because they didn't have the right support, she said Monday at a Democratic presidential forum hosted by Fox News.

Even in those markets where those co-ops had previously operated, we have seen a commitment on the part of those who are administering the markets to try to facilitate greater competition, said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. And creating the co-ops was just one way to do that, but we certainly are going to be open to other ways to encourage other entities, private or public, to get engaged in this process.

When previously questioned by Congress, administration officials declined to forecast how many of the remaining cooperatives would survive this year.

The co-ops themselves are really the ones who are going to be the ones to determine whether or not they ultimately will be successful, said Cohen. They have a lot of work to do to rapidly mature their entities, their small businesses as you know and theyre still getting their foothold on this business.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Obama takes heat for skipping Nancy Reagan's funeral for festival,[],"President Obama once again is facing criticism for planning to skip the funeral of a prominent conservative figure, with the president expected to attend a festival over the services Friday for former first lady Nancy Reagan.

Michelle Obama plans to attend the funeral in Simi Valley, California, but the president will instead be in Austin, Texas, for the South by Southwest (SXSW) festival, a popular interactive mash-up of music, tech and film.

Obama is set to deliver a keynote speech.

Obamas decision immediately drew fire from some conservatives, with former 2012 Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann calling the move self-centered and classless.

Self-centered, classless Obama misses another funeral of a high profile conservative. https://t.co/oKKXE5iOtz  Michele Bachmann (@MicheleBachmann) March 9, 2016

The controversy comes after Obama chose not to attend the funeral of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia in February  a move that was heavily criticized by many on the right.

KT McFarland, former Defense official in the Reagan administration and a Fox News national security analyst, knocked Obama on Twitter for skipping the funerals of Nancy Reagan, Scalia and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

That's petty, petulant & lowclass, she wrote.

Democratic presidential candidate and former first lady Hillary Clinton, as well as former President George W. Bush, plan to attend.

Obama, though, hardly is setting a precedent by missing the funeral of a former first lady.

The Clintons did not attend the funeral of Pat Nixon in 1993. In 2007, President George W. Bush did not attend the funeral of Lady Bird Johnson, though he had no scheduled events that day.

And in 2011, Obama did not attend the funeral of former first lady Betty Ford.

President Carter also did not attend the funeral of Mamie Eisenhower in 1979, while President Reagan did not attend the funeral of Bess Truman in 1982.



But presidents have attended such services in other cases.

President John F. Kennedy attended the funeral of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's widow, Eleanor Roosevelt, in 1962. When Jacquelyn Kennedy died in 1994, President Bill Clinton and then-first lady Hillary Clinton attended.

The Obamas still paid tribute to Mrs. Reagan on Monday, saying she had ""redefined the role"" of first lady and praising her advocacy for those suffering from Alzheimers.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,'Grey's Anatomy's' Maggie and DeLuca's relationship will 'take an unexpected turn',[],"[Spoiler alert! The following contains spoilers from ""Grey's Anatomy""]

Maggie (Kelly McCreary) and Andrew (Giacomo Gianniotti) may hit the first bump in the road of their relationship on Thursday's episode of ""Grey's Anatomy,"" when the pressure of keeping their romance under wraps starts to become an issue.

""We've seen so far, with Maggie and DeLuca, that they've not been very successful at keeping their relationship a secret,"" McCreary tells TVGuide.com. ""I'll just say that the stress of that sort of starts to bear down on DeLuca in particular, and they're faced with a reality check about what they're doing.""

Adds Gianniotti: ""Something happens that makes them both sort of solidify their stance on how they feel about the relationship.""

'Grey's Anatomy's' Sarah Drew: There's a ""tremendous sense of hope"" for Jackson and April

McCreary points out that Maggie and Andrew's relationship - if we can even call it that at this point -- happened almost by accident, and both may find themselves in over their heads.

""I think this whole thing snuck up on Maggie,"" McCreary says. ""What's been fun to play is watching her enjoy it, and not try to run away from it. She's certainly trying to keep things compartmentalized, and [faces] the challenges that human beings face when they try to be so in control of every part of their lives.""

Suffice it to say, even though Maggie and Webber (James Pickens Jr.) have reached a tacit understanding about her relationship with Andrew, Andrew's still reeling from the revelation that he's essentially sleeping with his boss' daughter. Had he known that from the beginning, he may not have pursued a relationship with Maggie, Gianniotti notes.

""That was a huge blow for Andrew,"" Gianniotti says. ""That adds a whole other layer of complications and that's not what he signed up for. I think him getting this deep and then finding that out was a little bit hard for him, because it sort of adds a whole other layer of pressure. ... Obviously, because the time has passed, he is deeply invested in Maggie, so he's not at the point where he's willing to throw that all to the wind just because of that. However, yes, it's a very different terrain now that he's navigating with this knowledge.""

VIDEO: How well do the stars of 'Grey's Anatomy' know medical jargon?

And on Maggie's side, she's worried about what a nonprofessional relationship with an underling will do to her reputation - though, of course, such a dynamic is hardly unusual at Grey Sloan. ""I think Maggie's personal problem with it has to do with her experience of always being the youngest and the smallest and having to work really hard to be taken seriously as a professional,"" McCreary says. ""She doesn't realize how accepted she is at the hospital, and respected. As far as I can tell, she doesn't realize that that's not at stake for her here. She's finally in a place where she's established as a leader, and can relax in that position. But she doesn't know that, because that hasn't been her experience.""

Though they share similar hesitations (as well as a history of being unlucky in love), Maggie and Andrew find themselves at odds in Thursday's episode, and they come to a surprising decision as a result.

""They're out of sync in tonight's episode, and there is a little bit of a problem because of it,"" McCreary hints. ""It definitely takes an unexpected turn, which I don't think fans will see coming.""",[]

Under House Bill 4, also known as the Parent Involvement and Accountability Act, teachers would be required to grade parents involvement with their childrens education.

The legislation, by state Rep. Gregory Holloway (D-Hazlehurst), would mandate a section be added to each childs report card on which the parents are graded on their responsiveness to communication with teachers, the students completion of homework and readiness for tests, and the frequency of absences and tardiness.

Mary Clare Reim, research associate on education at the Heritage Foundation, said the bill is the wrong way to encourage more parental involvement.

My initial reaction is, this is absurd, Reim said. The concept that parents should be graded by teachers on their involvement is a reversal of what the education system should look like. Parents should be grading teachers on their performance. Putting grades on parental involvement from the top down is not the way this should work.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Trump says GOP opposition to him 'taking advantage of our country',[],"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump pushed back Wednesday night against what appears to be a growing movement among the party establishment  including a few of his former rivals  to at least slow down his march to the convention with enough delegates in hand to claim the nomination.

Speaking with Sean Hannity on a special Fox News town hall, Trump accused GOP lawmakers opposed to his campaign of ""taking advantage of our country.""



The billionaire businessman called his campaign a movement ""of competence and common sense and low taxes and [secure] borders and it would be so foolish to give it away.""

Trump was referring to a conference held by the conservative American Enterprise Institute at Sea Island off the coast of Georgia over the weekend, where one of the topics reportedly was stopping Trump from securing the Republican nomination.

The conference reportedly was attended by Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other key Republican congressmen.

""I know all these people,"" Trump told Hannity. ""These are people that are taking advantage of our country. They dont want to have strong borders. They want stuff flowing across the borders. They dont want to have taxation when countries treat us unfairly because they benefit from that.""

""Politicians will do whats right for the people that gave them the money,"" Trump added later, ""not what's right for the country.""

Former GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush also planned to meet with Trump's rivals on Thursday ahead of a GOP debate in Florida, fueling speculation that he's preparing to endorse a candidate challenging Trump.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, meanwhile, told Fox News that he would not drop out of the Republican presidential race before next week's Florida primary, saying, ""we're gonna fight this thing through Tuesday ... and we're going to go on.""

Rubio denied multiple reports that he had discussed the possibility of dropping out before the winner-take-all contest.

Speaking with Fox News Megyn Kelly, Rubio said: ""I have never discussed dropping out with anyone on my team, or anyone on the planet Earth ... I'm the only one who can beat Donald Trump in Florida.

A Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Rubio trailing Trump by 23 percentage points among likely Republican voters in Florida.

""I honestly dont believe Donald Trump will be the nominee,"" Rubio said. ""I continue to believe it's going to be me, and it's got to start here in Florida.""

Rubio also dismissed the possibility that he would form a so-called ""unity"" Republican ticket with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump's closest challenger in the delegate race, calling it "" the kind of drama that makes it interesting in TV to speculate about.""

""At some point we're all going to team up,"" Rubio said in reference to the non-Trump candidates. ""We're all going to be on the same team, I hope.

Cruz told Kelly that Rubio and Kasich were ""good, honorable people, but neither of them has a path to the nomination.""

""Head-to-head, not only do I beat Donald Trump,"" Cruz said, ""but I defeat him resoundingly.""

Cruz also walked back his earlier opposition to a possible convention fight between himself and Trump if neither man reaches the required 1,237 delegates during the primaries.

""Look, [Ronald] Reagan and [President Gerald] Ford battled it out at a contested convention [in 1976],"" Cruz said. ""That's what conventions are for."" However, Cruz restated his opposition to a so-called brokered convention, calling it ""a fever dream of the D.C. establishment"" and warning of ""an open revolt"" among Republican voters if it came to pass.

Cruz later turned his rhetorical fire against Trump and Rubio over immigration reform and the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" bill in 2013.

""When Marco Rubio stood with Barack Obama and [Sen.] Chuck Schumer and [then-Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid ... I stood with millions of Americans,"" Cruz told Kelly. ""Not only was Donald Trump nowhere to be found, he was funding the Gang of Eight. He gave $50,000 to five of its members.""

Cruz also accused Rubio of lowering the tone of the campaign, saying, ""I have no views whatsoever on any part of Donald Trumps anatomy,"" an apparent reference to Rubio jabbing Trump's ""small hands"" at a Virginia campaign stop.

For his part, Rubio told Megyn Kelly that he regretted the remark, saying ""my kids were embarrassed by it, my wife didnt like it, I dont think it reflects [well]; thats not who I am.""

Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has staked his campaign's future on victory in next Tuesday's Ohio primary, told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren that he would ""probably not"" pick up enough delegates in other contests to overtake Trump, but noted that voters had only ""picked about half the delegates [so far] this year ... anything is possible.""

A Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Kasich leading Trump by five percentage points among likely Republican voters in the Buckeye State.

""We're going to win Ohio,"" Kasich told Van Susteren. ""That's not even a question for me. It's about what we do after that and all the places we have to go. But we're not taking it for granted.""

Trump has 458 delegates to Cruz's 359 following Tuesday's contests, in which Trump won the Mississippi and Michigan primaries as well as the Hawaii caucus. Cruz also picked up a win in the Idaho primary. Rubio is a distant third with 151 delegates, while Kasich has 54.",[]

Just a few weeks ago, there were calls for Ted Cruz to drop out of the race and join Marco Rubio for a united ticket, but now the calls are going the opposite way -- for Rubio to drop out and join forces with Cruz.

A candidate only has a path forward on the GOP side if they can realistically see reaching the magic number of 1237 delegates, and right now it appears Cruz may be the only one who can accomplish it besides Donald Trump.

Add to it -- these hypothetical head to head match ups. Cruz beats Trump 57 percent to 40 percent. So does Kasich. Rubio also beats Trump -- but by a lesser margin, 56 percent to 43 percent.

Over the next few days the big question will be whether Rubio or Kasich will make a move before their home states of Florida and Ohio next Tuesday. Remember Donald Trump wins the nomination if he wins both of those states, but chances Rubio or Kasich falls on the sword to help Cruz? I just don't see it happening.

Rivers state is a stronghold of the opposition Democrats. The party denies responsibility and blames the spate of killings over two weeks on ""satanic cult clashes,"" according to state government spokesman Austin Tam George, who is also an official of the Democrats party. He accused the governing party of ""reckless and false allegations"" to destabilize the opposition administration.

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Payments Firm Square Notes Path To Profit,[],"Payments provider Square said Wednesday that it was on the path to profitability.



In its first presentation as a public company, the 7-year-old San Francisco company also said that it continues to lose money. Net losses grew to $48 million in the fourth quarter from $37 million a year earlier.



Run by Twitter Inc. founder and Chief Executive Jack Dorsey and known for the small white payment devices it sells to small businesses, Square has been the subject of intense focus since its initial public offering late last year. Square's confidence could help stem the growing tide of pessimism about Silicon Valley as startups deal with lower valuations and skittish markets.



Square said that sales continue to grow rapidly. With the volume of payments processed hitting a record $10.2 billion in the quarter, Square's revenue expanded to $374 million, topping analysts' forecast of $344 million. Revenue rose 49% from last year.



The faster revenue growth led Square to project that it could earn as much as $12 million in earnings on a adjusted basis this year, which takes out costs such as taxes and stock compensation, a measure the company says gives a clearer sense of its performance. Analysts had been forecasting a profit on that basis of $7 million for 2016.



Mr. Dorsey, Square's co-founder and chief executive, said that the company will continue to invest in the business, especially as it bets that a consumer shift from using credit cards to paying with mobile phones, such as with Apple Inc.'s Apple Pay app, will drive more businesses to start using Square's terminals.



Square's hardware sales more than doubled to $16 million in 2015, as it shipped its new payment devices. That came with accelerating hardware costs as well, to $31 million from $18 million in 2014, as Square spends to develop and distribute the new devices that work with contactless mobile-phone apps and ""chip"" cards with enhanced security features. Mr. Dorsey boasted that Square had built superfast devices for accepting chip cards and smartphone swipes.



""We're taking full advantage of the shift, and we'll continue to make the right choices to ensure we continue to grow,"" he said in an interview. ""There's a real opportunity to associate our logo with, 'I can pay with my phone here.'""



Mr. Dorsey is personally under scrutiny as much as Square, due to his dual roles as CEO of Square and of Twitter, which he returned to run last year as the social network struggles to reverse a decline in its share price.



Square went public last November at $9 a share, well below where it had raised money privately in 2014 at $15.46.



Lately, however, Square's shares have turned around. Square shares have rallied 40% in the past month to $12.03 at Wednesday's close. After the earnings news, shares rose as much as 4% in aftermarket trading.

Theyre not animals, of course. Theyre those bits of truck tires strewn across Americas highways. They're often the tragic result of tires that werent operating at optimal air pressure, which is hard to maintain on a tractor trailer carrying various loads over hundreds or even thousands of miles through large temperature swings.

Related Image Expand / Contract (Michelin)

Two years ago, a California startup named Aperia Technologies began selling a solution to this problem: the hub-mounted Halo Tire Inflator. Similar to a self-winding watch, it uses a pendulum-type weight to power a pump as the wheel its attached to turns. Set to a specific pressure, the device is connected to the tires valve stem via a hose and automatically increases or reduces pressure as needed. One Halo can serve up to two tires.

Related Image Expand / Contract (Michelin)

Along with preventing blowouts and increasing tire life, it improves fuel economy and reduces downtime for repairs, all of which adds up to $2,400 annual savings per truck, according to Aperia.

Thats exactly what it costs to install on an 18-wheeler, but its compatible with buses and heavy duty trucks with fewer axles, too. Aperia has sold thousands of systems since 2014 as it has built up its distribution network, but now its teaming up with Michelin to expand its reach dramatically.

The tire giant has begun offering the co-branded AutoInflate powered by Halo through its commercial services network for a monthly lease of about $15 a pop, and Aperia CEO Josh Carter expects its adoption to explode as it stops more tires from doing just that.

Carter says the company is focused on developing its U.S. market reach, but is also conducting several pilot programs overseas and has started looking into making a version for cars and light duty trucks.

And while a big selling point for the Halo is that it can be retrofitted to pretty much any truck, emissions rules being written for heavy duty trucks could include a bonus for the use of such systems, which would make them appealing to original equipment manufacturers, as well.

As for those gators, enjoy  and avoid  them while they last.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,German police believe ISIS files are legitimate,[],"Germany's federal criminal police said Thursday they are in possession of files containing personal data on members of the extremist Islamic State group and believe them to be authentic.

The announcement came after Britain's Sky News reported it had obtained 22,000 Islamic State files on the border with Turkey and Syria, files that detail ISIS fighters' real names, where they were from, telephone numbers, and even names of those who sponsored and recruited the militants.

Though the significance of these files is yet to be gauged, they could be the largest yet treasure trove of documents found on ISIS and the most significant leak on its past and present fighters and operations across the Mideast.

They could also shape the campaign against the extremist group, which emerged from Al Qaeda in Iraq. The cache, exposing its members and their families, could undermine its future ability to recruit and inspire would-be members.

US Army Col. Steve Warren, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State, said the information could help the coalition fight the Islamic State group by aiding in a crack-down on ISIS's foreign fighter networks.

He said that while he was not able to verify the documents, he hoped that ""if there is a media outlet that has these names and numbers, I hope they publish them."" This would help bring attention to the problem of foreign fighters joining ISIS, and would help law enforcement crack down on the problem, he said.

""This would allow the law enforcement apparatus across the world to become much more engaged and begin to help do what we can to stem this flow of foreign fighters  so we're hopeful that its accurate and if so we certainly plan to do everything we can to help,"" he said.

Sky said the files were passed on to them on a memory stick stolen from the head of Islamic State's internal security police by a former fighter who had grown disillusioned with the group.

Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported it had also obtained ""dozens"" of similar files on the Turkey-Syria border, where it said Islamic State files and videos were widely available from anti-ISIS Kurdish fighters and also members of the Islamic State group itself.

A spokeswoman for Germany's Bundeskriminalamt, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter with the media, said her agency is currently evaluating the files. She declined to say where the agency obtained the files, how many documents are involved and how long it has had them.

Sky reported that the documents are a collection of forms filled out by recruits when they were inducted into the Islamic State. The forms have 23 questions and include nationals from at least 51 countries, Sky reported.

Germany's Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told the dpa news agency that the material would give authorities a better chance to track down and prosecute people who had fought with ISIS.

The material also seems to have the potential to help authorities crack recruitment networks in Europe and elsewhere that have been sending fighters to join the Islamic State group, which has seized large swaths of land in Syria and Iraq and declared a self-styled caliphate on the territory under its control.

There are no clear estimates of how many Islamic State fighters there are in Iraq and Syria, but the numbers range between 30,000 and 100,000. A CIA assessment in late 2014 put the number of ISIS fighters at around 31,500.

Three people drowned in Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana.

In Bienville Parish, authorities said a man died and a woman was being treated for injuries after their car was swept off a flooded Louisiana road Wednesday and into a creek. In rural southeastern Oklahoma, a 30-year-old man drowned Tuesday night after trying to drive his SUV across a low-crossing bridge covered by floodwater. In Texas, a 22-year-old man drowned Monday night after his canoe capsized in Dickinson Bayou, southeast of Houston near Galveston Bay.

In Bossier City, 3,500 homes were evacuated as a precaution because a bayou was approaching the top of its levee. National Weather Service meteorologist Jason Hansford said Thursday morning that the bayou may top the levee or be breached.

Heavy rain continued across much of north Louisiana on Wednesday night and early Thursday morning with another 3 inches, Hansford said.

State police report several sections of Interstate 20 were closed from Bossier City to near Gibsland in north central Louisiana.

The forecast is for the rain to end by Friday afternoon. Flash flood watches remained in effect for areas from Port O'Connor, Texas, to near Springfield, Illinois.

Air Force Tech Sgt. Drew Scott and another military friend brought in a boat Wednesday to help evacuate up to 200 mobile homes in the Pecan Valley Estates community in Bossier Parish. Scott said he had gone in his truck earlier Wednesday to pick up his in-laws but couldn't get into the park.

""Water, coming up from the Flat River, was waist deep or higher and going into the houses. There were lots of cars flooded out. At the deepest point, I'd say, it was up to my chest and I'm 6 feet,"" he said.

Scott said he and his friend assisted the sheriff's office, firefighters and others in getting those who were stranded out of harm's way.

""When things like this happen, people start helping others and that helps restore faith in the country and humanity,"" he said. ""That's the way I was raised and the way I raise my family. I would hope that if the shoe was on the other foot and I needed help that someone would do the same for me.""

Sharon Anderson, her three children and four grandchildren were rescued from her south Bossier Parish mobile home after rising water threatened to trap them. Several other families already had been trapped, and the water was still rising, she said.

""This morning it was touching the bottom of the houses,"" she said. ""Now the steps on my back porch are under water, and if you walk down the driveway, it's over the knee.""

Anderson said they were pretty much surrounded by the water. The road into the area is flooded and another outlet that has a bridge is closed because of water.

""We're literally trapped,"" Anderson said. ""You have to get a boat to get to our doors in this neighborhood.""

Several Louisiana parishes have declared a state of emergency, and the National Guard was sent in to help.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards issued the order affecting Acadia, Bienville, Bossier, Caddo, Claiborne, Desoto, East Carroll, Grant, Lincoln, Morehouse, Ouachita, Red River, Richland, Union, Webster and West Carroll parishes after nearly a foot of rain fell Tuesday night and Wednesday.

Louisiana State Police closed a section of Interstate 20 near Gibsland after both the eastbound and westbound lanes were covered with a foot of water, making the road impassible.

Meteorologist Matthew Duplantis of the National Weather Service in Shreveport said Wednesday rain brought an additional 2 to 4 inches to the area.

Northwestern State University's campuses in Natchitoches and Shreveport will be closed Thursday due to weather conditions, as are Bossier Parish public schools.

Over southeast Louisiana, including the New Orleans metro area, forecasters say the slow-moving low pressure system was expected to bring a few rounds of heavy rainfall beginning Thursday morning and continue through early Saturday.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Can cousin of marijuana plant ease NFL's concussion problem?,[],"Former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon calls himself ""old school,"" including his use of marijuana both during and after his career.

Yet McMahon's stab at self-medicating could be ahead of its time. Researchers at Johns Hopkins plan to test whether a compound found in hemp  and its notorious cousin, cannabis  proves as effective in treating brain injuries as testimonials claim.

Some former players believe cannabidiol, or CBD, could help millions who suffer brain injuries each year, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease caused by repeated concussions and found in many former NFL players whose brains have been autopsied.

""I don't think any of us regret what we did,"" said Jake Plummer, who played 10 seasons before retiring in 2007. ""But there's no question it comes at a real cost.""

Along with a handful of other retired players, Plummer felt strongly enough about the benefits of using CBD to appear in a public-service campaign titled ""When the Bright Lights Fade."" It was sponsored by Realm of Caring, a nonprofit research organization and CW Botanicals, a dietary supplements company specializing in hemp products. It was released Wednesday as part of National Brain Injury Awareness month with the goal of raising $100,000 to begin the Johns Hopkins study.

""I've had friends, guys I played alongside, whose mood changed from night to day. I know others who've replaced hellacious amounts of painkillers with CBD ... and I hope this gets even more guys involved,"" Plummer said. ""The bigger the number, the better chance we have to get in front of (NFL commissioner) Roger Goodell and say, 'You need to fund this.' Not just for football players, but for the millions of others it could help.""

Because of a lack of research and varying federal and state regulations, the science and the law on CBD are far from settled. Major medical organizations have not supported marijuana to treat concussions, but many also say what the U.S. government patent on cannabinoids, including CBD, states: They act as ""neuroprotectants"" and have shown to be effective at limiting damage in cases of stroke or trauma and to treat degenerative diseases.

Versions of the CBD compound are available in some stores and online in creams, pills and oils. Some claim to be rich in CBD, with little or no THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive agent that produces a ""high."" At least one manufacturer says its CBD product won't trip a positive NFL drug test. According to the Food and Drug Administration, none are approved for the ""diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.""

But in the last three years, encouraged by a CNN documentary on medical marijuana, thousands of parents whose children's diagnoses range from autism to epilepsy mounted a Facebook campaign to sing its praises. They were soon joined by adults suffering from cancer or Parkinson's disease. Many reported better pain management, impactful mood changes and significant decreases in seizures. Some families even relocated to Colorado to use CBD legally.

""Imagine if we'd suddenly found a plant extract in the Amazon that was as effective as CBD seems to be ... and it was non-psychoactive, non-addictive and non-toxic, and had none of the stigma attached to it that marijuana does. We'd be all over it,"" said Joel Stanley, co-founder of CW Botanicals and the eldest of six brothers working in the family's medical marijuana business in Colorado. ""We think we already have it.""

They began growing medical marijuana in 2009 and soon after produced a strain they called ""Hippie's Disappointment,"" because it was high in CBD but low in THC. There was no market for it until 2012, when Page Figli, whose 5-year-old daughter Charlotte suffered from intractable epilepsy, came searching for CBD-rich oil. Soon after using it, according to her parents. Charlotte's seizures dropped from hundreds per day to almost none. The Stanleys, who said their waiting list for treatment once numbered 12,000 families, renamed the strain Charlotte's Web.

""I can't think of a better, safer thing to look at helping players dealing with a range of injuries and pain,"" Stanley said. ""They're already pumping dangerous pills into these guys like it's candy.""

McMahon, 56, has been diagnosed with early onset dementia and struggles with many of the attendant symptoms: depression, memory loss, vision and speech impairment and severe headaches. He says medical marijuana  he still prefers a high THC strain  helped him kick a 100-Percocet-a-month habit to cope with the lingering pain in his shoulders, neck and arms after a 15-year NFL career.

At a ""Cannabis and Athletics"" panel late last month, McMahon said he smoked marijuana with his Super Bowl-winning teammates often enough that coach Mike Ditka referred to the group as ""You pot smokers.""

""We'd say, 'It's better than being drunk out here,"" McMahon told the Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram. ""We're still functioning.'""

Though there are no reliable surveys, many NFL players have estimated half the players or more used marijuana, including many more interested in pain management than the buzz.

""Safety is not just while you're playing, it's what happens after you walk away from the game, too,"" said Baltimore Ravens tackle Eugene Monroe, one of the few active players taking part in the fundraising effort.

Monroe does not use CBD. He got interested in the research after seeing the CNN documentary and befriending a doctor whose autistic child had frequent seizures. Conversations with fellow players have heightened that interest.

""I saw where commissioner Goodell said the NFL would consider it, if the science is there to back it up,"" Monroe said. ""Well, here's their chance to get involved. Let's take a look at whether and how this can benefit our players. We're talking about funding medical research, not about smoking pot.""",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Source of blood infection linked to 15 deaths in Wisconsin unclear,[],"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has sent additional investigators to Wisconsin to find the source of a blood infection that officials described as the largest outbreak of the bacteria now linked to at least 15 deaths.

Wisconsin health officials said on their website Wednesday that the total number of reported cases now stands at 48. Infections were centered in the heavily populated southeastern quarter of the state, including the Milwaukee area and surrounding suburban counties.

Infectious disease specialists expect more infections to be found because health care providers and laboratories have been alerted to look for the bacterium called Elizabethkingia. It is named for Elizabeth O. King, a CDC bacteriologist who studied meningitis in infants.

Health officials initially reported the bacterium had been tied to 18 deaths, but the state Department of Health Services revised that figure to 15 late Wednesday afternoon. Agency officials said they couldn't confirm that one person with Elizabethkingia had died and received duplicative and incorrect reports from various sources. They stressed that it's not clear whether the infection caused the deaths.

A team of eight disease investigators, including three recently dispatched from the CDC, worked with the state Department of Health Services to interview those infected in 11 southern counties to see if a common source of Elizabethkingia could be found.

""We want to get through all of the basic information when memories are still fresh and they remember what they've eaten and where they've been,"" said Michael Bell, the CDC's deputy director of Healthcare Quality Promotion.

The organism is common in the environment, including water and soil, but it rarely causes infections, Bell said Wednesday. And because the cases tested so far come from the same genetic ""fingerprint,"" investigators looked for a common source, he added.

Bell said the Wisconsin cases are the largest outbreak of Elizabethkingia recorded in published literature.

""This is essentially ten-fold in what we expect to see"" generally, Bell said.

A variety of potential sources have been tested, including health care products, water sources and food, but none of these have been found to be a source of the bacteria, said Bell whose division is working with Wisconsin health officials.

The majority of patients infected are 65 or older with a history of at least one underlying serious illness, according to the state health department. Those who died all tested positive for the infection, but it's not known if Elizabethkingia caused or contributed to their deaths.

Dr. Nasia Safdar, University of Wisconsin-Madison associate professor of infectious disease, said she has seen sporadic cases of the infection since she began studying diseases in 2003, but nothing like this.

""It's strange in that so many people are involved. It's a large outbreak for this type of bacteria,"" she said.

Generally, each state sees about five to 10 cases of the bacteria per year, according to the CDC. Safdar said it was likely additional cases will be found because health care providers and labs are now more vigilant since the outbreak was initially reported.

Not all of those infected have recently been in the hospital, where it would typically be transmitted through a device or equipment such as a contaminated sink used by numerous people, Safdar said.

""Usually it would be in a hospital setting where a susceptible population would exist,"" she added.

In the health care setting, the bacteria has been isolated in hospital water supplies, sinks, saline solution used for flushing procedures, disinfectants, and medical devices, including feeding tubes, arterial catheters, and respirators, according to the Indian Journal of Critical Care Medicine.

The organism can survive in chlorine-treated municipal water supplies, often colonizing sink basins and taps, intubation tubes, humidifiers, incubators for newborns, ice chests and syringes, and has become a potential reservoir for infections in the hospital environment.

State health officials were first notified of six cases between Dec. 29, 2015, and Jan. 4, 2016, and alerted health care providers and laboratories statewide of the presence of the bacteria.

After the initial cases were reported and state health officials notified local partners, the number of cases began to grow steadily with one dating back to November 2015. Symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, chills or skin rash, health officials said.",[]

Not only does he have time to spend on any number of philanthropic endeavors, he's also not shy about engaging in a Reddit AMA every now and again.

That said, Gates on Tuesday afternoon returned to Reddit for the fourth time where he answered questions on a whole host of topics, including the FBI's ongoing legal battle with Apple, how he used to skip class while he was a student at Harvard, and much more.

DON'T MISS: Ex-boyfriend brilliantly trolls woman who won't return iPhone he gave her as a gift

With respect to the mobile encryption issue that Apple and the FBI are currently embroiled in, Gates took a middle of the road approach when asked for his take on the issue.

""I think there needs to be a discussion about when the government should be able to gather information,"" Gates answered. ""What if we had never had wiretapping? Also the government needs to talk openly about safeguards. Right now a lot of people don't think the government has the right checks to make sure information is only used in criminal situations. So this case will be viewed as the start of a discussion. I think very few people take the extreme view that the government should be blind to financial and communication data but very few people think giving the government carte blanche without safeguards makes sense. A lot of countries like the UK and France are also going through this debate. For tech companies there needs to be some consistency including how governments work with each other. The sooner we modernize the laws the better.""

When asked what he would do if he found himself in Apple's position, Gates answered: ""Maybe they could propose an overall plan for striking the balance between government being able to know things in some cases and having safeguards to make sure those powers are confined to appropriate cases. There is no avoiding this debate and they could contribute to how the balance should be struck.""

Of course, the entirety of the AMA wasn't exclusively devoted to serious topics. For instance, when asked what his fondest memory from Harvard was, Gates recalled a rather amusing story.

I decided that I would be different and never attend any class I was signed up for but always attend a class I wasn't signed up for. This worked out in a funny way when the final exam for a Combinatorics class (which I signed up for) was given at the same table as my Brain studies class (which I attended and did not sign up for). My friends from Brain studies thought it was very strange that I sat on the wrong side of the table and took the Combinatorics exam even when I was the most vocal student in the Brain class.

When asked how he was able to make this work, given that he was taking an exam for a class he never attended, Gates added:

I studied super hard during reading period and almost always got A's. The big exception was organic chemistry where the promised video tapes of the lectures sometimes had no sound or no video -- that spooked me and I ended up getting a C+ in the course!

Oh that Gates, always tough to keep tabs on that guy. And truth be told, a C+ in organic chemistry without attending any classes is impressive in its own right.

When asked for his thoughts on what the next biggest advancement in technology will be over the next two decades, Gates said that robots with vision ""and manipulation as good as humans"" will be something that will achieved within a 10-year window. Gates further added that ""medical advances will also be amazing and unbelievable.""

As for what type of technological advancements scare Gates, the Microsoft founder said that biological tools would certainly pose a threat should they wind up in the wrong hands.

Some other notable tidbits from the AMA include:

Gates believes Pirates of Silicon Valley "" was a reasonable recapitulation of the early days of the PC industry.""

was a reasonable recapitulation of the early days of the PC industry."" Gates always uses the latest version of Windows, hardly a shocker.

Programming was the most useful thing Gates ever learned. ""I was obsessed with programming from age 14 to 19 and that is a good time to keep trying to improve.""

Here's a sampling of the amazing solar eclipse snapshots we found in our mail today.

NASA tracked the solar eclipse from Micronesia, capturing stunning video of the moon blocking the sun, and many other eclipse-chasers also had their cameras ready for the event. One veteran astrophotographer, Justin Ng of Singapore, put together an awesome collage of eclipse phases (below) from photographs he took in Palu, Indonesia, while leading a team of eight first-time eclipse photographers. It was Ng's first time as well, and the eclipse proved challenging compared to his usual night-sky targets. But the experience, he said, was unforgettable.

""Moments before the totality, I could feel the drastic change in temperature (it became cooler), and my guess would be at least a 5-7 degree Celsius [9 to 13 degrees F] difference,"" Ng said in an email. ""During the totality, the scene turned darker, and I was able to see the sun's corona with my eyes! It's akin to seeing a 'black hole' in the sky, and everything was so surreal and unbelievable."" Plus, Ng was able to spot Venus and Mercury during totality. [See more photos of the 2016 total solar eclipse]

Matt Skinner wasn't in a location to see the total solar eclipse, but he managed to document the partial solar eclipse visible from Anchorage, Alaska. He was a first-time eclipse photographer as well, and it was actually the first time he managed to see an eclipse clearly at all.

""The clouds were thick throughout much of Anchorage, but I was lucky enough to find a spot where the sun showed itself for about 20 minutes or so,"" Skinner told Space.com in an email. ""The mountains and the light refracting off of the water were bonuses for me, as I had only intended to capture the eclipse.""

After his first eclipse experience, he's ready for more  particularly, the U.S.-spanning total solar eclipse coming up in August 2017, he said.

Akash Anandh snagged this shot with a telephoto lens on his camera, and also photographed the eclipse through a telescope that was available for viewing at the National University of Singapore, he told Space.com.

Vincent Tan (darthcryder) ran across the solar eclipse while on a photo walk with a friend, unexpectedly catching this beautiful view of an airplane in silhouette.

And Ben Ali Tolentino caught this view of the eclipse in projection from the Philippines.

NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center invited everyone to submit photos of the eclipse on Flickr, and highlighted some additional spectacular views.

Most of the United States missed a glimpse of this eclipse, but American readers can get ready to flex their astrophotography muscles next year, when a total solar eclipse will cross the United States and offer full or partial views nationwide.

That has got to be the lament within the wreckage of the Republican establishment after Donald Trump won Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii after enduring nearly two weeks of political carpet-bombing.

There was criticism by everyone from Romney to Ryan, harsh rhetoric from his rivals and Super PAC attack ads, along with comparisons to Nixon and David Duke from the #NeverTrump wing of the media. And yet Trump still rolled to victory in three of the four states voting Tuesday.

Ted Cruz managed to win the Idaho caucuses, Marco Rubio had another terrible night as he ponders a last stand in Florida, and John Kasich had a respectable finish in Michigan that he hopes to parlay into a win in Ohio.

But politicians winning their home states is a pittance compared to what Trump, against all odds, is managing to pull off. To carry his first industrial Midwest state, while also winning easily in a Deep South state, shows the breadth of his appeal.

The media chatter heading into Tuesday was all about whether Trump had peaked. The attacks were changing the tone of the campaign, the national polls were tightening, and he lost two out of four states to Cruz over the weekend (both caucus states, where the senators superior organization gives him an edge).

More pundits started writing about how Trump would fall short of the required 1,237 delegates and how the party could snatch away the nomination in Cleveland.

So why did Trump do so well?

As he noted at his news conference, advertising has never mattered less than in this campaign cycle. Jeb Bushs PAC spent $100 million and he went nowhere. People are tired of negative ads, viewing them as politics as usual. (Trump airs them as well, but doesnt spend much of his fortune doing so.)

Trumps critics believe that if there could just be more exposes, more digging, more focus on his past liberal views or current shifting of positions, his candidacy would collapse of its own weight.

But Trumps appeal is not tied to policy specifics. Its the image of strength he projects, the force of his personality and the notion that his business success shows he can shake up Washington.

Of course he benefits from enormous media attention, but look at how he does it. The three cable news networks carried his 45-minute presser, blowing off Hillarys speech, because it was anything but a canned political address. He took reporters questions, parried criticism of his companies, talked up his vodka and steaksit was a show. And yesterday he did a round of morning shows, taking still more questions and getting into a tiff with George Stephanopoulos over why the ABC anchor focused on the negative by bringing up late deciders who seemed to break against him.

Maybe there is some kryptonite that can weaken this guy. But as he runs roughshod over the Republican Party, no one has been able to find it.

Fifty-one-year-old William Hernandez of Big Bear was arrested on Monday on suspicion of rape and oral copulation. He remains jailed Wednesday in San Bernardino County. It's not clear if he's hired an attorney.

Police say Hernandez assaulted a woman for several hours last month at a motel in Rancho Cucamonga, and attacked two other women in Victorville.

Authorities say in all the cases, Hernandez allegedly identified himself as a police officer, threatened the victims with a gun and threatened to arrest them if they didn't stay in contact with him.

Authorities say they are concerned there may be other victims and are urging them to come forward.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,GOP senators caught in middle of 2016 chaos  and under pressure to take sides,['Chad Pergram'],"Lunch used to be a thing for lawmakers in Washington.

You could cab downtown to The Palm for a power lunch of steak au poivre and fried onions. Slide out the side door of the Dirksen Senate Office Building and across the parking lot to the legendary Monocle for braised lamb chops.

But sometimes, if youre a Republican senator, its simpler to just grab a bite with your GOP colleagues in the Mike Mansfield Room of the Capitol.

Yet even this is becoming a complicated media event thanks to the unpredictable presidential primary battle -- as reporters these days camp out in the Senate subway station, firing off a battery of questions to lunch-driven lawmakers about the apparent doom which supposedly looms for the Republican Party this year.

Donald Trump this. Ted Cruz that. Marco Rubio. Did someone say Kasich?

Major primaries in Ohio and Florida are on the horizon next week. The results could set the table for this campaign cycle. The House of Representatives isnt in session this week. So every reporter in Washington worth their byline made a beeline for the Capitol to query senators about the presidential race.

The hand-operated train which runs to the Russell Senate Office Building pulls in. Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and John McCain, R-Ariz., pile out. Reporters flock to McCain. Both are up for re-election this year. Burr, despite representing a swing state, somehow escapes the crew and hoofs it upstairs to the weekly GOP luncheon, practically incognito.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.  often a target for a press gaggle on intelligence and firearm issues  walks by with barely a notice.

Democrats arent important this week. Only Republicans.

This weeks reporter scrums in the Senate subway station were intense.

Some are starting to suggest that Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, may be the only person who can short-circuit Donald Trump en route to the Republican nomination. And yet not a single GOP senator has endorsed their colleague. That phenomenon is practically unheard of in American politics.

There was a rumor four senators were going to endorse Ted Cruz, said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. But that rumor was unfounded.

Four senators. Zero senators. It doesnt seem to matter much. Republican senators dont like Ted Cruz  even if some grudgingly concede he may be the only person capable of defeating Trump. And not everyone is sure Cruz is better than Trump.

Collins believes Cruz needs a Dale Carnegie course.

Im not sure Ted has developed relationships in the Senate, said Collins. Some of his rhetoric toward the Republican leader has not been conducive.

Last summer, Cruz raged on the floor about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., trade policy and an effort to renew the controversial Export-Import Bank.

I cannot believe that [McConnell] would tell a flat-out lie, steamed Cruz. We now know that when the majority leader looks us in the eyes and makes an explicit commitment that he is willing to say things that he knows are false.

Some Republicans  especially those in leadership or tenuous political positions  tried to take the high road with Cruz.

Teds a smart guy, said Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune, R-S.D. His tenure in the Senate has been him trying to be a disruptor.

And it was that disruption which seems to have turned off many of his Senate colleagues.

He was leading the government shutdown, said Collins. It was a disaster in every way.

Expectations were created that somehow we could win, echoed Thune of the shutdown.

Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., faced a competitive primary a few weeks ago. Republicans pumped significant monetary and human resources into the state at the end to close the deal for Shelby. Colleague Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., is the only senator to endorse Donald Trump. Shelby wasnt in much of a mood to talk shop Tuesday when a mob of reporters waited for him to disembark from the Senate trolley.

Im going to lunch right now, said Shelby brusquely brushing past the throng.

Things were almost as hectic on Wednesday as senators cruised past reporters from the subway station en route to a midday procedural vote. Only, there was no formal lunch planned this time. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., is also a vulnerable GOPer this cycle who hails from a swing state. But Johnson didnt feel accosted by reporters as he walked to one of the subways.

Im happy to answer questions, said Johnson. Or not answer, as the case may be.

He chuckled.

Would Trump or Cruz take a pragmatic approach to governing?

Im praying, replied Johnson.

Perhaps that means senators should say grace before lunch  regardless of where they decide to eat.

Here are the everyday items that scare these accident front-liners the most.

Trampolines

We see a lot of serious trampoline injuries...upper-body fractures, broken femurs, neck injuries. Thats why most ER doctors I work with wont buy trampolines for their kids. Theyre all trouble. Theres no good kind. Unfortunately parents get a false sense of reassurance; when theres a net around something, they think their kids will be safe. Dr. Ferdinando Mirarchi, medical director of the Department of Emergency Medicine at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center

Button batteries

Button batteries are increasingly common in car remotes and portable LED lights but they can be extremely dangerous to young kids. Toddlers like shiny objects and will ingest them. The danger is they can get stuck in the esophagus. When a coin gets stuck, it often passes on its own. But when a button battery gets stuck, the battery acid can eat through the wall of the esophagus, causing lifelong disability.Dr. David J. Mathison, pediatric emergency room physician and mid-Atlantic regional medical director, PM Pediatrics

Swimming pools

Unfortunately, every summer we see kidseven ones who can swimaccidentally fall into a pool and drown. For me, it is the fact that drowning occurs so fast, and often silently, that prevents me from ever wanting one at my house. All three of my children are swimmers, and we take them to pools, but I know that where I live I have left that risk behind.  Dr. Dara Kass, assistant professor in the Ronald O. Perelman Department of Emergency Medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center

Power washers and extension ladders

There are two items I dont keep around: power washers and extension ladders. We often treat people who have fallen off of high ladders, which results in serious and extensive injuries (head trauma, collapsed lungs). The surprising thing I wont own is a power washer. People end up with penetrating injuries or lacerations from their intense water stream.   Dr. Seth Podolsky, vice chair of Cleveland Clinic Emergency Medicine Institute

Ramen noodle soups

Ramen noodles, or similar soups in styrofoam containers, get extremely hot when microwaved. Its the most common cause of scald burns in toddlers and infants I see. Parents forget how hot these are when theyre on the counter, waiting to be pulled off by a handsy toddler.Dr. David J. Mathison.

Weve had more kids coming in with overdoses from hydrocodone and oxycodone pain drugs [found in Vicodin, Percocet, Oxycontin]. Just one extended-release pill can kill a child.Dr. Ferdinando Mirarchi.

High chairs that pull up to the table

I work at a pediatric and adult trauma center, but being a dad, most of my biggest issues are with child products. Over half of ER visits for children under 1 are due to falls. I wouldnt get a high chair that pulls up to the table, because Ive seen way too many kids use their feet to push against the table and tip their chair over backward.

U.S. President and CEO Michael Horn is leaving ""to pursue other opportunities effective immediately,"" the automaker said in a statement. He had been with the German auto maker for 25 years, assuming his most recent post in 2014.

Horn's sudden departure comes as the company continues to grapple with the fallout from its admission last year that nearly 600,000 cars were sold in the U.S. with software that regulators say was designed to cheat on required emissions tests.

The company potentially faces more than $20 billion in fines from state and federal regulators, as well as hundreds of class-action lawsuits filed on behalf of angry vehicle owners. The Justice Department is also conducting a criminal investigation.

It was Horn who was sent to apologize to consumers at a congressional hearing in October. But at the same time, he told lawmakers that top corporate officials had no knowledge of the cheating software installed in 11 million diesel cars worldwide.

""To my understanding this was not a corporate decision, this was something individuals did,"" Horn said, adding that he felt personally deceived.

A federal judge has given the company until March 24 to reach an agreement with the government on recalling the affected vehicles. U.S. District Court Judge Charles R. Breyer wants to know about available technical solutions to fix the cars and the status of negotiations on a potential settlement with affected owners.Volkswagen has not indicated whether it will be able to meet the deadline.

Volkswagen in September admitted to U.S. regulators that it had used illegal software installed in its so-called ""Clean Diesel"" engines. The cheating allowed cars to pass laboratory emissions tests while spewing levels of harmful nitrogen oxide at up to 40 times the level allowed when operating on real roads.

The company is negotiating with lawyers for the owners of the defective cars, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board. Both state and federal regulators will have to sign off on any planned recall.",[]

In an annual report to the Human Rights Council, Zeid Raad al-Hussein said a draft EU-Turkey agreement on handling the migration crisis announced this week raises serious concerns, including ""the potential for collective and arbitrary expulsions"" from the bloc. Zeid said he hadn't received full details of the draft, but urged the EU ""to adopt a much more rights-compliant and humane set of measures on migration at next week's summit.""

Zeid said he had concerns about the building of fences on European borders, the seizure of personal goods from migrants and refugees, and the arbitrary detention of people based on their nationalities.

""Today, in violation of the fundamental principles of solidarity, human dignity, and human rights, the race to repel these people is picking up momentum,"" he said.

The broad-ranging speech offered the High Commissioner for Human Rights a chance to chronicle an array of concerns, while acknowledging that the United Nations is not a sovereign body and cannot exercise criminal jurisdiction.

Zeid pointed to issues including some 300 reported police killings of African-Americans in the U.S. last year; ""signals"" that Russia wants to close the U.N. human rights office there; ongoing violence in Burundi, Syria, Libya, Yemen and South Sudan; and arrests of lawyers and activists in China. He expressed concerns about Turkey's recent actions against the media, including against the Zaman newspaper.

He said recent attacks against Israeli civilians were ""inexcusable"" but said the ""root causes of this violence also cannot be ignored""  the ""frustration and despair of Palestinians arises from the prolonged occupation"" as well as Israeli settlement expansion and settler violence in Palestinian areas and the blockade of Gaza.

Stephayne and Michael Potts spoke to the media for the first time since Artur Samarin was arrested, according to WPMT-TV. Samarin was known in Harrisburg as Asher Potts and was arrested on Feb. 23.

Stephayne Potts told reporters she called the FBI because she was worried that Samarin was going to hurt people at Harrisburg High School.

""He made comments about other shootings, and he told us that everyone would know his name. He said his name would be the biggest in the world,"" she said. ""He started talking about certain kids in school he wanted to hurt. He started talking about blowing he school up.""

Adam Klein, Samarins attorney, refuted the Potts comments. He said there was nothing to believe that Samarin had a violent past.

""Up until the time he was arrested, he was an upstanding student,"" Klein said. ""She is trying to paint herself as the victim. One would only need to look at her criminal history to see she is a con artist.""

The Potts said they met Samarin in 2012 while he was in Harrisburg with other Ukrainian students as part of an international work program, WPMT-TV reported. Stephanye Potts said she had talked to him inside the Townhouse Apartments complex in Harrisburg where she and her husband live and where Samarin was staying. Samarin told the couple he was getting beat up by fellow participants in the work program.

Stephayne Potts said she thought Samarin was 18 when she learned he was working at a Red Robin. But Samarin insisted that he was 14. In September of 2012, the Potts took in Samarin and he was enrolled in high school by October of that year. Stephayne Potts said she didnt need any documents to get him into Harrisburg High School.

She admitted that she knew Samarin was in the country illegally, but insisted she had intended to legalize his status when he turned 18.

""I still dont believe hes 23,"" she added. ""Someone will have to prove that to me. We watched him go from high pitched tones to the way he speaks now. His show size, clothing size, he got taller as well.""

Samarin was a member of the National Honor Society and the school's ROTC and Naval Sea Cadet programs. He was to graduate in June.

He was arrested in February and initially charged with theft, identity theft and records tampering. He is also facing a sexual assault charged over a relationship with a student.

The Potts have not been charged with any crimes.

Following Peyton Manning's retirement on Monday and Brock Osweiler's free-agent departure to the Houston Texans on Wednesday, Trevor Siemian is the last man standing behind center for the Denver Broncos.

For now.

There already have been reports that the Broncos will try to acquire Colin Kaepernick from the San Francisco 49ers, and there is growing speculation that Robert Griffin III also is on the team's radar following his release from the Washington Redskins.

With Brock Osweiler off to Houston, RGIII is on Broncos' list of replacement quarterbacks, per source. Could be visiting Denver.  Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 9, 2016

RG3 last appeared in a regular-season game during the 2014 season, when he played in nine games and started seven. This past season, he was firmly planted on the bench behind Kirk Cousins (and McCoy).

But it was just three seasons ago that Griffin electrified the NFL, being named the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year after throwing 20 touchdown passes with just five interceptions (and rushing for 815 yards and seven scores).

This is Housecall for Health.

Couch potatoes, rejoice! Extreme exercise may be toxic for your heart, according to a review of studies set to appear in the Canadian Journal of Cardiology.

Apparently pushing your body to the max day after day can stress your heart and raise your risk for a type of abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, or a-fib, which can ultimately lead to heart failure or a stroke.

But the researchers cautioned not exercising at all is far worse for your heart than overdoing it and as always that moderation is key.

Moderate-intensity exercise includes movement that raises your heartbeat such as casual sports, walking briskly, jogging, biking, or swimming.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that adults get at least 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week to help ward off unhealthy weight gain and heart disease.

The review analyzed 12 studies on a-fib and athletes and endurance runners.

In Tuesday's attack, the Palestinian assailant ran through the ancient port city of Jaffa with a knife, stabbing several people along his way, until he was shot by a police officer.

Israel's Justice Ministry said the routine check is conducted after every shooting incident by police.

It follows a video that emerged from the scene of the Jaffa stabbing, showing the attacker lying on the ground as an onlooker yells at the officer to shoot him ""in the head."" A sound that appears to be gunfire is heard. Other voices then tell the officer to stop, saying the attacker ""is lying down"" and ""don't shoot him again.""

The Palestinians accuse Israel of using excessive force in trying to subdue more than five months of near-daily Palestinian attacks. The bloodshed  mainly stabbings but also shootings and car-ramming attacks  has killed 28 Israelis and two Americans. During the same time, at least 179 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, a majority of which are said by Israel to have been attackers. The rest were killed in clashes with security forces.

The attack in Jaffa took place as Vice President Joe Biden, on a visit to Israel, was meeting former Israeli President Shimon Peres, at the nearby Peres Center for Peace. The American victim, Taylor Force, was a 28-year-old MBA student at Vanderbilt University and a West Point graduate who had served tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Biden criticized the Palestinians for failing to condemn the stabbing, after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' political party posted a statement online praising the stabber.

A statement from Abbas' office following his meeting with Biden on Wednesday night said Abbas offered his condolences for the American's death, but stressed that Israel has killed nearly 200 Palestinians during the current round of bloodshed.

In a press conference with the visiting Romanian president Thursday, Abbas did not directly mention the Jaffa attack but said he opposes ""violence, extremism and terrorism regardless of its source.""

Palestinians say the violence stems from frustration at nearly five decades of Israeli occupation. Israel says it is fueled by a campaign of Palestinian incitement compounded on social media sites that glorify and encourage attacks.

Continue Reading Below

OPEC officials including Nigeria's oil minister have said a meeting would take place in Moscow on that date, potentially as the next step in widening an agreement to freeze output at January levels struck by OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Qatar plus non-member Russia last month.

But the biggest roadblock to a wider deal, OPEC delegates say, is Iran. Tehran feels it should be exempt from the agreement as it wants to recover market share it lost under Western sanctions. Kuwait said on Tuesday it will commit to the deal - if all major producers including Iran do so.

""They are not agreeing on the meeting. Why would the ministers meet again now? Iran says they will not do anything,"" said an OPEC source from a major producer. ""Only if Iran agrees, things will change.""

The pact on freezing output has helped support oil prices, which started a slide in mid-2014 due to oversupply. Brent crude was trading above $40 a barrel on Thursday, up 50 percent from a 12-year low of $27.10 reached in January.

Some delegates are wary that if many oil producers met too soon before getting the nod from everyone, prices could weaken again if the talks ended in disarray.

Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

""Our view is not to go there with the possibility of no agreement so as not to affect prices negatively,"" said another source from a major OPEC member, referring to the proposed March 20 meeting.

OPEC's Gulf members favor meeting in the first half of April, in Doha or another Gulf city, a Gulf delegate said last week.

Another OPEC delegate was more pessimistic, saying he expected no major progress until OPEC's next scheduled meeting in June.

IRAN COMPROMISE?

Tehran has rejected freezing its output at January levels, put by OPEC secondary sources at 2.93 million barrels per day (bpd), and wants to return to much higher pre-sanctions production.

""Tehran wanted a freeze ... for them to be based on 4 million barrels per day, their pre-sanctions production figure,"" said one source familiar with the discussions. A source familiar with Iranian thinking agreed.

The issue is set to be discussed this month when Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak meets Iranian counterpart Bijan Zanganeh.

Some OPEC sources hinted that there could be a workable agreement on the table to get Tehran on board.

""If they are willing to find a solution, they should offer a fair deal to Iran,"" one said.

There are precedents for OPEC members to be exempt from agreements on output restraint. Iraq, for example, was not included for many years due to sanctions and war. (Reporting by Rania El Gamal and Alex Lawler; Editing by Dale Hudson)",[]

The minute-and-a-half ad features a boy coming out to his father by writing, I like boys on a McCafe coffee cup and sliding it across the table.

The father initially seems upset, and walks away. But he quickly returns with his own coffee cup and writes, I accept that you like boys. Music swells and the son cries tears of joy. The spot closes with the tag, ""Let there be more warmth in conversations.""

On YouTube the ad has over 6,900 likes and has been viewed 1.6 million times. According to the Shanghaiist, the spot has received mostly positive feedback from local viewers.

But the Alliance of Taiwan Religious Groups for the Protection of Family is condemning the ad, saying it promotes homosexual behavior.

""Because McDonalds is frequented by many children, it is especially important to oppose the promotion of same-sex behavior,"" Chang Shou-yi of the Alliance of Taiwan Religious Groups for the Protection of Family, told Taiwanese media. Chang accused McDonald's of ""openly promoting gay issues"" and mis-educating children on sexual behavior.

The group is calling for a nationwide boycott of the restaurant.

When the spot debuted on March 6, Brenda Kou, who heads McDonalds marketing department in Taiwan, told Apple Daily that the brands intent was to show the spirit of open dialogue between family members. She also said that McDonalds wanted to express that different voices can be accepted in society.

Same-sex marriage is not legally recognized in Taiwan, although seven cities currently accept household registrations of same-sex couples.

Two intoxicated women started playing the music and when fellow passengers started to complain, the women started to play the music louder, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Paul Berry, a Spirit Airlines spokesman, told the LA Times when the women were told to turn the music down, they defiantly asked what are you going to do?

When the drunken women held the boom box in the air, a second group of passengers approached them and started the melee, Berry said.

LAX police were notified of the situation and officers met the crew as soon as the plane landed. Officer Rob Pedregon told the Los Angeles Times the women who were in a so-called mutual combat situation were taken off the plan.

FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller told the newspaper federal authorities were called in to investigate the brawl and that no one was charged in the incident.

Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders staked their ground Wednesday night in Florida -- both vowing not to deport children and illegal immigrants with a clean criminal record.

Their comments set up a showdown with Republican candidates Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who have both vowed to clamp down on illegal immigrants in the country -- including, at least in Trump's case, -- mass deportations, including children.

Clinton and Sanders squared off in their eighth debate Wednesday night held at Miami Dade College in Florida. The Univision/CNN debate is the final one scheduled this month between the candidates in the running for the 2016 Democratic nomination.

Both Clinton and Sanders have vowed to push for immigration reform if elected president.

The essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families, Sanders said.

Clinton says she will extend President Obamas executive orders shielding some illegal immigrants from deportation.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Can cousin of marijuana plant ease NFL's concussion problem?,[],"Former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon calls himself ""old school,"" including his use of marijuana both during and after his career.

Yet McMahon's stab at self-medicating could be ahead of its time. Researchers at Johns Hopkins plan to test whether a compound found in hemp  and its notorious cousin, cannabis  proves as effective in treating brain injuries as testimonials claim.

Some former players believe cannabidiol, or CBD, could help millions who suffer brain injuries each year, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative disease caused by repeated concussions and found in many former NFL players whose brains have been autopsied.

""I don't think any of us regret what we did,"" said Jake Plummer, who played 10 seasons before retiring in 2007. ""But there's no question it comes at a real cost.""

Along with a handful of other retired players, Plummer felt strongly enough about the benefits of using CBD to appear in a public-service campaign titled ""When the Bright Lights Fade."" It was sponsored by Realm of Caring, a nonprofit research organization and CW Botanicals, a dietary supplements company specializing in hemp products. It was released Wednesday as part of National Brain Injury Awareness month with the goal of raising $100,000 to begin the Johns Hopkins study.

""I've had friends, guys I played alongside, whose mood changed from night to day. I know others who've replaced hellacious amounts of painkillers with CBD ... and I hope this gets even more guys involved,"" Plummer said. ""The bigger the number, the better chance we have to get in front of (NFL commissioner) Roger Goodell and say, 'You need to fund this.' Not just for football players, but for the millions of others it could help.""

Because of a lack of research and varying federal and state regulations, the science and the law on CBD are far from settled. Major medical organizations have not supported marijuana to treat concussions, but many also say what the U.S. government patent on cannabinoids, including CBD, states: They act as ""neuroprotectants"" and have shown to be effective at limiting damage in cases of stroke or trauma and to treat degenerative diseases.

Versions of the CBD compound are available in some stores and online in creams, pills and oils. Some claim to be rich in CBD, with little or no THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), the psychoactive agent that produces a ""high."" At least one manufacturer says its CBD product won't trip a positive NFL drug test. According to the Food and Drug Administration, none are approved for the ""diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of any disease.""

But in the last three years, encouraged by a CNN documentary on medical marijuana, thousands of parents whose children's diagnoses range from autism to epilepsy mounted a Facebook campaign to sing its praises. They were soon joined by adults suffering from cancer or Parkinson's disease. Many reported better pain management, impactful mood changes and significant decreases in seizures. Some families even relocated to Colorado to use CBD legally.

""Imagine if we'd suddenly found a plant extract in the Amazon that was as effective as CBD seems to be ... and it was non-psychoactive, non-addictive and non-toxic, and had none of the stigma attached to it that marijuana does. We'd be all over it,"" said Joel Stanley, co-founder of CW Botanicals and the eldest of six brothers working in the family's medical marijuana business in Colorado. ""We think we already have it.""

They began growing medical marijuana in 2009 and soon after produced a strain they called ""Hippie's Disappointment,"" because it was high in CBD but low in THC. There was no market for it until 2012, when Page Figli, whose 5-year-old daughter Charlotte suffered from intractable epilepsy, came searching for CBD-rich oil. Soon after using it, according to her parents. Charlotte's seizures dropped from hundreds per day to almost none. The Stanleys, who said their waiting list for treatment once numbered 12,000 families, renamed the strain Charlotte's Web.

""I can't think of a better, safer thing to look at helping players dealing with a range of injuries and pain,"" Stanley said. ""They're already pumping dangerous pills into these guys like it's candy.""

McMahon, 56, has been diagnosed with early onset dementia and struggles with many of the attendant symptoms: depression, memory loss, vision and speech impairment and severe headaches. He says medical marijuana  he still prefers a high THC strain  helped him kick a 100-Percocet-a-month habit to cope with the lingering pain in his shoulders, neck and arms after a 15-year NFL career.

At a ""Cannabis and Athletics"" panel late last month, McMahon said he smoked marijuana with his Super Bowl-winning teammates often enough that coach Mike Ditka referred to the group as ""You pot smokers.""

""We'd say, 'It's better than being drunk out here,"" McMahon told the Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram. ""We're still functioning.'""

Though there are no reliable surveys, many NFL players have estimated half the players or more used marijuana, including many more interested in pain management than the buzz.

""Safety is not just while you're playing, it's what happens after you walk away from the game, too,"" said Baltimore Ravens tackle Eugene Monroe, one of the few active players taking part in the fundraising effort.

Monroe does not use CBD. He got interested in the research after seeing the CNN documentary and befriending a doctor whose autistic child had frequent seizures. Conversations with fellow players have heightened that interest.

""I saw where commissioner Goodell said the NFL would consider it, if the science is there to back it up,"" Monroe said. ""Well, here's their chance to get involved. Let's take a look at whether and how this can benefit our players. We're talking about funding medical research, not about smoking pot.""",[]

Trudeau, who has captured Americans' attention in a way not seen since his father's time, was to meet with President Barack Obama on Thursday and enjoy the honor of a state dinner, the first for a Canadian since 1997.

Accompanying the 44-year-old son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau on the trip to Washington was his wife, Sophie Gregoire.

""He's going to make a real splash,"" Canadian Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a phone interview.

Freeland, a former U.S.-based news executive, said Canada is ""a little bit like the girl next door, absolutely essential, a bedrock relationship, but easy to not focus on because there are so many more troubling and more exotic distractions."" But Freeland said Canada needs ""Americans to take the relationship seriously,"" and Trudeau helps put Canada on the radar.

Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, with more than $2 billion worth of goods and services crossing the border every day. About 75 percent of Canada's exports go to the U.S.

Besides trade, the two leaders were expected to seek common ground on environment protection. Before their meeting, the U.S. and Canada said in a statement that they will work to put in place an international agreement in Paris on curbing global warming. They committed to reducing methane emissions by 40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels over the coming decade.

Methane is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted in the U.S. from human activities and is much more efficient at trapping radiation than carbon dioxide.

Trudeau's father swept into power in 1968 and, with a short interruption, served until 1984. He was often compared to President John F. Kennedy and remains one of the few Canadian politicians known in America.

Tall and fit, Justin Trudeau channels the charisma of his father. He aims to restore his father's legacy as leader of the Liberal Party, which was under siege during 10 years of Conservative rule under Stephen Harper, Trudeau's predecessor.

Harper's relations with Obama were strained over various issues, notably the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, which the Obama administration rejected last year. The American ambassador to Canada, Bruce Heyman, could not get a meeting with Harper or his Cabinet ministers for months.

But Trudeau's election in October ushered in a new era for Canada's politics that Trudeau, Heyman and others hope will help strengthen relations with the U.S.

""President Obama has only had nine state dinners, so he only has one or two a year. The fact that Canada is his 10th state dinner is a strong demonstration of the U.S.-Canada relationship and the importance to the president,"" Heyman said in an interview. ""These are two leaders who have very similar goals and philosophies.""",[]

Not only does he have time to spend on any number of philanthropic endeavors, he's also not shy about engaging in a Reddit AMA every now and again.

That said, Gates on Tuesday afternoon returned to Reddit for the fourth time where he answered questions on a whole host of topics, including the FBI's ongoing legal battle with Apple, how he used to skip class while he was a student at Harvard, and much more.

DON'T MISS: Ex-boyfriend brilliantly trolls woman who won't return iPhone he gave her as a gift

With respect to the mobile encryption issue that Apple and the FBI are currently embroiled in, Gates took a middle of the road approach when asked for his take on the issue.

""I think there needs to be a discussion about when the government should be able to gather information,"" Gates answered. ""What if we had never had wiretapping? Also the government needs to talk openly about safeguards. Right now a lot of people don't think the government has the right checks to make sure information is only used in criminal situations. So this case will be viewed as the start of a discussion. I think very few people take the extreme view that the government should be blind to financial and communication data but very few people think giving the government carte blanche without safeguards makes sense. A lot of countries like the UK and France are also going through this debate. For tech companies there needs to be some consistency including how governments work with each other. The sooner we modernize the laws the better.""

When asked what he would do if he found himself in Apple's position, Gates answered: ""Maybe they could propose an overall plan for striking the balance between government being able to know things in some cases and having safeguards to make sure those powers are confined to appropriate cases. There is no avoiding this debate and they could contribute to how the balance should be struck.""

Of course, the entirety of the AMA wasn't exclusively devoted to serious topics. For instance, when asked what his fondest memory from Harvard was, Gates recalled a rather amusing story.

I decided that I would be different and never attend any class I was signed up for but always attend a class I wasn't signed up for. This worked out in a funny way when the final exam for a Combinatorics class (which I signed up for) was given at the same table as my Brain studies class (which I attended and did not sign up for). My friends from Brain studies thought it was very strange that I sat on the wrong side of the table and took the Combinatorics exam even when I was the most vocal student in the Brain class.

When asked how he was able to make this work, given that he was taking an exam for a class he never attended, Gates added:

I studied super hard during reading period and almost always got A's. The big exception was organic chemistry where the promised video tapes of the lectures sometimes had no sound or no video -- that spooked me and I ended up getting a C+ in the course!

Oh that Gates, always tough to keep tabs on that guy. And truth be told, a C+ in organic chemistry without attending any classes is impressive in its own right.

When asked for his thoughts on what the next biggest advancement in technology will be over the next two decades, Gates said that robots with vision ""and manipulation as good as humans"" will be something that will achieved within a 10-year window. Gates further added that ""medical advances will also be amazing and unbelievable.""

As for what type of technological advancements scare Gates, the Microsoft founder said that biological tools would certainly pose a threat should they wind up in the wrong hands.

Some other notable tidbits from the AMA include:

Gates believes Pirates of Silicon Valley "" was a reasonable recapitulation of the early days of the PC industry.""

was a reasonable recapitulation of the early days of the PC industry."" Gates always uses the latest version of Windows, hardly a shocker.

Programming was the most useful thing Gates ever learned. ""I was obsessed with programming from age 14 to 19 and that is a good time to keep trying to improve.""

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Tampon tax: Does being female in the US carry unfair costs?,[],"Margo Seibert and Natalie Brasington don't think women should have to pay a ""period tax,"" and like a growing number of other women, they are publicly questioning whether being female in the U.S. carries unfair costs.

The pair are among five New York City women who filed a lawsuit last week arguing that it was unconstitutional for the state to levy sales tax on tampons and sanitary napkins while offering medical product exemptions to many other items used by both genders, like lip balm, foot powder and dandruff shampoo.

The case, they say, is about more than the few cents in tax levied on each pack.

Sick of the social taboo, and frustrated by a lack of access for some to a staple, these women and others are talking very publicly about menstruation and gaining political traction that would have been impossible a generation ago.

A national push to abolish sales tax on tampons is gathering steam, led by social media campaigns like #periodswithoutshame. At least seven states are now considering legislation. Illinois lawmakers were holding a hearing on the latest proposal Wednesday. Connecticut legislators discussed the issue Monday.

Cosmopolitan magazine launched an online petition, and even President Barack Obama has questioned why the items are taxed.

""I tend to talk about my period quite a bit, to anyone who will listen,"" said Seibert, a 31-year-old actress and founder of an online campaign that promotes a ""shame-free"" period.

Brasington, a 31-year-old photographer, said the tax affects women disproportionately and is a genuine burden for poorer women.

""Being a woman is so expensive,"" she said.

Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, a vice president at the NYU School of Law's Brennan Center for Justice, said she began writing articles and op-eds on ""menstrual equity"" when she discovered food pantries were desperate for sanitary napkins and tampons because poor women can't afford them.

The tax campaign reflects a broader debate over ""gender pricing,"" or charging women and men different rates for similar products and services, from haircuts to razors to T-shirts.

New York City's consumer protection agency studied the cost of 800 common household items last year and found that products marketed to women cost, on average, 7 percent more than similar products for men.

""Women's outcry over this issue isn't just about the tax on tampons. It's a reflection of the routine unfairness that seeps into our everyday lives,"" said Sonia Ossorio, president of the National Organization for Women in New York. ""At the end of the day, the tampon tax movement is one small way to challenge the broader sexism that still persists. Because that's the real taboo here.""

While women's advocates have long lamented that many women's products cost more, their providers say there can be legitimate reasons  a more decorative product or more complicated haircut, for instance. And some have noted that women sometimes pay less: for life and auto insurance, for example.

Nationwide, 40 states tax feminine hygiene products, deeming them non-necessities or even ""luxury items,"" while making exceptions for products as similar as adult incontinence pads.

Currently, five U.S. states exempt tampons and other feminine hygiene products from their sales tax, which varies around the country from about 2.9 percent to as high as 7.5 percent. Another five states have no sales tax.

New York taxes tampons and sanitary napkins as tools ""to control a normal bodily function and to maintain personal cleanliness.""

The 4 percent state sales tax on the products costs New York women millions of dollars a year; estimates range from about $7 million to twice that, a minute fraction of the state's $142 billion budget.

Advocates say the cost, however small it may seem, is burdensome for poor women, who also can't purchase the products with food stamps.

""Having one's period is not a luxury,"" state Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal, a Democrat who has proposed abolishing the tax. ""Because of our biology, we bear this extra cost, and the state should not compound it.""

The state Department of Taxation and Finance declined to comment, citing the lawsuit. Two major manufacturers of feminine hygiene products, P&G, the maker of the Tampax brand, and Edgewell Personal Care Co., the maker of the Playtex brand, didn't respond to inquiries this week about the tax issue.

Zoe Salzman, the attorney on the New York case, said they'd push to get a judge to rule the tax unlawful.

""If men had to use these products every month, they would already be tax-exempt,"" she said.

Meanwhile, the legislative proposal has yet to get a hearing, though supporters are hopeful about its prospects, especially since Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo recently said the tax should be abolished.

That wasn't the sense in Utah, where a legislative committee last month nixed a proposal to tax-exempt the items. While some members of the all-male committee supported the idea, others questioned where the state would draw the line on what to tax in the future.

The Los Angeles Times, in an editorial last week, expressed similar concerns in opposing a tax exemption that California lawmakers are considering.

Overseas, Canada removed taxes on the items last year, and British leaders, who have set the tax at the lowest possible level, have considered doing away with it altogether.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,More Republicans coming to grips with fact that Cruz may be the one to stop Trump,[],"Sen. Ted Cruz during a campaign event on Tuesday, Feb. 2, 2016, in Greenville, S.C.ap

Earlier in the presidential campaign season, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz was possibly the least likely candidate to get the backing of the so-called Republican establishment.

But after the meteoritic rise of billionaire businessman Donald Trump and the stumbles of favorites like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and, more recently, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, more and more Republican officials are coming to terms with the fact that their second least favorite candidate may be their best shot at defeating Trump.

Possible Cruz supporters include reluctant Senate colleagues and former presidential rivals with strong ties to major donors, who have long feared Cruz's purist ideology but dread the prospect of a Trump nomination even more. The first-term Texas senator on Wednesday announced the backing of one former primary opponent, Carly Fiorina, and is seeking the backing of another, Jeb Bush, on Thursday.

""It's an outsider year, and the most logical person to take on Trump based on past performance is Ted Cruz,"" said another former presidential opponent, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham. Earlier in the year, Graham likened the choice between Cruz and Trump to ""being shot or poisoned.""

""He's not my preference,"" Graham said of Cruz. ""But we are where we are. And if Trump wins Florida and Ohio, I don't know if we can stop him.""

Indeed, next Tuesday's winner-take-all contests in Florida and Ohio have injected a sense of urgency into the GOP's anti-Trump movement.

The billionaire businessman is calling on mainstream Republicans to unify behind his candidacy ahead of next week's primaries, which could give him an insurmountable delegate lead.

""If I win those two, I think it's over,"" Trump told CNN's ""Anderson Cooper's 360.""

""Instead of fighting it, they should embrace it,"" he added on Fox News Channel.

Bush planned to confer with all the candidates  save Trump  ahead of Thursday's GOP debate. He met privately with Rubio on Wednesday, and planned to meet with Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Thursday.

Bush and Trump engaged in heated confrontations throughout Bush's campaign, repeatedly referring to each other as ""loser.""

The GOP establishment's overwhelming favorite, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, picked up where Bush left off, but struggled badly in Tuesday's round of primary contests, failing to pick up a single delegate. Trump won three of the contests and Cruz won one.

Now, in the midst of a weeklong march through Florida to save his candidacy, Rubio concedes that he went too far in insulting Trump.

""My kids were embarrassed by it and if I had it to do over again I wouldn't,"" Rubio said on MSNBC Wednesday night.

Rubio's weak standing has forced some of his supporters to consider Cruz.

""I could see myself as a Cruz supporter,"" Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, a Rubio supporter, said Wednesday. ""I agree with Cruz 80 percent of the time. There are things I don't agree with him on, but if we are agreeing 80 percent of the time and he's a conservative, we are going to get along just fine.""

Still, no Republican senator has endorsed Cruz, who called Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a liar and helped engineer the 16-day partial government shutdown in 2013. Half a dozen Senate Republicans said Wednesday that they hadn't heard from either Trump or Cruz.

Trump has one Senate endorsement, from Alabama's Jeff Sessions, while Rubio has endorsements from 14 senators.

Fiorina, though, offered Cruz an immediate dose of credibility with his party's skeptical donor class. She told a Miami crowd on Wednesday that she's ""horrified"" by Trump.

""The truth is that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are two sides of the same coin,"" she charged, standing alongside Cruz. ""It is time now to unite behind the one man who can beat Donald Trump, who can beat Hillary Clinton.""

In the latest Democratic debate, Clinton and Bernie Sanders tangled Wednesday night over who's a true advocate for Latinos.

Facing off just six days before Florida's primary, Clinton faulted Sanders for repeatedly voting against a 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill; he faulted her for opposing a 2007 effort to allow people who were in the country illegally to obtain driver's licenses.

Sanders surprised Clinton with a win Tuesday night in Michigan, a victory that breathed new life into his White House bid. But Clinton, who won Mississippi, padded her delegate lead and is now halfway to the number needed to clinch the nomination.

On the Republican side, things are far more chaotic.

""The Republican establishment is in its death throes,"" said longtime tea party leader Mark Meckler. ""The only remaining candidates are 100 percent anti-establishment.""

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Many hormone doctors feel uncomfortable with transgender patients,[],"People who are transgender may have difficulty finding endocrinologists who feel comfortable and competent in providing needed care, according to a new survey of physicians.

Endocrinologists are often key healthcare providers for people who are transgender. They specialize in the endocrine system, which regulates the body's hormones, and they may prescribe sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen to help transgender patients develop the physical characteristics tied to their gender identity.

But about a third of endocrinologists are unwilling to care for patients who are transgender, and less than half say they feel at least somewhat competent in providing that care, said Dr. Michael Irwig, who surveyed the doctors at an endocrinology meeting last year.

""There is still a big access problem,"" said Irwig, associate professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C. ""The fact that 30 percent won't see transgender patients wouldn't happen with any other diagnosis.""

""Basically, nobody had really done a similar survey before,"" said Irwig, who is also director of the Andrology Center at GW Medical Faculty Associates.

He asked 80 endocrinology providers from Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington, D.C. to answer a 19-item survey. About 80 percent answered the survey.

Overall, 15 percent said they were not at all comfortable discussing gender identity, and another 34 percent said they were only slightly comfortable discussing the subject.

Fifty-eight percent reported being less comfortable with transgender patients than with non-transgender patients.

Fellowship training on transgender care was uncommon, reported by less than one-third of the doctors overall and by 58 percent of those ages 25 to 39.

Only 41 percent of participants felt at least somewhat competent in providing care to transgender people.

And only 63 percent said transgender patients could be seen at their practice. Irwig said he asked participants to explain why such patients couldn't be seen, ""but a lot of them didn't fill in that open-ended question.""

He told Reuters Health there could be a number of reasons for doctors refusing to see transgender patients, including prejudice, lack of understanding and not feeling competent in providing the needed care.

More training and experience may help improve healthcare access, said Irwig.

The Endocrine Society is updating its 2009 guidelines for caring for people who are transgender. The guidelines provide guidance and legitimacy, said Dr. Josh Safer, who is working on the update.

""The guidelines are an evidence-based, thoughtful approach from the ultimate mainstream endocrinology professional society and that is very strong for those needing reliable sources,"" said Safer, of the Boston University School of Medicine, in an email to Reuters Health.

The updated guidelines include changes to terminology, new practices on how to care for transgender adolescents and how transgender care fits within the larger medical community, he added in a phone interview.

Irwig said transgender people likely know healthcare access is an issue. To find endocrinologists who can provide culturally competent care, he suggests that patients calling doctors' offices ""ask their staff how many transgender patients are seen in the practice, because that will give them a good idea.""

Safer said he considers it a priority to train endocrinologists in transgender medical care. He is educating his own trainees on the subject.

""However, this is a long process,"" he said.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,How to answer your body's food cravings,[],"Food cravings arent just a silly thing pregnant women deal with for 40 weeks, we all feel the urge to eat foods that may not serve our health and weight goals.

While some cravings are the results of gut bacterial overgrowth, many are really an SOS message of malnutrition from your body.

Most of our food is grown in depleted, over-farmed soil, which lacks the minerals and nutrients it once contained before large scale agriculture. In a 2013 update of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2010), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that our average intake of important nutrients like potassium, calcium, and magnesium is so low, that it declared the issue a widespread public health issue.

Yet, we eat more food and calories than ever before, and also have an obesity epidemic that grows steadily each year. What gives?

Most of our calories come from refined carbohydrates in the form of sweetened processed foods, which are mostly devoid of essential minerals and nutrients. So we end up craving the vitamins and minerals that our body is lacking. Your body may be craving exactly what it needs.

Magnesium is needed for blood glucose control, muscle and nerve function, and blood pressure regulation. Chromium is necessary for controlling blood sugar, and turning food into energy. Calcium is needed to keep our blood acidity in check, as well as keeping bones and teeth strong.

The chocolate that your conscious mind craves is really a brilliant answer to the magnesium you didnt know you were lacking. And your body and brain know that to quench the nutritional based craving for the important mineral it needs is most easily, happily, and deliciously met by chocolate. (Of course, it also gets a nice hit of caffeine-like theobromine, sugar and fat, which it also likes very much, but probably doesnt need.)

So your body may be craving foods that get you a quick fix of these minerals. It likes to ask for the easiest foods that also give a hit of energy and sugar, too, so sometimes your cravings for magnesium are interpreted as chocolate...like, NOW.""

When my clients begin to see their nutritional cravings for what they are -- messages from the body to boost their micronutrient intake -- they feel the pressure and shame around their cravings totally relax, and begin to feel more in tune with -- and trusting of -- their amazing bodies.

Here are three of the top nutritional cravings you may experience, with easy options of healthy foods to answer your bodys real needs:

Chocolate = magnesium = hemp seeds, chia seeds, kelp

Oily Fatty Snacks = calcium = mustard greens, broccoli, sesame

Coffee = sulfur = egg yolks, garlic, onion





In my book, Women, Food & Desire, I go more in-depth into the nutritional, emotional, physical, and bacterial roots of our cravings.

As for our bacterial roots, put simply we are as bacterial as we are human. We couldnt live without them, as these tiny organisms help us digest and absorb nutrients from our food, help create vitamins and hormones, and keep our skin healthy. We dont even know the extent of their impact on our health yet, but one thing is for sure: they need to eat, too.

Some of these bacteria can get a little out of hand, like a bunch of frat boys who move into an apartment and wreck the place when they invite over dozens of their friends to feast on pizza and beer. Those bad guys, including the candida yeasts which result in vaginal yeast infections, have one favorite food that keeps them growing and multiplying: sugar.

Normally those little beasties are kept in check from overgrowing by the other good bacteria. But our modern lives are like a carpet bomb on the inner microbiomes healthy, balanced ecology. Everything from highly refined and sugary diets, constant stress, antibiotic overuse, and hormonal imbalance caused by toxins in our food and even overuse of birth control pills can kill off the good guys, leaving room for the bad guys to take over.

And its the puppet master that pulled your strings straight to the freezer for a dish of ice cream. Those bacteria live mostly in our digestive system, and communicate with our entire body through the nervous system, demanding to be fed, pulling us to crave sugary and starchy foods, as well as dairy with its milk sugar lactose.

Their sugar cravings are often your sugar cravings. Now, not all sugar cravings are caused by bacterial overgrowth, or dysbiosis, and weve all felt the emotionally calming call of a cupcake after a rough day or breakup.

But the dangers of these bacterial imbalances are real. Digestive distress from bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation, and leaky gut are all warning signs of bacterial disharmony. If these symptoms continue and grow, the puppet master will cause you to eat your way into weight loss resistance, hormonal and thyroid conditions, blood sugar imbalances, skin problems, and mood swings.

And your gut needs to be strong, healthy, and balanced in order for you to be strong and healthy. To heal your gut and support your digestion you need to keep the good bacteria constantly flowing in, with the right foods and supplements, and avoid the foods and stressors that keep the bad bacteria from moving back into town.

Foods that balance gut bacteria:

Naturally fermented foods like raw sauerkraut, kimchee, unpasteurized miso paste, and unpasteurized apple cider vinegar bring a wide variety of natural probiotics (the good bacteria) into your digestive system, many of which may not be found in man-made probiotic supplements.

Bernie Sanders staked their ground Wednesday night in Florida as both vowing not to deport children and illegal immigrants with a clean criminal record.

Their comments set up a showdown with Republican candidates Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who both have vowed to clamp down on illegal immigrants in the country.

Trump and Cruz, along with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich will get their opportunity to address the thorny topic Thursday when they debate in the Sunshine State.

Clinton and Sanders squared off in their eighth debate Wednesday night held at Miami Dade College in Florida. The Univision/CNN debate is the final one scheduled this month between the candidates in the running for the 2016 Democratic nomination.

During the debate, both Clinton and Sanders vowed to push for immigration reform if elected president.

The essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families, Sanders said.

Clinton says she will extend President Obamas executive orders shielding some illegal immigrants from deportation.

Clinton called the New York businessman un-American and said he traffics in prejudice and paranoia.

You dont make America great again by getting rid of everything that made America great, Clinton said, referencing Trumps campaign slogan.

Sanders said voters would never elect a candidate like Trump.

Clinton also slammed Trumps plan to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.

As I understand, hes talking about a tall wall. A beautiful, tall wall, Clinton said, adding that Trumps plan to keep out immigrants and his claim hell get Mexico to pay for it is a fantasy.

Clinton then turned her sights on Sanders, accusing him of supporting legislation that would have led to indefinite detention of people facing deportation, and for standing with Minutemen vigilantes.

Sanders refuted the notion, which he called ""ridiculous"" and ""absurd,"" and accused Clinton of picking small pieces out of big legislative packages to distort his voting record.

""No, I do not support vigilantes and that is a horrific statement and an unfair statement to make,"" he said, adding: ""I will match my record against yours any day of the week.""

Clinton also dodged early debate questions about ongoing investigations into her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. When debate moderator Jorge Ramos of Univision asked her if she would drop out of the race if indicted over the handling of her email while secretary of state she replied,""Oh for goodness sake, that is not going to happen. I'm not even answering that question.""

The FBI is investigation the possibility of mishandling of sensitive information that passed through Clinton's private email server.

Sanders, as he has in the past, declined to bite on the issue, saying, ""The process will take its course."" He said he'd rather talk about the issues of wealth and income inequality.

Clinton also defended her role in the deadly 2012 attack on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya.

She said Wednesday that her shifting explanations for the crisis in the early hours were because of changing dynamics and new information.

Clinton also said the investigation has been politicized by Republicans seeking to score points against her campaign.

""This was fog of war,"" she said, saying that she regrets the lives lost in the crisis.

She added: ""I wish there could be an easy answer at the time but we learned a lot.""

Sanders came into Wednesday nights debate after a surprise primary win in Michigan Tuesday, where he had been trailing by more than 20 points in the polls.

Clinton vowed to keep fighting Wednesday, saying, It was a very close race. Ive won some and Ive lost some.

Sanders campaign officials made the case Tuesday night that the Vermont senators attacks on Clintons support for free trade deals had an impact in the Michigan race, and likely will be effective in upcoming contests in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri.

The Sanders camp maintains Clintons advantage in the South will go away after next Tuesday, as rural voters in other states take a closer look at their candidate.

Clinton, though she maintains a healthy lead overall, needs Floridas 99 delegates up for grabs March 15 to help clinch the nomination.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"NASCAR's boss decision to back Trump threatens diversity efforts, sponsorships",[],"When Brian France endorsed Donald Trump for president, the chairman and chief executive of NASCAR thought of it as nothing more than a ""routine endorsement.""

He's been dealing with the fallout ever since.

France's decision to personally back the front-runner for the Republican nomination has roiled a sport his family built from the ground up. It's threatened a decade of work to broaden NASCAR's appeal among minorities, upset one of the most powerful teams in the sport and risked a break with the corporate sponsors that are its financial lifeblood.

""I was frankly, very surprised, that my diversity efforts for my whole career would have been called into question, over this, in my view, a routine endorsement,"" France said Wednesday in an interview with The Associated Press.

France acknowledged he's had to have conversations with sponsors since making the endorsement, which came as NASCAR is seeking a new main sponsor for its top series.

""I made a few phone calls and clarified some things,"" he said. ""That kind of goes with the territory.""

France's appearance at a Trump rally the day before last week's Super Tuesday elections fits with the sport's history of occasionally blending politics with the action at the track. France's grandfather, NASCAR founder Bill France Sr., endorsed George Wallace for president. Its all-time winningest driver, Richard Petty, celebrated his 200th victory with President Ronald Reagan and ran for statewide office in North Carolina in the 1990s.

France told the AP on Wednesday he backed Barack Obama in 2008 and actively participated in the campaign, shifting his support to Mitt Romney four years later.

""I supported Obama. I went to his rallies. I parted with my hard-earned money. There was a movement going on, and I was really thrilled with the idea of the first African-American president,"" he said. ""I did the same for Mitt Romney. In both of those cases, I have never agreed with all of their policies.""

But Trump is a candidate unlike any other in recent memory, drawing intense criticism for the racial undertones of his rhetoric and policies. The billionaire has called immigrants from Mexico rapists and drug dealers, has vowed to forcibly deport the 11 million people living in the country illegally and seeks to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the U.S.

Trump has also earned the explicit or implicit backing of a slew of white nationalist leaders, including former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has compared his language to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.

It's into that cauldron that France inserted himself and his sport  admittedly without knowing all of what Trump has proposed. ""I don't even know all their policies, truthfully,"" France said. He said he likes Trump's ""business approach"" and his status as a Washington outsider. He also cited the electricity around the Trump campaign and a friendship with one of Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr., that dates back nearly two decades.

""I'm not supporting him for all of his views, or his immigration views,"" France said. ""I happen to be very enamored by the excitement he's brought and the voter turnout that it is creating.""

France also is trying to protect his record on diversity. He said NASCAR has spent ""tens of millions of dollars"" on a program aimed at boosting the participation of minorities in the sport. That program includes Japanese-American driver Kyle Larson, who competes in the top-level Sprint Cup, and Darrell Wallace Jr., a driver in the second-tier Xfinity Series who is black and who came up through NASCAR's diversity program.

France's efforts to quell criticism over what he insists was a ""personal and private"" decision have also been complicated by Trump's continued mentioning of how he's received ""NASCAR's endorsement.""

On Monday, at a North Carolina campaign rally not far from Charlotte Motor Speedway and the headquarters of many top NASCAR teams, Trump was ebullient in describing his backing from the sport. ""You know, I just had a visitor backstage. NASCAR endorsed Trump, can you believe that?"" he asked the crowd.

Except it wasn't NASCAR that made the endorsement. It was France.

""We talked to the campaign about the endorsement that I made, versus the sport, and it's hard to get that perfectly right all the time,"" France said.

Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump's campaign, said in a statement that he spoke broadly because the ""endorsement is from the great Brian France, in addition to several NASCAR drivers.""

In a company-wide email sent last week to all his employees, France reiterated that NASCAR has never had a policy prohibiting employees or competitors from participating in politics, but said that could change in the future.

He told the AP on Wednesday he understands that his endorsement can be viewed as one that comes from NASCAR itself.

""I understand that the family is closely linked with NASCAR. ... We've just always, you've seen politicians come to tracks, and it varies, some Democrats, some are Republicans, all have policies we do and don't agree with,"" he said.

Unusually, one of the seals belonged to a woman, making it an extremely rare find.

Archaeologists found two seals bearing Hebrew names in a large structure built of stone blocks that dates to the First Temple period.

Finding seals that bear names from the time of the First Temple is hardly a commonplace occurrence, and finding a seal that belonged to a woman is an even rarer phenomenon, explained the researchers, in a statement released by the Israel Antiquities Authority.



The seals belonged to Elihana bat Gael, a woman, and Saaryahu ben Shabenyahu, a man. Experts believe the building where the seals were found served as an administrative center.

Related: 7-year-old finds 3,400-year-old figurine in Israel

Seals such as those found in Jerusalem were used to for signing documents and frequently inlaid as part of a ring the owner wore. Elihanas seal is made of semi-precious stone, and contains the mirror-writing of to Elihana bat Gael, inscribed in ancient Hebrew letters. Additionally, they confirmed that Elihanas father's name is also on the seal, which dates back 2,500 years.



Although there is very little additional information on Elihana, expert Hagai Misgav, of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, said the retention of her fathers name indicates that her social status came from her original family rather than her married family.

Under House Bill 4, also known as the Parent Involvement and Accountability Act, teachers would be required to grade parents involvement with their childrens education.

The legislation, by state Rep. Gregory Holloway (D-Hazlehurst), would mandate a section be added to each childs report card on which the parents are graded on their responsiveness to communication with teachers, the students completion of homework and readiness for tests, and the frequency of absences and tardiness.

Mary Clare Reim, research associate on education at the Heritage Foundation, said the bill is the wrong way to encourage more parental involvement.

My initial reaction is, this is absurd, Reim said. The concept that parents should be graded by teachers on their involvement is a reversal of what the education system should look like. Parents should be grading teachers on their performance. Putting grades on parental involvement from the top down is not the way this should work.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Israel investigating police shooting of Palestinian attacker who killed American student,[],"Israel said Thursday it is looking into the shooting death of a Palestinian attacker who killed an American student in a stabbing spree earlier this week.

In Tuesday's attack, the Palestinian assailant ran through the ancient port city of Jaffa with a knife, stabbing several people along his way, until he was shot by a police officer.

Israel's Justice Ministry said the routine check is conducted after every shooting incident by police.

It follows a video that emerged from the scene of the Jaffa stabbing, showing the attacker lying on the ground as an onlooker yells at the officer to shoot him ""in the head."" A sound that appears to be gunfire is heard. Other voices then tell the officer to stop, saying the attacker ""is lying down"" and ""don't shoot him again.""

The Palestinians accuse Israel of using excessive force in trying to subdue more than five months of near-daily Palestinian attacks. The bloodshed  mainly stabbings but also shootings and car-ramming attacks  has killed 28 Israelis and two Americans. During the same time, at least 179 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, a majority of which are said by Israel to have been attackers. The rest were killed in clashes with security forces.

The attack in Jaffa took place as Vice President Joe Biden, on a visit to Israel, was meeting former Israeli President Shimon Peres, at the nearby Peres Center for Peace. The American victim, Taylor Force, was a 28-year-old MBA student at Vanderbilt University and a West Point graduate who had served tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Biden criticized the Palestinians for failing to condemn the stabbing, after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas' political party posted a statement online praising the stabber.

A statement from Abbas' office following his meeting with Biden on Wednesday night said Abbas offered his condolences for the American's death, but stressed that Israel has killed nearly 200 Palestinians during the current round of bloodshed.

In a press conference with the visiting Romanian president Thursday, Abbas did not directly mention the Jaffa attack but said he opposes ""violence, extremism and terrorism regardless of its source.""

Palestinians say the violence stems from frustration at nearly five decades of Israeli occupation. Israel says it is fueled by a campaign of Palestinian incitement compounded on social media sites that glorify and encourage attacks.

U.S. President and CEO Michael Horn is leaving ""to pursue other opportunities effective immediately,"" the automaker said in a statement. He had been with the German auto maker for 25 years, assuming his most recent post in 2014.

Horn's sudden departure comes as the company continues to grapple with the fallout from its admission last year that nearly 600,000 cars were sold in the U.S. with software that regulators say was designed to cheat on required emissions tests.

The company potentially faces more than $20 billion in fines from state and federal regulators, as well as hundreds of class-action lawsuits filed on behalf of angry vehicle owners. The Justice Department is also conducting a criminal investigation.

It was Horn who was sent to apologize to consumers at a congressional hearing in October. But at the same time, he told lawmakers that top corporate officials had no knowledge of the cheating software installed in 11 million diesel cars worldwide.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Thousands gather in Buenos Aires to watch massive glacier collapse,[],"Argentina's massive Perito Moreno glacier this week began the process leading to its cyclical rupture, a spectacular event involving the collapse of huge masses of ice that draw thousands of tourists and that has not happened since 2012.

""The Perito Moreno Glacier began its breakup process. We're waiting! (We) came to experience it firsthand!,"" said the Tourism Secretariat of El Califate, a city some 80 km (50 mi.) from the glacier, Tuesday on Twitter.

Before the big show, a huge number of tourists and the news media began arriving at the Los Glaciares National Park in the southern province of Santa Cruz, which receives some 700,000 tourist each year.

""It's not known how long it's going to take. We only know from earlier experiences. In the last breakups starting from the moment when the outflow starts, which is what happened this morning, the process normally takes ... three or four days,"" park official Matilde Oviedo told EFE.

Pressure from the weight of the ice slowly pushes the glacier over the southern arm of Argentino Lake, damming that area and separating it from the rest of the lake. With no outlet, the water level in that closed-off lake section rises up to 30 meters (100 feet) above the level of the main body of Argentino Lake.

Every few years, the pressure produced by the height of the dammed water breaks through the ice barrier causing a spectacular rupture, sending a huge outpouring of water from the dammed-up section into the main lake area.

The most recent rupture was in March 2012 and the one before that was in 2008.

""Most (ruptures) ... have been at this time of year - at the end of the Southern Hemisphere's summer - but we've also had one in July (in winter). It's quite variable,"" Oviedo said.

Perito Moreno, which covers some 200 square kilometers (about 77 square miles), is located in the Andes, the natural border between Argentina and Chile and is one of the few glaciers in the world that is not receding due to global warming.

The glacier is located in the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, the third-largest concentration of fresh water ice in the world after the two poles.

The Mexican national charged with killing five men in Kansas and Missouri this week was sought by immigration authorities last year, but they sent the detention order to an agency that didn't have him in custody.

It was not the first time Pablo Antonio Serrano-Vitorino, who was in the U.S. illegally, eluded U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

According to the agency, in June 2015 officials from a Kansas county where Serrano-Vitorino faced domestic battery charges queried federal immigration officials about him because he was born outside the country, but ICE didn't respond before the county let him go.

Serrano-Vitorino is now charged with killing a neighbor and three other men on Monday night in Kansas, then gunning down another man Tuesday morning at the man's rural home in central Missouri. He was captured early Wednesday morning.

Serrano-Vitorino, 40, was deported in April 2004 because he was in the country illegally, but he re-entered at some unknown time, ICE said by email.

Serrano-Vitorino, who has been living in Kansas City, Kansas, was fingerprinted Sept. 14 at the Overland Park Municipal Court after being cited for traffic violations. That triggered an ICE order to have him detained. But ICE said it sent the order to the Johnson County Sheriff's Office instead of to the Overland Park Municipal Court.

Court administrator Robin Barnard said Serrano-Vitorino showed up at the court the next month to pay a $146 fine. He was never in custody of any local authorities for the traffic violations.

ICE said that had its order been sent to an agency that had Serrano-Vitorino in custody, it would have sought to deport him.

Earlier last year, Serrano-Vitorino was booked on a misdemeanor domestic battery charge in Kansas City, Kansas. The Wyandotte County Sheriff's Department sent ICE an overnight query about him, sheriff's Lt. Kelli Bailiff said Wednesday, but when ICE did not respond within the required six-hour period, Serrano-Vitorino was released.

ICE said the query, which did not involve his fingerprints, required the agency to interview Serrano-Vitorino, something it wasn't able to do between when the sheriff's office sent it at 1:30 a.m. and released Serrano-Vitorino at 7:30 a.m.

Authorities have not released a motive for the rampage that began Monday.

Wyandotte County District Attorney Jerome Gorman, whose office has charged Serrano-Vitorino with four counts of first-degree murder, declined to discuss a possible motive, saying only that the Kansas killings did not appear drug-related.

Messages left with his Missouri public defender Wednesday were not returned. Serrano-Vitorino is jailed in Montgomery County, Missouri, on $2 million bond stemming from the Kansas charges.

When he was captured, Serrano-Vitorino had an assault-style rifle with him, said John Ham, a regional spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. He said agents were trying to determine how he acquired the weapon.

""If he was in the country illegally, and that certainly appears to be the case, it would have been illegal for him to have a firearm under federal law,"" Ham said.

The Kansas victims were identified as Serrano-Vitorino's neighbor, 41-year-old Michael Capps, and three other men who were at Capps' home: local brothers Austin Harter, 29, and Clint Harter, 27; and 36-year-old Jeremy Waters, of Miami County, Kansas. Before dying, one of the four managed to call police, prompting a manhunt.

The slain Missouri man was 49-year-old Randy Nordman, whose property was about 5 miles from where a truck was found abandoned along Interstate 70 that Serrano-Vitorino was believed to have been driving.

Serrano-Vitorino has had at least one previous conviction  an unspecified terrorist threat for which he was sentenced to two years in a California prison  that led to his 2004 deportation, according to ICE.

ICE also said Serrano-Vitorino was convicted in 2014 of driving under the influence in southeast Kansas. But ICE records don't show the agency was notified that Serrano was fingerprinted at that time.

Gorman, the Kansas prosecutor, declined to criticize ICE on Wednesday, saying he was reserving judgment ""because I don't have all the facts.""

""Obviously we wish it hadn't happened, (and) we'd love to discuss with ICE why it happened,"" he said.

Trump and Cruz, along with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich will get their opportunity to address the thorny topic Thursday when they debate in the Sunshine State.

Clinton and Sanders squared off in their eighth debate Wednesday night held at Miami Dade College in Florida. The Univision/CNN debate is the final one scheduled this month between the candidates in the running for the 2016 Democratic nomination.

During the debate, both Clinton and Sanders vowed to push for immigration reform if elected president.

The essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families, Sanders said.

Clinton says she will extend President Obamas executive orders shielding some illegal immigrants from deportation.

Clinton called the New York businessman un-American and said he traffics in prejudice and paranoia.

Sanders said voters would never elect a candidate like Trump.

Clinton also slammed Trumps plan to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Clinton then turned her sights on Sanders, accusing him of supporting legislation that would have led to indefinite detention of people facing deportation, and for standing with Minutemen vigilantes.

Sanders refuted the notion, which he called ""ridiculous"" and ""absurd,"" and accused Clinton of picking small pieces out of big legislative packages to distort his voting record.

""No, I do not support vigilantes and that is a horrific statement and an unfair statement to make,"" he said, adding: ""I will match my record against yours any day of the week.""

Clinton also dodged early debate questions about ongoing investigations into her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. When debate moderator Jorge Ramos of Univision asked her if she would drop out of the race if indicted over the handling of her email while secretary of state she replied,""Oh for goodness sake, that is not going to happen.

The FBI is investigation the possibility of mishandling of sensitive information that passed through Clinton's private email server.

Sanders, as he has in the past, declined to bite on the issue, saying, ""The process will take its course."" He said he'd rather talk about the issues of wealth and income inequality.

Clinton also defended her role in the deadly 2012 attack on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya.

She said Wednesday that her shifting explanations for the crisis in the early hours were because of changing dynamics and new information.

Clinton also said the investigation has been politicized by Republicans seeking to score points against her campaign.

""This was fog of war,"" she said, saying that she regrets the lives lost in the crisis.

She added: ""I wish there could be an easy answer at the time but we learned a lot.""

Sanders came into Wednesday nights debate after a surprise primary win in Michigan Tuesday, where he had been trailing by more than 20 points in the polls.

Clinton vowed to keep fighting Wednesday, saying, It was a very close race. Ive won some and Ive lost some.

Sanders campaign officials made the case Tuesday night that the Vermont senators attacks on Clintons support for free trade deals had an impact in the Michigan race, and likely will be effective in upcoming contests in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri.

The Sanders camp maintains Clintons advantage in the South will go away after next Tuesday, as rural voters in other states take a closer look at their candidate.

Clinton, though she maintains a healthy lead overall, needs Floridas 99 delegates up for grabs March 15 to help clinch the nomination.

The state Division of Occupational Safety and Health issued nine citations, including four for violations that offered a possibility of serious harm or death, according to an agency statement. It proposed fining Los Angeles-based Third Rock Enterprises Inc. nearly $78,000.

Messages left for Deen, whose real name is Bryan Sevilla, weren't immediately returned.

Deen, 30, arguably is the biggest star in a profession that, until he burst upon the scene 10 years ago, saw its only marquee names belonging to women such as Jenna Jameson and Tori Black. He has also been one of the industry's most outspoken and articulate opponents of condoms in porn films.

Last December, Cal/OSHA began investigating Deen and his company after allegations that the star of thousands of hard-core films sexually assaulted eight porn actresses, including his former girlfriend, on and off movie sets.

Deen has vigorously denied the allegations, and none of the Cal/OSHA violations involve those allegations.

Instead, the agency said investigators visited a film shoot in the Woodland Hills area of Los Angeles on Jan. 12. They found that the producers violated a California law requiring some kind of barrier to protect employees from blood-borne pathogens such as HIV, the agency said.

""Additionally, producers did not provide a vaccine or follow-up medical examination to employees who were potentially exposed to hepatitis B"" and refused to turn over safety records, the Cal/OSHA statement said.

In Los Angeles County, a voter-approved law requires adult film actors to use condoms during film shoots. But many producers have fought the concept, arguing that actors already undergo health screening and audiences are turned off by condoms.

The AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which strongly backed the local condom law and filed the initial complaints that led to the Cal/OSHA investigation of Deen's company, applauded the citations.

Deen ""is the most vocal critic and prominent public face of the industry in its opposition to condom use,"" foundation President Michael Weinstein said in a statement.",[]

Stephayne and Michael Potts spoke to the media for the first time since Artur Samarin was arrested, according to WPMT-TV. Samarin was known in Harrisburg as Asher Potts and was arrested on Feb. 23.

Stephayne Potts told reporters she called the FBI because she was worried that Samarin was going to hurt people at Harrisburg High School.

""He made comments about other shootings, and he told us that everyone would know his name. He said his name would be the biggest in the world,"" she said. ""He started talking about certain kids in school he wanted to hurt. He started talking about blowing he school up.""

Adam Klein, Samarins attorney, refuted the Potts comments. He said there was nothing to believe that Samarin had a violent past.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Trump Could Win Over Some Black Voters,[],"By Joseph Weber, Fox News

Contest after contest has shown Hillary Clinton has the overwhelming support of black voters in the 2016 Democratic primary  but up against Donald Trump, the general election might be a different story.

To be sure, nobody expects Trump or any GOP presidential candidate to win the majority of the black vote, which has been with Democrats since the mid-1930s. Clinton has every reason to believe most black voters sticking with her in the primary against Bernie Sanders would do so in a general election as well.

However, analysts suggest that to consider the black vote a monolith for Clinton in November, should she win the nomination, would be a mistake. The Trump jobs message that has attracted so many disaffected white, blue-collar workers could resonate with black voters equally frustrated by chronic unemployment and unfulfilled promises of change  and Trumps accelerating march toward the GOP nomination has proven his knack for bringing in voters who might not normally pick a Republican.

If anything, he knows the economy, Luz Nelson, a beautician and black South Carolina voter, said days before the front-running Clinton won the state Democratic primary with more than 80 percent of the black vote.",[]

Nationals from at least 51 countries, including the U.K., had to give up their most personal information as they joined the terror organisation. Only when the 23 question form was filled in were they inducted into IS.

A lot of the names and their new Islamic State names on the registration forms are well known.

Abdel Bary, a 26-year-old from London joined in 2013 after visiting Libya, Egypt and Turkey. He is designated as a fighter but is better known in the U.K. as a rap artist. His whereabouts are unknown.

Another jihadi named in the documents, now dead after being targeted in a drone strike, is Junaid Hussain, the head of Islamic State's media wing who along with his wife, former punk Sally Jones, plotted attacks in the U.K. Her whereabouts are unknown.

Reyaad Khan from Cardiff, who also entered in 2013, is also among those found among the registration forms. He was well known for appearing in a highly produced Islamic State propaganda video. He was later killed.

But the key breakthrough from the documents is the revealing of the identities of a number of previously unknown jihadis in the U.K., across northern Europe, much of the Middle East and North Africa, as well as in the United States and Canada.

Their whereabouts are crucial to breaking the organisation and preventing further terror attacks.

Many of the men passed through a series of jihadi ""hotspots"" - such as Yemen, Sudan, Tunisia, Libya, Pakistan and Afghanistan - on multiple occasions, but were apparently unchecked, unmonitored and able to both enter Syria to fight and then to return home.

One of the files marked ""Martyrs"" detailed a brigade manned entirely by fighters who wanted to carry out suicide attacks and were trained to do so.

Some of the telephone numbers on the list are still active and it is believed that although many will be family members, a significant number are used by the jihadis themselves.

The files were passed to Sky News on a memory stick stolen from the head of Islamic State's internal security police, an organisation described by insiders as the group's SS. He had been entrusted to protect the organisation's core secrets and he rarely parted with the drive.

The man who stole it was a former Free Syrian Army convert to Islamic State who calls himself Abu Hamed.

Disillusioned with the Islamic State leadership, he says it has now been taken over by former soldiers from the Iraqi Baath party of Saddam Hussein.

He claims the Islamic rules he believed in have totally collapsed inside the organisation, prompting him to quit.

I met him in a secret location in Turkey, and he said IS was giving up on its headquarters in Raqqa and moving into the central deserts of Syria and ultimately Iraq, the group's birthplace.

He also claimed that in reality Islamic State, The Kurdish YPG and the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, are working together against the moderate Syrian opposition.

Asked if the IS files could bring the network down he nodded and said simply: ""God willing"".

From the attacks in Tunisia and the Bataclan massacre in Paris it is clear that IS is refocusing its base of operations abroad and is intent on carrying out high profile attacks in Western countries, something that security chiefs across Europe are warning about right now.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Failed ObamaCare co-ops have not repaid $1.2B in federal loans, docs say",['Rich Edson'],"EXCLUSIVE: The dozen failed ObamaCare cooperatives have not repaid any of the $1.2 billion in federal loans they received and still owe more than $1 billion in additional liabilities, according to recent financial statements cited Thursday at a congressional hearing.

We shouldnt hold our breath on repayment, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said in his opening statement at the hearing.

In some states, these losses will be absorbed by other insurance companieswhich means, by the policyholders of other insurance companies who have to pay increased ... premiums, he said. In other states, doctors, hospitals and individual patients stand to suffer large out-of-pocket losses due to the co-op failuresas our report details.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

Portmans statement, first obtained by Fox News, refers to an investigation by the committees majority staff.

It claims the most recent balance sheets provided to the subcommittee show the failed cooperatives owe more than $700 million to doctors and hospitals for plan year 2015.

The failed cooperatives lost $376 million and exceeded the projected worst-case-scenario losses outlined in their loan applications by more than $260 million in 2014. They lost an additional billion dollars in 2015, according to the report.

Once the co-ops got going in 2014, things went south in a hurryboth in terms of financial losses and enrollment figures that wildly deviated from the co-ops own projections, Portman said. Despite getting regular reports that the co-ops were hemorrhaging cash, HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] took essentially no corrective action for over a year.

Deloitte Consulting initially granted the cooperatives a passing grade based on an HHS-designed grading scale. However it added seven of the 12 had serious deficiencies in their enrollment strategy, according to the report. Others submitted budgets that were incomplete, unreasonable, not cost-effective and several relied on unreasonable projections about their own growth.

The report cited in Portmans statement also claims that from 20142015, the administration lent an additional $848 million to the failed cooperatives, as they lost more than $1.4 billion.

In previous testimony, administration officials have told congressional panels that the administration scrutinized cooperative business plans and then placed them on corrective oversight when necessary.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

In 2015 we conducted 27 financial and operational reviews, 16 in-person visits, and had 43 formal communications, Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, told the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year. Not to mention hundreds of phone calls. And we've kept the states up to speed on every important interaction to help inform their regulatory actions.

When questioned how much money the government could salvage from the failed cooperatives, officials said they were only beginning to determine amounts.

We are in the process of recouping that loan money right now, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the chief operating officer and chief of staff of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, last month to a House panel. Well look at their excess revenue and then use all the tools available to us through their loan agreements and state and federal law to pull back federal tax dollars.

ObamaCare provided $2.4 billion in federal loans to establish 23 non-profit cooperatives. A dozen failed and the administration has required eight of the remaining eleven to adhere to a corrective action plan designed to fix business flaws and prevent additional failures. The closed cooperatives account for $1.2 billion in federal loans.

Defenders of the law and cooperatives say these non-profit insurers operated in difficult markets and that it often takes years of financial commitment to build a viable business.

The failed cooperatives left hundreds of thousands of customers searching for a new insurance company. In some states, the loss was significant.

HHS gave the New York co-op $90 million to prolong its financial life, rather than allow it to scale down, that co-op went on to lose another $544 million in 2015, according to Portmans statement, citing his staffs report.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner in the Democratic presidential delegate count, pledged she would address the market void left by the failed cooperatives.

We need to get more companies, more nonprofits, to fill this space. The ones that knew what they were doing have provided good services, but a lot of them have failed because they didn't have the right support, she said Monday at a Democratic presidential forum hosted by Fox News.

Even in those markets where those co-ops had previously operated, we have seen a commitment on the part of those who are administering the markets to try to facilitate greater competition, said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. And creating the co-ops was just one way to do that, but we certainly are going to be open to other ways to encourage other entities, private or public, to get engaged in this process.

When previously questioned by Congress, administration officials declined to forecast how many of the remaining cooperatives would survive this year.

The co-ops themselves are really the ones who are going to be the ones to determine whether or not they ultimately will be successful, said Cohen. They have a lot of work to do to rapidly mature their entities, their small businesses as you know and theyre still getting their foothold on this business.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Many hormone doctors feel uncomfortable with transgender patients,[],"People who are transgender may have difficulty finding endocrinologists who feel comfortable and competent in providing needed care, according to a new survey of physicians.

Endocrinologists are often key healthcare providers for people who are transgender. They specialize in the endocrine system, which regulates the body's hormones, and they may prescribe sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen to help transgender patients develop the physical characteristics tied to their gender identity.

But about a third of endocrinologists are unwilling to care for patients who are transgender, and less than half say they feel at least somewhat competent in providing that care, said Dr. Michael Irwig, who surveyed the doctors at an endocrinology meeting last year.

""There is still a big access problem,"" said Irwig, associate professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C. ""The fact that 30 percent won't see transgender patients wouldn't happen with any other diagnosis.""

""Basically, nobody had really done a similar survey before,"" said Irwig, who is also director of the Andrology Center at GW Medical Faculty Associates.

He asked 80 endocrinology providers from Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington, D.C. to answer a 19-item survey. About 80 percent answered the survey.

Overall, 15 percent said they were not at all comfortable discussing gender identity, and another 34 percent said they were only slightly comfortable discussing the subject.

Fifty-eight percent reported being less comfortable with transgender patients than with non-transgender patients.

Fellowship training on transgender care was uncommon, reported by less than one-third of the doctors overall and by 58 percent of those ages 25 to 39.

Only 41 percent of participants felt at least somewhat competent in providing care to transgender people.

And only 63 percent said transgender patients could be seen at their practice. Irwig said he asked participants to explain why such patients couldn't be seen, ""but a lot of them didn't fill in that open-ended question.""

He told Reuters Health there could be a number of reasons for doctors refusing to see transgender patients, including prejudice, lack of understanding and not feeling competent in providing the needed care.

More training and experience may help improve healthcare access, said Irwig.

The Endocrine Society is updating its 2009 guidelines for caring for people who are transgender. The guidelines provide guidance and legitimacy, said Dr. Josh Safer, who is working on the update.

""The guidelines are an evidence-based, thoughtful approach from the ultimate mainstream endocrinology professional society and that is very strong for those needing reliable sources,"" said Safer, of the Boston University School of Medicine, in an email to Reuters Health.

The updated guidelines include changes to terminology, new practices on how to care for transgender adolescents and how transgender care fits within the larger medical community, he added in a phone interview.

Irwig said transgender people likely know healthcare access is an issue. To find endocrinologists who can provide culturally competent care, he suggests that patients calling doctors' offices ""ask their staff how many transgender patients are seen in the practice, because that will give them a good idea.""

Safer said he considers it a priority to train endocrinologists in transgender medical care. He is educating his own trainees on the subject.

""However, this is a long process,"" he said.",[]

Judge John Hlophe in Cape Town convicted the woman of kidnapping, fraud and contravening child protection laws, said Eric Ntabazalila, spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority. The judge revoked bail and the woman will be detained until her May 30 sentencing, he said.

Your story if anything is a fairy tale and the court rejects it with the contempt it deserves, Hlophe told the grim-faced woman, according to Sky News. He ordered that neither the defendant nor the girl may be identified.

Hlophe mentioned in court that the woman could be looking at a 10-year prison sentence.

The girl's biological mother, Celeste Nurse, sobbed loudly as the verdict was delivered amid chants of Yes! Yes! from the public gallery inside the courtroom, Sky News reported.

State prosecutors said the woman snatched the three-day-old baby from her sleeping mother's hospital bedside in Cape Town in April 1997. The prosecution also said the woman defrauded authorities when she registered the child as her own daughter in 2003, also changing her birthdate.

The defendant, now 51, pleaded not guilty to all three charges. During the trial she testified that she adopted the child.

""I didn't know the baby was stolen,"" the woman testified, according to the African News Agency.

The woman had told the court in earlier proceedings that she had adopted the baby after struggling with infertility. She said she was not aware the child was kidnapped. The woman who facilitated the adoption told her a young woman had given the child up, she said.

The girl reportedly was reunited with her biological parents, Morne and Celeste Nurse, last year after their second daughter befriended a girl at school who looked remarkably like her. After a police investigation and DNA tests, that new friend turned out to be the Nurses' missing child.

The biological parents sobbed as the judge read the verdict, ANA reported, capping off an emotional trial.

Morne Nurse, the girl's biological father, told the court in February that he was crying my heart out in the fetal position on the day the baby disappeared.

The girl, now 18, was not in court and is taking high school final exams.

You could cab downtown to The Palm for a power lunch of steak au poivre and fried onions. Slide out the side door of the Dirksen Senate Office Building and across the parking lot to the legendary Monocle for braised lamb chops.

But sometimes, if youre a Republican senator, its simpler to just grab a bite with your GOP colleagues in the Mike Mansfield Room of the Capitol.

Yet even this is becoming a complicated media event thanks to the unpredictable presidential primary battle -- as reporters these days camp out in the Senate subway station, firing off a battery of questions to lunch-driven lawmakers about the apparent doom which supposedly looms for the Republican Party this year.

Donald Trump this. Ted Cruz that. Marco Rubio. Did someone say Kasich?

Major primaries in Ohio and Florida are on the horizon next week. The results could set the table for this campaign cycle. The House of Representatives isnt in session this week. So every reporter in Washington worth their byline made a beeline for the Capitol to query senators about the presidential race.

The hand-operated train which runs to the Russell Senate Office Building pulls in. Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and John McCain, R-Ariz., pile out. Reporters flock to McCain. Both are up for re-election this year. Burr, despite representing a swing state, somehow escapes the crew and hoofs it upstairs to the weekly GOP luncheon, practically incognito.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.  often a target for a press gaggle on intelligence and firearm issues  walks by with barely a notice.

Democrats arent important this week. Only Republicans.

This weeks reporter scrums in the Senate subway station were intense.

Some are starting to suggest that Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, may be the only person who can short-circuit Donald Trump en route to the Republican nomination. And yet not a single GOP senator has endorsed their colleague. That phenomenon is practically unheard of in American politics.

There was a rumor four senators were going to endorse Ted Cruz, said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. But that rumor was unfounded.

Four senators. Zero senators. It doesnt seem to matter much. Republican senators dont like Ted Cruz  even if some grudgingly concede he may be the only person capable of defeating Trump. And not everyone is sure Cruz is better than Trump.

Collins believes Cruz needs a Dale Carnegie course.

Im not sure Ted has developed relationships in the Senate, said Collins. Some of his rhetoric toward the Republican leader has not been conducive.

Last summer, Cruz raged on the floor about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., trade policy and an effort to renew the controversial Export-Import Bank.

I cannot believe that [McConnell] would tell a flat-out lie, steamed Cruz. We now know that when the majority leader looks us in the eyes and makes an explicit commitment that he is willing to say things that he knows are false.

Some Republicans  especially those in leadership or tenuous political positions  tried to take the high road with Cruz.

Teds a smart guy, said Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune, R-S.D. His tenure in the Senate has been him trying to be a disruptor.

And it was that disruption which seems to have turned off many of his Senate colleagues.

He was leading the government shutdown, said Collins. It was a disaster in every way.

Expectations were created that somehow we could win, echoed Thune of the shutdown.

Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., faced a competitive primary a few weeks ago. Republicans pumped significant monetary and human resources into the state at the end to close the deal for Shelby. Colleague Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., is the only senator to endorse Donald Trump. Shelby wasnt in much of a mood to talk shop Tuesday when a mob of reporters waited for him to disembark from the Senate trolley.

Im going to lunch right now, said Shelby brusquely brushing past the throng.

Things were almost as hectic on Wednesday as senators cruised past reporters from the subway station en route to a midday procedural vote. Only, there was no formal lunch planned this time. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., is also a vulnerable GOPer this cycle who hails from a swing state. But Johnson didnt feel accosted by reporters as he walked to one of the subways.

Im happy to answer questions, said Johnson. Or not answer, as the case may be.

He chuckled.

Would Trump or Cruz take a pragmatic approach to governing?

Im praying, replied Johnson.

Perhaps that means senators should say grace before lunch  regardless of where they decide to eat.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Why Republican voters are in revolt over corporate crony trade deals,['Richard Manning'],"The Michigan primary results on Tuesday signal a quantum shift in GOP voter attitudes on free trade policies that have served corporate crony agendas leaving the American people behind.

Thats not just analysis, it is fact based upon a just released Americans for Limited Government survey conducted by independent pollster Patrick Caddell. The stunning results of the Caddell study showed that GOP voters reject the global trade agenda at an even higher rate than Democrat voters, throwing conventional wisdom on its ear.

The ramifications for President Obamas ill-conceived Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) could not be more ominous. When asked in an informed question about whether the TPP should be passed in a lame duck Congress, Republican voters oppose it by a 66 to 15 margin, far outstripping Democrat or Independent opposition.

This represents a quantum shift in anticipated political party attitudes on an issue where Republican members of Congress could be counted upon to salute in almost lock-step in favor of any legislation labeled free trade.

The conversion point for Republican voters comes from a strong sense that the system is rigged against them in favor of the corporate cronies who manipulate the law to benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else.

Caddell found that GOP voters view the results of the free trade agreements over the past two decades serve as the primary indictment against any new agreement with a 59 percent saying that previous deals were more of a benefit to other countries, and a startlingly low 4 percent agreeing that free trade deals have been more of a benefit to the U.S. and only 14 percent who said they were equally beneficial to all.

The economic facts over the past two decades bear out GOP voters dismissal of the notion that trade deals help the United States. The year 2000 was the last year that the U.S. economy grew at 4 percent or above, and not coincidentally, the same year the U.S. granted China permanent normal trade relations.

What makes the current skepticism even more acute is the fact that the U.S. economy has not even grown at a 3 percent level since 2005, and the past ten years have had the worst level of GDP growth since the Great Depression as labor participation among working age adults has collapsed.

When asked in an informed question about whether Congress should pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership in a lame duck session as has been proposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, GOP voters answer with a resounding no, opposing passage of the deal by a 66 to 15 percent margin.

Republican power brokers, consultants and elites have been confounded by the utter rejection of every presidential candidate who has chosen to take on their mantle in this election season with Marco Rubios last place finishes in both Michigan and Mississippi providing the latest evidence. Caddell finds that GOP voters flat out dont trust their leaders to look out for the national or their own individual interests with 85 percent agreeing with the statement that, political leaders are more interested in protecting their power and privilege than doing what is right for the American people.

This stark wake-up call for GOP leadership is devastating, but it is survivable if they are willing to take stands that demonstrate that they are fighting to restore America.

In this regard, the GOP Senates decision to stand firm against allowing President Obama to fundamentally change the make-up of the Supreme Court rather than relying upon a vote of the people to make that decision is a great first step.

Every Republican candidate for President and Congress, should forcefully reject the notion of passing Obamas Trans-Pacific Partnership with a particular disdain for bringing it up in a lame duck when many of their colleagues will be looking for their next jobs rather than looking out for the interests of the American people.

By rejecting the status quo trade agenda of the D.C. elites, Congress will show the independence that their political base is looking for, reconnecting by taking a stand against those who are pulling the strings with no regard for the plight of Americans or America itself.

It is no secret that Republican voters are in outright revolt, they are tired of their prosperity being traded away and their childrens futures being diminished as our nations wealth gets transferred around the world to benefit corporate cronies with the pull to gain favor, and nations that dont like us very much.

They have caught on to the big lie that these trade agreements benefit them or America, and now it is time for GOP leaders to follow them and reject the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the latest in a long line of bad trade deals.

Three people drowned in Oklahoma, Texas and Louisiana.

In Bienville Parish, authorities said a man died and a woman was being treated for injuries after their car was swept off a flooded Louisiana road Wednesday and into a creek. In rural southeastern Oklahoma, a 30-year-old man drowned Tuesday night after trying to drive his SUV across a low-crossing bridge covered by floodwater. In Texas, a 22-year-old man drowned Monday night after his canoe capsized in Dickinson Bayou, southeast of Houston near Galveston Bay.

In Bossier City, 3,500 homes were evacuated as a precaution because a bayou was approaching the top of its levee. National Weather Service meteorologist Jason Hansford said Thursday morning that the bayou may top the levee or be breached.

Heavy rain continued across much of north Louisiana on Wednesday night and early Thursday morning with another 3 inches, Hansford said.

State police report several sections of Interstate 20 were closed from Bossier City to near Gibsland in north central Louisiana.

The forecast is for the rain to end by Friday afternoon. Flash flood watches remained in effect for areas from Port O'Connor, Texas, to near Springfield, Illinois.

Air Force Tech Sgt. Drew Scott and another military friend brought in a boat Wednesday to help evacuate up to 200 mobile homes in the Pecan Valley Estates community in Bossier Parish. Scott said he had gone in his truck earlier Wednesday to pick up his in-laws but couldn't get into the park.

""Water, coming up from the Flat River, was waist deep or higher and going into the houses. There were lots of cars flooded out. At the deepest point, I'd say, it was up to my chest and I'm 6 feet,"" he said.

Scott said he and his friend assisted the sheriff's office, firefighters and others in getting those who were stranded out of harm's way.

""When things like this happen, people start helping others and that helps restore faith in the country and humanity,"" he said. ""That's the way I was raised and the way I raise my family. I would hope that if the shoe was on the other foot and I needed help that someone would do the same for me.""

Sharon Anderson, her three children and four grandchildren were rescued from her south Bossier Parish mobile home after rising water threatened to trap them. Several other families already had been trapped, and the water was still rising, she said.

""This morning it was touching the bottom of the houses,"" she said. ""Now the steps on my back porch are under water, and if you walk down the driveway, it's over the knee.""

Anderson said they were pretty much surrounded by the water. The road into the area is flooded and another outlet that has a bridge is closed because of water.

""We're literally trapped,"" Anderson said. ""You have to get a boat to get to our doors in this neighborhood.""

Several Louisiana parishes have declared a state of emergency, and the National Guard was sent in to help.

Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards issued the order affecting Acadia, Bienville, Bossier, Caddo, Claiborne, Desoto, East Carroll, Grant, Lincoln, Morehouse, Ouachita, Red River, Richland, Union, Webster and West Carroll parishes after nearly a foot of rain fell Tuesday night and Wednesday.

Louisiana State Police closed a section of Interstate 20 near Gibsland after both the eastbound and westbound lanes were covered with a foot of water, making the road impassible.

Meteorologist Matthew Duplantis of the National Weather Service in Shreveport said Wednesday rain brought an additional 2 to 4 inches to the area.

Northwestern State University's campuses in Natchitoches and Shreveport will be closed Thursday due to weather conditions, as are Bossier Parish public schools.

Over southeast Louisiana, including the New Orleans metro area, forecasters say the slow-moving low pressure system was expected to bring a few rounds of heavy rainfall beginning Thursday morning and continue through early Saturday. Rainfall totals could reach 10 inches in some areas and could result in some flooding.",[]

HOUSTON (AP) The Houston Texans filled their biggest need, starting free agency with a splash by snagging Brock Osweiler from Denver.

The quarterback arrived in Houston in the evening after agreeing to a four-year contract reportedly worth $72 million and will be introduced in Houston on Thursday.

The Broncos hoped to keep Osweiler in the wake of Peyton Manning's retirement on Monday. Instead he's joining the Texans who were looking to upgrade the position after Brian Hoyer's struggles last season, particularly his turnover-filled performance in their wild-card playoff loss to Kansas City.

The Texans also made other upgrades to their offense, agreeing to deals with running back Lamar Miller and offensive linemen Jeff Allen and Tony Bergstrom. Houston needed a running back after releasing franchise rushing leader Arian Foster last week.

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - New Tennessee general manager Jon Robinson made his first big move in rebuilding the woeful Titans.

And acquiring the NFL's 2014 Offensive Player of the Year DeMarco Murray cost only a new contract for the running back and a simple swap of fourth-round draft picks with Philadelphia.

The Titans confirmed the trade and tweeted out a photo of Murray signing his new deal. Murray will be introduced at a news conference Thursday.

TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - The prospect of leaving the Tampa Bay Buccaneers never really appealed to All-Pro running back Doug Martin.

Heading into his fifth-season, the top player at his position in free agency agreed to terms of a five-year contract worth more than $35 million, with $15 million guaranteed.

The 27-year-old two-time Pro Bowl selection has had two outstanding seasons with the Bucs in addition to two injury-filled years. In 2015, he rushed for 1,402 yards, second in the NFL, and six touchdowns. His 4.87-yard average was the highest in team history.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Defensive end Charles Johnson has agreed to take a major pay cut to return to the Carolina Panthers.

Fullback Mike Tolbert isn't going anywhere, either.

The Panthers announced Johnson, a nine-year NFL veteran, has re-signed with the team after being released last week in a salary cap move. Johnson received a one-year contract worth $3 million to return to the NFC champions, according to his agent, Drew Rosenhaus.

Tolbert, an All-Pro fullback, signed a two-year deal.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL

NEW YORK (AP) - Jay Wright and Kris Dunn made some Big East historyand both were humbled by it.

Wright, who led Villanova to a first-place finish in the Big East, was named co-coach of the year along with Seton Hall's Kevin Willard. It is the fifth time - and third in a row - that Wright was honored by his fellow coaches.

This award breaks a tie with Jim Boeheim of Syracuse and former Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun for the most in conference history.

ST. LOUIS (AP) - Outdoor hockey is coming to St. Louis.

The NHL announced before the St. Louis Blues' shootout win against the Chicago Blackhawks that the teams will play in the Winter Classic at Busch Stadium on Monday, Jan. 2.

St. Louis will be the eighth franchise to host the Winter Classic. The game is usually held on Jan. 1, but the league is pushing it back a day as it did in 2012 to avoid going head-to-head with the NFL.

NEW YORK (AP) - The NHL announced the Toronto Maple Leafs will host the Detroit Red Wings in the Centennial Classic on New Year's Day to celebrate the league's 100th anniversary.

The outdoor game will take place at BMO Field, home of Major League Soccer's Toronto FC and the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts. It's a rematch of the 2014 Winter Classic, which was held at Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor.

TORONTO (AP) - The New York Islanders will be without starting goalie Jaroslav Halak for the next six weeks due to a lower body injury.

Halak left the Islanders' 2-1 win over Pittsburgh on Tuesday night with 4:22 remaining with an apparent groin injury. New York coach Jack Capuano announced the expected length of the Halak's absence Wednesday before the team's 4-3 shootout loss to the Maple Leafs.

Thomas Greiss, who finished the win over the Penguins to help Halak get his 200th career victory, will likely get the bulk of the starts the rest of the regular season and into the start of the playoffs.

The shooting unfolded late Wednesday at a house on Franklin Avenue in Wilkinsburg, just east of downtown Pittsburgh. Four people were killed on the home's back porch, Allegheny County Lt. Andrew Schurman said. A fifth person died from her injuries at a local hospital.

Allegheny County police said two injured men were in critical condition early Thursday, while a woman was in stable condition.

Schurman described the gathering at the home as ""a backyard party or cookout of some sort"", but did not elaborate further. He said gunshots came from two distinct locations but police don't believe anyone at the party fired back.



""It looks like right now they were all fleeing toward the back door of the residence when the second gunman fired from the side of the yard,"" he said. ""They all seemed to get caught on the back porch.""



It wasn't clear why the gunmen may have opened fire.

Wilkinsburg is a poorer, largely blighted suburb known for drug trafficking and gun violence. But, neighbors described the street on which the shooting occurred as generally quiet and expressed shock. They said they heard between 20 and 25 gunshots.

""It went on for almost a minute,"" James Boyd told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. ""I thought it was maybe the pipes bursting. But then we realized it was gunshots. We've had trouble in this neighborhood before but never this close to home.""

An unidentified woman who said she lived one house away from the shooting scene told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that her neighbors had a cookout earlier in the day and were still in their backyard when the shots rang out.

""It sounded like a war,"" she said.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Pope imposes financial oversight for saints after abuses,[],"Pope Francis imposed new financial accountability regulations on the Vatican's multimillion-dollar saint-making machine Thursday after gross abuses were revealed in two books.

The rules require external vigilance over individual Vatican bank accounts created for beatification and canonization causes, as well as regular budgeting and accounting to make sure the donations from the faithful are being used as intended.

The reforms were imposed after Francis tasked a fact-finding commission to investigate Vatican expenditures. Two books by Italian journalists, based on the commission's confidential findings, revealed that the Vatican's secretive saint-making process brought in hundreds of thousands of euros in donations for each saintly candidate but had virtually no financial oversight as to how the money was spent.

The books estimated the average cost for each beatification at around $550,000, with much of the proceeds going to a few lucky people with contracts to do the often time-consuming investigations into the candidates' lives.

While candidates who inspire wealthy donors would sprint ahead, those with less wealthy fans would languish.

The new rules call for an administrator to be named for each saintly cause who must ""scrupulously respect"" the intention of each donation. The administrator must keep a running tab on expenditures and donations, prepare an annual budget and be subject to the oversight of the local bishop or religious superior. That person must approve the annual budget and send it to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints  the Vatican office responsible for reviewing saintly candidates, investigating miracles and preparing the cases for the pope's ultimate decision.

The rules also set out the mechanism by which each cause pays the congregation for its services finalizing the beatification or canonization, though it doesn't specify how much is given. Once the candidate is made a saint, the congregation decides what to do with any remaining funds, including sending them to a special solidarity account for less-well funded candidates.

The Catholic Church makes saints to give the faithful role models. The process is cloaked in secrecy and open to criticism, given that it deals with science-defying miracles and notoriously politicized choices. Pope John Paul II  himself canonized in near-record time in 2014  declared 482 saints in his quarter-century papacy, more than all of his predecessors combined.

In the early church, saints were often made by papal decree or popular acclaim. Over the centuries, the process has become far more detailed, legalistic, time-consuming and costly.

It usually starts in the diocese where the candidate lived or died. A postulator  essentially the cheerleader spearheading the project  gathers testimony and documentation to build the case and presents the report to the congregation. If the Vatican's experts agree the candidate lived a virtuous life, the case is forwarded to the pope who signs a decree attesting to the candidate's ""heroic virtues.""

Over time, the postulator may come across information that someone was miraculously healed by praying for God's intercession through the candidate. If the cure cannot be medically explained, the case is presented to the congregation as the possible miracle needed for beatification, the first major step in the sainthood process. Panels of doctors, theologians, bishops and cardinals must certify that the cure was instantaneous, complete and lasting  and was due to the intercession of the candidate. If convinced, the congregation sends the case to the pope who signs a decree saying the candidate can be beatified. A second miracle is needed for canonization.

Martyrs, or people who were killed for their faith, get a free pass and can be beatified without a miracle. A miracle is needed, however, for martyrs to be canonized.

Given the steps involved, the costs associated with the process can vary widely. If the postulator needs to travel around the world to gather testimony and documentation for the investigation or miracle hunt, the costs will be greater than for a candidate whose life can be investigated closer to home. A big-name candidate, such as a modern-day pope, will likely generate a far more in-depth investigation than a 5th-century hermit for whom there is limited documentation.

The rules were published just days before Francis is due to set the official date for his next big canonization: Mother Teresa. She's expected to be made a saint in the first week of September as part of Francis' Holy Year of Mercy celebrations.

Almost all of them celebrities in the world of politics. Only one had no chance to win -- according to the experts. He was thought of as a clown, politically incorrect, offensive, and had zero political experience at any level. Ninety-nine percent of the experts predicted hed never even file his financials with the FEC.

Surprise. Meet the winner of ""Celebrity Apprentice Special Political Edition"": Donald J. Trump.

As of Tuesday night Trump added Mississippi, Michigan and Hawaii to his trophy case. It wasnt even close. Trump dominated. And hes leading by a mile in the two remaining jewels needed to put this race away.

Trump leads Florida by a landslide over Florida Senator Marco Rubio. He has a commanding lead in Ohio over Ohio Governor Kasich.

How could the national media, political experts and commentators get it so wrong? The guy who never ran for office, let alone served in office, just beat out a mob of Washington insiders whove played the political game their entire lives.

Its almost as if Trump was toying with the entire political process. Its almost like it was a big game to him. It was almost as if he thought he was smarter than everyone else and he could play the game at a higher level. Almost.

Trump was the guy who supposedly only knew how to win a national television reality competition called Celebrity Apprentice. Heck, he designed the game. He produced the game. He sat in the boardroom and analyzed the tactics of the participants of the game. He crowned the winner among a mob of candidates each time.

Is it possible that Celebrity Apprentice was the perfect preparation for a presidential run? Is it possible Trump is smarter than all of us? Did he figure out that politics is exactly like a TV reality show competition? Did he design the perfect winning strategy based on Celebrity Apprentice?

Think about it. This political reality competition started with 17 contestants, a veritable Whos Who of national politics:

* 9 governors or former governors, including the Chairman of the Republican Governors Association: Chris Christie of New Jersey, John Kasich of Ohio, Jeb Bush of Florida, Jim Gilmore of Virginia, Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, George Pataki of New York, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Scott Walker of Wisconsin and Rick Perry of Texas.

* 5 Washington, D.C. U.S. Senate celebrities: United States Senators: Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Rand Paul, Rick Santorum and Lindsey Graham.

*And three miscellaneous celebrities -- billionaire businessman Donald Trump; world-renowned brain surgeon and best-selling author Dr. Ben Carson; and businesswoman and CEO Carly Fiorina, a former CEO of Hewlett Packard and U.S. Senate candidate in California.

Today 16 contestants have gone dark. There is only one man left standing. There is no serious path to victory for anyone but Donald J. Trump -- the man who had never before played the Washington political game. The man who had never before run for office. The man who had never served a day in office. The man who ran his campaign without pollsters, strategists or consultants.

Experts called him crazy and extreme and unelectable.

Former GOP Presidential nominee Mitt Romney called him a fraud and conman.

Polls found he had the highest negatives of any candidate in modern political history.

Through it all he spent almost nothing. He ran the entire campaign on free media and his skills as the world's greatest branding expert.

And hes the one left standing. Hes the victor. Not by an inch. By a mile. Trump dominated.

Maybe its time to admit Trump is no dummy. Maybe Trump knew exactly what he was doing from day one. Maybe hes smarter than all the political experts in the media. Maybe hes smarter than all the political strategists and consultants in Washington D.C. Maybe hes smarter than all the politicians. Maybe he's just playing at a higher level than the rest of us.

Maybe he devised the perfect plan to win the ultimate grueling reality show competition- the race for President of the United States.

Its time to face the fact: Donald Trump will be the 2016 GOP presidential nominee. I hope Hillary Clinton is ready to play Celebrity Apprentice.

My prediction: Hillary doesnt have the skills to compete in this game.

Markets in the U.S. were pulled in two directions as traders parsed a monetary policy decision from the European Central Bank, and oil prices dropped.

Early Thursday, the ECB announced it would expand its monetary stimulus efforts. The central bank cut its benchmark interest rate further into negative territory by 0.10% to -0.40%, which means banks will continue to have to pay the ECB to hold onto their deposits. Meanwhile, the central bank slashed its refinancing rate to zero from 0.05%, while the marginal lending rate was lowered to 0.25% from 0.30%.

In addition, the ECB expanded its quantitative easing program, in which the central bank buys government bonds and other securities, by 20 billion euros to 80 billion euros a month. The QE program was also expanded to include investment-grade corporate bonds, rather than just bank bonds.

ECB President Mario Draghi, in a press conference following the policy decision, said rates will stay very low for a long period of time and well past the horizon of the central banks purchases. Still, he said he didnt anticipate that it would be necessary for the ECB to reduce rates further into negative territory, though facts can change the situation and outlook.

In the wake of Draghis comments, the euro sharply reversed declines of more than 1%, rising 0.39% against the U.S. dollar, while European equities moved higher. The Euro Stoxx 50, which tracks large-cap companies in the eurozone, jumped 3.25%, while the German Dax climbed 2.51%, the French CAC 40 added 2.73%, and the UKs FTSE 100 rose 0.57%.

Peter Kenny, senior market strategist at Global Markets Advisory Group, said while markets are rallying, its important to keep in mind that the reason behind the momentum is a need by the central bank to continue stimulating the economy.

The EU is really in a position where there is no other driver of global growth. They need as much accommodation and facilitation as possible, he said.

While ECB President Mario Draghi has insisted tools remain in the box to continue efforts to spur consumers to spend and investors to feel confident, Kenny said beyond cutting rates and expanding QE, theres not much more than can be done.

The lack of confidence is really what the ECB is trying to not only tackle, but overcome. Trying to get people to think differently about their future and how they can confidently spend more money...Draghi has done an extraordinary job keeping this thing afloat, but the primary reason is he convinced people they do have other tools. Its worrisome, he said.

Elsewhere, investors in the U.S. kept an eye on a trickle of economic data. Weekly jobless claims dropped more than expected last week. Data from the Labor Department showed the number of Americans filing for first-time unemployment benefits fell to 259,000 from a downwardly revised 277K the week prior. Wall Street expected claims to fall to 275,000 from an initially reported 278,000.

Global oil prices saw sharp declines after a media report said a rumored meeting among oil producers to discuss a production freeze at January levels is unlikely to happen later this month. The idea of an output freeze was floated last month by Venezuela, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar, but focus has remained on Iran  arguably a nation to see production levels increase substantially this year  which has stayed mum on whether it would join the pact. Sources told Reuters only when Iran agrees to come to the table will a deal be possible.

On the news, West Texas Intermediate crude prices dropped 2.06% to $37.48 a barrel. Brent crude prices shed 2.70% to $39.96 a barrel.

Metals were mostly higher as gold prices added 0.39% to $1,262 a troy ounce. Silver added 0.77% to $15.49 an ounce, while copper declined 0.69% to $2.21 a pound.

Meanwhile, the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds declined 0.011 percentage point to 1.881%. Yields move in the opposite direction of prices.",[]

I say this as a conservative who has fought many fights as the GOPs chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, including for the judicial nominations of Miguel Estrada, Brett Kavanagh and Priscilla Owens, among others. The idea of the party not coalescing behind the eventual nominee would simply be mad. Theres too much at stake.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Trump says GOP opposition to him 'taking advantage of our country',[],"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump pushed back Wednesday night against what appears to be a growing movement among the party establishment  including a few of his former rivals  to at least slow down his march to the convention with enough delegates in hand to claim the nomination.

Speaking with Sean Hannity on a special Fox News town hall, Trump accused GOP lawmakers opposed to his campaign of ""taking advantage of our country.""



The billionaire businessman called his campaign a movement ""of competence and common sense and low taxes and [secure] borders and it would be so foolish to give it away.""

Trump was referring to a conference held by the conservative American Enterprise Institute at Sea Island off the coast of Georgia over the weekend, where one of the topics reportedly was stopping Trump from securing the Republican nomination.

The conference reportedly was attended by Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other key Republican congressmen.

""I know all these people,"" Trump told Hannity. ""These are people that are taking advantage of our country. They dont want to have strong borders. They want stuff flowing across the borders. They dont want to have taxation when countries treat us unfairly because they benefit from that.""

""Politicians will do whats right for the people that gave them the money,"" Trump added later, ""not what's right for the country.""

Former GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush also planned to meet with Trump's rivals on Thursday ahead of a GOP debate in Florida, fueling speculation that he's preparing to endorse a candidate challenging Trump.

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, meanwhile, told Fox News that he would not drop out of the Republican presidential race before next week's Florida primary, saying, ""we're gonna fight this thing through Tuesday ... and we're going to go on.""

Rubio denied multiple reports that he had discussed the possibility of dropping out before the winner-take-all contest.

Speaking with Fox News Megyn Kelly, Rubio said: ""I have never discussed dropping out with anyone on my team, or anyone on the planet Earth ... I'm the only one who can beat Donald Trump in Florida.

A Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Rubio trailing Trump by 23 percentage points among likely Republican voters in Florida.

""I honestly dont believe Donald Trump will be the nominee,"" Rubio said. ""I continue to believe it's going to be me, and it's got to start here in Florida.""

Rubio also dismissed the possibility that he would form a so-called ""unity"" Republican ticket with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump's closest challenger in the delegate race, calling it "" the kind of drama that makes it interesting in TV to speculate about.""

""At some point we're all going to team up,"" Rubio said in reference to the non-Trump candidates. ""We're all going to be on the same team, I hope.

Cruz told Kelly that Rubio and Kasich were ""good, honorable people, but neither of them has a path to the nomination.""

""Head-to-head, not only do I beat Donald Trump,"" Cruz said, ""but I defeat him resoundingly.""

Cruz also walked back his earlier opposition to a possible convention fight between himself and Trump if neither man reaches the required 1,237 delegates during the primaries.

""Look, [Ronald] Reagan and [President Gerald] Ford battled it out at a contested convention [in 1976],"" Cruz said. ""That's what conventions are for."" However, Cruz restated his opposition to a so-called brokered convention, calling it ""a fever dream of the D.C. establishment"" and warning of ""an open revolt"" among Republican voters if it came to pass.

Cruz later turned his rhetorical fire against Trump and Rubio over immigration reform and the so-called ""Gang of Eight"" bill in 2013.

""When Marco Rubio stood with Barack Obama and [Sen.] Chuck Schumer and [then-Senate Majority Leader] Harry Reid ... I stood with millions of Americans,"" Cruz told Kelly. ""Not only was Donald Trump nowhere to be found, he was funding the Gang of Eight. He gave $50,000 to five of its members.""

Cruz also accused Rubio of lowering the tone of the campaign, saying, ""I have no views whatsoever on any part of Donald Trumps anatomy,"" an apparent reference to Rubio jabbing Trump's ""small hands"" at a Virginia campaign stop.

For his part, Rubio told Megyn Kelly that he regretted the remark, saying ""my kids were embarrassed by it, my wife didnt like it, I dont think it reflects [well]; thats not who I am.""

Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has staked his campaign's future on victory in next Tuesday's Ohio primary, told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren that he would ""probably not"" pick up enough delegates in other contests to overtake Trump, but noted that voters had only ""picked about half the delegates [so far] this year ... anything is possible.""

A Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Kasich leading Trump by five percentage points among likely Republican voters in the Buckeye State.

""We're going to win Ohio,"" Kasich told Van Susteren. ""That's not even a question for me. It's about what we do after that and all the places we have to go. But we're not taking it for granted.""

Trump has 458 delegates to Cruz's 359 following Tuesday's contests, in which Trump won the Mississippi and Michigan primaries as well as the Hawaii caucus. Cruz also picked up a win in the Idaho primary. Rubio is a distant third with 151 delegates, while Kasich has 54.",[]

Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Ed Royce introduced a bill last week to bar such an outrageous giveaway.

Of course, Royces bill is likely to face a presidential veto. As a practical matter, the surest way to prevent the president from surrendering Guantanamo is to keep its military detention facility loaded with prisoners. The president cant relinquish it until its empty.

Your immigration plan is that you would expand President Obamas executive action and you would push for legislation that would push for legislation that would include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Salinas said. So are you flip-flopping on this issue or are you pandering to Latinos...what some would call Hispandering.

.@HillaryClinton is asked if she's ""Hispandering."" pic.twitter.com/aFbnEctk5s  POLITICO (@politico) March 10, 2016

While the term drew laughter from the crowd, Hispandering  the increasing effort by politicians on both sides of the political divide to court Latino voters by favoring more lenient immigration policies and other issues important to the community  has drawn criticism from many activists who say politicians are only looking for votes and will not follow through with the promises.

Defenders of efforts that have been targeted as pandering say critics unfairly are implying that its somehow wrong to talk to Latinos about their concerns and show support for policies and solutions that a majority of them favor.

With 54 million Hispanics in America, you have to wonder why anyone would question their role in our democracy, said Pablo Manriquez, the director of Hispanic media for the Democratic National Committee. And every candidate seriously wanting to represent them should reach out, talk about the issues that matter to us like college affordability, and ask for our vote. Thats as American as apple pie.

Allert Gort-Brown, a professor at the University of Notre Dame, told Fox News Latino that pandering is often a pejorative way to describe a core practice of political campaigns.

In general, its just political campaigning, Gort-Brown said. People said that Marco Rubio was pandering to the tea party. Is Hillary Clinton pandering to labor when she says shes against [the Trans-Pacific Partnership]? Well, yes.

He pointed out that social conservatives stress their faith-based outlook in order to make sure they capture those votes when theyre in the primary.

Where it gets unsavory, experts admit, is when candidates treat a bloc as a monolithic group, or when they appear to contradict themselves in their effort to reach a new sector of the electorate.

Its what someone called Hispandering, taking an advertisement and throwing some mariachis in there to 'reach out' to Hispanics, Gort-Brown told FNL.Its not wrong to reach out to Latinos or any discernable voting bloc. Its when they treat Latinos as if theyre all Mexicans and all listen to mariachis.

The broader issue is, 'Should they be reaching out to Latinos?,'"" he said. ""You want to win an election, and you want to get as many people as you can on board. And Latinos are just growing too fast, and are too big [a segment of the population], to safely ignore.

Even before being asked the question on Wednesday night, Clinton was accused of pandering, even by some Latino groups she was trying to woo, for sitting down with young undocumented immigrants  known as Dreamers  in Nevada earlier this year and pledging to, if elected president, give them broader protections and push for comprehensive immigration reform.

In large part that is because the year before, she had supported sending back unaccompanied minors who were part of a surge that had appeared at the U.S.-Mexican border asking to stay in the United States.

That remark led to protests and heckling at her speaking events.

Political pandering is such part and parcel of the election process that experts and campaign officials have their own insider terms for it  dog-whistle politics and microtargeting, are two of the more known ones.

The soccer-mom vote was coveted in the 1990s, and NASCAR dads were courted in 2004.

On the one hand, theyre pandering not just to one set of voters, but to polls generally, said D. Sunshine Hillygus, a professor at Duke University who has authored books on political campaigns and elections. Ive always found it surprising that its considered a bad thing to want to represent the views of voters or constituents.

Designing a message for a certain group, Hillygus said, is not necessarily a superficial gesture.

Although it sometimes appears [politicians] are not sincere if it looks like theyre catering to the needs and desires of a particular group, Hillygus said, a candidate can be representing their principles and views, as opposed to behaving in a [purely] strategic fashion.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,How to answer your body's food cravings,[],"Food cravings arent just a silly thing pregnant women deal with for 40 weeks, we all feel the urge to eat foods that may not serve our health and weight goals.

While some cravings are the results of gut bacterial overgrowth, many are really an SOS message of malnutrition from your body.

Most of our food is grown in depleted, over-farmed soil, which lacks the minerals and nutrients it once contained before large scale agriculture. In a 2013 update of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (2010), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that our average intake of important nutrients like potassium, calcium, and magnesium is so low, that it declared the issue a widespread public health issue.

Yet, we eat more food and calories than ever before, and also have an obesity epidemic that grows steadily each year. What gives?

Most of our calories come from refined carbohydrates in the form of sweetened processed foods, which are mostly devoid of essential minerals and nutrients. So we end up craving the vitamins and minerals that our body is lacking. Your body may be craving exactly what it needs.

Magnesium is needed for blood glucose control, muscle and nerve function, and blood pressure regulation. Chromium is necessary for controlling blood sugar, and turning food into energy. Calcium is needed to keep our blood acidity in check, as well as keeping bones and teeth strong.

The chocolate that your conscious mind craves is really a brilliant answer to the magnesium you didnt know you were lacking. And your body and brain know that to quench the nutritional based craving for the important mineral it needs is most easily, happily, and deliciously met by chocolate. (Of course, it also gets a nice hit of caffeine-like theobromine, sugar and fat, which it also likes very much, but probably doesnt need.)

So your body may be craving foods that get you a quick fix of these minerals. It likes to ask for the easiest foods that also give a hit of energy and sugar, too, so sometimes your cravings for magnesium are interpreted as chocolate...like, NOW.""

When my clients begin to see their nutritional cravings for what they are -- messages from the body to boost their micronutrient intake -- they feel the pressure and shame around their cravings totally relax, and begin to feel more in tune with -- and trusting of -- their amazing bodies.

Here are three of the top nutritional cravings you may experience, with easy options of healthy foods to answer your bodys real needs:

Chocolate = magnesium = hemp seeds, chia seeds, kelp

Oily Fatty Snacks = calcium = mustard greens, broccoli, sesame

Coffee = sulfur = egg yolks, garlic, onion





In my book, Women, Food & Desire, I go more in-depth into the nutritional, emotional, physical, and bacterial roots of our cravings.

As for our bacterial roots, put simply we are as bacterial as we are human. We couldnt live without them, as these tiny organisms help us digest and absorb nutrients from our food, help create vitamins and hormones, and keep our skin healthy. We dont even know the extent of their impact on our health yet, but one thing is for sure: they need to eat, too.

Some of these bacteria can get a little out of hand, like a bunch of frat boys who move into an apartment and wreck the place when they invite over dozens of their friends to feast on pizza and beer. Those bad guys, including the candida yeasts which result in vaginal yeast infections, have one favorite food that keeps them growing and multiplying: sugar.

Normally those little beasties are kept in check from overgrowing by the other good bacteria. But our modern lives are like a carpet bomb on the inner microbiomes healthy, balanced ecology. Everything from highly refined and sugary diets, constant stress, antibiotic overuse, and hormonal imbalance caused by toxins in our food and even overuse of birth control pills can kill off the good guys, leaving room for the bad guys to take over.

And its the puppet master that pulled your strings straight to the freezer for a dish of ice cream. Those bacteria live mostly in our digestive system, and communicate with our entire body through the nervous system, demanding to be fed, pulling us to crave sugary and starchy foods, as well as dairy with its milk sugar lactose.

Their sugar cravings are often your sugar cravings. Now, not all sugar cravings are caused by bacterial overgrowth, or dysbiosis, and weve all felt the emotionally calming call of a cupcake after a rough day or breakup.

But the dangers of these bacterial imbalances are real. Digestive distress from bloating, gas, diarrhea, constipation, and leaky gut are all warning signs of bacterial disharmony. If these symptoms continue and grow, the puppet master will cause you to eat your way into weight loss resistance, hormonal and thyroid conditions, blood sugar imbalances, skin problems, and mood swings.

And your gut needs to be strong, healthy, and balanced in order for you to be strong and healthy. To heal your gut and support your digestion you need to keep the good bacteria constantly flowing in, with the right foods and supplements, and avoid the foods and stressors that keep the bad bacteria from moving back into town.

Foods that balance gut bacteria:

Naturally fermented foods like raw sauerkraut, kimchee, unpasteurized miso paste, and unpasteurized apple cider vinegar bring a wide variety of natural probiotics (the good bacteria) into your digestive system, many of which may not be found in man-made probiotic supplements.

Well, when it comes to the hypercompetitive real estate market -- especially in luxury properties -- a little pinot grigio and brie probably isn't going to cut it anymore The latest tactic for high-end sellers? Throwing over-the-top open houses where the attendees are pretty, the party is posh, and the sky is the limit.

These upscale parties can run from $5,000 for an intimate catered gathering for 10 high-profile potential buyers to $50,000 for a blowout with 200 guests. Costs are usually covered by the seller or the broker, or both splitting the bill in hopes that it'll pay off big-time. The main idea: sell a lifestyle, not just the listing (and if you invite people to the party of the year, chances are they'll show up).

Check out these six over-the-top open houses that totally worked -- and find out how you can do a more budget-friendly version.

Hot cars and Hollywood views

During the sale of 1201 Laurel Way in Beverly Hills, CA, The Agency (the ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills'"" favorite real estate pros) partnered up with Lamborghini to sell flashy cars and homes, killing two absurdly pricey birds with one stone. In addition to serving up espresso and macarons, the open house unveiled Lamborghini's all-new Veneno -- one of only nine ever made.

""It was showcased in the property's gorgeous glass-cased garage, or 'car museum' as we liked to call it -- the only garage I know of that has stunning city views of all of LA,"" says agent Farrah Aldjufrie, founder of The Agency. The property did sell (though the car wasn't for sale). However, for those who are drooling at the photos, it's back on the market again for a mere $42 million.

Budget-friendly version: ""It's very easy to add elements to your open house that really create a sense of what it would truly be like to live there and live out the lifestyle of that home,"" says Aldjufrie. ""Try adding simple touches such as having music playing that embodies the vibe of the home or playing a movie on the TV that brings life and action into the house."" Avoid the slasher flicks.

Movie star glamour and a million-dollar makeover

When the popular real estate duo of Tom Postilio and Mickey Conlon, stars of HGTV's "" Selling New York,"" were hired as the fourth (and it turned out final) brokers to sell the New York City pied--terre of legendary actress Joan Collins, they realized no ordinary open house would suffice for the relaunch of the listing.

By embracing an opportunity to tap into the seller's star power, Postilio and Conlon spearheaded an extravagant $1 million temporary makeover of the apartment to showcase its old-world movie star glamour, including the support of Steinway & Sons, who provided a fabulous white baby grand for the open house.

""We called in favors all over the place from several designers and vendors,"" say Postilio and Conlon. ""Cocktails and food were provided by our favorite NYC restaurant, and lots of Champagne was served."" The event was well-attended, garnering the attention of the entire brokerage community, as well as that of several previous prospective buyers who came back for a second look. (The property received multiple offers and sold six to eight weeks after the open house at well above its $2.35 million asking price.) The entire process was filmed for ""Selling New York,"" on which Collins made her first-ever reality TV appearance.

Budget-friendly version: ""Sometimes it takes a village to sell a property,"" say Postilio and Conlon. ""So, reach out to your network of local vendors for contributions.Not only is it a great way for them to showcase their services, but it can reinforce the sense of community so many people seek when buying a new home.""

Like Burning Man, minus the camping and most of the drugs

To attract attention for their listing at 2458 N. Beachwood Drive in the Hollywood Hills, real estate agents David Parnes and James Harris, stars of Bravo's "" Million Dollar Listing,"" drew their open house inspiration from the Burning Man music festival. The result was an extravagant party that included an open bar, catering, dancers, DJs, costumes, tarot card readers, body and face painters, human lampshades, and confetti machines.

""We went above and beyond the typical open house or party to create something unforgettable and emphasize the lifestyle one would have living in that kind of home,"" say Parnes and Harris. And it worked, because the place sold soon after for over $2.2 million.

Budget-friendly version: ""For anyone looking to fake a less extravagant variety of this, we would just emphasize thinking outside of the box -- anything that can capture your audience and get them excited,"" says Parnes. ""Instead of hiring professionals, ask friends if they would be willing to help for the night as waitresses and bartenders."" Or perhaps shell out for a pro mixologist for special cocktails like freshly made mojitos or Maker's Mark Manhattans. A few glow sticks might not hurt either.

Did someone say open house crawl?

While Malibu is obviously a hot location, sometimes its remoteness can keep agents and buyers from making the trek to showings. So Eric Lavey, director of the Estates Division for The Agency, decided to solve that problem with luxury transportation on the house, so to speak, thereby delivering people to the front door in style.

""I organized a Champagne caravan taking agents in Beverly Hills in a few fancy, luxury buses from Beverly Hills into Malibu to see five houses ranging in price from $3 [million] to $23 million,"" says Lavey. ""We served Champagne and cupcakes on the buses, and the whole thing took about four hours. Each house we stopped at had something different to offer guests like more drinks, and some even catered lunch."" The event was a huge success, attracted about 30 to 40 agents, and was a topic on Season 2 of ""Million Dollar Listing.""

Budget-friendly version: ""If a luxury coach with Dom P. flowing is out of the budget, then offer a courtesy UberX ride up to the property and give them a Snickers when they get there,"" suggests Lavey.

Sunsets and sushi

Forget a couple of hours, how about a weekend getaway open house? That's what agent Billy Rose, a founding partner of The Agency, decided to do to showcase a newly constructed modern residence on the market in Santa Barbara, CA.

""We teamed up with Luxe Magazine and Barbara Bestor Architecture to showcase two of Bestor's properties, one being the listing we had on the market,"" says Rose.

Lucky invited guests arrived on a Saturday and met at the new Santa Barbara Public Market, where they enjoyed snacks and gift bags from the market's different vendors. Then chartered buses transported the guests to the first Bestor property, Dewey's Surf Shack, and ultimately to the listing they had at 3660 Toro Canyon Park Road. A wine tasting from a nearby vineyard and a hired sushi chef made for the ultimate open house experience. Guests mixed and mingled as they toured the property with Bestor and her team, learning about the place from the architect and taking in the Santa Barbara views and sunset.

Try experimental theater (really!)

At an open house in January for the brand-new $17.5 million penthouse in the One Vandam building -- which lies on the cusp of Greenwich Village and Tribeca -- the scene was like an artsy, avant-garde party. With a full bar, special lighting, a DJ, and random entertainment ranging from a ballerina in a ""Black Swan"" costume, to Martha Graham Company dancers wearing robes and acting as hosts, to a live ""staging"" event by Meredith Bauer Home, the party was not dull.

""Realtors go to open houses constantly, so you need to create spectacle and give them what we call an 'Instagramable moment' ... something that makes people say, 'I went to this open house and there were live models in the shower,'"" says Natasha Estrada, director of events for The Society Group. ""It brings an immersive wonder to their experience and also provides something they can post to social.""

Budget-friendly version: ""If you don't have the budget to hire performers, hit up your creative friends, contact your local art and dance schools, or post a notice on Facebook,"" says Estrada. ""You'll be surprised how many artists want to share their talents."" Or people eager to gawk at them.",[]

Berta Soler told EFE that she and 16 other women from her group and people associated with the Todos Marchamos opposition platform were ""violently"" arrested on Tuesday in Havana as they were attempting to attend the trial of Ladies in White member Jaqueline Heredia.

The majority of those arrested were released later Tuesday afternoon, but Soler was held until nearly midnight at a police station in Alamar, a neighborhood on the outskirts of the Cuban capital.

Soler said she was questioned there by three State Security agents who ""threatened"" her with the aim of getting the group to cancel its regular peaceful Sunday march on March 20, when Obama is due to become the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in Cuba since Calvin Coolidge in 1928.

Also arrested in Havana on Tuesday was former political prisoner Jose Daniel Ferrer, who was trying to attend a gathering of government opponents.

An associate of the dissident told EFE that Ferrer was arrested in Havana about 3 p.m. Tuesday and taken to a police station in the Regla neighborhood, from where he may have been ""deported"" to his hometown, the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba.

The U.S. assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Roberta Jacobson, expressed her concern about reports from Cuba on the arrests of Soler and Ferrer.

""Very concerned by reports that Cuban gov has detained @jdanielferrer & @bertasoler #Cuba #DDHH,"" wrote Jacobson on her official Twitter account.

In a visit to Miami in late February, Soler asked Obama to send a message of ""repudiation of the human rights violations in Cuba before your visit.""

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"As a major migrant route closes, others are ready to open",[],"As the European Union tries to send thousands of migrants back to Turkey and close the heavily traveled Balkans route, concern is mounting that people desperate to find sanctuary or jobs in Europe are already using smugglers to find other pathways.

Albania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania are alternative tracks, government ministers and experts say, and Spain is in contact with Algeria and Morocco to try to stop new routes opening from there.

""We must not let our guard down. We have to be careful,"" Spanish Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz warned Thursday as he arrived for talks with his EU counterparts in Brussels.

More than 130,000 migrants have entered Greece this year, but their path north through the Balkans to places like Germany and Scandinavia is essentially blocked, due to tight border controls.

Serbian officials said Thursday that around 150 people are coming to Serbia each day via a dangerous track through Bulgaria, and there are frequent reports of robberies and severe beatings by locals.

Smugglers are likely to take advantage of the EU's tentative deal with Turkey coupled with the border chokeholds through the Balkans, some experts say.

""This will be a major win for smuggling groups,"" Tuesday Reitano from the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime told The Associated Press. ""The effects are already visible.""

Reitano said groups of 50 or more migrants are already reported to have been smuggled through Albania by local mafia. Clandestine routes are opening again in Hungary, where authorities report that more people are breaching the razor-wire fence on its southern border.

Italy fears many may head west toward Albania, and take to boats to cross the Adriatic Sea.

""So far we have no evidence of any huge flow,"" Italian Interior Minister Angelino Alfano said. He acknowledged that it would be logical to expect movement given developments in the Balkans but that ""this is not a fact today.""

While the routes are tricky to monitor, and movements can change quickly from day to day, the EU's border agency Frontex said its personnel have not spotted big shifts yet.

However, contingency planning is well under way should things change.

""Albania is just one of the possibilities,"" Frontex's deputy executive director, Berndt Korner, said in Belgrade Thursday.

""The same goes also for the western coast of Greece, the same might also go for Montenegro,"" he said. ""(Whether) it goes up to Croatia remains to be seen, but it is definitely one of the possibilities that are under consideration.""

Once the weather improves, people could turn back to the dangerous route across the Mediterranean Sea from Libya to Italy. Thousands have died off the Italian island of Lampedusa in recent years trying to make that crossing.

German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said that Berlin and Rome are in close contact ""to make sure well in advance that we have no repeat of what has been going on along the Balkans route.""

The EU's in-principle deal with Turkey  a legally complex and unclear agreement essentially outsourcing Europe's refugee woes  remains a concern for many.

""This agreement will dramatically reduce the legal entry points into the Union, forcing desperate refugees to look for other routes,"" warned Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the liberal ALDE bloc in the European Parliament. ""We will see again the revival of the Lampedusa route, a new Malta route, a new Albanian route, anew Bulgarian route.""

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,North Korea fires missiles into the sea in response to South Korea sanctions,[],"North Korea responded Thursday to new sanctions from South Korea by firing short-range ballistic missiles into the sea in a show of defiance and vowing to ""liquidate"" all remaining South Korean assets at former cooperative projects in the North.

The moves are the latest in an escalating standoff between the Koreas that began in January when North Korea detonated what it said was an ""H-bomb of justice,"" its fourth nuclear test. Since then, the North has launched a long-range rocket and the South has shut a jointly run factory park, slapped sanctions on the North, and begun large-scale war games with the United States. North Korea responded by threatening nuclear strikes on South Korea and the U.S. mainland.

The missile firing Thursday came a day after North Korean media printed photos of what appeared to be a mock-up of a nuclear warhead.

The North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said in a statement Thursday that North Korea will ""liquidate"" South Korean assets at the closed factory park in the North Korean border town of Kaesong and at a scrapped tourism resort at Diamond Mountain. In a continuation of bellicose rhetoric that has spiked in recent weeks, it said North Korea will also impose ""lethal"" military, political and economic blows on the South Korean government to accelerate its ""pitiable demise.""

South Korea's government called the North Korean statement a ""provocative act"" and warned the North not to damage any South Korean assets.

North Korea didn't say what exactly it would do with the South Korean assets. Observers said it could move the remaining manufacturing equipment at Kaesong to other industrial areas or convert it to military use, and use the South Korean-owned facilities at Diamond Mountain for its own tourism project.

The South Korean assets at Kaesong include buildings, manufacturing equipment and finished products. The assets at the resort are a hotel, a spa, a golf course and a building used for occasional reunions of Korean families separated by war. The assets are worth about $1.2 billion in total, according to Seoul's Unification Ministry.

The North Korean statement called the new South Korean sanctions ""laughable, unsightly,"" and referred to South Korea's female president, Park Geun-hye, as an ""American prostitute,"" the latest in a series of sexist attacks on her.

All of this has ratcheted up hostility on the already anxious Korean Peninsula. But, so far, analysts don't see the possibility of things spinning out of control. Some of the North's rhetoric is intended for a domestic audience to display government strength ahead of a major meeting of the ruling party in May.

The missiles fired by North Korea on Thursday flew about 310 miles before falling into the ocean off the country's east coast, Seoul's Defense Ministry said. They were believed to be Scud-type missiles, ministry spokesman Moon Sang Gyun said.

Such missile firings by the North are not uncommon when animosity rises. North Korea hates the annual military drills staged by Seoul and Washington, calling them preparations for an invasion. The allies say the drills, which this year are described as the biggest ever, are defensive and routine. North Korea warned at the start of the drills Monday of pre-emptive nuclear strikes.

On Wednesday, North Korea printed photos in official media of a purported mock-up of part of a nuclear warhead, with leader Kim Jong Un repeating a claim that his country has developed miniaturized atomic bombs that can be placed on missiles.

Information from secretive, authoritarian North Korea is often impossible to confirm, and the country's state media have a history of photo manipulation. But it was the first time the North has publicly displayed its purported nuclear designs, though it remains unclear whether the country has functioning warheads of that size or is simply trying to develop one.

South Korea's Defense Ministry on Wednesday disputed the North's claim that it possesses miniaturized warheads.

U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on North Korea's nuclear capabilities, saying it was an intelligence matter, but told reporters the U.S. takes the North's rhetoric seriously.

The United States said Wednesday it has dispatched three B-2 stealth bombers capable of launching nuclear as well as conventional weapons to the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. Strategic Command said the bombers will conduct training with the Australian military during their deployment, which amounts to a show of force at a time of mounting tensions with North Korea.

Jamie Gilt, 31, of Jacksonville, told deputies Tuesday that her son shot her in the back with her .45-caliber handgun while he was sitting in the back seat of her pickup truck.

Capt. Joseph Wells of the Putnam County Sheriff's Office told the Florida Times-Union that Gilt could face a misdemeanor charge if investigators determine that she left the gun in a location where the child could get easy access to it.

Investigators have not been able to interview Gilt about the shooting. She is in stable condition at a local hospital. Her son was unharmed and was reunited with family members. The Department of Children and Families will investigate.

The case has drawn national and international attention after a Facebook page apparently belonging to Gilt was discovered by local media. The site, which was taken down late Wednesday, featured several posts supporting gun rights, including one post that read, in part, ""Even my 4 year old gets jacked up to target shoot with the .22""

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"ISIS registration forms list names, contact info for 22,000 jihadists",[],"Tens of thousands of documents, containing 22,000 names, addresses, telephone numbers and family contacts of Islamic State jihadis, have been obtained by Sky News.

Nationals from at least 51 countries, including the U.K., had to give up their most personal information as they joined the terror organisation. Only when the 23 question form was filled in were they inducted into IS.

A lot of the names and their new Islamic State names on the registration forms are well known.

Abdel Bary, a 26-year-old from London joined in 2013 after visiting Libya, Egypt and Turkey. He is designated as a fighter but is better known in the U.K. as a rap artist. His whereabouts are unknown.

Another jihadi named in the documents, now dead after being targeted in a drone strike, is Junaid Hussain, the head of Islamic State's media wing who along with his wife, former punk Sally Jones, plotted attacks in the U.K. Her whereabouts are unknown.

Reyaad Khan from Cardiff, who also entered in 2013, is also among those found among the registration forms. He was well known for appearing in a highly produced Islamic State propaganda video. He was later killed.

But the key breakthrough from the documents is the revealing of the identities of a number of previously unknown jihadis in the U.K., across northern Europe, much of the Middle East and North Africa, as well as in the United States and Canada.

Their whereabouts are crucial to breaking the organisation and preventing further terror attacks.

Many of the men passed through a series of jihadi ""hotspots"" - such as Yemen, Sudan, Tunisia, Libya, Pakistan and Afghanistan - on multiple occasions, but were apparently unchecked, unmonitored and able to both enter Syria to fight and then to return home.

One of the files marked ""Martyrs"" detailed a brigade manned entirely by fighters who wanted to carry out suicide attacks and were trained to do so.

Some of the telephone numbers on the list are still active and it is believed that although many will be family members, a significant number are used by the jihadis themselves.

The files were passed to Sky News on a memory stick stolen from the head of Islamic State's internal security police, an organisation described by insiders as the group's SS. He had been entrusted to protect the organisation's core secrets and he rarely parted with the drive.

The man who stole it was a former Free Syrian Army convert to Islamic State who calls himself Abu Hamed.

Disillusioned with the Islamic State leadership, he says it has now been taken over by former soldiers from the Iraqi Baath party of Saddam Hussein.

He claims the Islamic rules he believed in have totally collapsed inside the organisation, prompting him to quit.

I met him in a secret location in Turkey, and he said IS was giving up on its headquarters in Raqqa and moving into the central deserts of Syria and ultimately Iraq, the group's birthplace.

He also claimed that in reality Islamic State, The Kurdish YPG and the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, are working together against the moderate Syrian opposition.

Asked if the IS files could bring the network down he nodded and said simply: ""God willing"".

From the attacks in Tunisia and the Bataclan massacre in Paris it is clear that IS is refocusing its base of operations abroad and is intent on carrying out high profile attacks in Western countries, something that security chiefs across Europe are warning about right now.

Sky News has informed the authorities about the haul.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,German police believe ISIS files are legitimate,[],"Germany's federal criminal police said Thursday they are in possession of files containing personal data on members of the extremist Islamic State group and believe them to be authentic.

The announcement came after Britain's Sky News reported it had obtained 22,000 Islamic State files on the border with Turkey and Syria, files that detail ISIS fighters' real names, where they were from, telephone numbers, and even names of those who sponsored and recruited the militants.

Though the significance of these files is yet to be gauged, they could be the largest yet treasure trove of documents found on ISIS and the most significant leak on its past and present fighters and operations across the Mideast.

They could also shape the campaign against the extremist group, which emerged from Al Qaeda in Iraq. The cache, exposing its members and their families, could undermine its future ability to recruit and inspire would-be members.

US Army Col. Steve Warren, spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State, said the information could help the coalition fight the Islamic State group by aiding in a crack-down on ISIS's foreign fighter networks.

He said that while he was not able to verify the documents, he hoped that ""if there is a media outlet that has these names and numbers, I hope they publish them."" This would help bring attention to the problem of foreign fighters joining ISIS, and would help law enforcement crack down on the problem, he said.

""This would allow the law enforcement apparatus across the world to become much more engaged and begin to help do what we can to stem this flow of foreign fighters  so we're hopeful that its accurate and if so we certainly plan to do everything we can to help,"" he said.

Sky said the files were passed on to them on a memory stick stolen from the head of Islamic State's internal security police by a former fighter who had grown disillusioned with the group.

Germany's Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper reported it had also obtained ""dozens"" of similar files on the Turkey-Syria border, where it said Islamic State files and videos were widely available from anti-ISIS Kurdish fighters and also members of the Islamic State group itself.

A spokeswoman for Germany's Bundeskriminalamt, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the matter with the media, said her agency is currently evaluating the files. She declined to say where the agency obtained the files, how many documents are involved and how long it has had them.

Sky reported that the documents are a collection of forms filled out by recruits when they were inducted into the Islamic State. The forms have 23 questions and include nationals from at least 51 countries, Sky reported.

Germany's Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told the dpa news agency that the material would give authorities a better chance to track down and prosecute people who had fought with ISIS.

The material also seems to have the potential to help authorities crack recruitment networks in Europe and elsewhere that have been sending fighters to join the Islamic State group, which has seized large swaths of land in Syria and Iraq and declared a self-styled caliphate on the territory under its control.

There are no clear estimates of how many Islamic State fighters there are in Iraq and Syria, but the numbers range between 30,000 and 100,000. A CIA assessment in late 2014 put the number of ISIS fighters at around 31,500.

Button batteries

Button batteries are increasingly common in car remotes and portable LED lights but they can be extremely dangerous to young kids. Toddlers like shiny objects and will ingest them. The danger is they can get stuck in the esophagus. When a coin gets stuck, it often passes on its own. But when a button battery gets stuck, the battery acid can eat through the wall of the esophagus, causing lifelong disability.Dr. David J.

Swimming pools

There are two items I dont keep around: power washers and extension ladders.

People end up with penetrating injuries or lacerations from their intense water stream.   Dr. Seth Podolsky, vice chair of Cleveland Clinic Emergency Medicine Institute

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"After Trump endorsement, NASCAR leader faces the fallout",[],"When Brian France endorsed Donald Trump for president, the chairman and chief executive of NASCAR thought of it as nothing more than a ""routine endorsement.""

He's been dealing with the fallout ever since.

France's decision to personally back the front-runner for the Republican nomination has roiled a sport his family built from the ground up. It's threatened a decade of work to broaden NASCAR's appeal among minorities, upset one of the most powerful teams in the sport and risked a break with the corporate sponsors that are its financial lifeblood.

""I was frankly, very surprised, that my diversity efforts for my whole career would have been called into question, over this, in my view, a routine endorsement,"" France said Wednesday in an interview with The Associated Press.

France acknowledged he's had to have conversations with sponsors since making the endorsement, which came as NASCAR is seeking a new main sponsor for its top series.

""I made a few phone calls and clarified some things,"" he said. ""That kind of goes with the territory.""

France's appearance at a Trump rally the day before last week's Super Tuesday elections fits with the sport's history of occasionally blending politics with the action at the track. France's grandfather, NASCAR founder Bill France Sr., endorsed George Wallace for president. Its all-time winningest driver, Richard Petty, celebrated his 200th victory with President Ronald Reagan and ran for statewide office in North Carolina in the 1990s.

France told the AP on Wednesday he backed Barack Obama in 2008 and actively participated in the campaign, shifting his support to Mitt Romney four years later.

""I supported Obama. I went to his rallies. I parted with my hard-earned money. There was a movement going on, and I was really thrilled with the idea of the first African-American president,"" he said. ""I did the same for Mitt Romney. In both of those cases, I have never agreed with all of their policies.""

But Trump is a candidate unlike any other in recent memory, drawing intense criticism for the racial undertones of his rhetoric and policies. The billionaire has called immigrants from Mexico rapists and drug dealers, has vowed to forcibly deport the 11 million people living in the country illegally and seeks to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the U.S.

Trump has also earned the explicit or implicit backing of a slew of white nationalist leaders, including former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has compared his language to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.

It's into that cauldron that France inserted himself and his sport -- admittedly without knowing all of what Trump has proposed. ""I don't even know all their policies, truthfully,"" France said. He said he likes Trump's ""business approach"" and his status as a Washington outsider. He also cited the electricity around the Trump campaign and a friendship with one of Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr., that dates back nearly two decades.

""I'm not supporting him for all of his views, or his immigration views,"" France said. ""I happen to be very enamored by the excitement he's brought and the voter turnout that it is creating.""

France also is trying to protect his record on diversity. He said NASCAR has spent ""tens of millions of dollars"" on a program aimed at boosting the participation of minorities in the sport. That program includes Japanese-American driver Kyle Larson, who competes in the top-level Sprint Cup, and Darrell Wallace Jr., a driver in the second-tier Xfinity Series who is black and who came up through NASCAR's diversity program.

France's efforts to quell criticism over what he insists was a ""personal and private"" decision have also been complicated by Trump's continued mentioning of how he's received ""NASCAR's endorsement.""

On Monday, at a North Carolina campaign rally not far from Charlotte Motor Speedway and the headquarters of many top NASCAR teams, Trump was ebullient in describing his backing from the sport. ""You know, I just had a visitor backstage. NASCAR endorsed Trump, can you believe that?"" he asked the crowd.

Except it wasn't NASCAR that made the endorsement. It was France.

""We talked to the campaign about the endorsement that I made, versus the sport, and it's hard to get that perfectly right all the time,"" France said.

Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump's campaign, said in a statement that he spoke broadly because the ""endorsement is from the great Brian France, in addition to several NASCAR drivers.""

In a company-wide email sent last week to all his employees, France reiterated that NASCAR has never had a policy prohibiting employees or competitors from participating in politics, but said that could change in the future.

He told the AP on Wednesday he understands that his endorsement can be viewed as one that comes from NASCAR itself.

""I understand that the family is closely linked with NASCAR. ... We've just always, you've seen politicians come to tracks, and it varies, some Democrats, some are Republicans, all have policies we do and don't agree with,"" he said.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Fact Check: Clinton makes eye-popping claims about Sanders,[],"How can it be that Bernie Sanders could stand on the side of vigilantes on the border, against the auto industry bailout, against an immigration overhaul that would have eased the plight of people in the country illegally? Can this be the liberal senator his supporters know and love?

It can be because of the politically perilous way legislation works in Congress, as bill after bill becomes a grab bag of the good and bad  as lawmakers see it. Hillary Clinton took full advantage of that in the latest Democratic debate, pointing out votes by her opponent that are eye-raising on the surface while brushing off complexities that help explain them.

A look at some claims in the debate and how they compare with the facts:

CLINTON: While in the Senate in 2009, she voted for a bill that later provided the money to bail out the auto industry. ""The money that rescued the auto industry was in that bill,"" which she chided Sanders for voting against.

SANDERS: That bill ""was the bailout of the recklessness, irresponsible and illegal behavior of Wall Street.""

THE FACTS: Sanders is correct. The bill passed in October 2008 provided $700 billion to bail out big banks. But some of that money was later used for a $23.4 billion bailout of Chrysler and General Motors. When Clinton voted for the Wall Street package and Sanders voted against it, neither knew money would be shifted to the auto industry. But now she cites the vote as evidence that he stood against Detroit. When an earlier bill came up explicitly to help the auto industry, both voted for it.

___

CLINTON: Sanders ""stood with the Minutemen vigilantes in their ridiculous, absurd efforts to, quote, hunt down immigrants.""

SANDERS: ""No, I do not support vigilantes, and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make.""

THE FACTS: She was right about his vote, perhaps a little over the top in characterizing it. In 2006, as a member of the House running for the Senate, Sanders voted for an obscure and largely symbolic amendment that sought to prohibit Washington from giving information to foreign governments about the activities of a civilian group operating along the border.

At the time, some hard-liners against immigration were concerned that U.S. officials were tipping off the Mexican government about movements of the civilian Minuteman group that was patrolling the border for people crossing illegally.

Sanders said it was an unimportant amendment ""supported by dozens and dozens of members of the House which codified existing legislation."" But it stands as an example of lawmakers backing something they might not like  or might not have given enough thought to  in order to achieve larger goals in a bill. As it was, the amendment did not survive and the issue was mostly forgotten  but not by Clinton.

___

CLINTON: ""I think our best chance was in 2007, when Ted Kennedy led the charge on comprehensive immigration reform. We had Republican support. We had a president willing to sign it. I voted for that bill. Senator Sanders voted against it.""

SANDERS: ""Well, you have guest-worker programs that have been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the important institutions in this country who studies these issues, as guest-worker programs akin to slavery... They were cheated. They were abused. They were humiliated.""

THE FACTS: Clinton is right that Sanders opposed the immigration liberalization, but that doesn't make him an opponent of that goal. As he explained it, the abusive guest-worker program contained in the legislation was so odious that he could not back the broader bill.

What Sanders did not make clear, though, was that his position also reflected concerns of labor unions that the temporary workers would drive down wages and cost Americans jobs. His stance was not all about the plight of the immigrant laborers, as a video played at the debate showed.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,North Korea fires missiles into the sea in response to South Korea sanctions,[],"North Korea responded Thursday to new sanctions from South Korea by firing short-range ballistic missiles into the sea in a show of defiance and vowing to ""liquidate"" all remaining South Korean assets at former cooperative projects in the North.

The moves are the latest in an escalating standoff between the Koreas that began in January when North Korea detonated what it said was an ""H-bomb of justice,"" its fourth nuclear test. Since then, the North has launched a long-range rocket and the South has shut a jointly run factory park, slapped sanctions on the North, and begun large-scale war games with the United States. North Korea responded by threatening nuclear strikes on South Korea and the U.S. mainland.

The missile firing Thursday came a day after North Korean media printed photos of what appeared to be a mock-up of a nuclear warhead.

The North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said in a statement Thursday that North Korea will ""liquidate"" South Korean assets at the closed factory park in the North Korean border town of Kaesong and at a scrapped tourism resort at Diamond Mountain. In a continuation of bellicose rhetoric that has spiked in recent weeks, it said North Korea will also impose ""lethal"" military, political and economic blows on the South Korean government to accelerate its ""pitiable demise.""

South Korea's government called the North Korean statement a ""provocative act"" and warned the North not to damage any South Korean assets.

North Korea didn't say what exactly it would do with the South Korean assets. Observers said it could move the remaining manufacturing equipment at Kaesong to other industrial areas or convert it to military use, and use the South Korean-owned facilities at Diamond Mountain for its own tourism project.

The South Korean assets at Kaesong include buildings, manufacturing equipment and finished products. The assets at the resort are a hotel, a spa, a golf course and a building used for occasional reunions of Korean families separated by war. The assets are worth about $1.2 billion in total, according to Seoul's Unification Ministry.

The North Korean statement called the new South Korean sanctions ""laughable, unsightly,"" and referred to South Korea's female president, Park Geun-hye, as an ""American prostitute,"" the latest in a series of sexist attacks on her.

All of this has ratcheted up hostility on the already anxious Korean Peninsula. But, so far, analysts don't see the possibility of things spinning out of control. Some of the North's rhetoric is intended for a domestic audience to display government strength ahead of a major meeting of the ruling party in May.

The missiles fired by North Korea on Thursday flew about 310 miles before falling into the ocean off the country's east coast, Seoul's Defense Ministry said. They were believed to be Scud-type missiles, ministry spokesman Moon Sang Gyun said.

Such missile firings by the North are not uncommon when animosity rises. North Korea hates the annual military drills staged by Seoul and Washington, calling them preparations for an invasion. The allies say the drills, which this year are described as the biggest ever, are defensive and routine. North Korea warned at the start of the drills Monday of pre-emptive nuclear strikes.

On Wednesday, North Korea printed photos in official media of a purported mock-up of part of a nuclear warhead, with leader Kim Jong Un repeating a claim that his country has developed miniaturized atomic bombs that can be placed on missiles.

Information from secretive, authoritarian North Korea is often impossible to confirm, and the country's state media have a history of photo manipulation. But it was the first time the North has publicly displayed its purported nuclear designs, though it remains unclear whether the country has functioning warheads of that size or is simply trying to develop one.

South Korea's Defense Ministry on Wednesday disputed the North's claim that it possesses miniaturized warheads.

U.S. State Department spokesman John Kirby declined to comment on North Korea's nuclear capabilities, saying it was an intelligence matter, but told reporters the U.S. takes the North's rhetoric seriously.

The United States said Wednesday it has dispatched three B-2 stealth bombers capable of launching nuclear as well as conventional weapons to the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. Strategic Command said the bombers will conduct training with the Australian military during their deployment, which amounts to a show of force at a time of mounting tensions with North Korea.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"After Trump endorsement, NASCAR leader faces the fallout",[],"When Brian France endorsed Donald Trump for president, the chairman and chief executive of NASCAR thought of it as nothing more than a ""routine endorsement.""

He's been dealing with the fallout ever since.

France's decision to personally back the front-runner for the Republican nomination has roiled a sport his family built from the ground up. It's threatened a decade of work to broaden NASCAR's appeal among minorities, upset one of the most powerful teams in the sport and risked a break with the corporate sponsors that are its financial lifeblood.

""I was frankly, very surprised, that my diversity efforts for my whole career would have been called into question, over this, in my view, a routine endorsement,"" France said Wednesday in an interview with The Associated Press.

France acknowledged he's had to have conversations with sponsors since making the endorsement, which came as NASCAR is seeking a new main sponsor for its top series.

""I made a few phone calls and clarified some things,"" he said. ""That kind of goes with the territory.""

France's appearance at a Trump rally the day before last week's Super Tuesday elections fits with the sport's history of occasionally blending politics with the action at the track. France's grandfather, NASCAR founder Bill France Sr., endorsed George Wallace for president. Its all-time winningest driver, Richard Petty, celebrated his 200th victory with President Ronald Reagan and ran for statewide office in North Carolina in the 1990s.

France told the AP on Wednesday he backed Barack Obama in 2008 and actively participated in the campaign, shifting his support to Mitt Romney four years later.

""I supported Obama. I went to his rallies. I parted with my hard-earned money. There was a movement going on, and I was really thrilled with the idea of the first African-American president,"" he said. ""I did the same for Mitt Romney. In both of those cases, I have never agreed with all of their policies.""

But Trump is a candidate unlike any other in recent memory, drawing intense criticism for the racial undertones of his rhetoric and policies. The billionaire has called immigrants from Mexico rapists and drug dealers, has vowed to forcibly deport the 11 million people living in the country illegally and seeks to temporarily bar Muslims from entering the U.S.

Trump has also earned the explicit or implicit backing of a slew of white nationalist leaders, including former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has compared his language to that of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.

It's into that cauldron that France inserted himself and his sport -- admittedly without knowing all of what Trump has proposed. ""I don't even know all their policies, truthfully,"" France said. He said he likes Trump's ""business approach"" and his status as a Washington outsider. He also cited the electricity around the Trump campaign and a friendship with one of Trump's sons, Donald Trump Jr., that dates back nearly two decades.

""I'm not supporting him for all of his views, or his immigration views,"" France said. ""I happen to be very enamored by the excitement he's brought and the voter turnout that it is creating.""

France also is trying to protect his record on diversity. He said NASCAR has spent ""tens of millions of dollars"" on a program aimed at boosting the participation of minorities in the sport. That program includes Japanese-American driver Kyle Larson, who competes in the top-level Sprint Cup, and Darrell Wallace Jr., a driver in the second-tier Xfinity Series who is black and who came up through NASCAR's diversity program.

France's efforts to quell criticism over what he insists was a ""personal and private"" decision have also been complicated by Trump's continued mentioning of how he's received ""NASCAR's endorsement.""

On Monday, at a North Carolina campaign rally not far from Charlotte Motor Speedway and the headquarters of many top NASCAR teams, Trump was ebullient in describing his backing from the sport. ""You know, I just had a visitor backstage. NASCAR endorsed Trump, can you believe that?"" he asked the crowd.

Except it wasn't NASCAR that made the endorsement. It was France.

""We talked to the campaign about the endorsement that I made, versus the sport, and it's hard to get that perfectly right all the time,"" France said.

Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Trump's campaign, said in a statement that he spoke broadly because the ""endorsement is from the great Brian France, in addition to several NASCAR drivers.""

In a company-wide email sent last week to all his employees, France reiterated that NASCAR has never had a policy prohibiting employees or competitors from participating in politics, but said that could change in the future.

He told the AP on Wednesday he understands that his endorsement can be viewed as one that comes from NASCAR itself.

""I understand that the family is closely linked with NASCAR. ... We've just always, you've seen politicians come to tracks, and it varies, some Democrats, some are Republicans, all have policies we do and don't agree with,"" he said.",[]

Bernie Sanders staked their ground Wednesday night in Florida as both vowing not to deport children and illegal immigrants with a clean criminal record.

Their comments set up a showdown with Republican candidates Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who both have vowed to clamp down on illegal immigrants in the country.

Trump and Cruz, along with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich will get their opportunity to address the thorny topic Thursday when they debate in the Sunshine State.

Clinton and Sanders squared off in their eighth debate Wednesday night held at Miami Dade College in Florida. The Univision/CNN debate is the final one scheduled this month between the candidates in the running for the 2016 Democratic nomination.

During the debate, both Clinton and Sanders vowed to push for immigration reform if elected president.

The essence of what we are trying to do is to unite families, not to divide families, Sanders said.

Clinton says she will extend President Obamas executive orders shielding some illegal immigrants from deportation.

Clinton called the New York businessman un-American and said he traffics in prejudice and paranoia.

You dont make America great again by getting rid of everything that made America great, Clinton said, referencing Trumps campaign slogan.

Sanders said voters would never elect a candidate like Trump.

Clinton also slammed Trumps plan to build a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.

As I understand, hes talking about a tall wall. A beautiful, tall wall, Clinton said, adding that Trumps plan to keep out immigrants and his claim hell get Mexico to pay for it is a fantasy.

Clinton then turned her sights on Sanders, accusing him of supporting legislation that would have led to indefinite detention of people facing deportation, and for standing with Minutemen vigilantes.

Sanders refuted the notion, which he called ""ridiculous"" and ""absurd,"" and accused Clinton of picking small pieces out of big legislative packages to distort his voting record.

""No, I do not support vigilantes and that is a horrific statement and an unfair statement to make,"" he said, adding: ""I will match my record against yours any day of the week.""

Clinton also dodged early debate questions about ongoing investigations into her use of a private email server when she was secretary of state. When debate moderator Jorge Ramos of Univision asked her if she would drop out of the race if indicted over the handling of her email while secretary of state she replied,""Oh for goodness sake, that is not going to happen. I'm not even answering that question.""

The FBI is investigation the possibility of mishandling of sensitive information that passed through Clinton's private email server.

Sanders, as he has in the past, declined to bite on the issue, saying, ""The process will take its course."" He said he'd rather talk about the issues of wealth and income inequality.

Clinton also defended her role in the deadly 2012 attack on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya.

She said Wednesday that her shifting explanations for the crisis in the early hours were because of changing dynamics and new information.

Clinton also said the investigation has been politicized by Republicans seeking to score points against her campaign.

""This was fog of war,"" she said, saying that she regrets the lives lost in the crisis.

She added: ""I wish there could be an easy answer at the time but we learned a lot.""

Sanders came into Wednesday nights debate after a surprise primary win in Michigan Tuesday, where he had been trailing by more than 20 points in the polls.

Clinton vowed to keep fighting Wednesday, saying, It was a very close race. Ive won some and Ive lost some.

Sanders campaign officials made the case Tuesday night that the Vermont senators attacks on Clintons support for free trade deals had an impact in the Michigan race, and likely will be effective in upcoming contests in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri.

The Sanders camp maintains Clintons advantage in the South will go away after next Tuesday, as rural voters in other states take a closer look at their candidate.

Clinton, though she maintains a healthy lead overall, needs Floridas 99 delegates up for grabs March 15 to help clinch the nomination.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Trump Could Win Over Some Black Voters,[],"By Joseph Weber, Fox News

Contest after contest has shown Hillary Clinton has the overwhelming support of black voters in the 2016 Democratic primary  but up against Donald Trump, the general election might be a different story.

To be sure, nobody expects Trump or any GOP presidential candidate to win the majority of the black vote, which has been with Democrats since the mid-1930s. Clinton has every reason to believe most black voters sticking with her in the primary against Bernie Sanders would do so in a general election as well.

However, analysts suggest that to consider the black vote a monolith for Clinton in November, should she win the nomination, would be a mistake. The Trump jobs message that has attracted so many disaffected white, blue-collar workers could resonate with black voters equally frustrated by chronic unemployment and unfulfilled promises of change  and Trumps accelerating march toward the GOP nomination has proven his knack for bringing in voters who might not normally pick a Republican.

If anything, he knows the economy, Luz Nelson, a beautician and black South Carolina voter, said days before the front-running Clinton won the state Democratic primary with more than 80 percent of the black vote.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Good match not always needed for living donor kidney transplant,[],"Transplanting a mismatched kidney from a living donor may lower the risk of death more than not doing a transplant at all, according to a new study that could open the door to more operations.

A long-term study found that transplant recipients whose immune systems were technically incompatible to the donated kidney - because they had so-called anti-HLA antibodies - were more likely to be alive eight years later than people who did not receive a transplant or waited to get an organ from a deceased donor.

""We used to say if you had a compatible donor, you could do a transplant. Now you can say, if you have an incompatible donor, we still can make that transplant happen,"" senior author Dr. Dorry Segev of John Hopkins University in Baltimore told Reuters Health. ""That's very exciting to those on the waiting list.""

Eight-year survival rates were almost 77 percent for 1,025 people who received an HLA-incompatible kidney from a live donor, 63 percent for 5,125 matched patients who remained on a waiting list for a kidney or received a kidney from a deceased donor and 44 percent for 5,125 people who remained on the waiting list without receiving a kidney.

""The paper is showing how much longer the patient will live compared to their next available option,"" said Segev, who directs John Hopkins' Epidemiology Research Group in Organ Transplantation. ""Your next best option is waiting on the list for a compatible donor, and a lot of those patients will never find one.""

The study was done at 22 centers. It could help the more than 32,000 people in the United States who have anti-HLA antibodies and need a transplant.

""It's all about timing,"" said Dr. Sanjay Kulkarni, director of kidney and pancreas transplantation at Yale-New Haven Hospital and the Yale School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. ""The longer people are on dialysis before they have a transplant, the worse their survival,"" he said.

""So if you have a living donor, instead of waiting five years for a compatible donor, if you can get a transplant from an incompatible donor in a couple of months, this paper suggests that that is beneficial, despite the fact that they have a higher rate of rejection,"" he told Reuters Health.

""The implications of these results are revolutionary, especially when the numerous contradictory opinions raised by the transplant community are considered,"" said Drs. Lionel Rostaing and Paolo Malvezzi of the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Grenoble Alpes in La Tronche, France, in an editorial accompanying the study in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Desensitizing recipients can be very expensive, they said, and the immunosuppressive regimens required carry the potential of infection and cancer. In addition, living donors face a small but significant increase in their risk of end stage renal disease.

Nonetheless, Rostaing and Malvezzi write, using incompatible kidneys from living donors ""may save lives and may be cost-effective over time.""

There is an added cost, but it is relatively small, Segev said.

Each patient's immune system has to be desensitized to accept the incompatible kidney. Depending on antibody levels, ""it can take a few days to a couple of weeks,"" he said. ""But compared to the cost of a transplant, it's relatively low. If a transplant costs perhaps $100,000 and you add desensitization, it might be $110,000 to $120,000.""

There's the additional cost of $10,000 or so each year for drugs to keep the immune system from rejecting the kidney. ""But compared to $100,000 a year f dialysis,"" he said, a transplant quickly becomes cost effective over time.

Kulkarni cautioned that the organ donation system was changed just over two years ago to make it easier for hard-to-match patients to get a kidney from a deceased donor.

Now ""people are getting transplanted much quicker"" so today's survival rates may not be as dramatically different as they are in the new study, he said. ""But I bet they still hold.""",[]

Security Council resolution.

According to ministry spokesman, Hossein Jaberi Ansari, the missiles were ""conventional defensive instruments and they were merely for legitimate defense,"" the official IRNA news agency reported.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard test-launched two ballistic missiles on Wednesday emblazoned with the phrase ""Israel must be wiped out"" in Hebrew  a show of power by the Shiite nation, long an opponent of Israel.

It was the latest in a series of recent tests, aimed at demonstrating Iran's intentions to push ahead with its ballistic program after scaling backing its nuclear program under the deal reached last year with the U.S. and other world powers.

Israel's Foreign Ministry condemned the launch, saying it did violate the U.N. resolution and that it shows that Iran ""continues to dismiss the international community's demands and to develop its aggressive capabilities."" In a statement Thursday, the ministry called on the world to ""react firmly and decisively"" against further Iranian missile launches.

However, Ansari said the test-firing ""did not defy the Security Council resolution"" and added that Iran will continue its missile program. He also said Iran will remain committed to its international obligations.

""The Islamic Republic of Iran will not compromise over its security and defensive power,"" said Ansari.

""It will continue it's completely defensive and legitimate missile program while observing its international commitments and without entering into the fields of either nuclear warheads or designing missiles capable of carrying such warheads,"" he added.

The landmark nuclear deal, under which Iran accepted to substantially cap its nuclear program, does not include provisions against missile launches. When it came into effect on Jan. 16, the Security Council lifted most U.N. sanctions against Tehran  including a ban it had imposed in 2010 on Iran testing missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.

That ban likely would have covered some of the missile fired this week. To deal with the restrictions in the nuclear agreement, the U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution last July which among other measures ""calls on"" Iran not to carry out such tests.

Late Wednesday, the head of the airspace division of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard, Gen. Amir Ali Hejazi, told state TV that the Hebrew markings on the missiles tested earlier in the day were ""a choice by colleagues"" who worked on the missiles, indicating it was not an official, high-level decision.

What if these defenses do not hold up to even cursory examination?

What if the other secretaries of state to whom she refers are Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice? What if neither of them diverted all of their emails to a private server?

What if that tutorial reminds the people to whom secrets are being reposed that it is their legal obligation to recognize and accept and understand the law before they can receive any state secrets? What if, in order to confirm that understanding, all people who receive the tutorial are required to sign an oath at the end of the tutorial recognizing, accepting and understanding the law and agreeing to be bound by it? What if Clinton signed just such an oath?

What if Clinton had no intention of complying with the oath she signed at the time she signed it? What if we know that because we know she hired the information technologist to divert her emails the same week she received the FBI tutorial? What if she never told the FBI that she planned to divert all her emails -- including those that would contain state secrets -- to a private non-secure email server in her home?

What if it is the law of the land that the failure to secure state secrets is a felony, known as espionage? What if it is the law of the land that espionage can be committed by a person who intends to expose state secrets or by a person who doesnt care if she exposes state secrets? What if the FBI explained to Clinton in her first day as secretary of state that the grossly negligent exposure of state secrets constitutes espionage?

What if before Clinton was secretary of state, she was a U.S. senator from New York for eight years? What if during that time, she was a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee? What if during her time in the Senate, she was exposed to hundreds of military-related state secrets?

What if Clinton is smart enough and shrewd enough and experienced enough to recognize a state secret when she sees one?

What if the FBI has seen emails in which Clinton ordered subordinates deliberately to avoid State Department secure channels of communications and to send state secrets to her through channels she knew were not secure? What if Clinton passed on state secrets to others who had no security clearances? What if she did so knowing she was sending state secrets from her non-secure server to other non-secure servers?

What if Clinton sent or received more than 2,000 emails that contained state secrets? What if she authored more than 100 of them herself? What if some of the 2,000 emails were so secret that the FBI agents investigating her lack the security clearances to view those emails?

What if Clinton did all this so that she could keep her behavior as secretary of state secret and away from all officials in the State Department outside her inner circle, away from the president and away from the American people? What if she orchestrated and carried out a conspiracy to violate the Espionage Act?

What if the FBI is onto her? What if the Democrats are not?

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Trump train still rolling as detractors desperately try to slow him down,['Howard Kurtz'],"What does it take to stop this guy?

That has got to be the lament within the wreckage of the Republican establishment after Donald Trump won Michigan, Mississippi and Hawaii after enduring nearly two weeks of political carpet-bombing.

There was criticism by everyone from Romney to Ryan, harsh rhetoric from his rivals and Super PAC attack ads, along with comparisons to Nixon and David Duke from the #NeverTrump wing of the media. And yet Trump still rolled to victory in three of the four states voting Tuesday.

Ted Cruz managed to win the Idaho caucuses, Marco Rubio had another terrible night as he ponders a last stand in Florida, and John Kasich had a respectable finish in Michigan that he hopes to parlay into a win in Ohio.

But politicians winning their home states is a pittance compared to what Trump, against all odds, is managing to pull off. To carry his first industrial Midwest state, while also winning easily in a Deep South state, shows the breadth of his appeal.

The media chatter heading into Tuesday was all about whether Trump had peaked. The attacks were changing the tone of the campaign, the national polls were tightening, and he lost two out of four states to Cruz over the weekend (both caucus states, where the senators superior organization gives him an edge).

More pundits started writing about how Trump would fall short of the required 1,237 delegates and how the party could snatch away the nomination in Cleveland.

So why did Trump do so well?

As he noted at his news conference, advertising has never mattered less than in this campaign cycle. Jeb Bushs PAC spent $100 million and he went nowhere. People are tired of negative ads, viewing them as politics as usual. (Trump airs them as well, but doesnt spend much of his fortune doing so.)

Trumps critics believe that if there could just be more exposes, more digging, more focus on his past liberal views or current shifting of positions, his candidacy would collapse of its own weight.

But Trumps appeal is not tied to policy specifics. Its the image of strength he projects, the force of his personality and the notion that his business success shows he can shake up Washington.

Of course he benefits from enormous media attention, but look at how he does it. The three cable news networks carried his 45-minute presser, blowing off Hillarys speech, because it was anything but a canned political address. He took reporters questions, parried criticism of his companies, talked up his vodka and steaksit was a show. And yesterday he did a round of morning shows, taking still more questions and getting into a tiff with George Stephanopoulos over why the ABC anchor focused on the negative by bringing up late deciders who seemed to break against him.

Maybe there is some kryptonite that can weaken this guy. But as he runs roughshod over the Republican Party, no one has been able to find it.

(AP Photo/Eraldo Peres)

State prosecutors have filed charges against former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in a money laundering investigation, putting further scrutiny on one of Brazil's towering political figures who is being hounded by corruption allegations.

The charges brought by prosecutors in Sao Paulo state arise from allegations that he hid his ownership of a seafront penthouse in the city of Guaruja.

Silva denies that he secretly owns the apartment, which belongs to construction company OAS. OAS is one of the main targets of a parallel federal corruption investigation that focuses on state-run oil giant Petrobras. Last week, Silva was held for questioning and his home raided in that probe.

The charges filed Wednesday against Silva still need to be accepted by a judge. In a statement, Brazil's once-immensely popular ex-president said that the Sao Paulo state investigators ""are not unbiased"" and have no authority to conduct the investigation.

""There is no news in the charges by Sao Paulo's Attorney General's Office, since they were announced in the magazine Veja on January 22 of 2016,"" Silva said in a statement.

The investigators have scheduled a press conference for Thursday.

Last Friday, federal investigators said they were looking into whether renovations at the Guaruja beachfront apartment and another project at a country house used by Silva and his family constituted favors in exchange for political benefit.

Both places have undergone major renovations paid for by construction companies that for decades have had contracts with the federal government. The companies are also at the center of the $2 billion Petrobras scandal.

Silva admits to having visited the penthouse twice, but says he never owned the apartment. He claims the country house belongs to friends who let him and his family use it.

Federal investigators are also trying to determine if Silva sold his influence in the current administration in exchange for speeches and donations to his nonprofit foundation Instituto Lula.

Jair Jaloreto, a Sao Paulo-based expert on money laundering, said the penthouse case that motivated Wednesday's charges is ""very confusing indeed.""

""I see more risk for Lula (Silva) in the investigations into the country house. If he didn't deliver the speeches he was paid for, that could also be money laundering. But this apartment case is difficult. He never used it, there is no document saying it was his. It will be tough for the investigators to prove,"" he said.

Silva governed from 2003 to 2010. Despite a votes-for-bribes scandal that took down his chief-of-staff and others, he left office with record high popularity levels and his hand-picked successor, current President Dilma Rousseff, handily won the presidency.

Silva and Rousseff have seen their popularity nosedive as Brazil has slipped into its worst recession in decades and the investigations have spread. Rousseff's approval ratings have dipped into single digits, though they've rebounded slightly of late. She faces impeachment proceedings.

Nationals from at least 51 countries, including the U.K., had to give up their most personal information as they joined the terror organisation. Only when the 23 question form was filled in were they inducted into IS.

A lot of the names and their new Islamic State names on the registration forms are well known.

Abdel Bary, a 26-year-old from London joined in 2013 after visiting Libya, Egypt and Turkey. He is designated as a fighter but is better known in the U.K. as a rap artist. His whereabouts are unknown.

Another jihadi named in the documents, now dead after being targeted in a drone strike, is Junaid Hussain, the head of Islamic State's media wing who along with his wife, former punk Sally Jones, plotted attacks in the U.K. Her whereabouts are unknown.

Reyaad Khan from Cardiff, who also entered in 2013, is also among those found among the registration forms. He was well known for appearing in a highly produced Islamic State propaganda video. He was later killed.

But the key breakthrough from the documents is the revealing of the identities of a number of previously unknown jihadis in the U.K., across northern Europe, much of the Middle East and North Africa, as well as in the United States and Canada.

Their whereabouts are crucial to breaking the organisation and preventing further terror attacks.

Many of the men passed through a series of jihadi ""hotspots"" - such as Yemen, Sudan, Tunisia, Libya, Pakistan and Afghanistan - on multiple occasions, but were apparently unchecked, unmonitored and able to both enter Syria to fight and then to return home.

One of the files marked ""Martyrs"" detailed a brigade manned entirely by fighters who wanted to carry out suicide attacks and were trained to do so.

Some of the telephone numbers on the list are still active and it is believed that although many will be family members, a significant number are used by the jihadis themselves.

The files were passed to Sky News on a memory stick stolen from the head of Islamic State's internal security police, an organisation described by insiders as the group's SS. He had been entrusted to protect the organisation's core secrets and he rarely parted with the drive.

The man who stole it was a former Free Syrian Army convert to Islamic State who calls himself Abu Hamed.

Disillusioned with the Islamic State leadership, he says it has now been taken over by former soldiers from the Iraqi Baath party of Saddam Hussein.

He claims the Islamic rules he believed in have totally collapsed inside the organisation, prompting him to quit.

I met him in a secret location in Turkey, and he said IS was giving up on its headquarters in Raqqa and moving into the central deserts of Syria and ultimately Iraq, the group's birthplace.

He also claimed that in reality Islamic State, The Kurdish YPG and the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, are working together against the moderate Syrian opposition.

Asked if the IS files could bring the network down he nodded and said simply: ""God willing"".

From the attacks in Tunisia and the Bataclan massacre in Paris it is clear that IS is refocusing its base of operations abroad and is intent on carrying out high profile attacks in Western countries, something that security chiefs across Europe are warning about right now.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Monkeys move wheelchairs using just their thoughts,[],"Monkeys equipped with wireless brain implants were able to control robotic wheelchairs using only their thoughts, according to a new study.

The brain waves of two rhesus macaques were used to direct motor commands on a motorized wheelchair. The monkeys were initially trained to navigate the wheelchair by simply watching it move, the researchers said. The new findings could one day improve the mobility of the most severely disabled people, such as those with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), who cannot even move a cheek or eye muscle, the scientists added.

""In some severely disabled people, even blinking is not possible,"" Dr. Miguel Nicolelis, co-director of the Duke Center for Neuroengineering, said in a statement. ""For them, using a wheelchair or device controlled by noninvasive measures like an EEG [electroencephalogram]  a device that monitors brain waves through electrodes on the scalp  may not be sufficient. We show clearly that if you have intracranial implants, you get better control of a wheelchair than with noninvasive devices."" [See video of a monkey moving a wheelchair with its brain]

Brain machine interface

The new experiment isn't the first time that scientists have created a so-called brain-machine interface. In a 2009 study, researchers showed that people with electrodes implanted in their brains could type with just their thoughts. In 2012, a quadriplegic used thoughts to move a robotic arm. And in 2013, Nicolelis and his colleagues showed that monkeys could move robotic arms with their minds.

To expand upon their earlier work, Nicolelis and his colleagues implanted hundreds of tiny electrodes into the premotor cortex, which helps plan movement, and the somatosensory cortex, which helps process the sense of touch, of two monkeys. They then trained the monkeys to use their brain waves to navigate the wheelchair toward a bowl of tasty grapes. Nicolelis and his colleagues then recorded their brain waves from 300 brain cells, or neurons, during this process. The scientists translated those brain waves into commands for a motorized wheelchair. [Image Gallery: The Incredible Bionic Man]

Over time, the monkeys got better at the task, navigating towards the bowl of grapes more quickly and with fewer wrong turns, the researchers reported online March 3 in the journal Scientific Reports.

The team found that the monkeys were not only producing brain signals associated with translation and rotation, but they were also evaluating the distance between the bowl of fruit and the chair.

""This was not a signal that was present in the beginning of the training, but something that emerged as an effect of the monkeys becoming proficient in this task,"" Nicolelis said in a statement. ""This was a surprise. It demonstrates the brain's enormous flexibility to assimilate a device, in this case a wheelchair, and that device's spatial relationships to the surrounding world.""

In follow-up work, Nicolelis and his colleagues want to expand their neuronal recording to a greater number of brain regions, in order to improve the brain-computer interface.

Judge John Hlophe in Cape Town convicted the woman of kidnapping, fraud and contravening child protection laws, said Eric Ntabazalila, spokesman for the National Prosecuting Authority. The judge revoked bail and the woman will be detained until her May 30 sentencing, he said.

Your story if anything is a fairy tale and the court rejects it with the contempt it deserves, Hlophe told the grim-faced woman, according to Sky News. He ordered that neither the defendant nor the girl may be identified.

Hlophe mentioned in court that the woman could be looking at a 10-year prison sentence.

The girl's biological mother, Celeste Nurse, sobbed loudly as the verdict was delivered amid chants of Yes! Yes! from the public gallery inside the courtroom, Sky News reported.

State prosecutors said the woman snatched the three-day-old baby from her sleeping mother's hospital bedside in Cape Town in April 1997. The prosecution also said the woman defrauded authorities when she registered the child as her own daughter in 2003, also changing her birthdate.

The defendant, now 51, pleaded not guilty to all three charges. During the trial she testified that she adopted the child.

""I didn't know the baby was stolen,"" the woman testified, according to the African News Agency.

The woman had told the court in earlier proceedings that she had adopted the baby after struggling with infertility. She said she was not aware the child was kidnapped. The woman who facilitated the adoption told her a young woman had given the child up, she said.

The girl reportedly was reunited with her biological parents, Morne and Celeste Nurse, last year after their second daughter befriended a girl at school who looked remarkably like her. After a police investigation and DNA tests, that new friend turned out to be the Nurses' missing child.

The biological parents sobbed as the judge read the verdict, ANA reported, capping off an emotional trial.

Morne Nurse, the girl's biological father, told the court in February that he was crying my heart out in the fetal position on the day the baby disappeared.

The girl, now 18, was not in court and is taking high school final exams.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Why Republican voters are in revolt over corporate crony trade deals,['Richard Manning'],"The Michigan primary results on Tuesday signal a quantum shift in GOP voter attitudes on free trade policies that have served corporate crony agendas leaving the American people behind.

Thats not just analysis, it is fact based upon a just released Americans for Limited Government survey conducted by independent pollster Patrick Caddell. The stunning results of the Caddell study showed that GOP voters reject the global trade agenda at an even higher rate than Democrat voters, throwing conventional wisdom on its ear.

The ramifications for President Obamas ill-conceived Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) could not be more ominous. When asked in an informed question about whether the TPP should be passed in a lame duck Congress, Republican voters oppose it by a 66 to 15 margin, far outstripping Democrat or Independent opposition.

This represents a quantum shift in anticipated political party attitudes on an issue where Republican members of Congress could be counted upon to salute in almost lock-step in favor of any legislation labeled free trade.

The conversion point for Republican voters comes from a strong sense that the system is rigged against them in favor of the corporate cronies who manipulate the law to benefit themselves at the expense of everyone else.

Caddell found that GOP voters view the results of the free trade agreements over the past two decades serve as the primary indictment against any new agreement with a 59 percent saying that previous deals were more of a benefit to other countries, and a startlingly low 4 percent agreeing that free trade deals have been more of a benefit to the U.S. and only 14 percent who said they were equally beneficial to all.

The economic facts over the past two decades bear out GOP voters dismissal of the notion that trade deals help the United States. The year 2000 was the last year that the U.S. economy grew at 4 percent or above, and not coincidentally, the same year the U.S. granted China permanent normal trade relations.

What makes the current skepticism even more acute is the fact that the U.S. economy has not even grown at a 3 percent level since 2005, and the past ten years have had the worst level of GDP growth since the Great Depression as labor participation among working age adults has collapsed.

When asked in an informed question about whether Congress should pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership in a lame duck session as has been proposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, GOP voters answer with a resounding no, opposing passage of the deal by a 66 to 15 percent margin.

Republican power brokers, consultants and elites have been confounded by the utter rejection of every presidential candidate who has chosen to take on their mantle in this election season with Marco Rubios last place finishes in both Michigan and Mississippi providing the latest evidence. Caddell finds that GOP voters flat out dont trust their leaders to look out for the national or their own individual interests with 85 percent agreeing with the statement that, political leaders are more interested in protecting their power and privilege than doing what is right for the American people.

This stark wake-up call for GOP leadership is devastating, but it is survivable if they are willing to take stands that demonstrate that they are fighting to restore America.

In this regard, the GOP Senates decision to stand firm against allowing President Obama to fundamentally change the make-up of the Supreme Court rather than relying upon a vote of the people to make that decision is a great first step.

Every Republican candidate for President and Congress, should forcefully reject the notion of passing Obamas Trans-Pacific Partnership with a particular disdain for bringing it up in a lame duck when many of their colleagues will be looking for their next jobs rather than looking out for the interests of the American people.

By rejecting the status quo trade agenda of the D.C. elites, Congress will show the independence that their political base is looking for, reconnecting by taking a stand against those who are pulling the strings with no regard for the plight of Americans or America itself.

It is no secret that Republican voters are in outright revolt, they are tired of their prosperity being traded away and their childrens futures being diminished as our nations wealth gets transferred around the world to benefit corporate cronies with the pull to gain favor, and nations that dont like us very much.

They have caught on to the big lie that these trade agreements benefit them or America, and now it is time for GOP leaders to follow them and reject the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the latest in a long line of bad trade deals.

In that race, he ignored calls to step aside and allow Crist to ascend. He won by capturing a diverse constituency of voters made up of his base in Miami-Dade County, Tea Party conservatives in the northern part of Florida, and a wave of new Hispanic voters in the states highly coveted Interstate 4 corridor.

Six years later, Rubio finds himself in a similar predicament. Only this time, the stakes are much higher and his chances of pulling another upset are even slimmer. Following another poor showing against Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho and Hawaii, the one-term senators presidential campaign is on life support as Rubio makes what could be his final stand in his home state of Florida.

We need to work day and night in Florida, says Bertica Cabrera Morris, an Orlando political strategist who is in charge of Rubios I-4 campaign. Now is the time to put all our hands on deck.

Yet, some political observers say it could be too late for Rubio to mount a surprise comeback in the contest for the Republican presidential nomination, which has been usurped by Trump, who leads the Senator by 7 to 20 points in Florida, according to several polls. Even a great performance in tonights Republican debate at the University of Miami may not be enough to snatch Floridas 99 delegates.

I think Trump has changed the landscape, said Nelson Diaz, chairman of the Miami-Dade Republican Party. Before, Marco ran against a governor who was highly unpopular with the partys rank-and-file. People knew Crist wasnt a real Republican.

Sylvia Manzano, a principal with political strategy firm Latino Decisions, said Rubio won in 2010 by playing the role of outsider.

Six years later, Rubio is the insider, Manzano said. If he can remind voters in this short window that he railed against the establishment, he might have a shot. He has worked some pretty amazing political magic in the past.

Rubios campaign began with a lot of fanfare 11 months ago when he announced his candidacy at an April rally held at Miamis Freedom Tower, an iconic building that was used to provide assistance to Cuban immigrants in the 1960s. Freedom Tower offered Rubio the perfect backdrop to tell his story of being a second generation Cuban-American who grew up in a working-class home and rose to become one of Floridas most successful Latino politicians.

He entered a crowded field of candidates that included his one-time mentor and ex-Florida Governor Jeb Bush, whose front-runner status evaporated shortly after he entered the race. Before bowing out of the race in February, Bushs Right to Rise Super PAC reportedly spent close to $27 million attacking Rubio, who showed early signs of promise with strong third and second places finishes in the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries.

But since Bush left the race, Rubio has not been able to seize the moment. Hes only won Minnesota and Puerto Rico and his 152 delegate count pales to the 391 collected by Trump and 303 Texas Senator Ted Cruz has picked up. Floridas 99 delegates are among the 367 up for grabs on March 15.

Despite the long odds, Rubio backers are confident the race in Florida is still competitive. Miami GOP leader Diaz, who is personally supporting the senator, said a recent poll of early and absentee ballot voters shows Rubio leading Trump. I think Marco has a better chance of winning than people think he does, Diaz said. Looking at the turnout in Miami-Dade, it has been higher than expected.

Manzano of Latino Decisions said Rubio has to turn out his Latino base in Miami-Dade, which is heavily Cuban-American and Republican, to have a realistic shot at claiming Florida. Obviously a high turnout in South Florida among Cuban-Americans helps Rubio, Manzano said. Getting his base out is important. Then his campaign has to identify and target other spots in the primary electorate where he did well in the past.

A recent analysis by University of Florida political science professor Daniel A. Smith shows that the early voting turnout rate for the 274,000 registered Latino Republicans in Miami-Dade is at 79 percent, according to Politico. However, some of the votes may have gone to Bush since as many as 20,000 absentee ballots in Miami-Dade may have been cast while he was still in the race. The Washington Post reported that Conservative Solutions, a Super PAC backing Rubio, recently purchased $5 million in airtime in Florida to get early voters to the polls and get absentee voters to mail in their ballots.

In the last few days, Rubio has been traveling between Miami and the Orlando area, where hes been courting Puerto Rican Republicans, who account for a majority of the 54,000 registered Latino Republicans in the I-4 corridor. On March 8, the senator made a campaign stop at Maleo Bakery, a Puerto Rican eatery in Kissimmee where 200 supporters were on hand, according to Morris, Rubios I-4 campaign chair.

There was not one person who was not happy to see Marco, Morris said. The people I spoke to all said they were voting for him.

Morris, who has been on the national campaign committees for previous Republican nominees George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney, said she has yet to lose a presidential primary in the I-4 corridor. She was also with Rubio during the early days of his Senate campaign of 2010.

Back then we were at zero percent, Morris said. We were the underdogs going against the governor of Florida. We will help him accomplish what he needs to do in order to win. This is about the future of our country.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Aung San Suu Kyi's former driver nominated to lead Burma,[],"The party of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi confirmed Thursday that she will not become Burma's next president, instead nominating two loyalists for the post, including her former driver.

Unofficially, she has vowed to be the de-facto leader by calling the shots from behind the scenes, and party members said Thursday that's how things will work in Burma's first democratically elected government in more than a half century.

The party nominated two Suu Kyi loyalists for the post including the front runner Htin Kyaw, a 70-year-old Oxford graduate. Htin Kyaw was also her former driver, AFP reports.

The nomination will be followed by a vote among legislators later this month before the new president is installed April 1.

""I'm very happy and very pleased and I believe he (Htin Kyaw) will work together with Aung San Suu Kyi for the benefit of the people,"" said Khin Su Su Kyi, an NLD lawmaker.

For the past several weeks Suu Kyi is believed to have held closed-door talks with the powerful military generals to suspend a constitutional clause that bars her from the presidency.

The outcome of the negotiations was not known until Thursday when the names of the loyalists were announced, signaling the end, at least for now, of Suu Kyi's longtime ambition to be Burma's leader.

Suu Kyi did not attend Thursday's high-profile nomination session but posted a letter on Facebook to her legions of supporters. She called it a ""first step toward realizing the expectations and desires of the people who overwhelmingly supported the National League for Democracy in the elections.""

""It is our will to fulfill the people's desire,"" Suu Kyi said in the letter. ""We will try as hard as we can to do that.""

The longtime former political prisoner led her National League for Democracy to a landslide victory in Nov. 8 general elections, paving the way for the country's first democratically elected government since the military took power in 1962.

Despite her massive popular support, the 70-year-old Suu Kyi is blocked from the presidency because the constitution bars anyone with a foreign spouse or children from holding the executive office. Suu Kyi's two sons are British, as was her late husband. The clause is widely seen as having been written by the military with her in mind.

During Thursday's parliament session, the NLD nominated, from the lower house, Htin Kyaw, a longtime confidante and associate of Suu Kyi. He is widely respected and seen as a front runner.

""I think he is the best one for the country. He has experience, he's fair and he's a real gentleman so our country's future will be very good,"" said Kyaw Win Maung, an NLD lawmaker.

Htin Kyaw's father was a national poet and a National League for Democracy lawmaker from an aborted 1990 election, while his wife is a prominent legislator for the party in the current house. His father-in-law, a former army colonel, was a co-founder of the NLD.

From the upper house, the NLD nominated Henry Van Hti Yu of the ethnic Chin minority.

The outgoing ruling party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, also nominated two candidates  Sai Mauk Kham, currently a vice president, and former upper house speaker Khin Aung Myint.

The military bloc, which holds a constitutionally mandated 25 percent of seats, is also allowed to nominate one candidate. His name has not yet been announced. But he will likely become the country's other vice president.

A vote will be held later this month to elect the president and two vice presidents.

The NLD candidates are assured of a victory given the party's control of both chambers. One of them will become the president and the other will become a vice president.

Suu Kyi fought for decades to end dictatorship in Burma, and remains her party's unquestioned leader. She was awarded the 1991 Nobel prize while under house arrest, where she spent 15 years locked away by a junta that feared her political popularity.

Suu Kyi has made clear that even if she is not president she will be in charge.

Kyaw Thiha, an upper house NLD lawmaker, said Thursday that the new president will take orders from Suu Kyi.

""She cannot become the president, but it doesn't really matter because she will be controlling everything. She will be the one to control us,"" Kyaw Thiha said. ""It doesn't really matter that she is not becoming the president.""

Political analyst Toe Kyaw Hlaing predicted that the people won't have a problem with that arrangement.

""The public voted for change, so now the public wants a pure civilian president,"" he told The Associated Press. ""So when the civilian president comes to power, I think the public will support him, and the public may not care whether he is a proxy president or not.""

At least she had thata few minutes to enjoy the squeals of her adoring daughters and, after months of living close to a hospital in Wichita to play it safe, getting to see the century-old white farmhouse her family had worked so hard to make home.

""It was a good few minutes,"" Rott tells ABC News. Five minutes later, after complaining of chest pain, Casi was being raced down the gravel road by Joey, who knew he'd already lost her.

It had happened once already: Casi suffered a pulmonary embolism (a blood clot in her lungs) just days after the triplets were delivered by C-section, but the doctors and family thought that with medications everything was under control.

And while she lived to be able to see her girls again, Joey is now left to endure the tragic loss while caring for five children.

A family friend who also has triplets set up a GoFundMe page that asked for $10,000 and is already closing in on $100,000. Family members are also helping, and donations have been set up to help pay for a night service so that Joey, an IT worker, can sleep.

Chloe, the 7-year-old, is helping care for her toddler sister and hopes her mom's tombstone can be heart-shaped but flat on the bottom, so it can stand forever.

Ben McAdoo's first season as Giants head coach could turn on the recoveries of two key players, Jason Pierre-Paul and Victor Cruz. (AP Photo/Bill Kostroun, File)

The New York Giants came to an agreement with their veteran wide receiver Victor Cruz for the 2016 season that frees up salary cap space for the team.

The fan favorite who gained national attention for his salsa-dancing touchdown celebrations will receive a base payment of $1.3 million, instead of $7.9 million, a reduction of more than $6.5 million.

Once a Giant always a Giant. See you in September. A photo posted by Victor Cruz (@teamvic) on Mar 9, 2016 at 5:27pm PST

Bonuses and incentives could bring his payment up to $5.5 million.

The Giants and Cruz had been locked in discussions that were at times acrimonious, with the team reportedly threatening to cut the receiver unless his salary could be renegotiated. Cruz announced the agreement on Wednesday via Twitter and Instagram.

Cruz hasn't played most of the last two seasons, first because of a torn patellar tendon suffered in 2014. A calf strain required surgery and kept him off the field all of last season.

In his first two years as a regular player for the Giants in 2011 and 2012, Cruz gained more than 1,000 yards on 80-plus receptions each year, with a total of 19 touchdown catches.

In July 2013, Cruz signed a six-year, $44-million contract extension that would pay the receiver $7.4 million in 2017 and $8.4 million in 2018.

The terms of the renegotiated contract havent been released, and it isnt clear whether subsequent years in the extension will be affected.

In other moves on the first day of free agency, the Giants agreed to terms with former Miami pass rusher Olivier Vernon on a five-year, $85 million contract, signed former Rams cornerback Janoris Jenkins as well as defensive tackle Damon Harrison.

The team also re-signed defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul to a one-year, $10.5 million contract.

""I have one year to prove myself, but all I need is one,"" Pierre-Paul said in a statement. ""I know for a fact that I can play better than I did last year.""

Harrison, 27, will be play next to returning veteran Jonathan Hankins to form a solid middle. Though he had only a half-sack in 16 starts last year, Harrison is a noted run-stopper who was in on 72 tackles in 2015.

Harrison is expected to sign a five-year, $46.25 million contract, with $24 million guaranteed.

The Jenkins signing will likely end Prince Amukamara's Giants career. The 2011 first-round draft pick was told by the Giants to test the open market, where he expects to land a contract in the $10 million per year neighborhood despite an injury history that caused him to miss 25 out of 80-games in his career.

Jenkins will get slightly more than $12 million annually, making him the second-highest-paid cornerback behind the Jets' Darrelle Revis' $14.024 million average.

The Vernon, Harrison and Jenkins contracts will cost the Giants about $114 million in guaranteed salary.

I think Marco has a better chance of winning than people think he does, Diaz said. Looking at the turnout in Miami-Dade, it has been higher than expected.

Manzano of Latino Decisions said Rubio has to turn out his Latino base in Miami-Dade, which is heavily Cuban-American and Republican, to have a realistic shot at claiming Florida. Obviously a high turnout in South Florida among Cuban-Americans helps Rubio, Manzano said. Getting his base out is important. Then his campaign has to identify and target other spots in the primary electorate where he did well in the past.

A recent analysis by University of Florida political science professor Daniel A. Smith shows that the early voting turnout rate for the 274,000 registered Latino Republicans in Miami-Dade is at 79 percent, according to Politico. However, some of the votes may have gone to Bush since as many as 20,000 absentee ballots in Miami-Dade may have been cast while he was still in the race. The Washington Post reported that Conservative Solutions, a Super PAC backing Rubio, recently purchased $5 million in airtime in Florida to get early voters to the polls and get absentee voters to mail in their ballots.

In the last few days, Rubio has been traveling between Miami and the Orlando area, where hes been courting Puerto Rican Republicans, who account for a majority of the 54,000 registered Latino Republicans in the I-4 corridor. On March 8, the senator made a campaign stop at Maleo Bakery, a Puerto Rican eatery in Kissimmee where 200 supporters were on hand, according to Morris, Rubios I-4 campaign chair.

There was not one person who was not happy to see Marco, Morris said. The people I spoke to all said they were voting for him.

Morris, who has been on the national campaign committees for previous Republican nominees George W. Bush, John McCain and Mitt Romney, said she has yet to lose a presidential primary in the I-4 corridor. She was also with Rubio during the early days of his Senate campaign of 2010.

Back then we were at zero percent, Morris said. We were the underdogs going against the governor of Florida. We will help him accomplish what he needs to do in order to win. This is about the future of our country.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Aaaaaaah, really? You would die if you didn't sigh",[],"How many times per day do you sigh? Chances are, the number in your head is off by a factor of about 10, according to a new study.

People actually sigh about 12 times every hour, or once every five minutes, researchers found. But these audible exhalations don't necessarily signal tiredness or exasperation. Rather, physiological sighs are vital to keeping the lungs functioning properly, the scientists said.

Now, researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and Stanford University have identified the source of sighing, which they classify as a life-sustaining reflex that prevents air sacs located in the lungs, called alveoli, from collapsing. [15 Weird Things Humans Do Every Day, and Why]

""A human lung has as much surface area as a tennis court, and so that's all folded inside your chest,"" study co-author Jack Feldman, a professor of neurobiology at UCLA, told Live Science. ""The way that nature did it is that there's 500 million little air sacs called alveoli. And each alveolus is a little sphere, about 0.2 millimeters [0.008 inches] in diameter.""

These tiny, round sacs help ensure that sufficient amounts of oxygen can pass easily into the blood through the lung membranes, and Feldman described them as being similar to ""wet balloons.""

""Did you ever try blowing up a wet balloon? It's very difficult, because the water on the inside sticks together,"" he said. ""This is what happens when an alveolus collapses ... and whenever they collapse, that surface area gets taken out of the ability to exchange gas.""

In other words, if humans weren't able to sigh, the alveoli wouldn't be able to reinflate, and the lungs would fail. Feldman said the only way to pop alveoli open again is to take a deep breath, which humans tend to do every 5 minutes.

""In the early days of using mechanical ventilation like iron lungs, people were inflated just with normal lung volumes, and a lot of them died because their alveoli collapsed,"" Feldman said. ""Now, when you see someone getting respiratory therapy on a ventilator, you'll notice that every couple of minutes, there's a huge breath that is superimposed, and that is playing the role of a sigh.""

So, a sigh is like a double breath, Feldman said, and it doesn't necessarily have to be a loud exhale like you might do when you're huffing or expressing relief. [Gasp! 11 Surprising Facts About the Respiratory System]

However, Feldman said that sighs are actually associated with emotions in a different way, because sigh rates tend to go up when someone is stressed. One of the things that happen to a body under stress is that the brain releases molecules known as peptides, which are protein subunits. Some of these are called bombesin-related peptides.

Bombesin isn't present in mammals, the researchers said, and is actually a toxin found in the skin of a European fire-bellied toad. However, mammals have receptors for it, and previous research found that peptides called neuromedin B (NMB) and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) are the equivalent in mammals, including humans.

Feldman's own previous research identified that injecting bombesin into an area of the brain called the pre-Botzinger complex increased the sigh rate of rats from 25 times an hour to about 400, while their breathing rate stayed more or less the same.

In comparison, when a special toxin that can kill cells that express the receptor for bombesin was injected into the same area, the animals stopped sighing altogether but continued to breathe normally otherwise, the researchers said.

In the new study, Feldman collaborated with Mark Krasnow, a professor of biochemistry at Stanford University, and his research team. Krasnow had been supervising a Stanford student named Kevin Yackle, who was inspired by a talk Feldman gave about how the brain controls breathing. Yackle went to Krasnow with his idea to go through an online database of 14,000 molecules of the brain and use it as a way of trying to piece together how the nervous system works.

Krasnow and his team were keen to collaborate with Feldman when they realized that he had been simultaneously researching bombesin-related peptides. The Stanford team had identified two molecules, NMB and GRP, that were highly concentrated in regions of the brain that are important for breathing but are found almost nowhere else in the brain. At the time, the researchers didn't know what these molecules were for, but by teaming up with Feldman, the scientists were able to analyze around 14,000 gene expression patterns in the brain cells of mice. They identify around 200 neurons in the mouse brain stem that are responsible for producing and releasing bombesinlike peptides.

""We identified about 400 neurons [in] total that were key for triggering sighs,"" Feldman said. ""That's not a lot of neurons to be involved in a fundamental behavior.""

The researchers think their findings could offer insight into other parts of the nervous system and into the mechanisms that may underlie more complex behaviors in humans.

But when it comes to researching the nervous system, it can be a bit like learning a language, Feldman said.

""It's a little bit like saying, 'If you want to understand the English language, do you start with Shakespeare, or [do] you start with Dr. Seuss?"" he said. ""The vocabulary is simpler, the number of words [is] simpler, but there are a lot of fundamental principles involved in Dr. Seuss that are going to tell us a lot about Shakespeare.""

And when it comes to learning Shakespeare, ""we have to increase the vocabulary, the sophistication ... but it builds on a foundation,"" he added.

The research could have potential applications for the development of medicine to treat certain conditions, the researchers said. With some anxiety disorders, for instance, people may sigh too much, which can be debilitating. And some people don't sigh enough, which can lead to breathing problems and compromised lung function, the scientists said.

Feldman said he wants to do further research on what individual neurons are doing when a person sighs, and he is interested in breaking down how these neurons are organized.

""An immediate question is, when you apply these peptides in normal inspiratory, bursts become a sigh; a double burst,"" he said. ""Why? What's happening to the neurons? What's happening to the circuit? You don't know. That's a fundamentally important question, not just for sighs but for understanding how the nervous system is transforming information and processing signals.""

The research was published online Feb. 8 in the journal Nature.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Aung San Suu Kyi's former driver nominated to lead Burma,[],"The party of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi confirmed Thursday that she will not become Burma's next president, instead nominating two loyalists for the post, including her former driver.

Unofficially, she has vowed to be the de-facto leader by calling the shots from behind the scenes, and party members said Thursday that's how things will work in Burma's first democratically elected government in more than a half century.

The party nominated two Suu Kyi loyalists for the post including the front runner Htin Kyaw, a 70-year-old Oxford graduate. Htin Kyaw was also her former driver, AFP reports.

The nomination will be followed by a vote among legislators later this month before the new president is installed April 1.

""I'm very happy and very pleased and I believe he (Htin Kyaw) will work together with Aung San Suu Kyi for the benefit of the people,"" said Khin Su Su Kyi, an NLD lawmaker.

For the past several weeks Suu Kyi is believed to have held closed-door talks with the powerful military generals to suspend a constitutional clause that bars her from the presidency.

The outcome of the negotiations was not known until Thursday when the names of the loyalists were announced, signaling the end, at least for now, of Suu Kyi's longtime ambition to be Burma's leader.

Suu Kyi did not attend Thursday's high-profile nomination session but posted a letter on Facebook to her legions of supporters. She called it a ""first step toward realizing the expectations and desires of the people who overwhelmingly supported the National League for Democracy in the elections.""

""It is our will to fulfill the people's desire,"" Suu Kyi said in the letter. ""We will try as hard as we can to do that.""

The longtime former political prisoner led her National League for Democracy to a landslide victory in Nov. 8 general elections, paving the way for the country's first democratically elected government since the military took power in 1962.

Despite her massive popular support, the 70-year-old Suu Kyi is blocked from the presidency because the constitution bars anyone with a foreign spouse or children from holding the executive office. Suu Kyi's two sons are British, as was her late husband. The clause is widely seen as having been written by the military with her in mind.

During Thursday's parliament session, the NLD nominated, from the lower house, Htin Kyaw, a longtime confidante and associate of Suu Kyi. He is widely respected and seen as a front runner.

""I think he is the best one for the country. He has experience, he's fair and he's a real gentleman so our country's future will be very good,"" said Kyaw Win Maung, an NLD lawmaker.

Htin Kyaw's father was a national poet and a National League for Democracy lawmaker from an aborted 1990 election, while his wife is a prominent legislator for the party in the current house. His father-in-law, a former army colonel, was a co-founder of the NLD.

From the upper house, the NLD nominated Henry Van Hti Yu of the ethnic Chin minority.

The outgoing ruling party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, also nominated two candidates  Sai Mauk Kham, currently a vice president, and former upper house speaker Khin Aung Myint.

The military bloc, which holds a constitutionally mandated 25 percent of seats, is also allowed to nominate one candidate. His name has not yet been announced. But he will likely become the country's other vice president.

A vote will be held later this month to elect the president and two vice presidents.

The NLD candidates are assured of a victory given the party's control of both chambers. One of them will become the president and the other will become a vice president.

Suu Kyi fought for decades to end dictatorship in Burma, and remains her party's unquestioned leader. She was awarded the 1991 Nobel prize while under house arrest, where she spent 15 years locked away by a junta that feared her political popularity.

Suu Kyi has made clear that even if she is not president she will be in charge.

Kyaw Thiha, an upper house NLD lawmaker, said Thursday that the new president will take orders from Suu Kyi.

""She cannot become the president, but it doesn't really matter because she will be controlling everything. She will be the one to control us,"" Kyaw Thiha said. ""It doesn't really matter that she is not becoming the president.""

Political analyst Toe Kyaw Hlaing predicted that the people won't have a problem with that arrangement.

""The public voted for change, so now the public wants a pure civilian president,"" he told The Associated Press. ""So when the civilian president comes to power, I think the public will support him, and the public may not care whether he is a proxy president or not.""

The New York Times best-selling author has a new book out called Tiny and Full: Discover Why Only Eating A Vegan Breakfast Will Keep You Tiny And Full For Life that boasts the power of eating a vegan breakfast as a prime weapon in the battle to lose weight.

Cruise says eating strictly a breakfast with plant-based whole foods  fruits and vegetables  could help you lose a minimum of 43 pounds in eight weeks. He says eating vegan in the morning keeps you feeling full throughout the day and eating less.

""The key is being a vegan until lunch,"" Cruise says. ""If you can just do that one thing ... then you're set.""

Eating vegan in the morning is the best time, Cruise explains, because it's when your willpower is strongest. Resisting unhealthy trigger foods is easier in the morning and gets you started on the right foot.

Also, Cruise contends, eating a vegan breakfast will help you cut calories while not suffering from the terrible withdrawal feelings of hunger. The secret is that plant-based foods are low in calorie density, allowing you to consume larger amounts of low calories density foods at fewer calories overall.

For instance, 2 Oreo cookies are equivalent to the calories you'll get from 62 grapes. And 8 Doritos equal 25 medium strawberries. Both examples are 100 calories.

Watch our video interview above with the renowned celebrity trainer himself, Jorge Cruise, who explains how to get that summer body.

Htin Kyaw's father was a national poet and a National League for Democracy lawmaker from an aborted 1990 election, while his wife is a prominent legislator for the party in the current house. His father-in-law, a former army colonel, was a co-founder of the NLD.

From the upper house, the NLD nominated Henry Van Hti Yu of the ethnic Chin minority.

The outgoing ruling party, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, also nominated two candidates  Sai Mauk Kham, currently a vice president, and former upper house speaker Khin Aung Myint.

The military bloc, which holds a constitutionally mandated 25 percent of seats, is also allowed to nominate one candidate. His name has not yet been announced. But he will likely become the country's other vice president.

A vote will be held later this month to elect the president and two vice presidents.

The NLD candidates are assured of a victory given the party's control of both chambers. One of them will become the president and the other will become a vice president.

Suu Kyi fought for decades to end dictatorship in Burma, and remains her party's unquestioned leader. She was awarded the 1991 Nobel prize while under house arrest, where she spent 15 years locked away by a junta that feared her political popularity.

Suu Kyi has made clear that even if she is not president she will be in charge.

Kyaw Thiha, an upper house NLD lawmaker, said Thursday that the new president will take orders from Suu Kyi.

""She cannot become the president, but it doesn't really matter because she will be controlling everything. She will be the one to control us,"" Kyaw Thiha said. ""It doesn't really matter that she is not becoming the president.""

Political analyst Toe Kyaw Hlaing predicted that the people won't have a problem with that arrangement.

""The public voted for change, so now the public wants a pure civilian president,"" he told The Associated Press. ""So when the civilian president comes to power, I think the public will support him, and the public may not care whether he is a proxy president or not.""

Buzz Cuts:

 Trump or Cruz, who runs better against Hillary?

 Kasich ahead in Ohio

 Crubio?

 Hillary says Benghazi mom absolutely wrong

 A fever for small government



TRUMP OR CRUZ, WHO RUNS BETTER AGAINST HILLARY?Republicans are down to their final choice: Donald Trump or Ted Cruz. And for party loyalists, the decision basically comes down to which one  if either  can defeat presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

Theres a lot of talk about Trumps potential crossover appeal with whats left of white, working-class male Democrats. Cruz, for his part, argues that he would mobilize conservatives in a way not seen in a generation and storm the White House.



Fortunately, we have some actual data to test their hypotheses.



In the two latest national polls that measured head-to-head matchups between GOP contenders and Clinton, the harsh judgement of the general electorate toward frontrunner Trump got even harsher.



Surveys from WSJ/NBC News and WaPo/ABC News show Clinton trouncing Trump by 13 points and 9 points respectively. Trump has always fared poorly in head-to-head matchups with Clinton, leading her in only five of 49 national polls conducted since last year.



But things seem to be getting worse  approaching a Dukakis-sized wipeout for the GOP  and its not because of anything Clinton is doing. She continues to mostly trail Cruz as well as other nominal candidates.



So whats the deal?



Trumps abysmal numbers with women and struggles with better-educated voters are probably the driving forces behind his overall problems with beating Clinton. But hes also suffering because of the deepening rift in his own party. Trump is trying hard to show some graciousness toward his fellow Republicans, but we can still expect this final pairing between him and Cruz to be an atomic blast of nastiness.



Theres also the barrage of negative advertising with which conservative groups are now pummeling Trump. Though designed to defeat him in the GOP primary, the devastating attacks on Trumps character and business record will have an effect beyond the GOP electorate. Much like the case with the 2012 Republican nominee, the attacks of the primary season will carry over in the general election. The attacks on Mitt Romney over his business record and taxes started with his primary rivals in January and ended with his eventual November defeat.



Should Trump actually sew up the Republican nomination outright, he would certainly see his numbers improve. Theres always a bit of a dowry for the nominee as intra-party rivals soften their resistance following primary fights. But that effect is likely to be muted this time given the murderous fighting and the depth of the divide between Trumps populist revolt and the rest of the party.



But there is no evidence that Trumps Democratic crossover appeal is nearly significant enough to offset his other huge demographic problems.



Of course, neither is there any evidence to suggest that Cruzs conservative call to arms will change the electorate in a meaningful way. Its just that Cruz isnt starting in the deep hole that Trump is to start.



Cruz has not yet been subject to the avalanche of attack ads that would surely greet him in a general election and Trumps ugly, personal attacks on Cruz will also surely intensify in the near term.



But for now, its safe to say that Cruz is a better general election bet than Trump. Theres more variability with Trump  positive and negative  but Cruz can at least promise to essentially keep the GOP coalition intact and at least keep it close with Clinton.



Kasich ahead in Ohio - Fox News: Ohio Governor John Kasich bests Donald Trump among Buckeye Republicans by a 34 to 29 percent margin. Ted Cruz is third with 19 percent. Marco Rubio trails with just 7 percent. Thats according to a new Fox News poll of Ohio likely Republican primary voters. The governors edge is within the polls margin of sampling error. Kasich is bolstered by positive evaluations of his job performance as governor. He has a sky high 79 percent approval rating among the Ohio party faithful. Even so, nearly one quarter of Kasich supporters say they could end up voting for another candidate (23 percent).

Chinese food in America is now a staple of the national diet. But despite a lengthy presence in the U.S. the national boom for Chinese food is relatively recent. In a discussion with author Andrew Coe, the Atlantic explains how Chinese food came to America and why this cultures cuisine took off in the United States: It wasnt until adventurous Bohemians in New York City started exploring Chinatown in the 1880s for exotic treats that the food started to become popular. In the years since, Chinese food as understood by Americans has undergone several cycles of trendiness and localization, including the chop suey craze of the early 20th century to the explosion in variety after President Richard Nixons 1972 trip to China.

According to the opposition-leaning pharmaceutical association, the country is making due with 20 percent of the medications it requires.

They gather by the hundreds at border bridges before dawn, in wheelchairs and surgical masks. They clutch X-rays and bundles of medical records they hope will persuade Venezuelan officials to let them join the few allowed to cross into Colombia each day.

Six months after Venezuela's socialist government shut its border with Colombia to fight smuggling, thousands of patients continue to make an arduous trek to get treatment in Colombian hospitals.

The closure has reshaped daily life for everyone along the frontier, but for sick Venezuelans hoping to escape their country's collapsed medical system, the consequences have been painful and sometimes deadly.

Dany Cubides, a 33-year-old dialysis patient, collapsed early this year on the bridge connecting this town of brightly painted shacks with the Colombian city of Cucuta as he made his way back home after treatment.

Before the border closing, the trip had taken him 30 minutes on a motorcycle. But vehicles are no longer allowed to pass between the two countries, and patients who get special permission to cross must do so on foot.

Cubides' trips to a dialysis center in Cucuta turned into multi-hour ordeals that left him too tired to eat dinner. He gave up his job as a city gardener. Then, one hot afternoon shortly after New Year's Day, he stumbled and fell on the bridge. He was dead by the time he arrived at a Cucuta hospital, his medical records and death certificate show.

""This never would have happened if not for the closure. It was day after day of fatigue for him,"" said his mother, Elvira Cubides, wiping away tears. ""This country has lost its heart.""

Perhaps the only thing worse than slogging to a clinic in Colombia is slogging through the Venezuelan health care system, which is beset by the economic chaos ravaging the country as a whole. Public hospitals here no longer have consistent running water and electricity, and medical supplies are scarce. The country is making due with 20 percent of the medications it requires, according to the opposition-leaning pharmaceutical association.

In San Cristobal, the Venezuelan city closest to Urena, six infants died during a single week in February because of a lack of respiratory machines. This month, a congressman accused the city's largest hospital of using expired drugs. Private clinics run their dialysis machines in three shifts to accommodate as many people as possible, and still have no room for new patients.

Noe Leal, a 66-year-old taxi driver in Urena whose kidneys are failing, shuns San Cristobal's chaotic hospitals, preferring instead to grapple with officialdom as he crosses the border three times a week for treatment in Cucuta.

He wakes with his roosters before dawn and braces himself for an interrogation at the border checkpoint despite having the proper papers, and then the long walk across the 1,050-foot (320-meter) bridge spanning the Tachira river.

""You feel like you're filled with liquid, and your legs don't want to move. But you have to walk or you won't get your treatment,"" he said.

As a terminal patient, Leal was able to get permanent permission to cross. Most Venezuelans have to apply for a one-day pass the morning of their appointments.

Officials issue about 200 medical passes a day for this town of 40,000 people. Patients stood in line for hours last week only to find the National Guard had added new requirements. The director of the permissions center was as outraged as they were.

""They're playing with people's lives, making grandfathers, people who can barely walk, come and wait like this all day,"" center director Luis Hernando said, drawing cheers.

The National Guard says smuggling of price-controlled gasoline and food into Colombia, where it can be sold at much higher prices, has fallen 70 percent since President Nicolas Maduro declared a state of emergency along the 1,400-mile (2,260-kilomber) border last August. Officials on the Colombian side also say the tide of cheap Venezuelan goods has slowed.

Before the border was shut, more than 100,000 people daily used the two main crossings in the region that includes Urena, according to the Venezuelan government. That number has shrunk to just 3,000 a day, nonprofit groups working in the region say.

In addition to the sick, Venezuela allows students, some workers and any Colombians wishing to self-deport to cross.

Parents leading small children in school uniforms and sleepy undergraduates join the sick in trying to get through the barbed-wire checkpoints early. By 8 a.m., confusion reigns.

On one recent morning, a National Guard officer told a family hoping to enroll their daughter in a Colombian high school that they would have to go to a different crossing. Asked why, he responded, ""Because I say so.""

An HIV patient was turned away for failing to bring his complete medical history, and left grumbling that each soldier creates his own laws.

Deli worker Olga Burgos was rejected because an oncologist wrote the wrong date on paperwork for her appointment. ""I'll have to just try again tomorrow,"" she said.

Libia Zulay blames the whims of border guards for the death of her 3-year-old grandson Jheancarlo, who had leukemia.

Shortly before Christmas, the toddler went into convulsions in his crib. Zulay rushed him to a clinic in Urena, but staff told her only the hospitals across the border would be able to help. Guards at the checkpoint said the family had to wait until the crossing opened at 6 a.m.

The family decided against risking an illegal crossing in a motorboat at night. They waited, taking turns holding the boy in their arms as his lips turned blue and gaze faded. He died the next day in Cucuta, according to his medical records and death certificate.

""I was desperate, crying and pleading all the way up the chain of command for them to let us cross,"" Zulay said. ""I was astonished they would gamble with the life of a child like that. One day they will have to pay for the dead.""

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Large Hadron Collider results may hint at a new era of physics,['James Rogers'],"Are we about to enter a new era of physics? Data collected by the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland may have identified particle activity that doesnt fit the standard laws of physics.

The analysis by scientists including physicists at the Institute of Nuclear Physics at the Polish Academy of Sciences (IFJ PAN) could have huge scientific implications.

There are some indications that physicists working at the LHC accelerator at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva may see the first traces of physics beyond the current theory which describes the structure of matter, said the IFJ PAN, in a recent press release.

The structure of matter is described by a theoretical framework called The Standard Model, which identifies the roles played by different particles. Boson particles, for example, are carriers of forces, whereas photons are related to electromagnetic interactions. Matter is formed by particles called fermions.

However, scientists, analyzing data collected by the LHCb experiment in 2011 and 2012, noticed an anomaly in the decay of a particle called a B Meson. According to the research, the traditional method for determining the particles decay may lead to false results.

Related: Science breakthrough? Physicists may have discovered Higgs boson relative



Could the anomaly hint at a new understanding of the Universe? Scientists are certainly intrigued by the anomaly. To put it in terms of the cinema, where we once only had a few leaked scenes from an much-anticipated blockbuster, the LHC has finally treated fans to the first real trailer,"" said Professor Mariusz Witek of IFJ PAN, in the release.

Witek notes that the framework used to describe the structure of matter poses plenty of questions for scientists. The Standard Model cannot explain all the features of the Universe, he said. It doesnt predict the masses of particles or tell us why fermions are organized in three families. How did the dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe come about? What is dark matter? Those questions remain unanswered.

To further illustrate his point, the Professor notes that gravity isnt even included in the Standard Model.

However, scientists caution that more research is needed on the B Meson anomaly. We cant call it a discovery. Not yet, said the IFJ PAN.

CERN spokesman Arnaud Marsollier told FoxNews.com that the B Meson data, which first emerged last year, are not conclusive. More data are needed before we can tell anything significant on this, so we will have to wait for the LHC to restart (soon), he explained via email, noting the importance of patience when recording and analyzing data. Science needs time! he added.

Related: Revamped Large Hadron Collider set to restart

CERN is currently starting powering tests on the huge particle accelerator. Beams should be back by the end of the month or early April, and collisions sometimes next month if everything goes as planned, said Marsollier.

Oxford University Physics Professor Guy Wilkinson, who serves as the spokesman for the LHCb experiment, told FoxNews.com that CERNs B Meson data is extremely interesting, but noted that it could be a couple of years before scientists perform a full analysis. When we analyse this new sample in a year or two we will be able to make a fresh and, I hope, more categorical statement on this topic, he explained, via email.

The 17-mile LHC was built between 1998 and 2008 to help scientists test some theories of particle and high-energy physics and advance understanding of physical laws.

In 2012 the Collider won global acclaim with the discovery of the long-sought Higgs boson particle, which explains the behavior of other particles. Physicists Peter Higgs and Francois Englert were subsequently awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Maggie (Kelly McCreary) and Andrew (Giacomo Gianniotti) may hit the first bump in the road of their relationship on Thursday's episode of ""Grey's Anatomy,"" when the pressure of keeping their romance under wraps starts to become an issue.

""We've seen so far, with Maggie and DeLuca, that they've not been very successful at keeping their relationship a secret,"" McCreary tells TVGuide.com. ""I'll just say that the stress of that sort of starts to bear down on DeLuca in particular, and they're faced with a reality check about what they're doing.""

Adds Gianniotti: ""Something happens that makes them both sort of solidify their stance on how they feel about the relationship.""

'Grey's Anatomy's' Sarah Drew: There's a ""tremendous sense of hope"" for Jackson and April

McCreary points out that Maggie and Andrew's relationship - if we can even call it that at this point -- happened almost by accident, and both may find themselves in over their heads.

""I think this whole thing snuck up on Maggie,"" McCreary says. ""What's been fun to play is watching her enjoy it, and not try to run away from it. She's certainly trying to keep things compartmentalized, and [faces] the challenges that human beings face when they try to be so in control of every part of their lives.""

Suffice it to say, even though Maggie and Webber (James Pickens Jr.) have reached a tacit understanding about her relationship with Andrew, Andrew's still reeling from the revelation that he's essentially sleeping with his boss' daughter. Had he known that from the beginning, he may not have pursued a relationship with Maggie, Gianniotti notes.

""That was a huge blow for Andrew,"" Gianniotti says. ""That adds a whole other layer of complications and that's not what he signed up for. I think him getting this deep and then finding that out was a little bit hard for him, because it sort of adds a whole other layer of pressure. ... Obviously, because the time has passed, he is deeply invested in Maggie, so he's not at the point where he's willing to throw that all to the wind just because of that. However, yes, it's a very different terrain now that he's navigating with this knowledge.""

VIDEO: How well do the stars of 'Grey's Anatomy' know medical jargon?

And on Maggie's side, she's worried about what a nonprofessional relationship with an underling will do to her reputation - though, of course, such a dynamic is hardly unusual at Grey Sloan. ""I think Maggie's personal problem with it has to do with her experience of always being the youngest and the smallest and having to work really hard to be taken seriously as a professional,"" McCreary says. ""She doesn't realize how accepted she is at the hospital, and respected. As far as I can tell, she doesn't realize that that's not at stake for her here. She's finally in a place where she's established as a leader, and can relax in that position. But she doesn't know that, because that hasn't been her experience.""

Though they share similar hesitations (as well as a history of being unlucky in love), Maggie and Andrew find themselves at odds in Thursday's episode, and they come to a surprising decision as a result.

The minute-and-a-half ad features a boy coming out to his father by writing, I like boys on a McCafe coffee cup and sliding it across the table.

The father initially seems upset, and walks away. But he quickly returns with his own coffee cup and writes, I accept that you like boys. Music swells and the son cries tears of joy. The spot closes with the tag, ""Let there be more warmth in conversations.""

On YouTube the ad has over 6,900 likes and has been viewed 1.6 million times. According to the Shanghaiist, the spot has received mostly positive feedback from local viewers.

But the Alliance of Taiwan Religious Groups for the Protection of Family is condemning the ad, saying it promotes homosexual behavior.

""Because McDonalds is frequented by many children, it is especially important to oppose the promotion of same-sex behavior,"" Chang Shou-yi of the Alliance of Taiwan Religious Groups for the Protection of Family, told Taiwanese media. Chang accused McDonald's of ""openly promoting gay issues"" and mis-educating children on sexual behavior.

The group is calling for a nationwide boycott of the restaurant.

When the spot debuted on March 6, Brenda Kou, who heads McDonalds marketing department in Taiwan, told Apple Daily that the brands intent was to show the spirit of open dialogue between family members. She also said that McDonalds wanted to express that different voices can be accepted in society.

Same-sex marriage is not legally recognized in Taiwan, although seven cities currently accept household registrations of same-sex couples.

According to Shanghaiist, a poll conducted by Taiwan's Ministry of Justice found that nearly 60 percent of respondents approved of same-sex marriage. The countrys president-elect Tsai Ing-wen expressed her support for the LGBT community in a campaign video saying, ""In the face of love, everyone is equal. Let everyone have the freedom to love and to pursue their happiness.""

But various Christian organizations have been leading a vocal campaign to fight the legalization of same-sex unions.

McDonalds has used a similar concept in other countries and in 2010, the fast food chain featured a similar spot in France but the son does not directly come out to his father.",[]

Cruz also said Trump is taking advantage of his voters  which is roughly the same charge the GOP front-runner leveled at his Republican detractors during a Fox News town hall Wednesday night.

At the forum, Trump pushed back against what appears to be a growing movement among the party establishment  including a few of his former rivals  to at least slow march to the convention with enough delegates in hand to claim the nomination.

The billionaire businessman called his campaign a movement ""of competence and common sense and low taxes and [secure] borders and it would be so foolish to give it away.""

They want stuff flowing across the borders. They dont want to have taxation when countries treat us unfairly because they benefit from that.""

Cruzs comments about Trumps supporters comes ahead of another Republican debate Thursday night in Florida, the site of one of five big primaries next Tuesday. The stakes are higher than ever, as those five primaries could decide the fate of Trumps remaining rivals.

As Trump builds his delegate lead over the field following a string of wins earlier this week, Cruz is positioning himself as the one candidate who could actually beat Trump in the end  citing several primary and caucus victories, most recently in Idaho.

He was buoyed Wednesday by the endorsement of former candidate Carly Fiorina. And, speaking with Fox News Megyn Kelly, he said the other two candidates in the race  Marco Rubio and John Kasich  do not have a path to the nomination.

""Head-to-head, not only do I beat Donald Trump,"" Cruz said, ""but I defeat him resoundingly.""

Rubio is under tremendous pressure to win Florida next week, his home state. But a Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Rubio trailing Trump by 23 percentage points among likely Republican voters in Florida.

Rubio, though, told Kelly he has no intention of dropping out right now.

""I have never discussed dropping out with anyone on my team, or anyone on the planet Earth ... I'm the only one who can beat Donald Trump in Florida, he said.

Rubio also dismissed the possibility that he would form a so-called ""unity"" Republican ticket with Cruz, Trump's closest challenger in the delegate race, calling it "" the kind of drama that makes it interesting in TV to speculate about.""

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Obama says he's proud of pulling back from Syria airstrikes,[],"President Obama said he's proud of the moment he pulled the U.S. from the brink of launching airstrikes against the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad, calling it the right decision to make.

In interviews with The Atlantic magazine published Thursday, Obama also called out U.S. allies who call for tougher U.S. action in Mideast conflicts but fail to take risks themselves, describing them as ""free-riders."" He cast the sectarian conflicts roiling the region as a competition between Iran and close U.S. partner Saudi Arabia, and he urged both to find ""an effective way to share the neighborhood.""

Of his 2013 decision not to strike Assad's government, he said: ""I'm very proud of this moment.""

""For me to press the pause button at that moment, I knew, would cost me politically,"" Obama said. ""And the fact that I was able to pull back from the immediate pressures and think through in my own mind what was in America's interest, not only with respect to Syria but also with respect to our democracy, was as tough a decision as I've made.""

Obama had been close to ordering strikes to punish Assad for using chemical weapons against Syrians, with plans for military action ready to go. At the last minute, he said he'd ask for permission from Congress. The strikes never happened.

The reversal has become a prime example cited by those who argue Obama has lost his credibility in the Middle East, having failed to take action despite threatening that Assad's use of chemical weapons would cross a ""red line"" and trigger tough U.S. response. To Obama's critics, the ""red line"" epitomizes his reluctance to use U.S. leadership and military might to promote U.S. interests in a dangerous region.

Obama acknowledged the broad perception that ""America's credibility was at stake"" in the 2013 decision not to strike. Yet he said that ""ultimately it was the right decision to make.""

In the interviews, which took place over many months, Obama offered an unusually blunt assessment of American allies in Europe and in the Persian Gulf region, especially regarding Libya, where a 2011 NATO intervention backed by the U.S. led to a vacuum of power that has fueled chaos and allowed extremist groups to thrive. Obama acknowledged that the intervention ""didn't work,"" but also faulted allies who are closer geographically to Libya for relying too much on the U.S.

""What has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game,"" Obama said. Asked if he meant they were free-riders, Obama repeated, ""Free-riders.""",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,8 men sentenced to 3 years in jail for enslaving fishermen,[],"Five Thai fishing boat captains and three Indonesians were sentenced Thursday to three years in jail for human trafficking in connection with slavery in the seafood industry.

The suspects were arrested in the remote island village of Benjina last May after the abuse was revealed by The Associated Press in a report two months earlier. The men were tried separately in Tual, an island in southeastern Maluku province, about 2,900 kilometers (1,800 miles) east of Jakarta.

The three-judge panel also ordered the defendants to pay fines of about $12,250 each or serve two more months in jail. In addition, the Thai captains  Youngyut Nitiwongchaeron, Boonsom Jaika, Surachai Maneephong, Hatsaphon Phaetjakreng and Somchit Korraneesuk  have to pay a total of $67,800 in compensation to their crew members.

""They all have been proven guilty of violating the anti-human trafficking law,"" said Edi Toto Purba, who led the panel. ""They deserve the jail sentences as well as the fine.""

He gave one week for the prosecutors, who had sought heavier sentences, as well as the defendants to appeal the verdict. Indonesian prosecutors had demanded prison sentences of up to 4 1/2 years for the five Thais and Indonesian Hermanwir Martino, and 3 1/2-year sentences for two other Indonesians, Yopi Hanorsian and Muklis Ohoitenan. They also demanded compensation ranging from $3,750 to $26,000 for the crew members.

Thirteen fishermen from Myanmar testified under protection of Indonesia's Witness and Victim Protection Agency. They told the court they had been tortured, forced to work up to 24 hours a day and not paid. They also said they were locked in a prison-like cell in a compound owned by fishing company Pusaka Benjina Resources, which has since been shut down. Martino and Ohoitenan worked for the company, and Hanorsian was known as the ""enforcer"" among the fishermen, who accused him of beating and torturing them in front of an Indonesian flag until they collapsed.

Some workers were angered by the outcome.

""They should be sentenced more because they tortured many fishermen for years. It's not fair for us,"" said Win Ko Naing, 26, who was enslaved in Benjina for almost six years. He has been following the case closely from Myanmar, but did not testify at the trial.

""They will never pay us compensation because they know how to get away from punishment,"" he added. ""I will never forget what they did to many people over many years. Three years imprisonment is too easy for them. ""

The AP investigation found that thousands of poor migrant fishermen, mostly from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, were recruited in Thailand and brought to Indonesia using fake travel documents where they were subjected to brutal labor abuses. Some had been enslaved for years or decades. The AP found some men locked in a cage and saw others calling out for help over the railing of their trawler. A company graveyard with dozens of bodies buried under fake names was also located. The Indonesian government carried out a dramatic rescue in Benjina in April, just over a week after the report ran.

More than 2,000 men were freed and sent home last year as a result of the investigation, which traced slave-caught seafood to some of the most well-known U.S. grocery stores and pet food brands, including Wal-Mart, Sysco, Kroger, Fancy Feast, Meow Mix and Iams. In addition, U.S. congressional hearings have been held, legislation has been changed, more than a dozen people have been arrested and multi-million dollar seafood cargo ships have been seized.

All-Star Chris Archer had a rough start for the Rays, allowing two first-inning runs on wild pitches. Goins singled off the Tampa Bay ace in the first and had a two-run single off Ryan Webb in the fourth to boost his batting average to .357 with six RBIs this spring.

Happ allowed one run and four hits in 2 2-3 innings.

Archer retired his first batter before yielding two singles and a walk that loaded the bases. Goins scored on the first wild pitch of the inning, and Toronto added another run when another pitch got away from Archer after he walked Junior Lake to re-load the bases.

''I think the biggest thing was whenever I got a few guys on base, I was trying to do a little bit too much,'' said Archer, who threw 32 pitches in the first inning.

''It's nice to have challenges in spring training present themselves,'' Archer added, ''because that way when you get to the season it's not unfamiliar.''

Curt Casali drove in Tampa Bay's run with a second-inning single.

STARTING TIME

Blue Jays: Happ pitched two scoreless innings in his spring training debut against Baltimore. He's allowed one run and six hits in 4 2-3 innings and has a 1.93 ERA.

''It was one of those days where mistakes were hit for base hits,'' Happ said. ''I also felt like I executed a lot of pitches.''

Manager John Gibbons likes what he's seen.

''I thought he threw the ball well, better than I've seen him in the past this early,'' Gibbons said. ''That's a good sign.''

Rays: Archer allowed two runs, three hits and two walks in 2 1-3 innings. He struck out three during the 50-pitch outing.

''It was a good work day,'' the right-hander, a first-time All-Star in 2015, said.

''My stuff was pretty close to mid-season form,'' Archer added, ''I think my fastball command was just a tick off in that first inning.''

TRAINER'S ROOM

Blue Jays: Right-hander Marco Estrada has been slowed by a sore back but is improving and possibly could make his exhibition debut late next week.

Rays: First baseman Steve Pearce was scratched from the lineup because of right calf tightness. The injury is not considered serious and he's day-to-day. Right-fielder Steven Souza Jr., limited by a left intercostal strain since the start of spring training, played in a game for the first time, going 0-for-3 with strikeouts in his first two at-bats.

Souza said he didn't experience any pain or setbacks.

''I just wanted to get in there and test it out in a high-adrenaline environment,'' the outfielder said. ''It's good to get past it and move on.''

TRANSACTION

The Rays optioned catching prospect Justin O'Connor to Triple-A Durham of the International League. He has been slowed in spring training by a back injury.

The Packers usually take a conservative approach to free agency, although they have made splashes in the past, such as when they signed Julius Peppers in 2014, although that came on the fourth day of free agency.

That doesn't mean Green Bay did nothing, however.

The NFL sends out a release of all available free agents. Missing from the list were linebacker Chris Banjo and tight end Justin Perillo, both of whom were exclusive rights free agents. This means the Packers tendered both players an offer.

Banjo played in all 16 games in 2015 with one start. He had 16 tackles (15 solo). In three seasons with the Packers, Banjo has 36 tackles and has played 35 games.

After playing in two games in 2014, Perillo appeared in nine contests last season, recording 11 catches for 102 yards with a touchdown. His standout game came against Detroit in Week 10 at Lambeau Field, when he had five receptions for 58 yards and a TD.

On the list, though, was linebacker Andy Mulumba, who was a restricted free agent. Mulumba can now sign with any team -- including Green Bay -- but the Packers will not have the right to match any offer, which they could have done if Mulumba had been tendered an offer of $1.671 million.

Mulumba appeared in just six games last season, recording four tackles. He played in 14 games with three starts as a rookie in 2013, but played in two games in 2014 before going on injured reserve with a knee injury.

Green Bay re-signed its other restricted free agent, offensive lineman Lane Taylor, earlier this week.

Here at the Packers players who are unrestricted free agents: tackle Don Barclay, long snapper Brett Goode, cornerback Casey Hayward, wide receiver James Jones, fullback John Kuhn, linebacker Mike Neal, linebacker Nick Perry, tight end Andrew Quarless, nose tackle B.J. Raji, safety Sean Richardson, running back James Starks and quarterback Scott Tolzien.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Bryce Harper says what baseball purists don't want to hear,[],"Baseball has become somewhat of a gentleman's sport over the years. Ostentatious celebrations and confident bat flips are criticized rather than celebrated, and players are largely expected to act like they've been there before. There is very little room for personality in the game today, and when players like Bryce Harper do show their swagger, they catch heat for their actions.

According to Harper, that criticism of individuality is exactly why baseball is becoming what he calls a ""tired sport."" In a recent interview with ESPN The Magazine, Harper explained why he thinks baseball's moral code actually hurts the game.

Via ESPN The Magazine:

""Baseball's tired,"" Harper said. ""It's a tired sport, because you can't express yourself. You can't do what people in other sports do. I'm not saying baseball is, you know, boring or anything like that, but it's the excitement of the young guys who are coming into the game now who have flair. If that's Matt Harvey or Jacob deGrom or Manny Machado or Joc Pederson or Andrew McCutchen or Yasiel Puig -- there's so many guys in the game now who are so much fun.



""... You want kids to play the game, right? What are kids playing these days? Football, basketball. Look at those players -- Steph Curry, LeBron James. It's exciting to see those players in those sports. Cam Newton -- I love the way Cam goes about it. He smiles, he laughs. It's that flair. The dramatic.""

Harper has a point. Baseball is a tough game to watch for an American public with an ever-decreasing attention span. Unlike other sports, there's no clock in baseball, and games can easily drag on hours longer than a football, basketball or hockey game. When there is no personality and nothing that makes a player or a team stand out among the monotony of balls and strikes, line drives and fly balls, it is easy to see why viewers might lose interest.

Beyond a great play in the field or a monster performance at bat, what really gets people talking these days are shareable moments from games, and oftentimes it takes personality to create those moments. That is not an idea baseball purists will be fond of -- in baseball, players are expected to be professional at all times. Any sign of individuality is a dark mark against a player rather than a positive attribute.

Morocco's Foreign Ministry has criticized Ban's trip in a statement, condemning the use of the term ""occupation"" in describing the territorial status of the Western Sahara.

The United Nations issued a response late Wednesday, saying Ban referred to the ""occupation"" of the territory because of ""the inability of Sahrawi refugees to return home under conditions that include satisfactory governance arrangements under which all Sahrawis can freely express their desires.""

During his weekend visit, Ban expressed frustration over dire living conditions in the camps and called for renewed peace talks for the Western Sahara, annexed by Morocco in 1975.

Ban has announced plans for a donors' conference to address the Morocco situation.

Morocco expressed ""regret"" over the plans to organize the donor's conference, and said past international aid has been unfairly spent. The government statement Tuesday also questioned why the U.N. chief didn't address concerns about rights violations in the Tindouf camps.

Ban also visited Algiers over the weekend, where he stated that there was ""no real progress"" in reaching a solution for the Western Sahara conflict.

While Ban's tour didn't take him to Morocco, the U.N. indicated there are plans for him to visit Morocco in the near future.

In multiple videos of the incident, Rakeem Jones, 26, is seen walking up the steps of the Fayetteville Crown Coliseum on his way out of the arena. At least two Cumberland County Sheriffs Department officers can be seen walking behind Jones as an unidentified Trump supporter with a pony tail and wearing a dark vest and cowboy hat moves to the end of one of the aisles and, with his right hand, socks Jones in the face.

Jones is briefly obscured by a crowd of people as he reaches the top of the stairs, but, the next moment, hes seen falling to the ground with a police officer on top of him. Three cops then restrain Jones for several seconds, flip him on to his stomach and then eventually lift him up and finish taking him out of the Coliseum.

The police jumped on me like I was the one swinging, Jones told The Washington Post. My eye still hurts. Its just shocking. The shock of it all is starting to set in. Its like this dude really hit me and they let him get away with it. I was basically in police custody and got hit.

But CCSO public information officer Sgt. Sean Swain disputed Jones version of events.

I couldnt see if officers took him to the ground, or if he fell to the ground. We havent talked to the officers at the top of the steps, Swain, who was at the rally, told FoxNews.com on Thursday. As I looked up, people would miss a step and theyd fall. Until we investigate it, we cant say our officers took him down to the ground. Now, we did pick him off the ground and escort him out.

[The video] only shows one perspective, he added.

A video posted by Ronnie C Rouse (@theronniec910) on Mar 9, 2016 at 8:03pm PST

Swain said police have launched an internal investigation into the incident and are also investigating the assault on Jones. Officials plan to interview Jones later on Thursday and were working to identify the man in the pony tail and cowboy hat, Swain said.

Asked why the man wasnt arrested on the spot, Swain said officers didnt see the encounter.

Both the officers are looking down [in the video] when the camera phone turns away when the guy punches, Swain said. If we had stayed and tried to reason things out right there it would have gotten very bad.

Swain said no one was arrested at the rally. However, he said Secret Service officials told him there were more protesters in Fayetteville than at any other Trump rally so far.

As people watch an eight second video and form their conclusions about what goes on, our mission that night  we have 14,000 people at the crown  was to keep everybody safe, Swain said. Our instruction was to separate people and get them out the door as quickly as possible before it escalates.

Ronnie Rouse, who was with Jones, told The Post that officers asked them to leave the rally almost as soon as Trump took the stage. Jones said someone in his group shouted something, prompting the ejection.

Now, Jones told The Post, the aftermath of the incident is adding insult to injury  in this case a swollen right cheek.

Boom, he caught me, Jones said. After I get it, before I could even gain my thoughts, Im on the ground getting escorted out. Now Im waking up this morning looking at the news and seeing me getting hit again.

But it's unclear when the full Senate will take up Fanning's nomination.

Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., last year placed a hold on his nomination to protest the Obama administration's efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility. Sarah Little, Roberts' spokeswoman, said the hold remains in place.

President Obama nominated Fanning to the post in September. The committee moved ahead with Fanning's nomination after the Defense Department delivered copies of work-related emails that Fanning and Defense Secretary Ash Carter exchanged over Carter's personal unsecured email account.

Fanning has held several jobs in the Pentagon. He served as the Army secretary's principal adviser on management and operation of the service, with a focus on the budget. He was undersecretary of the Air Force from April 2013 to February 2015, and for half a year was the acting secretary of the Air Force. He also worked on Carter's transition.

The committee met in January to consider Fanning's nomination shortly after he stepped down from the job in an acting capacity.

Committee members had expressed concern a federal law governing requirements for filling openings that require Senate confirmation would be violated if Fanning continued as acting secretary. The committee chairman, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, said Fanning's resignation ""cured"" the problem, but the committee adjourned without voting.

The committee's approval comes as the Obama administration works to eliminate barriers to military service based on sexuality or gender.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Video shows Google self-driving car hit bus,[],"Newly released video shows the moment a Google self-driving car learned the hard way not to tussle with a public bus.

The collision happened on Valentine's Day, when a Google vehicle struck the side of a public bus in the Silicon Valley city of Mountain View. Footage recorded by cameras on the bus shows a Lexus SUV, which Google has outfitted with sensors and cameras that let it drive itself, edging into the path of the bus that was rolling by at about 15 mph.

It was the first time in several years of testing on public roads that a Google self-driving car prototype caused a crash. Google has blamed other drivers for past collisions during testing, but, in a first, accepted at least partial responsibility for this crash.

The Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority released the video and post-crash photos this week to The Associated Press under a public records request.

Though it was a low-speed collision, the impact crumpled the Lexus' front left side, flattened the tire and tore off the radar Google installed to help the SUV perceive its surroundings.

The Lexus had to be towed. Neither the Google employee in the driver's seat  who must be there under California law to take the wheel in an emergency  nor the 16 people on the bus were injured.

The transit agency has concluded based on the footage that the bus driver was not responsible, spokeswoman Stacey Hendler Ross said. An independent claims adjustor has not yet determined liability, she said.

Here are a few other things to know about the crash and Google's self-driving cars:

___

IS THIS THE FIRST CRASH FOR A GOOGLE CAR?

No. The Feb. 14 crash is the first in which Google has acknowledged its car made a mistake that led to a collision.

Google has reported that between September 2014 and November, its prototypes drove themselves about 400,000 miles on city streets near its Silicon Valley headquarters without causing a collision.

Its fleet has likely driven an additional 100,000 miles since then, though the company won't be specific. According to Google's accounting, its cars have been hit nearly a dozen times on the streets in or around its Mountain View headquarters since road testing began in spring 2014.

___

HOW DID THE CRASH HAPPEN?

The Lexus intended to turn right off a major boulevard but stopped after detecting sandbags around a storm drain near the intersection, according to an accident report Google filed with the California Department of Motor Vehicles.

Photos show two small, black sandbags on either side of a drain at the curb. The right lane was wide enough to let some cars turn and others go straight, but to avoid driving over the sandbags, the Lexus needed to slide to its left within the lane. The bus and several other cars that drove straight were to the left of the Lexus, in the same lane.

When the light turned green, several cars ahead of the bus passed the SUV. Google has said that both the car's software and the person in the driver's seat thought the bus would let the Lexus into the flow of traffic. The Google employee did not try to intervene before the crash.

""This is a classic example of the negotiation that's a normal part of driving  we're all trying to predict each other's movements. In this case, we clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved there wouldn't have been a collision,"" Google wrote of the incident.

___

WHAT DOES THE VIDEO SHOW?

The footage shows angles from eight onboard cameras.

In one clip, passengers gazing out on a sunny afternoon are jolted to attention by a scraping, crunching sound and the impact, which causes several hand straps to sway.

In another clip, the Lexus RX450 can be seen bouncing off the side of the bus. Photos show a long scratch mark traversing the side of the bus. The car's radar unit ended up wedged in the crack where two side passenger doors of the bus join, cracking a glass panel.

A camera trained on the driver shows him open his mouth in surprise, then gesture as if to say, ""Why did you just hit my bus?""

Damage to the bus was between $2,000 and $3,000, the transit agency said Wednesday. Google would not disclose the cost to fix its car.

___

SURPRISING MOVE

Google has said that safety is its guiding principle in developing the cars, and that once mature, the technology promises to reduce collisions and deaths dramatically.

The software that controls the cars is programmed to follow all traffic laws and to drive conservatively, the company said.

The law-abiding algorithms that rule the SUV's onboard computer make its decision to try and slip in front of the bus surprising.

Footage shows there was not much more than a full car length between the bus and the GMC Yukon in front of it.

Google said it has tweaked its software to ""more deeply understand that buses and other large vehicles are less likely to yield to us than other types of vehicles.""",[]

She had used the skyway to pass the Target Center, home of the Timberwolves, and past the teams offices. While efforts to find Hammy fell short, the Wolves invited Kiresuk and her family to a March 8 matchup against the San Antonio Spurs at Target Center.

After a couple of days went by and Hammy hadnt been found, we decided to reach out and see if we could do something, not to replace Hammy  Hammy can never be replaced, but try to do something [to make it] a little less traumatizing for the family, Brad Ruiter, Timberwolves spokesman told Fox 9.

At the game Timberwolves guard Tyus Jones presented Kiresuk with a new companion, a stuffed dog which she named Wiggy after star player Andrew Wiggins.

Its nice to have moments where you dont remember youre sick, she told the news station.

While there is no cure for her disorder, the family is hopeful that a bone marrow transplant will allow Kiresuk to live a fuller life. They are currently fundraising to help cover costs.",[]

Colleton County Lt. Shane Roberts said the youngsters were found after a search in near Interstate 95, about 60 miles northwest of Charleston.

About 40 law deputies and other law enforcement officers had searched for the children, ages 2, 3 and 4, who were reported missing after playing outside in their yard late Wednesday afternoon.

The missing youngsters were identified as 4-year-old Mya Campbell and her 2-year-old sister Shamyra Campbell, and 3-year-old Eugene McTeer, their cousin.

Family and neighbors had searched for about 20 minutes before calling 911. The search continued until about 2 a.m. Thursday and then resumed about five hours later.

An airplane and helicopter were used in the search, and Wildlife Department workers could be seen riding all-terrain vehicles along a road Thursday morning. The media was being kept about a mile from the cluster of homes near a sheriff's department command post.

Some relatives had told local media they were concerned the youngsters might have been abducted.

""The initial statements we got on scene were that it was a case of wandering,"" Roberts said. Later, when family members mentioned a possible abduction ""we deployed resources to try to follow that up as well,"" Roberts said. ""There is nothing at this point to indicate they have been abducted.""

He said the terrain hampered the search.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Assault at Trump rally raises questions about police response,['Cody Derespina'],"A black protester being escorted out of a Donald Trump rally in North Carolina by police on Wednesday was punched in the face by a white Trump supporter  yet no arrests were made and the only person restrained and ejected was the man who was punched.

In multiple videos of the incident, Rakeem Jones, 26, is seen walking up the steps of the Fayetteville Crown Coliseum on his way out of the arena. At least two Cumberland County Sheriffs Department officers can be seen walking behind Jones as an unidentified Trump supporter with a pony tail and wearing a dark vest and cowboy hat moves to the end of one of the aisles and, with his right hand, socks Jones in the face.

Jones is briefly obscured by a crowd of people as he reaches the top of the stairs, but, the next moment, hes seen falling to the ground with a police officer on top of him. Three cops then restrain Jones for several seconds, flip him on to his stomach and then eventually lift him up and finish taking him out of the Coliseum.

The police jumped on me like I was the one swinging, Jones told The Washington Post. My eye still hurts. Its just shocking. The shock of it all is starting to set in. Its like this dude really hit me and they let him get away with it. I was basically in police custody and got hit.

But CCSO public information officer Sgt. Sean Swain disputed Jones version of events.

I couldnt see if officers took him to the ground, or if he fell to the ground. We havent talked to the officers at the top of the steps, Swain, who was at the rally, told FoxNews.com on Thursday. As I looked up, people would miss a step and theyd fall. Until we investigate it, we cant say our officers took him down to the ground. Now, we did pick him off the ground and escort him out.

[The video] only shows one perspective, he added.

A video posted by Ronnie C Rouse (@theronniec910) on Mar 9, 2016 at 8:03pm PST

Swain said police have launched an internal investigation into the incident and are also investigating the assault on Jones. Officials plan to interview Jones later on Thursday and were working to identify the man in the pony tail and cowboy hat, Swain said.

Asked why the man wasnt arrested on the spot, Swain said officers didnt see the encounter.

Both the officers are looking down [in the video] when the camera phone turns away when the guy punches, Swain said. If we had stayed and tried to reason things out right there it would have gotten very bad.

Swain said no one was arrested at the rally. However, he said Secret Service officials told him there were more protesters in Fayetteville than at any other Trump rally so far.

As people watch an eight second video and form their conclusions about what goes on, our mission that night  we have 14,000 people at the crown  was to keep everybody safe, Swain said. Our instruction was to separate people and get them out the door as quickly as possible before it escalates.

Ronnie Rouse, who was with Jones, told The Post that officers asked them to leave the rally almost as soon as Trump took the stage. Jones said someone in his group shouted something, prompting the ejection.

Now, Jones told The Post, the aftermath of the incident is adding insult to injury  in this case a swollen right cheek.

Boom, he caught me, Jones said. After I get it, before I could even gain my thoughts, Im on the ground getting escorted out. Now Im waking up this morning looking at the news and seeing me getting hit again.

Violent encounters have become a normal part of Trump events as the businessmans campaign for the Republican nomination has progressed.

During a March 4 rally in Warren, Mich., Trump called for a protester to be ejected, according to the Associated Press.

Try not to hurt him, Trump said. If you do, Ill defend you in court.

Trump later recalled a fight during a New Hampshire rally, saying: It was really amazing to watch.

During a November event, a Black Lives Matter activist was pushed and shoved as he was removed.

Maybe he should have been roughed up, Trump later said on Fox News.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Years of taking popular diabetes drug tied to risk of B12 deficiency,[],"People taking metformin, a common type 2 diabetes medication, for several years may be at heightened risk of vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia, according to a new analysis of long-term data.

Metformin helps to control the amount of sugar, or glucose, in the blood by reducing how much glucose is absorbed from food and produced by the liver, and by increasing the body's response to the hormone insulin, according to the National Institutes of Health.

""Metformin is the most commonly used drug to treat type 2 diabetes, so many millions of people are taking it, usually for a prolonged period (many years),"" said senior study author Dr. Jill P Crandall of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, by email.

""Smaller numbers of people take metformin for prevention of diabetes or treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome,"" Crandall told Reuters Health.

The researchers used data from the Diabetes Prevention Program and the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study, which followed participants at high risk for type 2 diabetes for more than 10 years.

The study began with more than 3,000 people age 25 years and older with high blood sugar. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either 850 milligrams of metformin twice daily, placebo medication or an intensive lifestyle program than did not include medication. For the new analysis only those taking placebo or metformin were considered, and about 50 participants were excluded after having weight-loss surgery, which would affect their diabetes outcomes.

During follow-up, the participants provided blood samples at the five- and 13-year points.

Using these blood samples, the researchers found that at year five, average B12 levels were lower in the metformin group than the placebo group, and B12 deficiency was more common, affecting 4 percent of those on metformin compared to 2 percent of those not taking the drug.

Borderline low B12 levels affected almost 20 percent of those on metformin and 10 percent of those taking placebo.

Average vitamin B12 levels were higher by year 13 than in year five, but B12 deficiency was also more common in both the metformin and placebo groups, as reported in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.

Vitamin B12 deficiency may lead to nerve damage which can be severe and may be irreversible, Crandall said.

""Severe and prolonged B12 deficiency has also been linked to impaired cognition and dementia,"" she said. ""It can also cause anemia (low red blood cell count) - fortunately, this condition is reversible with treatment.""

More people in the metformin group were also anemic at year five than in the placebo group.

There are more than three million cases of vitamin B12 deficiency each year in the U.S., which can be caused by diet or certain medical conditions. Symptoms include fatigue, and numbness or tingling.

Humans do not make vitamin B12 and need to consume it from animal sources or supplements. Vegetarians may get enough from eating eggs and dairy products, but vegans need to rely on supplements or fortified grains.

Doctors who prescribe metformin to patients long-term for type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome or other indications should consider routine measurement of vitamin B12 levels, the authors conclude.

""The FDA and organizations such as the American Diabetes Association do not have any formal recommendations for B12 monitoring for people taking metformin,"" Crandall said. ""That said, our study (and others) suggests that a small but significant number of people may develop deficiency.""

""People who are taking metformin should ask their doctor about measuring their B12 level,"" she said.

Restoring healthy B12 levels is easy to accomplish with pills or monthly injections, she added.

""The risk of B12 deficiency should not be considered a reason to avoid taking metformin,"" Crandall said.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Cruz says Trump backers have 'relatively low information,' not very 'engaged'",[],"Ted Cruz said in an interview ahead of next weeks critical primaries that Donald Trumps supporters have relatively low information and are not that engaged  an oblique dig at the very voters Cruz is aggressively courting.

The Texas senator, though, said in the interview with CBN News that hes winning over these voters as they inform themselves and learn more about Trumps record. Explaining his comments, he referred to Trumps past remarks about the poorly educated supporting him.

Donald does well with voters who have relatively low information, who are not that engaged and who are angry and they see him as an angry voice, Cruz told CBN. Where we are beating him is when voters get more engaged and they get more informed. When they inform themselves, they realize his record. Hes what theyre angry at. He is the corruption, and if you want someone to stand up to Washington, the only one who has been doing so in this race is me.

Donald does well with voters who have relatively low information, who are not that engaged and who are angry and they see him as an angry voice. - GOP presidential contender Ted Cruz

Cruz also said Trump is taking advantage of his voters  which is roughly the same charge the GOP front-runner leveled at his Republican detractors during a Fox News town hall Wednesday night.

At the forum, Trump pushed back against what appears to be a growing movement among the party establishment  including a few of his former rivals  to at least slow march to the convention with enough delegates in hand to claim the nomination.

The billionaire businessman called his campaign a movement ""of competence and common sense and low taxes and [secure] borders and it would be so foolish to give it away.""

Trump was referring to a conference held by the conservative American Enterprise Institute at Sea Island off the coast of Georgia over the weekend, where one of the topics reportedly was stopping Trump from securing the Republican nomination.

The conference reportedly was attended by Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other key Republican congressmen.

""I know all these people,"" Trump told Fox News Sean Hannity. ""These are people that are taking advantage of our country. They dont want to have strong borders. They want stuff flowing across the borders. They dont want to have taxation when countries treat us unfairly because they benefit from that.""

Cruzs comments about Trumps supporters comes ahead of another Republican debate Thursday night in Florida, the site of one of five big primaries next Tuesday. The stakes are higher than ever, as those five primaries could decide the fate of Trumps remaining rivals.

As Trump builds his delegate lead over the field following a string of wins earlier this week, Cruz is positioning himself as the one candidate who could actually beat Trump in the end  citing several primary and caucus victories, most recently in Idaho.

He was buoyed Wednesday by the endorsement of former candidate Carly Fiorina. And, speaking with Fox News Megyn Kelly, he said the other two candidates in the race  Marco Rubio and John Kasich  do not have a path to the nomination.

""Head-to-head, not only do I beat Donald Trump,"" Cruz said, ""but I defeat him resoundingly.""

Rubio is under tremendous pressure to win Florida next week, his home state. But a Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Rubio trailing Trump by 23 percentage points among likely Republican voters in Florida.

Rubio, though, told Kelly he has no intention of dropping out right now.

""I have never discussed dropping out with anyone on my team, or anyone on the planet Earth ... I'm the only one who can beat Donald Trump in Florida, he said.

Rubio also dismissed the possibility that he would form a so-called ""unity"" Republican ticket with Cruz, Trump's closest challenger in the delegate race, calling it "" the kind of drama that makes it interesting in TV to speculate about.""

""At some point we're all going to team up,"" Rubio said in reference to the non-Trump candidates. ""We're all going to be on the same team, I hope.

Former GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush also planned to meet with Trump's rivals on Thursday ahead of the GOP debate in Florida, fueling speculation that he's preparing to endorse a candidate challenging Trump.

Ohio Gov. Kasich, meanwhile, is vowing to win his home state next week. He told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren that he would ""probably not"" pick up enough delegates in other contests to overtake Trump, but noted that voters had only ""picked about half the delegates [so far] this year ... anything is possible.""

A Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Kasich leading Trump by five percentage points among likely Republican voters in the Buckeye State.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Iraq's military falls short on logistics in fight against IS,[],"Iraq's military is once again trying to dislodge Islamic State group fighters from the vast Samarra desert, which stretches between newly recaptured territory in Anbar province and the IS-held northern city of Mosul. Yet, as operations move further away from the capital, government forces are increasingly plagued by logistical shortcomings.

Iraq's minister of defense Khalid al-Obeidi on Wednesday toured Camp Speicher, a military base 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of the capital, Baghdad. Surrounded by a crowd of assistants and military officials, he carefully asked commanders about food supplies, weapons deliveries and training.

""He's very detail-oriented, during the previous administration the Iraqi military had a lot of issues with troops not being fed, in addition to, you know, the larger payroll issues,"" said an official from the minister's office.

He was referring euphemistically to the entrenched corruption in the Iraqi military, which was exposed in the summer of 2014 when the army all but collapsed and Islamic State group fighters captured Mosul. In addition to the tens of thousands of troops who fled in the face of the IS assault, more than 50,000 troops were later revealed to be ghost soldiers  nonexistent troops whose pay was pocketed by senior commanders.

The ministry of defense official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the press.

Following millions of dollars of investment, Iraq's military is being tested once more. Earlier this month, Iraqi troops pushed to retake territory northwest of Samarra, 60 miles (95 kilometers) from Baghdad, and cut IS supply lines in advance of an eventual push on Mosul. Iraqi officials say the fight was led by the Popular Mobilization Forces, the government-sanctioned coalition of mostly Shiite militia groups  who have proved to be one of the most effective fighting forces on the ground  but also involved the Iraqi military. The ground troops were backed by both coalition and Iraqi air strikes.

Past attempts to retake the same area have failed, partly because the open terrain left Iraqi troops increasingly vulnerable to IS counter-attacks as they advanced.

The Samarra operation is intended to build on gains in the west of the country. Last month, Iraqi and coalition forces declared the western city of Ramadi fully-liberated. Afterward, Iraqi forces continued to clear villages in the area, most recently Zangura and Qariya Asriya northwest of the provincial capital. Iraqi forces this week evacuated more than a thousand people from the two villages being held as hostages by IS.

Defense Minister Khalid al-Obeidi took office just over a year ago in the wake of Mosul's fall. Since then, a U.S.-led coalition has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on training and equipment for Iraq's military. Yet, despite putting more than 18,500 troops through training, few of these troops are on the front lines. Previous victories have been led by Shiite militia forces or Iraq's elite counterterrorism forces.

At Camp Speicher troops greeted al-Obeidi in tight formations on the tarmac, wearing neat uniforms. Yet as the minister's convoy headed toward front lines in the Samarra desert, the order broke down.

At checkpoints along the road that runs north to Bayji  and onwards in the direction of Mosul  Shiite flags began to outnumber Iraqi national ones. Beyond Bayji, there were no more Iraqi military forces to be seen.

Along the Samarra desert frontline members of the Popular Mobilization Forces  young men in sandals, mismatched tee-shirts and fatigues  were the ones holding the hard-fought recent gains. Their simple posts were marked with boxes of bottled water, tents and portable toilets.

Standing at a frontline position just 9 miles (15 kilometers) from Islamic State group positions, al-Obeidi praised the ""cooperation"" between Iraq's military and the Shiite militia forces.

""These battles have shown high coordination between the armed forces and their professionalism,"" he said, looking out toward the horizon through binoculars. But even the visit was plagued with the logistical failings that often hamper the Iraqi army on the battlefield: one vehicle broke down and two Hummers in the minister's convoy ran out of petrol midway.

Unlike operations focused on cities, Iraqi military operations in the desert require lengthy, secure supply lines to transport food, weapons and fuel to the front.

In the Samarra desert, the trucks moving to and from Camp Speicher belonged to Shiite militia forces and bore pictures of Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Historically, Iraq's military were ""very talented logisticians,"" said Michael Knights, an Iraq military analyst and fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. But the U.S.-led invasion and the subsequent dissolution of the country's military changed that. ""We brought in a new over-complex, over-computerized system and they never recovered,"" Knights said.

As operations move forward, coalition officials and analysts agree logistics will become increasingly important for any eventual push on Mosul.

""The operation at Mosul, like Ramadi before it, will chew up thousands of tons of ammunition and will require tens of thousands of troops to live at considerable distance from their home bases for months on end,"" Knights said.

The U.S.-led coalition agreed that supplying the front with ammunition and food will continue to be a ""challenge"" for the Iraqi military, but spokesman Col. Steve Warren said he's confident coalition advisers and training will be able to bridge the current gaps.

As the minister's convoy pulled away from the Samarra desert front and back to the base, the helicopters left with them, as did the dozens of defense ministry troops.

""It's not time for us to be out on the front lines,"" said Corporal Ahmed Saher, with the military's SWAT team, during the drive back to the base.

His unit was stationed in Tikrit but withdrew when the city was overrun by IS in 2014. They are now living at Camp Speicher, but have not returned to the front line. ""The decision to deploy is not ours,"" he said.

The 15-year-old took his own life on Dec. 8 after his parents found out the school wasn't going to give their son the letter of recommendation he needed to take the entrance exam for his high school of choice.

The school, located in the town of Fuchu, wouldn't pen the letter because the teen's file noted he had been busted for shoplifting during his first year at the schooleven though it turned out it had been a different student who committed the crime.

""Our child would never have taken his life if the school's data management had not been sloppy,"" a statement from the boy's family read.

What's said to have happened: The teacher who entered the shoplifting charge into the school's records was basing the entry on a verbal report from another faculty member and plugged in the wrong name.

The mistake was discovered in October 2013, but while the error was fixed on paper, it remained in the school's electronic records. The school's in-house probe found the school was to blame for the boy's death due to ""poor clerical management and career guidance,"" per Kyodo News.

The ""career guidance"" portion relates to the boy's homeroom teacher, who spoke with him five times about progressing to high school, reports the Mainichi.

Those sessions consisted of five-minute interactions in the school hallway. Principal Hiroshi Sakamoto also apologized for initially saying the boy had died of heart failure. (This typo thwarted a $1 billion bank heist.)

The songstress's career spans six decades, and has made Parton an American icon.

That's why when the singer announced she'd be embarking on her first North American tour in 25 years, fans rejoiced. The Tennessee native is bringing her ""Pure & Simple"" tour to 60 cities in 2016.

""I've been very blessed through the years and I've been doing tours in Australia and in Europe for the last few years,"" Parton told FOX411 Country. ""But I hadn't had any big hit records in the United States in a long time. I've got a lot of history, a lot of records that have been big hits in the past but I just didn't think anybody would be interested in seeing me in concert with all the new country people and all, but evidentially they are interested.""

Parton's modesty aside, American listeners are still big fans of the 70-year-old. Her last album, ""Blue Smoke,"" released in 2014 was Parton's highest-charting solo album ever. At 37,000 copies sold in its first week, it was her best sales week for a solo endeavor.

Despite her continuing success, Parton is unsure why she is still on top.

""Well, I think there's a lot of great artists and there are people that really have that staying power...that really do draw crowds if they go out,"" she said of her fellow country artists like Reba and Hank Williams Jr. ""But I feel like I'm older than all of them and I think but I've been at it longer than all of them as well, but I just think that it's wonderful that we can all be loved and accepted...but the fact that a lot of the new people are recognize my music really makes me feel good. Makes me feel old but makes me feel good.""

Following in the longstanding tradition of storytelling that country music is known for, Parton has proudly most of her own hits and a few for others (Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" is a Dolly original.)

However, a lot of today's artists are no longer writing their own songs and Nashville's songwriters are not seeing their ""just dues,"" Parton said.

""I do think a song is the most important thing,"" the ""Jolene"" singer said. ""A songwriter is the most important person in the business because without the song, nobody has a career because you don't have hits unless you have a hit song. So I really think songwriters are not

getting their just dues anymore and even their just monies anymore.

""I've been blessed that I've been able to write and I have written the biggest part of my hits through the years...but a lot of artists, a lot of singers don't write at all...I think a songwriter is very important and that to me, is my favorite thing that I do.""

That's not to say that the skill of songwriting is lost in country music today.

""Well there are a lot of great artists out there that really do write...like Keith Urban, he writes a lot of wonderful things of his own. Brad Paisley, great, great writer,"" Parton praised. ""I'm very proud of the singers that also can write. And Taylor, Taylor Swift, she's a great one for sure.""

Looking back on her long career, Parton reflected on what advice she would give herself when she first started out.

""Oh I don't know I'd give myself any advice. I would just say, 'You better brace yourself because we're in for the ride of our lives, and it's been a good one.""

Hannah Kiresuk, 19, was diagnosed with juvenile refractory myasthenia gravis, a rare autoimmune disorder that has no cure. Shes undergone more than 30 surgeries and procedures, countless rounds of chemotherapy and has spent hundreds of long nights in the hospital. Through it all, her stuffed animal Hammy has been with her.

Hes been there for 300 nights in the hospital, almost two years of chemotherapy, 30-plus surgeries, Kiresuk told Fox 9. The toy had bandages, zip up sutures and medical tubes to represent each of Kiresuks procedure.

The cow toy went missing after it fell out of Kiresuks backpack in early March while she was attending a benefit held in her honor in Minneapolis, Fox 9 reported. She had used the skyway to pass the Target Center, home of the Timberwolves, and past the teams offices. While efforts to find Hammy fell short, the Wolves invited Kiresuk and her family to a March 8 matchup against the San Antonio Spurs at Target Center.

After a couple of days went by and Hammy hadnt been found, we decided to reach out and see if we could do something, not to replace Hammy  Hammy can never be replaced, but try to do something [to make it] a little less traumatizing for the family, Brad Ruiter, Timberwolves spokesman told Fox 9.

At the game Timberwolves guard Tyus Jones presented Kiresuk with a new companion, a stuffed dog which she named Wiggy after star player Andrew Wiggins.

Its nice to have moments where you dont remember youre sick, she told the news station.

While there is no cure for her disorder, the family is hopeful that a bone marrow transplant will allow Kiresuk to live a fuller life. They are currently fundraising to help cover costs.",[]

In the time between Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzmans escape from prison in July 2015 and the six months he was on the run before his recapture on Jan. 8, the notorious drug lord had a furtive meeting with two American actors, and the Mexican government was humiliated.

An unidentified source told the New York Post's Page Six that the Mexicans sought a swap. They wanted the U.S. to turn over the famous telenovela and movie actress Kate del Castillo in exchange for the infamous Sinaloa Cartel leader.

The Mexican government was embarrassed that [it] had told the U.S. authorities they didnt know where El Chapo was,"" the source said. ""Then two actors from Hollywood were able to find him. After the Rolling Stone piece came out, they wanted to swap El Chapo for Kate. They wanted to embarrass her.

Del Castillo has been battling legal troubles since the secret meeting with the drug lord and actor Sean Penn. Mexican authorities are investigating the actress, who was born in Mexico and became a naturalized U.S. citizen last year, looking into the possibility that she laundered money for the cartel in her endeavors to make a film about Guzman and produce a tequila.

Her attorney, Harland Braun, has said the allegations are unfounded.

According to a documentary airing on Reelz Thursday night, ""El Chapo and Sean Penn: Bungle in the Jungle,"" the actor and two film producers, Fernando Sulichin and Jose Ibanez who attended the meeting in Mexico, were working with director Oliver Stone to acquire the rights to a movie about the kingpin.

The Hollywood Reporter recently reported that Stone denied involvement, and that Penn signed an agreement with Sulichin, Ibanez and del Castillo, giving up any rights to a film project.

In Penns article about meeting Guzman, published in Rolling Stone magazine in January, he did not name the two producers instead using the pseudonyms Espinoza and ""El Alto"" Garcia.

Follow on Twitter, Facebook, listen free/live on foxnewsradio app

For the sake of argument, lets assumefor the momentthat Donald Trump becomes the Republican nominee.

What this means is November, 2016, will be the third Presidential election in a row thats about race.

Obama had two race elections, mobilizing black voters to put the first black President in office, and to make sure he wasnt fired when he was up for re-election.

This time it will be the brown vote (Latinos, and I suppose to some degree, Muslims) who are gearing up big time to stop Trump from becoming President.

The New York Times is reporting a massive citizenship drive among Latinos eligible to apply for citizenship but havent had any reason to rouse themselves to do so until Trump came along. Of course, the point is to be eligible to vote by November.

Besides those potential new voters (potential because one supposes it is at least theoretically possible a Latino applicant could fail to study civics and blow the test, but lets be serious, probably not with Obama judges teed up to rush them through), a huge drive is on to register Latino citizens, all with the aim of coming out to vote against Trump.

And the NYT also reports the wave of Latino voters will jump 17% over 2012.

And Trumpsters, beware, these numbers of Latino voters who could be coming out to slap down Donald Trump are fairly daunting.

On the other hand there is some other news floating around that may motivate Trumps side of the equationthe not brown voters. The Trump phenomena has caused some notice to the angry white men vote, who feel they have been forgotten in the economy and are alarmed at what is happening with the demographics of the country, which is to say the Presidents efforts to fundamentally transform America. By the way, some of these particular voters are presently supporting Bernie Sanders, but may have reason to come over to Trump.

In addition, new numbers on immigrants in the country show the number of illegals has jumped from 12 million to almost 16 million. Not to mention the fact that immigrants now comprise roughly 20%at leastof the total population.

Plus Trump voters might take note of the Democratic debate last night in which both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders promised to end deportations.

Hillary even startled everyone who pays attention to the debate of Trumps wall when she saidparaphrasing hey, weve already secured the border, lets move on to immigration (amnesty)!.

And both Hillary and Bernie competed to show voters who could declare Donald Trump the biggest racist.

Trump keeps saying he loves Hispanics. He probably needs to say it louder, or make sure his voters hear loud and clear that the other side thinks they are the racists.

This is going to be a campaign explicitly organizing Hispanic/Latino voters against what they see as the rise of white backlash in the form of Donald Trump.

This will be an election that shows in definitive terms whether or not the country has becomeas long predicted a non-white nation.

Trump can claim he is a unifier, but it appears this election is actually going to be hugely divisive, and worse, on racial lines.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Many hormone doctors feel uncomfortable with transgender patients,[],"People who are transgender may have difficulty finding endocrinologists who feel comfortable and competent in providing needed care, according to a new survey of physicians.

Endocrinologists are often key healthcare providers for people who are transgender. They specialize in the endocrine system, which regulates the body's hormones, and they may prescribe sex hormones like testosterone and estrogen to help transgender patients develop the physical characteristics tied to their gender identity.

But about a third of endocrinologists are unwilling to care for patients who are transgender, and less than half say they feel at least somewhat competent in providing that care, said Dr. Michael Irwig, who surveyed the doctors at an endocrinology meeting last year.

""There is still a big access problem,"" said Irwig, associate professor of medicine at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences in Washington, D.C. ""The fact that 30 percent won't see transgender patients wouldn't happen with any other diagnosis.""

""Basically, nobody had really done a similar survey before,"" said Irwig, who is also director of the Andrology Center at GW Medical Faculty Associates.

He asked 80 endocrinology providers from Delaware, Maryland, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington, D.C. to answer a 19-item survey. About 80 percent answered the survey.

Overall, 15 percent said they were not at all comfortable discussing gender identity, and another 34 percent said they were only slightly comfortable discussing the subject.

Fifty-eight percent reported being less comfortable with transgender patients than with non-transgender patients.

Fellowship training on transgender care was uncommon, reported by less than one-third of the doctors overall and by 58 percent of those ages 25 to 39.

Only 41 percent of participants felt at least somewhat competent in providing care to transgender people.

And only 63 percent said transgender patients could be seen at their practice. Irwig said he asked participants to explain why such patients couldn't be seen, ""but a lot of them didn't fill in that open-ended question.""

He told Reuters Health there could be a number of reasons for doctors refusing to see transgender patients, including prejudice, lack of understanding and not feeling competent in providing the needed care.

More training and experience may help improve healthcare access, said Irwig.

The Endocrine Society is updating its 2009 guidelines for caring for people who are transgender. The guidelines provide guidance and legitimacy, said Dr. Josh Safer, who is working on the update.

""The guidelines are an evidence-based, thoughtful approach from the ultimate mainstream endocrinology professional society and that is very strong for those needing reliable sources,"" said Safer, of the Boston University School of Medicine, in an email to Reuters Health.

The updated guidelines include changes to terminology, new practices on how to care for transgender adolescents and how transgender care fits within the larger medical community, he added in a phone interview.

Irwig said transgender people likely know healthcare access is an issue. To find endocrinologists who can provide culturally competent care, he suggests that patients calling doctors' offices ""ask their staff how many transgender patients are seen in the practice, because that will give them a good idea.""

Safer said he considers it a priority to train endocrinologists in transgender medical care. He is educating his own trainees on the subject.

""However, this is a long process,"" he said.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Large Hadron Collider results may hint at a new era of physics,['James Rogers'],"Are we about to enter a new era of physics? Data collected by the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland may have identified particle activity that doesnt fit the standard laws of physics.

The analysis by scientists including physicists at the Institute of Nuclear Physics at the Polish Academy of Sciences (IFJ PAN) could have huge scientific implications.

There are some indications that physicists working at the LHC accelerator at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva may see the first traces of physics beyond the current theory which describes the structure of matter, said the IFJ PAN, in a recent press release.

The structure of matter is described by a theoretical framework called The Standard Model, which identifies the roles played by different particles. Boson particles, for example, are carriers of forces, whereas photons are related to electromagnetic interactions. Matter is formed by particles called fermions.

However, scientists, analyzing data collected by the LHCb experiment in 2011 and 2012, noticed an anomaly in the decay of a particle called a B Meson. According to the research, the traditional method for determining the particles decay may lead to false results.

Related: Science breakthrough? Physicists may have discovered Higgs boson relative



Could the anomaly hint at a new understanding of the Universe? Scientists are certainly intrigued by the anomaly. To put it in terms of the cinema, where we once only had a few leaked scenes from an much-anticipated blockbuster, the LHC has finally treated fans to the first real trailer,"" said Professor Mariusz Witek of IFJ PAN, in the release.

Witek notes that the framework used to describe the structure of matter poses plenty of questions for scientists. The Standard Model cannot explain all the features of the Universe, he said. It doesnt predict the masses of particles or tell us why fermions are organized in three families. How did the dominance of matter over antimatter in the universe come about? What is dark matter? Those questions remain unanswered.

To further illustrate his point, the Professor notes that gravity isnt even included in the Standard Model.

However, scientists caution that more research is needed on the B Meson anomaly. We cant call it a discovery. Not yet, said the IFJ PAN.

CERN spokesman Arnaud Marsollier told FoxNews.com that the B Meson data, which first emerged last year, are not conclusive. More data are needed before we can tell anything significant on this, so we will have to wait for the LHC to restart (soon), he explained via email, noting the importance of patience when recording and analyzing data. Science needs time! he added.

Related: Revamped Large Hadron Collider set to restart

CERN is currently starting powering tests on the huge particle accelerator. Beams should be back by the end of the month or early April, and collisions sometimes next month if everything goes as planned, said Marsollier.

Oxford University Physics Professor Guy Wilkinson, who serves as the spokesman for the LHCb experiment, told FoxNews.com that CERNs B Meson data is extremely interesting, but noted that it could be a couple of years before scientists perform a full analysis. When we analyse this new sample in a year or two we will be able to make a fresh and, I hope, more categorical statement on this topic, he explained, via email.

The 17-mile LHC was built between 1998 and 2008 to help scientists test some theories of particle and high-energy physics and advance understanding of physical laws.

In 2012 the Collider won global acclaim with the discovery of the long-sought Higgs boson particle, which explains the behavior of other particles. Physicists Peter Higgs and Francois Englert were subsequently awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics.

So writes a group of 31 international scientists and clinicians in an editorial in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, stating that ""substantial published evidence"" suggests such a link and calling on researchers elsewhere to take action.

They claim that some microbesthe virus and two types of bacteria, chlamydia and spirocheteare linked to the progressive neurological disease. ""We are saying there is incontrovertible evidence that Alzheimer's disease has a dormant microbial component,"" writes lead author Douglas Kell in a University of Manchester statement.

""We can't keep ignoring all of the evidence."" The authors propose that the named microbes ""reach the [central nervous system] and remain there in latent form."" They can then essentially wake up during the course of aging, under stress, or as the immune system declines.

""The consequent neuronal damage ... occurs recurrently, leading to ... ultimately AD,"" the authors posit. They point to the failure of 413 Alzheimer's drug trials conducted between 2002 and 2012 and ""express our concern that one particular aspect of the disease has been neglected,"" as ""antiviral/antimicrobial treatment of AD patients ... could rectify the 'no drug works' impasse.""

If John F. Kennedy were alive today, he would have looked at the state of the Hispanic community and concluded that it was time to put more focus on education.

History has shown us that federal programs have never yielded the promised results regarding social inadequacies. But we must not sit with folded arms. - Daniel Garza

The numbers are disturbing: 27 percent of the 48.2 million people in poverty in the United States are of Hispanic origin. A Latino man is four times more likely to be incarcerated in a prison some time in his life than the rest of society. The poverty rate for Latinos was 24 percent in 2014. And the income of Latinos in 2014 was $42,396 per family compared to $53,482 for the general population.

These figures are alarming. My situation was not unlike many young Latinos of my time. The needs of our poor family  working on farms and agricultural fields  made me miss many days of school. This, and the indifference of the administrators, forced me to abandon my studies after the tenth grade, before obtaining a diploma. At the age of 17, I was a high school dropout.

My decision (the same as more than 10 percent of Latinos take each year) would have probably made me one of those statistics. Fortunately, I had an uncle who lent me a hand, encouraged me to take the GED exam, and even offered to pay.

This radically changed the course of my life. I went to college, worked in law enforcement, was elected to the City Council of my city, worked for my local congressman, and eventually served in the George W. Bush administration at the White House.

Certainly, this transformation would have been impossible if I had not achieved the equivalent of a secondary education. I could see through my experience that the United States remained a country where anyone  regardless of where they come from  can achieve what they want.

And if we want to change the realities that face our children and youth, we need to drive a change that strengthens the well-being and preparation of people. The interests and priorities of government bureaucrats and union machines seek  should make way for the good of the community.

Effective reforms should include measures to ensure opportunity for Latinos  as well as all other communities  to choose the educational institution that best suits their needs. States should take the lead in determining which institutions they accredit and certify courses for academic study. And policymakers must open the education market to encourage innovation and better outcomes for students.

Unfortunately these reforms have not arrived and today many are in the same situation I was at 17 years old. Currently, 31 percent of all Hispanics 18 and older lack a high school diploma or an equivalent credential.

This is a major obstacle to opportunity and a path to becoming one more number in the statistics mentioned above. That is why my organization, The LIBRE Institute, partnered with Essential Education to provide adults a free nationally accredited curriculum and a voucher to cover the cost of the GED exam. Our goal is to increase Latino access to higher education and the economic opportunities that come with it.

But, like the adults who have enrolled in the program, as a community we need to go the extra mile and take every opportunity to be self-sufficient. Our sister organization, The LIBRE Initiative, has been dedicated to providing workshops for English language learners  with over 3,000 people on our waiting list. They are partnering with economists from O'Neill Center-Southern Methodist University in Texas to instruct hundreds of public school teachers (with a significant percentage of Latino students) on free market principles. And their field team has provided thousands of adults throughout the country classes to pass their learners permit or citizenship test.

History has shown us that federal programs have never yielded the promised results regarding social inadequacies. But we must not sit with folded arms. To excel as a community we need to advance education programs that build the individual.

The task is huge. Thousands of volunteers have joined our efforts and our voice to advance measures that will help our children to have the desired success and provide instructional resources to their compatriots.

Police said the unnamed homeowner shot Rafael McCloud in the head. Details are still murky of what transpired, but authorities described a conflict that started when the homeowner confronted the intruder in his garage and ended roughly three hours later when the intruder was shot.

Police were called around 7 a.m. to the house in northern Vicksburg, where the homeowner told police he had been attacked by a man who broke into his garage around 4 a.m., Vicksburg Police Chief Walter Armstrong said.

""He was pretty much given the bum's rush by the suspect,"" Armstrong added. Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace confirmed McCloud was the intruder.

The homeowner was stabbed in the shoulder in an hours-long struggle, and Armstrong says he eventually shot the intruder. The homeowner was taken to the hospital. His wife was also injured but not seriously enough to be taken to the hospital.

The 34-year-old McCloud escaped the Warren County jail March 2 after holding a jail officer at knifepoint.

McCloud used a homemade shank to get the jump on a jail officer, Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace has said. McCloud forced the officer to give up his keys, radio, pants and jacket, and went out a door to escape. The century-old jail in downtown Vicksburg has no perimeter fence.

Officials combed the town on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River for days, interviewing family members and friends of McCloud and poking through abandoned buildings. Schools bolstered security, and Vicksburg police warned people to bring in guns from vehicles and make sure their houses hadn't been forcibly entered.

McCloud was indicted on murder and rape charges in the January 2015 death of Sharen Wilson. He had been held in the jail since his June 29 arrest, and has prior felony convictions for auto burglary, grand larceny and armed robbery.

A sheriff is confirming that a man who broke into a Mississippi home and struggled for hours with the homeowners before he was shot to death was an escaped murder suspect.

Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace said in a text message that the man killed Thursday in a Vicksburg home was 34-year-old Rafael McCloud.

Authorities McCloud escaped from jail March 2 by using a homemade shank to get a jump on a jail officer.

Officials combed the town of Vicksburg for days, interviewing family members and friends of McCloud and poking through abandoned buildings.

On Thursday morning, authorities say McCloud broke into the homeowner's garage.

An hours-long struggle ensued at the end of which the homeowner shot McCloud in the head. Exactly what happened during the struggle has not been released by authorities.

9:40 a.m.

Police say they're investigating whether a man shot and killed by a Mississippi homeowner is an escaped murder suspect.

Vicksburg Police Chief Walter Armstrong tells The Associated Press he believes the man who was killed by a gunshot to the head is Rafael McCloud, but he has not been positively identified.

Armstrong says police were called around 7 a.m. in northern Vicksburg, where a homeowner told police he had been attacked by a man who broke into his garage around 4 a.m.

The homeowner was stabbed in the shoulder in an hours-long struggle, and Armstrong says he eventually shot the intruder. Exactly what unfolded during the hours-long struggle wasn't immediately clear.

So writes a group of 31 international scientists and clinicians in an editorial in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, stating that ""substantial published evidence"" suggests such a link and calling on researchers elsewhere to take action.

They claim that some microbesthe virus and two types of bacteria, chlamydia and spirocheteare linked to the progressive neurological disease. ""We are saying there is incontrovertible evidence that Alzheimer's disease has a dormant microbial component,"" writes lead author Douglas Kell in a University of Manchester statement.

""We can't keep ignoring all of the evidence."" The authors propose that the named microbes ""reach the [central nervous system] and remain there in latent form."" They can then essentially wake up during the course of aging, under stress, or as the immune system declines.

""The consequent neuronal damage ... occurs recurrently, leading to ... ultimately AD,"" the authors posit. They point to the failure of 413 Alzheimer's drug trials conducted between 2002 and 2012 and ""express our concern that one particular aspect of the disease has been neglected,"" as ""antiviral/antimicrobial treatment of AD patients ... could rectify the 'no drug works' impasse.""

Police said the unnamed homeowner shot Rafael McCloud in the head after the suspect stabbed him in the shoulder. The entire encounter lasted roughly three hours, and the homeowner is expected to survive, The Clarion-Ledger reports.

McCloud also tied up the man's wife and their child, the newspaper adds. ""He was pretty much given the bum's rush by the suspect,"" Vicksburg Police Chief Walter Armstrong said.

Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace confirmed McCloud was the intruder. Police were called around 7 a.m. to the house in northern Vicksburg, where the homeowner told police he had been attacked by the man who broke into his garage around 4 a.m.

The 34-year-old McCloud escaped the Warren County jail March 2 after holding a jail officer at knifepoint.

McCloud used a homemade shank to get the jump on a jail officer, Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace has said. McCloud forced the officer to give up his keys, radio, pants and jacket, and went out a door to escape. The century-old jail in downtown Vicksburg has no perimeter fence.

Officials combed the town on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River for days, interviewing family members and friends of McCloud and poking through abandoned buildings. Schools bolstered security, and Vicksburg police warned people to bring in guns from vehicles and make sure their houses hadn't been forcibly entered.

The songstress's career spans six decades, and has made Parton an American icon.

That's why when the singer announced she'd be embarking on her first North American tour in 25 years, fans rejoiced. The Tennessee native is bringing her ""Pure & Simple"" tour to 60 cities in 2016.

""I've been very blessed through the years and I've been doing tours in Australia and in Europe for the last few years,"" Parton told FOX411 Country. ""But I hadn't had any big hit records in the United States in a long time. I've got a lot of history, a lot of records that have been big hits in the past but I just didn't think anybody would be interested in seeing me in concert with all the new country people and all, but evidentially they are interested.""

Parton's modesty aside, American listeners are still big fans of the 70-year-old. Her last album, ""Blue Smoke,"" released in 2014 was Parton's highest-charting solo album ever. At 37,000 copies sold in its first week, it was her best sales week for a solo endeavor.

Despite her continuing success, Parton is unsure why she is still on top.

""Well, I think there's a lot of great artists and there are people that really have that staying power...that really do draw crowds if they go out,"" she said of her fellow country artists like Reba and Hank Williams Jr. ""But I feel like I'm older than all of them and I think but I've been at it longer than all of them as well, but I just think that it's wonderful that we can all be loved and accepted...but the fact that a lot of the new people are recognize my music really makes me feel good. Makes me feel old but makes me feel good.""

Following in the longstanding tradition of storytelling that country music is known for, Parton has proudly most of her own hits and a few for others (Whitney Houston's ""I Will Always Love You"" is a Dolly original.)

However, a lot of today's artists are no longer writing their own songs and Nashville's songwriters are not seeing their ""just dues,"" Parton said.

""I do think a song is the most important thing,"" the ""Jolene"" singer said. ""A songwriter is the most important person in the business because without the song, nobody has a career because you don't have hits unless you have a hit song. So I really think songwriters are not

getting their just dues anymore and even their just monies anymore.

""I've been blessed that I've been able to write and I have written the biggest part of my hits through the years...but a lot of artists, a lot of singers don't write at all...I think a songwriter is very important and that to me, is my favorite thing that I do.""

That's not to say that the skill of songwriting is lost in country music today.

""Well there are a lot of great artists out there that really do write...like Keith Urban, he writes a lot of wonderful things of his own. Brad Paisley, great, great writer,"" Parton praised. ""I'm very proud of the singers that also can write. And Taylor, Taylor Swift, she's a great one for sure.""

Looking back on her long career, Parton reflected on what advice she would give herself when she first started out.

""Oh I don't know I'd give myself any advice. I would just say, 'You better brace yourself because we're in for the ride of our lives, and it's been a good one.""

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Opinion: Corruption investigation or political witch-hunt in Brazil?,['Amy Williams'],"On Friday, March 4th, the ever-widening investigation into corruption at Petrobras, the state-owned oil company in Brazil, ensnared former President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. Federal police raided his residence outside Sao Paulo and brought him in for three hours of questioning. Then, just yesterday, state prosecutors filed charges against Lula for money laundering, with regards to a beachfront villa they claim he owns and has kept hidden.

Its all part of an investigation called Operation Carwash, or Lava Jato in Portuguese, over a vast network of kickbacks that Petrobras allegedly gave to a consortium of infrastructure companies and network of politicians across the party spectrum, but mostly to the governing Workers Party (PT).

When news of the Fridays dawn raid broke, protestssome violenterupted on the streets of Sao Paulo. Just a week before, Lula had declared that he might run for president in the next election and that he was the most honest man in the country.

Following his detainment Friday, Lula quickly denounced his arrest as political scaremongering  an attempt by the elite to discredit him and recover the government from his PT.

Beginning with his own partys Twitter announcement of him being a political prisoner, both sides moved quickly to rally supporters and win public support. President Dilma Rousseff, herself not under investigation but with allegations swirling ever closer, went to visit Lula, her predecessor and mentor, at his home on Saturday, along with hundreds of supporters.

President Rousseff has claimed that the ongoing political crisis is not the result of mismanagement on her part, despite dismal approval ratings and a cratering economy, but the result of sore losers from the 2014 election not content to wait until 2018 for a new government. One cant help but note that she was Chair of Petrobras at the time when much of the corruption took place, and wonder, given her reputation has a micro-manager, how much she actually knew or is implicated in the scandal.

The important question is what this will mean for Brazils democracy, especially in the next few weeks. Is this just the latest stage of a much-needed cleansing of corruption and rot of Brazils political and business class?

The case has brought to light the billions of dollars that have lined the pockets of politicians and business leaders from across the ideological spectrum, possibly even touching the beloved international icon, Lula. Or is this a political witch-hunt, a new type of coup, brought on by the elites trying to bring down the symbol of social mobility for the masses, as has been claimed by Lula and the PT?

The risk is that, with Lula and the PT rallying their supporters and opposition groups staging their own protests over corruption and demanding that Rousseff resign, chaos and even potential conflict will come to Brazils streets. Ultimately, it will come down to the trust Brazilians have in their institutions to objectively resolve this issue.

While Brazilians have long considered their government inept or partisan, the past two decades of democracy have brought a series of reformsincluding by the PTthat have helped to strengthen and ensure the independence of the Brazilian state.

Ironically, as Lula and other members of the PT denounce the current investigation as a political witch-hunt, they undercut the very institutions they had helped to build. The mere act of calling the popular, iconic former president in for questioning does not prove political motive. But it does require the state prosecutors avoiding even a whiff of partisanship.

So far the prosecutors investigating Lula appear to be trying. Their statement following Lulas questioning made it clear that questioning based on evidence and suspicions does not equal final judgment, though at least one, Carlos Fernando Lima, also made it clear that being a former president did not make one exempt from investigation.

Unfortunately, it looks nearly impossible to keep politics out. While it is clear that there did exist a vast network of kickbacks among private construction companies and Petrobras (see the 19-year sentence issued to the former CEO, Marcelo Odebrecht, of one of the major construction firms involved), rather than allow the investigation to proceed unimpeded, both the PT and the opposition are jumping on every step as an excuse to wage hold political rallies.

The opposition is planning nationwide protests this upcoming Sunday, with the PT planning to hold its own the following week (March 19th).

The best for Brazils democracy and efforts to ensure integrity in both the public and private sphere is that both sides maintain restraint in converting this into a political, partisan showdown on the street. As one commentator put it, Brazil isn t Venezuela , but then again, not so long ago, Venezuela wasnt Venezuela either.

In multiple videos of the incident, Rakeem Jones, 26, is seen walking up the steps of the Fayetteville Crown Coliseum on his way out of the arena. At least two Cumberland County Sheriffs Department officers can be seen walking behind Jones as an unidentified Trump supporter with a pony tail and wearing a dark vest and cowboy hat moves to the end of one of the aisles and, with his right hand, socks Jones in the face.

Jones is briefly obscured by a crowd of people as he reaches the top of the stairs, but, the next moment, hes seen falling to the ground with a police officer on top of him. Three cops then restrain Jones for several seconds, flip him on to his stomach and then eventually lift him up and finish taking him out of the Coliseum.

The police jumped on me like I was the one swinging, Jones told The Washington Post. My eye still hurts. Its just shocking. The shock of it all is starting to set in. Its like this dude really hit me and they let him get away with it. I was basically in police custody and got hit.

But CCSO public information officer Sgt. Sean Swain disputed Jones version of events.

I couldnt see if officers took him to the ground, or if he fell to the ground. We havent talked to the officers at the top of the steps, Swain, who was at the rally, told FoxNews.com on Thursday. As I looked up, people would miss a step and theyd fall. Until we investigate it, we cant say our officers took him down to the ground. Now, we did pick him off the ground and escort him out.

[The video] only shows one perspective, he added.

A video posted by Ronnie C Rouse (@theronniec910) on Mar 9, 2016 at 8:03pm PST

Swain said police have launched an internal investigation into the incident and are also investigating the assault on Jones. Officials plan to interview Jones later on Thursday and were working to identify the man in the pony tail and cowboy hat, Swain said.

Asked why the man wasnt arrested on the spot, Swain said officers didnt see the encounter.

Both the officers are looking down [in the video] when the camera phone turns away when the guy punches, Swain said. If we had stayed and tried to reason things out right there it would have gotten very bad.

Swain said no one was arrested at the rally. However, he said Secret Service officials told him there were more protesters in Fayetteville than at any other Trump rally so far.

As people watch an eight second video and form their conclusions about what goes on, our mission that night  we have 14,000 people at the crown  was to keep everybody safe, Swain said. Our instruction was to separate people and get them out the door as quickly as possible before it escalates.

Ronnie Rouse, who was with Jones, told The Post that officers asked them to leave the rally almost as soon as Trump took the stage. Jones said someone in his group shouted something, prompting the ejection.

Now, Jones told The Post, the aftermath of the incident is adding insult to injury  in this case a swollen right cheek.

Boom, he caught me, Jones said. After I get it, before I could even gain my thoughts, Im on the ground getting escorted out. Now Im waking up this morning looking at the news and seeing me getting hit again.

Violent encounters have become a normal part of Trump events as the businessmans campaign for the Republican nomination has progressed.

Born in Havana shortly after the communist revolution, Jordan came to the U.S. with his family as a small boy along with thousands of other Cuban exiles. He attended a Catholic high school in Miami and got both his bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Miami.

Jordan, who goes by ""Bert,"" has served as a federal prosecutor, a U.S. district judge appointed by Bill Clinton and has sat on the generally conservative 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals since 2012  the first Cuban-American to do so. He also clerked for former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.

The Senate confirmed him to the Atlanta-based appeals court by a 94-5 vote.

During his confirmation hearings, Jordan was asked by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, about his views on the impartiality of judges and whether there was any place for personal or political viewpoints in their rulings.

""We are all human beings, of course, but I think as a judge you need to try and strive very, very hard to make sure you are deciding the case on something other than your own preferences and views, whatever those might be,"" Jordan replied. ""So I have strived and I hope I have achieved impartiality in my years on the bench in Miami.""

As a district judge, Jordan presided over a number of high-profile cases, including the convictions of brothers Hector and Eduardo Orlansky in a $164 million bank fraud case in which he sentenced both to 20 years behind bars. Jordan also awarded a group of Liberians $22 million in damages after they sued under a U.S. anti-torture law as victims of atrocities under former Liberian President Charles Taylor.

On the 11th Circuit, Jordan wrote an opinion concluding that black children in Alabama had no legal standing to sue over whether the state's property tax provisions prevented predominantly black school districts from raising money. Jordan wrote that courts are not always the proper forum to win relief, ""no matter how noble the cause.""

Jordan has also dissented in notable cases, including one in which the 11th Circuit majority voted to allow execution of a female Georgia death row inmate despite questions about whether a certain drug was causing botched executions.

Dennis Kainen, a Miami defense attorney and former federal public defender, said Jordan is among the most even-handed of judges he has worked with. One example, Kainen said, is that Jordan would usually address criminal defendants by their names rather than referring to them as simply, ""the defendant.""

""He has a perfect demeanor. There's no arrogance. There's no ego,"" Kainen said. ""I think he would be wonderful for the [Supreme Court]. I've never heard anything negative about Judge Jordan's temperament or demeanor.""

Great Harvest Bread Co. filed suit Thursday in federal court in Charlotte, North Carolina, against Panera Bread. The suit, filed on behalf of Great Harvest's more than 200 owner-operated stores, says it received a trademark in October 2014 for the mantra: ""Bread. The Way it ought to be.""

But the lawsuit claims that suburban St. Louis-based Panera debuted its ""Food as it should be"" advertising campaign just eight months later. Great Harvest, based in Dillon, Montana, says the Panera campaign intentionally causes confusion.

Hannah Kiresuk, 19, was diagnosed with juvenile refractory myasthenia gravis, a rare autoimmune disorder that has no cure. Shes undergone more than 30 surgeries and procedures, countless rounds of chemotherapy and has spent hundreds of long nights in the hospital. Through it all, her stuffed animal Hammy has been with her.

Hes been there for 300 nights in the hospital, almost two years of chemotherapy, 30-plus surgeries, Kiresuk told Fox 9. The toy had bandages, zip up sutures and medical tubes to represent each of Kiresuks procedure.

The cow toy went missing after it fell out of Kiresuks backpack in early March while she was attending a benefit held in her honor in Minneapolis, Fox 9 reported. She had used the skyway to pass the Target Center, home of the Timberwolves, and past the teams offices. While efforts to find Hammy fell short, the Wolves invited Kiresuk and her family to a March 8 matchup against the San Antonio Spurs at Target Center.

After a couple of days went by and Hammy hadnt been found, we decided to reach out and see if we could do something, not to replace Hammy  Hammy can never be replaced, but try to do something [to make it] a little less traumatizing for the family, Brad Ruiter, Timberwolves spokesman told Fox 9.

At the game Timberwolves guard Tyus Jones presented Kiresuk with a new companion, a stuffed dog which she named Wiggy after star player Andrew Wiggins.

Its nice to have moments where you dont remember youre sick, she told the news station.

While there is no cure for her disorder, the family is hopeful that a bone marrow transplant will allow Kiresuk to live a fuller life. They are currently fundraising to help cover costs.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Mr. Obama, words matter. Call the massacre of Mideast Christians what it is: Genocide",['Jay Sekulow'],"The images are horrific. Who can forget the video of masked Islamic jihadists on a beach beheading Christians -- executing them on-camera for the world to see?

And while there has been condemnation of the massacre of Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East, theres an important step the Obama administration must take to address this ongoing tragedy that has resulted in the slaughter or displacement of nearly one million Christians.

Words matter. And how we describe these atrocities is critical. Sure, these acts are barbaric, horrendous, and even monstrous.

But theres one word the Obama administration will not use to describe these atrocities. The White House  as well as the State Department  refuses to call these acts genocide.

The United Nations (UN) Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. That is certainly what is happening to Christians being executed by ISIS  the Islamic State  around the world.

But the word genocide carries with it important legal ramifications, too. Genocide violates international law and such a designation is necessary to activate certain legal requirements of the UN Genocide Convention that would force President Obama to protect Christians.

In short, all President Obamas talk about the slaughter of Christians doesnt require action. Labeling these heinous atrocities against Christians as genocide legally requires action. Dying Christians dont need more talk; they need action.

In a letter to Secretary of State Kerry, the American Center for Law and Justice outlined in-depth the legal arguments explaining why the United States, the U.N., and the rest of the international community must recognize this as genocide and act accordingly to stop it.

We have been working in the international community and here at home to underscore the importance of this official genocide designation.

We have filed legal documents with the U.N. and on Friday we will be presenting key oral statements there. We filed an amicus brief, including testimony from survivors of ISIS genocide, with the European Court of Human Rights. And we have seen positive results.

The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament has declared that ISIS is committing genocide against Christians.

Here at home, members of Congress understand whats at stake. The House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously approved a bipartisan resolution last week that would officially label what ISIS is doing to Christians as genocide.

The resolution expresses the sense of Congress that all governments, including the United States ... should call ISIL atrocities by their rightful names: war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.

Many Americans understand the importance of acting now. In fact, weve heard from nearly 215,000 people urging the Obama administration to label the Middle East atrocities genocide.

However, the Obama administration refuses to act  refuses to embrace that language.

The White House continues to say that no determination has yet been reached with respect to labelling the ongoing massacre as genocide.

And Secretary Kerry continues to waffle. He recently told the House Appropriations Subcommittee that he is still reviewing the issue saying there must be additional evaluation done before a decision is made about using the designation.

Secretary Kerry, what are you waiting for? You have the facts. You see the carnage. Why is the Obama administration dragging its feet on this issue?

Some believe it goes directly to administrations philosophy and repeated refusal to identify the enemy as radical Islamic terrorism.

Consider this important exchange as reported by NBC News from that same recent Congressional hearing:

""The whole world knows Christians are being slaughtered in the Middle East,"" said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican and frequent critic of the Obama Administration. Rohrabacher also was not satisfied when Kerry said the greatest threat to the U.S. is ""violent extremism, radical religious extremism."" When Rohrabacher asked Kerry why he didn't use the words ""radical Islamic terrorism,"" Kerry quickly answered: ""It is predominantly Islamic and I have no hesitation in saying that.""

Heres what we know. As long as the Obama administration refuses to recognize the slaughter of Christians for what it is  genocide  the sad truth is that the United States is not doing everything in its power to protect the persecuted.

That must change. With the Obama administration facing a March 17th deadline for determining whether it will use the label, its time to send a powerful message to the president right now:

Mr. President, words matter. Call the ongoing massacre of Christians what it is  genocide  so the United States and the global community can provide them the vital legal protections they deserve.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Cardinals shortstop Jhonny Peralta out 10-12 weeks after thumb surgery,[],"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. -- St. Louis Cardinals shortstop Jhonny Peralta had surgery Thursday to repair a torn ligament in his left thumb and likely will be sidelined for about 10-to-12 weeks.

Manager Mike Matheny anticipated Peralta will return to the team's spring training site in Jupiter, Florida, in a few days. The surgery took place in St. Louis after Peralta got a second opinion.

Matheny said the Cardinals will consult with the surgeon, Dr. Charlie Goldfarb, to find out when Peralta can eturn to action.

""I haven't heard an exact date that I'd feel comfortable passing around,"" Matheny said.

Matheny also said catcher Yadier Molina checked out fine a day after playing three innings behind the plate in his spring training debut. Molina, who had a pair of offseason operations, could play again Friday, catching Carlos Martinez, but won't bat for about a week.

Peralta had surgery this morning on his left hand, Mozeliak confirms. Says other teams have called offering SS, i.e. 'Ambulance chasing.'  Derrick Goold (@dgoold) March 10, 2016

Offseason acquisition Jedd Gyorko is likely to get the first chance to fill in at shortstop. The Cardinals also have utilityman Greg Garcia and prospect Aledmys Diaz in camp.

Diaz started on Thursday, a day after Gyorko got the nod. Matheny said Garcia, who appeared in 49 games last year, likely will play a lot in later innings of games. Earlier in the week, Diaz had a four-hit game.

""We've seen Garcia out there and have a pretty good idea. Haven't seen much of Diaz and haven't seen much of Gyorko,"" Matheny said. ""We need to see for ourselves.""

Gyorko was a college shortstop and started 28 games at shortstop last year with San Diego. Like Peralta, Gyorko is a power hitter with perhaps less range than prototypical shortstops. He had 16 homers and 57 RBI last year; Peralta had 17 homers and 71 RBI.

Matheny said the Cardinals have analyzed data on Gyorko but isn't that enamored as metrics like range factor. He wants to see for himself.

""I'd like to say it holds a lot of water, but the most recent experience I have is we picked up Jhonny Peralta and everybody told us what he could not do at shortstop,"" Matheny said. ""We've been very happy with what Jhonny has been able to do and everybody told us we shouldn't expect much.""",[]

Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, has said that if you are white, ""you don't know what it's like to be poor.""

He should drive some of the roads I've driven in West Virginia, among other places. Some of the homes of the white poor look like throwbacks from an earlier time.

Sanders attempted to ""clarify"" his comment (a political synonym for walking it back when it didn't play well) during a town hall meeting Monday night in Detroit. Fox News anchor Bret Baier asked him about his remark and Sanders replied, ""I know about white poverty. There is no candidate in this race who has talked more about poverty than I have.""

Therein lies the problem. The left talks a lot about poverty, but when it comes to programs and ideas to help people climb out of poverty their only solution is to spend more money. If money alone were enough to extricate people from poverty and help them sustain themselves with a job and a strong family, then the more than $1 trillion spent on anti-poverty programs since the Great Society was launched by President Johnson in 1964 would have reduced the number of poor people in America. And yet, the poverty rate changes very little. A rational person might conclude that spending more money on programs that have failed to achieve their stated goals is not the right answer.

In April and May of 1964, President Johnson and the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, toured the Appalachian states. After their visit he vowed to wipe out poverty. He didn't and his successors haven't either.

What do I, a now ""prosperous"" white guy, know about poverty?

In 1965, I was a private first class in the U.S. Army, working at Armed Forces Radio in New York City for the astronomical wage of $99 a month. All of us enlisted men had second jobs to make ends meet. Mine was as an engineer at WOR-TV. I had no car, the subway was 10 cents (soon to jump to 15 cents, producing cries from the left that it would harm the poor). I had no savings and as one payday approached I had only a dime in my pocket for a one-way trip to work. Had the paycheck not arrived, I had no idea how to get home to our little apartment in Elmhurst, Queens. Hitchhiking in New York City was not an option.

What I did have was incentive. I did not accept my poverty status as the final verdict on a young life. To paraphrase the song, if I couldn't make it in America, I couldn't make it anywhere. And so I kept at it until my Army discharge and then I moved back to Washington where I finished college, worked at a civilian media job and persisted until breaks came.

While poverty does not have simple solutions, there are solutions. They begin with relaying stories to the poor about people who used to be in their situation but liberated themselves from a life of want and need by making the right life choices. Inspiration and hope do not come from government. They come from within. They also come from churches, more of which can and should ""adopt"" a poor family and help them move out of poverty.

The fracas happened on the same day the billionaire real estate mogul wont the Peach states Republican primary.

Well, they was walking down the street, we was sitting outside, David Grant told The Washington Post in a telephone interview. Three Hispanic males grabbed it up, wadded it up, threw it down the road.

Grant said that he went to confront the men and that is where things got heated. One of the mean allegedly pulled out a gun and purportedly threatened Grant.

He said you are about to get a cap popped in youre a**! Then he started patting his stomach and then showed a handgun, Grant told local media.

Grant then said that his neighbor  a Hispanic man  came outside with his own gun to defend him as the men quickly retreated.

Grant called police and soon after, with the help of his cousin, chased the three men down and held them until police arrived. The three men - Hector Ayala, 20, and Mauricio Rodriguez, 18, and a 17-year-old male  were arrested.

Ayala was charged with disorderly conduct; Rodriguez with making terroristic threats, criminal trespass and possession of less than an ounce of marijuana; and the 17-year old with aggravated assault, possession of a firearm without a license, possession of a handgun under the age of 18 and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony.

Grant said the incident on his street speaks to the issues that Trump brings up while on the campaign trail.

Trump stands against all that gang violence and stuff, people coming over here and bringing in guns, he said. Thats what they are doing.

The town where Grant lives, Dalton, is an economically struggling area along the states border with Tennessee that has in recent years seen its Latino population grow dramatically. The city is 48 percent Latino.

Weve had problems over here with Hispanics, Grant said.

He said Hispanics also allegedly have messed with his familys Confederate paraphernalia.

We got family that served in the Civil War, he said. We put our flags up, had people steal flags out of the yard. Its just been an ongoing thing. Were the only people here who stand up for what we believe in.

Grant describes himself as a big Trump supporter.

With political issues, people cant handle it, he said. When youre messing with Trump, youre messing with us.

The president addressed the 2016 race during a joint press conference at the White House with visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Obama also used the forum to renew pressure on Senate Republicans to consider his eventual nominee to the Supreme Court vacancy.

But he scolded the party on several fronts, while reflecting on a question about whether he feels any responsibility for partisanship in Washington and on the campaign trail. On the 2016 race, he said Donald Trumps immigration positions arent all that different from those of the other candidates. And he said he actually wants to see an effective Republican Party in part to challenge blind spots in his own party.

But he also referred to the current state of affairs on the GOP primary trail as a circus and Republican crackup.

He also addressed the Supreme Court replacement process, while offering little in the way of hints as to whom he might pick.

Im going to do my job, and my expectation is going to be, will the Senate do its job? he said.

He said he hopes cooler heads will prevail"" and Republicans will back down from a plan to block a Supreme Court nominee.

He spoke as Republicans dug in on their resistance to any Obama nominee, as they argue the decision should be left to the next president.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said Democrats are only criticizing the strategy to score political points -- and efforts to change his mind are futile.

""I think we need to be crystal clear: It won't work,"" Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a 15-minute speech. He said Democratic blowback is ""all about using this process to score political points, it's that simple.""

As for whom Obama might pick, the president said only that he wants an outstanding jurist with impeccable legal credentials  and who, by historical standards, would not even be questioned as qualified for the court.

Yet his pool of potential picks has been shrinking in recent days, with several prominent individuals taking themselves out of the running, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

In his search for a replacement for the late Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, Obama is reported to be zeroing in on a small group of appellate court judges with largely traditional credentials and a history of bipartisan backing.

Obama's top tier of candidates include Judge Sri Srinivasan of U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Merrick Garland, chief judge on the same court, and Judge Paul Watford of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a source familiar with the selection process told the Associated Press. Ketanji Brown Jackson, a D.C. district court judge, is also under consideration, although a less likely option, said the source.

The Obama-Trudeau meetings Thursday in Washington marked the first official visit in nearly two decades by a Canadian prime minister, a charismatic and youthful liberal leader intent on tight ties with the United States.

At the ornate arrival ceremony on the South Lawn, Obama and first lady Michelle Obama welcomed Trudeau, the 44-year-old son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and his wife, Sophie Gregoire.

""There is no relationship in the entire world like the Canada-U.S. relationship,"" Trudeau said. ""We grew up together.""

Despite that close geographical and political alliance, no Canadian prime minister had made an official visit since 1997, a fact that Obama noted.

""It's about time, eh?"" Obama said, playing up the American stereotype of a Canadian colloquialism.

Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, with more than $2 billion worth of goods and services crossing the border every day. About 75 percent of Canada's exports go to the U.S.

Besides trade, the two leaders were expected to seek common ground on environmental protection. Before their meeting, the U.S. and Canada said in a statement that they will work to put in place an international agreement in Paris on curbing global warming. They committed to reducing methane emissions by 40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels over the coming decade.

Methane is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted in the U.S. from human activities and is much more efficient at trapping radiation than carbon dioxide.

Tall and fit, Justin Trudeau channels the charisma of his father. He aims to restore his father's legacy as leader of the Liberal Party, which was under siege during 10 years of Conservative rule under Stephen Harper, Trudeau's predecessor.

Harper's relations with Obama were strained over various issues, notably the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, which the Obama administration rejected last year. The American ambassador to Canada, Bruce Heyman, could not get a meeting with Harper or his Cabinet ministers for months.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,25 things you need to know about Donald Trump's *yuge* USFL team,[],"This isn't the first time Donald Trump unexpectedly stepped into a new profession, embarking on a quest that brought a ton of fanfare, headlines, enemies, bombastic statements, talking points, jokes about his hair and a specific fear in people's eyes as they ponder the possible future. Thirty years ago, Trump bought a USFL team and its story has so many parallels to his current presidential run that it'll make that blonde bird's nest sitting upon your head spin and spin. Here are 25 things to know about Donald Trump's yuge -- YUGE -- USFL team, the New Jersey Generals.

1. Trump bought into the USFL in the league's second year.

Though Trump is the man most associated with the fun, but failed, football league, he actually wasn't a founding member. Though he says he was initially courted, he was busy with Trump Tower instead. But when the Oklahoma oil magnate who originally owned the New Jersey Generals didn't like owning a team halfway across the country, he sold to Trump for a price of between $5 million (Trump's number) and $9 million (most published reports). So, clearly for like $8.5 million or something.

2. Lawrence Taylor once signed with Trump and the Generals.

Though Taylor, the monster linebacker out of North Carolina, was under contract with the New York Giants until 1988, Trump signed him to a futures deal in 1983 and immediately wired him a $1 million loan. The deal was complicated but said LT would play for the Generals when his Giants contract was up. It would have also have offseason personal services terms (making appearances, shaking hands, signing autographs, etc.) even though LT still would have been with the G-Men. The Giants and NFL freaked out, bought out Taylor's USFL contract, gave him a massive raise (he'd receive $1.1 million in the final year of his contract instead of the $220,000 he was set for), made LT return the $1 million loan and paid Trump $750,000 for giving up the option. Later, Trump would say he never expected LT to play in the USFL and vice-versa. In essence, he made headlines, three-quarters of a million dollars and got Taylor a massive raise all on a publicity stunt. Say what you will about the man, but dude knows how to self market.

3. Trump also courted Don Shula, who seriously considered the offer.

Shula was severely underpaid as Dolphins coach, according to Trump, so the Generals owner wanted give the future Hall of Famer what he deserved. The pair negotiated for months and eventually Shula seemed ready to jump to the USFL. There was one contingency: Though the million-dollar-a-year contract was acceptable, Shula also wanted an apartment in Trump Tower. Trump declined, saying, in what might be the most Donald Trump quote ever, ""[the apartment is] more than money, more than salary, that's gold."" But like the other negotiations, there was more than meets the eye. Trump got publicity for his team and his Trump Tower, which was so exclusive that he couldn't give away an apartment (exaggerated eye roll), while Shula got a raise and was able to stay and coach Miami's new quarterback, some guy named Dan Marino.

4. Even before his first game as owner, Trump had an idea for the Galaxy Bowl.

Here's how Sports Illustrated described it in 1984

The United States Football League begins its second season in two weeks, but Donald J. Trump, who has become the biggest and most visible wheeler-dealer in all of sport since buying the New Jersey Generals in September, is already looking forward to what he calls the Galaxy Bowl. The Galaxy Bowl? Yes, the Galaxy Bowl. According to Trump, who thought up the name, it would pit the USFL championship team against the winner of the NFL's Super Bowl.

5. Trump had an ideal USFL player in mind when he bought into the league.

Unfortunately for Trump, he never get his USFL Adonis to come play. Trump thought Washington Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann was the kind of guy who would have been perfect for the looser, funner USFL. Of course, Theismann and Trump's buddy Lawrence Taylor would soon become inextricably linked anyway.

6. The team's priest was the famed author of The Positive of Powerful Thinking and its lawyer was the flamboyant Commie-knockin' Roy Cohn.

The priest was Norman Vincent Peale. Cohn was Joe McCarthy's aide during the Red Scare in the 1950s and eventually named chief counsel to the subcommittee on the Senate's Communist-busting permanent investigations subcommittee. It was a job coveted by Robert F. Kennedy and when Cohn got it, the two became lifelong enemies, once getting into a fistfight in the U.S. Capitol. Years later, one of the USFL's teams, the Washington Generals, play in a stadium named for the late RFK.

7. Even Burt Reynolds, a stake holder in another USFL team, found Trump captivating:

""Everyone was so in awe of this man who made so much money,"" Reynolds told an ESPN documentary team. Burt Reynolds! In awe of a 37-year-old! A 37-year-old named Trump! It makes you rethink the entirety of Smoky and the Bandit.

8. Ivana Trump designed the cheerleader uniforms and Andy Warhol was a judge at tryouts.

The iconic, colorful artist said he showed up late though because, he said, the Trumps ""never bought the paintings I did of Trump Tower.""

9. The real-estate magnate had an interesting theory about his public negotiations and (eventually) losing money as a sports owner.

In 1983, he told The New York Times: ""I hire a general manager to help run a billion-dollar business and there's a squib in the papers. I hire a coach for a football team and there are 60 and 70 reporters calling to interview me."" I say this with resigned awe, but you could multiply the self-promotion power of every Kardashian and Kanye and still not get to where Trump was in the 1980s.

10. One of the NFL's most unexpected MVPs, Brian Sipe, was Trump's first big signing, but he only lasted a year when Trump found a new toy in DougFlutie.

Sipe won an MVP with the Cleveland Browns and if not for Redskins kicker Mark Moseley winning the award in the truncated 1983 season, he may have been the most unlikely winner ever. He was effective with the Generals, but when Flutie came to New Jersey in '85 (he was the third-straight Heisman winner to go to the USFL and his deal was helped along by Howard Cosell), Sipe was released, as Trump figured that $800,000 was too much for a backup. Either that or his hands were too small. I have huge hands. It makes it hard to type this post. I'll show ya.

11. Trump once phoned his coach from the owner's box telling him to put an injured Doug Flutie in the game.

Flutie signed with the Generals after his Heisman year at Boston College. But he got hurt during the season and sat out the Generals' playoff game. With the team losing, Tump called down to the field and demanded that coach Walt Michaels take out Ron Reeves to go with the ailing Flutie. Michaels, the former Jets coach, declined. Later on, Flutie would credit the coach for saving his body and, perhaps, his career, even though he himself wanted to play. The irony: Had Sipe been retained, he'd have been in the game and Trump would have likely never demanded to play an injured Flutie.

12. The Generals biggest rivals during their brief existence was with a team coached by Steve Spurrier.

Spurrier would finishedwith the third-best record of any USFL coach. The best? Jim Mora whose Philadelphia teams did make the playoffs (playoffs?) all three years and won two titles. (Who says Philly football can't win championships?)

13. The Generals went from 6-12 in their first season to 14-4 in their first season with Trump.

In the third and final season of the league, the Generals went 11-7, making Donald Trump 25-11 as the owner of a professional sports team. The team was 0-2 in playoff games under Trump.

14. Trump's team averaged 41,000 fans at home games.

Attendance figures were up-and-down throughout the league but New York and the south, in particular, took to the UFSL. In 1985, 73,227 watched the Jacksonville Bulls host the Generals, a league record. In 2015, the largest attendance for a Jaguars game was the 65,443 fans who saw the Jags and Dolphins in Week 2.

15. Trump was one of many in football to do battle with Al Davis.

The fought over, interestingly, backup quarterback Marc Wilson. There were promises, agreements, battles and bluffs, eventually ending with Wilson re-upping with the Raiders. Said Trump at the time, ""I'm not interested in backup quarterbacks. They [agent Howard Slusher and Wilson] played Al Davis like a drum.""

Slusher responded to this, via SI:

""That was the all-timer. Played him like a drum.' Nobody plays Al Davis like a drum. Look what you've got. Al ended up with the guy he wanted. And in New Jersey you've got a man whose ego is so great he didn't want to let it look like he lost a player. He could've said, 'Look, we didn't get this guy, but we're gonna go after so-and-so,' and made a positive statement. Instead he lies.""

Yuge accusation.

16. During his time as owner, Trump volunteered to do arms negotiations with the Soviets.

He told The Washington Post:

""Some people have an ability to negotiate. It's an art you're basically born with. You either have it or you don't. It would take an hour and a half to learn everything there is to learn about missiles...I think I know most of it anyway.""

17. One of first ESPN 30 for 30's was called Small Potatoes: Who Killed the USFL? Their answer was Trump.

The great documentary (it's available on Netflix, go watch it both for the entertainment value and the insane highlights of a young Herschel Walker running) was basically an anti-Trump screed, directed by a former league employee turned FOBS (friend of Bill Simmons), Mike Tollin. He doesn't unfairly go at Trump (he doesn't need to). Tollin simply lays out a case made by many: That Trump's greed led to the downfall of the league.

18. ""If God wanted football in the spring he wouldn't have created baseball.""

It was with this quote that Trump justified the USFL's desire to move to the fall to challenge the NFL head-on. The USFL had played two seasons in the spring before deciding to play one more season (in 1985) and then move to the fall and challenge the NFL in 1986.

But did Trump really want that? Probably not. The theory is Trump's (and the USFL's) $1.69 billion anti-trust lawsuit against the NFL was about earning a huge jury award or settlement. If that didn't happen, he figured he'd be invited into the league to become an owner for free, especially after merging with a Houston team that gave the Generals Jim Kelly, Herschel Walker and Doug Flutie. (That team would never play.) Basically, he was trying to replicate the AFL's plan of 20 years earlier.

19. Trump said in court that Pete Rozelle had offered Trump an NFL franchise.

""Never, never,"" said Rozelle when he was asked about the exchange.

20. During the trial, an NFL attorney accused Trump of bribing waiters and busboys to spy on discussions between NFL owners.

Trump, of course, denied it. If that were true, it would have made Trump a lot like another brash upstart who sued the NFL: the aforementioned Al Davis, who was accused of such much bugging and spying he makes the Patriots seem like a Cub Scout troop.

21. The USFL won the lawsuit against the NFL. The jury awarded the league $1.00.

A jury agreed that the NFL was a monopoly but, perhaps because of the negative portrayal of Trump by the NFL's lawyers, the jury awarded just that single dollar, a move which essentially ended the USFL.

On the bright side, because anti-trust damages triple and the USFL appealed the verdict, by the time all the court options were exhausted, the accrued interest increased the reward to $3.76.

22. Trump technically did kill the league.

Though you can lay blame on a bunch of different parties (though Trump would certainly be the No. 1 pick), even The Donald can't argue this: When he voted ""no"" on the question of whether the USFL would play in the fall of 1986 (months after the verdict was announced), it effectively ended the league, as the TV deal was contingent on the existence of a New York team.

23. In a great clip from the Tollin doc, ESPN's Bob Ley reported on how a real-estate magnate had bought into the upstart football league:

After noting that this real-estate king's neighbors were Gucci, Tiffany and Cartier, Ley said that Donald Trump was a ""low-key guy in a high-pressure world."" I'm just going to go ahead and say that was the journalistic low-point in the career of the great Ley.

24. Trump, who never has any complaints about his failed business ventures, had no complaints about this failed business venture:

""After taxes, I would say I lost $3 million,"" he told the AP. ""And I got a billion dollars of free publicity.''

25. Trump was oddly prescient about the Cowboys though.

With the team for sale in '84, Trump, who says he could have bought the team, blustered:

""I feel sorry for the poor guy who is going to buy the Dallas Cowboys. It's a no-win situation for him, because if he wins, well, so what, they've won through the years, and if he loses, which seems likely because they're having troubles, he'll be known to the world as a loser.""

Bum Bright bought the team for $85 million in 1984, the team tanked, and he sold the franchise by 1989 for $170 million. So Bright may have been a loser, but a rich one. The Cowboys are now worth $4 billion, by the way, or about the same value as Trump Steaks.

But let's imagine that Trump had gone ahead about purchased the 'Boys in '84, turned the team around and continued to own the team today. What would have come of a slick, silver-tongued oilman from Arkansas? It's simple, really: Jerry Jones in 2016.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Attention Turns to Ohio and Florida in Race for the White House,['Clint Henderson'],"Republicans will debate in the key state of Florida tonight in a battle between Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, John Kasich and Ted Cruz.

Donald Trump gave an interview to Anderson Cooper last night that had some good sound for us to use today.

Rubio is struggling after disappointing results Tuesday night where he didnt get a single delegate. He apparently held a rally at a nearly empty stadium yesterday.

Rubio has not run a single campaign ad in Florida according to the Wall Street Journal which reports hes relied there on Super Pacs.

New Fox polling has more bad news for the Florida senator in his home states. It has Trump beating Rubio by 43 to 20% in the Sunshine state.

Marco Rubio told Megyn Kelly he regretted the tone of his attacks on Donald Trump. Hes backed away from vitriolic attacks against Donald Trump that now appear to have backfired.

Those Fox News polls have better news for John Kasich and his home state of Ohio. Kasich beats Trump 34 to 29% there according to our new polling. If Kasich wins Ohio, Donald Trump would need to get 59% of the remaining delegates to secure the nomination before the convention.

Still Donald Trump is the front runner riding momentum at this moment. Trip Gabriel writes today in the New York Times:

But Mr. Trump gained something even more valuable than delegates on Tuesday: momentum as the race heads into a watershed moment, March 15, when the first states that award delegates winner-take-all hold their primaries. They include Senator Marco Rubio's home state, Florida, and Gov. John Kasich's, Ohio. Both men have their backs to the wall, fighting for their political lives.

The Democrats had a lively debate hosted by Univision last night that focused on who would be more liberal on illegal immigration.

Clinton slammed Sanders over his votes during the financial collapse. Bernie accused Clinton of distorting his record. He also reiterated his claims that Clinton was indebted to Wall Street.

Host Jorge Ramos asked Hillary Clinton if she would drop out if she was indicted. She dismissed his question, Oh for goodness (sake), that is not going to happen. Im not even going to answer that question.

Heres how the Washington Post writer Dan Balz put it today Democrats got a taste Wednesday night of where their nominating contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders could be heading - toward a grueling and increasingly contentious battle that could continue until the primaries end in June. Sanders said his close victory in Michigan is evidence his message is resonating. But Clinton now has more delegates than Barack Obama did against her in 2008. She also has more than half the delegates needed to secure the nomination. 

Still, Sanders is likely to keep up the pressure all the way to the convention.

Under House Bill 4, also known as the Parent Involvement and Accountability Act, teachers would be required to grade parents involvement with their childrens education.

The legislation, by state Rep. Gregory Holloway (D-Hazlehurst), would mandate a section be added to each childs report card on which the parents are graded on their responsiveness to communication with teachers, the students completion of homework and readiness for tests, and the frequency of absences and tardiness.

Mary Clare Reim, research associate on education at the Heritage Foundation, said the bill is the wrong way to encourage more parental involvement.

My initial reaction is, this is absurd, Reim said. The concept that parents should be graded by teachers on their involvement is a reversal of what the education system should look like. Parents should be grading teachers on their performance. Putting grades on parental involvement from the top down is not the way this should work.

Police said the unnamed homeowner shot Rafael McCloud in the head after the suspect stabbed him in the shoulder. The entire encounter lasted roughly three hours and the homeowner is expected to survive, The Clarion-Ledger reports.

McCloud also tied up the man's wife and their child, the newspaper adds. ""He was pretty much given the bum's rush by the suspect,"" Vicksburg Police Chief Walter Armstrong said.

Warren County Sheriff Martin Pace confirmed McCloud was the intruder. Police were called around 7 a.m. to the house in northern Vicksburg, where the homeowner told police he had been attacked by the man who broke into his garage around 4 a.m.

McCloud's death ends the manhunt that started when the 34-year-old escaped the Warren County jail March 2.

McCloud used a homemade shank to get the jump on a jail officer, Pace said. McCloud forced the officer to give up his keys, radio, pants and jacket, and went out a door to escape. The century-old jail in downtown Vicksburg has no perimeter fence.

Officials combed the town on a bluff overlooking the Mississippi River for days, interviewing family members and friends of McCloud and poking through abandoned buildings. Schools bolstered security, and Vicksburg police warned people to bring in guns from vehicles and make sure their houses hadn't been forcibly entered.

McCloud was indicted on murder and rape charges in the January 2015 death of Sharen Wilson. He had been held in the jail since his June 29 arrest, and has prior felony convictions for auto burglary, grand larceny and armed robbery.

The visit Thursday, Anderson's first in free agency, was a small victory for the Dolphins because he's being courted by other teams.

Anderson, a three-year veteran, rushed for 720 yards last year for the Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos. They would have five days to match any offer from the Dolphins.

New Miami coach Adam Gase was offensive coordinator for the Broncos and Anderson in 2013-14. The Dolphins lost Miller when he agreed to a free agent deal Wednesday with the Houston Texans.

Joseph Cruz and Lionel Clah were last accounted for Wednesday night in the Roswell area while in a prisoner transport van in Artesia, a town about 80 miles from the Texas border, New Mexico State Police said.

Both Cruz and Clah were shackled and wearing white prison jumpsuits before they fled as they were being taken from the state prison in Santa Fe to another state facility, authorities said. Details on how they escaped were not immediately released.

""These prisoners should be considered dangerous and the public should use caution,"" Sgt. Elizabeth Armijo, a police spokeswoman, in a release.

Cruz, 32, has been serving a life sentence for first-degree murder since 2007. Authorities say he fatally stabbed another man over drugs in Raton in northern New Mexico.

Clah, 29, was convicted in 2009 of armed robbery and two counts of assault with intent to commit a violent felony on a peace officer.

Their escape came after another inmate fled a minimum-security facility south of Albuquerque in the middle of the night in November. Corrections Department officials warned state lawmakers of dangerously low-staffing levels at facilities across the state.

Cruz and Clah have multiple tattoos, including some that are visible on their neck and arms. Cruz has the word ""TRIBAL"" tattooed on his neck, while ""SHIPROCK NATIVE"" is tattooed on Clah's neck.",[]

The committee's chairman, Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., had delayed action on Szubin's and all other nominations before his panel, stubbornly refusing to act until winning his re-election primary last week. It's the panel's first confirmation vote since Republicans regained control of the chamber last year.

The committee approved Szubin's nomination on a 14-8 vote that reflected sweeping GOP opposition to President Barack Obama's controversial nuclear deal with Iran, which involves the lifting of sanctions on the longtime U.S. adversary.

""I think he's a nice man, and he's obviously well-educated and qualified for a lot of jobs, probably that,"" Shelby said after the vote. ""But the policies he'd have to carry out, a lot of us oppose them.""

In a subsequent statement, Shelby added: ""Mr. Szubin's role at the Treasury Department has required him to both promote and defend the administration's ill-conceived Iran nuclear agreement. I could not support his nomination today because of his participation in facilitating a deal that I believe is crippling to our national security.""

The panel appears likely to act soon to fill vacancies on the Securities and Exchange Commission and approve a new director of the U.S. Mint. But a key appointee to the Export-Import Bank remains stuck, leaving the bank unable to approve larger financial transactions.

Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, senior Democrat on the committee, said the panel has acted on just one of its 19 nominees. ""I'm hopeful we'll move on a lot more than these. I hope we'll do Ex-Im.""

The opposition to Szubin's nomination could spell trouble for speedy action by the full Senate, since any individual senator could delay a vote.

The 15-year-old took his own life on Dec. 8 after his parents found out the school wasn't going to give their son the letter of recommendation he needed to take the entrance exam for his high school of choice.

The school, located in the town of Fuchu, wouldn't pen the letter because the teen's file noted he had been busted for shoplifting during his first year at the schooleven though it turned out it had been a different student who committed the crime.

""Our child would never have taken his life if the school's data management had not been sloppy,"" a statement from the boy's family read.

What's said to have happened: The teacher who entered the shoplifting charge into the school's records was basing the entry on a verbal report from another faculty member and plugged in the wrong name.

The mistake was discovered in October 2013, but while the error was fixed on paper, it remained in the school's electronic records. The school's in-house probe found the school was to blame for the boy's death due to ""poor clerical management and career guidance,"" per Kyodo News.

The ""career guidance"" portion relates to the boy's homeroom teacher, who spoke with him five times about progressing to high school, reports the Mainichi.

Those sessions consisted of five-minute interactions in the school hallway. Principal Hiroshi Sakamoto also apologized for initially saying the boy had died of heart failure. (This typo thwarted a $1 billion bank heist.)

foxnews.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Last Gasp for Coal Mining Industry?,['Dunstan Prial'],"The U.S. coal mining industry, in decline for decades as environmental regulations have steered consumers toward newer, cheaper and cleaner energy technologies, appears to be heading toward life support amid the recent plunge in energy prices.

Overall, the U.S. mining sector has been particularly hard hit since the price of oil peaked in the summer of 2014 and subsequently began its precipitous decline. This ongoing contraction stood out in stark contrast within last weeks otherwise solid February jobs report released by the U.S. Department of Labor.

As the price of oil, natural gas and coal have declined amid falling global demand, the need for workers to drill and mine these resources has diminished. And as mining and drilling companies have scaled back operations, so too have the vast web of support services such as transportation and construction that are dependent on the energy sector.

According to the Labor Department, employment in mining continued to decline in February with the industry losing 19,000 jobs mainly in support activities (16,000) and coal mining (2,000). Since a recent peak in September 2014, mining has shed 171,000 jobs, with more than three-fourths of the loss in support activities for mining, the Labor Department said in a statement.

Wyoming, the largest U.S. coal producing state for three decades, has seen its entire economy impacted.

Were more dependent on the energy sector and mining makes up a larger part of our economy than any other state, said David Bullard, senior economist for the research and planning section of the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services. Were less diversified.

Bullard said the current situation in Wyoming appears worse than the statewide economic hurt suffered during the most recent decline in energy prices back in 2009 and 2010 in the wake of the global financial crisis. Its starting to look more reminiscent of what happened back in the mid-1980s when energy prices suddenly collapsed. The state went through a severe downturn in the 1980s, there was high unemployment and significant outmigration, Bullard said.

No one has a crystal ball that can predict when energy prices will rise again.

Its hard to say when it will happen but it doesnt appear to be soon. It doesnt appear to be this year or early in 2017, said Bullard, noting that the U.S. Energy Information Administration has been revising its forecasts for demand downward in recent months, which means prices won't be moving higher.

If prices remain low, the states economy will continue to suffer and I expect we will continue to lose jobs. Its a big if, no one knows what will happen with prices but the states economy does tend to move with those prices, said Bullard.

The situation is just as dire across the country, notably in the coal mining districts of Appalachia where the demise of the coal industry has crushed entire regions of Eastern Kentucky and West Virginia. And the momentum is decidedly in favor of newer, cleaner technologies.

Coal's share of electricity generation has been falling, largely because of competition with natural gas, the EIA said in a report last week. Environmental regulations affecting power plants have also played a role.

Related Image Expand / Contract

Utility companies retired nearly 18,000 megawatts of electric generating capacity in 2015 -- a relatively high amount compared with recent years, according to the EIA -- about 80% of which was derived from conventional coal-fired power plants.

The amount of coal capacity retired last year represents nearly 5% of total U.S. coal capacity, according to the EIA. About half of those retired megawatts came from Ohio, Georgia and Kentucky, with those states each retiring at least 10% of their coal capacity last year. Most of those coal-burning facilities were more than five decades old.

Because those facilities pre-dated the call for tougher environmental standards many of them were unable to comply with new Environmental Protection Agency regulations regarding toxic emissions. Those regulations and even tougher ones being imposed by the Obama administration are expected to shutter even more coal-burning facilities in the next few years.

So while some elements of the mining industry are being negatively impacted by a cyclical downturn in the price of oil and should see a rebound once the oil prices bounce back, experts say thats not the case with coal.

The problem for the coal industry is that utility companies that convert natural resources into electricity and heat for homeowners are ditching coal as sentiment and economics have shifted away from the fossil fuel. Coal is increasingly being replaced by natural gas, found in vast stores in the U.S. and retrieved through the controversial process known as fracking, as well as through solar and wind power, although the latter two remain prohibitively costly. But that won't be the case forever.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Mr. Obama, words matter. Call the massacre of Mideast Christians what it is: Genocide",['Jay Sekulow'],"The images are horrific. Who can forget the video of masked Islamic jihadists on a beach beheading Christians -- executing them on-camera for the world to see?

And while there has been condemnation of the massacre of Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East, theres an important step the Obama administration must take to address this ongoing tragedy that has resulted in the slaughter or displacement of nearly one million Christians.

Words matter. And how we describe these atrocities is critical. Sure, these acts are barbaric, horrendous, and even monstrous.

But theres one word the Obama administration will not use to describe these atrocities. The White House  as well as the State Department  refuses to call these acts genocide.

The United Nations (UN) Genocide Convention defines genocide as acts committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group. That is certainly what is happening to Christians being executed by ISIS  the Islamic State  around the world.

But the word genocide carries with it important legal ramifications, too. Genocide violates international law and such a designation is necessary to activate certain legal requirements of the UN Genocide Convention that would force President Obama to protect Christians.

In short, all President Obamas talk about the slaughter of Christians doesnt require action. Labeling these heinous atrocities against Christians as genocide legally requires action. Dying Christians dont need more talk; they need action.

In a letter to Secretary of State Kerry, the American Center for Law and Justice outlined in-depth the legal arguments explaining why the United States, the U.N., and the rest of the international community must recognize this as genocide and act accordingly to stop it.

We have been working in the international community and here at home to underscore the importance of this official genocide designation.

We have filed legal documents with the U.N. and on Friday we will be presenting key oral statements there. We filed an amicus brief, including testimony from survivors of ISIS genocide, with the European Court of Human Rights. And we have seen positive results.

The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament has declared that ISIS is committing genocide against Christians.

Here at home, members of Congress understand whats at stake. The House Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously approved a bipartisan resolution last week that would officially label what ISIS is doing to Christians as genocide.

The resolution expresses the sense of Congress that all governments, including the United States ... should call ISIL atrocities by their rightful names: war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.

Many Americans understand the importance of acting now. In fact, weve heard from nearly 215,000 people urging the Obama administration to label the Middle East atrocities genocide.

However, the Obama administration refuses to act  refuses to embrace that language.

The White House continues to say that no determination has yet been reached with respect to labelling the ongoing massacre as genocide.

And Secretary Kerry continues to waffle. He recently told the House Appropriations Subcommittee that he is still reviewing the issue saying there must be additional evaluation done before a decision is made about using the designation.

Secretary Kerry, what are you waiting for? You have the facts. You see the carnage. Why is the Obama administration dragging its feet on this issue?

Some believe it goes directly to administrations philosophy and repeated refusal to identify the enemy as radical Islamic terrorism.

Consider this important exchange as reported by NBC News from that same recent Congressional hearing:

""The whole world knows Christians are being slaughtered in the Middle East,"" said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a California Republican and frequent critic of the Obama Administration. Rohrabacher also was not satisfied when Kerry said the greatest threat to the U.S. is ""violent extremism, radical religious extremism."" When Rohrabacher asked Kerry why he didn't use the words ""radical Islamic terrorism,"" Kerry quickly answered: ""It is predominantly Islamic and I have no hesitation in saying that.""

Heres what we know. As long as the Obama administration refuses to recognize the slaughter of Christians for what it is  genocide  the sad truth is that the United States is not doing everything in its power to protect the persecuted.

That must change. With the Obama administration facing a March 17th deadline for determining whether it will use the label, its time to send a powerful message to the president right now:

Mr. President, words matter. Call the ongoing massacre of Christians what it is  genocide  so the United States and the global community can provide them the vital legal protections they deserve.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Obama takes swipe at 'Republican crackup,' renews pressure on Senate over court pick",[],"President Obama took a swipe Thursday at what he called the Republican crackup happening in the GOP presidential primary race, while pushing back on the notion he may have contributed to the worsening tone of political rhetoric.

The president addressed the 2016 race during a joint press conference at the White House with visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Obama also used the forum to renew pressure on Senate Republicans to consider his eventual nominee to the Supreme Court vacancy.

But he scolded the party on several fronts, while reflecting on a question about whether he feels any responsibility for partisanship in Washington and on the campaign trail. On the 2016 race, he said Donald Trumps immigration positions arent all that different from those of the other candidates. And he said he actually wants to see an effective Republican Party in part to challenge blind spots in his own party.

But he also referred to the current state of affairs on the GOP primary trail as a circus and Republican crackup.

He also addressed the Supreme Court replacement process, while offering little in the way of hints as to whom he might pick.

Im going to do my job, and my expectation is going to be, will the Senate do its job? he said.

He said he hopes cooler heads will prevail"" and Republicans will back down from a plan to block a Supreme Court nominee.

He spoke as Republicans dug in on their resistance to any Obama nominee, as they argue the decision should be left to the next president.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said Democrats are only criticizing the strategy to score political points -- and efforts to change his mind are futile.

""I think we need to be crystal clear: It won't work,"" Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a 15-minute speech. He said Democratic blowback is ""all about using this process to score political points, it's that simple.""

As for whom Obama might pick, the president said only that he wants an outstanding jurist with impeccable legal credentials  and who, by historical standards, would not even be questioned as qualified for the court.

Yet his pool of potential picks has been shrinking in recent days, with several prominent individuals taking themselves out of the running, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

In his search for a replacement for the late Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, Obama is reported to be zeroing in on a small group of appellate court judges with largely traditional credentials and a history of bipartisan backing.

Obama's top tier of candidates include Judge Sri Srinivasan of U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Merrick Garland, chief judge on the same court, and Judge Paul Watford of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a source familiar with the selection process told the Associated Press. Ketanji Brown Jackson, a D.C. district court judge, is also under consideration, although a less likely option, said the source.

The Obama-Trudeau meetings Thursday in Washington marked the first official visit in nearly two decades by a Canadian prime minister, a charismatic and youthful liberal leader intent on tight ties with the United States.

At the ornate arrival ceremony on the South Lawn, Obama and first lady Michelle Obama welcomed Trudeau, the 44-year-old son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and his wife, Sophie Gregoire.

""There is no relationship in the entire world like the Canada-U.S. relationship,"" Trudeau said. ""We grew up together.""

Despite that close geographical and political alliance, no Canadian prime minister had made an official visit since 1997, a fact that Obama noted.

""It's about time, eh?"" Obama said, playing up the American stereotype of a Canadian colloquialism.

Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, with more than $2 billion worth of goods and services crossing the border every day. About 75 percent of Canada's exports go to the U.S.

Besides trade, the two leaders were expected to seek common ground on environmental protection. Before their meeting, the U.S. and Canada said in a statement that they will work to put in place an international agreement in Paris on curbing global warming. They committed to reducing methane emissions by 40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels over the coming decade.

Methane is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted in the U.S. from human activities and is much more efficient at trapping radiation than carbon dioxide.

Tall and fit, Justin Trudeau channels the charisma of his father. He aims to restore his father's legacy as leader of the Liberal Party, which was under siege during 10 years of Conservative rule under Stephen Harper, Trudeau's predecessor.

Harper's relations with Obama were strained over various issues, notably the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, which the Obama administration rejected last year. The American ambassador to Canada, Bruce Heyman, could not get a meeting with Harper or his Cabinet ministers for months.

But Trudeau's election in October ushered in a new era for Canada's politics that Trudeau, Heyman and others hope will help strengthen relations with the U.S.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Could you name the new most lethal stealth bomber in the world?,['Allison Barrie'],"Calling all U.S. Airmen ... do you have what it takes to name the militarys next stealth bomber?

For the first time, Air Force personnel have the chance to name a revolutionary, state-of-the-art aircraft - the first long-range stealth bomber of the 21st century.

The new stealth bomber joining the U.S. Air Force is expected to be a remarkable aircraft. In war, this new aircraft could fly deep into hostile areas  undetected  where it can unleash serious munitions against an enemy.

Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James threw down the challenge last month when she unveiled the first concept image of the bomber.

Related: Air Force unveils initial B-21 long range bomber design

This aircraft represents the future for our Airmen, and (their) voice is important to this process, James said. ""So we have an image, we have a designation, but what we don't yet have, we don't yet have a name.

This is where I'm challenging and I'm calling on every airman today ... to give us your best suggestions for a name for the B-21, America's newest bomber,"" she added.

Any Airman. whether Active, Guard, Reserve or civilian has a shot at naming an aircraft that will fly as part of the future fleet ensuring U.S. air dominance in war for the next generation.

What do we know about the ultra-secret stealth bomber?

There has been plenty of speculation about the new Long Range Strike Bomber, which has been shrouded in secrecy.

Related: New tech gives US helicopter pilots 'Superman-style' vision

Last fall the Pentagon announced that Northrop Grumman would be making the aircraft, which is intended to revolutionize stealth bombing.

Another big clue about plane came during a Super Bowl commercial, which featured a new aircraft that at one point was literally cloaked. Some industry experts believed this was a representation of Northrops vision for the new mysterious bomber, prompting a flurry of speculation on social media.

Now, the Pentagon has revealed the first rendering of the concept design. The Long Range Strike Bomber looks black and its zig-zag shape is fittingly futuristic. It wouldnt look out of place in the next Star Wars film.

The new stealth bombers designation is B-21, reflecting the fact it is the first bomber of the 21st century.

So what can this futuristic aircraft do?

The aircraft will be able to launch from the U.S. and attack any spot anywhere on the globe with unrivalled stealth and lethality.

Related: High-tech sponge can save lives in less than 20 seconds

The aircraft is expected to replace the nearly four-decades-old B-1 as well as the legendary B-52 Stratofortress that has served the country for about six decades.

The military has kept details of the wish list for its new bomber classified. However, the B-21 will inevitably be fully loaded with lots of technologies and next-gen innovations. It may even withstand nuclear weapon-generated electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) and still operate.

So who is making the new bomber?

On March 7, the Pentagon revealed even more details about the new plane.

Pratt & Whitney, a company that makes the F-35 engine, will build the B-21 engine.

The Air Force has also named six other companies who will help Northrop Grumman in building the rest of the bomber: BAE Systems, GKN Aerospace, Janicki Industries, Orbital ATK, Rockwell Collins and Spirit AeroSystems.

Related: Air Force, Marines, bolster air power with major Super Hercules deal

The B-21s path to creation is not without resistance. Developing a revolutionary Long Range Strike bomber does not come at a cheap price tag. It will have to duke it out for funding against other Air Force programs.

Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman, Sen. John McCain, also recently stated he would not authorize the B-21 if it was procured under a cost-plus contract.

Next Steps

The B-21 has moved into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase.

Interested Airmen should check in with the AF.mil website and the Air Forces social media accounts for updates on how to submit their ideas for a name. The name will be announced at the Air Force Association conference held Sept. 19 to 21 this year.

The new bomber will start deploying in the mid-2020s.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Years of taking popular diabetes drug tied to risk of B12 deficiency,[],"People taking metformin, a common type 2 diabetes medication, for several years may be at heightened risk of vitamin B12 deficiency and anemia, according to a new analysis of long-term data.

Metformin helps to control the amount of sugar, or glucose, in the blood by reducing how much glucose is absorbed from food and produced by the liver, and by increasing the body's response to the hormone insulin, according to the National Institutes of Health.

""Metformin is the most commonly used drug to treat type 2 diabetes, so many millions of people are taking it, usually for a prolonged period (many years),"" said senior study author Dr. Jill P Crandall of Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, by email.

""Smaller numbers of people take metformin for prevention of diabetes or treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome,"" Crandall told Reuters Health.

The researchers used data from the Diabetes Prevention Program and the Diabetes Prevention Program Outcomes Study, which followed participants at high risk for type 2 diabetes for more than 10 years.

The study began with more than 3,000 people age 25 years and older with high blood sugar. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either 850 milligrams of metformin twice daily, placebo medication or an intensive lifestyle program than did not include medication. For the new analysis only those taking placebo or metformin were considered, and about 50 participants were excluded after having weight-loss surgery, which would affect their diabetes outcomes.

During follow-up, the participants provided blood samples at the five- and 13-year points.

Using these blood samples, the researchers found that at year five, average B12 levels were lower in the metformin group than the placebo group, and B12 deficiency was more common, affecting 4 percent of those on metformin compared to 2 percent of those not taking the drug.

Borderline low B12 levels affected almost 20 percent of those on metformin and 10 percent of those taking placebo.

Average vitamin B12 levels were higher by year 13 than in year five, but B12 deficiency was also more common in both the metformin and placebo groups, as reported in the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism.

Vitamin B12 deficiency may lead to nerve damage which can be severe and may be irreversible, Crandall said.

""Severe and prolonged B12 deficiency has also been linked to impaired cognition and dementia,"" she said. ""It can also cause anemia (low red blood cell count) - fortunately, this condition is reversible with treatment.""

More people in the metformin group were also anemic at year five than in the placebo group.

There are more than three million cases of vitamin B12 deficiency each year in the U.S., which can be caused by diet or certain medical conditions. Symptoms include fatigue, and numbness or tingling.

Humans do not make vitamin B12 and need to consume it from animal sources or supplements. Vegetarians may get enough from eating eggs and dairy products, but vegans need to rely on supplements or fortified grains.

Doctors who prescribe metformin to patients long-term for type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes, polycystic ovarian syndrome or other indications should consider routine measurement of vitamin B12 levels, the authors conclude.

""The FDA and organizations such as the American Diabetes Association do not have any formal recommendations for B12 monitoring for people taking metformin,"" Crandall said. ""That said, our study (and others) suggests that a small but significant number of people may develop deficiency.""

""People who are taking metformin should ask their doctor about measuring their B12 level,"" she said.

Restoring healthy B12 levels is easy to accomplish with pills or monthly injections, she added.

""The risk of B12 deficiency should not be considered a reason to avoid taking metformin,"" Crandall said.",[]

Donald Trump gave an interview to Anderson Cooper last night that had some good sound for us to use today.

Rubio is struggling after disappointing results Tuesday night where he didnt get a single delegate. He apparently held a rally at a nearly empty stadium yesterday.

Rubio has not run a single campaign ad in Florida according to the Wall Street Journal which reports hes relied there on Super Pacs.

New Fox polling has more bad news for the Florida senator in his home states. It has Trump beating Rubio by 43 to 20% in the Sunshine state.

Marco Rubio told Megyn Kelly he regretted the tone of his attacks on Donald Trump. Hes backed away from vitriolic attacks against Donald Trump that now appear to have backfired.

Those Fox News polls have better news for John Kasich and his home state of Ohio. Kasich beats Trump 34 to 29% there according to our new polling. If Kasich wins Ohio, Donald Trump would need to get 59% of the remaining delegates to secure the nomination before the convention.

Still Donald Trump is the front runner riding momentum at this moment. Trip Gabriel writes today in the New York Times:

But Mr. Trump gained something even more valuable than delegates on Tuesday: momentum as the race heads into a watershed moment, March 15, when the first states that award delegates winner-take-all hold their primaries. They include Senator Marco Rubio's home state, Florida, and Gov. John Kasich's, Ohio. Both men have their backs to the wall, fighting for their political lives.

The Democrats had a lively debate hosted by Univision last night that focused on who would be more liberal on illegal immigration.

Clinton slammed Sanders over his votes during the financial collapse. Bernie accused Clinton of distorting his record. He also reiterated his claims that Clinton was indebted to Wall Street.

Host Jorge Ramos asked Hillary Clinton if she would drop out if she was indicted. She dismissed his question, Oh for goodness (sake), that is not going to happen. Im not even going to answer that question.

Heres how the Washington Post writer Dan Balz put it today Democrats got a taste Wednesday night of where their nominating contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders could be heading - toward a grueling and increasingly contentious battle that could continue until the primaries end in June. Sanders said his close victory in Michigan is evidence his message is resonating. But Clinton now has more delegates than Barack Obama did against her in 2008. She also has more than half the delegates needed to secure the nomination. 

Still, Sanders is likely to keep up the pressure all the way to the convention.

Hannah Kiresuk, 19, was diagnosed with juvenile refractory myasthenia gravis, a rare autoimmune disorder that has no cure. Shes undergone more than 30 surgeries and procedures, countless rounds of chemotherapy and has spent hundreds of long nights in the hospital. Through it all, her stuffed animal Hammy has been with her.

Hes been there for 300 nights in the hospital, almost two years of chemotherapy, 30-plus surgeries, Kiresuk told Fox 9. The toy had bandages, zip up sutures and medical tubes to represent each of Kiresuks procedure.

The cow toy went missing after it fell out of Kiresuks backpack in early March while she was attending a benefit held in her honor in Minneapolis, Fox 9 reported. She had used the skyway to pass the Target Center, home of the Timberwolves, and past the teams offices. While efforts to find Hammy fell short, the Wolves invited Kiresuk and her family to a March 8 matchup against the San Antonio Spurs at Target Center.

After a couple of days went by and Hammy hadnt been found, we decided to reach out and see if we could do something, not to replace Hammy  Hammy can never be replaced, but try to do something [to make it] a little less traumatizing for the family, Brad Ruiter, Timberwolves spokesman told Fox 9.

At the game Timberwolves guard Tyus Jones presented Kiresuk with a new companion, a stuffed dog which she named Wiggy after star player Andrew Wiggins.

Its nice to have moments where you dont remember youre sick, she told the news station.

While there is no cure for her disorder, the family is hopeful that a bone marrow transplant will allow Kiresuk to live a fuller life. They are currently fundraising to help cover costs.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-08 00:00:00,AG Lynch asks not to be considered for Supreme Court vacancy,[],"Attorney General Loretta Lynch has asked to not be considered for the Supreme Court vacancy given the urgent issues before the Department of Justice, a Justice Department official said Tuesday.

Lynch was among many names at the center of speculation over whom President Obama will nominate to fill the seat left by Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last month at age 79.

Justice Department spokeswoman Melanie Newman confirmed Tuesday that she does not want to be considered.

As the conversation around the Supreme Court vacancy progressed, the Attorney General determined that the limitations inherent in the nomination process would curtail her effectiveness in her current role, she said in a statement.

Given the urgent issues before the Department of Justice, she asked not to be considered for the position. While she is deeply grateful for the support and good wishes of all those who suggested her as a potential nominee, she is honored to serve as Attorney General, and she is fully committed to carrying out the work of the Department of Justice for the remainder of her term.

Lynch signaled as much last month, when she told Fox News she hadnt had any conversations with the president about the vacancy, adding she was extremely happy with her job.

Meanwhile, the White House continues to weigh its options, as Republicans vow to oppose any nominee  and call for Obama to defer to the next president to nominate a successor.

Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday that Republicans were ""acting like big, tough people threatening to destroy the reputation of a Supreme Court nominee they haven't even met yet.""

Reid and other Democrats denounced a comment by Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas, who told reporters late Monday that anyone nominated by Obama to the high court ""will bear some resemblance to a pinata.

""They don't know who the nominee is. They don't know anything about the person, but they already have in their mind they are going to beat this person like a pinata,"" Reid said.

Cornyn said Tuesday that his comparison was ""only to say the confirmation process around here has gotten pretty tough.""

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Could you name the new most lethal stealth bomber in the world?,['Allison Barrie'],"Calling all U.S. Airmen ... do you have what it takes to name the militarys next stealth bomber?

For the first time, Air Force personnel have the chance to name a revolutionary, state-of-the-art aircraft - the first long-range stealth bomber of the 21st century.

The new stealth bomber joining the U.S. Air Force is expected to be a remarkable aircraft. In war, this new aircraft could fly deep into hostile areas  undetected  where it can unleash serious munitions against an enemy.

Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James threw down the challenge last month when she unveiled the first concept image of the bomber.

Related: Air Force unveils initial B-21 long range bomber design

This aircraft represents the future for our Airmen, and (their) voice is important to this process, James said. ""So we have an image, we have a designation, but what we don't yet have, we don't yet have a name.

This is where I'm challenging and I'm calling on every airman today ... to give us your best suggestions for a name for the B-21, America's newest bomber,"" she added.

Any Airman. whether Active, Guard, Reserve or civilian has a shot at naming an aircraft that will fly as part of the future fleet ensuring U.S. air dominance in war for the next generation.

What do we know about the ultra-secret stealth bomber?

There has been plenty of speculation about the new Long Range Strike Bomber, which has been shrouded in secrecy.

Related: New tech gives US helicopter pilots 'Superman-style' vision

Last fall the Pentagon announced that Northrop Grumman would be making the aircraft, which is intended to revolutionize stealth bombing.

Another big clue about plane came during a Super Bowl commercial, which featured a new aircraft that at one point was literally cloaked. Some industry experts believed this was a representation of Northrops vision for the new mysterious bomber, prompting a flurry of speculation on social media.

Now, the Pentagon has revealed the first rendering of the concept design. The Long Range Strike Bomber looks black and its zig-zag shape is fittingly futuristic. It wouldnt look out of place in the next Star Wars film.

The new stealth bombers designation is B-21, reflecting the fact it is the first bomber of the 21st century.

So what can this futuristic aircraft do?

The aircraft will be able to launch from the U.S. and attack any spot anywhere on the globe with unrivalled stealth and lethality.

Related: High-tech sponge can save lives in less than 20 seconds

The aircraft is expected to replace the nearly four-decades-old B-1 as well as the legendary B-52 Stratofortress that has served the country for about six decades.

The military has kept details of the wish list for its new bomber classified. However, the B-21 will inevitably be fully loaded with lots of technologies and next-gen innovations. It may even withstand nuclear weapon-generated electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) and still operate.

So who is making the new bomber?

On March 7, the Pentagon revealed even more details about the new plane.

Pratt & Whitney, a company that makes the F-35 engine, will build the B-21 engine.

The Air Force has also named six other companies who will help Northrop Grumman in building the rest of the bomber: BAE Systems, GKN Aerospace, Janicki Industries, Orbital ATK, Rockwell Collins and Spirit AeroSystems.

Related: Air Force, Marines, bolster air power with major Super Hercules deal

The B-21s path to creation is not without resistance. Developing a revolutionary Long Range Strike bomber does not come at a cheap price tag. It will have to duke it out for funding against other Air Force programs.

Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman, Sen. John McCain, also recently stated he would not authorize the B-21 if it was procured under a cost-plus contract.

Next Steps

The B-21 has moved into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase.

Interested Airmen should check in with the AF.mil website and the Air Forces social media accounts for updates on how to submit their ideas for a name. The name will be announced at the Air Force Association conference held Sept. 19 to 21 this year.

The new bomber will start deploying in the mid-2020s.

Maybe that explains why you never hear anyone say they're going to a friend's house to ""Hulu and chill."" But that doesn't mean there are no worthy streaming alternatives.

Here are five services for people with a taste for something different. Many offer free plans and access via computers, mobile devices, smart TVs, and media players like Apple TV and Roku.

The other good news? It doesn't hurt to give these streaming services a try. Most offer free trials of two weeks to 30 days.

It also has some Criterion Collection gems, thanks to a deal with Hulu.

Available to subscribers on a PC or a Mac computer; Apple TV, Chromecast, and Roku streaming players; and some iOS and Android mobile devices.

Tubitv.com

If ""free"" and ""legal"" are words you'd love to see together in a streaming movie service pitch, then Tubi TV may be a revelation.

So writes a group of 31 international scientists and clinicians in an editorial in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, stating that ""substantial published evidence"" suggests such a link and calling on researchers elsewhere to take action.

They claim that some microbesthe virus and two types of bacteria, chlamydia and spirocheteare linked to the progressive neurological disease. ""We are saying there is incontrovertible evidence that Alzheimer's disease has a dormant microbial component,"" writes lead author Douglas Kell in a University of Manchester statement.

""We can't keep ignoring all of the evidence."" The authors propose that the named microbes ""reach the [central nervous system] and remain there in latent form."" They can then essentially wake up during the course of aging, under stress, or as the immune system declines.

""The consequent neuronal damage ... occurs recurrently, leading to ... ultimately AD,"" the authors posit. They point to the failure of 413 Alzheimer's drug trials conducted between 2002 and 2012 and ""express our concern that one particular aspect of the disease has been neglected,"" as ""antiviral/antimicrobial treatment of AD patients ... could rectify the 'no drug works' impasse."" Meanwhile, not all are convinced, with one neuroscience professor framing theirs as a ""minority view""; he tells the Telegraph there has ""been no convincing proof of infections causing"" the disease.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Failed ObamaCare co-ops have not repaid $1.2B in federal loans, docs say",['Rich Edson'],"EXCLUSIVE: The dozen failed ObamaCare cooperatives have not repaid any of the $1.2 billion in federal loans they received and still owe more than $1 billion in additional liabilities, according to recent financial statements cited Thursday at a congressional hearing.

We shouldnt hold our breath on repayment, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said in his opening statement at the hearing.

In some states, these losses will be absorbed by other insurance companieswhich means, by the policyholders of other insurance companies who have to pay increased ... premiums, he said. In other states, doctors, hospitals and individual patients stand to suffer large out-of-pocket losses due to the co-op failuresas our report details.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

Portmans statement, first obtained by Fox News, refers to an investigation by the committees majority staff.

It claims the most recent balance sheets provided to the subcommittee show the failed cooperatives owe more than $700 million to doctors and hospitals for plan year 2015.

The failed cooperatives lost $376 million and exceeded the projected worst-case-scenario losses outlined in their loan applications by more than $260 million in 2014. They lost an additional billion dollars in 2015, according to the report.

Once the co-ops got going in 2014, things went south in a hurryboth in terms of financial losses and enrollment figures that wildly deviated from the co-ops own projections, Portman said. Despite getting regular reports that the co-ops were hemorrhaging cash, HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] took essentially no corrective action for over a year.

Deloitte Consulting initially granted the cooperatives a passing grade based on an HHS-designed grading scale. However it added seven of the 12 had serious deficiencies in their enrollment strategy, according to the report. Others submitted budgets that were incomplete, unreasonable, not cost-effective and several relied on unreasonable projections about their own growth.

The report cited in Portmans statement also claims that from 20142015, the administration lent an additional $848 million to the failed cooperatives, as they lost more than $1.4 billion.

In previous testimony, administration officials have told congressional panels that the administration scrutinized cooperative business plans and then placed them on corrective oversight when necessary.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

In 2015 we conducted 27 financial and operational reviews, 16 in-person visits, and had 43 formal communications, Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, told the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year. Not to mention hundreds of phone calls. And we've kept the states up to speed on every important interaction to help inform their regulatory actions.

When questioned how much money the government could salvage from the failed cooperatives, officials said they were only beginning to determine amounts.

We are in the process of recouping that loan money right now, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the chief operating officer and chief of staff of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, last month to a House panel. Well look at their excess revenue and then use all the tools available to us through their loan agreements and state and federal law to pull back federal tax dollars.

ObamaCare provided $2.4 billion in federal loans to establish 23 non-profit cooperatives. A dozen failed and the administration has required eight of the remaining eleven to adhere to a corrective action plan designed to fix business flaws and prevent additional failures. The closed cooperatives account for $1.2 billion in federal loans.

Defenders of the law and cooperatives say these non-profit insurers operated in difficult markets and that it often takes years of financial commitment to build a viable business.

The failed cooperatives left hundreds of thousands of customers searching for a new insurance company. In some states, the loss was significant.

HHS gave the New York co-op $90 million to prolong its financial life, rather than allow it to scale down, that co-op went on to lose another $544 million in 2015, according to Portmans statement, citing his staffs report.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner in the Democratic presidential delegate count, pledged she would address the market void left by the failed cooperatives.

We need to get more companies, more nonprofits, to fill this space. The ones that knew what they were doing have provided good services, but a lot of them have failed because they didn't have the right support, she said Monday at a Democratic presidential forum hosted by Fox News.

Even in those markets where those co-ops had previously operated, we have seen a commitment on the part of those who are administering the markets to try to facilitate greater competition, said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. And creating the co-ops was just one way to do that, but we certainly are going to be open to other ways to encourage other entities, private or public, to get engaged in this process.

When previously questioned by Congress, administration officials declined to forecast how many of the remaining cooperatives would survive this year.

The co-ops themselves are really the ones who are going to be the ones to determine whether or not they ultimately will be successful, said Cohen. They have a lot of work to do to rapidly mature their entities, their small businesses as you know and theyre still getting their foothold on this business.

I dont think it (my faith) has changed, I grew up going to church, she told FOX411 at the premiere for her film. The only difference is that I think I probably realized I needed to participate in it more and actually be reengaged and finding a church in my community instead of just going when I am home in West Virginia.

Garner plays Christy Beam, a mother whose daughter is miraculously cured from an incurable disease after falling. The film is based on the true story of Annabel Beam.

Garner, mother of three, said she realized she needed to live out her faith for her children, who were all baptized in West Virginia.

I just realized I was living [with faith] in my head and not modeling it for them.

However, the 43-year-old actress revealed to People that she is still getting comfortable talking about religion.

It has always been quietly a part of me, she told the mag. ""I'm still getting used to the idea of talking about it.""

Co-star Martin Henderson, who plays Garners husband in the film, gushed about working with the actress.

It was so easy, it was great! he said with a grin from ear to ear. Whenever you play a husband and wife you never know how its going to go and so much of it is chemistry and I think Im a little in love with heranybody that ever meets her man or woman probably feels that there is something so enigmatically beautiful and pure about her.

Garner, who last year announced her split from husband Ben Affleck, was able to take away a strong message of hope from her film.

I took so much away from doing this movie and one of those things its just hope and to be encouraged and to be inspired, she said. I am so inspired by the Beam family. I think one of those things I took away from the movie is getting to know the Beam family getting to know Kylie Rogers and getting to know Martin (Henderson).

We shouldnt hold our breath on repayment, Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said in his opening statement at the hearing.

In some states, these losses will be absorbed by other insurance companieswhich means, by the policyholders of other insurance companies who have to pay increased ... premiums, he said. In other states, doctors, hospitals and individual patients stand to suffer large out-of-pocket losses due to the co-op failuresas our report details.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

Portmans statement, first obtained by Fox News, refers to an investigation by the committees majority staff.

It claims the most recent balance sheets provided to the subcommittee show the failed cooperatives owe more than $700 million to doctors and hospitals for plan year 2015.

The failed cooperatives lost $376 million and exceeded the projected worst-case-scenario losses outlined in their loan applications by more than $260 million in 2014. They lost an additional billion dollars in 2015, according to the report.

Once the co-ops got going in 2014, things went south in a hurryboth in terms of financial losses and enrollment figures that wildly deviated from the co-ops own projections, Portman said. Despite getting regular reports that the co-ops were hemorrhaging cash, HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] took essentially no corrective action for over a year.

Deloitte Consulting initially granted the cooperatives a passing grade based on an HHS-designed grading scale. However it added seven of the 12 had serious deficiencies in their enrollment strategy, according to the report. Others submitted budgets that were incomplete, unreasonable, not cost-effective and several relied on unreasonable projections about their own growth.

The report cited in Portmans statement also claims that from 20142015, the administration lent an additional $848 million to the failed cooperatives, as they lost more than $1.4 billion.

In previous testimony, administration officials have told congressional panels that the administration scrutinized cooperative business plans and then placed them on corrective oversight when necessary.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

In 2015 we conducted 27 financial and operational reviews, 16 in-person visits, and had 43 formal communications, Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, told the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year. Not to mention hundreds of phone calls. And we've kept the states up to speed on every important interaction to help inform their regulatory actions.

When questioned how much money the government could salvage from the failed cooperatives, officials said they were only beginning to determine amounts.

We are in the process of recouping that loan money right now, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the chief operating officer and chief of staff of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, last month to a House panel. Well look at their excess revenue and then use all the tools available to us through their loan agreements and state and federal law to pull back federal tax dollars.

ObamaCare provided $2.4 billion in federal loans to establish 23 non-profit cooperatives. A dozen failed and the administration has required eight of the remaining eleven to adhere to a corrective action plan designed to fix business flaws and prevent additional failures. The closed cooperatives account for $1.2 billion in federal loans.

Defenders of the law and cooperatives say these non-profit insurers operated in difficult markets and that it often takes years of financial commitment to build a viable business.

The failed cooperatives left hundreds of thousands of customers searching for a new insurance company. In some states, the loss was significant.

HHS gave the New York co-op $90 million to prolong its financial life, rather than allow it to scale down, that co-op went on to lose another $544 million in 2015, according to Portmans statement, citing his staffs report.

Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner in the Democratic presidential delegate count, pledged she would address the market void left by the failed cooperatives.

We need to get more companies, more nonprofits, to fill this space. The ones that knew what they were doing have provided good services, but a lot of them have failed because they didn't have the right support, she said Monday at a Democratic presidential forum hosted by Fox News.

Even in those markets where those co-ops had previously operated, we have seen a commitment on the part of those who are administering the markets to try to facilitate greater competition, said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest. And creating the co-ops was just one way to do that, but we certainly are going to be open to other ways to encourage other entities, private or public, to get engaged in this process.

When previously questioned by Congress, administration officials declined to forecast how many of the remaining cooperatives would survive this year.

The co-ops themselves are really the ones who are going to be the ones to determine whether or not they ultimately will be successful, said Cohen. They have a lot of work to do to rapidly mature their entities, their small businesses as you know and theyre still getting their foothold on this business.

On the projects website, the team said that users often blame bandwidth for slow page loading, but often, it has nothing to do with bandwidth at all.

The complication lies in the browsers need to sometimes fetch and evaluate additional objects, called dependencies.

As an example, a browser might have to execute a files JavaScript code in order to discover more images to fetch and render, wrote the team. The problem is that browsers cant actually see all of these dependencies because of the way that objects are represented by HTML (the standard format for expressing a webpages structure). As a result, browsers have to be conservative about the order in which they load objects, which tends to increase the number of cross-network trips and slow down the page load.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Obama takes swipe at 'Republican crackup,' renews pressure on Senate over court pick",[],"President Obama took a swipe Thursday at what he called the Republican crackup happening in the GOP presidential primary race, while pushing back on the notion he may have contributed to the worsening tone of political rhetoric.

The president addressed the 2016 race during a joint press conference at the White House with visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Obama also used the forum to renew pressure on Senate Republicans to consider his eventual nominee to the Supreme Court vacancy.

But he scolded the party on several fronts, while reflecting on a question about whether he feels any responsibility for partisanship in Washington and on the campaign trail. On the 2016 race, he said Donald Trumps immigration positions arent all that different from those of the other candidates. And he said he actually wants to see an effective Republican Party in part to challenge blind spots in his own party.

But he also referred to the current state of affairs on the GOP primary trail as a circus and Republican crackup.

He also addressed the Supreme Court replacement process, while offering little in the way of hints as to whom he might pick.

Im going to do my job, and my expectation is going to be, will the Senate do its job? he said.

He said he hopes cooler heads will prevail"" and Republicans will back down from a plan to block a Supreme Court nominee.

He spoke as Republicans dug in on their resistance to any Obama nominee, as they argue the decision should be left to the next president.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said Democrats are only criticizing the strategy to score political points -- and efforts to change his mind are futile.

""I think we need to be crystal clear: It won't work,"" Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a 15-minute speech. He said Democratic blowback is ""all about using this process to score political points, it's that simple.""

As for whom Obama might pick, the president said only that he wants an outstanding jurist with impeccable legal credentials  and who, by historical standards, would not even be questioned as qualified for the court.

Yet his pool of potential picks has been shrinking in recent days, with several prominent individuals taking themselves out of the running, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

In his search for a replacement for the late Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, Obama is reported to be zeroing in on a small group of appellate court judges with largely traditional credentials and a history of bipartisan backing.

Obama's top tier of candidates include Judge Sri Srinivasan of U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Merrick Garland, chief judge on the same court, and Judge Paul Watford of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a source familiar with the selection process told the Associated Press. Ketanji Brown Jackson, a D.C. district court judge, is also under consideration, although a less likely option, said the source.

The Obama-Trudeau meetings Thursday in Washington marked the first official visit in nearly two decades by a Canadian prime minister, a charismatic and youthful liberal leader intent on tight ties with the United States.

At the ornate arrival ceremony on the South Lawn, Obama and first lady Michelle Obama welcomed Trudeau, the 44-year-old son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and his wife, Sophie Gregoire.

""There is no relationship in the entire world like the Canada-U.S. relationship,"" Trudeau said. ""We grew up together.""

Despite that close geographical and political alliance, no Canadian prime minister had made an official visit since 1997, a fact that Obama noted.

""It's about time, eh?"" Obama said, playing up the American stereotype of a Canadian colloquialism.

Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, with more than $2 billion worth of goods and services crossing the border every day. About 75 percent of Canada's exports go to the U.S.

Besides trade, the two leaders were expected to seek common ground on environmental protection. Before their meeting, the U.S. and Canada said in a statement that they will work to put in place an international agreement in Paris on curbing global warming. They committed to reducing methane emissions by 40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels over the coming decade.

Methane is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted in the U.S. from human activities and is much more efficient at trapping radiation than carbon dioxide.

Tall and fit, Justin Trudeau channels the charisma of his father. He aims to restore his father's legacy as leader of the Liberal Party, which was under siege during 10 years of Conservative rule under Stephen Harper, Trudeau's predecessor.

Harper's relations with Obama were strained over various issues, notably the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, which the Obama administration rejected last year. The American ambassador to Canada, Bruce Heyman, could not get a meeting with Harper or his Cabinet ministers for months.

But Trudeau's election in October ushered in a new era for Canada's politics that Trudeau, Heyman and others hope will help strengthen relations with the U.S.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Can bright light at night lead to obesity?,[],"Reuters Health - Obesity rates may surge in places where artificial lights blaze all night compared to communities where people tend to live in darkness after the sun goes down, a recent study suggests.

To explore this connection, researchers analyzed U.S. military satellite images of nighttime illumination around the globe and country-level data from the World Health Organization (WHO) on the prevalence of overweight and obese people.

Artificial light at night contributed to excessive weight in men and women about as much as eating junk food, the research team reports in the International Journal of Obesity.

""Because of artificial light at night, we often eat in the wrong time, that is, after the natural dusk, when metabolic processes slow down,"" said N.A. Rybnikova of the University of Haifa in Israel.

The study doesn't prove light bulbs cause obesity, and scientists aren't yet certain how lamps or the glow from gadgets like tablets and televisions might influence how much people weigh, researchers caution.

But it's possible artificial light might contribute to obesity by suppressing the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep cycles.

These lights may also contribute to what's known as social jet lag, or disruption of the body's natural circadian rhythms that happens when people sleep and wake at times that are at odds with their internal biological clocks.

For women and men, higher birth rates appear to be one of the stronger predictors of excess weight and obesity.

Urbanization, as well as calorie intake of oils, fats and carbohydrates also appear to predict excessive weight in men and women alike. Consuming more roots and tubers was linked to a lower likelihood of excessive weight, the study also found.

Together with variables like eating habits and exercise levels, nighttime light explains up to about 73 percent of the variation in rates of excess weight and obesity in women and up to 68 percent in men, the study found.

The researchers also calculated overweight and obesity prevalence for different levels of ""Artificial Light-at-night,"" or ALAN, using a scale of zero to 1,000 ALAN (the highest observed level in 2010). They found that overweight and obesity rises with ALAN intensities, by 250 percent in most countries and 900 percent in Asia, at the highest light levels compared to the lowest.

The study builds on earlier research linking excessive weight to the use of tiny screens and other sources of light in bedrooms at night, the authors note.

""The evidence that exposure to artificial light at night is associated with metabolic disturbances is continuing to accumulate,"" said Laura Fonken, a researcher at the University of Colorado who wasn't involved in the study.

""Overall, it seems that there aren't any downsides to trying to keep a consistent sleep schedule and avoid nighttime light exposure,"" Fonken added by email.

Just turning off smartphones and tablets and dimming the lights at night probably won't help with weight loss, cautioned Illa Karatsoreos, of the Sleep and Performance Research Center at Washington State University in Pullman.

""But if these things are disrupting your normal patterns of sleep, and disrupted sleep is contributing to the problem, then these steps would help,"" Karatsoreos, who wasn't involved in the study, added by email.

""Anything to improve one's 'sleep hygiene' like reducing light and noise at night should help improve sleep quality, and this may help your body work more efficiently,"" Karatsoreos added.

""We seem to be finally waking up to the realization that disrupted sleep and biological rhythms are associated with many health problems, including metabolic disruption, obesity, and cardiovascular disease,"" Karatsoreos said.",[]

The southern part of the state was bracing for heavy rain later in the day.

Sixteen Louisiana parishes have declared a state of emergency, and the National Guard was sent in to help.

Guard spokesman Rebekah Malone says the Guard evacuated 361 people from homes in Bossier, Ouachita and Morehouse parishes since Wednesday morning, using trucks that can travel though water 20 to 30 inches deep.

Besides the people rescued, Malone says guardsman have evacuated 70 dogs, 16 chickens and even a guinea pig.

In Bossier City -- across the Red River from Shreveport -- some 3,500 homes were under a mandatory evacuation as a precaution because a bayou was approaching the top of its levee. National Weather Service meteorologist Jason Hansford said Thursday morning that the bayou may top the levee or be breached.

""A weather spotter just north of Monroe reported 18.1 inches of rain since Tuesday night,"" Hansford said.

Dozens of people were at a Red Cross shelter at the Bossier Civic Center in northwest Louisiana.

""About 50 people are in the shelter now and more are on the way from the area south of Bossier City, where several subdivisions were cut off by high water,"" shelter manager Colleen Morgan said.

""The Red Cross is providing food, a place to sleep and blankets for those at the center,"" Morgan said.

Lt. Bill Davis of the Bossier Parish Sheriff's Office said the road leading to an area just south of Bossier City is block by water in both directions. Authorities are using high-water vehicles to bring out about 1,000 people Thursday morning.

""Once they reach safety, buses will take them to the civil center,"" Davis said.

Rescuers were working out of a staging area along Highway 71 in Bossier Parish on Thursday. Using boats and trucks high enough to drive through the water, they went through the community evacuating people from their homes.

The rain, while sometimes light and sometimes hard, showed little sign of letting up. Many residents brought with them dogs and cats as they fled. Two men could be seen in knee-deep water trying to secure horses in the muddy brown waters.

State police report several sections of Interstate 20 were closed from Bossier City to near Gibsland in north central Louisiana.

Rain also pummeled parts of Oklahoma, Texas, Tennessee and Arkansas.

In southern Arkansas, heavy rainfall has prompted the closure of some schools and roads, and forecasters say the deluge will continue there for the rest of the week. Meteorologists with the National Weather Service say officials have reported water rescues and evacuations near Dermott, Arkansas as water rises in low-lying areas.

More than 14 inches of rain had fallen as of Thursday morning in Chicot and Ashley counties in the southeast corner of Arkansas. Meteorologist Ed Tarver says the service issued an extreme flood threat for the counties because up to five more inches could be coming today.

Officials say schools are shutting down early and roads are closed in parts of West Tennessee due to flooding caused by heavy rain.

One weather-related drowning was reported in both Oklahoma and Texas earlier this week. In Louisiana, authorities said a man died and a woman was being treated for injuries after their car was swept off a flooded Louisiana road Wednesday in Bienville Parish and into a creek.

Nearly a foot of rain fell Tuesday night into Wednesday in Louisiana, prompting scores of rescues.

Shawn Powell, his wife, and two children, ages 7 and 10, their dog and guinea pig left their home in the Pecan Grove subdivision early Thursday morning in the back of a National Guard truck.

Powell said he watched a Bossier Parish sheriff's deputy remove his neighbors across the street from their home in a boat Wednesday afternoon.

""At 2 a.m. (Thursday) as the water approached my house, I knew it was time to go,"" Powell said.

""As we were traveling out of the neighborhood, I didn't realize how bad it was,"" Powell said. ""The water was up to roofs of homes and you could see the tops of cars.""

Powell, his family and the pets were taken to the Red Cross shelter at the civic center.

""We brought with us a change of clothes and that's all,"" Powell said.

The people spoke to The Associated Press on Thursday on condition of anonymity because the Jets had not announced the signings.

After spending his first eight NFL seasons in Chicago, Forte will likely replace the departed Chris Ivory as the starter in the Jets' backfield. Forte, a two-time Pro Bowl selection, ranks second in Bears history to Hall of Famer Walter Payton in several categories, including yards rushing.

Robinson, coming off a broken leg suffered last November, rushed for 766 yards and eight TDs in three seasons with New Orleans.

Powell set a career high with 47 receptions for 388 yards and two touchdowns last season.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Can bright light at night lead to obesity?,[],"Reuters Health - Obesity rates may surge in places where artificial lights blaze all night compared to communities where people tend to live in darkness after the sun goes down, a recent study suggests.

To explore this connection, researchers analyzed U.S. military satellite images of nighttime illumination around the globe and country-level data from the World Health Organization (WHO) on the prevalence of overweight and obese people.

Artificial light at night contributed to excessive weight in men and women about as much as eating junk food, the research team reports in the International Journal of Obesity.

""Because of artificial light at night, we often eat in the wrong time, that is, after the natural dusk, when metabolic processes slow down,"" said N.A. Rybnikova of the University of Haifa in Israel.

The study doesn't prove light bulbs cause obesity, and scientists aren't yet certain how lamps or the glow from gadgets like tablets and televisions might influence how much people weigh, researchers caution.

But it's possible artificial light might contribute to obesity by suppressing the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep cycles.

These lights may also contribute to what's known as social jet lag, or disruption of the body's natural circadian rhythms that happens when people sleep and wake at times that are at odds with their internal biological clocks.

For women and men, higher birth rates appear to be one of the stronger predictors of excess weight and obesity.

Urbanization, as well as calorie intake of oils, fats and carbohydrates also appear to predict excessive weight in men and women alike. Consuming more roots and tubers was linked to a lower likelihood of excessive weight, the study also found.

Together with variables like eating habits and exercise levels, nighttime light explains up to about 73 percent of the variation in rates of excess weight and obesity in women and up to 68 percent in men, the study found.

The researchers also calculated overweight and obesity prevalence for different levels of ""Artificial Light-at-night,"" or ALAN, using a scale of zero to 1,000 ALAN (the highest observed level in 2010). They found that overweight and obesity rises with ALAN intensities, by 250 percent in most countries and 900 percent in Asia, at the highest light levels compared to the lowest.

The study builds on earlier research linking excessive weight to the use of tiny screens and other sources of light in bedrooms at night, the authors note.

""The evidence that exposure to artificial light at night is associated with metabolic disturbances is continuing to accumulate,"" said Laura Fonken, a researcher at the University of Colorado who wasn't involved in the study.

""Overall, it seems that there aren't any downsides to trying to keep a consistent sleep schedule and avoid nighttime light exposure,"" Fonken added by email.

Just turning off smartphones and tablets and dimming the lights at night probably won't help with weight loss, cautioned Illa Karatsoreos, of the Sleep and Performance Research Center at Washington State University in Pullman.

""But if these things are disrupting your normal patterns of sleep, and disrupted sleep is contributing to the problem, then these steps would help,"" Karatsoreos, who wasn't involved in the study, added by email.

""Anything to improve one's 'sleep hygiene' like reducing light and noise at night should help improve sleep quality, and this may help your body work more efficiently,"" Karatsoreos added.

""We seem to be finally waking up to the realization that disrupted sleep and biological rhythms are associated with many health problems, including metabolic disruption, obesity, and cardiovascular disease,"" Karatsoreos said.",[]

Ted Cruz: Listen, Donald does well with voters who have relatively low information, who are not that engaged and who are angry and they see him as an angry voice. Where we are beating him is when voters get more engaged and they get more informed. When they inform themselves, they realize his record. Hes what theyre angry at.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,A guide to new stimulus measures from European Central Bank,[],"The European Central Bank has reached again for the monetary bazooka.

It took a series of steps Thursday to try to use its powers as the monetary authority for the euro to support the economy, which is facing headwinds from market turbulence and a growth slowdown in China.

Most of all, it wants to drive up inflation. Annual consumer price inflation is minus 0.2 percent in the countries that use the euro, far from the bank's goal of just under 2 percent.

Here's a quick look at what the ECB's 25-member governing council agreed to do and what it means.

___

MAIN REFINANCING RATE

The ECB cut its benchmark interest rate, the main refinancing rate, to zero from 0.05 percent.

This rate is what the ECB charges banks to borrow from the central bank, and steers the price of credit more broadly. The decrease to the interest rate is so small, and the rate was already so low, that the impact of the cut to zero is questionable.

___

DEPOSIT RATE

The ECB lowered the rate on deposits that commercial banks keep at the central bank to minus 0.40 percent from minus 0.30 percent.

In practice, this means banks have to pay even more to park their excess cash at the ECB. The reasoning behind the cut is to encourage banks to not leave their money unused in the ECB vaults, but to push them to lend it.

___

CHEAP LOANS FOR BANKS

The ECB will offer banks loans at zero interest, for as long as four years.

That's aimed at giving banks long-term financial security. The money also is tied to incentives to loan more.

Giving banks financial support helps offset fears that the negative deposit rate will hurt their profits. In fact, if a bank lends enough to companies, it could see the interest rate reduced to as low as minus 0.4 percent. That means the ECB would be paying the bank to borrow from the central bank.

___

MORE BOND PURCHASES

The ECB increased its monthly bond purchases to 80 billion euros ($87 billion) from 60 billion euros.

The ECB has since last year been buying government and some extra-safe private-sector bonds with newly created money  something it can do as the legal issuer of the euro.

Increasing the amount of money in the financial system hopefully should increase lending and drive up inflation.

The ECB also added corporate bonds to the list of assets it can purchase.",[]

In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals said North Carolina can issue license plates bearing the statement ""Choose Life."" The General Assembly in 2011 passed legislation allowing the anti-abortion expression while rejecting requests to also issue tags saying ""Respect Choice"" or similar abortion-rights phrases.

The same appeals court two years ago had said the General Assembly's actions discriminated against differing viewpoints and was unconstitutional. That was before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a Texas case last year that specialty license plates represented government speech, allowing Texas to reject a proposal for tags featuring a Confederate battle flag.

The Supreme Court ordered the Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court to reconsider the North Carolina case in light of its decision on the Texas tags.

""We now conclude that specialty license plates issued under North Carolina's program amount to government speech and that North Carolina is therefore free to reject license plate designs that convey messages with which it disagrees,"" Chief Judge William Traxler wrote in the appeals court's majority decision.

North Carolina native and appeals court Judge James Wynn dissented, saying the other two judges were misreading the implications of the Supreme Court's Texas case. He said expressions on license plates aren't purely the government's expression of messages it approves. Legislators themselves recognized that the tags were intended to be a forum for private expression by the people who buy them.

""A person who sees a North Carolina ""I'd Rather Be Shaggin""' specialty plate during Monday morning rush hour surely does not routinely and reasonably believe that such a plate embodies the State of North Carolina's credo,"" Wynn wrote. ""Nor is it likely that a North Carolina Libertarian who applies for a ""Don't Tread On Me"" specialty plate is motivated by a desire to convey to the public the government's seal of approval.""

The Supreme Court's decision must have recognized that allowing officials alone to determine government speech would allow it ""to discriminate against disfavored speakers and messages at will,"" Wynn wrote. It's implausible that ""the Supreme Court meant to force us to choose that the mule in this case is either a horse or a donkey.""

The legal fight has blocked the state Division of Motor Vehicles from producing the ""Choose Life"" tags.

The American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina, which sued to block the ""Choose Life"" plates, issued a statement urging the General Assembly to allow pro-abortion rights supporters to also express themselves.",[]

Inspired by the way barnacles cling to the hull of a ship, The Cliff House was designed by Australian architectural firm Modscape that is known for working with prefabricated houses. According to BBC News, the vertical villa has three bedrooms (just one bathroom), an open air spa and space to barbecue on the ground floorwhich is closest to the ocean.

The design also calls for a unique entry. The roof of the house, which would sit level with the ground, has a car port that would lower residents down into a concealed garage on the top floor.

""The home is visualized as a natural extension of the cliff face rather than an addition to the landscape, creating an absolute connection with the ocean,"" said Modscape in a statement.

The design was created based on the wishes of clients that asked designers for an idea on how to build a home amidst the extreme parcels of coast in Victoria, Australia.

If you have fear of heights, fear of falling and vertigo this home may not be for you. Interior views make you feel like you're floating above the sea.

For the first time, Air Force personnel have the chance to name a revolutionary, state-of-the-art aircraft - the first long-range stealth bomber of the 21st century.

The new stealth bomber joining the U.S. Air Force is expected to be a remarkable aircraft. In war, this new aircraft could fly deep into hostile areas  undetected  where it can unleash serious munitions against an enemy.

Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James threw down the challenge last month when she unveiled the first concept image of the bomber.

Related: Air Force unveils initial B-21 long range bomber design

This aircraft represents the future for our Airmen, and (their) voice is important to this process, James said. ""So we have an image, we have a designation, but what we don't yet have, we don't yet have a name.

This is where I'm challenging and I'm calling on every airman today ... to give us your best suggestions for a name for the B-21, America's newest bomber,"" she added.

Any Airman. whether Active, Guard, Reserve or civilian has a shot at naming an aircraft that will fly as part of the future fleet ensuring U.S. air dominance in war for the next generation.

What do we know about the ultra-secret stealth bomber?

There has been plenty of speculation about the new Long Range Strike Bomber, which has been shrouded in secrecy.

Related: New tech gives US helicopter pilots 'Superman-style' vision

Last fall the Pentagon announced that Northrop Grumman would be making the aircraft, which is intended to revolutionize stealth bombing.

Another big clue about plane came during a Super Bowl commercial, which featured a new aircraft that at one point was literally cloaked. Some industry experts believed this was a representation of Northrops vision for the new mysterious bomber, prompting a flurry of speculation on social media.

Now, the Pentagon has revealed the first rendering of the concept design. The Long Range Strike Bomber looks black and its zig-zag shape is fittingly futuristic. It wouldnt look out of place in the next Star Wars film.

The new stealth bombers designation is B-21, reflecting the fact it is the first bomber of the 21st century.

So what can this futuristic aircraft do?

The aircraft will be able to launch from the U.S. and attack any spot anywhere on the globe with unrivalled stealth and lethality.

Related: High-tech sponge can save lives in less than 20 seconds

The aircraft is expected to replace the nearly four-decades-old B-1 as well as the legendary B-52 Stratofortress that has served the country for about six decades.

The military has kept details of the wish list for its new bomber classified. However, the B-21 will inevitably be fully loaded with lots of technologies and next-gen innovations. It may even withstand nuclear weapon-generated electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) and still operate.

So who is making the new bomber?

On March 7, the Pentagon revealed even more details about the new plane.

Pratt & Whitney, a company that makes the F-35 engine, will build the B-21 engine.

The Air Force has also named six other companies who will help Northrop Grumman in building the rest of the bomber: BAE Systems, GKN Aerospace, Janicki Industries, Orbital ATK, Rockwell Collins and Spirit AeroSystems.

Related: Air Force, Marines, bolster air power with major Super Hercules deal

The B-21s path to creation is not without resistance. Developing a revolutionary Long Range Strike bomber does not come at a cheap price tag. It will have to duke it out for funding against other Air Force programs.

Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman, Sen. John McCain, also recently stated he would not authorize the B-21 if it was procured under a cost-plus contract.

Next Steps

The B-21 has moved into the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase.

Interested Airmen should check in with the AF.mil website and the Air Forces social media accounts for updates on how to submit their ideas for a name. The name will be announced at the Air Force Association conference held Sept. 19 to 21 this year.

The new bomber will start deploying in the mid-2020s.

Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, has said that if you are white, ""you don't know what it's like to be poor.""

He should drive some of the roads I've driven in West Virginia, among other places. Some of the homes of the white poor look like throwbacks from an earlier time.

Sanders attempted to ""clarify"" his comment (a political synonym for walking it back when it didn't play well) during a town hall meeting Monday night in Detroit. Fox News anchor Bret Baier asked him about his remark and Sanders replied, ""I know about white poverty. There is no candidate in this race who has talked more about poverty than I have.""

Therein lies the problem. The left talks a lot about poverty, but when it comes to programs and ideas to help people climb out of poverty their only solution is to spend more money. If money alone were enough to extricate people from poverty and help them sustain themselves with a job and a strong family, then the more than $1 trillion spent on anti-poverty programs since the Great Society was launched by President Johnson in 1964 would have reduced the number of poor people in America. And yet, the poverty rate changes very little. A rational person might conclude that spending more money on programs that have failed to achieve their stated goals is not the right answer.

In April and May of 1964, President Johnson and the first lady, Lady Bird Johnson, toured the Appalachian states. After their visit he vowed to wipe out poverty. He didn't and his successors haven't either.

What do I, a now ""prosperous"" white guy, know about poverty?

In 1965, I was a private first class in the U.S. Army, working at Armed Forces Radio in New York City for the astronomical wage of $99 a month. All of us enlisted men had second jobs to make ends meet. Mine was as an engineer at WOR-TV. I had no car, the subway was 10 cents (soon to jump to 15 cents, producing cries from the left that it would harm the poor). I had no savings and as one payday approached I had only a dime in my pocket for a one-way trip to work. Had the paycheck not arrived, I had no idea how to get home to our little apartment in Elmhurst, Queens. Hitchhiking in New York City was not an option.

What I did have was incentive. I did not accept my poverty status as the final verdict on a young life. To paraphrase the song, if I couldn't make it in America, I couldn't make it anywhere. And so I kept at it until my Army discharge and then I moved back to Washington where I finished college, worked at a civilian media job and persisted until breaks came.

While poverty does not have simple solutions, there are solutions. They begin with relaying stories to the poor about people who used to be in their situation but liberated themselves from a life of want and need by making the right life choices. Inspiration and hope do not come from government. They come from within. They also come from churches, more of which can and should ""adopt"" a poor family and help them move out of poverty.

""You gotta have hope, mustn't sit around and mope,"" says the song from the musical ""Damn Yankees."" Where does anyone hear that in our blame, envy and entitlement political discourse?

Where have you gone Horatio Alger? Our nation turns its lonely eyes to you.

Steve Burton, 30, had been swimming naked in a nearby river and decided to dry off in a home alongside the river that he apparently believed he owned, Stuart Roberts, the chief of the Pendleton Police, told FoxNews.com.

Burton entered the home -- which was unlocked -- and found Gail Wilson, a former corrections officer who has muscular dystrophy. Burton, who did not know the woman, reportedly said, Hi, honey.

He had this big grin on his face, Wilson told The East Oregonian. He came walking toward me with his arms open wide. I kept saying, Get away from me! Get out of my house!

Related Image Expand / Contract (Steven Burton was charged with burglary, harassment, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.)

After the brief exchange, Burton made his way around the home, Roberts said. Wilson, in the meantime, alerted police and officers arrived to find Burton -- who was still in the buff -- standing outside.

The suspect made a run for it and scaled the property's fence, Roberts said. One problem: there was precious little space between the cliff and a 40-foot drop to the river. Burton stumbled and ended up falling over.

Responding officers did not hear a splash or any sounds normally associated with an impact. When they investigated, they found Burton hanging by his right foot wedged between the branches of the tree, Roberts said.

It took a group of rescuers three hours to remove Burton from the tree. Throughout the entire ordeal, the suspect remained combative and verbal with the officers, Roberts said. When he was removed from the tree and was on a skiff, he grabbed a deputys gun, but was stopped by other officers.

He was combative the entire time, Roberts said.

Burton is currently being held in a local jail.

Clinton is correct that when she began using the private email system in 2009, federal law did not explicitly prohibit doing so.

But her own department warned its employees against the use of private email to conduct government business because it could compromise classified materials and be subject to hacking.

Clinton herself signed a cable in 2011 sent to diplomatic and consular posts advising that State Department employees should avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Scientists find 'good' cholesterol can sometimes be bad,[],"So-called ""good"" cholesterol may actually increase heart attack risks in some people, researchers said on Thursday, a discovery that casts fresh doubt on drugs designed to raise it.

High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is generally associated with reduced heart risks, since it usually offsets the artery-clogging effects of the low density (LDL) form.

But some people have a rare genetic mutation that causes the body to have high levels of HDL and this group, paradoxically, has a higher heart risk, scientists reported in the journal Science.

""Our results indicate that some causes of raised HDL actually increase risk for heart disease,"" said lead researcher Daniel Rader of the University of Pennsylvania. ""This is the first demonstration of a genetic mutation that raises HDL but increases risk of heart disease.""

The scientists found that people with the mutation had an increased relative risk of coronary heart disease almost equivalent to the risk caused by smoking.

Normally, HDL is an important helper in the smooth running of the cardiovascular system by ferrying cholesterol to the liver, where it is eliminated.

But this process is disrupted in people with a faulty version of a gene known as SCARB1, leading to high levels of HDL that fails to do its job, Rader and colleagues found. The mutation appears to be specific to people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.

The finding could help explain why drugs that boost HDL have so far failed to deliver expected benefits in clinical trials.

Over the past decade, three experimental drugs known as CETP inhibitors from Pfizer, Roche and Eli Lilly have flopped in tests, leaving Merck's anacetrapib as the only one remaining in late-stage studies.

Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, which supported the research, said the new research had shed light on a major puzzle and could open up new medical avenues in the longer term.

""These unexpected findings pave the way for further research into the SCARB1 pathway to identify new treatments to reduce heart attacks in the future,"" he said in a statement.",[]

Steve Burton, 30, had been swimming naked in a nearby river and decided to dry off in a home alongside the river that he apparently believed he owned, Stuart Roberts, the chief of the Pendleton Police, told FoxNews.com.

Burton entered the home -- which was unlocked -- and found Gail Wilson, a former corrections officer who has muscular dystrophy. Burton, who did not know the woman, reportedly said, Hi, honey.

He had this big grin on his face, Wilson told The East Oregonian. He came walking toward me with his arms open wide. I kept saying, Get away from me! Get out of my house!

Related Image Expand / Contract (Steven Burton was charged with burglary, harassment, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.)

After the brief exchange, Burton made his way around the home, Roberts said. Wilson, in the meantime, alerted police and officers arrived to find Burton -- who was still in the buff -- standing outside.

The suspect made a run for it and scaled the property's fence, Roberts said. One problem: there was precious little space between the cliff and a 40-foot drop to the river. Burton stumbled and ended up falling over.

Responding officers did not hear a splash or any sounds normally associated with an impact. When they investigated, they found Burton hanging by his right foot wedged between the branches of the tree, Roberts said.

It took a group of rescuers three hours to remove Burton from the tree. Throughout the entire ordeal, the suspect remained combative and verbal with the officers, Roberts said. When he was removed from the tree and was on a skiff, he grabbed a deputys gun, but was stopped by other officers.

He was combative the entire time, Roberts said.

Burton is currently being held in a local jail.

In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals said North Carolina can issue license plates bearing the statement ""Choose Life."" The General Assembly in 2011 passed legislation allowing the anti-abortion expression while rejecting requests to also issue tags saying ""Respect Choice"" or similar abortion-rights phrases.

The same appeals court two years ago had said the General Assembly's actions discriminated against differing viewpoints and was unconstitutional. That was before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a Texas case last year that specialty license plates represented government speech, allowing Texas to reject a proposal for tags featuring a Confederate battle flag.

The Supreme Court ordered the Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court to reconsider the North Carolina case in light of its decision on the Texas tags.

""We now conclude that specialty license plates issued under North Carolina's program amount to government speech and that North Carolina is therefore free to reject license plate designs that convey messages with which it disagrees,"" Chief Judge William Traxler wrote in the appeals court's majority decision.

North Carolina native and appeals court Judge James Wynn dissented, saying the other two judges were misreading the implications of the Supreme Court's Texas case. He said expressions on license plates aren't purely the government's expression of messages it approves. Legislators themselves recognized that the tags were intended to be a forum for private expression by the people who buy them.

""A person who sees a North Carolina ""I'd Rather Be Shaggin""' specialty plate during Monday morning rush hour surely does not routinely and reasonably believe that such a plate embodies the State of North Carolina's credo,"" Wynn wrote. ""Nor is it likely that a North Carolina Libertarian who applies for a ""Don't Tread On Me"" specialty plate is motivated by a desire to convey to the public the government's seal of approval.""

The Supreme Court's decision must have recognized that allowing officials alone to determine government speech would allow it ""to discriminate against disfavored speakers and messages at will,"" Wynn wrote. It's implausible that ""the Supreme Court meant to force us to choose that the mule in this case is either a horse or a donkey.""

The American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina, which sued to block the ""Choose Life"" plates, issued a statement urging the General Assembly to allow pro-abortion rights supporters to also express themselves.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Utah lawmakers have until day's end to vote on death penalty,[],"Utah lawmakers are nearing their deadline to decide if they want to abolish the death penalty in the conservative state.

Thursday is the final day of the 2016 legislative session, and lawmakers have until midnight to vote.

The measure was originally considered a longshot in Utah's GOP-dominated Legislature, but it cleared the Senate and then squeaked through a House committee this week.

If it passes the full House, it will head to Republican Gov. Gary Herbert, who supports capital punishment and says he hasn't decided whether he'll sign it.

The debate comes amid a renewed national discussion about capital punishment.

A shortage of lethal-injection drugs in the U.S. in recent years has led several states to pass or consider laws to bring back other execution methods, such as electrocution. Last year, Utah lawmakers voted to reinstate firing squads as a backup method to ensure the state had a way to kill death row inmates if it couldn't get lethal-injection drugs.

Republican Sen. Steve Urquhart is leading the push to repeal capital punishment in the state. He argues the death penalty is costly and gives imperfect governments a godlike power over life and death.

Urquhart initially was doubtful of his proposal's chances because of the strong support for capital punishment in the state. But in recent weeks, he said he believed the libertarian-leaning Legislature would pass the measure.

Death penalty supporters argue Urquhart's repeal would leave prosecutors shortchanged at the bargaining table, where the possibility of execution helps them negotiate plea deals of life without parole.

Other critics said the death penalty is a just punishment for especially heinous crimes.

The bill would allow executions to go forward for the nine people on Utah's death row now but remove it as an option for any new convictions.

Utah is the only state in four decades to carry out executions by firing squad, with three such deaths since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.

State lawmakers stopped offering inmates the choice of the firing squad in 2004, saying the method attracted intense media interest and took away attention from victims. But they resurrected it last year, making the practice available for all death row inmates if lethal-injection drugs cannot be obtained 30 days before their execution.

Most Utah lawmakers are Mormon, but the firing-squad effort didn't seem linked to any teachings or doctrine from the Salt Lake City-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The Mormon church takes a neutral position on capital punishment.

Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have abolished capital punishment, and lawmakers, including Republicans, in more than half a dozen other states have suggested their states do the same.

Last year, Nebraska's Republican-controlled Legislature voted to abolish the death penalty over a veto from that state's GOP governor.

It became the first traditionally conservative state to eliminate the punishment since North Dakota dropped the practice in 1973. But death penalty supporters quickly launched a petition drive, leaving Nebraska voters to decide the issue this November.",[]

The justices effectively reversed an order by the federal appeals court in New Orleans that allowed Louisiana to begin enforcing its 2014 clinic regulation law even as it is being challenged in the courts.

The law requires doctors who provide abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals.

The legal group representing the clinics says facilities in Baton Rouge and Bossier City already have had to stop providing abortions and a clinic in Shreveport would have to stop providing abortions soon.

The justices' order, with only Justice Clarence Thomas noting his dissent, came two days after the court heard arguments in a major abortion case from Texas and just hours after the Supreme Court voted in a private meeting on the outcome of that case.

A vote for the clinics in Louisiana could signal that Justice Anthony Kennedy, whose vote is crucial to both sides, also will be a decisive fifth vote in favor of abortion clinics in Texas.

The cases are at different stages in the legal process, but they involve similar laws and actions by the same federal appeals court, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.

The appeals court was willing to let both states enforce the admitting privileges law. Additionally, the Texas law forces clinics to meet hospital-like standards for outpatient surgery.

The Supreme Court has previously put the Texas surgical center standards on hold, and cited that action in its order Friday. In 2013, however, the court split 5-4 in allowing Texas to require doctors to have hospital admitting privileges to perform abortions in clinics.

Opponents of the laws said half the 40 clinics that were open in Texas before the 2013 law closed as a result. There would be only 10 clinics left in the state if the Texas law were to be fully enforced.

Louisiana's law was struck down by a trial judge, but the appeals court said last week that the law could be enforced. Writing for a unanimous three-judge panel, Judge Jennifer Elrod rejected the clinics' argument that the appeals court should heed earlier Supreme Court action preventing Texas from fully implementing the regulations. The clinics contended that the Supreme Court is likely to side with the Texas clinics and would reverse any action against the Louisiana clinics.

But Elrod said the clinics ""misinterpret both the facts in our prior abortion cases and the Supreme Court's rulings.""

The Supreme Court, operating with eight justices since Justice Antonin Scalia's death last month, said Friday it was Elrod and her colleagues who got it wrong.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Why Donald Trump's foreign policy makes sense,['Peter Morici'],"Donald Trump could bring a welcome pragmatism to American foreign policy and something we have not seen in some timeprospects for genuine success.

He has yet to assemble an organized team of advisers. Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions is the only figure counseling Trump well known to the public and from the elite circles of foreign policy experts. His campaign website lacks a comprehensive statement of goals for foreign relations and the use of American power.

However, Trump's proposals on China and illegal immigration -- which closely parallel Mitt Romneys 2008 platform -- and positions toward Russia and the Middle East add up to a more coherent realism than has characterized the generally frustrated policies of President Obama.

President Clinton agreed to Chinas membership in the World Trade Organization in exchange for an agreement to open its markets to U.S. exports and investment.

That proved a terrible deal. Beijing still maintains much higher tariffs on U.S. products than are imposed on Chinese products here, subsidizes manufacturing by endlessly rolling over loans on money-losing state enterprises, and suppresses the value of the yuan to keep its exports cheap and American goods expensive in China.

American consumers enjoy artificially-inexpensive coffee makers at Wal-Mart but at a terrible hidden cost. Free trade destroys jobs when it admits additional imports but its supposed to create new jobs through the sale of more American goods and services abroad. With China that exchange has hardly balanced.

During Obamas tenure, the trade deficit with China has increased by about $100 billion. And it costs American workers some 800 thousand jobs directlyand more than 1.2 million jobs counting in those lost from those workers not spending lost wages domestically.

Trumps proposed tariff on imports to force China to revalue its currency and renegotiate its trade practices is hardly reckless. Similar measures have been proposed by liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman.

Illegal immigration at our southern border has vexed American presidents for generations, but the Mexican government has generally refused to cooperate in stemming that flow.

It is not acceptable to say in polite circles, even though absolutely true, that Mexico has one of the most corrupt governments among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developmentthe club of western industrialized countries.

The weight of graft keeps Mexico from providing citizens with adequate social services, clean drinking water and air, and decent wages driving them north in search of a better life. In turn, many Mexicans working here send sizeable remittances to relatives back home and that helps prop up a wanton regime.

As an advocate of NAFTA when proposed, like others, I hoped that a more open commercial relationship with the United States would propel reforms but that has failed.

Trump cant force Mexico City to build a wall along the border but by taxing remittances, Washington can pressure it to start cleaning up its filthy regime and genuinely cooperate in border control.

President Putin is asserting Russian power in Eastern Europe and the Middle East by among other things supporting Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad

American options for dealing with Russia and ISIS are limited by twin realities.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Scientists find 'good' cholesterol can sometimes be bad,[],"So-called ""good"" cholesterol may actually increase heart attack risks in some people, researchers said on Thursday, a discovery that casts fresh doubt on drugs designed to raise it.

High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is generally associated with reduced heart risks, since it usually offsets the artery-clogging effects of the low density (LDL) form.

But some people have a rare genetic mutation that causes the body to have high levels of HDL and this group, paradoxically, has a higher heart risk, scientists reported in the journal Science.

""Our results indicate that some causes of raised HDL actually increase risk for heart disease,"" said lead researcher Daniel Rader of the University of Pennsylvania. ""This is the first demonstration of a genetic mutation that raises HDL but increases risk of heart disease.""

The scientists found that people with the mutation had an increased relative risk of coronary heart disease almost equivalent to the risk caused by smoking.

Normally, HDL is an important helper in the smooth running of the cardiovascular system by ferrying cholesterol to the liver, where it is eliminated.

But this process is disrupted in people with a faulty version of a gene known as SCARB1, leading to high levels of HDL that fails to do its job, Rader and colleagues found. The mutation appears to be specific to people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent.

The finding could help explain why drugs that boost HDL have so far failed to deliver expected benefits in clinical trials.

Over the past decade, three experimental drugs known as CETP inhibitors from Pfizer, Roche and Eli Lilly have flopped in tests, leaving Merck's anacetrapib as the only one remaining in late-stage studies.

Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, which supported the research, said the new research had shed light on a major puzzle and could open up new medical avenues in the longer term.

""These unexpected findings pave the way for further research into the SCARB1 pathway to identify new treatments to reduce heart attacks in the future,"" he said in a statement.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Why Donald Trump's foreign policy makes sense,['Peter Morici'],"Donald Trump could bring a welcome pragmatism to American foreign policy and something we have not seen in some timeprospects for genuine success.

He has yet to assemble an organized team of advisers. Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions is the only figure counseling Trump well known to the public and from the elite circles of foreign policy experts. His campaign website lacks a comprehensive statement of goals for foreign relations and the use of American power.

However, Trump's proposals on China and illegal immigration -- which closely parallel Mitt Romneys 2008 platform -- and positions toward Russia and the Middle East add up to a more coherent realism than has characterized the generally frustrated policies of President Obama.

President Clinton agreed to Chinas membership in the World Trade Organization in exchange for an agreement to open its markets to U.S. exports and investment.

That proved a terrible deal. Beijing still maintains much higher tariffs on U.S. products than are imposed on Chinese products here, subsidizes manufacturing by endlessly rolling over loans on money-losing state enterprises, and suppresses the value of the yuan to keep its exports cheap and American goods expensive in China.

American consumers enjoy artificially-inexpensive coffee makers at Wal-Mart but at a terrible hidden cost. Free trade destroys jobs when it admits additional imports but its supposed to create new jobs through the sale of more American goods and services abroad. With China that exchange has hardly balanced.

During Obamas tenure, the trade deficit with China has increased by about $100 billion. And it costs American workers some 800 thousand jobs directlyand more than 1.2 million jobs counting in those lost from those workers not spending lost wages domestically.

Trumps proposed tariff on imports to force China to revalue its currency and renegotiate its trade practices is hardly reckless. Similar measures have been proposed by liberal New York Times columnist Paul Krugman.

Illegal immigration at our southern border has vexed American presidents for generations, but the Mexican government has generally refused to cooperate in stemming that flow.

It is not acceptable to say in polite circles, even though absolutely true, that Mexico has one of the most corrupt governments among members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developmentthe club of western industrialized countries.

The weight of graft keeps Mexico from providing citizens with adequate social services, clean drinking water and air, and decent wages driving them north in search of a better life. In turn, many Mexicans working here send sizeable remittances to relatives back home and that helps prop up a wanton regime.

As an advocate of NAFTA when proposed, like others, I hoped that a more open commercial relationship with the United States would propel reforms but that has failed.

Trump cant force Mexico City to build a wall along the border but by taxing remittances, Washington can pressure it to start cleaning up its filthy regime and genuinely cooperate in border control.

President Putin is asserting Russian power in Eastern Europe and the Middle East by among other things supporting Syrian strongman Bashar al-Assad

American options for dealing with Russia and ISIS are limited by twin realities. Led by Germany, Europeans are unwilling to put ground troops into harms way to help defend Eastern European freedom or combat ISIS. The American public, without such a European commitment, will surely not countenance American expeditionary forces to push Russia out of the Ukraine or to destroy ISIS.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Fact Check: Clinton stretches truth with debate email claims,[],"Hillary Clinton staunchly defended her use of a private email server during Wednesdays debate  but made some questionable claims about what was allowed.

Defending her use of a private email server, now the subject of an FBI investigation into whether it was improperly used for classified information, the former secretary of state said: ""It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed. ... I did not send or receive any emails marked classified at the time.

Here are the facts:

Clinton is correct that when she began using the private email system in 2009, federal law did not explicitly prohibit doing so.

But her own department warned its employees against the use of private email to conduct government business because it could compromise classified materials and be subject to hacking.

Clinton herself signed a cable in 2011 sent to diplomatic and consular posts advising that State Department employees should avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts.

Clinton further claims she didnt need permission to use private email because former Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice did so. However, neither Powell nor Rice conducted all government business on personal email, and neither set up a separate, personal server for that purpose.

Meanwhile, while Clinton says nothing was marked classified at the time, the 2009 Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) she signed in her early days as secretary of state confirmed that markings dont matter.

The NDA says classified information is marked and unmarked and includes verbal communications  leaving the responsibility to her to recognize classified information and report when it is outside secure channels.

And while Clinton maintained the emails were retroactively classified, sworn declarations from the CIA to the intelligence community inspector general say information included in the emails from the CIA was classified when it hit the Clinton server.

Clinton discussed the emails at Wednesday's Univision debate in Florida. She made similar comments during a Fox News-hosted town hall in Detroit on Monday.

In the year since Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department, the agency has since censored hundreds of those emails because they contained classified materials.

And when Clinton agreed last March to turn over ""all"" of her emails to the State Department and urged their release, she acted only after her aides had combed through all of her private emails, withholding messages that they deemed to be personal.

Those decisions weren't made by federal records specialists who normally decide which materials need to be turned over.

But now another billionaire New Yorker is putting up his own millions to prevent Trump from winning the presidency and is calling on Latinos to be part of that effort.

Financier George Soros is launching, along with other donors, a $15 million campaign to achieve the largest Latino and immigrant participation at the polls, the New York Times reported.

Through a new super PAC named Immigrant Voters Win, the campaign is funding organizations in states such as Florida, Nevada and Colorado, which have large or growing Latino and Asian communities, in the hope of influencing turnout in November, the Times reported.

Trump shot to the front of the Republican presidential field last year by proposing a hard-line immigration policy. The Hungarian-born Soros is contributing $5 million of his own money to the campaign.

People involved in the effort told the Times that it is the largest Democratic-voter turnout effort campaign to target Latinos and immigrants. The goal is to have a minimum of 400,000 new voters by the general election in November.

This is really taking the gloves off, said Cristobal Alex, the president of the Latino Victory Project, which is part of the campaign.

From the first day [Trump] attacked us, he called us rapists and thieves, Alex told the Times. We could have a giant wall built and millions of families broken apart. The country is on the precipice.

Trump, political experts generally agree, has turned the presidential race into one like no other in recent history. A billionaire who never has held political office, his candidacy was greeted with skepticism last year, with many considering his campaign a joke. Most analysts didn't give him much of a chance of winning the GOP nomination.

Instead Trump has cultivated a strong and, until now, loyal group of supporters who have gone to the primaries in large numbers. Televised GOP debate ratings have been high, something many experts attribute to the novelty of Trumps brash and unpredictable style. He consistently has ended up in the top slot of national polls of GOP voters and has won more primaries and caucuses than any of his GOP rivals.

Democratic voters, by contrast, seem far less enthusiastic, worrying many who want to stop Trumps march to the White House. Democratic debates, now including just former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have drawn much smaller audiences than the GOP ones, and Democratic primaries and caucuses also have had lower turnouts than their GOP counterparts.

Conservatives, to be sure, are hardly sitting by idly as Soros and Co. begin their Latino outreach.

Libre Initiative, which is in large part funded by the Koch brothers, reportedly is spending some $10 million to mobilize Latino turnout. The organizations approach is to have a grassroots presence in states where Latinos live in large numbers or where there is a fast-growing community.

The group promotes conservative principles while providing help to people obtaining driver's licenses or preparing for GED exams, among other things.

Trump wasted no time in laying out his hard-line immigration proposals. When he announced he was running for president, he condemned Mexico for dumping its worst citizens, as he put it, on the U.S. He vowed to build a wall along the border and to have a kind of deportation army that would track down and remove the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the United States.

Soros told the Times in an email that he had been rattled by what he viewed as the xenophobic tone of the Republicans running for president. He was upset by the call by Trump and others to ban Muslim refugees from the United States.

Soros has a long history of contributing millions to liberal political causes, and pockets don't get much deeper than his. He ranked No. 23 in the latest Forbes richest men list.

He told the Times, The intense anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric that has been fueled by the Republican primary is ... harmful to our democracy and to our national interests, Soros said. There should be consequences for the outrageous statements and proposals that weve regularly heard.

The Times said participants in the new campaign are responding to criticism by Latinos about the lack of financial support from wealthy liberals.

One reason we had lower turnout is because of historical underinvestment in our community, Alex said to the Times. Folks who want a progressive vision of the country have to match what is happening on the right. Now we are seeing a recognition by certain donors of the importance of our vote.

Serrano-Viterino was charged Wednesday with first-degree murder in the previous day's shooting death of 49-year-old Randy Nordman near New Florence, Missouri.

The visit was Anderson's first in free agency, making it a small victory for the Dolphins because he's being courted by other teams.

A three-year veteran, Anderson rushed for 720 yards last year for the Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos. They would have five days to match any offer from the Dolphins.

New Miami coach Adam Gase was offensive coordinator for the Broncos and Anderson in 2013-14. The Dolphins lost Miller when he agreed to a free-agent deal Wednesday with the Houston Texans.

So far this week the Dolphins have added defensive end Mario Williams, cornerback Byron Maxwell, linebacker Kiko Alonso, safety Isa Abdul-Quddus and tackle Sam Young. In addition to Miller, they lost defensive end Olivier Vernon, cornerback Brent Grimes and receiver Rishard Matthews.

Maxwell said he passed two physicals before the trade that sent him and Alonso to Miami from the Philadelphia Eagles was finalized. Maxwell missed the final two games last season with a shoulder sprain, and he acknowledged his health was a concern before the Dolphins approved the deal.

""The issue was the physical,"" he said. ""Everything is good now. I passed physicals both with Miami and Philadelphia, so I'm ready to go.""

As if to underscore his point, Maxwell was 15 minutes late for a conference call with reporters because he was working out.

Maxwell signed a $63 million, six-year contract to join the Eagles a year ago. He said he agreed to restructure that deal with the Dolphins but declined to give details.

Cook stressed the U.S. would keep ISIS detainees only for the ""short term,"" handled on a ""case by case"" basis. He did not say whether the U.S. could speak to detainees once they were turned over to Iraq.

U.S. special forces captured Sulayman Dawud al-Bakkar, also known as Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, in a raid last month in northern Iraq, according to Iraqi and U.S. officials. The special commando unit was deployed to Iraq to conduct raids and collect intelligence on the ground. The U.S. held him and questioned him for several weeks, but said he would eventually be turned over to the Iraqis.

Cook said the airstrikes conducted as a result of al-Bakkar's capture ""disrupted and degraded"" the group's chemical weapons capabilities, but did not necessarily eliminate the problem.

""We feel good about the damage we've done to the program,"" he said.

Cook declined to provide details of the strikes but said the information they've received will allow the U.S. to conduct additional strikes.

Al-Bakkar worked for the late President Saddam Hussein's now-dissolved Military Industrialization Authority, where he specialized in chemical and biological weapons. Iraqi intelligence officials said he is about 50 years old and headed the Islamic State group's recently established branch for the research and development of chemical weapons.

He was captured in a raid near the northern Iraqi town of Tal Afar, the officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

12:45 p.m.

Democrats are slowing down work in the Missouri Senate after Republicans broke up a 37-hour filibuster.

Democrats' rebellion Thursday comes after Republicans the day before used a rare procedural move to end a Democratic filibuster. Democrats were trying to block a proposal creating religious protections for those objecting to gay marriage.

The measure would prohibit government penalties against those who cite religious beliefs while declining to provide wedding-related services to same-sex couples. The religious protections would apply to clergy, religious organizations and some businesses such as florists and photographers.

The proposed constitutional amendment received initial approval Wednesday after a forced vote and is up for a final Senate vote.

Democrats in response made an unusual request Thursday for what amounted to a roughly 40-minute reading of the official record of recent Senate action.

_____

1:15 a.m.

The Missouri Senate could vote Thursday on whether to send the House a proposal creating religious protections for those objecting to gay marriage.

The Republican-led Senate gave initial approval early Wednesday to the proposed constitutional amendment after halting a Democratic filibuster that lasted 37 hours.

The measure would prohibit government penalties against those who cite religious beliefs while declining to provide wedding-related services to same-sex couples. The religious protections would apply to clergy, religious organizations and some businesses such as florists and photographers.

Another Senate vote is needed to send the measure to the House. Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard says that is likely to occur Thursday.

If passed by both chambers, the measure would appear on the ballot during either the August primary or November general election.",[]

According to a report by Bleacher Report, NFL teams are hesitant about picking up the 32-year-old due to the controversial nature of his wife, Miko Grimes.

Bleacher Report claims Miko was the primary reason the Dolphins chose to cut Grimes and subsequently release him, and the outlet said at least three NFL general managers said they would not sign Grimes because they do not want Miko around the team.

Miko went off in a series of vulgar tweets this week directed at reporters and Twitter critics alike. In one tweet Monday, she appeared to threaten Miami Herald writer Armando Salguero, writing, ""that fat [expletive] armando thinks he's safe from bullets bc we might be released is the funniest part of this whole things.""

Miko also criticized the Miami fanbase, saying it would ""always because mediocre bc the coverage is mediocre. U don't learn [expletive] from the writers down here.""

She downplayed talk that interest in her husband is low when she tweeted Thursday, ""any1 that has a problem w/me, feel free to @ me w/ur concerns so i can quietly block u. otherwise, stop disturbing me, business is BOOMING!""

Miko's Twitter account was made private as of Thursday afternoon.

This is not the first time Brent Grimes made headlines because of his wife. In September, Miko was arrested outside of Sun Life Stadium on charges of disorderly conduct, resisting arrest with violence and battery on a law enforcement officer. She stirred up controversy again in December when she took a verbal shot at Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill on Twitter after a loss to the Indianapolis Colts.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Ancient Roman tavern found littered with patrons' drinking bowls,[],"One of France's earliest-known Roman taverns is still littered with drinking bowls and animal bones, even though more than 2,000 years have passed since it served patrons, a new archaeological study finds.

An excavation uncovered dozens of other artifacts, including plates and bowls, three ovens, and the base of a millstone that was likely used for grinding flour, the researchers said.

The finding is a valuable one, said study co-researcher Benjamin Luley, a visiting assistant professor of anthropology and classics at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania. Before the Romans invaded the south of France, in 125 B.C., a culture speaking the Celtic language lived there and practiced its own customs. [See Photos of the Ancient Roman Tavern Discovered in France]

These Celtic people lived in densely settled, fortified sites during the Iron Age (750 B.C. to 125 B.C.), trading with cultures near and far, the researchers said. But after the Roman invasion, the Celtic culture at this location changed socially and economically, Luley said.

For instance, the new findings suggest that some people under the Romans stopped preparing their own meals and began eating at communal places, such as taverns.

""Rome had a big impact on southern France,"" Luley told Live Science. ""We don't see taverns before the Romans arrive.""

Tavern clues

The newly excavated tavern is located at Lattara, an archaeological site that's been known to modern researchers since the early 1980s. But Luley and his colleague Gae?l Pique?s, a researcher at the French National Center for Scientific Research, were specifically looking for artifacts dating to the end of the Iron Age, when the Romans arrived, the archaeologists said.

The researchers were in luck: The site they uncovered dates to about 125 B.C. to 75 B.C., spanning the period following the Roman conquest, and was located at the intersection of two important streets, the scientists said.

At first, the researchers weren't sure what to make of it. But a number of clues suggested the site was once a bustling tavern, one that likely served fish, flatbread, and choice cuts of cows and sheep, Luley said.

The excavated area includes a courtyard and two large rooms; one was dedicated to cooking and making flour, and the other was likely reserved for serving patrons, the researchers said.

There are three large bread ovens on one end of the kitchen, which indicates that ""this isn't just for one family,"" but likely an establishment for serving many people, Luley said. On the other side of the kitchen, the researchers found a row of three stone piles, likely bases for a millstone that helped people grind flour, Luley said.

""One side, they're making flour. On the other side, they're making flatbread,"" Luley said. ""And they're also probably using the ovens for other things as well."" For example, the archaeologists found lots of fish bones and scales that someone had cut off during food preparation, Luley added. [Photos: Mosaic Glass Dishes and Bronze Jugs from Roman England]

The other room was likely a dining room, the researchers said. The archaeologists uncovered a large fireplace and a bench along three of the walls that would have accommodated Romans, who reclined when they ate, Luley said. Moreover, the researchers found different kinds of animal bones, such as wishbones and fish vertebra, which people simply threw on the floor. (At that time, people didn't have the same level of cleanliness as some do now, Luley noted.)

The dining room also had ""an overrepresentation of drinking bowls,"" used for serving wine  more than would typically be seen in a regular house, he said.

Next to the two rooms was a courtyard filled with more animal bones and an offering: a buried stone millstone, a drinking bowl and a plate that likely held cuts of meat.

""Based upon the evidence presented here, it appears that the courtyard complex ... functioned as a space for feeding large numbers of people, well beyond the needs of a single domestic unit or nuclear family,"" the researchers wrote in the study. ""This is unusual, as large, 'public' communal spaces for preparing large amounts of food and eating together are essentially nonexistent in Iron Age Mediterranean France.""

Perhaps some of the people of Lattara needed places like the tavern to provide meals for them after the Romans arrived, Luley said.

""If they might be, say, working in the fields, they might not be growing their own food themselves,"" he said. And though the researchers haven't found any coins at the tavern yet, ""We think that this is a beginning of the monetary economy"" at Lattera, Luley said.

The study was published in the February issue of the journal Antiquity.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Thousands gather in Argentina to watch massive glacier collapse,[],"Argentina's massive Perito Moreno glacier this week began the process leading to its cyclical rupture, a spectacular event involving the collapse of huge masses of ice that draw thousands of tourists and that has not happened since 2012.

""The Perito Moreno Glacier began its breakup process. We're waiting! (We) came to experience it firsthand!,"" said the Tourism Secretariat of El Califate, a city some 80 km (50 mi.) from the glacier, Tuesday on Twitter.

Before the big show, a huge number of tourists and the news media began arriving at the Los Glaciares National Park in the southern province of Santa Cruz, which receives some 700,000 tourist each year.

""It's not known how long it's going to take. We only know from earlier experiences. In the last breakups starting from the moment when the outflow starts, which is what happened this morning, the process normally takes ... three or four days,"" park official Matilde Oviedo told EFE.

Pressure from the weight of the ice slowly pushes the glacier over the southern arm of Argentino Lake, damming that area and separating it from the rest of the lake. With no outlet, the water level in that closed-off lake section rises up to 30 meters (100 feet) above the level of the main body of Argentino Lake.

Every few years, the pressure produced by the height of the dammed water breaks through the ice barrier causing a spectacular rupture, sending a huge outpouring of water from the dammed-up section into the main lake area.

The most recent rupture was in March 2012 and the one before that was in 2008.

""Most (ruptures) ... have been at this time of year - at the end of the Southern Hemisphere's summer - but we've also had one in July (in winter). It's quite variable,"" Oviedo said.

Perito Moreno, which covers some 200 square kilometers (about 77 square miles), is located in the Andes, the natural border between Argentina and Chile and is one of the few glaciers in the world that is not receding due to global warming.

The glacier is located in the Southern Patagonian Ice Field, the third-largest concentration of fresh water ice in the world after the two poles.

Kasich's defenders say he has not raised taxes. They say he cut the state's overall tax burden by about $5 billion since becoming governor in 2011.

In fact, both are true. Kasich paid for across-the-board income-tax reductions by raising cigarette taxes and other sales taxes. The state's sales-tax rate rose to 5.75 percent from 5.5 percent in 2013.

Two years ago, a California startup named Aperia Technologies began selling a solution to this problem: the hub-mounted Halo Tire Inflator. Similar to a self-winding watch, it uses a pendulum-type weight to power a pump as the wheel its attached to turns. Set to a specific pressure, the device is connected to the tires valve stem via a hose and automatically increases or reduces pressure as needed. One Halo can serve up to two tires.

Along with preventing blowouts and increasing tire life, it improves fuel economy and reduces downtime for repairs, all of which adds up to $2,400 annual savings per truck, according to Aperia.

Thats exactly what it costs to install on an 18-wheeler, but its compatible with buses and heavy duty trucks with fewer axles, too. Aperia has sold thousands of systems since 2014 as it has built up its distribution network, but now its teaming up with Michelin to expand its reach dramatically.

The tire giant has begun offering the co-branded AutoInflate powered by Halo through its commercial services network for a monthly lease of about $15 a pop, and Aperia CEO Josh Carter expects its adoption to explode as it stops more tires from doing just that.

Carter says the company is focused on developing its U.S. market reach, but is also conducting several pilot programs overseas and has started looking into making a version for cars and light duty trucks.

And while a big selling point for the Halo is that it can be retrofitted to pretty much any truck, emissions rules being written for heavy duty trucks could include a bonus for the use of such systems, which would make them appealing to original equipment manufacturers, as well.

As for those gators, enjoy  and avoid  them while they last.

Cook stressed the U.S. would keep ISIS detainees only for the ""short term,"" handled on a ""case by case"" basis. He did not say whether the U.S. could speak to detainees once they were turned over to Iraq.

U.S. special forces captured Sulayman Dawud al-Bakkar, also known as Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, in a raid last month in northern Iraq, according to Iraqi and U.S. officials. The special commando unit was deployed to Iraq to conduct raids and collect intelligence on the ground.

Cook said the airstrikes conducted as a result of al-Bakkar's capture ""disrupted and degraded"" the group's chemical weapons capabilities, but did not necessarily eliminate the problem.

""We feel good about the damage we've done to the program,"" he said.

Cook declined to provide details of the strikes but said the information they've received will allow the U.S. to conduct additional strikes.

Al-Bakkar worked for the late President Saddam Hussein's now-dissolved Military Industrialization Authority, where he specialized in chemical and biological weapons. Iraqi intelligence officials said he is about 50 years old and headed the Islamic State group's recently established branch for the research and development of chemical weapons.

He was captured in a raid near the northern Iraqi town of Tal Afar, the officials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the matter publicly.

Steve Burton, 30, had been swimming naked in a nearby river and decided to dry off in a home alongside the river that he apparently believed he owned, Stuart Roberts, the chief of the Pendleton Police, told FoxNews.com.

Burton entered the home -- which was unlocked -- and found Gail Wilson, a former corrections officer who has muscular dystrophy. Burton, who did not know the woman, reportedly said, Hi, honey.

He had this big grin on his face, Wilson told The East Oregonian. He came walking toward me with his arms open wide. I kept saying, Get away from me! Get out of my house!

After the brief exchange, Burton made his way around the home, Roberts said. Wilson, in the meantime, alerted police and officers arrived to find Burton -- who was still in the buff -- standing outside.

The suspect made a run for it and scaled the property's fence, Roberts said. One problem: there was precious little space between the cliff and a 40-foot drop to the river. Burton stumbled and ended up falling over.

Responding officers did not hear a splash or any sounds normally associated with an impact. When they investigated, they found Burton hanging by his right foot wedged between the branches of the tree, Roberts said.

It took a group of rescuers three hours to remove Burton from the tree. Throughout the entire ordeal, the suspect remained combative and verbal with the officers, Roberts said. When he was removed from the tree and was on a skiff, he grabbed a deputys gun, but was stopped by other officers.

He was combative the entire time, Roberts said.

Burton is currently being held in a local jail.

The program, known as Polaris, decreases the time it takes for a webpage to load by 34 percent.

Related: Long-delayed plan to end US oversight of ICANN could finally take effect this year

The Polaris team includes graduate student Ameesh Goyal and professor Hari Balakrishnan, as well as Harvard professor James Mickens, who started project while he was a visiting professor at MIT in 2014.

On the projects website, the team said that users often blame bandwidth for slow page loading, but often, it has nothing to do with bandwidth at all. In order to load a page, browsers have to fetch objects such as images, source code and HTML files before adding the content to what the user sees. The complication lies in the browsers need to sometimes fetch and evaluate additional objects, called dependencies.

As an example, a browser might have to execute a files JavaScript code in order to discover more images to fetch and render, wrote the team. The problem is that browsers cant actually see all of these dependencies because of the way that objects are represented by HTML (the standard format for expressing a webpages structure). As a result, browsers have to be conservative about the order in which they load objects, which tends to increase the number of cross-network trips and slow down the page load.

Related: Department of Defense to test its cybersecurity with 'Hack the Pentagon' competition

Polaris cuts into this process by tracking the interactions and creating a dependency graph for the page.

To better understand Polaris in action, Mickens suggested the analogy of a travelling businessperson visiting city upon city without a list of each stop. If someone gave you the entire list of cities ahead of time, you could plan the fastest possible route. Without the list, though, you have to discover new cities as you go, which results in unnecessary zig-zagging between far-away cities, wrote the team.



For a web browser, loading all of a pages objects is like visiting all of the cities, said Mickens. Polaris effectively gives you a list of all the cities before your trip actually begins. Its what allows the browser to load a webpage more quickly.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,How to get your baby to sleep,[],"All parents know the difficulties involved with getting their children to have a good nights sleep. But Dr. Marc Weissbluth, a leading physician and author of Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child, told FoxNews.com that a lack of sleep can have a lasting effect on the health of the child and the entire family.

According to Weissbluth, there is a growing trend of children receiving less and less sleep, which can lead to behavioral, emotional and cognitive deficits.

Two-year-olds are sleeping about a half hour less than previous generations, Weissbluth said, later adding that this sleep deprivation can also weigh heavily on the child's mother.

He highlighted three studies by Dr. Harriet Hiscock that found a child's healthy sleep pattern can help prevent depression in mothers.

Keeping in mind the health risks and new parenting challenges that face millennial parents, Weissbluth released the fourth edition of his book which offers advice for parents who want to keep both themselves and their children happy and healthy.

Fathers are a secret weapon, Weissbluth said, adding that ""fathers can do lullaby's, massage, sing songs, rock the baby. They can do everything a mother can do except breast feed.""

Weissbluth also concluded that when fathers are involved in sleep-time rituals, there are fewer problems and the children sleep better.

Another tip is to make sure your children have many naps with intervals of no more than two hours between them. Weissbluth advises parents to put their baby down to sleep when they are drowsy but not fully asleep so they can learn to self-sooth. He warned that if parents keep their baby up too long, they may get a second wind, become overtired and will have trouble sleeping.

He also addressed the growing number of children with televisions in their bedroom, which he said can be a contributing factor to sleep deprivation. Over the past 30 years, the percentage of children with a TV in their bedroom grew from 10 percent to 75. About 20 percent of children under age 2 also have a TV in their bedroom.

""If you really want to stop the sleep problem get the TV out of the kids' bedroom,"" Weissbluth said.

He also said that parents whose children skip an occasional nap or have a rare troubled night's sleep should not be alarmed.

""We're not perfect,"" he said. ""Your children will be sleep deprived sometimes, but we want to void chronic sleep deficits.""",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Billionaire smackdown! George Soros funds effort to stop Trump, mobilize Latinos",[],"Donald Trump often notes that he has plenty of millions to battle his way to the Oval Office.

But now another billionaire New Yorker is putting up his own millions to prevent Trump from winning the presidency and is calling on Latinos to be part of that effort.

Financier George Soros is launching, along with other donors, a $15 million campaign to achieve the largest Latino and immigrant participation at the polls, the New York Times reported.

Through a new super PAC named Immigrant Voters Win, the campaign is funding organizations in states such as Florida, Nevada and Colorado, which have large or growing Latino and Asian communities, in the hope of influencing turnout in November, the Times reported.

Trump shot to the front of the Republican presidential field last year by proposing a hard-line immigration policy. The Hungarian-born Soros is contributing $5 million of his own money to the campaign.

People involved in the effort told the Times that it is the largest Democratic-voter turnout effort campaign to target Latinos and immigrants. The goal is to have a minimum of 400,000 new voters by the general election in November.

This is really taking the gloves off, said Cristobal Alex, the president of the Latino Victory Project, which is part of the campaign.

From the first day [Trump] attacked us, he called us rapists and thieves, Alex told the Times. We could have a giant wall built and millions of families broken apart. The country is on the precipice.

Trump, political experts generally agree, has turned the presidential race into one like no other in recent history. A billionaire who never has held political office, his candidacy was greeted with skepticism last year, with many considering his campaign a joke. Most analysts didn't give him much of a chance of winning the GOP nomination.

Instead Trump has cultivated a strong and, until now, loyal group of supporters who have gone to the primaries in large numbers. Televised GOP debate ratings have been high, something many experts attribute to the novelty of Trumps brash and unpredictable style. He consistently has ended up in the top slot of national polls of GOP voters and has won more primaries and caucuses than any of his GOP rivals.

Democratic voters, by contrast, seem far less enthusiastic, worrying many who want to stop Trumps march to the White House. Democratic debates, now including just former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have drawn much smaller audiences than the GOP ones, and Democratic primaries and caucuses also have had lower turnouts than their GOP counterparts.

Conservatives, to be sure, are hardly sitting by idly as Soros and Co. begin their Latino outreach.

Libre Initiative, which is in large part funded by the Koch brothers, reportedly is spending some $10 million to mobilize Latino turnout. The organizations approach is to have a grassroots presence in states where Latinos live in large numbers or where there is a fast-growing community.

The group promotes conservative principles while providing help to people obtaining driver's licenses or preparing for GED exams, among other things.

Trump wasted no time in laying out his hard-line immigration proposals. When he announced he was running for president, he condemned Mexico for dumping its worst citizens, as he put it, on the U.S. He vowed to build a wall along the border and to have a kind of deportation army that would track down and remove the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the United States.

Soros told the Times in an email that he had been rattled by what he viewed as the xenophobic tone of the Republicans running for president. He was upset by the call by Trump and others to ban Muslim refugees from the United States.

Soros has a long history of contributing millions to liberal political causes, and pockets don't get much deeper than his. He ranked No. 23 in the latest Forbes richest men list.

He told the Times, The intense anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric that has been fueled by the Republican primary is ... harmful to our democracy and to our national interests, Soros said. There should be consequences for the outrageous statements and proposals that weve regularly heard.

The Times said participants in the new campaign are responding to criticism by Latinos about the lack of financial support from wealthy liberals.

One reason we had lower turnout is because of historical underinvestment in our community, Alex said to the Times. Folks who want a progressive vision of the country have to match what is happening on the right. Now we are seeing a recognition by certain donors of the importance of our vote.

The proposal is part of an airline policy bill sponsored by Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., chairman of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, and Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., the committee's senior Democrat. It would extend the operating authority of the Federal Aviation Administration through Oct. 1, 2017. That authority is due to expire on March 31.

The bill would require the Department of Transportation develop a way to display fees that's easy for consumers to understand and require that airlines and ticket agents use the system. A report last year by the committee's Democratic staff found that airline fees, especially for things like ticket cancellations or changes, are often hidden from consumers while shopping fares online or disclosed in lengthy paragraphs of tiny type-face that's difficult to read.

Airlines would also have to return fees for bags that are lost or delayed more than six hours after the arrival of a domestic flight, and more than 12 hours after the arrival of an international flight under the bill. Airlines would also be required to automatically refund fees for services purchased but not received by passengers. Examples would include things like advance seat assignments that turn out to be unavailable or early boarding that isn't provided.",[]

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Fact Check: Clinton stretches truth with debate email claims,[],"Hillary Clinton staunchly defended her use of a private email server during Wednesdays debate  but made some questionable claims about what was allowed.

Defending her use of a private email server, now the subject of an FBI investigation into whether it was improperly used for classified information, the former secretary of state said: ""It was not prohibited. It was not in any way disallowed. ... I did not send or receive any emails marked classified at the time.

Here are the facts:

Clinton is correct that when she began using the private email system in 2009, federal law did not explicitly prohibit doing so.

But her own department warned its employees against the use of private email to conduct government business because it could compromise classified materials and be subject to hacking.

Clinton herself signed a cable in 2011 sent to diplomatic and consular posts advising that State Department employees should avoid conducting official Department business from your personal e-mail accounts.

Clinton further claims she didnt need permission to use private email because former Secretaries of State Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice did so. However, neither Powell nor Rice conducted all government business on personal email, and neither set up a separate, personal server for that purpose.

Meanwhile, while Clinton says nothing was marked classified at the time, the 2009 Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) she signed in her early days as secretary of state confirmed that markings dont matter.

The NDA says classified information is marked and unmarked and includes verbal communications  leaving the responsibility to her to recognize classified information and report when it is outside secure channels.

And while Clinton maintained the emails were retroactively classified, sworn declarations from the CIA to the intelligence community inspector general say information included in the emails from the CIA was classified when it hit the Clinton server.

Clinton discussed the emails at Wednesday's Univision debate in Florida. She made similar comments during a Fox News-hosted town hall in Detroit on Monday.

In the year since Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department, the agency has since censored hundreds of those emails because they contained classified materials.

And when Clinton agreed last March to turn over ""all"" of her emails to the State Department and urged their release, she acted only after her aides had combed through all of her private emails, withholding messages that they deemed to be personal.

Those decisions weren't made by federal records specialists who normally decide which materials need to be turned over.

foxnews.com,2016-03-07 00:00:00,Apple VP: FBI wants to 'turn back the clock' to less secure OS,[],"Two weeks ahead of a scheduled court date, Apple continues to publicly battle the FBI's request to unlock one of its iPhones. Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi on Sunday penned an opinion piece for the Washington Post, which suggests that compliance will set mobile security back at least three years.

The U.S. Justice Department, he said, believes security on iOS 7 was ""good enough,"" so Apple should roll back to the security level of that operating system.

""But the security of iOS 7, while cutting-edge at the time, has since been breached by hackers,"" Federighi wrote. ""What's worse, some of their methods have been productized and are now available for sale to attackers who are less skilled by often more malicious.""

Apple decided to encrypt its mobile operating system by default beginning with iOS 8, meaning device-level data is inaccessible even to Cupertino, so the company cannot turn over things like phone passcodes and iMessage chats to the feds.

But following a December terrorist attack in California, the government is itching to access an iPhone 5c issued to one of the shooters, Syed Rizwan Farook, by his employer, the San Bernardino Health Department.

The FBI wants Apple to create a new mobile operating system, which could disable a feature that wipes the gadget after 10 incorrect password guesses""intentionally creating a vulnerability that would let the government force its way into an iPhone,"" Federighi said.

""Once created, this softwarewhich law enforcement has conceded it wants to apply to many iPhoneswould become a weakness that hackers and criminals could use to wreak havoc on the privacy and personal safety of us all,"" he added.

The tech titan is even willing to take its fight against the FBI over iPhone backdoors all the way to the Supreme Court, where it would have the support of numerous industry heavyweights.

Oral arguments are set for March 22 in federal court.

Donald does well with voters who have relatively low information, who are not that engaged and who are angry and they see him as an angry voice. - GOP presidential contender Ted Cruz

Cruz also said Trump is taking advantage of his voters  which is roughly the same charge the GOP front-runner leveled at his Republican detractors during a Fox News town hall Wednesday night.

At the forum, Trump pushed back against what appears to be a growing movement among the party establishment  including a few of his former rivals  to at least slow march to the convention with enough delegates in hand to claim the nomination.

The billionaire businessman called his campaign a movement ""of competence and common sense and low taxes and [secure] borders and it would be so foolish to give it away.""

Trump was referring to a conference held by the conservative American Enterprise Institute at Sea Island off the coast of Georgia over the weekend, where one of the topics reportedly was stopping Trump from securing the Republican nomination.

The conference reportedly was attended by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other key Republican congressmen.

""I know all these people,"" Trump told Fox News Sean Hannity. ""These are people that are taking advantage of our country. They dont want to have strong borders. They want stuff flowing across the borders. They dont want to have taxation when countries treat us unfairly because they benefit from that.""

Cruzs comments about Trumps supporters comes ahead of another Republican debate Thursday night in Florida, the site of one of five big primaries next Tuesday. The stakes are higher than ever, as those five primaries could decide the fate of Trumps remaining rivals.

As Trump builds his delegate lead over the field following a string of wins earlier this week, Cruz is positioning himself as the one candidate who could actually beat Trump in the end  citing several primary and caucus victories, most recently in Idaho.

He was buoyed Wednesday by the endorsement of former candidate Carly Fiorina. And, speaking with Fox News Megyn Kelly, he said the other two candidates in the race  Marco Rubio and John Kasich  do not have a path to the nomination.

""Head-to-head, not only do I beat Donald Trump,"" Cruz said, ""but I defeat him resoundingly.""

Rubio is under tremendous pressure to win Florida next week, his home state. But a Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Rubio trailing Trump by 23 percentage points among likely Republican voters in Florida.

Rubio, though, told Kelly he has no intention of dropping out right now.

""I have never discussed dropping out with anyone on my team, or anyone on the planet Earth ... I'm the only one who can beat Donald Trump in Florida, he said.

Rubio also dismissed the possibility that he would form a so-called ""unity"" Republican ticket with Cruz, Trump's closest challenger in the delegate race, calling it "" the kind of drama that makes it interesting in TV to speculate about.""

""At some point we're all going to team up,"" Rubio said in reference to the non-Trump candidates. ""We're all going to be on the same team, I hope.

Former GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush also planned to meet with Trump's rivals on Thursday ahead of the GOP debate in Florida, fueling speculation that he's preparing to endorse a candidate challenging Trump.

Ohio Gov. Kasich, meanwhile, is vowing to win his home state next week. He told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren that he would ""probably not"" pick up enough delegates in other contests to overtake Trump, but noted that voters had only ""picked about half the delegates [so far] this year ... anything is possible.""

A Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Kasich leading Trump by five percentage points among likely Republican voters in the Buckeye State.",[]
foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Obama takes swipe at 'Republican crackup,' renews pressure on Senate over court pick",[],"President Obama took a swipe Thursday at what he called the Republican crackup happening in the GOP presidential primary race, while pushing back on the notion he may have contributed to the worsening tone of political rhetoric.

The president addressed the 2016 race during a joint press conference at the White House with visiting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Obama also used the forum to renew pressure on Senate Republicans to consider his eventual nominee to the Supreme Court vacancy.

But he scolded the party on several fronts, while reflecting on a question about whether he feels any responsibility for partisanship in Washington and on the campaign trail. On the 2016 race, he said Donald Trumps immigration positions arent all that different from those of the other candidates. And he said he actually wants to see an effective Republican Party in part to challenge blind spots in his own party.

But he also referred to the current state of affairs on the GOP primary trail as a circus and Republican crackup.

He also addressed the Supreme Court replacement process, while offering little in the way of hints as to whom he might pick.

Im going to do my job, and my expectation is going to be, will the Senate do its job? he said.

He said he hopes cooler heads will prevail"" and Republicans will back down from a plan to block a Supreme Court nominee.

He spoke as Republicans dug in on their resistance to any Obama nominee, as they argue the decision should be left to the next president.

Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley said Democrats are only criticizing the strategy to score political points -- and efforts to change his mind are futile.

""I think we need to be crystal clear: It won't work,"" Grassley, R-Iowa, said in a 15-minute speech. He said Democratic blowback is ""all about using this process to score political points, it's that simple.""

As for whom Obama might pick, the president said only that he wants an outstanding jurist with impeccable legal credentials  and who, by historical standards, would not even be questioned as qualified for the court.

Yet his pool of potential picks has been shrinking in recent days, with several prominent individuals taking themselves out of the running, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch.

In his search for a replacement for the late Associate Justice Antonin Scalia, Obama is reported to be zeroing in on a small group of appellate court judges with largely traditional credentials and a history of bipartisan backing.

Obama's top tier of candidates include Judge Sri Srinivasan of U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Merrick Garland, chief judge on the same court, and Judge Paul Watford of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a source familiar with the selection process told the Associated Press. Ketanji Brown Jackson, a D.C. district court judge, is also under consideration, although a less likely option, said the source.

The Obama-Trudeau meetings Thursday in Washington marked the first official visit in nearly two decades by a Canadian prime minister, a charismatic and youthful liberal leader intent on tight ties with the United States.

At the ornate arrival ceremony on the South Lawn, Obama and first lady Michelle Obama welcomed Trudeau, the 44-year-old son of the late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and his wife, Sophie Gregoire.

""There is no relationship in the entire world like the Canada-U.S. relationship,"" Trudeau said. ""We grew up together.""

Despite that close geographical and political alliance, no Canadian prime minister had made an official visit since 1997, a fact that Obama noted.

""It's about time, eh?"" Obama said, playing up the American stereotype of a Canadian colloquialism.

Canada is the United States' largest trading partner, with more than $2 billion worth of goods and services crossing the border every day. About 75 percent of Canada's exports go to the U.S.

Besides trade, the two leaders were expected to seek common ground on environmental protection. Before their meeting, the U.S. and Canada said in a statement that they will work to put in place an international agreement in Paris on curbing global warming. They committed to reducing methane emissions by 40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels over the coming decade.

Methane is the second most prevalent greenhouse gas emitted in the U.S. from human activities and is much more efficient at trapping radiation than carbon dioxide.

Tall and fit, Justin Trudeau channels the charisma of his father. He aims to restore his father's legacy as leader of the Liberal Party, which was under siege during 10 years of Conservative rule under Stephen Harper, Trudeau's predecessor.

Harper's relations with Obama were strained over various issues, notably the proposed Keystone XL oil pipeline, which the Obama administration rejected last year. The American ambassador to Canada, Bruce Heyman, could not get a meeting with Harper or his Cabinet ministers for months.

But Trudeau's election in October ushered in a new era for Canada's politics that Trudeau, Heyman and others hope will help strengthen relations with the U.S.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,"Under pressure to quit, Marco Rubio says hes not dropping out of race",['Bryan Llenas'],"For Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the headlines and the polls speak for themselves.

Rubio should quit the race, a Boston Globe opinion piece reads.

Sorry, Marco Rubio, its time to fold, a Washington Post piece declared.

The latest Fox News Poll, released less than a week before Floridas March 15th Republican primary, shows Donald Trump holding a dominating 23-point lead over Rubio in his home state  43 percent to 20 percent.

The poll appears to validate the Post opinion piece which said, There reaches a time in every campaign in which the only people who are convinced that the candidate has a legitimate chance to win is the candidate himself and the most loyal (or ambitious) aides.

But in a town hall meeting on Wednesday night on The Kelly File, with Fox News Host Megyn Kelly, Rubio maintained that he would not drop out of the race before Floridas primary  despite reports that he was thinking about it.

That is 100 percent categorically false, Rubio said. I have never discussed dropping out with anyone on my team or anyone on the planet Earth. Or anyone on any planet for that matter.

I am not dropping out of the race. We are going to fight this thing through Tuesday. We are going to win Florida. We are going to go on.

Rubio dodged the question about what would happen to his campaign if he loses Florida on Tuesday, although he admitted it wont be a good night if we dont win Florida.

He tried to downplay the fact that hes only won two contests so far, the Minnesota caucus and the Puerto Rico primary. Rubio reiterated that it didnt matter because it all comes down to Florida.

Id still have to win Florida, Rubio said. You cant be the Republican nominee if you dont win Florida. And I am going to do everything I can to win this state. These people here in this state have never given up on me. I am not going to give up on them.

Despite losing by 23 points in the latest poll, Rubio believes he could win Florida if voters choose not to vote for Senator Ted Cruz and Governor John Kasich, and instead coalesced around him.

A vote for them is a vote for Trump, because I am the only one that can beat Donald Trump in Florida, Rubio said. So even if you like John Kasich or Ted Cruz if you dont want Donald Trump to win Florida, you have to vote for me. I am the only one that has a reasonable chance of even beating him.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,This virtual brushing simulator may help us make better toothbrushes,[],"We take for granted that four out of five dentists agree when it comes to best toothpastes or superior toothbrushes (and that the fifth dentist is just asleep at the wheel, or something), but how much do we really know about what those recommendations are grounded upon? As it turns out, not much.

That's mostly because it's actually really hard to test the effectiveness of our dental hygiene tools. But now, researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials IWM in Freiburg, Germany have developed a virtual brushing simulator which may change how we look at our toothbrushes, and may help doctors really test out the effectiveness of our brushing tools.

The secret, the Institute says, is a novel simulation that actually allows researchers to determine just how much of that nasty film you're getting off your teeth in the morning and at night. ""With our procedure, manufacturers of dental hygiene products can determine the cleaning effectiveness of each individual parameter in a fast, economical and reliable manner,"" says IWM scientist Dr. Christian Nutto. ""Unlike in real-world experiments, the individual parameters in the simulation can be easily modified -- be it the size, shape, and quantity of abrasive particles in a toothpaste, or the material from which they are made, or the shape and elasticity of the bristles.""

For the first time, researchers will have an efficient way to determine how shape, stiffness, abrasiveness, and even toothpaste viscosity affect our teeth's enamel, and more importantly, the germs sitting atop our teeth. ""We can increase the scope of the experiments far beyond what is possible in real-world testing, and that makes a noticeable difference in the quality of the products,"" the Institute claims.

To conduct their simulations, Nutto says, ""We specify the characteristics for the abrasive particles such as density, shape and fill factor."" Then, the team virtually rubs a toothbrush bristle over the tooth, and scientists are able to visualize and quantify ""cleaning effectiveness, as well as the aggressiveness of the abrasives against the tooth enamel."" And according to their tests, this new simulation ""can precisely predict how the toothpaste and bristles will affect the tooth enamel. At a later stage, it will also be able to predict the effectiveness of the toothpaste and brush at removing the biofilm from teeth.""

So if you're looking for a way to test your toothbrush (or want researchers to just do a better job of it), thank the folks at the Fraunhofer Institute and their fancy toothbrush simulator.",[]

Miller scheduled Maggio's sentencing for March 24.

""Maggio was a Circuit Court Judge who essentially admitted that he sold his office by substantially reducing a jury verdict in exchange for campaign donations,"" Miller wrote. ""He stated several times that he understood his rights and the waivers associated with his plea.""

Prosecutors said in a filing last month that Maggio had violated his plea agreement by being uncooperative and failing a lie detector test when questioned about the campaign contributions. The former judge faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.

Miller asked attorneys in the case whether the bribery statute was correctly applied. Maggio's attorney James Hensley argued that the alleged bribe was not related to government business, which was required under the statute.

U.S. attorneys argued that as an elected actor of the state, Maggio's job as a judge was state business, regardless of whether his rulings were related to government actions.

The Associated Press left a message Thursday seeking comment from Hensley.

Maggio filed a motion Feb. 12 to withdraw his January 2015 plea to a charge that he had accepted campaign donations from an unnamed nursing home owner and a lobbyist in exchange for reducing a jury award in a negligence case involving one of the nursing home owner's facilities.

Maggio was accused of accepting the $50,000 donation two days before reducing the jury's $5.2 million award to $1 million. Prosecutors said the donation, which included $24,000 from the company's owner, was made in July 2013.

foxnews.com,2016-03-10 00:00:00,GOP senators caught in middle of 2016 chaos  and under pressure to take sides,['Chad Pergram'],"Lunch used to be a thing for lawmakers in Washington.

You could cab downtown to The Palm for a power lunch of steak au poivre and fried onions. Slide out the side door of the Dirksen Senate Office Building and across the parking lot to the legendary Monocle for braised lamb chops.

But sometimes, if youre a Republican senator, its simpler to just grab a bite with your GOP colleagues in the Mike Mansfield Room of the Capitol.

Yet even this is becoming a complicated media event thanks to the unpredictable presidential primary battle -- as reporters these days camp out in the Senate subway station, firing off a battery of questions to lunch-driven lawmakers about the apparent doom which supposedly looms for the Republican Party this year.

Donald Trump this. Ted Cruz that. Marco Rubio. Did someone say Kasich?

Major primaries in Ohio and Florida are on the horizon next week. The results could set the table for this campaign cycle. The House of Representatives isnt in session this week. So every reporter in Washington worth their byline made a beeline for the Capitol to query senators about the presidential race.

The hand-operated train which runs to the Russell Senate Office Building pulls in. Sens. Richard Burr, R-N.C., and John McCain, R-Ariz., pile out. Reporters flock to McCain. Both are up for re-election this year. Burr, despite representing a swing state, somehow escapes the crew and hoofs it upstairs to the weekly GOP luncheon, practically incognito.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.  often a target for a press gaggle on intelligence and firearm issues  walks by with barely a notice.

Democrats arent important this week. Only Republicans.

This weeks reporter scrums in the Senate subway station were intense.

Some are starting to suggest that Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, may be the only person who can short-circuit Donald Trump en route to the Republican nomination. And yet not a single GOP senator has endorsed their colleague. That phenomenon is practically unheard of in American politics.

There was a rumor four senators were going to endorse Ted Cruz, said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. But that rumor was unfounded.

Four senators. Zero senators. It doesnt seem to matter much. Republican senators dont like Ted Cruz  even if some grudgingly concede he may be the only person capable of defeating Trump. And not everyone is sure Cruz is better than Trump.

Collins believes Cruz needs a Dale Carnegie course.

Im not sure Ted has developed relationships in the Senate, said Collins. Some of his rhetoric toward the Republican leader has not been conducive.

Last summer, Cruz raged on the floor about Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., trade policy and an effort to renew the controversial Export-Import Bank.

I cannot believe that [McConnell] would tell a flat-out lie, steamed Cruz. We now know that when the majority leader looks us in the eyes and makes an explicit commitment that he is willing to say things that he knows are false.

Some Republicans  especially those in leadership or tenuous political positions  tried to take the high road with Cruz.

Teds a smart guy, said Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune, R-S.D. His tenure in the Senate has been him trying to be a disruptor.

And it was that disruption which seems to have turned off many of his Senate colleagues.

He was leading the government shutdown, said Collins. It was a disaster in every way.

Expectations were created that somehow we could win, echoed Thune of the shutdown.

Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., faced a competitive primary a few weeks ago. Republicans pumped significant monetary and human resources into the state at the end to close the deal for Shelby. Colleague Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., is the only senator to endorse Donald Trump. Shelby wasnt in much of a mood to talk shop Tuesday when a mob of reporters waited for him to disembark from the Senate trolley.

Im going to lunch right now, said Shelby brusquely brushing past the throng.

Things were almost as hectic on Wednesday as senators cruised past reporters from the subway station en route to a midday procedural vote. Only, there was no formal lunch planned this time. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., is also a vulnerable GOPer this cycle who hails from a swing state. But Johnson didnt feel accosted by reporters as he walked to one of the subways.

Im happy to answer questions, said Johnson. Or not answer, as the case may be.

He chuckled.

Would Trump or Cruz take a pragmatic approach to governing?

Im praying, replied Johnson.

Perhaps that means senators should say grace before lunch  regardless of where they decide to eat.

I dont think it (my faith) has changed, I grew up going to church, she told FOX411 at the premiere for her film. The only difference is that I think I probably realized I needed to participate in it more and actually be reengaged and finding a church in my community instead of just going when I am home in West Virginia.

Garner plays Christy Beam, a mother whose daughter is miraculously cured from an incurable disease after falling. The film is based on the true story of Annabel Beam.

Garner, mother of three, said she realized she needed to live out her faith for her children, who were all baptized in West Virginia.

I just realized I was living [with faith] in my head and not modeling it for them.

However, the 43-year-old actress revealed to People that she is still getting comfortable talking about religion.

It has always been quietly a part of me, she told the mag. ""I'm still getting used to the idea of talking about it.""

Co-star Martin Henderson, who plays Garners husband in the film, gushed about working with the actress.

It was so easy, it was great! he said with a grin from ear to ear. Whenever you play a husband and wife you never know how its going to go and so much of it is chemistry and I think Im a little in love with heranybody that ever meets her man or woman probably feels that there is something so enigmatically beautiful and pure about her.

Garner, who last year announced her split from husband Ben Affleck, was able to take away a strong message of hope from her film.

I took so much away from doing this movie and one of those things its just hope and to be encouraged and to be inspired, she said. I am so inspired by the Beam family. I think one of those things I took away from the movie is getting to know the Beam family getting to know Kylie Rogers and getting to know Martin (Henderson). It was such an intense experience that I know we will always be a part of each others lives.

Continue Reading Below

The YES Network has launched an ad campaign that urges Comcast Xfinity customers to switch pay-TV providers, as the two sides continue to battle over carriage fees. Newspaper, TV and billboard ads are warning Yankees fans that they could miss the start of the 2016 season if they subscribe to Comcast. The YES Network also set up a website that directs viewers to alternate cable and satellite companies in their area.

The YES Network, which also airs Brooklyn Nets games, went dark on Comcast in November amid a disagreement over how much Comcast should pay to carry the cable channel. The blackout is threatening to prevent Comcast customers in the New York area from watching the Yankees Opening Day game against the Houston Astros on April 4.

Comcast signed off on a preliminary agreement to continue carrying the network beyond the 2015 baseball season. However, the Philadelphia-based media giant revisited the deal after it scrapped a proposed merger with Time Warner Cable (TWC), the largest cable company in New York City. Comcast has argued that it cant justify the cost of keeping the YES Network, citing lower viewership in the baseball offseason.

In its new ad campaign, the YES Network emphasizes that it was the top-rated cable network in the New York area on Yankees game days.

This isnt like Comcast taking off the sewing channel, YES Network CEO Tracy Dolgin said Wednesday on The Michael Kay Show, an ESPN radio program that is simulcast on YES.

Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

In a statement, Comcast said it remains hopeful that it can bring back the YES Network, but only if the asking price comes down.

This dispute comes down to one reality: FOX and YES are demanding more than a 30% increase for a network that has very low viewership among our customers and which is already the most expensive RSN (regional sports network) in the country, Comcast said.

Twenty-First Century Fox (FOXA), the parent company of FOXBusiness.com, owns a majority stake in the YES Network.

The YES Network is the largest regional sports networks in the nation, according to SNL Kagan data. The 14-year-old network reaches roughly 9 million homes, and distributors pay roughly $5 a month per subscriber for the right to carry the YES Network. The channel was available to approximately one million Comcast homes in New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania.

The fight between Comcast and the YES Network is just the latest war of words over carriage fees. In Los Angeles, Dodgers network SportsNet LA is only carried by Time Warner Cable, a joint partner in the TV channel. Negotiations with other providers in the area, including DirecTV (DTV) and Verizon (VZ), have been in a stalemate since SportsNet LA launched in early 2014.",[]

In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals said North Carolina can issue license plates bearing the statement ""Choose Life."" The General Assembly in 2011 passed legislation allowing the anti-abortion expression while rejecting requests to also issue tags saying ""Respect Choice"" or similar abortion-rights phrases.

The same appeals court two years ago had said the General Assembly's actions discriminated against differing viewpoints and was unconstitutional. That was before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a Texas case last year that specialty license plates represented government speech, allowing Texas to reject a proposal for tags featuring a Confederate battle flag.

The Supreme Court ordered the Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court to reconsider the North Carolina case in light of its decision on the Texas tags.

""We now conclude that specialty license plates issued under North Carolina's program amount to government speech and that North Carolina is therefore free to reject license plate designs that convey messages with which it disagrees,"" Chief Judge William Traxler wrote in the appeals court's majority decision.

North Carolina native and appeals court Judge James Wynn dissented, saying the other two judges were misreading the implications of the Supreme Court's Texas case. He said expressions on license plates aren't purely the government's expression of messages it approves. Legislators themselves recognized that the tags were intended to be a forum for private expression by the people who buy them.

""A person who sees a North Carolina ""I'd Rather Be Shaggin""' specialty plate during Monday morning rush hour surely does not routinely and reasonably believe that such a plate embodies the State of North Carolina's credo,"" Wynn wrote. ""Nor is it likely that a North Carolina Libertarian who applies for a ""Don't Tread On Me"" specialty plate is motivated by a desire to convey to the public the government's seal of approval.""

The Supreme Court's decision must have recognized that allowing officials alone to determine government speech would allow it ""to discriminate against disfavored speakers and messages at will,"" Wynn wrote. It's implausible that ""the Supreme Court meant to force us to choose that the mule in this case is either a horse or a donkey.""

The legal fight has blocked the state Division of Motor Vehicles from producing the ""Choose Life"" tags.

The American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina, which sued to block the ""Choose Life"" plates, issued a statement urging the General Assembly to allow pro-abortion rights supporters to also express themselves.",[]

Trump was referring to a conference held by the conservative American Enterprise Institute at Sea Island off the coast of Georgia over the weekend, where one of the topics reportedly was stopping Trump from securing the Republican nomination.

The conference reportedly was attended by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan and other key Republican congressmen.

""I know all these people,"" Trump told Fox News Sean Hannity. ""These are people that are taking advantage of our country. They dont want to have strong borders. They want stuff flowing across the borders. They dont want to have taxation when countries treat us unfairly because they benefit from that.""

Cruzs comments about Trumps supporters comes ahead of another Republican debate Thursday night in Florida, the site of one of five big primaries next Tuesday. The stakes are higher than ever, as those five primaries could decide the fate of Trumps remaining rivals.

As Trump builds his delegate lead over the field following a string of wins earlier this week, Cruz is positioning himself as the one candidate who could actually beat Trump in the end  citing several primary and caucus victories, most recently in Idaho.

He was buoyed Wednesday by the endorsement of former candidate Carly Fiorina. And, speaking with Fox News Megyn Kelly, he said the other two candidates in the race  Marco Rubio and John Kasich  do not have a path to the nomination.

""Head-to-head, not only do I beat Donald Trump,"" Cruz said, ""but I defeat him resoundingly.""

Rubio is under tremendous pressure to win Florida next week, his home state. But a Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Rubio trailing Trump by 23 percentage points among likely Republican voters in Florida.

Rubio, though, told Kelly he has no intention of dropping out right now.

""I have never discussed dropping out with anyone on my team, or anyone on the planet Earth ... I'm the only one who can beat Donald Trump in Florida, he said.

Rubio also dismissed the possibility that he would form a so-called ""unity"" Republican ticket with Cruz, Trump's closest challenger in the delegate race, calling it "" the kind of drama that makes it interesting in TV to speculate about.""

""At some point we're all going to team up,"" Rubio said in reference to the non-Trump candidates. ""We're all going to be on the same team, I hope.

Former GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush also planned to meet with Trump's rivals on Thursday ahead of the GOP debate in Florida, fueling speculation that he's preparing to endorse a candidate challenging Trump.

Ohio Gov. Kasich, meanwhile, is vowing to win his home state next week. He told Fox News' Greta Van Susteren that he would ""probably not"" pick up enough delegates in other contests to overtake Trump, but noted that voters had only ""picked about half the delegates [so far] this year ... anything is possible.""

A Fox News poll released Wednesday showed Kasich leading Trump by five percentage points among likely Republican voters in the Buckeye State.",[]
