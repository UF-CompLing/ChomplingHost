i toggle caption Karen Kasmauski/Corbis Karen Kasmauski/Corbis

The world is focused on finding a link between pregnant women infected with the Zika virus and severe birth defects. But two studies and an editorial in this week's New England Journal of Medicine are reminders that malaria, a disease that killed about half a million people in 2015, also has profound consequences for pregnant women and their infants. The new studies provide much-needed guidance on how to prevent and treat malaria during pregnancy.

""Malaria during pregnancy is a major public health concern,"" says Dr. Joel Tarning, Head of Clinical Pharmacology at Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand, and author of the NEJM editorial ""Treatment of Malaria in Pregnancy.""

Recommended treatment for malaria is artemisinin combination therapy, or ACT, a mix of drugs shown to effectively treat the disease. But until now, the treatment has not been tested on women expecting babies.

""Pregnant women are often excluded from clinical trials, which hampers the implementation of these drug treatments,"" says Tarning.

If malaria is left untreated during pregnancy, infected red blood cells gather in the placenta and block the crucial exchange of nutrients from mother to fetus. The result can be miscarriage, stillbirth and low birth weight, says Tarning.

In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria during pregnancy is thought to be responsible for 20 percent of low birth weight babies each year, leading to 100,000 infant deaths, according to a recent NEJM study.

In Africa many people are immune from malaria and show no symptoms when infected, but pregnancy reduces a woman's immunity. Even when an infected woman has no symptoms, the disease can still harm the fetus, again resulting in low birth weight, miscarriage or stillbirth.

Despite a lack of clinical trial evidence on how to safely and effectively prevent and treat malaria during pregnancy, the consequences of no treatment are severe.

""Not treating pregnant women with malaria is not an option, since this is a life-threatening disease,"" says Tarning.

So the current WHO recommendations are that women living in areas where malaria is prevalent sleep under pesticide-treated nets; that women be given two doses of malaria prevention drugs during their pregnancy; and that women with malaria be treated during the second and third trimester.

Those WHO guidelines on treating malaria in pregnant women haven't changed, but now, with good evidence that they are safe and effective, health ministries can be more confident in carrying them out.

""I hope that these studies provide the needed evidence for countries to use ACTs in the treatment of pregnant women with malaria,"" says Tarning.

And they provide support for being treated earlier in pregnancy. Tarning pointed out a new study in The Lancet Infectious Diseases that treatment with ACTs is safe and effective during the first trimester. ""It's time to reconsider first-trimester anti-malarial treatment recommendations,"" he says.

Just as important, he says, the studies show that in countries where many pregnant women are infected with malaria but show no symptoms because of built-up immunity, treatment with ACTs will benefit them and their unborn babies. ""Hopefully, this will start the debate on using ACTs as preventive treatment in this group,"" he says.

Now there is clear guidance on how malaria drugs affect pregnant women. In another study, 3,428 pregnant women with malaria from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Malawi and Zambia were treated with four different anti-malaria drug combinations. Cure rates ranged from 95 percent to 99.2 percent, with few side effects. And the study on preventive treatment in 300 pregnant women with no malaria symptoms found that the drug combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, one of the combination drugs, prevented the disease and raised no safety concerns.

These studies on malaria's effect on pregnant women, a group previously not studied adequately in clinical trials, should go a long way in protecting mothers and babies from the harmful consequences of the disease.",[]

i toggle caption Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty Images Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty Images

An investigation into a clinical test in France that left one person dead and put five in the hospital has found evidence of brain damage in people who took high doses of the experimental pain medicine.

The early-stage clinical study, conducted by Biotrial in France, was halted in January when the side effects surfaced. It was the first time the drug, made by the Portuguese company Bial and known as ""BIA 10-2474,"" was tested in humans.

A report released Monday by a committee of scientists says people who got high cumulative doses of the drug sustained damage to their brains, specifically the hippocampus and pons. Those who got lower doses had no consistent adverse reactions.

The reports says the patients' symptoms and injuries were ""completely unusual, with no relatedness to a known disease or toxicity.""

Previous tests in rats, mice, dogs and monkeys involved doses up to 650 times those given to human subjects. While some animals had brain damage or died when given extremely high doses, there were no consistent signs indicating the drug would be unsafe for humans.

The molecule is meant to inhibit an enzyme called fatty acid amide hydrolase with a central role in the endocannabinoid system, a set of receptors also involved in processing THC, an ingredient in marijuana.

In all, 90 people took the experimental drug, at different doses. The six who were hospitalized had gotten the highest dose, which was 10 to 40 times higher than that needed to completely block the enzyme.

""We don't know by what mechanism the molecule caused these lesions, and I fear we won't know it for a long time since they couldn't have been due to the endocannabinoid system that was targeted by the molecule,"" Dr. Bernard Begaud, who leads the scientific committee investigating the incident, told the French publication Sciences et Avenir.

Two similar compounds were abandoned by other companies because they weren't deemed effective.

Often, the intensity of a drug's side effects increase with the dose. But in this case, the investigators note, there was no sign of a linear pattern. People who received a cumulative dose less than 200 milligrams were, for the most part, fine. But all six patients who received a cumulative dose higher than 250 milligrams had ""serious central nervous system symptoms.""

At those doses, the report authors hypothesize, the molecule may have suppressed the target enzyme too much, preventing it from breaking down other chemicals. That may have allowed a chemical like anandamide, which is present in chocolate in tiny amounts, to build up to dangerous concentrations in the brain.

Another idea is that the molecule acted on unintended enzymes or that it produced toxic byproducts in the brain.

The group, set up by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, will reconvene later this month to review hypotheses on what went wrong and to make recommendations to the French government to improve clinical trial regulations.

The committee has also asked Bial to explain why the company did preliminary studies in four species of animals, as opposed to the usual two, why it decided to continue studies on the potential pain reliever when it only worked in two animal tests, and why it chose to test such high cumulative doses in people.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is also investigating the case. The agency said in late January that while this drug hasn't been tested in the U.S., there are studies on other drugs that work the same way.",[]

i toggle caption The Kobal Collection The Kobal Collection

Where would you go, if you had a time machine? Ancient Egypt? Tang Dynasty China? The Globe Theater, in 1599? Or maybe to the 25th century, because who knows, Buck Rogers might actually be there.

Sadly, no one's likely to invent a working time machine any time soon. But that hasn't stopped the legions of writers who've been exploring time travel ever since H. G. Wells described his first Morlock. Slips and drops and nets and projections and paradoxes  writers have thought up a hundred ways to travel backwards and forwards in time. And that's one of the great things about literary time travel: the way every writer seems to invent the mechanism all over again, every time they put pen to paper.

You can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

""We can actually do whatever we want,"" says science fiction author Connie Willis. She's won all kinds of awards for her tales of time-traveling historians  like Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog. Willis says the best thing about time travel is no one's invented it yet  so it can be whatever you want.



""You know, you can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

Well, within reason  don't go stepping on any ancient butterflies, or accidentally shooting your own grandfather. You don't want to cause a paradox. ""The trickiest part of writing time travel is the paradoxes,"" Willis says, ""because the truth is, you know, we can't go back in time, one of the reasons is, just by being there we would change things, you know, so that's what you spend most of your time doing!""

Avoiding paradoxes is especially tricky for Willis, who's generally keeping track of multiple characters jumping around to different points in time. ""And I have to remember, that happened earlier, but later, and hasn't happened yet  and I usually end up writing angry notes to myself at the head of every page: she still thinks he's a murderer!""

Unlike Willis's historians, I can't go back in time  but I can do the next best thing, which is to visit Readercon, a speculative fiction convention that happens every year in Boston. If anyone knows about time travel literature, it's these folks. In fact, this year they held an entire panel devoted to time travel. Panel moderator  and occasional NPR contributor  K. Tempest Bradford is working on a time travel novel herself, ""basically doing Shakespeare's Twelfth Night with time travel instead of shipwrecks,"" she says.

Part of the appeal of time travel, Bradford adds, is the lure of experiencing other times and places. But it's also a chance for a cosmic do-over. ""I know that if I were to travel back in time, I might warn some people that they shouldn't do this or that thing, or they should maybe be careful who they trade blankets with.""

Writer, bookseller and Readercon attendee Leah Bobet says the past is fascinating because it's the one place we can't go, ""and there are so many ways time travel stories both question and reinforce the past-is-past paradigm. And so it's grappling with regret, it's learning to emotionally deal with the consequences of the one thing we can't really undo.""

It tends to be the past that people talk about, when they talk about time travel. ""And that's interesting,"" says Bobet, ""because the future is always coming. The future's coming whether you like it or not, second by second by second  the past is never coming again.""

Unless, of course, you have a time machine  and that brings us to the quintessential time traveler's dilemma: Assuming you could get to Berlin in 1937, should you kill Hitler? ""Oh yeah,"" says Connie Willis. ""That's the dilemma of time travel, is that no event is unconnected to every other event. And so you could bring about something much worse. Except that Hitler was so bad and so unique, I have a tendency to think that given the chance, yeah. You betcha.""

Personally, I might go back to Sarajevo in 1914 and slip Gavrilo Princip a knockout drop instead. If I had a time machine.",[]

Nice work by all those involved in todays news from the Navy Yard. We did not fall into the traps that some other media outlets did. We stuck with what was known, we were clear about what was not known, and we stayed away from rumors.

A couple things to keep in mind:

 When passing along information to the lead editor(s) and Newsdesk-Eds@npr.org, please be as specific as you can about the source. For example, if the news is that the all clear has been given, tell us whos saying that. A police lieutenant you just spoke to? The public information officer on the scene? The mayors chief of staff? Knowing that will help Newscast, The Two-Way and editors as they sort through what are often conflicting reports.

 When passing along information, be clear about what you feel can be reported and what cannot be reported (but is something you want editors to be aware of). That will also help Newscast, The Two-Way and editors as they sort through what are often conflicting reports.

Again, those are points to keep in mind. But the most important thing to take away from today is how well we did when it came to reporting solid information and staying away from thinly sourced rumors. Thanks.

SAGAL: Well, it's nice to have you us, Brad. You're going to play the game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction. Bill, what is Brad's topic?

KURTIS: I prefer hardcover books. They're better to slap you with.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Literature is full of fierce disagreements. Think of last year's debate over Harper Lee's second book or two hobos fighting with knives at a library. This week...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: This week, we read about a new literary controversy. Our panelists are going to tell you about it. Pick the real one, you'll win our prize - Carl Kasell's voice on your voicemail. Are you ready to play?

BAKER: I am, indeed.

SAGAL: All right, well, first let's hear from Bobcat Goldthwait.

BOBCAT GOLDTHWAIT: Park Ranger and respected Sasquatch expert ranger Robert Lederman writes coming-of-age stories for tweens similar to ""Twilight"" series, except set in the world of Bigfoot. His first book ""Yeti Or Not"" was a...

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: ...Was a hit with the Bigfoot teen-lit crowd and other Bigfoot enthusiasts. But controversy arose when his follow-up ""Yeti Or Not: The Awakening...""

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: ...Added a group of wood nymphs and fairies to the saga. Serious Bigfoot researchers are irate. They say that by adding wood nymphs and fairies, Lederman is making the Bigfoot community big look ridiculous.

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: ""Fairies aren't real,"" exclaimed Timothy Pearson, a leading squatcher.

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: Even if they were wooden nymphs and fairies, Sasquatches would never associate with them. Bigfoot is a very private hominid. We're not asking Lederman to censor himself. We're just asking that his book comes with a warning label explaining that some of it is fiction.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Controversy in the Sasquatch lit community.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Sasquatch yes, wood nymphs, no. Your next story of fiction friction comes from Roxanne Roberts.

ROXANNE ROBERTS: The cat mystery world is hissing about a controversy in its industry - talking cats. What's that you say? Cat mysteries? Indeed, it's a popular genre of detective stories with little sex, violence or swearing...

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: ...With lots and lots of adorable kitties who speak English to humans - or should they? Shirley Rousseau Murphy's ""Joe Grey"" series features two talking cats who help the town police chief solve cases. Other authors create crime-solving cats who only meow. Quote, ""people tend to feel very strongly about it,"" author Clea Simon told The Wall Street Journal. ""Cats that speak - they're an abomination."" The Cat Writers' Association - yes, that's a thing, to...

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: ...Is firmly in the talking cat corner, awarding its top honors to books with chatty cats in the tradition of Puss in Boots and The Cat in the Hat. Quote, ""so many fans tell me they wish their cats could speak,"" said Murphy, who sold 1.3 million books. ""Sometimes I say, are you sure you want to know? Personally, I know exactly what my cats would say - forget that dead body and feed us. And then we'll lie on top of that newspaper you're trying to read.""

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Do cats talk? Yes, no, yes, no - a controversy of the cat lit community.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Finally, your last story of a beef in books comes from Adam Burke.

ADAM BURKE: A literary squabble has broken out at this year's annual celebration Putinalia in which artists and writers descend on the outskirts of St. Petersburg to see who can create the best homage to the city's favorite son, Russian leader Vladimir Putin. In the contentious poetry competition, runner-up Anatoly Neskerov has accused winner Edna Kedrov secretly satirizing the nation's doughty leader with her poem ""Our Father Is Brave And Beautiful,"" which contains the lines a herd of bears with gums in their teeth led by strapping Putin, his arms full of salmon. It is...

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: ...According to Neskerov, (imitating Russian accent) so over-the-top as to be a mockery. Kedrov has in turn accused Neskerov's work of being as over-the-top. ""Please, said Kedrov, the poem is about Putin pinning all of the world's heads of state in a judo match."" Festival organizers say this year's winner will stand but will impose strict rules on banning satire in the future.

SAGAL: All right, so these are your choices.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: From Bobcat Goldthwait, controversy in the world of Sasquatch literature when one of the favorite authors puts in wood fairies and wood fairies don't exist, from Roxanne Roberts, a controversy in the world of cat literature about whether the cats should talk or not or from Adam Burke, controversy over at the annual Putin literary competition, where two poets accuse each other of secretly satirizing their dear leader. Which of these is the real story of the a literary controversy?

BAKER: Well, number one - I think that's what I'm going for.

SAGAL: So you're going to go with Bobcat's story of Sasquatch lit being roiled by the introduction wood fairies, was it?

BAKER: Yeah.

SAGAL: Well, to bring you the correct answer, we spoke to someone intimately - and I mean intimately involved with the real story.

CLEA SIMON: There is a split between those who believe that cats should act simply like animals and those of us who believe that cats can talk.

SAGAL: That was Clea Simon. She is the author of four cat-related mystery series - not books, series - and she is a member in good standing of the Cat Writers' Association. So as you heard, Brad, Roxanne Roberts had the real story. You didn't win. You earned a point for Bobcat, which I'm sure he appreciates but which no doubt infuriates Roxanne. She'll have her vengeance later. Thank you so much for playing. Bye-bye.

Its been drilled into our heads that we should include at least a bit of a persons biography on first reference. So this guidance is a break from tradition. Here goes:

If someone is well-known, it will often feel and sound more natural to move that bio material to later in a Newscast spot, blog post or show piece. In some cases it may not even be necessary to include all the biographical information youre tempted to fold in.

For instance, rather than beginning with a reference to 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin or former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin or former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, simply slip one of those reminders in later.

In most cases, theres no need to remind the audience on first reference that Hillary Clinton is a former secretary of state, former senator or former first lady. You may need to say Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton, but there are more conversational ways to get that information across as well. For instance, by talking about Hillary Clintons campaign for the White House and getting the word Democratic in at another point.

Its unlikely you would start a conversation with a friend by saying Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. You would say Bernie Sanders. In many cases, we can do the same and let the references to his run for the Democratic nomination, the senate and Vermont come in naturally.

This guidance is mostly about politicians, but can apply to others as well. Former Beatle doesnt always have to go in front of Paul McCartney. Oprah Winfrey can stand on her own for a line or two. Boxer Muhammad Ali may not be necessary on first reference.

Heres the takeaway: We dont have to be bound to the notion that first references must be mini resumes. Use your judgment.

Related notes:

 This does not change the way we refer to sitting presidents, vice presidents and other world leaders. Were sticking with formalities on first references to them.

 Party IDs are key information in stories about policy makers and politicians. If you dont include an R, a D, a Democrat or a Republican, you will hear from readers and listeners who say youre trying to hide someones affiliation.

 If the news is about legislation thats being introduced, a hearing thats being held, results of an investigation that are being released or other official business, we stick with tradition. It would be Sen. Jane Doe or Attorney Gen. John Doe on first reference.

 It should always be Conqueror of the Unpronounceable Word Korva Coleman on first reference.

i toggle caption Geoff Robins/AFP/Getty Images Geoff Robins/AFP/Getty Images

Tonight the two Democratic candidates  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders  meet in Miami for a debate.

Before Tuesday night, the debate was looking like an unimportant afterthought to a race that could have been all wrapped up. But not anymore, after Sanders' stunningly unexpected win in Michigan last night.

Here are three things to watch:

1. Delegates or momentum?

Hillary Clinton's campaign says all that matters is delegates and by that measure she succeeded Tuesday night  increasing her delegate lead over Bernie Sanders. But her loss to Sanders exposed troubling weaknesses for Clinton which she needs to address tonight.

How will she try to woo independents (which she lost) and white working class voters (which she almost lost)?

2. Sanders' new lease on life

Just when pundits were getting ready to call him irrelevant, Sanders is now set up nicely for Ohio  another big Rust Belt state that votes next Tuesday.

Tonight in Miami, will he raise the electability question: If Clinton lost Michigan to a Democratic populist in March, why wouldn't she lose Michigan to a Republican populist (Donald Trump) in November?

3. The enthusiasm gap

Republicans keep on posting high turnout levels. Democratic turnout is below 2008 levels.

In addition, the news media are inclined to cover a rambling 45-minute infomercial by Trump  billed as a presidential style news conference  instead of speeches by the other candidates.

If Trump is the nominee and continues to drive ratings, the Democrats might be gasping for airtime this fall.",[]

Meanwhile heres a reminder, from the Ethics Handbook:

Be sure to consider legal issues when dealing with minors (generally defined as anyone under the age of 18). An interview of a minor about a sensitive subject requires us to secure permission from at least one of the minors parents (preferably both) or a legal guardian. Examples of sensitive subjects include cheating, sexual activity, involvement in gangs or crime, difficult family relationships, probation violation, out-of-wedlock pregnancy or parenthood, victims sexual abuse and similar topics that could have legal ramifications or lead to embarrassment. An interview of a minor in a special custodial situation, such as foster care, juvenile detention, or holding facilities for illegal immigrants, requires the consent of the person who has custody of the minor. Utah also requires the consent of both the custodian of the juvenile facility and the minors parent. An interview on a non-sensitive topic (normal childhood activities, sports, book, movies, trips to the zoo, baseball and the like) does not require consent. Generally however, any interview on school premises will require the permission of the school authorities. In cases where there is even a hint of doubt about whether to get consent, contact our legal team (look for LegalAlert in the NPR internal email address book).

It's by the Singaporean writer and illustrator Sonny Liew, who was born in Malaysia, studied philosophy at Cambridge University and is best known in the U.S. for his DC Comics series Doctor Fate about an Egyptian-American superhero. His new graphic novel, his biggest and most ambitious work, spans decades. Here's John's review of ""The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye.""

JOHN POWERS, BYLINE: It wasn't so long ago that comics were considered artistically marginal, adolescent fantasy. All that changed with the 1986 release of ""Maus."" Art Spiegelman's graphic novel - as they're now called - tackled the Holocaust and its effect on his family. ""Maus"" won a Pulitzer Prize and unleashed the ongoing wave of masterful books that includes Alan Moore's ""Watchmen,"" Chris Ware's ""Jimmy Corrigan"" and Allison Bechdel's ""Fun Home."" Grappling with everything from sex and politics to violence and alienation, these comics took you places that you haven't gone before.

That happens again in ""The Art of ""Charlie Chan Hock Chye,"" a startlingly brilliant tour de force by the Singapore artist and writer Sonny Liew. Although the premise sounds simple - it's the biography of a fictional comic book artist - what Liew does with it is anything but. At once dizzyingly meta and deeply heartfelt, the book spans 80 years and in its complicated layering remind me of everything from ""Maus"" and ""The Tin Drum"" to, believe it or not, ""Ulysses.""

The book's hero is Chan Hock Chye. His English-language name in a little joke is Charlie. Chan is born in 1938 Singapore. And from the beginning, this shopkeeper's son loves to draw. When he first discovers comic books at the local library, he's forever smitten. He dedicates his whole life to making them, becoming a monk of the craft. Never married, he turns down commercial jobs to spend decades creating comics that don't make money. But while Chan personally leads a quiet, almost invisible existence, his career is shot through with the great drama of history.

He lives through the epic transformation of his tiny island home from a Third World outpost of the British Empire to a sleek country often called the Switzerland of Asia, clean, orderly and so prosperous that its per capita GDP is one and a half times our own. Over the years, Chan experiences the Japanese invasion of World War II, Singapore's messy struggle for independence and the eventual emergence of a seemingly all-powerful ruling party. He watches this skillfully run if sometimes repressive state become a safe haven where billionaires move to stash their cash.

Now, Liew doesn't present this transformation so baldly. We watch it happen by reading the comics that Chan supposedly creates about these events. Of course, Liew himself creates them all, both naive and sophisticated, with dazzling virtuosity. Man, can this guy draw. Giving us a grand tour of comic book history, he works in styles that reference everything from Britain's ""The Beano"" and Japanese manga to Mad Magazine, ""Pogo,"" ""Spiderman,"" even Scrooge McDuck. Every page hums with visual invention, including those pages in which Liew himself turns up, a bespectacled little dude, to comment on the action.

Although ""The Art Charlie Chan Hock Chye"" is probably the greatest work of art ever produced in Singapore, the book was controversial there. It's not a country big on dissent, and Liew points out the cracks in the official myths erected by the party that's ruled for the last half-century. Yet at the same time, he hasn't written a subversive tract or poisoned pen letter.

Even as he regrets the country's missed opportunities, the book is filled with affection, even love. It's a Valentine to cartooning, to old buildings and street food, to heroes written out of official history, to ordinary people trying to make a better life. Most moving and most universal is Liew's portrait of the artist as a young, middle-aged and old man. By today's standards, Chan would be considered a failure. His work doesn't sell. His apartment is modest. And as the country around him grows richer and glossier, he lives in obscurity, all alone, creating comics about a success-mad culture that ignores him.

Near the end, the aging Chan jets to San Diego to attend Comic-Con in hopes of finding kindred spirits and maybe landing some work. The trip doesn't pan out, yet he doesn't let this disappointment stop him. Back home, surrounded by his pens and ink bottle, he keeps doing what he's always done - pursuing his art in the face of a world that doesn't seem to want it. You see, Chan would rather remain marginal forever than give up doing what he cares about most. And Liew makes it heartbreakingly clear that such devotion is one of the highest forms of grace.

GROSS: John Powers is film and TV critic for Vogue and vogue.com. He reviewed ""The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye"" by Sonny Liew.

It took Abdul Arian months to realize that his decision to migrate from his home country, Afghanistan, to Germany was a huge mistake.

He set off nearly a year ago, hoping to be granted asylum so that he could go to university and study psychology.

His journey, organized by smugglers, was long and perilous. Arian, 24, says he nearly drowned off the shores of Greece, when the inflatable dinghy he was traveling in capsized.

He says he and his fellow travelers got lost somewhere in Hungary and walked through the rain for 24 hours before they found the path again.

Yet the reason that Arian finally saw his mistake was not because something nasty or dangerous happened to him. It was because nothing really happened at all.

When Arian arrived in Germany, he was placed in a migrants' reception center.

""We had nothing to do in the camp,"" he says. ""We just stayed there.""

He played a lot of soccer. He ate a lot of jelly sandwiches. He moped about. Officials wrote down his name. In the end, he says, he was in Germany for 10 months, yet ""no one asked me why I went there and why I was there."" No one seemed to want to listen to him explain why he should be allowed to stay.

It also soon became clear to Arian that local Germans did not appreciate his presence. While people from the church and social workers helped the migrants and were ""very nice,"" residents of the nearby village seemed hostile.

""When we were walking along the sidewalk, people would avoid us,"" says Arian.

Germany Says Many Must Leave

Last year, 150,000 Afghans arrived in Germany. The German authorities estimate less that half qualify for asylum.

German officials say at present a tiny number of Afghans  1,600, according to estimates given to them by Afghan officials in Germany  are willing to go back home voluntarily.

But many will have to leave, says Germany's ambassador to Afghanistan, Markus Potzel.

""It means that more than half of them have to be sent back because they can't stay,"" says Potzel. ""There are some obstacles for them to be sent back immediately, but we have a huge number of Afghans who are not eligible to stay in Germany and should be sent back.""

During Arian's time in Germany, he began to notice that Syrian migrants were being treated very differently. They were provided with language lessons and eventually passports, he says.

""When we complained to the social workers, they responded frankly. They said, 'We've invited Syrians here, not Afghans,' "" he says.

This prompted some of Arian's fellow Afghans to stage demonstrations.

""They were shouting, 'We don't want to go back to Afghanistan! There is a war there!' "" he says. ""But no one listened to them.""

The weeks rolled by. Arian was moved to another center. But still nothing happened. He grew steadily more convinced that he had no chance of being allowed to stay in Germany. Then depression set in.

""I was in very bad condition. I couldn't sleep. I decided to go back to Afghanistan, before I went crazy,"" he says.

Arian returned home last month. He was one of 125 Afghans sent back to Afghanistan on a charter flight organized by the German and Afghan governments. The passengers all signed a form saying they were returning voluntarily.

Arian's family spent most of their savings on his trip to Germany. To pay the smuggler's bill of $7,500, they sold land and a car. Arian is now worrying about what his family feels about that.

""So far, I haven't seen any reaction from them because I've just arrived back. But I don't know what's in their hearts,"" he says.

Arian is faced with finding work amid rampant unemployment in a society where good jobs are very hard to find without political or personal connections  or cash for a hefty bribe.

Humiliation For Some

That much is clear from the experience of Shirdil Bayat, 40. He was deported from Denmark two years ago, after a court rejected his request for asylum  which he'd based on a claim that his life was threatened by the Taliban in his home city, Kandahar.

Lacking personal connections, Bayat took 16 months to find permanent work as an office cleaner in the capital, Kabul. He says returning home to Kandahar is still too risky. On a recent day when he was interviewed by NPR, he'd been laid off because of budget cuts. He says he has no idea what he'll do next.

Bayat says returning to Afghanistan after having failed in Europe can be very humiliating. Some families are sympathetic, but far from all.

""People jeer at you. They ask, 'Why did so-and-so get citizenship in Europe while you did not? Maybe you're useless,' "" he says.

The Germans are running a PR campaign in Afghanistan, trying to deter Afghans from traveling to their land. They've posted announcements on billboards, buses and the Internet, urging Afghans to think twice before setting off.

Germany views many of the Afghans who've arrived on its soil as economic migrants seeking jobs or education.

German officials maintain that under international law, Germany is not required to grant asylum to those migrants  unlike Syrians, who are fleeing a war zone.

The United Nations estimates that last year, some 11,000 civilians were killed or injured by conflict in Afghanistan. Afghans say that bolsters proof that there is war in Afghanistan, too  and that Afghans should therefore be granted protection by European nations.

""Afghans are not leaving Afghanistan because of a lack of jobs, "" says Ashraf Haidari, director-general of policy and strategy at Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry. ""They are fleeing generalized violence. Terrorism that is killing men, women and children,"" he says. ""That - and political uncertainty as a result of withdrawal of international forces and diminishing international development aid.""

Germany Draws A Distinction

However, Potzel, Germany's ambassador, says the situation in Afghanistan differs hugely from Syria's.

""Here in Afghanistan, you don't have a government who would bomb their own population,"" he says. ""Here, the government tries to protect their own people. There are unsafe regions and there are less unsafe regions in Afghanistan, and there are regions  especially in the big cities  where a sort of normal life is going on.""

Germany is one of the main international donors to Afghanistan. Over the last 14 years, it has poured a great deal of money into the country. It seems unlikely that it would wish to risk making Afghanistan still more unstable by forcibly returning large numbers of Afghans over a short time span.

Yet there is considerable concern in Afghanistan about what might happen if significant numbers of angry and disillusioned young Afghans are eventually sent back from Europe.

Some European countries provide financial support packages to help people settle in, but the sums are generally small and over a limited time period.

Professor Sayed Masoud, an economist based in Kabul, foresees ""disaster.""

""Either they will join the Taliban or become drug addicts,"" he says, ""because the government can't provide jobs.""

Meanwhile, Afghans keep heading on the trail to Europe. On a recent early morning in Kabul, hundreds of men were lined up outside the government office that issues passports.

Among them was Wahidullah Mohammadi, 19, who wants to migrate to Europe to go to school. He is aware of the risk of being deported back home  and of losing the thousands of dollars he'll pay to smugglers.

Still, he still thinks the odds are worth it.

""The situation is not good here and there is no guaranteed future,"" he says. ""This is why I have to accept this risk.""",[]

In the past, falling oil prices have given a boost to the world economy, but recent forecasts for global growth have been ratcheted down, even as oil prices sink lower and lower. Does that mean the link between lower oil prices and growth has weakened?

Jason Bordoff, head the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, says there are still good reasons to believe cheap oil should heat up the world economy.

""Consumers have more money in their pockets when they're paying less at the pump,"" says Bordoff. ""They spend that money on other things, which stimulates the economy.""

Sara Johnson, director of global economic research at IHS, says the biggest gains goes to countries that import most or all of their oil  China, Japan, India, South Korea, Germany and France. The United states also remains a net importer of oil, despite huge increases in U.S. production from the shale oil boom.

As the list suggests, the countries most likely to benefit have big economies and lots of consumers.

But doesn't the extra money in the pockets of those countries' consumers mean an equal loss in oil-producing countries, making the total economic effect a wash? Not necessarily, says Johnson.

Many oil producers built up huge reserve funds when prices were high, she says  so ""when prices fall they will draw [on] their reserves to support government spending and subsidies for their consumers.""

Bordoff says Saudi Arabia, with reserves of around $600 billion, is a good example. A vast number of Saudi paychecks come from government employment. Using that money means that, when oil prices drop, ""the economy doesn't feel it as directly, day to day, in terms of people's paychecks,"" he says. Even when oil prices fall, Saudi consumers can keep spending.

Venezuela's Free-Fall

But not all oil producers have big reserves. In Venezuela, for instance, collapsing oil prices have sent its economy into free-fall.

""It's been ravaged with shortages of basic foodstuffs,"" Bordoff says. ""You can't find everyday necessities, like toilet paper, on supermarket shelves.""

Venezuela's inflation rate has skyrocketed to 800 percent, and the country's economic collapse is subtracting from global growth. To a lesser extent, growth in Nigeria, Russia and even in the United States is being hurt by the damage to their oil sectors.

Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, believes that the negative effects of plunging oil prices are swamping the positive effects of cheaper oil. He says the tip-off is a sharp decline in global trade, which has slumped partly because oil-producing nations can't afford to import as much as they used to.

""The value of world trade has gone down by 14 percent, year over year,"" says Weinberg, quoting figures from the International Monetary Fund. That's the biggest drop in the post-World War II period, except for the decline during the financial crisis of 2008, he says: ""In fact we're talking about reducing world GDP growth from about 3 percent to about 1.5 percent, using the measures that the IMF uses  and that's a pretty catastrophic year.""

Pressure On World Growth

IMF forecasters continue to expect global growth in the 3 percent range, but Weinberg doesn't think those numbers will hold up.

Both Jason Bordoff and Sara Johnson acknowledge the global economic benefit from a fall in oil prices today is likely lower than it was in the past. One reason is that more countries are big oil producers now, so the nations suffering from the price drop account for a larger share of the global economy.

Also, Bordoff says consumers, in the United States at least, are acting cautiously with the windfall they're getting at the gas pump.

""We're seeing, coming out of the Great Recession, that consumers are saving a larger percentage,"" says Bordoff, ""rather than going out and spending it.""

And a number of oil producing countries, including Saudi Arabia, are trimming their gasoline subsidies and raising taxes, Bordoff says, so the net savings for global consumers is not as big as the oil price plunge might suggest.",[]

No matter where you are in Tucson, Ariz., you're no more than 20 miles from Saguaro National Park. The park and its tall, pronged, namesake cactus literally surround Tucson. There's the rounded top of the park's cactus-studded Wasson Peak to the west, the park's desert-to-forest Rincon Mountain Range to the east and about a million people living between.

But if you go around Tucson  to its historic barrio neighborhoods, swap meets or hiking trails  and ask people about their neighboring national park, you might be surprised.

""Saguaro High School?""

""I have no idea.""

""What's that?""

Darla Sidles, Saguaro National Park's superintendent, is not surprised by those responses. She knows better than most the disconnect that exists between a lot of locals here and the park next door. ""The type of people that are coming to the park versus the people just five minutes away in Tucson is really an issue for us here,"" she says.

The reason: The type of people that are coming to the park don't reflect the type of people living in the community. Tucson is about 44 percent Hispanic or Latino. Of the park's roughly 650,000 annual visitors, less than 2 percent self-identify as Hispanic. ""If we're not being relevant to almost half of the population, then 30, 40, 50 years from now, the park isn't going to matter to them,"" Sidles says.

A Call To Action

The disconnect between Tucson's minority populations and Saguaro National Park is striking given their proximity, but it's hardly unique.

The National Park Service overall has a diversity problem. There were a record 307.2 million visits to U.S. national parks in 2015, and it's fair to say that the majority of those visitors were white. The National Park Service doesn't track the demographics of its visitors, but the most recent survey commissioned by the Park Service to see how different populations groups related to the parks found that 9 percent of American visitors were Hispanic. African-Americans accounted for 7 percent. Asian-Americans were 3 percent. Collectively, minorities made up just over 20 percent of the visitors to national parks, despite the fact that they made up nearly 40 percent of the U.S. population.

toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR

""We know that visitation does not reflect the diversity of the nation,"" says Jon Jarvis, the director of the National Park Service. ""And that's a concern.""

It's a concern on multiple levels. For one, the national parks depend on public money, political support and community engagement for funding. The Census Bureau is projecting that non-whites will make up the majority of the U.S. population within the next 25 years. Urbanization is growing. And millennials are now the biggest generation in history. Add that all up and it's not hard to predict that multicultural, mostly-urban millennials ""will assume all seats of power and responsibilities for the nation,"" Jarvis says. ""So connecting to that generation is essential to the Park Service's ability to thrive in our second century.""

The other reason it's important to connect to all of America's shifting demographics, Jarvis says, is it's the Park Service's job. ""The Park Service has a responsibility that Congress and the president have granted us over our history,"" he says.

To that end, Jarvis has made increasing diversity at the national parks a top priority as the Park Service approaches its centennial. His Call to Action plan  a vision for the organization's future  states: ""In our second century, we will fully represent our nation's ethnically and culturally diverse communities.""

'This Is Not Your Space'



Figuring out why there's a disconnect between Tucson's minority groups and Saguaro National Park is about to be Cam Juarez's job. Juarez, from Tucson, is a leader in the Hispanic community serving on the city's school board. In a couple of weeks, he's going to start working for Saguaro National Park as their outreach coordinator.

toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR

Juarez getting a jump start on that by visiting a couple of schools in Tucson to ask parents, teachers, administrators and students if they know about Saguaro and, if not, why. He's also going to try to get them interested in the park and what it has to offer. ""It's like we're out there selling snake oil,"" he says on the way to a charter school in south Tucson, which is predominantly Hispanic. ""I'd wager to say that there's a whole lot of folks here that don't use the park, close as they are to it.""

In a way, Juarez is the perfect person for this job because he can relate. To date, he says, he's visited three national parks, including Saguaro. Growing up, his family never went to national parks. They never even talked about it. ""It just wasn't something we did,"" he says.

His family was poor. ""We didn't have camping gear or fishing gear,"" he says. ""We had hoes and shovels; work implements and school books.""

Even as he got older, Juarez says, he thought of national parks as a place for ""folks that were white or folks that had resources and sometimes you likened them to each other."" Either way, he didn't think the parks were for people like him.

He's not alone in that sentiment. That survey of park visitors released in 2011 found that non-whites were three times more likely to say that parks provide poor service and are not safe places to visit. And Juarez heard some of that at the schools he went to.

Oscar Medina, a teacher at Changemaker High School, talked about how he visited a park with his family ""and none of the information signs were in Spanish."" A mom at Carrillo Intermediate talked about how she wanted to go to Saguaro with her family, but there weren't facilities for a large group. Another pointed out there's no public transportation.

Some of the reasons were universal: the cost is prohibitive; not enough time because of work; the lack of shade in a desert park.

i toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR

Others were more subtle. Luis Perales, the chief academic officer at Changemaker High School, says that the reasons minorities, and particularly Latinos, aren't going to national parks is that ""spaces either are inviting or are rejecting in many ways. And I think a lot of what's been created [with national parks] is this idea that this is not your space.""

It's not that Latinos don't want to go outside. Go to any park or hiking trail in Tucson and you'll see that's not the case. It's that they might want to have a different experience in the outdoors. A lot of what the national parks promote is the solitude and quiet of a John Muir photo. ""Go out on your own, enjoy nature, don't harm it,"" Perales says. That messaging of ""rugged individualism"" doesn't necessarily work with Latinos, Perales says. ""It's like no, I'm going to bring my whole family, we're going to be loud, we're going to explore,"" he says. ""That's not what's promoted at this point. It has to be a compromise.""

'Reflect The Face Of The People We Want To Attract'

There's another reason that people gave for not feeling connected or welcome at the national parks, and it's one that many people danced around. Bella Furr, an intern and temporary worker at Saguaro National Park had no such qualms: ""The other thing is the Park Service is full of white men.""

That's not entirely accurate, but it's not far off the mark. According to the most recent survey, 80 percent of Park Service's roughly 22,000 employees are white. Anecdotally, people involved with the Park Service say, the demographics breakdown of the Park Service's estimated 220,000 volunteers is similar.

At Saguaro National Park, Sidles estimates about 75 percent of their workforce is white. ""We don't have as diverse a staff as we should have,"" she says. ""We have to reflect the face of the people we want to attract.""

That idea of reflecting the diversity of the public in its workforce is one the National Park Service has been pushing for a long time. Programs have been in put place nationally and initiatives have been launched, but little has changed. That's bred some cynicism about the service's efforts in some quarters. One former long-time National Park Service employee interviewed for this story not-so-jokingly said that the National Park Service could also be celebrating the centennial of its efforts to be more diverse.

There's a myriad of reasons park managers and officials give for the slow rate of change. There's the labyrinthian federal job application system as well as preferential hiring mandates that can keep the resumes of diverse, local candidates off of hiring manager's desks. More directly, there's low job turnover and few new opportunities for diverse candidates. With baby boomers nearing retirement though, that's expected to change and open opportunities for more diversity.

i toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR

Saguaro National Park wants to be ready for that opportunity and being ready means having young, diverse, experienced candidates for jobs as they come open. That's why they've partnered with the nonprofit group Friends of Saguaro National Park to hire a group of young locals like Yesenia Gamez on temporary contracts.

Gamez is what's called a Next Generation Ranger. She works at Saguaro National Park's visitor centers and in its interior, but she also works in Tucson, visiting local schools and working at information stands at local events.

On a recent weekend, she showed off a big bleached grizzly bear skull to a group of young kids at community health event at a park in downtown Tucson. They guessed what animal it was.

Gamez says she loves doing events like this because she gets to interact with people who otherwise don't get to experience the park. ""People that come to the park are usually retirees who can drive out there,"" she says. ""This is a low socioeconomic thing. It's in the heart of Tucson. It's kind of like we're bringing the park to them.""

By doing that, she says, the Next Gen Rangers can provide a friendly, familiar face and appeal to people where they're comfortable. They can also tell younger versions of themselves about the opportunities that exist in the National Park Service  if those opportunities exist.",[]

Slovenia, Serbia and Croatia have closed their borders to all ""irregular"" travelers, save those with immediate humanitarian needs. This effectively shuts down the Balkan route to Europe.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

Well, the door to Europe is closing. Three Balkan nations that have served as a pathway north from Greece announced that they will no longer be allowing anyone in without a visa. Those countries are Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia. This means migrants who are struggling to reach northern Europe along what's called the Balkan route are now blocked. Tens of thousands of people are now stuck in Greece, an EU member state. And let's talk to reporter Joanna Kakissis, who has been covering this story. She's in Athens this morning. Joanna, good morning.

JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Good morning, David.

GREENE: So why now? Why are these Balkan countries deciding to do this right now?

KAKISSIS: Well, you know, they really had no choice after Austria imposed these very severe border restrictions last month. Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia - these are all parts of what used to be Yugoslavia. And they have long said they don't have the resources to care for very large groups of asylum seekers. Migrants were just transiting through these countries, as you mentioned. So sometimes they only stayed a few hours before going on to the next border. But with northern Europe closing to migrants, Balkan countries worry that lots of Syrians and Iraqis would be stuck there, just as is happening now in Greece.

GREENE: Well, and I've been listening to some of your reporting along the Greek-Macedonian border. I mean, some of those borders have already been tightening. And it sounds like just a terrible scene with people just stuck trying to get through.

KAKISSIS: Yeah, that's right. There are a lot of desperate people at the border. There are currently more than 35,000 Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans stuck in Greece - in crowded camps mostly. And along that border, the Greek-Macedonian border, there are about 14,000 people camped out in tents. When I was there, the conditions were terrible. And they continue to be terrible. It's muddy. There are few toilets and showers. I saw lots of moms waiting in these super long lines for, like, three, four hours for food. I saw lots of sick little kids. I met Fadi Kamar Aldeen at this camp. He's a lawyer from Idlib, Syria. His wife, Randa. His wife, Randa, was a physics teacher back home. They have three young children and they want to go to Germany. And Fadi was hoping German officials would do something about the border closures.

FADI KAMAR ALDEEN: They must help us, you know? We have bigger problem. These people, these children, these women must stay in good place in peace.

KAKISSIS: In peace - so some people may ask, well, Greece is peaceful - isn't it? Yes, yes, it is peaceful. But it's not prepared to house huge numbers of destitute people.

GREENE: Well, and, Joanna, I guess we should remember, I mean, Fadi, this lawyer, talking about his desires to get to Germany - Germany has been more welcoming than other European countries. But the problem is the countries in between have really been shutting these borders down, just stopping people like him from getting there.

KAKISSIS: Yes, and that's because there's a sentiment going around Europe that too many migrants are coming in, too many people that Europeans are going to have to support. And there are several countries that don't want any migrants at all. They don't want to share the burden. So Germany may still be saying you're welcome, but there are several other countries that say you're not.

GREENE: And what about the finger-pointing at Greece? I mean, that it sounds like is becoming much more intense - countries basically saying to the Greeks, this is your problem, you've got to deal with it.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Yeah, I mean, Slovakia and Austria, for example, have been saying that Greece doesn't know how to patrol its sea borders, that it should seal its sea borders. They're getting - they're lecturing the Greeks on this. And the Greeks are outraged that two landlocked nations are telling them how to patrol their own coast. In Slovakia, the prime minister is echoing Donald Trump and saying no Muslim migrants will ever enter his country. He's even gone as far as saying that Greece should be kicked out of Europe's passport-free zone for failing to patrol its borders.

GREENE: What's next for people like Fadi who you spoke to who are sitting along that border?

KAKISSIS: Well, the EU is now pushing Greece to finish reception centers that could house tens of thousands of people with the idea that the migrants currently in Greece will be here a really long time. And that's very, very scary for people like Fadi and his family. They haven't showered for two weeks because there are no showers there. And they have been sending me messages this morning saying, OK, we're losing hope. We're going to stay here. They just don't know how to get from Greece to Germany.

GREENE: OK, that's reporter Joanna Kakissis speaking to us from Athens. Joanna, thanks.

KAKISSIS: You're welcome, David.

A look back at our coverage of what happened to Illinois police Lt. Charles Gliniewicz, who authorities now say killed himself, highlights the importance of attributing information and not getting ahead of ourselves when stories are breaking and investigations are under way.

Here are lines from five stories we aired or posted in the first few days after the news broke:

 Gliniewicz was shot to death in the line of duty on Tuesday  while chasing three suspects on foot.

 Investigators acknowledge they still only have vague descriptions of the three men Fox Lake police officer Charles Joseph Gliniewicz was trying to apprehend when he was shot and killed Tuesday morning.

 Lt. Gliniewicz was pursuing those suspectstwo white men and a black man on foot when he lost radio contact with a dispatcher.

 Before he was shot and killed Tuesday morning, Lt Charles Joseph Gliniewicz told dispatchers he was pursing three suspicious men on foot  two of them white and the third, black.

 The officer radioed to dispatchers that he was going to check on suspicious activity around 8 a.m. local time in the community of Fox Lake, Lake County sheriffs office spokesman Christopher Covelli said at a news conference. The officer, who has not yet been identified, then said he was in a foot pursuit, before losing contact. Covelli said responding officers arrived and found the officer injured from a gunshot wound and without his service weapon. The officer died at the scene.

The first three examples flatly say that Gliniewicz was chasing suspects when he was shot. The last two examples make it clear that Gliniewicz said he was in pursuit of three suspects.

Examples 1-3 skipped a key fact  that it was Gliniewicz who reported he was chasing three suspects. He was the source for that information. He was a single source. In hindsight, the attribution was critical.

Two other phrases in our early reports are interesting to think about now: Shot to death and shot and killed. Gliniewicz was shot. He did die. However, those phrases make it sound as if someone else did the shooting. If we had known he took his own life, we wouldnt have used them. We couldnt have known that, of course. But theres a case to be made that we should have thought through the possibilities and said before he was shot and died or some other phrasing that didnt include the word killed.

Mary Lattimore is a classically trained harpist from Philadelphia who incorporates experimental techniques and technologies into her music. She has performed and recorded with Kurt Vile, Sharon Van Etten, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth and Steve Gunn, among others; and is a frequent collaborator of Philly producer and multi-instrumentalist Jeff Zeigler. Lattimore's newest album, At the Dam, is the result of a prestigious fellowship she received in 2014 from the Pew Center for Arts & Heritage. She used the grant to fund a road trip across America with her harp and laptop, writing and recording songs at stops along the way, drawing inspiration from the locations, and letting the environments help define her work. The result is evocative, delicate and haunting music. The album is named for a Joan Didion essay about the Hoover Dam. ""It's enchanting, grandiose practicality, operating in its own solitude, even when humans aren't around,"" says Lattimore.

The tranquil ""Otis Walks Into the Woods"" was written in Marfa, Texas, after a visit to her family in North Carolina. About the song Lattimore says: ""I was traveling across the country with my great friend Natalie in my Volvo station wagon. I stopped home to see my parents in Polkville before picking up Natalie in Asheville. They live on the Lattimore family farm, which has some pastures, woods, a family cemetery, and have restored my great-grandfather's birthplace. We had a sweet blind black lab named Otis, an older dog, and he stuck close to the back door. The farm cats would sleep on his back and the other dog Gracie would nestle beside him. He was a cozy old guy. Before going to bed herself, my mom would let him inside to sleep on a blanket in the room off of the screened-in porch. After my visit, Natalie and I were driving through Louisiana and mom called to let me know that when she went to let Otis into the house that night, he was nowhere to be found. Dad went looking for him with Gracie and the flashlight, went deep into the woods to look for him, but he vanished without a trace. They looked and looked for weeks, but never saw a sign of him ever again. When Natalie and I got to Marfa, I set up to record at a friend's place and Otis was still on my mind, so I made him a song. I guess noble animals leave the pack to pass away in solitude and Otis, even being blind, found his way to where he wanted to go. It's a sad story but it's an ode to our pet.""

The video for ""Otis Walks Into the Woods"" captures a similarly peaceful, restful, elegant state of emotion. Shot and edited by Derrick Belcham, and choreographed and performed by Emily Terndrup and Maxwell Perkins. Lattimore says Belcham ""had this footage of dancers at the Philip Johnson Glass House, a place where I've played several times and I feel is an incredible gem."" The mini-movie captures a calm spirituality infused in Lattimore's repetitive, affecting music. It's a great match.

npr.org,,Iron Council,[],"Excerpt: Iron Council

Chapter One

A man runs. Pushes through thin bark-and-leaf walls, through the purposeless rooms of Rudewood. The trees crowd him. This far in the forest there are aboriginal noises. The canopy rocks. The man is heavy-burdened, and sweated by the unseen sun. He is trying to follow a trail.

Just before dark he found his place. Dim hotchi paths led him to a basin ringed by roots and stone-packed soil. Trees gave out. The earth was tramped down and stained with scorching and blood. The man spread out his pack and blanket, a few books and clothes. He laid down something well-wrapped and heavy among loam and centipedes.

Rudewood was cold. The man built a fire, and with it so close the darkness shut him quite out, but he stared into it as if he might see something emergent. Things came close. There were constant bits of sound like the bronchial call of a nightbird or the breath and shucking of some unseen predator. The man was wary. He had pistol and rifle, and one at least was always in his hand.

By flamelight he saw hours pass. Sleep took him and led him away again in little gusts. Each time he woke he breathed as if coming out of water. He was stricken. Sadness and anger went across his face.

""I'll come find you,"" he said.

He did not notice the moment of dawn, only that time skidded again and he could see the edges of the clearing. He moved like he was made of twigs, as if he had stored up the night's damp cold. Chewing on dry meat, he listened to the forest's shuffling and paced the dirt depression.

When finally he heard voices he flattened against the bank and looked out between the trunks. Three people approached on the paths of leaf-mould and forest debris. The man watched them, his rifle steadied. When they trudged into thicker shanks of light, he saw them clearly and let his rifle fall.

""Here,"" he shouted. They dropped foolishly and looked for him. He raised his hand above the earth rise.

They were a woman and two men, dressed in clothes more ill-suited to Rudewood than his own. They stood before him in the arena and smiled. ""Cutter."" They gripped arms and slapped his back.

""I heard you for yards. What if you was followed? Who else is coming?""

They did not know. ""We got your message,"" the smaller man said. He spoke fast and looked about him. ""I went and seen. We were arguing. The others were saying, you know, we should stay. You know what they said.""

""Yeah, Drey. Said I'm mad.""

""Not you.""

They did not look at him. The woman sat, her skirt filling with air. She was breathing fast with anxiety. She bit her nails.

""Thank you. For coming."" They nodded or shook Cutter's gratitude off: it sounded strange to him, and he was sure to them too. He tried not to make it sound like his sardonic norm. ""It means a lot."" * * * They waited in the sunken ground, scratched motifs in the earth or carved figures from dead wood. There was too much to say.

""So they told you not to come?""

The woman, Elsie, told him no, not so much, not in those words, but the Caucus had been dismissive of Cutter's call. She looked up at him and down quickly as she spoke. He nodded, and did not criticise.

""Are you sure about this?"" he said, and would not accept their desultory nods. ""Godsdammit are you sure? Turn your back on the Caucus? You ready to do that? For him? It's a long way we've got to go.""

""We already come miles in Rudewood,"" said Pomeroy.

""There's hundreds more. Hundreds. It'll be bastard hard. A long time. I can't swear we'll come back.""

I can't swear we'll come back.

Pomeroy said, ""Only tell me again your message was true. Tell me again he's gone, and where he's gone and what for. Tell me that's true."" The big man glowered and waited, and at Cutter's brief nod and closed eyes, he said, ""Well then.""

Others arrived then. First another woman, Ihona; and then as they welcomed her they heard stick-litter being destroyed in heavy leaps, and a vodyanoi came through the brush. He squatted in the froggish way of his race and raised webbed hands. When he jumped from the bank, his bodyhead and trunk all one fat sacrippled with impact. Fejhechrillen was besmirched and tired, his motion ill-suited to woodland.

They were anxious, not knowing how long they should wait, if any others would come. Cutter kept asking how they had heard his message. He made them unhappy. They did not want to consider their decision to join him: they knew there were many who would think it a betrayal.

""He'll be grateful,"" Cutter said. ""He's a funny bugger and might be he'll not show it, but this'll mean a lot, to me and to him.""

After silence Elsie said: ""You don't know that. He didn't ask us, Cutter. He just got some message, you said. He might be angry that we've come.""

Cutter could not tell her she was wrong. Instead he said: ""I don't see you leaving, though. We're here for us, maybe, as well as for him.""

He began to tell them what might be ahead, emphasising dangers. It seemed as if he wanted to dissuade them though they knew he did not. Drey argued with him in a rapid and nervy voice. He assured Cutter they understood. Cutter saw him persuading himself, and was silent. Drey said repeatedly that his mind was made up.

""We best move,"" said Elsie, when noon went. ""We can't wait forever. Anyone else is coming, they've obviously got lost. They'll have to go back to the Caucus, do what's needed in the city."" Someone gave a little cry and the company turned.

At the hollow's edge a hotchi rider was watching them, astride his gallus. The big war-cockerel plumped its breastfeathers and raised one spurred claw-foot in curious pose. The hotchi, squat and tough hedgehog man, stroked his mount's red comb.

""Militia coming."" His accent was strong and snarling. ""Two men militia coming, a minute, two."" He sat forward in the ornate saddle and turned his bird around. With very little sound, with no metal to jangle on wood-and-leather straps and stirrups, it picked away high-clawed and belligerent, and was hidden by the forest.

""Was that?"" ""What?"" ""Did you fucking?""

But Cutter and his companions were shushed by the sound of approach. They looked in unsaid panic, too late to hide.

Two men came stepping over fungused stumps into view. They were masked and uniformed in the militia's dark grey. Each had a mirrored shield and ungainly pepperpot revolver slack at his side. As they came into the clearing they faltered and were still, taking in the men and women waiting for them.

There was a dragged-out second when no one moved, when befuddled and silent conference was heldare you, are they, what, should we, should we?till someone shot. Then there were a spate of sounds, screams and the percussion of shots. People fell. Cutter could not follow who was where and was gut-terrified that he had been hit and not yet felt it. When the guns' heinous syncopation stopped, he unclenched his jaw.

Someone was calling Oh gods oh fucking gods. It was a militiaman, sitting bleeding from a belly-wound beside his dead friend and trying to hold his heavy pistol up. Cutter heard the curt torn-cloth sound of archery and the militia man lay back with an arrow in him and stopped his noise.

Again a beat of silence then ""Jabber"" ""Are you, is everyone?"" ""Drey? Pomeroy?""

First Cutter thought none of his own were hit. Then he saw how Drey was white and held his shoulder, and that blood dyed his palsying hands.

""Sweet Jabber, man."" Cutter made Drey sit (Is it all right? the little man kept saying.) Bullet had taken muscle. Cutter tore strips from Drey's shirt, and wound those cleanest around the hole. The pain made Drey fight, and Pomeroy and Fejh had to hold him. They gave him a thumb-thick branch to bite while they bandaged him.

""They must've fucking followed you, you halfwit bastards."" Cutter was raging while he worked. ""I told you to be fucking careful""

""We were,"" Pomeroy shouted, jabbing his finger at Cutter.

""Didn't follow them."" The hotchi reappeared, its rooster picking. ""Them patrol the pits. You been here long time, a day nearly."" It dismounted and walked the rim of the arena. ""You been too long.""

It showed the teeth in its snout in some opaque expression. Lower than Cutter's chest but rotundly muscular, it strutted like a bigger man. By the militia it stopped and sniffed. It sat up the one killed by its arrow and began to push the missile through the body.

""When them don't come back, them send more,"" it said. ""Them come after you. Maybe now."" It steered the arrow past bones through the dead chest. It gripped the shaft when it came out the corpse's back, and pulled the fletch through with a wet sound. The hotchi tucked it bloody into his belt, picked the revolving pistol from the militiaman's stiffening fingers and fired it against the hole.

Birds rose up again at the shot. The hotchi snarled with the unfamiliar recoil and shook its hand. The arrow's fingerthick burrow had become a cavity.

Pomeroy said: ""Godspit . . . who in hell are you?""

""Hotchi man. Cock-fighting man. Alectryomach. Help you.""

""Your tribe . . ."" said Cutter. ""They're with us? On our side? Some of the hotchi are with the Caucus,"" he said to the others. ""That's why this place's all right. Or was supposed to be. This lad's clan got no time for the militia. Give us passage. But . . . can't risk a real fight with the city, so they've to make it look like it was us killed the officers, not their arrows."" He understood as he said it.

Pomeroy and the hotchi rifled the killed men together. Pomeroy threw one of the pepperpot revolvers to Elsie, one to Cutter. It was modernistic and expensive and Cutter had never held one before. It was heavy, with its six barrels arranged in a fat rotating cylinder.

""They ain't reliable,"" said Pomeroy, harvesting bullets. ""Fast, though.""

""Jabber . . . we better fucking go."" Drey's voice went up and down with pain. ""Fucking guns going off going to call them for miles . . .""

""Not so many nearby,"" said the hotchi. ""Maybe none to hear. But you should gone, yes. What you for? Why leave city? You looking for him come by on the clay man?""

Cutter looked to the others and they watched him carefully, letting him speak.

He said: ""You seen him?"" He stepped toward the busy hotchi. ""You seen him?""

""Furo Wariboko awoke this morning to find that dreams can lose their way and turn up on the wrong side of sleep."" That's the first sentence of Blackass, the debut novel from Nigerian author A. Igoni Barrett, and if it sounds familiar, there's a good reason for that. The book is a long, bizarre riff on Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis, in which a salesman wakes up to find he's become an insect.

Furo's metamorphosis is markedly different: ""His hands were not black but white ... same as his legs, his belly, all of him."" His hair has become red; his eye color has changed to green. He's gone ""full oyibo,"" a Nigerian Pidgin word for a white person.

After realizing that he is not, in fact, dreaming, Furo panics. He has a job interview that he can't be late for, but he doesn't want his family to see how he's transformed. He's able to sneak out of the house that he shares with his parents and sister, and instantly draws stares as he walks to his prospective employer. ""Lone white face in a sea of black, Furo learned fast,"" Barrett writes. ""And he learnt how it felt to be seen as a freak: exposed to wonder, invisible to comprehension.""

Furo is shocked when he's instantly hired as a salesman for a book distributor. He encounters a woman named Syreeta, who lets him move in with her. And he befriends a writer named Igoni, who he meets in a shopping mall food court. Furo decides to embrace his new life as a white man (or mostly white  he learns, from Syreeta, that his buttocks have remained black). He changes his name to Frank Whyte, and throws himself into the bookselling business. He doesn't make contact with his family, who are trying desperately to find him.

It's obvious that Blackass is a satire; what's less clear is what exactly Barrett is satirizing. He does write beautifully, and sometimes humorously, on the topics of race and identity. Furo is initially homeless after he's hired at the company, and starts to question his previous assumptions: ""He had always thought that white people had it easier, in this country anyway, where it seemed that everyone treated them as special, but after everything that he had gone through since yesterday, he wasn't so sure any more.""

Barrett also has a lot to say about Nigeria, and the city of Lagos in particular, and these reflections are among the best parts of the book. ""Life in Lagos was locked in a constant struggle against empathy,"" he writes. ""Empathy was too much to ask for, too much to give: it was good only for beggars to exploit in their sob stories aimed at your pocket through your heart."" Barrett's depictions of Lagos are cutting, but also reluctantly admiring.

But the rest of Blackass gets mired down by the increasingly rambling plot. Furo's relationship with Syreeta is interesting, but Barrett's depiction of the young man's life at work is aimless and plodding; it almost feels like an afterthought.

It's obvious that 'Blackass' is a satire; what's less clear is what exactly Barrett is satirizing.

Perhaps the most bizarre sections of Blackass are the ones narrated by Igoni, who appears to be a fictional version of the author. (The character Igoni quotes lines from an interview he once gave, and they're nearly identical to ones from an interview Barrett did with Granta.) The character Igoni becomes obsessed with Furo's sister's Twitter account, and abruptly announces that he's transitioning to a woman. Neither of these things is ever really explained; they feel like another novel shoehorned into this one.

Barrett's writing is strong enough that it almost doesn't matter  it's an easy novel to read, very funny in places, and undoubtedly audacious. And he's capable of the kind of profundity that seems obvious, but really isn't: ""No one asks to be born, to be black or white or any colour in between, and yet the identity a person is born into becomes the hardest to explain to the world.""

It's a fascinating observation, and one that might explain why Blackass, though very good in parts, doesn't really work as a novel. Barrett definitely has great ideas and original observations, but it seems like he's tried too hard to force them all into one book. The result is a novel that's not unenjoyable, but one that never really comes together.",[]

The Dutch dentist was initially welcomed to the rural French town of Chateau-Chinon, which had been without a dental care provider for two years.

Then the horror stories started.

Now Jacobus Van Nierop is standing trial on charges of aggravated assault and insurance fraud, after scores of patients said he caused them injuries since arriving in town in 2008, Agence France-Presse reports. If found guilty, he could be sentenced to as many as 10 years in prison and fined up to $165,000, according to AFP.

The Associated Press has this account from a woman who said she was treated by the ""Dentist of Horror,"" as he has been dubbed in French media:

""One patient, Sylviane Boulesteix, has said she was unexpectedly summoned to the dental office in central-eastern France in May 2012. Without warning, the dentist pulled eight of her teeth out and immediately fixed dentures on her raw gums. For three hours, the elderly woman says she sat gushing blood. ""In the following days, she says Van Nierop refused to relieve her pain. A judicial expert later described a 'cruel and perverse' man whose incompetence made Boulesteix lose several healthy teeth, go through trauma and suffer irreversible damage to her mouth.""

According to AFP, some patients said they would wake to find notes asking them to come back for further treatment:

"" 'Every time, he would give us what he called 'a little prick' and we were asleep, knocked out,' said Nicole Martin, a retired teacher who lost several teeth to abscesses caused by the horrific operations. "" 'When it was over, we would find a Post-it note saying to come back for an appointment the next day or the day after,' she added.""

Martin set up a victims' group to press charges that grew to more than 120 members, according to AFP.

Van Nierop, 51, has said he ""suffers from 'psychological problems' including gender identity issues and suicidal tendencies,"" AFP reports.

He had a blanket over his head when he arrived today at the courthouse in the nearby city of Nevers, AFP reports. He has been incarcerated for the past 18 months.

""What my clients and I expect are explanations,"" Charles Joseph-Oudin, who is representing some of the victims, tells AFP. ""To understand how Mr. Van Nierop could have acted in such a way for so long, how things could have become so bad. Today, we have no explanations. Understanding is the first step of the victims' healing process.""

According to the AP, the defendant has ""refused to answer questions during the investigation, saying only that the oral health of the people in the region was 'deplorable.' ""

Van Nierop was arrested in 2013 but was released and then fled to Canada, AFP reports. He was found in New Brunswick in 2014, extradited to the Netherlands and then sent back to France to stand trial.

According to Vice, the Van Nierop case highlights the problem of France's 192 "" 'medical deserts'  areas where the authorities have failed to find successors for retiring doctors."" Vice says some 2.5 million people live in these areas.",[]

Videos and audio clips of someone being shot, a disaster victim crying for help, bodies being recovered and other potentially disturbing scenes present us with challenges.

When weighing whether to post such videos online and to use any clips on the air, keep in mind that:

 Conversations are required. The senior news manager on duty (a DME or the designated supervisor) must be consulted. The Visuals team should be pulled in. Other senior editors may be as well.

 The conversations start from this position: We report the news, good and bad.

 But we cant be callous. The video may show someones death. Out of respect for that person and that persons family, we consider carefully what should be shown or heard. Our general rule is that we do not post video or play audio of someones moment of death. There will be exceptions, but only after discussion.

 We also respect our audience. They want the facts. But for many, reading or hearing descriptions will be more than enough. Seeing or hearing disturbing events could leave them too shaken to follow the rest of a story.

 Every other news outlet else is using it is not on its own a justification for posting or broadcasting anything.

 Especially in the first minutes and hours after such content surfaces, its credibility may be in doubt. Proceed with caution.

 The content may be propaganda. For example, extremist groups spread their messages and try to spread terror by putting out videos of hostages being murdered. We do not blindly post or air propaganda. It would be highly unusual for us to even link to it.

Rigid rules about what to do wont work. Each situation is different. However:

 If its decided that videos with potentially disturbing content can be posted, they should never start automatically when a webpage loads. They must require a click to begin. They must either have a warning note embedded in them or it must appear directly above them.

 Likewise, on the air listeners should never hear potentially disturbing content without first being told that its coming. For instance, cellphone audio of gunshots that kill a man should not be heard until after a caution has been given.

 We should consider whether a videos disturbing moments and sounds can and should be blurred and bleeped, for posting online and using on the air.

 If the original content is too disturbing to post and we do not have a blurred/bleeped version that we are comfortable using, we may decide to link to another news outlets edited version if it is in line with our standards. We should caution readers that it includes potentially disturbing content. The language should be simple and clear. For example: The Daily Planet has posted a clip from the video here. Reminder: It is graphic.

 When a member station is chasing the same story, we should talk with the news director about how to handle the content. Often, well be in agreement and can link to the stations coverage.

But, But, But:

 Does this mean well never put such content online or on the air?

No. See above: We report the news, good and bad. We would not have edited a video of the Challenger explosion, for example, to blur the key moments.

 Are we treating the audience like children?

Some will say we are. We believe were making editorial judgments.

Note: The guidance above applies to images as well. We do not post potentially disturbing photos without first discussing.

For several decades, the band has innovated within itself and outside of extreme metal, culminating in last year's sonically wide-ranging Apex Predator  Easy Meat. ""Dear Slum Landlord"" was one of that album's most fascinating tracks, a dirge that oozes contempt for authority in eerily melodic riffs and Mark ""Barney"" Greenway's moans, which turn into a fierce bark.

A new video depicts evil slumlords in stark, black-and-white drawings that capture the way the public is devoured. Greenway writes NPR via email:

Being that this is a very queasy and deliberately monotone kind of song, we felt simplicity was the key with the video for ""Dear Slum Landlord."" Suitably, thanks to two production people in Oliver and Costin  who really understand the contrasting elements of Napalm Death  it's simple, desolate, black-and-white and just that little bit grim, befitting the subject matter of interconnected housing/labour exploitation which does its best to remain hidden from view.

More On The Album For more on the making of this album, including alternate takes, outtakes and stories behind the songs, visit the band's Tumblr page.

""I had a dream where you were standing there with a gun up to my head."" This is how Lucius drops us, in medias res, into ""Madness,"" the evocative first song on the band's second album, Good Grief. What unfolds is a lucid dream-chase sequence that captures a desire to pull the escape hatch and go on wild adventures full of danger and doomed affairs: ""Maybe I'll drive myself to madness / Spinning in circles, don't have it figured out just yet,"" Lucius' Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig sing in unison.

The two instantly won over fans with their gorgeous, joyful songs, not to mention their matching retro outfits and mod mirror-image haircuts  an eye-catching calling card that symbolizes the musical unity between Laessig and Wolfe and their bandmates, multi-instrumentalists Andrew Burri, Peter Lalish and Dan Molad. But as the group pushes its guitar-driven, folk-infused pop toward a broader, more sparkling palette, the blustery ballad provides a dramatic reintroduction.

Good Grief was written and recorded after two years on the road in support of 2013's fantastic Wildewoman  a period that saw the band blow up from Brooklyn favorite to an act capable of packing spacious music clubs, becoming a staple at summer festivals, and performing alongside musicians like Mavis Staples and Wilco's Jeff Tweedy. Produced with Shawn Everett and Bob Ezrin, Good Grief is invigorated by glitzy production that brims with sounds: pulsing analog keyboards (""Something About You""), trilling guitar lines (""Almighty Gosh"") and big '80s disco beats (""Almost Makes Me Wish For Rain""), all tailored to fill those sprawling venues. Nearly every song peaks with epic singalong choruses, led by Laessig and Wolfe as they belt their hearts out.

As rapturous as Good Grief feels in its catchiest moments, it's all in service to songs that touch on the dueling bittersweet experiences of love. Throughout the album, Lucius offers up intimate snapshots in the arc of a romance  from early excitement (""Born Again Teen"") to stormy fights and the lonely aftermath of ""My Heart Got Caught On Your Sleeve,"" wherein they lament, ""Smoked another cigarette, 'cause even though I quit / I'd do about just anything to pacify my own torment."" ""What We Have (To Change)"" begins simply with a stark piano and stirring close harmony, as they mull over the great lengths they'd go to rekindle a neglected relationship: ""Find me a mountain or any grand canyons / Just find us an igloo and I'll freeze with you,"" they offer in swooning unison.

The album reaches a climactic highlight in ""Gone Insane,"" which alludes to one of those all-too-real arguments where things cannot be unsaid.

i Matailong Du/NPR Matailong Du/NPR

In 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, by a vote of 8 to 1, to uphold a state's right to forcibly sterilize a person considered unfit to procreate. The case, known as Buck v. Bell, centered on a young woman named Carrie Buck, whom the state of Virginia had deemed to be ""feebleminded.""

Author Adam Cohen tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that Buck v. Bell was considered a victory for America's eugenics movement, an early 20th century school of thought that emphasized biological determinism and actively sought to ""breed out"" traits that were considered undesirable.

""There were all kinds of categories of people who were deemed to be unfit [to procreate],"" Cohen says. ""The eugenicists looked at evolution and survival of the fittest, as Darwin was describing it, and they believed 'We can help nature along, if we just plan who reproduces and who doesn't reproduce.' ""

All told, as many as 70,000 Americans were forcibly sterilized during the 20th century. The victims of state-mandated sterilization included people like Buck who had been labeled ""mentally deficient,"" as well as those who who were deaf, blind and diseased. Minorities, poor people and ""promiscuous"" women were often targeted.

Cohen's new book about the Buck case, Imbeciles, takes its name from the terms eugenicists used to categorize the ""feebleminded."" In it, he revisits the Buck v. Bell ruling and explores the connection between the American eugenics movement and the rise of the Nazi party in Germany.

Cohen notes that the instinct to ""demonize"" people who are different is still prevalent in the U.S. today, particularly in the debate over immigration.

""I think these instincts to say that we need to stop these other people from 'polluting us,' from changing the nature of our country, they're very real,"" Cohen warns. ""The idea that those who don't remember the past are condemned to repeat it  it's very troubling that we don't remember this past.""

Interview Highlights

On the case of Carrie Buck

This is this poor young woman, really nothing wrong with her physically or mentally, a victim of a terrible sexual assault, and there's a little hearing, she's declared feebleminded and she gets sent off to the colony for epileptics and feebleminded. ...

Imbeciles The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck by Adam Cohen Hardcover, 402 pages | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

When she's at the colony, the guy who is running the colony, Dr. Albert Priddy, is on the prowl. He's looking for someone to put at the center of this test case that they want to bring, so he's looking for someone to sterilize, and he sees Carrie Buck when she comes in, he does the examination himself, and there are a lot of things about her that excite him. She is deemed to be feebleminded, she has a mother who is feebleminded, so that's good because you can show some genetics, and then they're hoping that [her] baby could be determined to be feebleminded too, then you could really show a genetic pattern of feeblemindedness. The fact that she had been pregnant out of wedlock was another strike against her. So he fixes on her and thinks Carrie Buck is going to be the perfect potential plaintiff. ...

He chooses her, and then under the Virginia law, they have to have a sterilization hearing at the colony, which they do and they give her a lawyer (who is really not a lawyer for her; it's really someone who had been the chairman of the board of the colony and was sympathetic to the colony's side) and they have a bit of a sham hearing where she is determined to be a suitable person for sterilization; they vote to sterilize her, and that is the order that then gets challenged by Carrie as the plaintiff first in the Virginia court system and then in the Supreme Court.

On why he considers Buck v. Bell to be one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in American history

If you start by just looking at all the human misery that was inflicted, about 70,000 Americans were sterilized as a result of this decision, so that's an awful lot of people who wanted to have children who weren't able to have children. Also, we have to factor in all the many people who were being segregated, who were being held in these institutions for eugenic reasons, because they were feebleminded, whose lives unfolded living in places like the colony, rather than living in freedom. Beyond the human effect though, there was something just so ugly about this decision and when [we] think about what we want the Supreme Court to be, what the founders wanted the Supreme Court to be, it was supposed to be our temple of justice, the place that people could go when all the other parts of our society, all the other parts of the government, were not treating them right.

On how eugenicists sought to address the ""threat"" to the gene pool

The eugenicists saw two threats to the national gene pool: One was the external one, which they were addressing through immigration law; the other was the internal one  what to do about the people who were already here. They had a few ideas.

The first eugenics law in the United States was passed in Connecticut in 1895, and it was a law against certain kinds of marriages. They were trying to stop certain unfit people from reproducing through marriage. It wasn't really what they wanted, though, because they realized that people would just reproduce outside of marriage.

So their next idea was what they called segregation. The idea was to get people who were deemed unfit institutionalized during their reproductive years, particularly for women, keep them there, make sure they didn't reproduce, and then women were often let go when they had passed their reproductive years because they were no longer a threat to the gene pool. That had a problem too, though. The problem was that it would be really expensive to segregate, institutionalize the number of people the eugenicists were worried about. ...

Their next idea was eugenic sterilization and that allowed for a model in which they would take people in to institutions, eugenically sterilize them, and then they could let them go, because they were no longer a threat. That's why eugenic sterilization really became the main model that the eugenicists embraced and that many states enacted laws to allow.

On deeming people ""feebleminded""

""Feebleminded"" was really the craze in American eugenics. There was this idea that we were being drowned in a tide of feeblemindedness  that basically unintelligent people were taking over, reproducing more quickly than the intelligent people  but it was also a very malleable term that was used to define large categories of people that again, were disliked by someone who was in the decision-making position. So, women who were thought to be overly interested in sex, licentious, were sometimes deemed feebleminded. It was a broad category and it was very hard to prove at one of these feeblemindedness hearings that you were not feebleminded.

On the involuntary sterilization procedure

For men it was something like a vasectomy. For women it was a salpingectomy, where they cauterized the path that the egg takes toward fertilization. It was, in the case of women, not minor surgery and when you read about what happened, it's many, many days of recovery and it had certain dangers attached to it, and a lot of the science was still quite new. ...

When you add onto all that, the fact that in many, many cases the women involved were not told what was being done to them, they might be told that they were having an appendectomy, they weren't being told that the government has decided that you are unfit to reproduce and we're then going to have surgery on you, so that just compounds the horror of the situation.

On how the Nazis borrowed from the U.S. eugenics sterilization program

We really were on the cutting edge. We were doing a lot of this in the 1910s and 1920s. Indiana adopted a eugenic sterilization law, America's first in 1907. We were writing the eugenics sterilization statutes that decided who should be sterilized. We also had people who were writing a lot of what might be thought of as pro-Aryan theory. So you have people like Madison Grant who wrote a very popular book called The Passing of a Great Race, which really talked about the superiority of Nordics, as he called them, and how they were endangered by all the brown people and the non-Nordics who were taking over.

On a 1924 immigration law, which was inspired by eugenicists, that prevented Anne Frank's family from entering the U.S.

Under the old immigration laws where it was pretty much ""show up,"" they would've been able to emigrate, but suddenly they were trapped by very unfavorable national quotas, so this really was a reason that so many Jews were turned away.

One very poignant aspect of it that I've thought about as I was working on the book is in the late '90s some correspondence appeared, was uncovered, in which Otto Frank was writing repeatedly to the State Department begging for visas for himself and his wife and his two daughters, Margot and Anne, and was turned down, and that was because there were now these quotas in place. If they had not been, it seems clear that he would've been able to get a visa for his whole family, including his daughter Anne Frank.

So when we think about the fact that Anne Frank died in a concentration camp, we're often told that it was because the Nazis believed the Jews were genetically inferior, that they were lesser than Aryans. That's true, but to some extent Anne Frank died in a concentration camp because the U.S. Congress believed that as well.",[]

toggle caption Xinhua News Agency

It took Abdul Arian months to realize that his decision to migrate from his home country, Afghanistan, to Germany was a huge mistake.

He set off nearly a year ago, hoping to be granted asylum so that he could go to university and study psychology.

His journey, organized by smugglers, was long and perilous. Arian, 24, says he nearly drowned off the shores of Greece, when the inflatable dinghy he was traveling in capsized.

He says he and his fellow travelers got lost somewhere in Hungary and walked through the rain for 24 hours before they found the path again.

Yet the reason that Arian finally saw his mistake was not because something nasty or dangerous happened to him. It was because nothing really happened at all.

When Arian arrived in Germany, he was placed in a migrants' reception center.

""We had nothing to do in the camp,"" he says. ""We just stayed there.""

He played a lot of soccer. He ate a lot of jelly sandwiches. He moped about. Officials wrote down his name. In the end, he says, he was in Germany for 10 months, yet ""no one asked me why I went there and why I was there."" No one seemed to want to listen to him explain why he should be allowed to stay.

It also soon became clear to Arian that local Germans did not appreciate his presence. While people from the church and social workers helped the migrants and were ""very nice,"" residents of the nearby village seemed hostile.

""When we were walking along the sidewalk, people would avoid us,"" says Arian.

Germany Says Many Must Leave

Last year, 150,000 Afghans arrived in Germany. The German authorities estimate less that half qualify for asylum.

German officials say at present a tiny number of Afghans  1,600, according to estimates given to them by Afghan officials in Germany  are willing to go back home voluntarily.

But many will have to leave, says Germany's ambassador to Afghanistan, Markus Potzel.

""It means that more than half of them have to be sent back because they can't stay,"" says Potzel. ""There are some obstacles for them to be sent back immediately, but we have a huge number of Afghans who are not eligible to stay in Germany and should be sent back.""

During Arian's time in Germany, he began to notice that Syrian migrants were being treated very differently. They were provided with language lessons and eventually passports, he says.

""When we complained to the social workers, they responded frankly. They said, 'We've invited Syrians here, not Afghans,' "" he says.

This prompted some of Arian's fellow Afghans to stage demonstrations.

""They were shouting, 'We don't want to go back to Afghanistan! There is a war there!' "" he says. ""But no one listened to them.""

The weeks rolled by. Arian was moved to another center. But still nothing happened. He grew steadily more convinced that he had no chance of being allowed to stay in Germany. Then depression set in.

""I was in very bad condition. I couldn't sleep. I decided to go back to Afghanistan, before I went crazy,"" he says.

Arian returned home last month. He was one of 125 Afghans sent back to Afghanistan on a charter flight organized by the German and Afghan governments. The passengers all signed a form saying they were returning voluntarily.

Arian's family spent most of their savings on his trip to Germany. To pay the smuggler's bill of $7,500, they sold land and a car. Arian is now worrying about what his family feels about that.

""So far, I haven't seen any reaction from them because I've just arrived back. But I don't know what's in their hearts,"" he says.

Arian is faced with finding work amid rampant unemployment in a society where good jobs are very hard to find without political or personal connections  or cash for a hefty bribe.

Humiliation For Some

That much is clear from the experience of Shirdil Bayat, 40. He was deported from Denmark two years ago, after a court rejected his request for asylum  which he'd based on a claim that his life was threatened by the Taliban in his home city, Kandahar.

Lacking personal connections, Bayat took 16 months to find permanent work as an office cleaner in the capital, Kabul. He says returning home to Kandahar is still too risky. On a recent day when he was interviewed by NPR, he'd been laid off because of budget cuts. He says he has no idea what he'll do next.

Bayat says returning to Afghanistan after having failed in Europe can be very humiliating. Some families are sympathetic, but far from all.

""People jeer at you. They ask, 'Why did so-and-so get citizenship in Europe while you did not? Maybe you're useless,' "" he says.

The Germans are running a PR campaign in Afghanistan, trying to deter Afghans from traveling to their land. They've posted announcements on billboards, buses and the Internet, urging Afghans to think twice before setting off.

Germany views many of the Afghans who've arrived on its soil as economic migrants seeking jobs or education.

German officials maintain that under international law, Germany is not required to grant asylum to those migrants  unlike Syrians, who are fleeing a war zone.

The United Nations estimates that last year, some 11,000 civilians were killed or injured by conflict in Afghanistan. Afghans say that bolsters proof that there is war in Afghanistan, too  and that Afghans should therefore be granted protection by European nations.

""Afghans are not leaving Afghanistan because of a lack of jobs, "" says Ashraf Haidari, director-general of policy and strategy at Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry. ""They are fleeing generalized violence. Terrorism that is killing men, women and children,"" he says. ""That - and political uncertainty as a result of withdrawal of international forces and diminishing international development aid.""

Germany Draws A Distinction

However, Potzel, Germany's ambassador, says the situation in Afghanistan differs hugely from Syria's.

""Here in Afghanistan, you don't have a government who would bomb their own population,"" he says. ""Here, the government tries to protect their own people. There are unsafe regions and there are less unsafe regions in Afghanistan, and there are regions  especially in the big cities  where a sort of normal life is going on.""

Germany is one of the main international donors to Afghanistan. Over the last 14 years, it has poured a great deal of money into the country. It seems unlikely that it would wish to risk making Afghanistan still more unstable by forcibly returning large numbers of Afghans over a short time span.

Yet there is considerable concern in Afghanistan about what might happen if significant numbers of angry and disillusioned young Afghans are eventually sent back from Europe.

Some European countries provide financial support packages to help people settle in, but the sums are generally small and over a limited time period.

Professor Sayed Masoud, an economist based in Kabul, foresees ""disaster.""

""Either they will join the Taliban or become drug addicts,"" he says, ""because the government can't provide jobs.""

Meanwhile, Afghans keep heading on the trail to Europe. On a recent early morning in Kabul, hundreds of men were lined up outside the government office that issues passports.

Among them was Wahidullah Mohammadi, 19, who wants to migrate to Europe to go to school. He is aware of the risk of being deported back home  and of losing the thousands of dollars he'll pay to smugglers.

Still, he still thinks the odds are worth it.

""The situation is not good here and there is no guaranteed future,"" he says. ""This is why I have to accept this risk.""",[]

It's a gift idea for all your friends and loved ones who want, let's say, a cumbersome, frustrating, time-consuming present this holiday season, one that can take up an entire room.

ADRIAN CHESTERMAN: Yeah. It's massive.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

We're talking about a puzzle, a 33,600-piece jigsaw puzzle. It's 18 feet long, 5 feet wide and weighs more than 35 pounds.

CORNISH: Yikes.

SHAPIRO: The image on it is a fantasy forest with every imaginable animal. It's called ""Wilderness.""

CORNISH: ""Wilderness"" is the creation of Adrian Chesterton (sic). He's an artist living in Spain. He says he's done lots of other puzzles.

CHESTERMAN: But I've never done one this big. They're usually about a thousand-piece, 1,500 pieces. But (laughter) obviously, 33,600 is kind of an exception.

CORNISH: Chesterton (sic) says this enormous jigsaw puzzle is just the latest volley in an ever-escalating battle.

CHESTERMAN: There's a company in Germany called Ravensburger, and the company I did this for is Spanish, called Educa Borras. And Educa Borras and Ravensburger have been competing to who has the biggest jigsaw puzzle in the world for the last 10 years. So one produced one of at 8,000, and then the other produced one at 10 and then at 12. And it leapt to 16, and then it went to 18 and then 24. This is like a game of tennis. And the last one was Ravensburger - did a 25,000-pieces puzzle.

SHAPIRO: Adrian Chesterton (sic) would like his town to sponsor an event for charity and get schoolchildren to complete this monstrous puzzle. And then he wants the competition to make an ever-bigger puzzle to end.

CHESTERMAN: I mean. it's getting so silly. You'd need a house the size - I mean, you'd have to be the queen of England or - I don't know - live in a house the size of the White House.

CORNISH: That's Adrian Chesterton (sic). His artwork is featured on the world's largest jigsaw puzzle. It's called ""Wilderness."" And by the way, he hasn't assembled it himself because he's too busy. He told us the most recent jigsaw puzzle he solved had just 12 pieces.

There were incidents at high school basketball games where fans chanted ""build a wall"" at teams made up of minority students. David Greene talks to Washington Post sports columnist Kevin Blackistone.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

There was a basketball game last month near Gary, Ind. Two Catholic high schools were playing, and some students began to chant, Trump, Trump, and build a wall. They were chanting at the rival team which was mostly Hispanic. There was a similar incident in Iowa not long before that - also a high school basketball game, also involving a team made up of minority players. In both cases, school and community leaders quickly denounced the incidents, but we've been wondering what those incidents tell us about the campaign and maybe the country. Kevin Blackistone, sports columnist at The Washington Post and journalism professor at the University of Maryland is on the line via Skype.

Kevin, good morning. Welcome back to the program.

KEVIN BLACKISTONE: Thank you David. How're you doing?

GREENE: I'm well, thank you. What did you make of those basketball games?

BLACKISTONE: Well, it's very disturbing. You know, time has shown that generally it is sports language and discourse that kind of seeps into our political discussions.

GREENE: Like using a term like, Hail Mary, or something like that.

BLACKISTONE: Exactly. And this time, we happened to see it the other way around, which tells me a couple of things. One, that the course - discourse of this political season has really reached deep into the fabric of our society when kids at a high school game have picked up upon it. And also, it's disturbing that they would pick up on the absolute worst part of this discourse and turn it into verbal weaponry against kids of color. That's very, very disturbing.

GREENE: And I guess it's really important to point out - I mean, this is obviously not something that Donald Trump or his campaign would have been responsible for, these are people just using his name in an environment like this. I guess I'm just so struck because not so, so long ago - I mean, I was going to my high school basketball games. I don't remember talking about politics or using campaign slogans or names of candidates at all.

BLACKISTONE: No, and it may be a reflection of social media, or it may be a reflection of the way that we've - we in the media have come to cover this political campaign. It has been 24-7 on any number of networks. It has seeped into late-night television as entertainment. It is everywhere. On the one hand, I would embrace this if in fact this means that teenagers who soon will be of voting age have become very, very interested in our political process, but on the other hand, I'm just very, very disturbed about the part of the campaign that they've picked up. And, you know, if you look to Europe or even South America to see how sports and politics have oftentimes been married into the hooliganism that you see in soccer that oftentimes has been organized around fascist politics...

GREENE: You're talking about some of the violent riots we've seen, like, at soccer games and so forth in Europe and South America.

BLACKISTONE: Exactly. And particularly, we saw it back in Yugoslavia when it was disintegrating in the early 1990s. I don't want to elevate high school - what I'd like to dismiss as high school pranks - to that level, but nonetheless, if you see it in high school sports, where will you see it next in our sporting landscape?

GREENE: All right. We'll have to stop there.

Kevin, thanks so much for joining us, as always.

BLACKISTONE: Thanks for the invite.

Most people remember the first time they fall in love. In this excerpt from ""Modern Love: The Podcast,"" the author writes about the actual fall that marked her first love.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Now for a story about falling in love, and not just figuratively. In 2012, Natalie Lindeman went on a first date and she fell a hundred feet down a mountainside into a canyon. Lindeman wrote about her date, that fall and what happened next in an essay for the popular New York Times Sunday column ""Modern Love."" Now, NPR member station WBUR and The New York Times have collaborated to produce ""Modern Love: The Podcast,"" which turns those columns into an experience for the ear.

Here, actor Dakota Fanning reads Natalie Lindeman's essay, ""The Plunge.""

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DAKOTA FANNING: (Reading) Last summer, I fell 100 feet into one of the steepest canyons in the United States. After tumbling 75 feet down the near-vertical canyon side, I dropped another 25 feet in freefall, landing in a dry stream bed between granite boulders.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) I have always loved falling. When I was 3, my favorite game was mantle jumping. My dad would place me on the mantle, steady me and step back. I'd push off and fall for that perfect rush of a second before he caught me, swinging me to the ground. In high school, I found a teenage version of mantle jumping by leaping off high, rocky cliffs with my friends into the ocean below. I loved the way the wind whistled in my ears, making me feel so alive. Yet if I was passionate about adventure, I was cautious about passion. A boyfriend would only slow me down.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) Then near the end of my junior year of high school, a senior named Wilder asked me to prom, and I said yes. Right after I said yes though, my heart started pounding and I raced into an empty classroom to breathe for a minute alone. The smile on my face was so big it hurt. I was determined to keep things casual as we headed out on our first real date.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) To escape the early summer heat, we decided to hike the sage-lined trail to the waterfall in Eaton Canyon. Dozens of hikers were already splashing in the pool when college-age hiker asked if we had heard of the second waterfall only a mile beyond. Although the path was unmarked, we tramped another 20 minutes up the steep incline and found it, beautiful and isolated. It was so easy to be with him. We were coming around a curve in the canyon wall, hurrying to get back while it was still light. Wilder went first, searching for notches and footholds, finally making it around. Then I went, feeling for handholds, my face inches from the rock. I traced to where he had grasped, reaching back with my left foot, searching for the ledge. And suddenly, I wasn't holding onto anything. Sandy grit was skittering down the mountain alongside me. I was falling.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) I woke up to the sound of helicopter blades. A cable carried me into the air. It struck me; I had just fallen, and now they were taking me up even higher. My dad found me in the too-bright emergency room and tried to hold my hands, but they were a bloody mess like the rest of me. Wilder's in the waiting room, he said. Nurses cut away my clothes with giant scissors and wiped the dirt and blood from my body. I heard scattered phrases - 100 feet, fractured vertebrae, a miracle. Wilder visited as soon as he was allowed. You're off the hook, I said. What do you mean, he asked? I explained in my drugged speech that he didn't have to come to the hospital or hang out with a broken girl all summer. No guilt. I'd call him when I was healed and back to normal. He stayed with me until a nurse kicked him out.

Five days later, I was home. Doctors said I would have to wear a corset-like brace from my hips to my neck for eight to 12 weeks, and then we could talk about recuperation. Sitting up for 20 minutes exhausted me, and I could barely move without wincing in pain.

Wilder kept visiting, and it scared the hell out of me. I fought to look like the girl he had asked to prom. I looked as if I had been mauled by a tiger, but the brace covered most of it. I'd laugh, roll out of bed and walk around as if keeping in constant motion would prove I was strong, independent and unhurt. I figured he'd leave while I slept, but I'd doze off listening to him playing basketball with my little brother and when I'd wake up, he'd be eating dinner with my family.

Sometimes I think my body saved itself that day by learning to surrender, that those years of falling prepared me to relax into the 100-foot plunge. But it was weeks after the fall before I could truly let go. I thought I could use my injuries as an excuse to push Wilder away. I thought I could forget the look on his face as I fell and ignore the terrified feeling of longing in my chest. But I couldn't. Maybe it was the way he said, I'd rather spend my summer with you than any other girl. Maybe it was how being around him made me forget the brace and the wounds, made me feel whole and unbroken. Finally, surrender became not just inevitable but exhilarating. I didn't want to hold onto anything anymore. I wanted to fall, and I already had. And I knew that this time, too, I would be OK.

MARTIN: That was Dakota Fanning reading Natalie Lindeman's essay, ""The Plunge,"" for WBUR and The New York Times's ""Modern Love: The Podcast.""

Appearing at a Cruz rally in Miami on Wednesday morning, Fiorina said she voted for Cruz in Virginia's recent primary, and praised his record in challenging Washington's status quo.

Calling Cruz a ""real constitutional conservative,"" she said ""he is a fearless fighter and reformer, and he didn't care much whether he got invited to the cocktail parties in Washington, D.C."" Fiorina said.

npr.org,,"On Why Its Not OK To Ask Friends, Family Or Fixers To Take Photos For Us",[],"On Why Its Not OK To Ask Friends, Family Or Fixers To Take Photos For Us

Heres what everyone needs to know: When on assignment, do not turn to friends, family members, freelance producers or foreign fixers and ask them to take a picture to go with the digital version of your story.

This has been happening in recent months and as the Visuals team notes, its a problem. Among the issues:

 In most cases, the people being asked to take photographs are not trained journalists, so NPR may not be able to vouch for the journalistic integrity of their image-making.

 In some cases, the person whos been asked to take a photo is being employed by NPR to do a very specific job. Because the photo-making is not negotiated ahead of time, its asking someone to do more work than theyve signed on to do.

 Why not just pay them another $50? Well, the budget for photos is limited, so Visuals must carefully weigh whether to hire a photographer to cover any particular story. If the budget gets drained by ad hoc arrangements, we may not be able to hire professionals for other stories.

 Whats wrong with having your son or daughter come along to take photos? Asking minors to work for us raises child labor issues, liability issues and ethical issues.

We understand that it can be hard to collect tape and make images and do everything else that goes into being a multi-platform journalist. Heres what the Visuals team asks:

If reporters think they wont be able to handle gathering images in the field on their own, they and their editors should come to us and well figure out a solution. If a story warrants original imagery, that decision and hire should be made by a photo editor on the Visuals team.

Meanwhile, everyone should be on notice that photos taken by my friend Buzz or my nephew whos really good with a camera will be turned down for one or more of the reasons above.

Bottom line: Its important to remember that all assets for stories gathered in the field should be collected by NPR journalists, or NPR-commissioned journalists. The images that go with our reports are important. Think about it this way: Would you hand a microphone to that precocious niece of yours and have her do some interviews?

npr.org,,Guidance: On Station Reporters & News About Their Universities Or Institutions,[],"Guidance: On Station Reporters & News About Their Universities Or Institutions

When there is news involving the university or institution that holds an NPR member stations license, conflicts of interest  perceived and actual  must be considered. So NPR editors ask questions:

 Is it a breaking news situation in which a station reporter could be our eyes on the ground and voice from the scene? Also is it a story that is about an event more than the institution? In recent years, this has happened most often when an institution is on lock-down because of a shooting or reports of a shooter. We would likely want to hear from a station reporter in our Newscasts and on our news magazines about what is happening.

 Is it a story that involves the institution but is not really about the institution? A recent example was the death of North Carolina basketball coach Dean Smith. We felt it would not be a problem for a station reporter to file an obit-type report for us. Yes, Smith was a towering figure at the university. But he was not controversial in the way that Joe Paterno, for example, became at Penn State. There wasnt anything about his time at UNC that we felt would give the appearance of a conflict if a station reporter was on our air. Bottom line: the news was about Smith, not the school.

 Is it a story about that institution? In such cases, we consider very carefully whether it would look like there was a conflict of interest if a station reporter files for us. We err on the side of caution. We know that listeners/readers may rightfully question whether a reporter who is paid by an institution should report about it. For example, if a schools football coach was under fire for putting a football player back on the field too soon after a concussion  leading to calls for the coachs firing and questions about the universitys response  that is a story we would not want to take from a station reporter at the school. The Penn State/Jerry Sandusky story was another that we felt should not be covered, on our airwaves, by a reporter from the schools station.

 Has the nature of a story shifted? Heres an example: While a station reporter is likely the logical person to use in the first hours after a campus shooting, that reporter and his/her station probably are not the right person or place to turn if questions start to come up about the universitys response to the incident.

We cant anticipate every possibility. The discussion above is designed to offer general guidelines and recent examples of how things have been handled. Situations will be considered case-by-case.

These things dont change from story to story: We value and need the solid reporting that member stations provide. We start with the assumption that we want to use their reports. Sometimes we may need to say no. But at all times we want to talk through the issues.

We have worked with some station-based news directors and PRNDI on the guidelines above; we welcome more feedback about our thinking and this guidance.

i toggle caption Dieter Endlicher/AP Dieter Endlicher/AP

Nancy Reagan, the influential and stylish former first lady who died on Sunday at 94, was fond of saying: ""A woman is like a tea bag. You never know how strong it is until it's in hot water.""

Reagan was merely quoting a line attributed to another first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt (though historians have never confirmed whether Roosevelt said it).

Reagan got a chance to test that quip at the 1985 Geneva Summit, when she met the first lady of the Soviet Union, Raisa Gorbachev, over tea, at two tensely choreographed tete-a-tetes.

While their husbands discussed nuclear disarmament  this meeting was the first step in a historical detente that would end with the fall of the Wall  the two wives chatted over tea.

The press hyped the tea parties as the ""Tea Summit."" After all, Gorbachev, a political science lecturer, was called ""the Kremlin's secret weapon,"" and everyone knew that Reagan was not only her husband's most trusted adviser, but that it was she who had encouraged him to talk to the Russians.

Reagan played host first, inviting Gorbachev to tea at the beautiful lakeside mansion loaned to the Reagans by the Aga Khan. Things didn't start well. Gorbachev's long motorcade rolled up 15 minutes late, a tardiness bitterly noted by the waiting journalists whiplashed by the icy November winds.

Matters scarcely improved inside when Gorbachev began to behave like the Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland. ""When she didn't like the chair she was seated in, she snapped her fingers to summon her KGB guards, who promptly moved her to another chair,"" recounted a startled Reagan in her memoirs, My Turn. ""After sitting in the new spot for a couple of minutes, she decided she didn't like that one either, so she snapped her fingers and they moved her again."" But since the imperious behavior was not repeated, Reagan correctly chalked it up to nerves.

""I offered Raisa a choice of coffee or decaffeinated almond tea, my personal favorite,"" wrote Reagan. ""She chose the tea and seemed to enjoy it.""

Surprisingly, given the strained atmosphere, the visit lasted more than an hour, but neither the freshly baked cookies nor the crackling fire could rescue the ""dry, impersonal and tedious"" conversation.

""She was lecturing me about Communism, and I couldn't wait for her to stop,"" recalls an exasperated Reagan.

Although Reagan tried to make out that it had all gone marvelously, telling the press that her guest had ""talked a lot about Russia and the expanse of Russia, and the different sections and climates of Russia,"" her irritation was apparent. ""I discussed my children,"" she said. ""We didn't get around to her children, maybe tomorrow.""

At 4 p.m. sharp the next afternoon, Reagan arrived at the Soviet Mission, a boxy, officelike building. She was surprised to see the glamorous ""Bo Derek of the Steppes,"" as the press called Gorbachev, dressed ""like a prison matron"" in a black skirt, a white shirt and a black tie. Soon enough she understood why: ""They were taking the only photograph of her at the Geneva Summit that would be shown back home.""

Gorbachev was still smarting from the criticism she had received from the Soviet press about her recent visit to Paris, where she had hobnobbed with the bourgeois capitalist designers Pierre Cardin and Yves Saint Laurent. It had earned her the catty epithet of ""Gucci comrade""  something she was determined to avoid this time.

But though both the U.S. and USSR assiduously projected the first ladies' teas as serious business devoted to promoting peace, the press continued to compare Reagan's sheer stockings with Gorbachev's opaque ones.

The Russian tea came with an hors de 'oeuvre of propaganda. After being dragged through children's drawings decorating the hall, with her host providing a granular commentary on each sketch, Reagan felt ""condescended to.""

""I wanted to say, 'Enough. You don't have to tell me what a missile is. I get the message.' ""

She brightened, however, at the sight of the sumptuous spread laid out for her. ""On the table was a lovely antique samovar, and next to it was a mouth-watering array of delicacies: blinis with caviar, cabbage rolls, blueberry pie, cookies, chocolates, honey and jam. I couldn't possibly try everything, and I finally had to give up.""

Gorbachev called it ""a typical Russian tea,"" provoking a sarcastic riposte in Reagan's memoirs: ""If that was an ordinary housewife's tea, then I'm Catherine the Great.""

Both women were no doubt relieved when the tea charade ended. They would meet again in Washington and Moscow; both meetings were strained affairs, and despite them holding hands in public  a Russian custom  few were fooled. All the hot tea they drank failed to dispel the chill between them.

Tea Tuesdays is an occasional series exploring the science, history, culture and economics of this ancient brewed beverage.

He lives vicariously through himself. He has won the lifetime achievement award, twice. In museums, he is allowed to touch the art. He is ...

... out of a job.

Since 2006, Jonathan Goldsmith has played The Most Interesting Man In The World in a popular series of ads for Dos Equis. His catchphrase  ""I don't always drink beer. But when I do, I prefer Dos Equis""  has worked its way into Internet culture.

YouTube

But his reign is ending. The newest ad for Dos Equis shows Goldsmith, as the Most Interesting Man, taking off in a spaceship on a one-way trip to Mars.

Executives from Heineken USA, which owns Dos Equis, told Ad Age that the ad campaign will continue with a new actor.

""They declined to [identify] the new star, or share details about ad plotlines, other than to say they are seeking to contemporize the campaign,"" the trade magazine reports.

Ad Age also reports that, according to the beer company, the switch is not related to Goldsmith's recent legal dispute with a former agent.

Last year, NPR's Danny Hajek spoke with Goldsmith about his career before Dos Equis  which included a stint as a garbage truck driver, a series of villainous appearances in Westerns and years spent outside of Hollywood altogether.

He tried out for the Most Interesting Man role at the suggestion of his then-agent and now wife, Barbara ... with some posthumous help from his friend Fernando Lamas, an Argentine-born actor, whose accent he adopted for the role.

His Fernando impression delighted the audition room, but Goldsmith almost didn't get the part. Here's more from the NPR interview:

""Barbara received a call from Joe Blake, the casting director. He told Barbara that they loved Goldsmith's performance, but they felt like they had to go younger. "" 'And in her infinite wisdom, she took a long pause and she said, ""Joe, how can the most interesting man in the world be young?""' Goldsmith says. 'He said, ""I'll get back to you."" ' ""Soon after, the casting director called back. He got the part.""

And as for his now-retired character, blasting off into space in an impeccable tuxedo?

""His only regret,"" the voiceover says, ""is not knowing what regret feels like.""",[]

Named for the dystopian city in Akira, ""Neo Tokyo"" opens the album in typical Perturbator fashion: Heavy cyberpunk synths deliver savage four-on-the-floors with soaring Gothic melodies. This is where Kent excels, for sure, but here, his sense of texture and composition gives more weight to the finer details. Crank the bass and there's something truly disorienting about those subs, which in lesser hands might just be noise. After a glitching break, a tonal shift occurs that breaks up the darkness for just the briefest moment before giving way to cacophonous strings.

While most of the country would be happy never to hear the word ""Deflategate"" ever again, people named Goodell are still very concerned with the year-old scandal and whether New England Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady tampered with game balls.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell  whose four-game suspension of Brady was overturned by a judge  is likely keeping a close eye on the Deflategate case as it winds its way through federal appeals court. But there's another Goodell committed to proving Brady didn't do it.

Ben Goodell, a seventh-grader from Lynn, Mass., dedicated his science fair project to measuring how weather conditions affected the PSI [pounds per square inch] of footballs in a bid to prove the Patriots did nothing illicit.

""I wanted to prove that Tom Brady is innocent,"" the 12-year-old St. Pius V Elementary School student, who isn't related to the NFL commissioner, told local TV station NECN.

And his project won.

Goodell was one of approximately 120 students who participated in the school's annual science fair, and one of only eight to win the Outstanding Project Award, according to The Daily Item. The newspaper reports Goodell began his experiment with a football inflated to the NFL standard and then exposed it to different weather conditions, including humidity, snow, wind chill, cold and ice.

""Every time, it dropped two PSI [pounds per square inch],"" Goodell, a Patriots fan, told the Item. ""The lowest PSI recorded during deflategate was 2 PSI under proper inflation.""

Principal Paul D. Maestranzi said the goal of the science fair is to get students to try and answer an everyday question.

""It's more tied in with current thinking,"" he told the newspaper. ""I think some people think science is only in a laboratory. It's really all around us all the time. That's what gets kids hooked: relevance.""

So, kudos to Ben Goodell for his experiment. Hopefully, Deflategate  the stale and bungled controversy that it is  will soon cease to be relevant.",[]

John Powers reviews a new graphic novel that he describes as an astonishing work of imagination by the Singaporean writer and illustrator Sonny Liew. It's called The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. Our critic-at-large John Powers has a review of a new graphic novel that he describes as an astonishing work of imagination. It's by the Singaporean writer and illustrator Sonny Liew, who was born in Malaysia, studied philosophy at Cambridge University and is best known in the U.S. for his DC Comics series Doctor Fate about an Egyptian-American superhero. His new graphic novel, his biggest and most ambitious work, spans decades. Here's John's review of ""The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye.""

JOHN POWERS, BYLINE: It wasn't so long ago that comics were considered artistically marginal, adolescent fantasy. All that changed with the 1986 release of ""Maus."" Art Spiegelman's graphic novel - as they're now called - tackled the Holocaust and its effect on his family. ""Maus"" won a Pulitzer Prize and unleashed the ongoing wave of masterful books that includes Alan Moore's ""Watchmen,"" Chris Ware's ""Jimmy Corrigan"" and Allison Bechdel's ""Fun Home."" Grappling with everything from sex and politics to violence and alienation, these comics took you places that you haven't gone before.

That happens again in ""The Art of ""Charlie Chan Hock Chye,"" a startlingly brilliant tour de force by the Singapore artist and writer Sonny Liew. Although the premise sounds simple - it's the biography of a fictional comic book artist - what Liew does with it is anything but. At once dizzyingly meta and deeply heartfelt, the book spans 80 years and in its complicated layering remind me of everything from ""Maus"" and ""The Tin Drum"" to, believe it or not, ""Ulysses.""

The book's hero is Chan Hock Chye. His English-language name in a little joke is Charlie. Chan is born in 1938 Singapore. And from the beginning, this shopkeeper's son loves to draw. When he first discovers comic books at the local library, he's forever smitten. He dedicates his whole life to making them, becoming a monk of the craft. Never married, he turns down commercial jobs to spend decades creating comics that don't make money. But while Chan personally leads a quiet, almost invisible existence, his career is shot through with the great drama of history.

He lives through the epic transformation of his tiny island home from a Third World outpost of the British Empire to a sleek country often called the Switzerland of Asia, clean, orderly and so prosperous that its per capita GDP is one and a half times our own. Over the years, Chan experiences the Japanese invasion of World War II, Singapore's messy struggle for independence and the eventual emergence of a seemingly all-powerful ruling party. He watches this skillfully run if sometimes repressive state become a safe haven where billionaires move to stash their cash.

Now, Liew doesn't present this transformation so baldly. We watch it happen by reading the comics that Chan supposedly creates about these events. Of course, Liew himself creates them all, both naive and sophisticated, with dazzling virtuosity. Man, can this guy draw. Giving us a grand tour of comic book history, he works in styles that reference everything from Britain's ""The Beano"" and Japanese manga to Mad Magazine, ""Pogo,"" ""Spiderman,"" even Scrooge McDuck. Every page hums with visual invention, including those pages in which Liew himself turns up, a bespectacled little dude, to comment on the action.

Although ""The Art Charlie Chan Hock Chye"" is probably the greatest work of art ever produced in Singapore, the book was controversial there. It's not a country big on dissent, and Liew points out the cracks in the official myths erected by the party that's ruled for the last half-century. Yet at the same time, he hasn't written a subversive tract or poisoned pen letter.

Even as he regrets the country's missed opportunities, the book is filled with affection, even love. It's a Valentine to cartooning, to old buildings and street food, to heroes written out of official history, to ordinary people trying to make a better life. Most moving and most universal is Liew's portrait of the artist as a young, middle-aged and old man. By today's standards, Chan would be considered a failure. His work doesn't sell. His apartment is modest. And as the country around him grows richer and glossier, he lives in obscurity, all alone, creating comics about a success-mad culture that ignores him.

Near the end, the aging Chan jets to San Diego to attend Comic-Con in hopes of finding kindred spirits and maybe landing some work. The trip doesn't pan out, yet he doesn't let this disappointment stop him. Back home, surrounded by his pens and ink bottle, he keeps doing what he's always done - pursuing his art in the face of a world that doesn't seem to want it. You see, Chan would rather remain marginal forever than give up doing what he cares about most. And Liew makes it heartbreakingly clear that such devotion is one of the highest forms of grace.

We speak and write well most of the time.

There are, however, words and phrases that trip us up. Listeners, readers and our colleagues cringe at the mistakes.

This is going to be a living post. Were starting with some of the common mistakes. There are some links to where you can get help on the proper usages. Well add to the list as suggestions  perhaps we should say complaints  come in. The hope is that if the problem cases are identified, theyll become less common as times goes on.

 Advance planning: One of many pleonasms we should avoid.

 Anniversary: It is redundant to say one-year or five-year or 10-year ... anniversary.



 Begs the question: If you think that means raises the question, you will incur the wrath of dozens or more audience members.

 But: Its a little word we use far too often and in ways we shouldnt.

-- Countless: Do you really mean there are too many to count? Or that theres an indefinitely large number? Should you be saying hundreds or thousands?



 Data: At NPR, we use plural verbs and pronouns when referring to data  unless, that is, were confident were using the word as a collective noun. Tip: If you can substitute the word information, thats a sign youre using data as a collective noun. If the word numbers is the proper substitute, than you need plural verbs and pronouns.

 Farther and further: Use farther when discussing distances. Further is for issues involving matters of degree.

 Fewer or less? Do you choose your supermarket based on what the sign says over the express aisle? Some people do. Fewer is the word to use when things can be counted. Less is to be used when when youre talking about mass quantities.

 Interpreters and translators: An interpreter turns spoken words into another language. A translator works with written words.

 Lay and lie: Stop and check yourself before choosing between these words. Go here or here. At the very least, remember this: You lay down a book; you lie down to rest.

 Lecterns and podiums: You stand on a podium. You put your notes on a lectern, which you sit or stand behind.



 Marine, sailor, soldier: A Marine is not a soldier or a sailor. A sailor is not a Marine or a soldier. A soldier is not a sailor or a Marine. Be careful when referring to them.

 Media: NPR treats media as a plural.

 Percent and percentage point: When comparing changes in two percentages, the difference is expressed in percentage points. For example, if 36% of Little Valley Central Schools class of 76 show up at next years reunion, that will be an increase of 5 percentage points from the 31% turnout 10 years ago. Attendance, though, will go up 15%. Thats because the 15 who come next year would mark a 15% increase from the 13 who attended in 06.

 Reticent and reluctant: They do not mean the same thing. Websters defines reticent as habitually silent or uncommunicative; disinclined to speak readily; reserved; taciturn and having a restrained, quiet or understated quality.



 Shrink, shrank and shrunk; sink, sank and sunk: William Safire weighed in on these words back in 1995. Tip: The movie should have been called Honey, I Shrank the Kids.

 Vast majority: The best advice is to just not say it. Youll probably be wrong. Use facts instead.

But it was still heard 202 times in the past year. The odds are a bit better than 50-50 that it will be said in the next 24 hours.

Thats a problem.

After all, since we cant seem to agree on what the words mean or when they should be put together, it seems reasonable to conclude that listeners arent sure either. Whats more, attaching the word vast to majority is a judgment call. Whos saying its a vast majority? Whats the proof? Maybe its just a significant majority. Or a sizeable one. Or just a majority.

When possible, the best course is to use facts rather than just the vast majority label. Establish, for example, that

92 percent of those surveyed agreed and then, perhaps, talk about what such a vast majority means.

This brings to mind other guidance about:

 Avoiding cliches.

 Labels.

 Killing adjectives.

 Precision writing and editing.

 Words that get abused.

Note: My thanks to listener/reader Anne Sovik for suggesting we look into vast majority.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. Master percussionist Roman Diaz has releases his debut album as a leader called ""L'o Da Fun Bata."" Diaz arrived in New York from Havana, Cuba in 1999 and has since become a mainstay in the avant-garde jazz and Afro-Cuban music communities. Milo says this new album is the best presentation he's ever heard of musical ceremonies honoring deities transplanted from Nigeria to Cuba.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ELEGUA"")

ROMAN DIAZ: (Singing in foreign language).

MILO MILES, BYLINE: It's easy to forget when oceans of music are available for streaming at any time but certain powerful styles are tough to make effective as straight recordings. Muslim Sufi music, for instance, can be mildly engrossing as pure sound but only clicks when it's experienced along with the whirling, hypnotic dancers. For me, an even more confounding example are musical ceremonies attached to the Afro-Cuban religious practice known as Santeria or Lucumi or Osha, originally transported from the Aruba people of Nigeria. Roman Diaz's version of the style, like all others, is purely voices and percussion.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""OGGUN"")

DIAZ: (Singing in foreign language).

MILES: Over the years, I've heard more than a few albums that featured or at least included Lucumi ceremonies. Now, what I call drum and chant records are intrinsically challenging to get across to an audience that cannot see the performance and does not speak the language. There seemed to be too much emphasis on simplicity and authenticity. These are works you could study but not enjoy. You felt like a tourist, not a captivated listener. This is not the case with Roman Diaz's ""L'o Da Fun Bata,"" which is a joy for those unfamiliar with the tradition. Diaz introduces most tracks by reciting brief oracle poetry in the Afrocubanismo style developed during the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s and '30s. The biggest surprise of the record is that these passages do not break up the flow but enhance the rhythmic texture.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""OBATALA"")

DIAZ: (Singing in foreign language).

MILES: It's tricky to pin down exactly why ""L'o Da Fun Bata"" excels at being both a spiritual statement and essential work of art. The tracks present nonstop variety, as though the personalities of the Osha deities are more vividly detailed than on other recordings. Perhaps the choir work is more frankly melodic, and it's certainly impeccably harmonized. I would single out the soaring Nina Rodriguez as my favorite voice. The most likely explanation is that ""L'o Da Fun Bata"" never feels like sequences of bata drums, choirs, solo sings, more bata drums, but a mesh of all the players. As Diaz himself puts it, we are molecules in one nucleus. We all work together as one. If you are the least interested in this venerable African, Cuban, American tradition, ""L'o Da Fun Bata"" is where to begin.

GROSS: Milo Miles reviewed the new album ""L'o Da Fun Bata"" led by percussionist Roman Diaz. Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, inside the East Bay Rats, an Oakland motorcycle club with a reputation for boozing and brawling. Our guest will be writer Alex Abramovich who wrote about the Rats after discovering that one of the members was the guy who bullied him years ago when they were kids. Abramovich has a new book called ""Bullies: A Friendship."" I hope you'll join us.

Did Myanmar hold its most free elections in decades?

No, as a listener told us, it held its freest elections in decades.

Todays question: When should we use more or most instead of -er or -est to form comparatives and superlatives?

To figure out the answer, it helps to count syllables.

Fowlers Modern English Usage says that adjectives of one or two syllables normally form their comparative and superlative forms by adding er and est. ... Adjectives of more than two syllables are normally preceded by more or most ...

The BBC puts it this way: It is clear that adjectives of one syllable normally end in -er and est in their comparative and superlative forms whilst the comparative and superlative of adjectives with three or more syllables are formed with more and most.

The Chicago Manual of Style agrees. It notes, however, that a few one-syllable adjectives  such as real, right, and wrong  can take only more and most. ... Eager, proper, and somber, unlike many two-syllable adjectives, also take only more and most. It sagely advises consulting a good dictionary. (NPR uses Websters New World College Dictionary, Fifth Edition.)

Finally, in 1925 my great uncle Frederick Memmott and fellow educator Nell Young, in the sixth grade edition of their textbooks Good English in Speaking and Writing, told students that nearly all our adjectives containing only one syllable are compared by adding the syllables -er and -est. Some of our adjectives containing two or more syllables are compared by adding -er and -est, but others require the use of the words more and most. All the adjectives containing more than two syllables require the use of more and most in comparing things.

There you go. If the adjective has one or two syllables, you almost always add er and est. When there are three or more syllables, more and most are almost certainly the words to choose. Check the dictionary if youre not sure.

Uncle Frederick died 32 years before I was born. I dont know this for sure, but I trust he would have thanked us for keeping these guidelines in mind.

i Todd Davidson/Illustration Works/Corbis Todd Davidson/Illustration Works/Corbis

As we launch into Thanksgiving week, consider this: Research shows that feeling grateful doesn't just make you feel good. It also helps  literally helps  the heart.

A positive mental attitude is good for your heart. It fends off depression, stress and anxiety, which can increase the risk of heart disease, says Paul Mills, a professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine. Mills specializes in disease processes and has been researching behavior and heart health for decades. He wondered if the very specific feeling of gratitude made a difference, too.

So he did a study. He recruited 186 men and women, average age 66, who already had some damage to their heart, either through years of sustained high blood pressure or as a result of heart attack or even an infection of the heart itself. They each filled out a standard questionnaire to rate how grateful they felt for the people, places or things in their lives.

It turned out the more grateful people were, the healthier they were. ""They had less depressed mood, slept better and had more energy,"" says Mills.

And when Mills did blood tests to measure inflammation, the body's natural response to injury, or plaque buildup in the arteries, he found lower levels among those who were grateful  an indication of better heart health.

So Mills did a small follow-up study to look even more closely at gratitude. He tested 40 patients for heart disease and noted biological indications of heart disease such as inflammation and heart rhythm. Then he asked half of the patients to keep a journal most days of the week, and write about two or three things they were grateful for. People wrote about everything, from appreciating children to being grateful for spouses, friends, pets, travel, jobs and even good food.

After two months, Mills retested all 40 patients and found health benefits for the patients who wrote in their journals. Inflammation levels were reduced, and heart rhythm improved. And when he compared their heart disease risk before and after journal writing, there was a decrease in risk after two months of writing in their journals. Those results have been submitted to a journal, but aren't yet published.

Mills isn't sure exactly how gratitude helps the heart, but he thinks it's because it reduces stress, a huge factor in heart disease.

""Taking the time to focus on what you are thankful for,"" he says, ""letting that sense of gratitude wash over you  this helps us manage and cope.""

And helps keep our hearts healthy.",[]

Alex Abramovich was in his 30s when he looked up a guy who had bullied him in grade school. In his new memoir, Abramovich writes about reconnecting with Trevor, now the head of a motorcycle club.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. You've probably had the experience of reconnecting with a childhood friend and being surprised at the direction your friend's life has taken and perhaps discovering that you each have different memories of that childhood friendship. Our guest, writer Alex Abramovich, was in his 30s when he looked up a guy who'd bullied him in grade school, and he found his old tormentor, Trevor, was still using his fists. He headed a motorcycle club in Oakland, called the East Bay Rats, which had a reputation for boozing and brawling. The Rats regularly held neighborhood fistfights at a boxing ring behind their clubhouse, events they promoted with sweatshirts that read, East Bay Fight Night, Support Consensual Bloodshed. Abramovich wrote a magazine piece about the East Bay Rats then moved to Oakland for four years, where he spent so much time with the club that members like to say that he'd embedded with them. His new memoir is about the biker subculture, the struggling city of Oakland and his reflections on the violence in the East Bay Rats' lives and his own. It's called ""Bullies: A Friendship."" He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies.

DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Alex Abramovich, welcome to FRESH AIR. Tell us about your memories of Trevor Latham as a child.

ALEX ABRAMOVICH: I remember Trevor as a large, menacing, angry boy, which is funny because when I went back and met him years later and saw photos of him, it turned out that he was a little boy - we were both pretty little kids - and he only had his growth spurt years after I'd initially met him. But I remembered him as just this malevolent force in my life.

DAVIES: When you were how old?

ABRAMOVICH: I would've been 7 years old, and this was in the fourth grade and my dad and I had just moved to a new town. I'd only moved in with my dad the previous year. My mom had died that year so I'd moved in with my father. And then my dad lost his job almost immediately so we moved from Massachusetts in with my grandma in Brooklyn, and then towards the end of that year, we moved to Long Island, which is where I met Trevor. And I was only in that school for two years, but in my memory he loomed as this sort of - the archetypal bully. He was the bully I remembered out of all the bullies I'd known.

DAVIES: So you were classmates. Would he, like, wait for you after school or - what kinds of - if you remember, what kinds of encounters were they?

ABRAMOVICH: Well, our memories are different. My memories diverge from Trevor's. My memory is of Trevor, you know, being the sort of kid that would meet you at the schoolhouse door and threaten to meet you back there at the end of the school day and threaten to beat me up, threaten to kill me. And the way I remember it, he did meet me at the schoolhouse door at the end of the day and he did beat me up, and I remember rolling around on the ground with him tussling, kicking, biting - a lot of fear.

DAVIES: And, if you remember, why was he bullying you? Do you recall having a sense of what motivated him?

ABRAMOVICH: At the time, I had no idea. At the time, I was just this confused, scared kid and here was this force of nature that I suddenly encountered and couldn't quite get around. So I was beyond thinking of motivations at that point. I was just - you know, I was just a mess.

DAVIES: So a lot of time goes by and you reconnect. How did that happen?

ABRAMOVICH: You know how people you met before the Internet existed, you sort of never think to Google them?

DAVIES: Right.

ABRAMOVICH: It was that sort of thing with Trevor. I remembered him and I remembered his name, but I'd never thought to Google him until one day I did. And a very short thing came up on the screen that said, I moved to California, became a bouncer and started a motorcycle club. So I knew at that point that we were - we would meet again. That was too good to pass up.

DAVIES: So you connect and you go out to Oakland. And when you saw him for the first time as an adult, what did he look like?

ABRAMOVICH: He looked like a whale walking upright. He's a massive guy, shaved head, goatee, Roman nose. Just big, big. All of those guys are big, all of the guys in his club. And he was surrounded by the guys in his club the first time I saw him, but even then he stood out. And he looked nothing at all like the boy I'd known, but somehow I knew him immediately. I recognized him, I knew exactly which one he was. And the first time I saw him, he had a - it was in a bar, and he was a bouncer at the bar and he had a guy backed up against the wall and was holding him by the scruff of his shirt so he looked extra menacing.

DAVIES: Did you connect right away? I mean, what - how did he react to your getting in touch?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor's club is the East Bay Rats, that's his motorcycle club, and they have a website - a very bare-bones, old-fashioned website, but Trevor's number is on it. It was a 510 number, and I dialed it, and he was at the bar when I called him. And I said, you don't know me but I used to know you in grade school. We used to know each other in grade school. And, without missing a beat, he said, Alex Abramovich? It was very strange. And we started emailing - texting, but mostly emailing. It was really before texting - late at night, and sort of comparing memories, which turned out to be very different, his and mine. So there was a basis for communication by the time I got out to Oakland, and we got along well. We sat at his bar and - he stopped bouncing - sat down at the bar, and we drank whiskey and then we were drunk. So that's how that first meeting went.

DAVIES: And you hadn't seen each other since the fourth grade, but you clearly remembered him. You'd spoken to your friends about him. So the bullying really left an impression on you. When you reconnected as adults, what was his memory of your relationship as kids?

ABRAMOVICH: Well, I remembered him in part, I think - in retrospect, it seems to me that I remembered him because Trevor Latham is such a strong, good name for a bully. The way he remembered it - it's interesting, in the specific details of what we did - our fights, our memories - pretty much aligned. He remembers fighting, he remembers fighting in the classroom, teachers breaking us up. He remembers us getting sent down to the principal's office. He remembered our fathers having to pick us up at school - much more specific memories than I had, actually. But, weirdly enough, he also remembers that I was bullying him as much as he was bullying me, and, moreover, he remembers that despite that we were good friends at the time. He remembers us playing chess, going to each other's houses. I don't remember any of this. Didn't then, don't now.

DAVIES: And with the light of all of the experience, what's your best guess as to who's right?

ABRAMOVICH: I think in way we're both right. You know, I was an angry, messed-up kid and I'm sure that there were times when I was the aggressor, especially if this was an ongoing, you know, broken relationship between us. But what's also interesting about it is that our - the specific details of our memories line up, but that makes me think that Trevor's a bully, whereas it leads him to think that because we were fighting all the time that meant we must've been friends.

DAVIES: Wow. So he saw - he saw somebody he fought with all the time as a friend.

ABRAMOVICH: Well, not only that, but he grew up to be friends with people he fought with all the time, professionally.

DAVIES: Right, which we're going to get to. But before that, tell me a little about your family and his family when you were kids.

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. Trevor comes from a very, very old family in Long Island, the Lathams, and if you go out to the very northernmost tip of Long Island to Orient, the town called Orient, you'll see the name everywhere on farm stands, hardware stores - it's Latham, Latham, Latham. So his family had been on Long Island forever, and they became very successful. They were lawyers and architects, and there was money. And Trevor's father grew up on an estate on the North Shore in these sort of Gatsby-esque surroundings, but by the time I knew Trevor, the money was sort of gone. His family had split up. His mother and sisters had moved to California so it was just Trevor and Trevor's dad - who was unemployed at the time - sort of stuck in that house.

DAVIES: And do you know what kind of relationship he had with his dad?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor describes his father as being a very angry individual. I think there was a lot of rage. There were holes in the sheetrock where his dad had punched through them. What Trevor told me when I met him was, my father didn't really hit me but the threat was always there, and the threat was more frightening than actually being hit because when anything is possible all the time, sort of all bets are off.

DAVIES: And what was your childhood like with your dad after your mom died?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, my family immigrated to America in 1976 so we didn't really know anyone in the country. And my parents split up about six months after we got here so my mom and I went to live in Pittsburgh and my dad went to live in New York. And he'd visit and I'd see him. We were close, but physically, we were removed by hundreds of miles. And then when my mom got too sick to take care of me, I stayed with a series of family friends. So by the time I went to live with my dad, there'd been a series of sort of dislocations for me, and I think I was already a pretty messed up and somewhat out-of-control kid and a lot for my father to handle. My father - who would've been younger than I am now, I think - all of a sudden is saddled with this damaged, you know, semi-feral child, which was what I was at that time, and I think it was overwhelming for him in some ways. I know I was a lot to handle. And then on top of that, they weren't the best economic times and we had no family in the country, we had no economic safety net. We didn't really know our neighbors so it was very isolating, and all the more isolating because we kept moving. I think by the time I started fourth grade, I had been to eight or nine schools - something like that. So it was hard at home. I think Trevor in some ways had it harder than me, but there were certainly points at which I could relate to his story when I met him.

DAVIES: Well, you go out to Oakland, you connect with Trevor, and he is the head of the East Bay Rats motorcycle club. There are lots of different kinds of motorcycle clubs, you know, some more benign than others. Give us your early impressions of the East Bay Rats.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah, I mean, I think most people picture, you know, ""Sons Of Anarchy,"" let's say, when they picture a motorcycle club, and there's a grain of truth to that depiction, although there's a lot that actual bikers would quibble with. The Rats sort of ride the line between presenting as a criminal organization, but they're not really criminals. They're more - they're miscreants and they're hooligans, but there are no real criminal enterprises. That said, there are a lot of them. There are about 35 at any given time. It's about the size of an Army platoon. They're big. They're not conflict-averse. And they're intimidating, they're in uniform. They're wearing motorcycle leathers, they're wearing armor, they're wearing helmets, they're wearing basically the best gear you could possibly wear in a street fight. And they know what they look like - they're very self-aware - so they're very good at gauging how intimidating they're being or presenting at any given moment.

DAVIES: Describe the clubhouse.

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. The clubhouse is an old barbershop on San Pablo Avenue, which was the oldest street in the East Bay, it used to be the Camino Real. And the clubhouse was - it was always sort of a clubhouse. It was a barbershop. It was an African-American barbershop. So it was always sort of a meeting place. In 2006, the first time I saw it, there was a speak-easy bar next door. That bar, I found out, used to be Huey Newton's speak-easy when he was on that stretch of San Pablo. So it was always this community center, that block, but that said, it had fallen on very tough times indeed. There were a lot of homeless people, there were a lot of recyclers pushing shopping carts, a lot of drugs. There was a lot of violence. So, you know, there'd be bloodstains on the sidewalk and - and the clubhouse itself was about the size of a barbershop with a backyard. And it was a concrete floor, sheetrock walls, boxing equipment wherever you looked. There was a bar that Trevor had installed stripper poles on and women would get up there during parties they threw. And, in the back, there was a barbecue pit and Trevor's old truck, and it was an old Ford Bronco that he'd painted flat black, and a boxing - well, the first time I saw it, there was no boxing ring. There were couches arranged in a square, and that's what served as a boxing ring. Later on, they got an actual boxing ring and put it in back there.

DAVIES: You said that these guys are not conflict averse, which is a nice way of saying they seem to love to mix it up. And there's a section that I'd like you to read here where you're talking about one of the club's members, a guy named John Firpo (ph), and his interaction with a stranger who had said the wrong thing. Do you want to read this for us?

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. (Reading) John Firpo had George Bellows' painting tattooed on his torso. Now I watched him punch the stranger who'd said the wrong thing. A single blow was all that it took to put the man on the concrete. This was a thing the Rats did, for the bored and unstable, for masochists or men who are eager to show off and prove themselves in some dumb way. There was no shame in getting beaten up by one of the Rats. Anyone could walk into the clubhouse, tell one of them off. They'd kick your [expletive] immediately without getting mad or taking things personally.

They were not conflict averse. They wouldn't even gang up on you necessarily. Beat downs were like a community service the Rats provided. The stranger didn't take his personally. He got back on his feet and apologized, told Firpo that his mom had just died, that he'd been messed up, at his wits end and had not meant to say anything all. Now that he had, he was sorry. I'm sorry about your mother, said Firpo as he guided the man out of the clubhouse.

DAVIES: (Laughter) That's a - this is a remarkable scene, and it's almost as if these guys use violence the way others use language, isn't it?

ABRAMOVICH: That's a beautiful way of putting it. Yeah, it's a form of communication and it's also a form of exchanging affections.

DAVIES: Alex Abramovich is our guest. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, our guest is writer Alex Abramovich. His new book, ""Bullies: A Friendship,"" is about a friendship that he renewed with a kid he'd known from his youth who turns out to have founded a motorcycle club in Oakland. Alex Abramovich spent a lot of time there.

Now, the club, as we read your book, seems less about riding bikes than about fighting. And Trevor organized fight nights at which the public would be invited and he would have people in the boxing ring out back. Initially you say it was just a bunch of couches arranged in a square, but eventually there was a boxing ring. Do you want to describe one of these events for us?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, they sound different than they are to attend. They're fun in real life, although they're bloody and violent. And sometimes they were impromptu. Sometimes people - fights would just break out. But sometimes they were very organized and they would have themes. There was, in fact, the Jews versus Gentiles fight night, which would be a two-man versus two-man fight, so a four-man fight. And it would be over bragging rights for who could name the next holiday party. Would it be a Christmas party or would it be a Hanukkah party. And it was billed as the battle of the sects.

DAVIES: The battle of the sects, OK, S-E-C-T, OK.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. So fliers went out all over town. And there was a series of undercards, so a lot of other people fought before the Jews and the Gentiles got into the ring. And oddly enough, I didn't know that there were too many Jewish bikers out there. I'd never really run into them in New York, but there are a couple. In the ring, the violence was very contained. And the further away you went from the ring, the more violent things got. And sort of once you slipped into the shadows, you'd start seeing really nasty things happening. So at the time that the Jews and the Gentiles are fighting in the ring in the back, out front on San Pablo Avenue some recyclers are maybe getting beaten up for instance.

DAVIES: Recyclers - these are, like, guys who pick up cans to get, you know, food for their habits or whatever, right?

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. I mean, there's a recycling center that's a few blocks from the clubhouse. And it's a source of constant tension in the neighborhood because not only are the recyclers with their shopping carts always clogging up San Pablo Avenue, but there are problems having to do with people's houses getting broken into, tools getting stolen, pipes getting stolen. In fact, the East Bay Rats' clubhouse was broken into while I was there and Trevor's plumbing was stolen.

And then there are also issues having to do with public urination, public defecation, prostitution, drug dealing. And remarkably enough, some of the recyclers seem to think that if they'd break their bags full of bottles - they're sold by weight. So they think that if they break their bags full of bottles they'll weigh more because broken glass weighs more than intact bottles. So there's this constant soundtrack of breaking glass.

DAVIES: You describe an incident that you witnessed between some members of the motorcycle club, the East Bay Rats, and a recycler. You want to tell us about that?

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. So the recyclers are kind of a constant presence and when the Rats drink beer, which they do all the time and in fact there's a soda machine that sells dollar beers in the clubhouse, they'll just toss the empties outside and the empties will be gone within 30 seconds or a minute. And that's their form of recycling.

So at the night of one of the fight nights, there was a recycler who kept hovering right around the door. And usually what'll happen at a fight night or an East Bay Rats party is all of the Rats and people belonging to other clubs will ride up to the clubhouse and park their bikes in a neat line down the length of the block. So it makes for quite a visual. And on one night, I saw there was a recycler who kept darting in in between their legs right outside the clubhouse front door to get the cans, basically, to get empty beer cans.

And, you know, there are often people hanging around the Rats who want to impress them, who want to be prospects for the club. And someone like that was around that evening. And he got up at one point, got up off the motorcycle he was sitting on, walked over to the recycler and shoved him hard into the line of bikes. And, you know, I was holding my breath, and for a minute I thought it was going to be OK, but it wasn't OK. Another Rat came up and touching the bike was enough it turned out. Everyone was drunk and a Rat went up and he knocked the man down to the ground. And then a couple of other Rats came out and they knocked the man to the ground. And San Pablo is a wide avenue. It's four lanes with a big median strip. And the man crawled over - the recycler crawled over the median strip and - onto the oncoming traffic lane. And I turned and I saw one of the Rats flip the visor on his helmet down and he was on his motorcycle and he rode it around the median strip. And he rode it up to the recycler who was lying on the ground at this point bleeding. And he rolled his bike back and forth sort of nudging the recycler a few times with the front tire. And then he gunned it and he rode over the recycler's torso, which was very horrible to watch and horrible to think about and horrible also to think that I could've done something to stop it in real time. And I didn't realize that in real time and didn't do anything to stop it, so not a proud moment for me.

DAVIES: And the recycler survived, got up and walked away?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I turned around and I thought I was going to throw up when I saw them ride over the recycler's body. And when I turned back around, the recycler was gone. I was expecting him to be lying on the cement with broken bones, but he had scampered away. The next time I saw Trevor, Trevor said, you'd be surprised. Crack heads are surprisingly resilient, and I said I wish I could've done something to stop it, and Trevor said you could've. All it takes is someone saying stop.

GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Alex Abramovich about his new book, ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll hear more of the interview after a break. And we'll remember The Beatles' record producer George Martin, who died yesterday at age 90. We'll listen back to an interview I recorded with him about helping shape their early sound and about producing ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Alex Abramovich about his new memoir, ""Bullies: A Friendship."" It's about reconnecting with a guy who'd bullied him when they were kids. When they reconnected, that guy, Trevor, was the head of a motorcycle club in East Oakland called the East Bay Rats, which was known for their bruising and brawling. The book is in part about that subculture.

DAVIES: What was the East Bay Rats' attitude towards racial diversity? I mean, there's - it's a city with a history of some racial issues certainly.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. I didn't know this before I started writing the book, but it turns out that many motorcycle clubs are formed along racial lines. I mean, they form along all sorts of lines. They form along - the police themselves in Oakland have a motorcycle club. In fact, there are two motorcycle clubs associated with the police out there. But well-known national clubs tend to break down along racial lines, and the Rats do not. There are African-American members. There are Jewish members, as I mentioned. There are Mexican-American members. So for the Rats, that's never really been an issue. It's very inclusive in that way. And it's also inclusive sexually I would say. Gays and lesbians are always welcome in the clubhouse. They're welcome in the - at fight nights. It's an interesting question what would happen if an openly gay man were to try to join the Rats. I'm not sure how that would fly. But in terms of people they hang out with, it's absolutely copacetic. So in that sense, the Rats are not - I would say that the Rats are more evolved in certain ways than our present political moment.

DAVIES: And what about their attitude towards women? You know, you hear of motorcycle clubs having women with - wearing things saying that they're the club's property.

ABRAMOVICH: I mean, they're not models of enlightened 21st-century, you know, men. And the gender roles are - tend to be a little old-fashioned maybe by standards employed elsewhere in the Bay Area. There are a couple of young women who hung out with the Rats. Bea (ph) and an Amber (ph) are their names, and they made themselves patches that read East Bay Cats (ph). So they were sort of like the girls auxiliary. But that's not quite the same as saying property of. On the other hand, it's certainly true - and I saw this time and again - that the Rats are both incredibly attractive for and aware of their own attractiveness to certain kinds of women in Oakland. And they take full advantage of that. And the full advantage of that might involve orgies in the back of the bar or the clubhouse. I don't think they really do this anymore. You know, they've aged out of it and they're family men now, but there was a lot of stuff going on in relation to girls.

DAVIES: Were there any stories of rape or sexual abuse of women in the club?

ABRAMOVICH: No. I never heard anything remotely about a rape and I think that I would've. I spent four years with those guys and I spent a lot of that time with people who didn't like those guys, so I would've heard about it. I heard a lot of messed up sexual stories, but nothing that wasn't consensual.

The one thing that happened while I was out there was that at one of the fight nights there was a man that assaulted a young woman. And they were making out and he started choking her and then she was on the ground and then she ran into the clubhouse covered in blood. And she said that this guy had tried to rape her and the Rats came down immediately like avenging angels, and they beat that guy to within an inch of his life. And Trevor said that as I was hitting him I was really sad because I really like this guy but here he was, you know, but then he also felt sad that he didn't break the guy's legs with a shovel.

DAVIES: Because there was a code of some kind.

ABRAMOVICH: The code is - there are rules. They're written down. I wasn't allowed to see them. Prospects aren't even allowed to see them. You're only allowed to see them once you patch in as a member. But I know what some of the rules are, and there are rules governing the treatment of women and the word respect comes up very often. So not only do you not disrespect women when they're around you but you especially respect each other's girlfriends. You have to ask permission before you date someone's ex-girlfriend. As you would imagine, this leads to a certain amount of friction.

DAVIES: You spent some time with the motorcycle club the East Bay Rats when you were writing a magazine article. Then you went back to New York and eventually came back to Oakland with your girlfriend and lived there for quite a while. So you had a lot of experience and spent a lot of time with the guys in the club. What did they think of you?

ABRAMOVICH: They didn't know what to make of me. The first time I met them when I was writing the magazine article, Trevor had told everyone that I was his bully, so they couldn't wait to see the guy who had bullied the president of their motorcycle club. And they were surprised when this, you know, 5-foot-8 guy with glasses stepped out of his rental car.

DAVIES: (Laughter).

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor does not wear glasses and he's well over 6 feet tall. And they did what they would do to anyone that they liked initially - they hazed me. And they put me on a motorcycle on my first full day in Oakland, my first morning in Oakland. And they put me on a motorcycle that I was guaranteed to crash, which I did crash. And I crashed it right away and I crashed it badly. I think they expected a smaller crash, but I crashed it in style. And I broke my hand, but weirdly enough, my hand - I don't know if it was the adrenaline or just the way the nerves are arranged, but for whatever reason my hand didn't hurt until I got back to New York. So instead of going to the hospital, I wrapped it up in boxing tape and I stayed out there for a week, and I kept reporting.

So in a sense we sort of got the hazing out of the way very early and I think that I ended up presenting or appearing as a much braver person than I actually am. If my hand had actually been hurting I would've gone to the hospital. But then the magazine article came out six or seven months later and the Rats liked that very much. They're not criminals, so they don't make any money off the club, so the coin for them is publicity. And they're savvy when it comes to publicity, and this was publicity on a grand national scale, so they liked that a lot.

So the magazine article came out, and it brought them a fair amount of welcome attention, including sexual attention, and they like that. So there was a certain amount of goodwill, I would say, built in by the time I arrived back at the club. But it's a club with, you know, as I said, 35 members and some of them like the cameras and some of them don't like the cameras. And that's a dynamic in and of itself, just having a camera changes what's happening at the clubhouse. So there were Rats that didn't like me at all and probably still don't like me and they pretty much stayed away from me. John Firpo, who we mentioned already, took a very active dislike to me. And John Firpo is a very large and very intimidating, scary dude. And that was unpleasant. John and I got along fine now, but...

DAVIES: Well, I was going to - did you feel afraid ever? I mean, you were there for some long nights with a lot of drinking and I'm sure they got really rowdy. Did you feel afraid?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I didn't feel afraid because I was in - I was working. I was there to take notes. I was drinking sometimes, but I was still working. And there was a sort of circle of safety involved when you were with Trevor. So as long as I stayed within that circle of safety, I felt OK. Now, there were things that happened at the periphery that were not OK and that were scary and frightening and genuinely I would say lightweight dangerous.

DAVIES: Alex Abramovich is our guest. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, we're speaking with writer Alex Abramovich. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" It's about him reconnecting with a kid he'd known from his youth who turns out to have founded a motorcycle club in Oakland. Alex Abramovich spent a lot of time there.

You know, it's interesting. There are places in the book where you have long extended stories quoted verbatim from some of the bikers, particularly Trevor. I assume you carried a tape recorder a lot of the time. And he certainly sounds very well spoken. You do say you wondered at points if he was a sociopath. What made you wonder that?

ABRAMOVICH: Things he did. To give two very brief examples - one was a story that he told me. I picked him up one day. We were going somewhere and he said, you know, it's funny. A crackhead was peeing on my door last night and I opened up the door and there he was. And I took a shovel and, you know, I broke the guy's arm. I could tell I'd broken his arm from the way it was flopping around. But then, you know, I walked inside and I turned on the PlayStation and I was playing ""Star Wars Battlefront"" and I got the highest score I've ever gotten. I thought that was a strange story.

DAVIES: Trevor's life did change over time, right? What's he up to now?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor's got a very heteronormative life now. I mean, it was pretty heteronormative before, but now it's a pretty just normative let's say. He lives in Emeryville now, which is a small town next to Oakland. He moved out of Oakland because everyone is getting priced out of Oakland these days, or as Trevor put it, Oakland's getting nicer and that's great, but if it gets too much nicer, we'll all have to leave. So he left.

He got a job doing outdoor work with the city of Albany, which is another small town nearby that has really good schools that he can send his kids to. And Trevor has two little boys now. He got married. He stopped being a bouncer. At some point, he bought himself a purple Harley-Davidson. These guys all ride very fast Japanese sports bikes that they customize and turn into Rat bikes - what they call them. But Trevor bought this, you know, giant thing out of ""Purple Rain"" with a CD player, which he's since gotten rid of. Even that was too much for him. But he's got a - Trevor's very wily and he's sort of set himself up with the life that he wants and on the surface at least it looks pretty much like, you know, this American life.

DAVIES: And is there less violence in his life?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I never saw Trevor - Trevor got into fights while I was there at the bar, but I never saw Trevor inside the ring. I never actually saw him box. He and I sparred together. He taught me how to box, but I never saw him that directly involved in violence. Now he's not a bouncer at the club anymore, so that takes that whole part out of the equation. They still have fight nights, and the club's actually thriving now. It was in a bit of a lull when I was out there.

So on the one hand, he's surrounded by violence, but on the other hand, you know, he's also a father now. And he told me a funny story just this week actually. They were having a fight night and his boy Mason (ph) was there. And Mason's about 2-and-a-half, maybe going on 3 now. And Mason had seen lots of boxing and ultimate fighting on TV and he'd seen people spar at the clubhouse, but he'd never seen an actual fight. And now people are fighting in the boxing ring. And these were people that he knows and loves and cares about and they're hurting each other and they're getting hurt. And Trevor looked down at Mason and he thought, oh, my God, am I one of those parents? What am I exposing my kid to? And before he could do anything, Mesa looked up at his mom and handed her his dinosaurs and ran into the clubhouse. And Trevor - you know, Trevor went after him and he was expecting to find Mason in the corner crying, but instead Trevor said Mason was in there hitting the heavy bag.

DAVIES: Wow (laughter). How well do you feel that you know him? I mean, are you good friends now? Do you feel like you understand him?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, he's my oldest friend, I think. I've known him for 30 - is that right - 35 years now and I'm only 43. And I'm his oldest friend. So in a sense there's a very deep connection and whenever we don't see each other for a while, we pick up the thread very quickly. As far as understanding him, I think my understanding of him is contained in that I can sort of walk around him and describe him. And I think I did a pretty good job of it in the book of describing how he comes across, how his very, very unusual mind works. But in terms of really, really going in there and untangling the motivations, yeah, you know, the short answer is I do think I get it and I think I described it. He functions under tremendous internal pressures and he has absorbed a great deal of poison and he's gotten better and better at with every passing year at lancing that poison and finding productive ways to - or at least non-self-destructive ways to let seep back out into the world.

DAVIES: Well, Alex Abramovich, thanks so much for speaking with us.

ABRAMOVICH: Thanks so much, Dave. It was a pleasure.

GROSS: Alex Abramovich is the author of the new memoir ""Bullies: A Friendship."" He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies, who is also WHYY's senior reporter. Coming up, we remember George Martin who produced 13 albums by The Beatles. He died yesterday. We'll listen back to my interview with him about working with The Beatles. This is FRESH AIR.

Alex Abramovich was in his 30s when he looked up a guy who had bullied him in grade school. In his new memoir, Abramovich writes about reconnecting with Trevor, now the head of a motorcycle club.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. You've probably had the experience of reconnecting with a childhood friend and being surprised at the direction your friend's life has taken and perhaps discovering that you each have different memories of that childhood friendship. Our guest, writer Alex Abramovich, was in his 30s when he looked up a guy who'd bullied him in grade school, and he found his old tormentor, Trevor, was still using his fists. He headed a motorcycle club in Oakland, called the East Bay Rats, which had a reputation for boozing and brawling. The Rats regularly held neighborhood fistfights at a boxing ring behind their clubhouse, events they promoted with sweatshirts that read, East Bay Fight Night, Support Consensual Bloodshed. Abramovich wrote a magazine piece about the East Bay Rats then moved to Oakland for four years, where he spent so much time with the club that members like to say that he'd embedded with them. His new memoir is about the biker subculture, the struggling city of Oakland and his reflections on the violence in the East Bay Rats' lives and his own. It's called ""Bullies: A Friendship."" He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies.

DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Alex Abramovich, welcome to FRESH AIR. Tell us about your memories of Trevor Latham as a child.

ALEX ABRAMOVICH: I remember Trevor as a large, menacing, angry boy, which is funny because when I went back and met him years later and saw photos of him, it turned out that he was a little boy - we were both pretty little kids - and he only had his growth spurt years after I'd initially met him. But I remembered him as just this malevolent force in my life.

DAVIES: When you were how old?

ABRAMOVICH: I would've been 7 years old, and this was in the fourth grade and my dad and I had just moved to a new town. I'd only moved in with my dad the previous year. My mom had died that year so I'd moved in with my father. And then my dad lost his job almost immediately so we moved from Massachusetts in with my grandma in Brooklyn, and then towards the end of that year, we moved to Long Island, which is where I met Trevor. And I was only in that school for two years, but in my memory he loomed as this sort of - the archetypal bully. He was the bully I remembered out of all the bullies I'd known.

DAVIES: So you were classmates. Would he, like, wait for you after school or - what kinds of - if you remember, what kinds of encounters were they?

ABRAMOVICH: Well, our memories are different. My memories diverge from Trevor's. My memory is of Trevor, you know, being the sort of kid that would meet you at the schoolhouse door and threaten to meet you back there at the end of the school day and threaten to beat me up, threaten to kill me. And the way I remember it, he did meet me at the schoolhouse door at the end of the day and he did beat me up, and I remember rolling around on the ground with him tussling, kicking, biting - a lot of fear.

DAVIES: And, if you remember, why was he bullying you? Do you recall having a sense of what motivated him?

ABRAMOVICH: At the time, I had no idea. At the time, I was just this confused, scared kid and here was this force of nature that I suddenly encountered and couldn't quite get around. So I was beyond thinking of motivations at that point. I was just - you know, I was just a mess.

DAVIES: So a lot of time goes by and you reconnect. How did that happen?

ABRAMOVICH: You know how people you met before the Internet existed, you sort of never think to Google them?

DAVIES: Right.

ABRAMOVICH: It was that sort of thing with Trevor. I remembered him and I remembered his name, but I'd never thought to Google him until one day I did. And a very short thing came up on the screen that said, I moved to California, became a bouncer and started a motorcycle club. So I knew at that point that we were - we would meet again. That was too good to pass up.

DAVIES: So you connect and you go out to Oakland. And when you saw him for the first time as an adult, what did he look like?

ABRAMOVICH: He looked like a whale walking upright. He's a massive guy, shaved head, goatee, Roman nose. Just big, big. All of those guys are big, all of the guys in his club. And he was surrounded by the guys in his club the first time I saw him, but even then he stood out. And he looked nothing at all like the boy I'd known, but somehow I knew him immediately. I recognized him, I knew exactly which one he was. And the first time I saw him, he had a - it was in a bar, and he was a bouncer at the bar and he had a guy backed up against the wall and was holding him by the scruff of his shirt so he looked extra menacing.

DAVIES: Did you connect right away? I mean, what - how did he react to your getting in touch?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor's club is the East Bay Rats, that's his motorcycle club, and they have a website - a very bare-bones, old-fashioned website, but Trevor's number is on it. It was a 510 number, and I dialed it, and he was at the bar when I called him. And I said, you don't know me but I used to know you in grade school. We used to know each other in grade school. And, without missing a beat, he said, Alex Abramovich? It was very strange. And we started emailing - texting, but mostly emailing. It was really before texting - late at night, and sort of comparing memories, which turned out to be very different, his and mine. So there was a basis for communication by the time I got out to Oakland, and we got along well. We sat at his bar and - he stopped bouncing - sat down at the bar, and we drank whiskey and then we were drunk. So that's how that first meeting went.

DAVIES: And you hadn't seen each other since the fourth grade, but you clearly remembered him. You'd spoken to your friends about him. So the bullying really left an impression on you. When you reconnected as adults, what was his memory of your relationship as kids?

ABRAMOVICH: Well, I remembered him in part, I think - in retrospect, it seems to me that I remembered him because Trevor Latham is such a strong, good name for a bully. The way he remembered it - it's interesting, in the specific details of what we did - our fights, our memories - pretty much aligned. He remembers fighting, he remembers fighting in the classroom, teachers breaking us up. He remembers us getting sent down to the principal's office. He remembered our fathers having to pick us up at school - much more specific memories than I had, actually. But, weirdly enough, he also remembers that I was bullying him as much as he was bullying me, and, moreover, he remembers that despite that we were good friends at the time. He remembers us playing chess, going to each other's houses. I don't remember any of this. Didn't then, don't now.

DAVIES: And with the light of all of the experience, what's your best guess as to who's right?

ABRAMOVICH: I think in way we're both right. You know, I was an angry, messed-up kid and I'm sure that there were times when I was the aggressor, especially if this was an ongoing, you know, broken relationship between us. But what's also interesting about it is that our - the specific details of our memories line up, but that makes me think that Trevor's a bully, whereas it leads him to think that because we were fighting all the time that meant we must've been friends.

DAVIES: Wow. So he saw - he saw somebody he fought with all the time as a friend.

ABRAMOVICH: Well, not only that, but he grew up to be friends with people he fought with all the time, professionally.

DAVIES: Right, which we're going to get to. But before that, tell me a little about your family and his family when you were kids.

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. Trevor comes from a very, very old family in Long Island, the Lathams, and if you go out to the very northernmost tip of Long Island to Orient, the town called Orient, you'll see the name everywhere on farm stands, hardware stores - it's Latham, Latham, Latham. So his family had been on Long Island forever, and they became very successful. They were lawyers and architects, and there was money. And Trevor's father grew up on an estate on the North Shore in these sort of Gatsby-esque surroundings, but by the time I knew Trevor, the money was sort of gone. His family had split up. His mother and sisters had moved to California so it was just Trevor and Trevor's dad - who was unemployed at the time - sort of stuck in that house.

DAVIES: And do you know what kind of relationship he had with his dad?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor describes his father as being a very angry individual. I think there was a lot of rage. There were holes in the sheetrock where his dad had punched through them. What Trevor told me when I met him was, my father didn't really hit me but the threat was always there, and the threat was more frightening than actually being hit because when anything is possible all the time, sort of all bets are off.

DAVIES: And what was your childhood like with your dad after your mom died?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, my family immigrated to America in 1976 so we didn't really know anyone in the country. And my parents split up about six months after we got here so my mom and I went to live in Pittsburgh and my dad went to live in New York. And he'd visit and I'd see him. We were close, but physically, we were removed by hundreds of miles. And then when my mom got too sick to take care of me, I stayed with a series of family friends. So by the time I went to live with my dad, there'd been a series of sort of dislocations for me, and I think I was already a pretty messed up and somewhat out-of-control kid and a lot for my father to handle. My father - who would've been younger than I am now, I think - all of a sudden is saddled with this damaged, you know, semi-feral child, which was what I was at that time, and I think it was overwhelming for him in some ways. I know I was a lot to handle. And then on top of that, they weren't the best economic times and we had no family in the country, we had no economic safety net. We didn't really know our neighbors so it was very isolating, and all the more isolating because we kept moving. I think by the time I started fourth grade, I had been to eight or nine schools - something like that. So it was hard at home. I think Trevor in some ways had it harder than me, but there were certainly points at which I could relate to his story when I met him.

DAVIES: Well, you go out to Oakland, you connect with Trevor, and he is the head of the East Bay Rats motorcycle club. There are lots of different kinds of motorcycle clubs, you know, some more benign than others. Give us your early impressions of the East Bay Rats.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah, I mean, I think most people picture, you know, ""Sons Of Anarchy,"" let's say, when they picture a motorcycle club, and there's a grain of truth to that depiction, although there's a lot that actual bikers would quibble with. The Rats sort of ride the line between presenting as a criminal organization, but they're not really criminals. They're more - they're miscreants and they're hooligans, but there are no real criminal enterprises. That said, there are a lot of them. There are about 35 at any given time. It's about the size of an Army platoon. They're big. They're not conflict-averse. And they're intimidating, they're in uniform. They're wearing motorcycle leathers, they're wearing armor, they're wearing helmets, they're wearing basically the best gear you could possibly wear in a street fight. And they know what they look like - they're very self-aware - so they're very good at gauging how intimidating they're being or presenting at any given moment.

DAVIES: Describe the clubhouse.

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. The clubhouse is an old barbershop on San Pablo Avenue, which was the oldest street in the East Bay, it used to be the Camino Real. And the clubhouse was - it was always sort of a clubhouse. It was a barbershop. It was an African-American barbershop. So it was always sort of a meeting place. In 2006, the first time I saw it, there was a speak-easy bar next door. That bar, I found out, used to be Huey Newton's speak-easy when he was on that stretch of San Pablo. So it was always this community center, that block, but that said, it had fallen on very tough times indeed. There were a lot of homeless people, there were a lot of recyclers pushing shopping carts, a lot of drugs. There was a lot of violence. So, you know, there'd be bloodstains on the sidewalk and - and the clubhouse itself was about the size of a barbershop with a backyard. And it was a concrete floor, sheetrock walls, boxing equipment wherever you looked. There was a bar that Trevor had installed stripper poles on and women would get up there during parties they threw. And, in the back, there was a barbecue pit and Trevor's old truck, and it was an old Ford Bronco that he'd painted flat black, and a boxing - well, the first time I saw it, there was no boxing ring. There were couches arranged in a square, and that's what served as a boxing ring. Later on, they got an actual boxing ring and put it in back there.

DAVIES: You said that these guys are not conflict averse, which is a nice way of saying they seem to love to mix it up. And there's a section that I'd like you to read here where you're talking about one of the club's members, a guy named John Firpo (ph), and his interaction with a stranger who had said the wrong thing. Do you want to read this for us?

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. (Reading) John Firpo had George Bellows' painting tattooed on his torso. Now I watched him punch the stranger who'd said the wrong thing. A single blow was all that it took to put the man on the concrete. This was a thing the Rats did, for the bored and unstable, for masochists or men who are eager to show off and prove themselves in some dumb way. There was no shame in getting beaten up by one of the Rats. Anyone could walk into the clubhouse, tell one of them off. They'd kick your [expletive] immediately without getting mad or taking things personally.

They were not conflict averse. They wouldn't even gang up on you necessarily. Beat downs were like a community service the Rats provided. The stranger didn't take his personally. He got back on his feet and apologized, told Firpo that his mom had just died, that he'd been messed up, at his wits end and had not meant to say anything all. Now that he had, he was sorry. I'm sorry about your mother, said Firpo as he guided the man out of the clubhouse.

DAVIES: (Laughter) That's a - this is a remarkable scene, and it's almost as if these guys use violence the way others use language, isn't it?

ABRAMOVICH: That's a beautiful way of putting it. Yeah, it's a form of communication and it's also a form of exchanging affections.

DAVIES: Alex Abramovich is our guest. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, our guest is writer Alex Abramovich. His new book, ""Bullies: A Friendship,"" is about a friendship that he renewed with a kid he'd known from his youth who turns out to have founded a motorcycle club in Oakland. Alex Abramovich spent a lot of time there.

Now, the club, as we read your book, seems less about riding bikes than about fighting. And Trevor organized fight nights at which the public would be invited and he would have people in the boxing ring out back. Initially you say it was just a bunch of couches arranged in a square, but eventually there was a boxing ring. Do you want to describe one of these events for us?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, they sound different than they are to attend. They're fun in real life, although they're bloody and violent. And sometimes they were impromptu. Sometimes people - fights would just break out. But sometimes they were very organized and they would have themes. There was, in fact, the Jews versus Gentiles fight night, which would be a two-man versus two-man fight, so a four-man fight. And it would be over bragging rights for who could name the next holiday party. Would it be a Christmas party or would it be a Hanukkah party. And it was billed as the battle of the sects.

DAVIES: The battle of the sects, OK, S-E-C-T, OK.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. So fliers went out all over town. And there was a series of undercards, so a lot of other people fought before the Jews and the Gentiles got into the ring. And oddly enough, I didn't know that there were too many Jewish bikers out there. I'd never really run into them in New York, but there are a couple. In the ring, the violence was very contained. And the further away you went from the ring, the more violent things got. And sort of once you slipped into the shadows, you'd start seeing really nasty things happening. So at the time that the Jews and the Gentiles are fighting in the ring in the back, out front on San Pablo Avenue some recyclers are maybe getting beaten up for instance.

DAVIES: Recyclers - these are, like, guys who pick up cans to get, you know, food for their habits or whatever, right?

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. I mean, there's a recycling center that's a few blocks from the clubhouse. And it's a source of constant tension in the neighborhood because not only are the recyclers with their shopping carts always clogging up San Pablo Avenue, but there are problems having to do with people's houses getting broken into, tools getting stolen, pipes getting stolen. In fact, the East Bay Rats' clubhouse was broken into while I was there and Trevor's plumbing was stolen.

And then there are also issues having to do with public urination, public defecation, prostitution, drug dealing. And remarkably enough, some of the recyclers seem to think that if they'd break their bags full of bottles - they're sold by weight. So they think that if they break their bags full of bottles they'll weigh more because broken glass weighs more than intact bottles. So there's this constant soundtrack of breaking glass.

DAVIES: You describe an incident that you witnessed between some members of the motorcycle club, the East Bay Rats, and a recycler. You want to tell us about that?

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. So the recyclers are kind of a constant presence and when the Rats drink beer, which they do all the time and in fact there's a soda machine that sells dollar beers in the clubhouse, they'll just toss the empties outside and the empties will be gone within 30 seconds or a minute. And that's their form of recycling.

So at the night of one of the fight nights, there was a recycler who kept hovering right around the door. And usually what'll happen at a fight night or an East Bay Rats party is all of the Rats and people belonging to other clubs will ride up to the clubhouse and park their bikes in a neat line down the length of the block. So it makes for quite a visual. And on one night, I saw there was a recycler who kept darting in in between their legs right outside the clubhouse front door to get the cans, basically, to get empty beer cans.

And, you know, there are often people hanging around the Rats who want to impress them, who want to be prospects for the club. And someone like that was around that evening. And he got up at one point, got up off the motorcycle he was sitting on, walked over to the recycler and shoved him hard into the line of bikes. And, you know, I was holding my breath, and for a minute I thought it was going to be OK, but it wasn't OK. Another Rat came up and touching the bike was enough it turned out. Everyone was drunk and a Rat went up and he knocked the man down to the ground. And then a couple of other Rats came out and they knocked the man to the ground. And San Pablo is a wide avenue. It's four lanes with a big median strip. And the man crawled over - the recycler crawled over the median strip and - onto the oncoming traffic lane. And I turned and I saw one of the Rats flip the visor on his helmet down and he was on his motorcycle and he rode it around the median strip. And he rode it up to the recycler who was lying on the ground at this point bleeding. And he rolled his bike back and forth sort of nudging the recycler a few times with the front tire. And then he gunned it and he rode over the recycler's torso, which was very horrible to watch and horrible to think about and horrible also to think that I could've done something to stop it in real time. And I didn't realize that in real time and didn't do anything to stop it, so not a proud moment for me.

DAVIES: And the recycler survived, got up and walked away?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I turned around and I thought I was going to throw up when I saw them ride over the recycler's body. And when I turned back around, the recycler was gone. I was expecting him to be lying on the cement with broken bones, but he had scampered away. The next time I saw Trevor, Trevor said, you'd be surprised. Crack heads are surprisingly resilient, and I said I wish I could've done something to stop it, and Trevor said you could've. All it takes is someone saying stop.

GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Alex Abramovich about his new book, ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll hear more of the interview after a break. And we'll remember The Beatles' record producer George Martin, who died yesterday at age 90. We'll listen back to an interview I recorded with him about helping shape their early sound and about producing ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Alex Abramovich about his new memoir, ""Bullies: A Friendship."" It's about reconnecting with a guy who'd bullied him when they were kids. When they reconnected, that guy, Trevor, was the head of a motorcycle club in East Oakland called the East Bay Rats, which was known for their bruising and brawling. The book is in part about that subculture.

DAVIES: What was the East Bay Rats' attitude towards racial diversity? I mean, there's - it's a city with a history of some racial issues certainly.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. I didn't know this before I started writing the book, but it turns out that many motorcycle clubs are formed along racial lines. I mean, they form along all sorts of lines. They form along - the police themselves in Oakland have a motorcycle club. In fact, there are two motorcycle clubs associated with the police out there. But well-known national clubs tend to break down along racial lines, and the Rats do not. There are African-American members. There are Jewish members, as I mentioned. There are Mexican-American members. So for the Rats, that's never really been an issue. It's very inclusive in that way. And it's also inclusive sexually I would say. Gays and lesbians are always welcome in the clubhouse. They're welcome in the - at fight nights. It's an interesting question what would happen if an openly gay man were to try to join the Rats. I'm not sure how that would fly. But in terms of people they hang out with, it's absolutely copacetic. So in that sense, the Rats are not - I would say that the Rats are more evolved in certain ways than our present political moment.

DAVIES: And what about their attitude towards women? You know, you hear of motorcycle clubs having women with - wearing things saying that they're the club's property.

ABRAMOVICH: I mean, they're not models of enlightened 21st-century, you know, men. And the gender roles are - tend to be a little old-fashioned maybe by standards employed elsewhere in the Bay Area. There are a couple of young women who hung out with the Rats. Bea (ph) and an Amber (ph) are their names, and they made themselves patches that read East Bay Cats (ph). So they were sort of like the girls auxiliary. But that's not quite the same as saying property of. On the other hand, it's certainly true - and I saw this time and again - that the Rats are both incredibly attractive for and aware of their own attractiveness to certain kinds of women in Oakland. And they take full advantage of that. And the full advantage of that might involve orgies in the back of the bar or the clubhouse. I don't think they really do this anymore. You know, they've aged out of it and they're family men now, but there was a lot of stuff going on in relation to girls.

DAVIES: Were there any stories of rape or sexual abuse of women in the club?

ABRAMOVICH: No. I never heard anything remotely about a rape and I think that I would've. I spent four years with those guys and I spent a lot of that time with people who didn't like those guys, so I would've heard about it. I heard a lot of messed up sexual stories, but nothing that wasn't consensual.

The one thing that happened while I was out there was that at one of the fight nights there was a man that assaulted a young woman. And they were making out and he started choking her and then she was on the ground and then she ran into the clubhouse covered in blood. And she said that this guy had tried to rape her and the Rats came down immediately like avenging angels, and they beat that guy to within an inch of his life. And Trevor said that as I was hitting him I was really sad because I really like this guy but here he was, you know, but then he also felt sad that he didn't break the guy's legs with a shovel.

DAVIES: Because there was a code of some kind.

ABRAMOVICH: The code is - there are rules. They're written down. I wasn't allowed to see them. Prospects aren't even allowed to see them. You're only allowed to see them once you patch in as a member. But I know what some of the rules are, and there are rules governing the treatment of women and the word respect comes up very often. So not only do you not disrespect women when they're around you but you especially respect each other's girlfriends. You have to ask permission before you date someone's ex-girlfriend. As you would imagine, this leads to a certain amount of friction.

DAVIES: You spent some time with the motorcycle club the East Bay Rats when you were writing a magazine article. Then you went back to New York and eventually came back to Oakland with your girlfriend and lived there for quite a while. So you had a lot of experience and spent a lot of time with the guys in the club. What did they think of you?

ABRAMOVICH: They didn't know what to make of me. The first time I met them when I was writing the magazine article, Trevor had told everyone that I was his bully, so they couldn't wait to see the guy who had bullied the president of their motorcycle club. And they were surprised when this, you know, 5-foot-8 guy with glasses stepped out of his rental car.

DAVIES: (Laughter).

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor does not wear glasses and he's well over 6 feet tall. And they did what they would do to anyone that they liked initially - they hazed me. And they put me on a motorcycle on my first full day in Oakland, my first morning in Oakland. And they put me on a motorcycle that I was guaranteed to crash, which I did crash. And I crashed it right away and I crashed it badly. I think they expected a smaller crash, but I crashed it in style. And I broke my hand, but weirdly enough, my hand - I don't know if it was the adrenaline or just the way the nerves are arranged, but for whatever reason my hand didn't hurt until I got back to New York. So instead of going to the hospital, I wrapped it up in boxing tape and I stayed out there for a week, and I kept reporting.

So in a sense we sort of got the hazing out of the way very early and I think that I ended up presenting or appearing as a much braver person than I actually am. If my hand had actually been hurting I would've gone to the hospital. But then the magazine article came out six or seven months later and the Rats liked that very much. They're not criminals, so they don't make any money off the club, so the coin for them is publicity. And they're savvy when it comes to publicity, and this was publicity on a grand national scale, so they liked that a lot.

So the magazine article came out, and it brought them a fair amount of welcome attention, including sexual attention, and they like that. So there was a certain amount of goodwill, I would say, built in by the time I arrived back at the club. But it's a club with, you know, as I said, 35 members and some of them like the cameras and some of them don't like the cameras. And that's a dynamic in and of itself, just having a camera changes what's happening at the clubhouse. So there were Rats that didn't like me at all and probably still don't like me and they pretty much stayed away from me. John Firpo, who we mentioned already, took a very active dislike to me. And John Firpo is a very large and very intimidating, scary dude. And that was unpleasant. John and I got along fine now, but...

DAVIES: Well, I was going to - did you feel afraid ever? I mean, you were there for some long nights with a lot of drinking and I'm sure they got really rowdy. Did you feel afraid?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I didn't feel afraid because I was in - I was working. I was there to take notes. I was drinking sometimes, but I was still working. And there was a sort of circle of safety involved when you were with Trevor. So as long as I stayed within that circle of safety, I felt OK. Now, there were things that happened at the periphery that were not OK and that were scary and frightening and genuinely I would say lightweight dangerous.

DAVIES: Alex Abramovich is our guest. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, we're speaking with writer Alex Abramovich. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" It's about him reconnecting with a kid he'd known from his youth who turns out to have founded a motorcycle club in Oakland. Alex Abramovich spent a lot of time there.

You know, it's interesting. There are places in the book where you have long extended stories quoted verbatim from some of the bikers, particularly Trevor. I assume you carried a tape recorder a lot of the time. And he certainly sounds very well spoken. You do say you wondered at points if he was a sociopath. What made you wonder that?

ABRAMOVICH: Things he did. To give two very brief examples - one was a story that he told me. I picked him up one day. We were going somewhere and he said, you know, it's funny. A crackhead was peeing on my door last night and I opened up the door and there he was. And I took a shovel and, you know, I broke the guy's arm. I could tell I'd broken his arm from the way it was flopping around. But then, you know, I walked inside and I turned on the PlayStation and I was playing ""Star Wars Battlefront"" and I got the highest score I've ever gotten. I thought that was a strange story.

DAVIES: Trevor's life did change over time, right? What's he up to now?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor's got a very heteronormative life now. I mean, it was pretty heteronormative before, but now it's a pretty just normative let's say. He lives in Emeryville now, which is a small town next to Oakland. He moved out of Oakland because everyone is getting priced out of Oakland these days, or as Trevor put it, Oakland's getting nicer and that's great, but if it gets too much nicer, we'll all have to leave. So he left.

He got a job doing outdoor work with the city of Albany, which is another small town nearby that has really good schools that he can send his kids to. And Trevor has two little boys now. He got married. He stopped being a bouncer. At some point, he bought himself a purple Harley-Davidson. These guys all ride very fast Japanese sports bikes that they customize and turn into Rat bikes - what they call them. But Trevor bought this, you know, giant thing out of ""Purple Rain"" with a CD player, which he's since gotten rid of. Even that was too much for him. But he's got a - Trevor's very wily and he's sort of set himself up with the life that he wants and on the surface at least it looks pretty much like, you know, this American life.

DAVIES: And is there less violence in his life?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I never saw Trevor - Trevor got into fights while I was there at the bar, but I never saw Trevor inside the ring. I never actually saw him box. He and I sparred together. He taught me how to box, but I never saw him that directly involved in violence. Now he's not a bouncer at the club anymore, so that takes that whole part out of the equation. They still have fight nights, and the club's actually thriving now. It was in a bit of a lull when I was out there.

So on the one hand, he's surrounded by violence, but on the other hand, you know, he's also a father now. And he told me a funny story just this week actually. They were having a fight night and his boy Mason (ph) was there. And Mason's about 2-and-a-half, maybe going on 3 now. And Mason had seen lots of boxing and ultimate fighting on TV and he'd seen people spar at the clubhouse, but he'd never seen an actual fight. And now people are fighting in the boxing ring. And these were people that he knows and loves and cares about and they're hurting each other and they're getting hurt. And Trevor looked down at Mason and he thought, oh, my God, am I one of those parents? What am I exposing my kid to? And before he could do anything, Mesa looked up at his mom and handed her his dinosaurs and ran into the clubhouse. And Trevor - you know, Trevor went after him and he was expecting to find Mason in the corner crying, but instead Trevor said Mason was in there hitting the heavy bag.

DAVIES: Wow (laughter). How well do you feel that you know him? I mean, are you good friends now? Do you feel like you understand him?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, he's my oldest friend, I think. I've known him for 30 - is that right - 35 years now and I'm only 43. And I'm his oldest friend. So in a sense there's a very deep connection and whenever we don't see each other for a while, we pick up the thread very quickly. As far as understanding him, I think my understanding of him is contained in that I can sort of walk around him and describe him. And I think I did a pretty good job of it in the book of describing how he comes across, how his very, very unusual mind works. But in terms of really, really going in there and untangling the motivations, yeah, you know, the short answer is I do think I get it and I think I described it. He functions under tremendous internal pressures and he has absorbed a great deal of poison and he's gotten better and better at with every passing year at lancing that poison and finding productive ways to - or at least non-self-destructive ways to let seep back out into the world.

DAVIES: Well, Alex Abramovich, thanks so much for speaking with us.

ABRAMOVICH: Thanks so much, Dave. It was a pleasure.

GROSS: Alex Abramovich is the author of the new memoir ""Bullies: A Friendship."" He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies, who is also WHYY's senior reporter. Coming up, we remember George Martin who produced 13 albums by The Beatles. He died yesterday. We'll listen back to my interview with him about working with The Beatles. This is FRESH AIR.

Some people in the line were not sure what to do with their phones. A man in his mid-50s, who'd traveled all the way from Kansas with his sister, thought it would be fine to keep his hidden away in his pocket. He had no intention of using it, he said. But he's been diagnosed with cancer and, understandably, was a little anxious about being uncontactable for several hours, so far away from home in the depths of Minnesota.

""You use it, you lose it!"" bellowed Paisley Park staff as we waited at a local bus station to receive our wristbands and be transported in coaches to the venue. Holders of VIP tickets ($250) were allowed to park at Paisley. But however much you'd paid for a ticket, one rule was being enforced above all others: no cellphones, no cameras. There were quite a few locals in the friendly, mostly middle-aged crowd, people who'd been to Paisley many times. They were unequivocal. ""Don't bother bringing a phone,"" said Sean, who was dressed in a purple suit. ""They'll take it off you."" I locked mine in the rental car, away from temptation. Most others did the same, including the gentleman from Kansas. Prince, armed with just a microphone and a piano, was playing a couple of intimate midweek shows in one night, in his own studio complex just outside Minneapolis.

""From all over the world, the people came,"" brags Prince's last great B-side, before the Internet changed the way we think of singles. The song is called ""Rock 'n' Roll is Alive (And It Lives In Minneapolis),"" and on a cold night in January, both the opening lyric and the title of this 1995 track still seemed to hold true. Given Prince's notoriously antagonistic relationship with the Internet, it is not a surprise that this song is unavailable to legally stream or download anywhere.

There are probably two main reasons for the cellphone ban at Paisley Park. First is an attempt to preserve the purity of the live music experience, to encourage people to watch and absorb the show rather than their screens. Apart from a woman who used her phone flashlight to look for something she'd dropped, earning a stern word from an alert member of staff, everyone seemed to respect the rules. At one point, while he scrolled through his iPad, deciding what to play next, Prince playfully asked why everyone was looking at him. Later, I could only find a single, blurry image from the show on social media.

The other reason is Prince's fierce commitment to protection of copyright. He does not take kindly to unauthorized recordings and images. There is surprisingly little to be found in places like YouTube. What does exist is usually unauthorized and only survives for as long as it takes to issue a takedown notice. Which Prince, or whoever he's paying to handle this task, does with great regularity. There is plenty of Prince material on non-U.S. video sites, which are harder to deal with under American law.

""Copyright law has not caught up with the way the Internet works,"" explains Professor Chris Bavitz of Harvard Law School. ""The Internet itself is premised on making copies. Every time you load a web page you are making a copy. But technically, according to the U.S. Copyright Act, you are violating the rights of whoever owns the content on that page.""

Bavitz has been immersed in the music industry for many years. Between 2003 and 2008 he was in-house counsel at EMI, at the time one of the four major record labels. Among other things, he now teaches a Music and Digital Media class at Harvard.

Today, relatively few people buy physical copies of music. After its slow initial response to the rise of illegal file-sharing in the 2000s, the industry now supplies music in several ways using the Internet. You can pay to download individual tracks and albums using something like iTunes; you can stream music of your choice by subscribing to a service like Spotify; you can select a genre or artist on Pandora and let the service's algorithm choose similar songs for you. Artists also have their own channels on audio and video platforms like Soundcloud and YouTube, to which fans can subscribe for free. But Prince has mostly stood apart from these developments.

""The Internet's completely over,"" he said in 2010. ""I don't see why I should give my new music to iTunes or anyone else."" Since then, Prince has removed most of his music from the streaming service Spotify, instead aligning with the newer, smaller, Jay-Z-backed Tidal. There is some music available on iTunes, but the latest releases appear several weeks earlier on Tidal. There are many Prince songs and albums that are completely unavailable on any of the major digital platforms.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), an important civil liberty organization that specifically focuses on digital technology, created The Raspberry Beret Lifetime Aggrievement Award for Prince, in 2013, because of his ""extraordinary abuses of the takedown process in the name of silencing speech."" It sees Prince's takedowns not merely as a copyright issue, in which an artist can claim to be protecting his work, but as outright censorship.

In 2007, Stephanie Lenz posted a 29-second video of her young children dancing in the kitchen. Faintly in the background, the Prince song ""Let's Go Crazy"" is playing. The correct response would probably have been to do nothing, but Universal Music, Prince's label at the time, decided to issue a takedown. The ensuing legal battle, in which the EFF represents Lenz, is still not quite over after nine long years of decisions and appeals. Though he's not the plaintiff, the EFF still blames Prince.

The association is understandable. That same year, Prince not only threatened legal action against eBay and YouTube but also against three websites that were run by his fans. He wanted them to remove anything linked to his likeness: photos, album art, even images of Prince-inspired tattoos. A letter from his lawyers asked them to provide ""substantive details of the means by which you propose to compensate our clients [Paisley Park Entertainment Group, NPG Records and AEG] for damages."" In response, the fansites formed a coalition, Prince Fans United, to contest the action. Prince then created a one-off website where he uploaded an unflattering song about them, the frankly awesome ""PFunk."" In the end, nobody got sued and pretty much everyone loved the track. ""With everything that's going on, we continue to listen to his music,"" said Karen Avera from the Housequake fansite, at the time. ""We'll continue to buy his music, because we appreciate his music."" But it was an ugly episode, nonetheless.

Infamously, Prince managed to take down a YouTube clip of himself performing a cover of Radiohead's ""Creep"" at the Coachella music festival in 2008, despite the band's lead singer Thom Yorke making it very clear who the song actually belongs to. The law does not provide a great deal of clarity in these cases, unfortunately.

""My guess is that Prince at least claimed to be an owner or co-owner of the rights in this video, even if not the song, thus giving him the right to demand its removal,"" says Bavitz. ""But, actually parsing out the basis for that claim is a bit messy."" The video was uploaded yet again last year, this time apparently with Prince's approval. He's now using Twitter and Instagram again and posted a link to it.

YouTube

Among his devoted fans, who have vast collections of Prince albums and have seen him live many times, there is a general acceptance of this stance. They don't worry too much about the lack of grainy clips on YouTube or the absence of music on Spotify.

Some I met at Paisley Park shook their heads in weary resignation as they muttered, ""Yeah, he hates the Internet.""

Amanda Palmer certainly does not hate the Internet. The singer/songwriter is famous for her personal interactions with fans, both on and offline. She has more than a million Twitter followers; she takes the time to answer many of their questions and generally engage in conversation; she allows all photography and filming at her live shows. This is pretty much the opposite of Prince's approach. Palmer has built such a rapport with fans that she managed to raise $1.2 million on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, to support a tour and the recording of a 2012 album. This was not without some controversy, with a few musicians upset about her calls for volunteers to play on some songs alongside her main band.

Palmer grew up idolizing Prince. But the music industry has changed since the days when she had posters of him on her bedroom wall. She makes an analogy with the silent movie stars who, brilliant as they may have been, could not cope with the inevitability of a technological revolution that would pass them by. Prince was successful in an era of lucrative music sales  and, to be fair, patient support from a major record label  that has now largely gone. ""What Prince wants is just not possible anymore,"" she says. ""But it is important that people don't hold it against him. He grew up and is completely fluent in a language that is dying. Almost all of my early heroes are struggling in the same way.""

But it is not clear that technology is the main issue here. Even before the Internet came along, Prince was trying to control the distribution of his music. At the Paisley Park concert, many people were exchanging stories of how and where they got hold of old bootleg Prince recordings. This is how an artist like Prince truly endures, how dedicated fandom develops. For these people, Purple Rain is for the masses.

For an obsessive teenage music fan, an artist's official back catalog is rarely sufficient. In London in the early 1990s, a few of us would pick up the Northern Line from Kings Cross and make the short journey to Camden Town. There, in the famous, sprawling market surrounding by indie-music pubs full of underage drinkers, we'd head for the music stalls to look for unofficial tracks, concert recordings, demos, whatever we could get our hands on. I still have a poor-quality vinyl pressing of the once-legendary Black Album.

Very early on a sunny morning in 1994, a small group of us once again headed to Camden. Not, this time, to buy more tapes in the market, but because Prince was actually opening his own store there. He wasn't even called Prince that day, because he had changed his name to a symbol and was in the middle of a fight to extract himself from his contract at Warner Brothers. A few dozen people were waiting patiently. Presumably they'd also been mocked at school. My mum had made sandwiches.

At its peak, the crowd was no bigger than a couple of hundred. Bear in mind this was one of the most famous people in the world just showing up in a popular, touristy part of London. But we had no Internet access, no cellphones, no digital cameras. We only knew about it because one of us subscribed to a photocopied, crudely stapled fanzine. Today, social media would force the police to shut the whole thing down. Eventually, Prince himself appeared on the balcony, wearing a bright yellow jumpsuit. He cut a ribbon, waved for a few seconds, the crowd went nuts and he was gone. I bought posters, some CDs and regrettably, a large earring in the shape of the Prince symbol.

Sadly, there are very few records of that day  a Google search only reveals a few poor quality photos and a very early online forum discussion with about four participants. The store closed down two years later, but it was an early attempt by Prince to bypass established music industry distribution channels.

My old friend Sidh Solanki was with us that morning. An extremely talented musician even as a teenager, he has since forged a successful career as a producer and is now based in Los Angeles. Solanki, despite his deep roots in the industry, does not listen to music on Spotify or any other streaming service, partly because he feels it doesn't compensate music creators properly. ""These people have been pumping music out to their subscribers for years without paying people for their copyrights,"" he says. ""Prince has a lot to be wary of when he puts music out there.""

Nobody thought the music royalties system was completely fair in the old days, but Solanki suggests that it was at least straightforward. The record label would manage the process and he got a certain amount every time someone bought a record or it got played on the radio. But now, he thinks they have changed listeners' expectations. ""Music is now freely available everywhere so it has no value to the consumer,"" he says.

A recent report from the Berklee School of Music in Boston is highly critical of the streaming services and their investors, who happen to include major record labels. Essentially, the report accuses the music industry of a deliberate lack of transparency. The technology exists to track downloads and streams to a very fine degree, something that would enable artists to see what they are owed and help create a common standard. It might not make everyone rich but it would at least be fair. But the industry chooses not to use technology that is easily available, so we now have, the report says, ""a tremendously mismatched ecosystem in which we have surface-level, profit-generating elements without the proper digital infrastructure to support them.""

""The resulting opaque industry,"" it concludes starkly, ""is one in which many artists can reach a wide number of fans, but only a few can truly make a living from their craft, and even fewer can understand the problems they are facing.""

Prince probably does not need to earn a living any more. He can charge $250 a ticket for a concert in his house. But Solanki still approves of his attempts to control distribution and experiment with new methods of getting his music and brand out there, which includes that London store more than twenty years ago. ""Prince is just doing what he thinks is best,"" he says. ""We have maybe a few years before we figure out the norms for where we get our music from and how we all get paid properly. There isn't a solution yet. Because if he hasn't found it, no-one's found it.""

Towards the end of Prince's most commercially successfully period, Galaxie 500, a critically-acclaimed indie rock band, formed at Harvard in the late eighties. Damon Krukowski, the band's soft-spoken drummer, says the three musicians who had made up the group took a major hit with the rise of digital music services. They used to make a clear profit on physical records sold and a successful album could generate enough income to live on for a while, even though they accepted early on that they were never going to be selling millions. Streaming not only killed off the idea of a back catalog as a chronology of music, but dramatically reduced their income.

Prince, says Krukowski, has thought harder about the industry than other musicians. He is entrepreneurial and ambitious. ""Prince was always destined to be a pop star and had his eye on being huge,"" he says. ""But he would show up and watch these obscure bands that only other musicians liked, in tiny venues in Minneapolis. He always wanted to know everything that was going on.""

Krukowski thinks artists should abandon the idea of expecting fans to pay to stream their music and just offer that particular service for free. They could still sell downloads on iTunes and elsewhere. In his view, it would be fairer and more practical for digital streams to ""flow freely  from everyone, fans included  instead of only from companies that have cut deals with the copyright holders."" That way, at least everyone is on a level playing field. ""I believe if we relinquish control and claim over the stream,"" he says. ""We clarify what it is we actually do own and can profit from as musicians and songwriters.""

For emerging artists today, there is an acceptance that streaming services in their current form, however unfair their business practices might seem when it comes to royalties, cannot be ignored. The Internet in general offers an enormous opportunity to reach audiences  and generate revenue from elsewhere  at a scale that was once impossible without the backing of a record label. Prince was 18 when Warner Brothers gave him a multi-album deal, even allowing the precocious teenager to produce his own albums. It was not until his fifth effort, 1999, that he could be considered a major star. His sixth, incidentally, was Purple Rain. This level of patience and support was unusual at the time but it would not happen at all today.

Dani Leigh was also just 18 when Prince invited her to direct the video for his ""Breakfast Can Wait"" single in 2013. Two years later, as one half of the duo Curly Fryz, the Florida native performed on the standout track of a recent Prince album, a storming piece of braggadocio funk called ""Like A Mack."" As a new solo artist, she says she is lucky to have Prince in her corner. But unlike her mentor, she is not in a position to shun the Internet. Her first single is available on every platform. ""That's where everyone gets their music nowadays,"" she says. ""It's easier for Prince to do what he does, because he's Prince. A lot of people will go out of their way to find his music.""

He still refuses to back down. ""I was right about [the Internet],"" Prince said in November 2015. Leigh worries about his legacy among a new generation of music fans, because of his absence from Spotify and YouTube. ""I know a lot of younger kids who don't know Prince and don't realize who he is,"" she says.

Although nobody else of his status behaves this way today, a decade ago, just before he started threatening to sue everyone in sight, Prince was considered a genuine Internet hero: ""It is with great pleasure and admiration that we present The Webby Lifetime Achievement award to Prince, who has forever altered the landscape of online musical distribution as the first major artist to release an entire album  1997's Crystal Ball  exclusively on the web. Prince's leadership online has transformed the entertainment industry and reshaped the relationship between artist and fan.""

From the very beginning, Prince had always been interested in computers and how an artist might use them, says Berklee professor and Prince fan Ben Houge. Songs like ""Something In The Water (Does Not Compute)"" (1982) and ""Computer Blue"" (1984) were early examples right there in his music; in the Internet era there are tracks like ""Emale"" and ""My Computer"" (both 1996). The latter's lyrics are even prescient of social media: ""I scanned my computer, looking for a site. Somebody to talk to, funny and bright.""

Later, he used the available technology to create ""experiences,"" not merely albums, that were more than just music, combining sound, visuals and a sense of interactivity. The liner notes for 1997's Crystal Ball, specifically cited by the Webby Awards, were presented as a web page, which was unique at the time. Professor Houge argues that Prince is sensitive to everything that is part of a musical experience. ""Of course it's incredibly convenient to have music instantly accessible on a streaming service, but so much information is lost,"" he says. ""Not only textual information like credits, lyrics, bios and essays but also visual information like photos, font, layout and graphic design, so many things that convey an important extra-musical dimension to an artist's vision.""

In 2001, Prince launched his most ambitious Internet project of all, the NPG Music Club, a subscription service that was initially priced at $100 a year. It was an attempt to distribute exclusive new music directly to fans and give members first preference and VIP access to concerts. It also featured a weekly, fan-hosted radio show. It didn't always work very well. Eventually, the price was lowered to just $25 for a lifetime membership, so I too signed up. I never got a VIP pass to a concert.

The site closed down in 2006, the same year Prince won the lifetime Webby. There has never been a prince.com, a consistent, high-quality Internet home. Someone has registered the domain but there is no website. Prince has instead had a series of short-lived sites, dating all the way back to thedawn.com in 1996. Most of them were designed to sell a specific album or event and none lasted very long. He periodically dips in and out of social media.

This is not the only musical genius to have tried, with limited success, to use the Internet and realize its potential for music. ""Peace, David Bowie,"" said Prince, quietly and a little unexpectedly, as he was sitting at his piano at Paisley Park. ""I only met him once. He was nice to me. Seems like he was nice to everyone."" It was a gentle, humble moment.

In 1994, Bowie was the first major artist to release a song solely on the Internet, was also into interactive experiences, and by 1998, had gone a lot further than Prince by launching his own service provider, Bowienet, which offered Internet access, a Bowienet email address and an official, high-quality Bowie website that was full of music and visual material. By 2002, Bowie had accepted that the Internet would change the way musicians functioned. ""I'm fully confident that copyright, for instance, will no longer exist in 10 years, and authorship and intellectual property is in for such a bashing,"" he told The New York Times. ""You'd better be prepared for doing a lot of touring because that's really the only unique situation that's going to be left.""

Bowie was wrong about the demise of copyright but right about the increased value of live performances. In the 2000s, Prince did not sell many records but was one of the highest-grossing live acts in the world. In 1996, following his debilitating battle with Warners  the era of the unpronounceable symbol for a name and ""slave"" written on his face  the comedian Chris Rock had also told Prince to just get on the stage. ""You talk about owning your music,"" said Rock. ""The thing you have that is worth more than anything else is your reputation as a live performer, which will feed you when all else fails.""

Prince's entire history with the Internet can be understood in terms of a great artist experimenting with available technology to retain control of his music and artistic vision, trying to maintain a separation between live performance and recordings, and achieving a business model that rewards artists for their work and talent. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, an era of largely open platforms  before iTunes, Spotify, social media  what he wanted to achieve might have seemed possible. But neither the NPG Music Club nor Bowienet were suited to the way the Internet was changing and, looking back, it is perhaps no surprise they were both finished by 2006. Ultimately, Houge thinks Prince has tried really hard: ""I think his issues with the Internet, relatively recent in his long-term relationship with the medium, are more a result of disappointment of the ways in which its potential has not been realized than in a lack of vision.""

It was approaching 2:00 a.m. when the lights went up and we were gently ushered to the heated coaches that would return us to our cars a couple of miles away. It was cold outside and there was light snow. ""There aren't any rules in Paisley Park,"" Prince had sung, but many would beg to differ.

For nearly four hours, the performances were perfect, with just one or two songs repeated across the two concerts. Prince was relaxed and funny, and played the obscure songs this crowd craved, as well as some of the bigger hits. There are nearly 40 albums to choose from. For many fans, it is not an overstatement to describe this as a pilgrimage, a visit to the birthplace of the soundtrack to their lives. Prince's staff filmed the performance but it is likely that the footage will end up in his semi-mythical vault, where it is thought he stores thousands of recordings that very few people have heard.

On the Internet, meanwhile, there is that solitary unauthorized photo on Instagram and nothing at all of this concert on YouTube. If you want to see the show, to have the memories, you have to buy a ticket. The Internet can do great things for music but it still cannot replicate an experience like this.",[]

When she was 17, Tracey Helton Mitchell was prescribed an opioid pain killer after getting her wisdom teeth extracted. The medicine helped her deal with the pain related to the extraction, but when the prescription ran out, her desire for its euphoric high remained. That's when she turned to heroin.

As a teenager, Mitchell imagined heroin to be glamorous, but she found it wasn't once she became an addict. She tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that the drug ruined her health and her self-esteem. She lived in an alley, shot drugs into the bottom of her feet, sold her body for money and was jailed several times. She was also featured in a 1999 documentary about addicts called Black Tar Heroin.

At one of her lowest points, Mitchell says, ""I was having heart palpitations, because I was using stimulants, and I thought, 'They're going to pull me out of this hotel, I have no ID, my parents, my family ... will never know that I died and I'll just be a Jane Doe and this is how I'm going to expire in this place.' ""

But Mitchell didn't die from her addiction. Rather, with the help of the nondenominational 12-step program LifeRing and other support groups and therapies, she eventually stopped using and became a certified addiction specialist. She has been clean for 18 years.

In her new memoir, The Big Fix, Mitchell writes about her addiction and her path to recovery, and also shares insights into today's heroin epidemic. When it comes to our current treatment system, Mitchell says we would do better to reach out to addicts as individuals, by recognizing each user's unique needs and motivations.

Our current method of treatment is ""sort of a one-size-[fits]-all approach,"" she says. ""We need to have a variety of different kinds of treatment interventions that address people's needs.""

Interview Highlights

On what it's like to watch Black Tar Heroin now that she's clean

It can be painful to watch, especially when I think about my life now and I contrast that. ... My legs did look like I was dropped in a dumpster and picked out by rats. I had, I think, 34 or 36 abscesses. I have scars that have healed, but I had to have surgeries on some and in the summertime when everybody else is wearing shorts and stuff like that, I see those things  even right now sitting here at the table I can see one of the scars on my arms. It's a good thing in that it reminds me of where I was, but then it's also very challenging, because this documents a very unpleasant part of my life that can't be changed.

On why she agreed to be filmed

I really believed that I was going to die, or be murdered. There was lots of evidence to make me feel that way, and I wanted it to be something that people would see after I was dead that showed that heroin was not the glamorous thing that I had thought it was when I was a teenager and had imagined it. I wasn't paid for the film; it was a huge inconvenience in my life, but I feel like it still is sort of my legacy to the world, because it's something that's watched today. Millions of people still watch it.

On black tar heroin in the '90s versus heroin today

There's still tar heroin. The heroin that most people get today is much, much stronger. We didn't have to worry about fentanyl  of us dropping dead from an overdose, because no one cut it with fentanyl. The thing that we really worried about was getting flesh-eating [bacteria, necrotizing fasciitis] ... or getting some kind of wound botulism or getting abscesses. There certainly were overdoses then. You could get arrested for overdosing and a lot of people were rolled out at the hospitals or left outside to die ... but there wasn't this culture of heroin where heroin is prevalent absolutely everywhere. It was more localized to big cities, more urban areas.

On 'hitting bottom'

i toggle caption Michael Kerner Photography/Seal Press Michael Kerner Photography/Seal Press

I don't believe in the concept of a bottom. I think that if the opposite of addiction is connection, that addicts or people who use drugs are really seeking out  they need some kind of connection with people. And I would say I've had a wide variety of bottoms, but I wasn't ready to stop until I started to believe that there was a possibility that I actually could stop and saw reasons for myself to stop, and my motivation is totally different.

On being ready to get clean

One of the myths about addiction is that you come to this incredible moment of clarity and that you decide that you're going to stop. And so over the course of my using I had various moments of clarity and I had various points where I had wanted to stop, but they were not always congruent with my opportunities.

So there [were] very few opportunities where I really could truly try to stop, but I would stop using for a few days, I'd try to kick on my own, I'd switch to different drugs, I'd move to different places. I tried different things to stop, but I wasn't completely ready, because all these different traumas had accumulated in my life, and I wasn't prepared to deal with the emotional consequences of all these different things. And that's what to me being off drugs meant  was that I would have to then figure out how I was going to fix all these things on my own. And it wasn't until I got an idea that maybe other people would help me, talking to my mother, knowing that I would have some kind of emotional support where I'd start seeing [that] maybe I don't have to totally do all of this on my own.

On needle exchange programs

At the time there was no needle exchange at all [in Cincinnati] and so you would use the same syringe over and over again and hopefully it didn't break off in your arm. Until the numbers wore off of it, you would sharpen it on a matchbook, and it was just horrible; it was like a rusty nail sticking in your arm.

So I came to San Francisco and they had needle exchanges, which was a revelation, because so many people in the country were suffering from HIV and AIDS, particularly AIDS, because there was no anti-retrovirals. ... So the syringe exchange people provided me education about my drug use. ...

I've seen in my life so many examples of where not having a clean syringe never stopped anyone. I've seen people pick them up out of the gutters. Even here in San Francisco, where there's a lot of access, people break open sharps containers that they've stolen from hospitals because they needed a syringe and they don't have one. ... It doesn't stop people. All it does is spread a public health crisis.

On harm reduction and the argument that harm reduction enables users

My answer is, you can't get clean if you're dead, so there has to be harm reduction. We're not encouraging people to do anything, we're taking a look at their public health behaviors and then addressing what the particular needs are, so look at the cost of one syringe versus the cost of someone getting hepatitis C and having to take care of them for a lifetime.

Look at the public health cost of various other medical conditions that a person can have. From not using sterile water or alcohol pads, someone having endocarditis or some other infection, so having a safe system for people to take care of themselves and treating addicts, users not just addicts, there's plenty of people who use who are not necessarily considered on the spectrum of drug addicts, treating people humanely and having them have access to public health services and the things that they need.

On coping with depression since becoming clean

Part of the reason why I wanted to write The Big Fix is because I felt like there's no ... real education on long-term recovery about what really happens over time. So dealing with topics like untreated depression and anxiety and all the other kind of things that you go through when you take the drugs away, and then you have new issues, because before you use drugs, you didn't have all these guilty, shameful things that you ... now have to deal with, if you're a person like me and you get off drugs.

So I've had a very complicated relationship with my emotions in the past 18 years that I've been clean. I've dealt with very serious post-traumatic stress disorder, being very checked out and dissociative at various points, having to deal with the constant specter of depression, every once in a while having suicidal thoughts. And one of the things that I try to do is really normalize those feelings when people want to know what recovery is really like. It's like, some days you really feel crappy. You really have some things that are going on with you, and I think the prevalent idea is that you get clean and everything is supposed to be great. ... You can have a great life and still not feel all that great.",[]

i LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR

The Internet has not killed the book.

For film critic David Denby, this wasn't immediately obvious. He would watch young people hunched over their phones  on the subway, in coffee shops, walking down the street  and wonder: Are kids still learning to read books?

Denby, who is best known for his work in The New Yorker, went back to high school to find out. He describes his experience in Lit Up: One Reporter. Three Schools. Twenty-Four Books That Can Change Lives.

He followed three high school English classes for a full year: a 10th-grade class at The Beacon School in Manhattan, Mamaroneck High School near New York City and James Hillhouse High School in New Haven, Conn.

Seated on a table in the back of a New York classroom  pushing copies of Shakespeare and Herman Hesse out of the way to make space for himself Denby learned that schools can absolutely still teach kids to love literature.

I asked him to talk about some of his discoveries. Here's our conversation, edited for length:

Why did you only look at three schools, and why did you look at the students in those schools so intensely?

I dislike this American metric prejudice whereby no assertion can be considered of any value unless it's backed up with statistics, surveys, probabilities. Particularly in the education world.

We're talking about young people becoming adults. Becoming themselves. Becoming souls. Becoming conscious. And I don't see how that's measurable.

And I was sick of failure.

I was sick of almost the pornographic reveling in American ineptitude. I wanted to see something that worked.

I didn't want to write a handbook for teachers. I didn't want to write a survey. I wanted to follow one organic development of a class.

I chose Beacon because someone told me about the school. I found that this was a very interesting class because this guy, Sean Leon, was asking students questions that challenged them, I don't know how else to put it, existentially. I mean, they were reading Dostoyevsky and Herman Hesse and Vonnegut, and Faulkner and Hawthorne and so on.

The books that they read tended, with his help, to focus attention to these questions: Who are you? Why do you live? Where are you going? What are you doing?

You know, if you take a typically sarcastic, joking, self-deprecating, media-hip American teenager and scratch him two or three times, you'll find this sort of earnestly questing person underneath. That's what he did.

So, not every school is Beacon ...

Hillhouse is a large inner-city school ... a very different environment.

The kids had strength of feeling and perception. What they weren't, was eager readers.

At the beginning of the year, these were 15- and 16-year-olds, African-American kids, they weren't willing to do the reading at all. The teacher would give them an assignment and they would come in the next day and be blank about it. They couldn't see, particularly the boys, the point of reading in English class. What was it going to do for them?

So that was what Jessica Zylenski, the teacher [at Hillhouse], was trying to engage with and, if necessary, break down.

It's funny to me because, you explicitly said that your book is not a handbook. But the Hillhouse chapters, they do tend to focus on techniques that teachers might use.

The issue always was: How do you get them started?

They read To Kill A Mockingbird, which may seem an odd choice. In other words, they read about poor white people in Alabama in 1930. She wanted them, however, to go from those lives to their own life. From how people lived then to how they lived in New Haven in the 21st century.

So initially they were unwilling to read and they started reading in class together, and then she started moving them to other things. They tried a little Shakespeare. A little Melville. They loved stories by Vonnegut and Hemingway. By the end of the year, they were choosing among four books. And she plunged them into difficult and tragic material because that was what seemed real to them.

I want to pivot back to Sean Leon's class. He always seems to see them right where they are and get them where they need to go.

Well, I know I could never be a teacher.

To be a great teacher, you have to be in touch with what 15 or 20 or, in Sean Leon's case, 32 teenagers are feeling at any one moment.

He has that sixth or seventh sense of where the kids are and how far he can push them. He would plunge into a text, play them off against each other. He never just sat down, laid down the law.

He would pull them out of their defensiveness and get them to perform. Jump from the text and to bring it right into the center of their lives.

I am always bothered by people saying, ""Technology is the worst thing that could happen to the world."" But that's not what you do here.

Exactly. I mean, who am I to say that only literature matters and only books matter? I spent 45 years as a movie critic.

I am addicted to email. I use Facebook and so on. I'm on the Web for all sorts of information. But I also love best to read, and I feel I have to pull back.

He [teacher Sean Leon] was saying you've got to have yourself. You've got to have your family. You've got to have conversation. Movies are fine. The Internet is incredibly useful. But don't think you're going to find yourself there. You may find certain reflections of yourself, but you cannot find your soul there.

In the book, Leon's students wind up doing a pretty good analysis of the hypocrisy of the show Teen Mom. It's almost like he's saying: ""It's fine to be watching TV, but think critically about it.""

I mean, it's an enormously powerful critical tool, reading literature and addressing the world. It's not simple lessons, of course. And it doesn't happen overnight. It's incremental. It happens over your entire life.

All of life is an education.",[]
npr.org,2010-07-18 00:00:00,Is One-Year Anniversary Redundant?,['Ben Zimmer'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Neale Gifford writes: ""One practice that annoys me is the use of 'one-year anniversary' or 'five-year anniversary' instead of 'first' or 'fifth.' Reason? Anniversary is derived from the Latin annus meaning 'year.' "" Ed Morman writes of ""n-year anniversary,"" ""It's not very mellifluous and it is, of course redundant. Help me bring back 'nth anniversary.' ""



Gifford and Morman aren't alone in their irritation. A few years ago, when The San Francisco Chronicle ran a headline reading, ""Four-year anniversary draws protests,"" an irate reader left a profanity-riddled voicemail that unkindly insinuated what substance could be found between the ears of Phil Bronstein, then the editor of The Chronicle. (The same reader was even more offended by the appearance of ""pilotless drone"" in the newspaper, and his recorded rant became something of a Web sensation.)



The New York Times, too, is hardly immune to this redundancy. The June 28 edition, for instance, featured an article on Dylan Ratigan's ""one-year anniversary at MSNBC"" and another stating that New York's first gay pride parade commemorated ""the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall uprising."" Philip Corbett, the newsroom's style guru, has frequently complained about this usage in his ""After Deadline"" blog but laments that his reminders have ""little effect.""



What has happened to the word anniversary? Even though the idea of yearly recurrence is built into the word etymologically, that idea has been clouded over centuries of use. And when an element of a word's meaning becomes more opaque, redundancy is one method, however inelegant, that gets used to unmuddy the waters.

As the annual aspect has moved to the background of anniversary, the shift has opened the door for use of the term to mark the passing of shorter units of time. The 11th edition of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, in its entry for the word, states that anniversary can refer more broadly to a date following a notable event ""by a specified period of time measured in units other than years,"" giving the example, ""the 6-month anniversary of the accident.""



Linguists call this process ""semantic bleaching"": the lessening of a word's force through generalization. The bleaching of anniversary has been going on for quite a while, even if dictionaries are only now catching up. For more than a century, English speakers have been modifying anniversary with numbers of days, weeks or months. An article in the May 5, 1901, Atlanta Constitution described the Vanderbilt family's Biltmore mansion in North Carolina, where little Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt ""celebrated the three-months anniversary of her birth by planting out a tree on the estate."" A few years later, The San Jose Evening News reported on the unseemly nature of a widow marrying on ""the third-month anniversary of her husband's death.""



Anniversary has been pressed into service for nonannual commemorations in part because English has no other commonly used terms that can fill the gap. At various times since the 19th century, the monthly equivalent of anniversary has been dubbed a mensiversary, using the Latin root mensis for ""month,"" but this ad-hoc coinage has never caught on. (Members of the Facebook group ""Make 'Mensiversary' a Word"" continue to fight the good fight.) A more recent suggestion is the clunky English-Latin hybrid monthiversary.



With pressure on anniversary to expand its reach to subannual units, it's no wonder that ""nth anniversary"" can somehow feel insufficient for traditional yearly celebrations, in need of the more explicit form, ""n-year anniversary."" But if you don't want to see the meaning of the word weakened any further, stick to the ""nth"" version and trust that others will have the good sense to discern anniversary's annualness.",[]
npr.org,,Warning: This Post Contains Language That May Offend; Such Words Should Not Be Used In Podcasts Or On The Air,[],"Warning: This Post Contains Language That May Offend; Such Words Should Not Be Used In Podcasts Or On The Air

There was a good discussion this week among correspondents and editors in the New York bureau about whether we can use some offensive language in podcasts that we cant on the air.

The immediate question was this (NOTE: sensitive readers may find the next sentence objectionable):

Can we call an asshole an asshole?

The answer was no, we dont want an NPR correspondent to say that on a podcast.

The process, by the way, worked. A correspondent consulted his editor. The editor consulted his boss and the Standards & Practices noodge. A case was made, consideration was given and a decision was reached that everyone understood.

This is a good time to ask: How do we feel about offensive language in podcasts?

As an organization, we respect our audience and set a high bar on use of language that may be offensive.

That line was originally written about what we say on the air, but we made clear three years ago when the Ethics Handbook was published that the bar applies to our other platforms as well:

Online, if sound or text containing potentially offensive language has been approved for use by a Managing Editor or someone above that level, it too must be preceded by text (and in the case of audio, a verbal warning as well) advising the NPR.org audience that what follows contains language some may find offensive.

The environment is changing quickly. Some very popular podcasts do not worry about whether their language might offend. Their hosts conversational and sometimes profane ways of speaking are probably pulling in far more listeners than they repel.

We dont want to seem boring and out-of-step. We do want to sound like America. But, the bar that NPR journalists need to get over before using such language themselves has to be set incredibly high  so high, in fact, that its almost impossible to get over.

Were professional communicators at a major news organization. What we say and write in public reflects on NPR. No matter what platform were using or where were appearing, we should live up to our own standards. Yes, theres more room in podcasts to let guests speak freely and for our journalists to be looser with their language. But it doesnt mean NPR correspondents are free to use words or phrases in podcasts that they would never use on the air.

We should always be the news outlet that revels in language. There are so many wonderful words. Use them!

The most common offensive words and phrases are among the least creative ways of expressing yourself. Theyre akin to cliches in the sense that theyre easy ways out. We pride ourselves on using words that pop out because theyre funny, provocative, rarely heard or just perfect. Again, use them!

You may be asking: Who needs to sign off on what is permissible language in a podcast, what does and does not need to be bleeped and what kind of warnings need to be given to listeners? The people to consult are: the deputy managing editors (Chuck Holmes & Gerry Holmes) and the standards & practices editor (Mark Memmott).

Our panelists predict what the GOP will try next to bring down Donald Trump.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Now panel, how will the GOP next try to take down the Donald? Adam Burke.

ADAM BURKE: They're going to kidnap him and replace him with an imposter. The plan isn't going to work when the surrogate too closely resembles a human being.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Roxanne Roberts.

ROXANNE ROBERTS: In a genius move, the GOP will nominate a true man of the people, someone born in America, a man beloved by everybody, especially Chris Christie. I speak, of course, of Bruce Springsteen.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Bobcat Goldthwait.

BOBCAT GOLDTHWAIT: They're going to replace his self-tanner with barbecue sauce...

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: ...And wait for him to stand dangerously close to Chris Christie.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

BILL KURTIS: Well, panel, if any of that happens, we're going to ask you about it on WAIT WAIT... DONT TELL ME.

SAGAL: Thank you, Bill Kurtis. Thanks also to Adam Burke, Roxanne Roberts and Bobcat Goldthwait. Thanks to all of you for listening. I appreciate it, glad you did. We'll see you next from New York City.

Most people remember the first time they fall in love. In this excerpt from ""Modern Love: The Podcast,"" the author writes about the actual fall that marked her first love.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Now for a story about falling in love, and not just figuratively. In 2012, Natalie Lindeman went on a first date and she fell a hundred feet down a mountainside into a canyon. Lindeman wrote about her date, that fall and what happened next in an essay for the popular New York Times Sunday column ""Modern Love."" Now, NPR member station WBUR and The New York Times have collaborated to produce ""Modern Love: The Podcast,"" which turns those columns into an experience for the ear.

Here, actor Dakota Fanning reads Natalie Lindeman's essay, ""The Plunge.""

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DAKOTA FANNING: (Reading) Last summer, I fell 100 feet into one of the steepest canyons in the United States. After tumbling 75 feet down the near-vertical canyon side, I dropped another 25 feet in freefall, landing in a dry stream bed between granite boulders.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) I have always loved falling. When I was 3, my favorite game was mantle jumping. My dad would place me on the mantle, steady me and step back. I'd push off and fall for that perfect rush of a second before he caught me, swinging me to the ground. In high school, I found a teenage version of mantle jumping by leaping off high, rocky cliffs with my friends into the ocean below. I loved the way the wind whistled in my ears, making me feel so alive. Yet if I was passionate about adventure, I was cautious about passion. A boyfriend would only slow me down.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) Then near the end of my junior year of high school, a senior named Wilder asked me to prom, and I said yes. Right after I said yes though, my heart started pounding and I raced into an empty classroom to breathe for a minute alone. The smile on my face was so big it hurt. I was determined to keep things casual as we headed out on our first real date.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) To escape the early summer heat, we decided to hike the sage-lined trail to the waterfall in Eaton Canyon. Dozens of hikers were already splashing in the pool when college-age hiker asked if we had heard of the second waterfall only a mile beyond. Although the path was unmarked, we tramped another 20 minutes up the steep incline and found it, beautiful and isolated. It was so easy to be with him. We were coming around a curve in the canyon wall, hurrying to get back while it was still light. Wilder went first, searching for notches and footholds, finally making it around. Then I went, feeling for handholds, my face inches from the rock. I traced to where he had grasped, reaching back with my left foot, searching for the ledge. And suddenly, I wasn't holding onto anything. Sandy grit was skittering down the mountain alongside me. I was falling.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) I woke up to the sound of helicopter blades. A cable carried me into the air. It struck me; I had just fallen, and now they were taking me up even higher. My dad found me in the too-bright emergency room and tried to hold my hands, but they were a bloody mess like the rest of me. Wilder's in the waiting room, he said. Nurses cut away my clothes with giant scissors and wiped the dirt and blood from my body. I heard scattered phrases - 100 feet, fractured vertebrae, a miracle. Wilder visited as soon as he was allowed. You're off the hook, I said. What do you mean, he asked? I explained in my drugged speech that he didn't have to come to the hospital or hang out with a broken girl all summer. No guilt. I'd call him when I was healed and back to normal. He stayed with me until a nurse kicked him out.

Five days later, I was home. Doctors said I would have to wear a corset-like brace from my hips to my neck for eight to 12 weeks, and then we could talk about recuperation. Sitting up for 20 minutes exhausted me, and I could barely move without wincing in pain.

Wilder kept visiting, and it scared the hell out of me. I fought to look like the girl he had asked to prom. I looked as if I had been mauled by a tiger, but the brace covered most of it. I'd laugh, roll out of bed and walk around as if keeping in constant motion would prove I was strong, independent and unhurt. I figured he'd leave while I slept, but I'd doze off listening to him playing basketball with my little brother and when I'd wake up, he'd be eating dinner with my family.

Sometimes I think my body saved itself that day by learning to surrender, that those years of falling prepared me to relax into the 100-foot plunge. But it was weeks after the fall before I could truly let go. I thought I could use my injuries as an excuse to push Wilder away. I thought I could forget the look on his face as I fell and ignore the terrified feeling of longing in my chest. But I couldn't. Maybe it was the way he said, I'd rather spend my summer with you than any other girl. Maybe it was how being around him made me forget the brace and the wounds, made me feel whole and unbroken. Finally, surrender became not just inevitable but exhilarating. I didn't want to hold onto anything anymore. I wanted to fall, and I already had. And I knew that this time, too, I would be OK.

MARTIN: That was Dakota Fanning reading Natalie Lindeman's essay, ""The Plunge,"" for WBUR and The New York Times's ""Modern Love: The Podcast.""

npr.org,2016-03-09 00:00:00,New Guidelines Help Protect Unborn Babies Of Pregnant Women With Malaria,[],"Studies Reinforce The Urgency Of Treating Pregnant Women With Malaria

i toggle caption Karen Kasmauski/Corbis Karen Kasmauski/Corbis

The world is focused on finding a link between pregnant women infected with the Zika virus and severe birth defects. But two studies and an editorial in this week's New England Journal of Medicine are reminders that malaria, a disease that killed about half a million people in 2015, also has profound consequences for pregnant women and their infants. The new studies provide much-needed guidance on how to prevent and treat malaria during pregnancy.

""Malaria during pregnancy is a major public health concern,"" says Dr. Joel Tarning, Head of Clinical Pharmacology at Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand, and author of the NEJM editorial ""Treatment of Malaria in Pregnancy.""

Recommended treatment for malaria is artemisinin combination therapy, or ACT, a mix of drugs shown to effectively treat the disease. But until now, the treatment has not been tested on women expecting babies.

""Pregnant women are often excluded from clinical trials, which hampers the implementation of these drug treatments,"" says Tarning.

If malaria is left untreated during pregnancy, infected red blood cells gather in the placenta and block the crucial exchange of nutrients from mother to fetus. The result can be miscarriage, stillbirth and low birth weight, says Tarning.

In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria during pregnancy is thought to be responsible for 20 percent of low birth weight babies each year, leading to 100,000 infant deaths, according to a recent NEJM study.

In Africa many people are immune from malaria and show no symptoms when infected, but pregnancy reduces a woman's immunity. Even when an infected woman has no symptoms, the disease can still harm the fetus, again resulting in low birth weight, miscarriage or stillbirth.

Despite a lack of clinical trial evidence on how to safely and effectively prevent and treat malaria during pregnancy, the consequences of no treatment are severe.

""Not treating pregnant women with malaria is not an option, since this is a life-threatening disease,"" says Tarning.

So the current WHO recommendations are that women living in areas where malaria is prevalent sleep under pesticide-treated nets; that women be given two doses of malaria prevention drugs during their pregnancy; and that women with malaria be treated during the second and third trimester.

Those WHO guidelines on treating malaria in pregnant women haven't changed, but now, with good evidence that they are safe and effective, health ministries can be more confident in carrying them out.

""I hope that these studies provide the needed evidence for countries to use ACTs in the treatment of pregnant women with malaria,"" says Tarning.

And they provide support for being treated earlier in pregnancy. Tarning pointed out a new study in The Lancet Infectious Diseases that treatment with ACTs is safe and effective during the first trimester. ""It's time to reconsider first-trimester anti-malarial treatment recommendations,"" he says.

Just as important, he says, the studies show that in countries where many pregnant women are infected with malaria but show no symptoms because of built-up immunity, treatment with ACTs will benefit them and their unborn babies. ""Hopefully, this will start the debate on using ACTs as preventive treatment in this group,"" he says.

Now there is clear guidance on how malaria drugs affect pregnant women. In another study, 3,428 pregnant women with malaria from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Malawi and Zambia were treated with four different anti-malaria drug combinations. Cure rates ranged from 95 percent to 99.2 percent, with few side effects. And the study on preventive treatment in 300 pregnant women with no malaria symptoms found that the drug combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, one of the combination drugs, prevented the disease and raised no safety concerns.

These studies on malaria's effect on pregnant women, a group previously not studied adequately in clinical trials, should go a long way in protecting mothers and babies from the harmful consequences of the disease.",[]

I'll Take You There: R&B From NPR Music Loading... I'll Take You There: R&B From NPR Music

""I'll Take You There"" is a 24/7 R&B and soul channel from NPR Music. Curated and hosted by Jason King of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University, the playlist runs the gamut from the genre's origins in the 1940s to today's slow jam stunners. You can follow the program on Twitter at @NPRandB and Jason King's personal Twitter account at @jasonkingsays.

Rhythm and blues is a feeling. Rhythm and blues is about getting up to get down to get on the good foot to get happy and enjoy yourself when the suffering hits, when the blues wants to envelop you like a fog.

In the 1940s, R&B was the marketing term journalist-turned-Atlantic Records-producer Jerry Wexler coined to describe the raucous and jumpy sounds African-Americans were concocting in urban hotspots like New Orleans; it was a newfangled phrase to lift black music from the racist connotation of ""race music."" Rhythm and blues was '40s shouters like Wynonie Harris hollering over tight, post-swing rhythm combos  it was three-dimensional bass lines bouncing around driving beats and spastic saxophones honking like farm pigs.

By the '50s, white folks repackaged the music as rock 'n' roll, but it wasn't long before R&B sprouted new arms, extending itself into the gospelized frenzy of soul, the stairstep harmonies of doo-wop, the cool crossover pop of Motown, the hot circular grooves of funk in the '60s, the boudoir hush of quiet storm and the aspirational sleekness of disco in the '70s. But R&B also left its trace on Jamaican reggae, Nigerian afrobeat, Ghanaian highlife, Chicago and Detroit house, not to mention '80s boogie, synth-funk and hi-NRG, and all those British post-Northern-soul variants. Contrary to popular wisdom, the rise of drum machines and samplers in the '80s and '90s never killed R&B: the music only mutated, reformed, transmogrified and got itself a brand new bag in the form of new jack swing, hip-hop-soul, neo-soul, broken beat and drum 'n' bass. The energy never dies.

At its best, R&B remains a morally and spiritually resonant music about love and intimacy, about carnal pleasure, about unrequited dreams, about girls knocking out boys in outstanding ways.

What links R&B across all that space and time is its emphasis on dance, sex and romance. At its best, R&B remains a morally and spiritually resonant music about love and intimacy, about carnal pleasure, about unrequited dreams, about girls knocking out boys in outstanding ways. It's about being overjoyed and underpaid and living for the weekend and turning your house into a home. It's the music of picket lines and picket signs, of sin and salvation, of hustles, twists and Soul Trains. It's the soundtrack of cities being burned by riots, of communities struggling to be free, of people darker than blue saying it loud and proud to be right on and free. It's the music of corner bars and shabeens and dancehalls and supermarkets and bathhouses and weddings and barbecues and family reunions. It's happy feelings and silent tears, hot grits and raining men, tempestuous telephone calls and profound pillow talk. It's feel-deep music, vibration and frequency meant to resonate in the marrow of your bones and the cells of your blood.

I've curated a 24/7 stream of thousands of songs for NPR that reflect the vast range of what R&B was and what it is and where it's going. You're likely to hear anything from Aretha Franklin to Little Richard to Sylvester to Jodeci to Ruth Brown to IG Culture to Carl Hall to Disclosure to Dinah Washingtonto Roy Ayers to Kelela to The Righteous Brothers to Jorge Ben to Amos Milburn to Jeff Buckley to Louis Jordan. It's all elemental  earth, fire, water and wind music for the body, spirit and mind.",[]

Alex Abramovich was in his 30s when he looked up a guy who had bullied him in grade school. In his new memoir, Abramovich writes about reconnecting with Trevor, now the head of a motorcycle club.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. You've probably had the experience of reconnecting with a childhood friend and being surprised at the direction your friend's life has taken and perhaps discovering that you each have different memories of that childhood friendship. Our guest, writer Alex Abramovich, was in his 30s when he looked up a guy who'd bullied him in grade school, and he found his old tormentor, Trevor, was still using his fists. He headed a motorcycle club in Oakland, called the East Bay Rats, which had a reputation for boozing and brawling. The Rats regularly held neighborhood fistfights at a boxing ring behind their clubhouse, events they promoted with sweatshirts that read, East Bay Fight Night, Support Consensual Bloodshed. Abramovich wrote a magazine piece about the East Bay Rats then moved to Oakland for four years, where he spent so much time with the club that members like to say that he'd embedded with them. His new memoir is about the biker subculture, the struggling city of Oakland and his reflections on the violence in the East Bay Rats' lives and his own. It's called ""Bullies: A Friendship."" He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies.

DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Alex Abramovich, welcome to FRESH AIR. Tell us about your memories of Trevor Latham as a child.

ALEX ABRAMOVICH: I remember Trevor as a large, menacing, angry boy, which is funny because when I went back and met him years later and saw photos of him, it turned out that he was a little boy - we were both pretty little kids - and he only had his growth spurt years after I'd initially met him. But I remembered him as just this malevolent force in my life.

DAVIES: When you were how old?

ABRAMOVICH: I would've been 7 years old, and this was in the fourth grade and my dad and I had just moved to a new town. I'd only moved in with my dad the previous year. My mom had died that year so I'd moved in with my father. And then my dad lost his job almost immediately so we moved from Massachusetts in with my grandma in Brooklyn, and then towards the end of that year, we moved to Long Island, which is where I met Trevor. And I was only in that school for two years, but in my memory he loomed as this sort of - the archetypal bully. He was the bully I remembered out of all the bullies I'd known.

DAVIES: So you were classmates. Would he, like, wait for you after school or - what kinds of - if you remember, what kinds of encounters were they?

ABRAMOVICH: Well, our memories are different. My memories diverge from Trevor's. My memory is of Trevor, you know, being the sort of kid that would meet you at the schoolhouse door and threaten to meet you back there at the end of the school day and threaten to beat me up, threaten to kill me. And the way I remember it, he did meet me at the schoolhouse door at the end of the day and he did beat me up, and I remember rolling around on the ground with him tussling, kicking, biting - a lot of fear.

DAVIES: And, if you remember, why was he bullying you? Do you recall having a sense of what motivated him?

ABRAMOVICH: At the time, I had no idea. At the time, I was just this confused, scared kid and here was this force of nature that I suddenly encountered and couldn't quite get around. So I was beyond thinking of motivations at that point. I was just - you know, I was just a mess.

DAVIES: So a lot of time goes by and you reconnect. How did that happen?

ABRAMOVICH: You know how people you met before the Internet existed, you sort of never think to Google them?

DAVIES: Right.

ABRAMOVICH: It was that sort of thing with Trevor. I remembered him and I remembered his name, but I'd never thought to Google him until one day I did. And a very short thing came up on the screen that said, I moved to California, became a bouncer and started a motorcycle club. So I knew at that point that we were - we would meet again. That was too good to pass up.

DAVIES: So you connect and you go out to Oakland. And when you saw him for the first time as an adult, what did he look like?

ABRAMOVICH: He looked like a whale walking upright. He's a massive guy, shaved head, goatee, Roman nose. Just big, big. All of those guys are big, all of the guys in his club. And he was surrounded by the guys in his club the first time I saw him, but even then he stood out. And he looked nothing at all like the boy I'd known, but somehow I knew him immediately. I recognized him, I knew exactly which one he was. And the first time I saw him, he had a - it was in a bar, and he was a bouncer at the bar and he had a guy backed up against the wall and was holding him by the scruff of his shirt so he looked extra menacing.

DAVIES: Did you connect right away? I mean, what - how did he react to your getting in touch?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor's club is the East Bay Rats, that's his motorcycle club, and they have a website - a very bare-bones, old-fashioned website, but Trevor's number is on it. It was a 510 number, and I dialed it, and he was at the bar when I called him. And I said, you don't know me but I used to know you in grade school. We used to know each other in grade school. And, without missing a beat, he said, Alex Abramovich? It was very strange. And we started emailing - texting, but mostly emailing. It was really before texting - late at night, and sort of comparing memories, which turned out to be very different, his and mine. So there was a basis for communication by the time I got out to Oakland, and we got along well. We sat at his bar and - he stopped bouncing - sat down at the bar, and we drank whiskey and then we were drunk. So that's how that first meeting went.

DAVIES: And you hadn't seen each other since the fourth grade, but you clearly remembered him. You'd spoken to your friends about him. So the bullying really left an impression on you. When you reconnected as adults, what was his memory of your relationship as kids?

ABRAMOVICH: Well, I remembered him in part, I think - in retrospect, it seems to me that I remembered him because Trevor Latham is such a strong, good name for a bully. The way he remembered it - it's interesting, in the specific details of what we did - our fights, our memories - pretty much aligned. He remembers fighting, he remembers fighting in the classroom, teachers breaking us up. He remembers us getting sent down to the principal's office. He remembered our fathers having to pick us up at school - much more specific memories than I had, actually. But, weirdly enough, he also remembers that I was bullying him as much as he was bullying me, and, moreover, he remembers that despite that we were good friends at the time. He remembers us playing chess, going to each other's houses. I don't remember any of this. Didn't then, don't now.

DAVIES: And with the light of all of the experience, what's your best guess as to who's right?

ABRAMOVICH: I think in way we're both right. You know, I was an angry, messed-up kid and I'm sure that there were times when I was the aggressor, especially if this was an ongoing, you know, broken relationship between us. But what's also interesting about it is that our - the specific details of our memories line up, but that makes me think that Trevor's a bully, whereas it leads him to think that because we were fighting all the time that meant we must've been friends.

DAVIES: Wow. So he saw - he saw somebody he fought with all the time as a friend.

ABRAMOVICH: Well, not only that, but he grew up to be friends with people he fought with all the time, professionally.

DAVIES: Right, which we're going to get to. But before that, tell me a little about your family and his family when you were kids.

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. Trevor comes from a very, very old family in Long Island, the Lathams, and if you go out to the very northernmost tip of Long Island to Orient, the town called Orient, you'll see the name everywhere on farm stands, hardware stores - it's Latham, Latham, Latham. So his family had been on Long Island forever, and they became very successful. They were lawyers and architects, and there was money. And Trevor's father grew up on an estate on the North Shore in these sort of Gatsby-esque surroundings, but by the time I knew Trevor, the money was sort of gone. His family had split up. His mother and sisters had moved to California so it was just Trevor and Trevor's dad - who was unemployed at the time - sort of stuck in that house.

DAVIES: And do you know what kind of relationship he had with his dad?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor describes his father as being a very angry individual. I think there was a lot of rage. There were holes in the sheetrock where his dad had punched through them. What Trevor told me when I met him was, my father didn't really hit me but the threat was always there, and the threat was more frightening than actually being hit because when anything is possible all the time, sort of all bets are off.

DAVIES: And what was your childhood like with your dad after your mom died?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, my family immigrated to America in 1976 so we didn't really know anyone in the country. And my parents split up about six months after we got here so my mom and I went to live in Pittsburgh and my dad went to live in New York. And he'd visit and I'd see him. We were close, but physically, we were removed by hundreds of miles. And then when my mom got too sick to take care of me, I stayed with a series of family friends. So by the time I went to live with my dad, there'd been a series of sort of dislocations for me, and I think I was already a pretty messed up and somewhat out-of-control kid and a lot for my father to handle. My father - who would've been younger than I am now, I think - all of a sudden is saddled with this damaged, you know, semi-feral child, which was what I was at that time, and I think it was overwhelming for him in some ways. I know I was a lot to handle. And then on top of that, they weren't the best economic times and we had no family in the country, we had no economic safety net. We didn't really know our neighbors so it was very isolating, and all the more isolating because we kept moving. I think by the time I started fourth grade, I had been to eight or nine schools - something like that. So it was hard at home. I think Trevor in some ways had it harder than me, but there were certainly points at which I could relate to his story when I met him.

DAVIES: Well, you go out to Oakland, you connect with Trevor, and he is the head of the East Bay Rats motorcycle club. There are lots of different kinds of motorcycle clubs, you know, some more benign than others. Give us your early impressions of the East Bay Rats.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah, I mean, I think most people picture, you know, ""Sons Of Anarchy,"" let's say, when they picture a motorcycle club, and there's a grain of truth to that depiction, although there's a lot that actual bikers would quibble with. The Rats sort of ride the line between presenting as a criminal organization, but they're not really criminals. They're more - they're miscreants and they're hooligans, but there are no real criminal enterprises. That said, there are a lot of them. There are about 35 at any given time. It's about the size of an Army platoon. They're big. They're not conflict-averse. And they're intimidating, they're in uniform. They're wearing motorcycle leathers, they're wearing armor, they're wearing helmets, they're wearing basically the best gear you could possibly wear in a street fight. And they know what they look like - they're very self-aware - so they're very good at gauging how intimidating they're being or presenting at any given moment.

DAVIES: Describe the clubhouse.

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. The clubhouse is an old barbershop on San Pablo Avenue, which was the oldest street in the East Bay, it used to be the Camino Real. And the clubhouse was - it was always sort of a clubhouse. It was a barbershop. It was an African-American barbershop. So it was always sort of a meeting place. In 2006, the first time I saw it, there was a speak-easy bar next door. That bar, I found out, used to be Huey Newton's speak-easy when he was on that stretch of San Pablo. So it was always this community center, that block, but that said, it had fallen on very tough times indeed. There were a lot of homeless people, there were a lot of recyclers pushing shopping carts, a lot of drugs. There was a lot of violence. So, you know, there'd be bloodstains on the sidewalk and - and the clubhouse itself was about the size of a barbershop with a backyard. And it was a concrete floor, sheetrock walls, boxing equipment wherever you looked. There was a bar that Trevor had installed stripper poles on and women would get up there during parties they threw. And, in the back, there was a barbecue pit and Trevor's old truck, and it was an old Ford Bronco that he'd painted flat black, and a boxing - well, the first time I saw it, there was no boxing ring. There were couches arranged in a square, and that's what served as a boxing ring. Later on, they got an actual boxing ring and put it in back there.

DAVIES: You said that these guys are not conflict averse, which is a nice way of saying they seem to love to mix it up. And there's a section that I'd like you to read here where you're talking about one of the club's members, a guy named John Firpo (ph), and his interaction with a stranger who had said the wrong thing. Do you want to read this for us?

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. (Reading) John Firpo had George Bellows' painting tattooed on his torso. Now I watched him punch the stranger who'd said the wrong thing. A single blow was all that it took to put the man on the concrete. This was a thing the Rats did, for the bored and unstable, for masochists or men who are eager to show off and prove themselves in some dumb way. There was no shame in getting beaten up by one of the Rats. Anyone could walk into the clubhouse, tell one of them off. They'd kick your [expletive] immediately without getting mad or taking things personally.

They were not conflict averse. They wouldn't even gang up on you necessarily. Beat downs were like a community service the Rats provided. The stranger didn't take his personally. He got back on his feet and apologized, told Firpo that his mom had just died, that he'd been messed up, at his wits end and had not meant to say anything all. Now that he had, he was sorry. I'm sorry about your mother, said Firpo as he guided the man out of the clubhouse.

DAVIES: (Laughter) That's a - this is a remarkable scene, and it's almost as if these guys use violence the way others use language, isn't it?

ABRAMOVICH: That's a beautiful way of putting it. Yeah, it's a form of communication and it's also a form of exchanging affections.

DAVIES: Alex Abramovich is our guest. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, our guest is writer Alex Abramovich. His new book, ""Bullies: A Friendship,"" is about a friendship that he renewed with a kid he'd known from his youth who turns out to have founded a motorcycle club in Oakland. Alex Abramovich spent a lot of time there.

Now, the club, as we read your book, seems less about riding bikes than about fighting. And Trevor organized fight nights at which the public would be invited and he would have people in the boxing ring out back. Initially you say it was just a bunch of couches arranged in a square, but eventually there was a boxing ring. Do you want to describe one of these events for us?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, they sound different than they are to attend. They're fun in real life, although they're bloody and violent. And sometimes they were impromptu. Sometimes people - fights would just break out. But sometimes they were very organized and they would have themes. There was, in fact, the Jews versus Gentiles fight night, which would be a two-man versus two-man fight, so a four-man fight. And it would be over bragging rights for who could name the next holiday party. Would it be a Christmas party or would it be a Hanukkah party. And it was billed as the battle of the sects.

DAVIES: The battle of the sects, OK, S-E-C-T, OK.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. So fliers went out all over town. And there was a series of undercards, so a lot of other people fought before the Jews and the Gentiles got into the ring. And oddly enough, I didn't know that there were too many Jewish bikers out there. I'd never really run into them in New York, but there are a couple. In the ring, the violence was very contained. And the further away you went from the ring, the more violent things got. And sort of once you slipped into the shadows, you'd start seeing really nasty things happening. So at the time that the Jews and the Gentiles are fighting in the ring in the back, out front on San Pablo Avenue some recyclers are maybe getting beaten up for instance.

DAVIES: Recyclers - these are, like, guys who pick up cans to get, you know, food for their habits or whatever, right?

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. I mean, there's a recycling center that's a few blocks from the clubhouse. And it's a source of constant tension in the neighborhood because not only are the recyclers with their shopping carts always clogging up San Pablo Avenue, but there are problems having to do with people's houses getting broken into, tools getting stolen, pipes getting stolen. In fact, the East Bay Rats' clubhouse was broken into while I was there and Trevor's plumbing was stolen.

And then there are also issues having to do with public urination, public defecation, prostitution, drug dealing. And remarkably enough, some of the recyclers seem to think that if they'd break their bags full of bottles - they're sold by weight. So they think that if they break their bags full of bottles they'll weigh more because broken glass weighs more than intact bottles. So there's this constant soundtrack of breaking glass.

DAVIES: You describe an incident that you witnessed between some members of the motorcycle club, the East Bay Rats, and a recycler. You want to tell us about that?

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. So the recyclers are kind of a constant presence and when the Rats drink beer, which they do all the time and in fact there's a soda machine that sells dollar beers in the clubhouse, they'll just toss the empties outside and the empties will be gone within 30 seconds or a minute. And that's their form of recycling.

So at the night of one of the fight nights, there was a recycler who kept hovering right around the door. And usually what'll happen at a fight night or an East Bay Rats party is all of the Rats and people belonging to other clubs will ride up to the clubhouse and park their bikes in a neat line down the length of the block. So it makes for quite a visual. And on one night, I saw there was a recycler who kept darting in in between their legs right outside the clubhouse front door to get the cans, basically, to get empty beer cans.

And, you know, there are often people hanging around the Rats who want to impress them, who want to be prospects for the club. And someone like that was around that evening. And he got up at one point, got up off the motorcycle he was sitting on, walked over to the recycler and shoved him hard into the line of bikes. And, you know, I was holding my breath, and for a minute I thought it was going to be OK, but it wasn't OK. Another Rat came up and touching the bike was enough it turned out. Everyone was drunk and a Rat went up and he knocked the man down to the ground. And then a couple of other Rats came out and they knocked the man to the ground. And San Pablo is a wide avenue. It's four lanes with a big median strip. And the man crawled over - the recycler crawled over the median strip and - onto the oncoming traffic lane. And I turned and I saw one of the Rats flip the visor on his helmet down and he was on his motorcycle and he rode it around the median strip. And he rode it up to the recycler who was lying on the ground at this point bleeding. And he rolled his bike back and forth sort of nudging the recycler a few times with the front tire. And then he gunned it and he rode over the recycler's torso, which was very horrible to watch and horrible to think about and horrible also to think that I could've done something to stop it in real time. And I didn't realize that in real time and didn't do anything to stop it, so not a proud moment for me.

DAVIES: And the recycler survived, got up and walked away?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I turned around and I thought I was going to throw up when I saw them ride over the recycler's body. And when I turned back around, the recycler was gone. I was expecting him to be lying on the cement with broken bones, but he had scampered away. The next time I saw Trevor, Trevor said, you'd be surprised. Crack heads are surprisingly resilient, and I said I wish I could've done something to stop it, and Trevor said you could've. All it takes is someone saying stop.

GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Alex Abramovich about his new book, ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll hear more of the interview after a break. And we'll remember The Beatles' record producer George Martin, who died yesterday at age 90. We'll listen back to an interview I recorded with him about helping shape their early sound and about producing ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Alex Abramovich about his new memoir, ""Bullies: A Friendship."" It's about reconnecting with a guy who'd bullied him when they were kids. When they reconnected, that guy, Trevor, was the head of a motorcycle club in East Oakland called the East Bay Rats, which was known for their bruising and brawling. The book is in part about that subculture.

DAVIES: What was the East Bay Rats' attitude towards racial diversity? I mean, there's - it's a city with a history of some racial issues certainly.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. I didn't know this before I started writing the book, but it turns out that many motorcycle clubs are formed along racial lines. I mean, they form along all sorts of lines. They form along - the police themselves in Oakland have a motorcycle club. In fact, there are two motorcycle clubs associated with the police out there. But well-known national clubs tend to break down along racial lines, and the Rats do not. There are African-American members. There are Jewish members, as I mentioned. There are Mexican-American members. So for the Rats, that's never really been an issue. It's very inclusive in that way. And it's also inclusive sexually I would say. Gays and lesbians are always welcome in the clubhouse. They're welcome in the - at fight nights. It's an interesting question what would happen if an openly gay man were to try to join the Rats. I'm not sure how that would fly. But in terms of people they hang out with, it's absolutely copacetic. So in that sense, the Rats are not - I would say that the Rats are more evolved in certain ways than our present political moment.

DAVIES: And what about their attitude towards women? You know, you hear of motorcycle clubs having women with - wearing things saying that they're the club's property.

ABRAMOVICH: I mean, they're not models of enlightened 21st-century, you know, men. And the gender roles are - tend to be a little old-fashioned maybe by standards employed elsewhere in the Bay Area. There are a couple of young women who hung out with the Rats. Bea (ph) and an Amber (ph) are their names, and they made themselves patches that read East Bay Cats (ph). So they were sort of like the girls auxiliary. But that's not quite the same as saying property of. On the other hand, it's certainly true - and I saw this time and again - that the Rats are both incredibly attractive for and aware of their own attractiveness to certain kinds of women in Oakland. And they take full advantage of that. And the full advantage of that might involve orgies in the back of the bar or the clubhouse. I don't think they really do this anymore. You know, they've aged out of it and they're family men now, but there was a lot of stuff going on in relation to girls.

DAVIES: Were there any stories of rape or sexual abuse of women in the club?

ABRAMOVICH: No. I never heard anything remotely about a rape and I think that I would've. I spent four years with those guys and I spent a lot of that time with people who didn't like those guys, so I would've heard about it. I heard a lot of messed up sexual stories, but nothing that wasn't consensual.

The one thing that happened while I was out there was that at one of the fight nights there was a man that assaulted a young woman. And they were making out and he started choking her and then she was on the ground and then she ran into the clubhouse covered in blood. And she said that this guy had tried to rape her and the Rats came down immediately like avenging angels, and they beat that guy to within an inch of his life. And Trevor said that as I was hitting him I was really sad because I really like this guy but here he was, you know, but then he also felt sad that he didn't break the guy's legs with a shovel.

DAVIES: Because there was a code of some kind.

ABRAMOVICH: The code is - there are rules. They're written down. I wasn't allowed to see them. Prospects aren't even allowed to see them. You're only allowed to see them once you patch in as a member. But I know what some of the rules are, and there are rules governing the treatment of women and the word respect comes up very often. So not only do you not disrespect women when they're around you but you especially respect each other's girlfriends. You have to ask permission before you date someone's ex-girlfriend. As you would imagine, this leads to a certain amount of friction.

DAVIES: You spent some time with the motorcycle club the East Bay Rats when you were writing a magazine article. Then you went back to New York and eventually came back to Oakland with your girlfriend and lived there for quite a while. So you had a lot of experience and spent a lot of time with the guys in the club. What did they think of you?

ABRAMOVICH: They didn't know what to make of me. The first time I met them when I was writing the magazine article, Trevor had told everyone that I was his bully, so they couldn't wait to see the guy who had bullied the president of their motorcycle club. And they were surprised when this, you know, 5-foot-8 guy with glasses stepped out of his rental car.

DAVIES: (Laughter).

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor does not wear glasses and he's well over 6 feet tall. And they did what they would do to anyone that they liked initially - they hazed me. And they put me on a motorcycle on my first full day in Oakland, my first morning in Oakland. And they put me on a motorcycle that I was guaranteed to crash, which I did crash. And I crashed it right away and I crashed it badly. I think they expected a smaller crash, but I crashed it in style. And I broke my hand, but weirdly enough, my hand - I don't know if it was the adrenaline or just the way the nerves are arranged, but for whatever reason my hand didn't hurt until I got back to New York. So instead of going to the hospital, I wrapped it up in boxing tape and I stayed out there for a week, and I kept reporting.

So in a sense we sort of got the hazing out of the way very early and I think that I ended up presenting or appearing as a much braver person than I actually am. If my hand had actually been hurting I would've gone to the hospital. But then the magazine article came out six or seven months later and the Rats liked that very much. They're not criminals, so they don't make any money off the club, so the coin for them is publicity. And they're savvy when it comes to publicity, and this was publicity on a grand national scale, so they liked that a lot.

So the magazine article came out, and it brought them a fair amount of welcome attention, including sexual attention, and they like that. So there was a certain amount of goodwill, I would say, built in by the time I arrived back at the club. But it's a club with, you know, as I said, 35 members and some of them like the cameras and some of them don't like the cameras. And that's a dynamic in and of itself, just having a camera changes what's happening at the clubhouse. So there were Rats that didn't like me at all and probably still don't like me and they pretty much stayed away from me. John Firpo, who we mentioned already, took a very active dislike to me. And John Firpo is a very large and very intimidating, scary dude. And that was unpleasant. John and I got along fine now, but...

DAVIES: Well, I was going to - did you feel afraid ever? I mean, you were there for some long nights with a lot of drinking and I'm sure they got really rowdy. Did you feel afraid?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I didn't feel afraid because I was in - I was working. I was there to take notes. I was drinking sometimes, but I was still working. And there was a sort of circle of safety involved when you were with Trevor. So as long as I stayed within that circle of safety, I felt OK. Now, there were things that happened at the periphery that were not OK and that were scary and frightening and genuinely I would say lightweight dangerous.

DAVIES: Alex Abramovich is our guest. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, we're speaking with writer Alex Abramovich. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" It's about him reconnecting with a kid he'd known from his youth who turns out to have founded a motorcycle club in Oakland. Alex Abramovich spent a lot of time there.

You know, it's interesting. There are places in the book where you have long extended stories quoted verbatim from some of the bikers, particularly Trevor. I assume you carried a tape recorder a lot of the time. And he certainly sounds very well spoken. You do say you wondered at points if he was a sociopath. What made you wonder that?

ABRAMOVICH: Things he did. To give two very brief examples - one was a story that he told me. I picked him up one day. We were going somewhere and he said, you know, it's funny. A crackhead was peeing on my door last night and I opened up the door and there he was. And I took a shovel and, you know, I broke the guy's arm. I could tell I'd broken his arm from the way it was flopping around. But then, you know, I walked inside and I turned on the PlayStation and I was playing ""Star Wars Battlefront"" and I got the highest score I've ever gotten. I thought that was a strange story.

DAVIES: Trevor's life did change over time, right? What's he up to now?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor's got a very heteronormative life now. I mean, it was pretty heteronormative before, but now it's a pretty just normative let's say. He lives in Emeryville now, which is a small town next to Oakland. He moved out of Oakland because everyone is getting priced out of Oakland these days, or as Trevor put it, Oakland's getting nicer and that's great, but if it gets too much nicer, we'll all have to leave. So he left.

He got a job doing outdoor work with the city of Albany, which is another small town nearby that has really good schools that he can send his kids to. And Trevor has two little boys now. He got married. He stopped being a bouncer. At some point, he bought himself a purple Harley-Davidson. These guys all ride very fast Japanese sports bikes that they customize and turn into Rat bikes - what they call them. But Trevor bought this, you know, giant thing out of ""Purple Rain"" with a CD player, which he's since gotten rid of. Even that was too much for him. But he's got a - Trevor's very wily and he's sort of set himself up with the life that he wants and on the surface at least it looks pretty much like, you know, this American life.

DAVIES: And is there less violence in his life?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I never saw Trevor - Trevor got into fights while I was there at the bar, but I never saw Trevor inside the ring. I never actually saw him box. He and I sparred together. He taught me how to box, but I never saw him that directly involved in violence. Now he's not a bouncer at the club anymore, so that takes that whole part out of the equation. They still have fight nights, and the club's actually thriving now. It was in a bit of a lull when I was out there.

So on the one hand, he's surrounded by violence, but on the other hand, you know, he's also a father now. And he told me a funny story just this week actually. They were having a fight night and his boy Mason (ph) was there. And Mason's about 2-and-a-half, maybe going on 3 now. And Mason had seen lots of boxing and ultimate fighting on TV and he'd seen people spar at the clubhouse, but he'd never seen an actual fight. And now people are fighting in the boxing ring. And these were people that he knows and loves and cares about and they're hurting each other and they're getting hurt. And Trevor looked down at Mason and he thought, oh, my God, am I one of those parents? What am I exposing my kid to? And before he could do anything, Mesa looked up at his mom and handed her his dinosaurs and ran into the clubhouse. And Trevor - you know, Trevor went after him and he was expecting to find Mason in the corner crying, but instead Trevor said Mason was in there hitting the heavy bag.

DAVIES: Wow (laughter). How well do you feel that you know him? I mean, are you good friends now? Do you feel like you understand him?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, he's my oldest friend, I think. I've known him for 30 - is that right - 35 years now and I'm only 43. And I'm his oldest friend. So in a sense there's a very deep connection and whenever we don't see each other for a while, we pick up the thread very quickly. As far as understanding him, I think my understanding of him is contained in that I can sort of walk around him and describe him. And I think I did a pretty good job of it in the book of describing how he comes across, how his very, very unusual mind works. But in terms of really, really going in there and untangling the motivations, yeah, you know, the short answer is I do think I get it and I think I described it. He functions under tremendous internal pressures and he has absorbed a great deal of poison and he's gotten better and better at with every passing year at lancing that poison and finding productive ways to - or at least non-self-destructive ways to let seep back out into the world.

DAVIES: Well, Alex Abramovich, thanks so much for speaking with us.

ABRAMOVICH: Thanks so much, Dave. It was a pleasure.

GROSS: Alex Abramovich is the author of the new memoir ""Bullies: A Friendship."" He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies, who is also WHYY's senior reporter.

i toggle caption Lydia Thompson/NPR Lydia Thompson/NPR

Bernie Sanders was the story of Tuesday night as he beat Hillary Clinton in Michigan's Democratic presidential primary. It wasn't a walloping  he won by less than 2 points  but still a big coup considering Clinton led in most polls by double digits before the race.

Michigan is Sanders' ninth state win, though Clinton still leads in delegates overall.

That means Sanders is only partway up a steep hill to the nomination.

""I am used to climbing steep hills,"" Sanders told NPR's Ari Shapiro, host of All Things Considered, noting that when he began his campaign he was unknown to most Americans. ""Stay tuned. I think we are going to go further and we have a good chance to pull off the biggest political upset in the modern history of America. We can win this thing.""

As far as the delegate count so far goes, he admits, ""We have not done well in the deep South,"" but adds that ""it's not surprising. The South is a pretty conservative area, I'm not a conservative.""

But he points out the wins he has had in New England, the Midwest and West. Given those, he said, he thinks he has a ""pretty good chance"" to win in New York and an ""excellent chance"" in California, Oregon, Hawaii and smaller states like Montana and Idaho.

However, an NPR analysis found that even if on Tuesday, Sanders wins 55 percent of the delegates in Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, but Clinton wins 60 percent in North Carolina, Sanders would slip further behind, needing 54 percent of all remaining delegates.

After next week, even if Sanders wins four large, non-Southern contests (Wisconsin, Oregon, Washington and California) with 60 percent, he would still need to pick up 51 percent of the delegates from all remaining contests to win a majority of pledged delegates.

And there's another challenge ahead of him. He won Michigan largely thanks to white voters, but has struggled to appeal to African-Americans. He won a larger share of black votes in Michigan than he had been winning, but still not a majority  just around 30 percent.

The real hurdle, he says, is getting his message out to black voters  in a way that Hillary Clinton hasn't already.

""I don't think it's a question of us winning over black voters, I think it is a question of Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton having very strong support in the African-American community,"" he said. ""I congratulate them.""

Sanders also responded to his comment in the last debate that drew ire from some black leaders (""When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto""), emphasizing his track record on poverty.

""There's no candidate who has talked more about poverty in this country than I have. White poverty, black poverty and Latino poverty,"" he said. ""Now it would be nice if every once in a while the media paid attention to those issues, which we don't.""",[]

(Note on Aug. 19, 2015: This guidance has been mostly superseded. Go here to see our new guidance.)

Five months after we issued guidance on how to refer to the group known as the Islamic State, is it time to do away with the rule that listeners and readers be reminded that it is self-declared, self-proclaimed, self-styled or known as?

The consensus from the foreign desk editors is that it is not time to do that.

The reasoning remains the same:

 The words help distinguish the Islamic State from nations, such as the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.

 Not adding the words implies that the organization is a state, when in fact it is not an independent government ... within defined borders. Those are key parts of the words definition.

There is one tweak to the guidance. So-called is not one of the phrases we should rely on. It doesnt convey as much information as self-declared or self-proclaimed, which make clear to listeners and readers where the name came from.

Related note: ISIS remains our style on second reference. If someone we speak with uses ISIL or Daesh, we can again remind the audience that the group is also known by those names. Also, if a show has already introduced the Islamic State in one segment, theres probably no need to go through the self-proclaimed/self-declared/etc. steps again in a subsequent segment.

npr.org,,Please Read The CJR Report About Rolling Stone,[],"Please Read The CJR Report About Rolling Stone

The particulars of Rolling Stones failure make clear the need for a revitalized consensus in newsrooms old and new about what best journalistic practices entail, at an operating-manual-level of detail.

That line from the Columbia Journalism Reviews dissection of Rolling Stones infamous investigation of an alleged gang rape underscores why the CJR report is highly recommended reading. It reminds us that the basics matter  a lot.

CJR concludes that better and clearer policies about reporting practices, pseudonyms and attribution might well have prevented the magazines errors. ... Stronger policy and clearer staff understanding in at least three areas might have changed the final outcome. From the report:

 Pseudonyms. [Editors] said using pseudonyms at Rolling Stone is a case by case issue that requires no special convening or review. Pseudonyms are inherently undesirable in journalism. They introduce fiction and ask readers to trust that this is the only instance in which a publication is inventing details at its discretion. Their use in this case was a crutch  it allowed the magazine to evade coming to terms with reporting gaps. Rolling Stone should consider banning them. If its editors believe pseudonyms are an indispensable tool for its forms of narrative writing, the magazine should consider using them much more rarely and only after robust discussion about alternatives, with dissent encouraged.  Checking Derogatory Information. [The reporter and her editor] made the fateful agreement not to check [a key part of the accuser's story that put three people in an unfavorable light] with the three friends. If the fact-checking department had understood that such a practice was unacceptable, the outcome would almost certainly have changed.  Confronting Subjects With Details. When [the reporter] sought comment, she missed the opportunity to hear challenging, detailed rebuttals from [the fraternity] before publication. The fact-checker relied only on [the reporter's] communications with the fraternity and did not independently confirm with Phi Kappa Psi the account Rolling Stone intended to publish. ... If both the reporter and checker had understood that by policy they should routinely share specific, derogatory details with the subjects of their reporting, Rolling Stone might have veered in a different direction.

Our Ethics Handbook deals with those points. Here is where NPR stands:

 Dont Create Pseudonyms For Sources Whose Names We Withhold. When we decide to withhold a sources name from a story, we dont invent a pseudonym for that source. Again, our job is to present factual  not fabricated  information. Instead, we use pronouns and descriptions to make clear who is speaking or whom were referring to. (Or we may refer to him or her without using a last name, if the source is comfortable with that degree of anonymity, and the situation meets our standards for granting anonymity. ... )  No Attacks. In our coverage, anonymous or unnamed sources generally cannot make pejorative comments about the character, reputation, or personal qualities of another individual, or derogatory statements about an institution. ... [Exceptions are made only after] careful deliberation with senior news managers.  Give Sources Time To Respond. If our audience wonders what someone we report about had to say in his or her defense, and we havent provided that information or explained our efforts to get it, we have failed.  Give Subjects Enough Information To Be Able To Respond Effectively. In 2005, NPR aired a story about the new editor of the Paris Review. Former staffers of the magazine  some of whom had been let go  were heard saying that the new leader was betraying the vision of the Reviews founder, George Plimpton. What was the editors response to that charge? He didnt get the chance to say. Our interview with him was done before the critics were contacted, and the editor wasnt contacted again. NPR subsequently apologized on the air for not giving the editor the chance to answer his critics. As Bill Marimow, then-NPR vice president for news, said: If the subject of the story doesnt know what youre going to report, how can we be fair to them? 

CJRs analysis makes clear that several people are to blame for Rolling Stones failures, starting with the reporter and extending to her editors. So heres another reminder from our handbook:

Edit Like A Prosecutor. Great journalism comes in part from the collaborative efforts of reporters, editors and producers, who all play a key role in ensuring accuracy. We believe in teamwork. But good editors are also good prosecutors. They test, probe and challenge reporters, always with the goal of making NPRs stories as good (and therefore as accurate) as possible.

Attempting to escape Lady Schrapnell's demands and find some bedrest, Ned absconds to 1880s Oxford  where his arrival triggers a sequence of events as hilarious as they are inventive. This beautiful comedy of manners includes a charming homage to Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat, as Ned bumbles his way through boating, dogs, romance, eccentric Oxford dons and dreadful contemporary taste in a desperate search for the fantastical bishop's bird stump.

Sheryl Sandberg. Hillary Clinton. Malala Yousafzai. Oprah. Even Taylor Swift.

These names pop up when you Google ""women changing the world."" Depending on your politics and point of view, you may agree that these influencers have broken stereotypes, raised global awareness for critical issues like energy and education, and/or served as role models for girls.

What about Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy? Etheldreda Nakimuli-Mpungu? Kiran Gandhi? Have you heard of them?

Probably not.

But they deserve a Google shout-out too. They're some of the unsung women making strides in the developing world. In honor of International Women's Day and Women's History Month, here's a collection of some amazing global women that NPR has profiled in just the past few months. Maybe in a few years they'll top Google's lists of women changing the world in ways large and small.

Rosa Coj Bocel, student

Bocel, 27, is the star of a short documentary about her life in rural Guatemala, Rosa  These Storms. The indigenous Mayan woman grew up in poverty, was pulled out of school early, then became pregnant. Her daughter died at the age of 2 from hydrocephalus, a condition marked by a buildup of fluid in the brain. Despite these hardships, Bocel persevered. A few years ago, she graduated from high school and is now studying to be a registered nurse. Her dream is to open a pharmacy in her village.

Dr. Odontuya Davaasuren, doctor and professor

Davaasuren, a family doctor and professor at the Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences in Ulaanbaatar, has one goal: to improve the way people die. Called ""the mother of palliative care"" in her country, she's helped raise more awareness and funding for end-of-life care. Now poor families taking care of a terminally ill person can get about 36,000 tugrik [$18] each month from the government until the patient dies. ""It's very small but still supportive,"" says Davaasuren.

Kiran Gandhi, period activist

Gandhi, 26, a Los Angeles-based musician and feminist, ran the London Marathon while on her period without using any hygiene products. She wanted to let her blood flow freely to encourage women not to feel embarrassed about their periods, and raise awareness for girls and women around the world who do not have access to feminine care products.

Stephanie Linus, filmmaker

Linus, 33, a Nigerian filmmaker and actor, created a Nollywood movie called Dry about obstetric fistula  a hole between the vagina and bladder (or rectum in some cases) that can result from prolonged obstructed labor in childbirth, leaving a woman unable to control her bodily waste. Some 2 million women are affected worldwide. Surgery can help but is not always an option, since many of the women affected are poor. She hopes her film educates the world about the problem, and she's raising money for the Extended Hands Foundation, which she set up to support surgical help.

Dr. Etheldreda Nakimuli-Mpungu, scientist

Mpungu, 41, is a Ugandan doctor and researcher who is a pioneer in treating symptoms of depression in people with HIV. The medical community in sub-Saharan Africa believed these individuals were ""beyond help,"" she says. She's developed therapeutic programs that have been welcomed by the patients: ""We were surprised because we had thought maybe people wouldn't want to come ... due to stigma, but they actually wanted something like this  so badly.""

Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, documentary filmmaker

Chinoy won the Oscar for best documentary, short subject, for A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness, which tells the story of honor killings in her home country of Pakistan from a rare point of view: the survivor's. Saba, an 18-year-old girl, was shot and thrown in a river by her own family for secretly eloping. But she lived to tell the tale. After the Pakistani prime minister watched the film, he pledged to change the laws to protect girls from honor killing.

Garmai Sumo, nurse, Ebola body collector

Sumo, 29, a nurse in Liberia, is the star of the Oscar-nominated short documentary Body Team 12. Amid the chaos of Ebola, Sumo was a voice of hope and faith. Today she works with children orphaned by the deadly virus.

Jugbeh Tarpleh Kekula, nurse

Kekula is a registered nurse who works nights in the emergency room at the Liberia Government Hospital in Buchanan, the third-largest city in the country. She also educates people about family planning through Planned Parenthood of Liberia. In December 2015, she won a contest called ""Integrity Idol"" for being an ""honest government official."" As she puts it: ""I do not hide my feelings. I'm someone who is bold; I am to the point. If even the oldest person does wrong to me, I will go and [say], 'What you did to me, I don't like it.' I believe in truthfulness; I believe in fairness. I hate lies. You know, stick to your words.""

npr.org,2014-07-03 00:00:00,Motorcycles As Literary Metaphor,['Matthew B'],"Vroom, Vroom, Hmmmm: Motorcycles As Literary Metaphor

i toggle caption Solvejg Wastvedt Solvejg Wastvedt

Motorcycles provide an open road for literature  literally and figuratively. They're sometimes the dramatic device writers use to talk about many things: adventure, rebellion, even inner peace. But motorcycles aren't just a metaphor at Bartel's Harley-Davidson shop in Marina Del Rey, Calif. They're loud and shiny and very real.

More on the Book Your Trip series For more great cycling tales, check out NPR's Book Your Trip series. We've got recommendations for literary travel by train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time machine and even giant peach.

This is where we find Jeff Bragg, who claims he has been riding since he was 3. He reads an excerpt from Hunter S. Thompson's book Hell's Angels: ""Tense for the action, long hair in the wind, beards and bandanas flapping, earrings, armpits, chains, whips, swastikas and stripped-down Harleys flashing chrome as traffic on 101 moves over, nervous, to let the formation pass like a burst of dirty thunder.""

In literature, motorcycles  and the people who ride them  often represent an outlaw spirit, danger and sex. For motorcyclist Allie MacKenzie, that's a no-brainer. ""Who in their right mind can pass up a bad boy on a bike?"" MacKenzie rides a Harley Sportster Forty-Eight. At Bartel's, she picks a passage from the book Motorcycle Man by Kristen Ashley: ""I was panting, and he was cursing. It was the most wonderful thing that had ever happened to me. If he would have asked me to, I would have jumped on the back of his bike and ridden to the ends of the Earth with him.""

On the opposite end of the motorcycle fascination spectrum sits Matthew B. Crawford. By his own description, he's in the ""knowledge industry."" He has a Ph.D. and has worked at think tanks. He also owns his own motorcycle repair shop in Richmond, Va., and he's the author of Shop Class as Soulcraft  a manifesto for the importance of working with one's own hands. Fixing, restoring and riding motorcycles, he says, is very different from writing about them.

Writing ... is like pulling teeth ... it's rare where you hit that state of flow where things are just clicking  which is kind of the routine experience on a bike.

""Writing-with-a-T is like pulling teeth,"" he says, enunciating the ""t"" sound. ""There are moments of pleasure when you feel like you've really nailed it. But it's this activity where I have to force myself to sit and go over something over and over again to try to get it right, and it's rare where you hit that state of flow where things are just clicking  which is kind of the routine experience on a bike, especially when there's like heavy traffic that's moving fast and there's all these obstacles. All of your senses are just keyed in and kind of hyper alert, so it's a very heightened state of consciousness.""

That state is what Rachel Kushner captures in her novel The Flamethrowers: ""I was going one hundred miles an hour now, trying to steer properly from my hunched position as insects ticked and thumped and splatted against the windscreen. It was suicide to let the mind drift,"" she reads.

Kushner's protagonist, Reno, races through the desert trying to break a land-speed record. ""She's in the moment, very present to it, because she doesn't want to crash,"" says Kushner. ""I wrote it based on, to some degree, my own experience. I know what it's like to go very fast on motorcycles. Those moments, they stay with you.""

In literature, motorcycle trips are sometimes an escape, a way to chase away a bad marriage, a midlife crisis. A more profoundly political coming-of-age ride took place in 1952, when a 23-year-old, pre-revolutionary Che Guevara set off from Buenos Aires with a friend on the back of a Norton 500 to explore South America. Guevara's book The Motorcycle Diaries was published in 1993, years after his death, and was later turned into a movie.

""These two young men with a shared love of adventure, of women, of speed, and this bike, and this shared political yearning,"" says journalist Jon Lee Anderson, author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Anderson says the seven- or eight-month motorcycle trip was really a coming of age for medical student Guevara and his friend.

""The idea [was] that they needed to see something of their continent beyond the rather privileged confines of their Argentina, their white Argentina,"" says Anderson. ""They took off on this bike and traveled through the indigenous and mestizo back roads and backwoods of their continent. It was an extraordinary experience for young Guevara. It really was a determinant in his life, deciding what he would become.""



The Norton broke down, as motorcycles will  but even that experience can take you someplace, a phenomenon Robert Pirsig examines in his now classic 1974 book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.

""When you get stuck on fixing motorcycles, that's not a bad moment. That's actually a pretty good moment,"" he told NPR in 1974. ""The times I've been stuck, I've been able to catch myself at being stuck and, instead of getting mad, just gone off and had a cup of coffee. And I notice whenever I'm stuck like that, that if I look at the clouds, the clouds are much more beautiful. I find at the very moment of stuckness, if you just stop and look around you, you find the world is very real.""

Back at Bartel's, biker Ron Hamberg reads from Zen, a moment in which Pirsig contrasts riding a motorcycle with the more passive act of driving in a car. In a car, Pirsig writes, ""you're a passive observer and it is all moving by you boringly in a frame. On a cycle, the frame is gone. You're completely in contact with it all. You're in the scene, not just watching it anymore. And the sense of presence is overwhelming.""

Hamberg  covered with tattoos  rides a Harley. He says he has read books by Charles Dickens, Mark Twain and Mahatma Gandhi. But as for books about motorcycles, he growls, ""I just ride 'em. I don't read about 'em.""",[]

Our panelists answer questions about the week's news....Half Off.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

We want to remind everyone they can join us most weeks right here at the Chase Bank Auditorium in downtown Chicago, Ill. For tickets and more information, go over to wbez.org or you can find a link at our website, waitwait.npr.org. Right now panel, it is time for you to answer some questions about this week's news. Adam, for years, scientists have been looking for the female Viagra. Well, a little while ago, something purporting to be the female Viagra was put on the market. And after studying its benefits, we now know it provides its users on average how many, quote, ""satisfying sexual encounters"" per month?

(LAUGHTER)

BOBCAT GOLDTHWAIT: Oh, I know this one.

ADAM BURKE: Here's my question...

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: Two questions - does it require someone else to be there, and how big is this pill?

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: It's a valid point.

SAGAL: Perhaps...

GOLDTHWAIT: Does this pill cuddle?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So as you know, Viagra, invented some years ago, has been a huge best-seller because it gets men, as you know, ready, willing and able.

BURKE: As I know - thanks. Thanks, Pete.

SAGAL: You're welcome. And according to careful studies of nearly 6,000 women who use this regularly, the effect of this pill was to arrange or create for them how many satisfying sexual experiences per month?

BURKE: Oh, like a frightening amount. Like...

SAGAL: Take a guess.

BURKE: Like debilitating.

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: Let's say - I have no idea - 15.

SAGAL: Lower.

BURKE: Is that...

SAGAL: Fewer, fewer, I should say.

BURKE: Yeah. I don't know, six?

SAGAL: Fewer.

BURKE: Really?

SAGAL: Yes.

BURKE: So, like, one?

SAGAL: Fewer.

BURKE: What?

GOLDTHWAIT: Zero.

ROXANNE ROBERTS: That's what I was going to - yeah.

BURKE: Wait, what is half of a satisfying sexual experience?

SAGAL: That's exactly right.

BURKE: Wow.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: One half of one satisfying sexual experience.

BURKE: Wait, yeah, one half of a satisfying sexual experience - that just describes most heterosexual couples.

SAGAL: Exactly.

GOLDTHWAIT: Yeah or when her husband comes home.

SAGAL: Yeah, pretty much. One half of one per month, every month. It's like a sex timeshare.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: You have to get a roll in the hay, but first you have to sit through a 45-minute presentation.

npr.org,2014-07-19 00:00:00,The Lure Of Literary Time Travel,['Connie Willis'],"Watch Out For That Butterfly: The Lure Of Literary Time Travel

i toggle caption The Kobal Collection The Kobal Collection

Where would you go, if you had a time machine? Ancient Egypt? Tang Dynasty China? The Globe Theater, in 1599? Or maybe to the 25th century, because who knows, Buck Rogers might actually be there.

Sadly, no one's likely to invent a working time machine any time soon. But that hasn't stopped the legions of writers who've been exploring time travel ever since H. G. Wells described his first Morlock. Slips and drops and nets and projections and paradoxes  writers have thought up a hundred ways to travel backwards and forwards in time. And that's one of the great things about literary time travel: the way every writer seems to invent the mechanism all over again, every time they put pen to paper.

You can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

""We can actually do whatever we want,"" says science fiction author Connie Willis. She's won all kinds of awards for her tales of time-traveling historians  like Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog. Willis says the best thing about time travel is no one's invented it yet  so it can be whatever you want.



""You know, you can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

Well, within reason  don't go stepping on any ancient butterflies, or accidentally shooting your own grandfather. You don't want to cause a paradox. ""The trickiest part of writing time travel is the paradoxes,"" Willis says, ""because the truth is, you know, we can't go back in time, one of the reasons is, just by being there we would change things, you know, so that's what you spend most of your time doing!""

Avoiding paradoxes is especially tricky for Willis, who's generally keeping track of multiple characters jumping around to different points in time. ""And I have to remember, that happened earlier, but later, and hasn't happened yet  and I usually end up writing angry notes to myself at the head of every page: she still thinks he's a murderer!""

Unlike Willis's historians, I can't go back in time  but I can do the next best thing, which is to visit Readercon, a speculative fiction convention that happens every year in Boston. If anyone knows about time travel literature, it's these folks. In fact, this year they held an entire panel devoted to time travel. Panel moderator  and occasional NPR contributor  K. Tempest Bradford is working on a time travel novel herself, ""basically doing Shakespeare's Twelfth Night with time travel instead of shipwrecks,"" she says.

Part of the appeal of time travel, Bradford adds, is the lure of experiencing other times and places. But it's also a chance for a cosmic do-over. ""I know that if I were to travel back in time, I might warn some people that they shouldn't do this or that thing, or they should maybe be careful who they trade blankets with.""

Writer, bookseller and Readercon attendee Leah Bobet says the past is fascinating because it's the one place we can't go, ""and there are so many ways time travel stories both question and reinforce the past-is-past paradigm. And so it's grappling with regret, it's learning to emotionally deal with the consequences of the one thing we can't really undo.""

It tends to be the past that people talk about, when they talk about time travel. ""And that's interesting,"" says Bobet, ""because the future is always coming. The future's coming whether you like it or not, second by second by second  the past is never coming again.""

Unless, of course, you have a time machine  and that brings us to the quintessential time traveler's dilemma: Assuming you could get to Berlin in 1937, should you kill Hitler? ""Oh yeah,"" says Connie Willis. ""That's the dilemma of time travel, is that no event is unconnected to every other event. And so you could bring about something much worse. Except that Hitler was so bad and so unique, I have a tendency to think that given the chance, yeah. You betcha.""

Personally, I might go back to Sarajevo in 1914 and slip Gavrilo Princip a knockout drop instead. If I had a time machine.",[]

SAGAL: Canadians can no longer apply to be contestants on ""Jeopardy."" ""Jeopardy"" says - it's a little unclear. They say it's because of Canada's new privacy laws on electronic communication. The Canadian government no longer allows ""Jeopardy"" to communicate with Canadian people the way that they want to, so no more Canadians.

The Labs' engineering group is recognized internationally as a radio technology authority. In 2003 the team developed digital multicasting for HD Radio, the replacement technology for analog radio, and they conducted research and tests that led to improvements in the performance of HD technology.

Multicasting makes it possible for all radio stations  commercial and non-commercial  to offer multiple streams of programming on one channel, free to the public. More Labs-initiated innovations in digital radio are underway, including development of accessible media services for those with hearing and vision impairments.

Satellite and International Radio

Beyond the radio station network, and web and mobile services and applications, NPR programs a channel on Sirius XM Satellite Radio and one web-based stream. NPR also produces multiple international services heard in more than 150 countries, provides programming for Armed Services Radio and operates a radio station in Berlin.

A Brief History Of NPR And Public Radio

1920s-'40s

Our roots go back to the earliest days of American broadcasting. In the 1920s, many of the country's first radio stations grew up at colleges and universities who wanted to experiment with this new medium to educate and entertain the public. In the late 1940s, the Federal Communications Commission allotted the lower end of the new FM band exclusively to noncommercial, educational stations, setting the stage for a major station expansion. This is where most public stations are still found today.

1950s-'60s

As commercial radio began its first decline with the advent of TV, public radio grew, along with public TV. The big breakthrough came in 1967, when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act. This new law led to the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which Congress called upon to encourage ""the growth and development of non-commercial radio"" and to develop ""programming that will be responsive to the interests of the people.""

CPB introduced technical and professional standards to improve what were then mainly small stations. Soon, CPB and individual stations saw the need for a national radio service to bring Johnson's vision to life.

1970s

NPR was incorporated on Feb. 26, 1970, by 90 forward-thinking charter stations to provide national news programming. In April 1971, NPR hit the air with live coverage of the Senate hearings on the war in Vietnam. Just a month later, NPR debuted its first weekday newsmagazine, All Things Considered. In 1977, NPR assumed a new responsibility  to represent the interests of NPR member stations (who had grown from 90 to 190)  before Congress, the FCC and others. NPR's morning newsmagazine, Morning Edition, launched in 1979, signaling that the network was becoming an all-day news service.

1980s

This was a decade of transformational and tumultuous change. NPR launched the first ever nationwide, satellite-delivered radio distribution network to serve a growing network of about 250 stations, ushering in a decade that saw an explosion in new national programs for public radio. In 1983, NPR suffered a severe financial crisis; it emerged with stronger governance and management, and an improved business model that ultimately propelled growth for both NPR and stations.

1990s

A growing interest in news  local, national and international, led to expanded distribution of NPR programming and growth in audience. The Gulf War inspired the 1991 launch of NPR's first talk program, Talk of the Nation, and ultimately, the emergence of the public radio news-talk format. NPR launched NPR Worldwide in 1993, providing programming beyond the boundaries of the U.S., and throughout the decade NPR stations expanded their services  acquiring additional stations and growing their own programming and operations. The effort in 1994 to eliminate federal funding for public broadcasting led to an unprecedented burst in contributions from listeners, and a groundswell of non-partisan political support from the public. Federal support for public broadcasting was maintained.

2000s

Sept. 11, 2001, was a turning point for NPR, a catalyst to shift our orientation even more fully to high-quality, contextual, timely news  both domestic and foreign. Over the past few years, NPR has extended its focus to build an equally compelling service on NPR.org, as well as mobile sites and apps. These digital platforms offer more ways to listen, learn and experience NPR and its member stations, and new people are discovering the network every day.

Today NPR is experiencing another era of innovation, not unlike the earliest days of radio  though much faster, and more chaotic and dynamic. The network's radio service offers a strong foundation, as NPR and its stations are actively embracing the power and potential of digital media to serve our mission.",[]

It's also a deeply cinematic story  in fact, it's currently in development as a miniseries at AMC. And even in its darkest moments, it's a compelling read: The Sparrow follows the crew of a near-future first-contact expedition to an alien planet, alongside the testimony of Jesuit priest Emilio Sandoz, who is recovering from his part in the ordeal. This isn't just a story about the rigors of space travel and the difficulties of establishing communication after contact. It also explores the way travel forces us to acknowledge what we've left at home, how travel can be an act of faith (regardless of religion), and the ways in which journeys demand internal audits to determine how we've changed in the crossing. (And if you can't get enough of Sandoz, you can follow him in The Sparrow's sequel, Children of God.)

There have been a couple times in recent weeks when people weve interviewed asked that we remove their names from the stories we posted on the Web. We have issued guidance on this topic several times before. Reminders seem to be in order about how to avoid getting into such situations and how to handle them if they arise.

Click on these headlines to see our guidance:

 This Story About You Is Going To Be On The Web Forever And You May Come To Regret That

 Reminder: Whether To Go With First-Name-Only Needs To Be Discussed And Explained

 How To Explain Why We Wont Take Down A Story

 When Were Asked To Remove A Photo, Heres What We Do

Here are some important points from those notes:

 Were not saying that Sen. Doe or Mayor Smith or CEO Jones need to be reminded that what they say to us is on the record and will be available to anyone with a Web connection. They should know what theyre doing.

 The notes dont cover reporting done in war zones or situations when stopping to have a long conversation about the long tail of the Web isnt safe or practical.

 But the guidance does cover other situations involving people who are vulnerable. Those include survivors of sexual assault, people with serious medical conditions and those whose lives may be put in danger if they are fully identified. As the handbook says, we minimize undue harm and take special care with those who are vulnerable or suffering.

We do not preview our stories for those we interview. But it is essential that vulnerable individuals understand in general how we will be using the information we get from them, how we will identify them and whether any images of them will be published (remember: visuals are important parts of our journalism and we treat them that way). There may be times when people say we can use their full names and photos and we are not comfortable doing so.

It must be made clear to such individuals that our stories do not only air on the radio  they live on various digital forms and will be searchable on the Web.

How such individuals names, biographical details and images will be handled must be discussed with a senior editor well before anything is aired or published. That means a supervising senior editor, a deputy managing editor or the standards & practices editor. In reality, theyll all probably be involved.

One other reminder (because were asked about it at least once a week):

When we decide to withhold a sources name from a story, we dont invent a pseudonym for that source.

i toggle caption Kevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty Images Kevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty Images

At pretty much any Lady Gaga performance, you can count on spectacle: whirling lights, elaborate sets and many, many costume changes. When she took the stage at the Grammy Awards this year, things were no different  except that she was deploying her famous pipes in the service of another artist's music. As she pinballed through David Bowie's catalog in a career-spanning tribute to the late icon, it was a reminder that the 29-year-old Gaga is as much a chameleonic overachiever as her hero. After six Grammys of her own, a Golden Globe for her role on American Horror Story: Hotel, duets with Tony Bennett, a Super Bowl national anthem and one very famous meat dress, there appears to be little that the woman born Stefani Germanotta cannot do.

And yet, she recently surprised herself. Alongside veteran hitmaker Diane Warren, Gaga co-wrote the song ""Til It Happens to You"" for the 2015 film The Hunting Ground, a documentary about rape on college campuses. The track is up for an Oscar, but the bigger breakthrough is a personal one. Like Warren, Gaga is a survivor of sexual assault, and says the decision to work on the song didn't come easily  but that once it was out there, stories from other survivors came flooding in, some prefaced with the admission that they'd never felt comfortable sharing their experiences until now.

Lady Gaga joined NPR's Michel Martin from New York to talk about songwriting that hits close to home, how artists and fans benefit from mutual support, and what David Bowie meant to her as a teenager gazing on the cover of Aladdin Sane for the first time. Hear the radio version at the audio link, and read more of their conversation below.

Michel Martin: I want to start off by talking about ""Til It Happens to You,"" which is nominated for an Oscar. I know it's not easy to talk about, but may I ask how you came to be involved in this project?

Lady Gaga: ""Til It Happens to You"" is something that has come out of a group of women coming together, who decided that they wanted to make a change. And that's me and Diane Warren and Bonnie [Greenberg], who was the music supervisor. When we first started talking, I was really not sure what to do. I have a very uncomfortable relationship with this topic because it's so personal to me, and I didn't know if I was ready to be a part of it. And as soon as I met Diane and she started to talk to me about what she wanted to do, I knew that I had to be brave, and I had to help tell this story to the world.

So, Diane and I met in New York City. She played me this song idea that she had started, and I immediately started crying. I was really unsure, even in that moment, if I was going to be able to do it. And she said, ""Well, I want you to make it your own. I want it to be something that you feel connected to."" And we started to change the song together  make it something that reflected both of our experiences with sexual assault. I guess it's a long story, but what I'm trying to say is that it's a quite complicated one. And it starts with me, when I was a young girl: I had this traumatic experience, and it's sort of coming full circle now, and really ending in a way for me, as I'm healing from it in writing this song with Diane.

Have other artists come to you since you recorded this song to talk about this issue? It just seems as though a number of people in your industry have had similar experiences and didn't talk about it for years, or ever.

Yeah, there are. I wouldn't reveal names of anyone that came to me personally to express that they had been through something similar. But there's a lot of people, men and women all over the world, who have experienced sexual assault not only on campuses and not only in the music industry, but within their own families and within their own relationships. It has been kind of overwhelming for both Diane and I, the amount of letters and people on the street that stop us to talk about this song and to tell us how much it means to them. I've had reporters tell me about their experiences with sexual assault in interviews, and they've told me, ""I've never ever told anyone that but you."" You know, that's a powerful thing to witness.

As an artist, and also through your foundation, you've worked on some really raw and emotionally complex issues. Given that you have a voice you can use to elevate a topic, how do you decide what you want to talk about?

Well, I always have been an activist for things that were just authentically a part of my life, that I felt connected to. In terms of my involvement in ""don't ask, don't tell"" and marriage equality and anti-bullying and social emotional learning in schools  these are all things that arise out of my relationship with the world and with my fans. I listen to them, I meet with them, they write me letters; I'm in tune with what people want to change in the world, and I want to be a part of moving that forward. I just genuinely feel that that's what you do when you're an artist: You stick up for the people around you.

I imagine that's draining, emotionally and physically. How do you manage that work and still do all the other things you do?

I guess I don't really think about it that way, you know? This thing that I do with caring about the message in my music, it's not separate from my work as a commercial artist; they're totally one and the same. I'm always going to be thinking about what my voice means. When I was 22, putting out my first couple records, I was a baby  and nobody really views you as any type of role model or anything. But as you get older, you realize that you have the attention of a lot of young people. And you think, ""OK, well, what should I say now? What can I say that will be impactful in a positive way?""

You know, just bringing it back to ""Til It Happens To You"": What happened to me happened 10 years ago. And then I became famous like overnight, it felt like, and I never really had time to deal with my issues. As soon as you start to make money selling your music, there's a lot of people around you that are very excited about what you have to offer financially to business, and they start to maybe forget that there's a person underneath all of that. [So] my team now, they spend every day making sure that I am healthy and happy and that I am able to focus on the things that I love.

We have to talk about David Bowie and your tribute to him at the Grammys this year. He's somebody you've been compared to in some ways: constantly reimagining yourself, testing the boundaries of presentation. Your performance actually used computer graphics to draw his famous lightning bolt on your face as you sang. How did you get to this point?

YouTube

Well, the moment that I saw the Aladdin Sane cover for the first time, I was 19 years old, and it just changed my perspective on everything, forever. It was an image that changed my life. I remember I took the vinyl record out of the casing and I put it on my vinyl player  which was on my stovetop in my kitchen, because I was living in this really tiny apartment and I had my turntable on my stove. ""Watch That Man"" came on and, I mean, that was just the beginning of my artistic birth. I started to dress more expressively. I started to go to the library and look through more art books. I took an art history class. I was playing with a band.

I guess what I'm trying to tell you is, my friends and I in New York, we've lived a lifestyle of total immersion in music, fashion, art and technology since we were kids  and this is because of him. I just would never be here, or have the philosophy that I have, if I didn't have someone to look up to that you know blew my mind so intensely. You know the way that Nile Rodgers talks about Coltrane, and the way that Coltrane makes him think about jazz? That's how David Bowie is for me. You meet or see a musician that has something that is of another planet, of another time, and it changes you forever. I believe everyone has that, don't you? That one thing you saw as a kid that made you go, ""Oh, okay. Now I know who I am.""

How do you feel now that the tribute is over? I mean, it had to come together so quickly, and it was so complex and had so many layers to it.

How do I feel now that it's over? I mean, I feel like my whole career is a tribute to David Bowie.

So it's not! It's ongoing, right?

It's still going. I've been watching his videos all day long, and also listening to Blackstar, his last album, which is a truly incredible piece of music. It's one of the single greatest things an artist has ever done: making a masterpiece album that is their own eulogy. Can you imagine? To go into the studio every day and put your heart in that place, where you are saying goodbye to life? I mean, his art made him strong.",[]

The National Park Service wants you to get out into nature.

But the success of campaigns like the National Park Service's Find Your Park and others from state tourism offices has created a huge demand. Last year, a record 305 million people visited national parks. As the Park Service likes to point out, that's more people than went to every single Disney park, NFL, NBA and MLB game and NASCAR race combined.

Zion National Park  famous for its jaw-dropping, red sandstone cliffs and colorful panoramic views  recently had lines 300 deep just to get on a shuttle bus that goes from the park to the visitors center.



Last year, Zion in southern Utah set its own record. Nearly 4 million people squeezed into this 6-mile-long canyon, most coming between March and November.

No, thanks, says Norma Dunton, who made a point to plan her recent trip for a weekday, in winter, when crowds tend to thin out. She is worried about the future of these protected places.

""They have to save the parks. Our children need to have to have this connection with nature,"" Dunton says.

Dunton has been coming to Zion to hike for 40 years, and every year she says the congestion gets worse.

""As much as I don't like the idea of reservations to get into the parks, but, it would be worth it to save the parks if that's what they have to do,"" Dunton says.

Pretty much every idea is on the table right now for some of the country's oldest and most popular parks like Zion: reservations, phased entries for cars, daily caps on visitors.

Jack Burns is in charge of crowd management at Zion. He's standing at one of the worst pinch points in the canyon: the popular Temple of Sinawava.

""Zion was never designed to see, literally, millions of people,"" Burns says.

About 15 years ago, traffic and air pollution got so bad here that the park banned cars at certain times. Now Zion's mandatory shuttle system is held up as an example of how parks can better manage crowds. But it is getting stretched to its limit.

""We also realize that we are looking at a capacity issue here,"" Burns says.

At extremely busy parks like this, managers are starting to talk about turning people away at the gates. This is where things get sticky. The mission of the Park Service is to keep these public lands open and accessible. More visitors getting out into nature is a good thing. But it's straining infrastructure. There's a nearly $12 billion backlog on maintenance. Search and rescue teams are understaffed.

And the number of human-wildlife conflicts is on the rise.

So are we loving our national parks to death?

""We're running out of room for people to have these wonderful experiences, and the agency and the partners of the agency are going to have to do a great job of figuring this out and probably figuring it out pretty soon,"" says Joan Anzelmo, a retired park superintendent in Jackson, Wyo. She's now with the Coalition to Protect the National Parks.

Anzelmo says we're getting used to having to make reservations for concerts or other popular activities, and we might need to start thinking that way for some of our most popular national parks.

""If we want to have these places for another 100 years and beyond, you might not be able to do everything at the same time. There may need to be certain kinds of modest limits on what you can do or how you can access certain areas of a national park,"" she says.

i toggle caption Kirk Siegler/NPR Kirk Siegler/NPR

For this, the Park Service's centennial year, one of its main strategies is to try to divert people to other, less visited parks. So instead of going to Zion, have you considered Capitol Reef next door or maybe the Great Basin in Nevada? Or if you do go to Zion, why not go now, beat the crowds?

That was Chung Kim's plan. He's taking his parents who are visiting from Korea on a winter swing through the national parks of the Southwest.

""We've been to Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, and this [Zion] is like, my third national park here. I like this national park the best,"" he says.

In Korea's national parks, Kim says, people regularly line up just to get on a hiking trail.

So to his parents, the gorgeous open valley where the Virgin River dumps out of a narrow slot canyon looks like pristine wilderness, Kim says.

""Still less crowded than in Korea, so, they like it here,"" he says.",[]

A BBC journalist tweeted Wednesday that Queen Elizabeth II had been admitted to King Edward VIIs Hospital in London, leading at least one other major news outlet  CNN  to tell its affiliates that the queen had been hospitalized and setting off speculation that she had died.

The queen is apparently fine and is not in the hospital. The backstory, according to the BBC, is that it was conducting a technical rehearsal for an obituary and tweets were mistakenly sent from the account of a BBC journalist.

The BBC has apologized. CNN, which tweeted the news without citing any source, subsequently told affiliates to please disregard our previous tweet about Queen Elizabeth. It was sent in error.

We should note that there but for the grace of God go we. But this is also a reminder of why, as the Ethics Handbook says, we do not just spread information we see on social media, even if its posted by usually reliable news outlets. We are careful and skeptical.

Heres part of what we say in the handbook:

When determining whether to pass along information being reported on social media sites by other news outlets or individuals, be thoughtful. When we point to what others are saying, in the eyes of many we are effectively reporting that information ourselves. ... Above all, proceed with caution, especially when news is breaking and accounts vary widely about what is happening. Reach out to other sources for confirmation. And the general standard is simple: Tweet and retweet as if what youre saying or passing along is information that you would put on the air or in a traditional NPR.org news story. If it needs context, attribution, clarification or knocking down, provide it. News moves fast on the Internet, and we know that speed and accuracy are fierce rivals, so keep your guard up. Ask questions, report and engage as you would in any public setting. But remember that everything you say or do in a social media environment is effectively a public statement from an NPR journalist, so dont pass along inaccurate information.

i toggle caption Theo Wargo/Getty Images Theo Wargo/Getty Images

On Friday night, I finally got to see Hamilton, the critically acclaimed musical I've been surprisingly obsessed with since Frannie Kelley's glowing write-up of the cast album last fall.

I say ""surprising"" because I am not a fan of musical theater, the kind of not-a-fan-of-musical-theater who pointedly self-describes as such should musical theater come up in conversation. But there I was, gripping my seat, as Leslie Odom Jr., the virtuoso who plays Aaron Burr, stood onstage by his lonesome in ""Wait For It,"" my favorite song in a show lousy with fantastic songs.

That number, all about frustrations and ambition and jealousy and doubt, knocked me on my ass the first time I heard it on the album,  like, wtf, do I actually like musicals now?  and the live experience was equally overwhelming. I'd read somewhere that Odom and other cast members regularly focus their attentions on particular audience members while performing, and I'm 95 percent sure that Odom was looking dead at me in the sixth row, as I mouthed along all the words to his song. Just two Philly dudes separated by a few dozen feet and a gaping chasm of musical ability sharing this moment of real connection.

I told my colleague/friend Stephen Thompson, who was with me that night, about this during intermission, and he joked that it was probably because Odom and I seemed to be the only black guys in the theater that night. We laughed, but it was hard not to notice that while Hamilton has been hailed for deliberately casting actors of color as some of America's most venerated Dead White Men, and ""reclaiming the American story ... for the people whom history habitually forgets,"" the actors onstage seemed to make up the majority of brown people in the house the night I went.

This is of course an unscientific study, based on me craning my neck and looking around the room, but three other folks who've seen the show recently tell me the audience was overwhelmingly white when they went, too. Yesterday, I asked folks on Twitter who've seen the show to share their experience, and many of them told me the same thing.

I'm avoiding making a too-obvious ""Great White Way"" joke here, but it seems these observations track with Broadway audiences in general; according to The Broadway League, the trade association for the Broadway theater industry, nearly 8 in 10 people who saw Broadway shows in 2014-2015 were white and in their mid-40s. (That's more diverse and a decade younger than NPR's audience, for the record.) About 80 percent had college degrees and about 40 percent had graduate degrees.

Now, I'm not arguing that black and brown folks ""should"" go to Broadway shows, and there is, of course, lots of theater, far from Broadway, that caters to audiences of color. But it's worth asking why this ostensibly uber-POC-friendly phenomenon isn't consistently pulling a notably black and brown audience.

A bunch of folks in the Twitter conversation yesterday suggested that who goes to Broadway shows is a simple matter of dollars and cents. James McMaster at HowlRound recently made a similar assertion about Hamilton, which you pretty much can't see without parting with a couple of hundred bucks:

The exorbitantly high ticket prices coupled with the perpetually sold-out status of the production prohibit most working class people of color from attending the show. Given that the production's audience, then, is overwhelmingly white and upper-middle-class, one wonders about the reception of the show's racial performance. How many one-percenters walk away from Hamilton thinking that they are on the right side of history simply because they exchanged hundreds of dollars for the opportunity to sit through a racialized song and dance? My guess: too many.

This is a compelling argument, but then again, nearly half a million folks book flights and hotels and tickets for EssenceFest in New Orleans each year. Then there's the mad rush a few weeks back for tickets for Beyonce's surprise tour. That is to say, there's a whole lot of pricey entertainment that people of color are willing to drop serious dough on, but Broadway shows like Hamilton don't seem to rate. Money matters, of course, but it's not the whole story.

When it comes to race and Broadway audiences, a big part of the story seems to be acculturation. Theater has a long history of segregated seating and plays chock full of racist caricatures that meant black folks, in particular, never warmed to Broadway. ""Theatergoing on Broadway is supported by families who collected programs going back 50 or 80 years,"" James Hatch, the co-author of A History of African American Theatre, told WNYC in 2012. ""Blacks did not have that tradition, and apparently still don't.""

That plays out today in the important, subtle social cues about who belongs. It's hard enough getting comfortable in a social space when you're unfamiliar with its rules and conventions. It's even harder when you're aware of how much you stand out. At Broadway shows like Hamilton, you get the honor of having that experience for a few hundred dollars. Even as Hamilton exceeded my impossibly high expectations, I felt a vague unease sitting there that night, like I was at a hip-hop show where my favorite group was performing, but I might get shushed for rapping along too loudly. (But c'mon, y'all: HERCULES MULLIGAN!)

Not being a regular theatergoer or a Broadway vet meant I didn't know exactly how to be in the audience. I was unfamiliar enough with the ritual and customs of that space to be worried that I might be doing it wrong somehow. Could that disconnect be keeping folks who might shell out comparable cash for Bey, even if it means traveling to another city, from doing the same for Hamilton? Something I've been chewing on, and sound off on Twitter if you think I'm wildly off-base here.",[]

But it granted actor Ben Afflecks request that it not mention his slave-owning ancestor. Affleck says he was embarrassed by the discovery and didnt want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves.

For the record, the decision made by Finding Your Roots was not in line with our standards.

PBS ombudsman Michael Getler has had some things to say about what happened:

 Any serious program about genealogy, especially dealing with celebrities, cannot leave out a slave-owning ancestor.  This censorship should have been stopped cold and mistakes should have been admitted publicly.

Over the past few decades, New York City has become safer, richer and a lot more crowded than it used to be. All over Manhattan these days, you can see apartment buildings going up  and yet finding a decent place to live has become tougher than ever.

""We are in an official housing crisis, period, in New York City,"" says Alicia Glen, New York City's deputy mayor for housing and development. ""Our population is growing much more rapidly than our housing stock and so we have a really imbalanced housing market.""

Mayor Bill de Blasio has proposed a plan to ease the housing shortage, but it's encountering opposition from some of the people hit hardest by the shortfall.

According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, New York is the fourth most expensive state to rent a two-bedroom unit. In a city where most people rent, the apartment vacancy rate now is just 3 percent.

Glen says in recent years, a lot of new people have moved into the city and there are more single people living alone. Changes in rent control laws caused the city to lose 250,000 affordable apartments over the past few decades, leading to an even tighter market.

But the problem of affordable rents is not just in New York. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies found a record number of ""cost-burdened"" households in 2013 nationally, and the NLIHC reports that the cost of housing has continued to rise as incomes for minimum-wage and low-wage workers have stagnated.

And as the housing crisis forces middle-income earners to migrate out of cities, the low-income earners find themselves being pushed out by newcomers.

A City Too Expensive To Live In

David Infante and Simon Keyes are two buddies from college in their 20s with pretty good jobs. Not long ago, they spent three days looking for an apartment in lower Manhattan. Keyes says they wanted two bedrooms and a dishwasher and they didn't want to walk up too many flights of stairs.

""We didn't want to spend more than ... $1,400 per person was the absolute limit and those things combined with the dishwasher made things pretty hard in New York City,"" he says.

Eventually they found something in their price range, but it was in a gritty part of Brooklyn, across from a hospital where they often hear sirens. Infante says he expected to have trouble finding a place to live in New York. It's almost part of the glamour of the place, but it wears you down.

""If you sort of did an exit poll on people who did five years in New York, 10 years in New York and decided to get out, housing and the constant runaround of it would probably be something that everyone cites, or at least most people,"" Infante says. ""That's something that will probably ultimately drive me from New York, for example.""

In New York, after controlling for inflation, median rents have increased 12 percent in eight years  at a time when incomes are up just 2 percent, says Ingrid Ellen, professor of public policy and urban planning at New York University.

""Low-income households are struggling to pay their rent in every city in the United States,"" Ellen says. ""And what really makes New York City stand out is that moderate-income renters are struggling.""

City officials are worried that a lot of people will be driven from the city. Landlords typically demand that prospective tenants have $40,000 in annual income for every $1,000 in rent, which means a six-figure income will get you a pretty nice one-bedroom in much of Manhattan and Brooklyn.

""It may be hard for somebody who lives in the Midwest or the South to believe that you could make $100,000 a year here and have a family of four and not be able to find an affordable place to live,"" says Glen, the deputy mayor. ""But a $100,000 a year could be a teacher and a nurse, and those people are the lifeblood of New York City.""

Glen says new housing is being built in New York, but the high cost of construction and land makes it hard for developers to earn a profit except at the high end.

Douglas Wagner, an executive at a real estate firm in New York, says even as competition for affordable housing surges, there is an oversupply of expensive apartments  places that start at $8,500 a month.

""Now especially in better buildings, there are a lot of empty apartments looking for tenants and for the first time in some time, offering major incentives to get tenants to take apartments at this level,"" he says.

A Plan To Increase Affordability

i toggle caption James Keivom/New York Daily News via AP James Keivom/New York Daily News via AP

Mayor de Blasio has a plan to ease the housing shortage by rezoning some neighborhoods to allow more construction and requiring developers to build more affordable housing.

Bedford-Stuyvesant is a neighborhood in Brooklyn once synonymous with crime and urban neglect. Now, it attracts a lot of young people who move there in search of affordable rents. BRP Cos., a real estate developer, is taking advantage of the opportunity.

""There had been a lot of disinvestment, but the bones were there and it was a close commute to Manhattan and we just thought it was a good bet for development,"" says Andy Cohen, director of the company.

BRP is a for-profit company, but many of the apartments it builds are set aside for low- and moderate-income people with the help of tax credits and other government programs.

Using developers like BRP, the de Blasio administration plans to build or preserve some 200,000 affordable apartments.

""We put together what has been characterized as the most ambitious and comprehensive affordable housing plan in the country by far,"" Glen says.

The plan would harness some of the intense development pressure sweeping the city. The mayor wants to rezone neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant to make it easier for private developers to build by modifying some of the zoning regulations that drive up costs, such as building height restrictions or the requirement that apartment buildings have underground garages.

Jerilyn Perine, executive director of nonprofit Citizens Housing and Planning Council, says a lot of these regulations are obsolete.

""Department of City Planning now is really trying to sort of step back and say there were things that were done, particularly in the mid-'80s, they were good ideas, they were helpful then. But now we really need to make sure that we can add to our housing stock,"" she says.

In exchange, the city would force developers that want to build in the city to construct more affordable apartments, Glen says.

""It's both attacking it from a supply-and-demand perspective, but then saying the market alone will not actually solve this problem,"" she says. ""We need to aggressively subsidize and use every tool we have to make sure that we're bringing on enough affordable housing.""

But the plan is encountering opposition from some of the people hit hardest by the housing shortage.

Gentrification At The Heels Of Development

The housing shortage is driving more and more middle-income New Yorkers into the further reaches of Brooklyn and Queens, bringing a new wave of gentrification that threatens to displace a lot of low-income people from those neighborhoods.

The mayor's plan has encountered opposition in some of the poorest neighborhoods. The buildings, like a BRP apartment in Brooklyn called the Bradford, are designed to house people of different income levels. Gone are the days when large projects were built to house huge groups of poor people.

""We think generally it's better to have a mix of incomes living in a neighborhood rather than either a low or high income because you just get a more vibrant community,"" Cohen says.

The Bradford houses some very poor people, but the largest group of tenants is moderate income, which in New York can mean an annual salary of $120,000 for a family of four. The rent they pay to live there can reach $2,400 a month. That puts it well out of reach for a lot of the neighborhood's poorest residents.

Rachel Rivera, a mother of six, showed up at a town hall meeting in East New York to protest the mayor's plan. Rivera lives on disability. She says local landlords are already pushing people out of their apartments to lure newcomers with higher incomes and she worries that there won't be enough apartments for people like her under the rezoning plan.

""What I'm worried about is that I get pushed out and I won't be able to afford these 'affordable housing' that they say that they're going to put up,"" she says.

City officials are aware of concerns like Rivera's. But they say allowing a mix of incomes is the best way to make sure buildings stay economically viable. They also say that by replacing some of the city's low-rise neighborhoods with higher-density apartment towers, they will ultimately be able to build more low-income housing.

As a wave of development pressure is washing over New York, the challenge now is to channel that pressure to build the kind of city that New Yorkers want.",[]

toggle caption Dr. P. Marazzi/Science Source

Medicare is going to test new ways to reimburse doctors for medications, in hopes they'll choose less expensive drugs.

The plan would alter Medicare Part B, which pays for medicines administered in doctors offices or outpatient hospital clinics  to eliminate incentives for doctors to use the most expensive drugs.

The changes would have an outsize effect on cancer doctors and clinics. Medicare Part B shelled out about $7.8 billion on cancer drugs in 2014, or 42 percent of its total spending on drugs that year.

The program now reimburses the doctors or clinics for the cost of the medication plus a 6 percent fee. That means doctors and hospitals earn more money when they use pricier drugs.

As it is now, Dr. Patrick Conway, chief medical officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, called the reimbursement structure ""perverse.""

""We've heard from oncologists who feel pressure from their health system to pick higher cost drugs even when they are not appropriate for a patient,"" he said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.

The agency plans to test a reimbursement formula that would pay the cost of the drug, plus a 2.5 percent surcharge and a flat fee of $16.80.

Under the current system, a doctor earns just 60 cents for administering a $10 medication. An equivalent drug that cots $1,000, however, would bring in $60. Under the proposed formula, the cheaper drug in this example would generate a payment of $16.93 and the second one $41.80, according to CMS.



CMS officials say that change would mostly eliminate the incentive to choose a high priced drug over one that may be more appropriate. Medicare Part B spent about $20 billion on outpatient medicines last year.

""We're trying to align the incentives to what's best for patients and doctors,"" Conway said.

The Medicare Part B plan would also reduce or eliminate the share of the drugs' costs that patients have to pay.

Dr. Peter Bach, director of The Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, says research shows doctors prescribe higher priced drugs when they bring in more profit.

""It is refreshing to see Medicare move towards an experiment where they pay for drugs using a flat fee reimbursement, where what doctors and hospitals make is related to giving the drug, not how much it costs,"" Bach said in a statement to Shots.

But other cancer doctors aren't so thrilled.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology opposes the CMS proposal. The proposal could have a major effect on oncologists because many cancer patients receive their chemotherapy treatments in doctors offices or clinics.

""It is inappropriate for CMS to manipulate choice of treatment for cancer patients using heavy-handed reimbursement techniques,"" said ASCO CEO Allen Lichter in a statement posted on the physician group's website.

ASCO, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association and about 100 other physician and advocacy groups sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell last week opposing the payment changes.

""We believe that this type of initiative, implemented without sufficient stakeholder input, will adversely affect the care and treatment of Medicare patients with complex conditions,"" the letter said.

The agency plans to field test the new reimbursement formula, as well as a handful of others ideas, in different regions of the country starting later this year. CMS will then compare the results to determine which changes are effective at reducing drug spending.

CMS is also planning to test a handful of so-called value-based pricing ideas. The first would pay for drugs according to how well they work.

For example, if a cancer medication is very effective in eliminating a specific tumor, but is also used on a second, different condition with less success, Medicare will pay less when it is used for the second condition than the first. Sloan Kettering's Bach, who served as an adviser to CMS on cancer policy in 2005 and 2006, argued for varying payments for drugs this way in a 2014 paper published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association. The approach is called indication-based pricing.

The agency also plans to work with drugmakers to link prices to patient outcomes, perhaps paying less for medications when patients end up being admitted to a hospital.

Private insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been testing similar ideas.

Cigna last month said it had agreed with drugmaker Novartis on a pay-for-performance deal for the heart failure drug Entresto. Under the agreement, Cigna will pay less if patients taking the medication are hospitalized for heart failure.

And Express Scripts, the biggest manager of pharmacy benefits, says it's working with cancer drug manufacturers to pay indication-based prices that tie cost to how well the drugs perform.

The CMS proposal is open for public comment until May 9. Conway said the field tests will begin after the comment period is complete.",[]

Florida is the next prize on the GOP primary calendar with 99 delegates at stake. Most polls show Trump in the lead. Florida is Marco Rubio's home state but analysts don't expect him to eke out a win.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Two more huge prizes loom in the presidential campaign next week. One is Ohio, where Gov. John Kasich hopes at last to win a state. Another is Florida, where immense amounts of money are being spent - we're told - to challenge Donald Trump and support home state Sen. Marco Rubio. NPR's Asma Khalid is in Miami. She's been following both the Trump and Rubio campaigns. Asma, good morning.

ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.

INSKEEP: I hope it's nice in Miami. How organized is Donald Trump in Florida?

KHALID: You know, I think that's been the perennial question about the Trump campaign is how organized is he anywhere? And thus far I don't know that that's mattered. But I will say in Florida so far I have been fascinated by how organized he does seem to be. You know, folks here say that this is kind of like a second home for him. He has a bunch of properties here. And he also started coming to the state months ago. And these were not, you know, just small visits to a retirement community here and there. These were massive rallies as far back as October. And I think the other thing that's really interesting is that he made some strategic hires early on. And he's connected to people who know grassroots organizing in the state. You know, for example, his deputy director used to be the data director for the state party. And so he made these key hires. And I think that's helped him so far.

INSKEEP: And when you say data director, you are alluding to what we're talking about. Do you have names of people who could be supporters? Do you have an organization to phone them or knock on their doors? Are you reaching out to people? Do have prominent Republicans on your side? That's what Trump is trying to do. What about on Rubio's side? Obviously he's the home state guy. Does he have a good organization?

KHALID: You know, Rubio is essentially banking everything here on Florida. I was at his Miami office the other day. And there are people there phone banking both in English and in Spanish. You know, I think what's important to understand is that not only is he the home state senator but that he is really campaigning. And he has been campaigning here nonstop. You know, he wasn't even focused on those March 8 contests yesterday. He was spending the past couple of days here in Florida. And his campaign says that they're really focused on two big geographic areas. He wants to do well in the I-4 corridor. So that's the area that stretches from Orlando to Tampa. The thinking is that there's just a lot of people there and there's certainly a lot of suburban and urban voters.

INSKEEP: Yeah.

KHALID: And we've seen Rubio, you know, do better with those kinds of voters. The other part of his strategy entails a really big win in Miami-Dade County. You know, this is Rubio's home turf. And he needs his neighbors to show up in record numbers at the polls. I think that's a big question. They are - certainly they got, I think, into the game, some could say, later than perhaps the Trump campaign and certainly later than the Jeb Bush folks who had a headquarters here in Miami. But they are in an intense media blitz. You can turn on the radio. You'll hear the campaign advertising on local Spanish stations even here on the radio.

INSKEEP: OK, just got about 20 seconds left. What about Ted Cruz? Is he a factor in Florida?

KHALID: You know, Cruz is campaigning. This morning he's actually holding a rally here in Miami. He's also opened up about 10 offices in the state. And I think it would be a huge surprise for Cruz to actually be able to win Florida. But what he wants to do is he wants to ensure Rubio does not win Florida because I think Cruz is eager to turn this campaign into a two-man race, especially given how poorly Rubio did last night.

INSKEEP: OK, Asma, thanks very much.

KHALID: You're welcome.

The official statistics for shootings by police in America are bad to non-existent. The totals are under-reported, and the Justice Department admits it doesn't have crucial details such as the race of people shot, and whether they were armed.

Since the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Mo., after the police killing of Michael Brown, this lack has become an embarrassment. But that's slowly beginning to change.

KPCC Analysis Of Police Shooting Data i toggle caption KPCC KPCC

Take, for instance, the nation's second-largest metro area, where NPR member station KPCC in Pasadena, Calif., has created a database of shootings by law enforcement officers in Los Angeles County from 2010 to 2014.

KPCC analyzed paperwork from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office, which reviews police shootings; the L.A. County medical examiner provided the ethnicity of fatal shooting victims.

During those five years, KPCC found, police shot 375 people; no officers were prosecuted. Of the people shot, about one in four was unarmed. And 24 percent of those shot and killed were black, while African-Americans make up 8 percent of the L.A. County population.

The dataset also includes a breakdown of factors such as the justifications given by police who shoot suspects.

For instance, 148 people were shot for moving their hands out of sight or reaching for their waistbands; of those, 47 turned out to be unarmed.

When Is Use Of Force Justified?

Whether that proportion seems high is up for debate. As KPCC's reporting about those shootings puts it:

""[Michigan State University criminologist William Terrill] said he doesn't think missing hands alone are enough to justify self-defense. 'If they were shooting all the suspects that reach or don't show their hands when the officer wants them to,' he said, 'I can't imagine the number of police shootings  if the public thinks there's a high number now  I can't imagine what there would be.' Los Angeles Sheriff's Department Commander Rod Kusch, whose homicide bureau investigates all deputy shootings, disagrees. 'There is nothing that requires us to actually wait and see the gun or wait to see the knife,' he said. Deputies' 'background, training and experience' with armed suspects triggers a self-protection response when a suspect's hands disappear, he said.""

American police have considerable leeway in these situations because of two Supreme Court rulings in the late 1980s. In essence, the court held that officers may use deadly force if they have a reasonable belief that the suspect poses imminent danger of bodily harm to them or someone else. In addition, officers may not be judged based on information they didn't have at the moment they employed deadly force.

In fact, on Monday, the Supreme Court bolstered the protections for officers, when it ruled that an officer in Texas could not be sued for shooting into a fleeing car from a highway overpass.

Police say these standards are only fair, and without them they would live in constant fear of being second-guessed after the fact. They say if they had to worry about being prosecuted for honest mistakes or for misreading a threat, they wouldn't be able to do their job.

On the other side, groups such as Black Lives Matter say this benefit of the doubt has gone too far. They say prosecutors are too deferential to police, and overly aggressive use of force routinely gets a pass.

Growing Efforts To Collect Statistics

Missing from this debate are good numbers. The federal government has tried  and failed  to get police agencies to report details about the use of deadly force. FBI Director James Comey often complains about how little data Americans have to work with, when debating policing and race.

Even some police organizations say it's a problem; they say the current national discussion relies too much on anecdotes and high-profile incidents caught on video, and they say better statistics would create a more sympathetic view of how police use force.

The federal government isn't about to require police agencies to start reporting these numbers, but it is experimenting with the next best thing. The Bureau of Justice Statistics has a pilot program to gather detailed information about ""arrest-related deaths"" in America  and they're going to use ""open-source data"" as a basis for their statistics.

In other words, they'll draw on information that media organizations such as KPCC are collecting on police shootings. Equipped with these numbers, the BJS will then ask police agencies directly for more information on the cases that have been identified.",[]

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Our guest today is writer Richard Price, whose novels and screenplays vividly portray the lives of cops, criminals, hustlers and people doing their best to do good. His latest novel, ""The Whites,"" is now out in paperback.

Price wrote ""Clockers,"" the novel about police detectives and drug dealers which Price and Spike Lee adapted into a film. And he wrote for the HBO series ""The Wire,"" which was also about police detectives and drug dealers. Price started his career with the novel ""The Wanderers,"" about street gangs in the Bronx, where he grew up. He wrote the screenplay for ""Sea Of Love,"" which starred Al Pacino as a homicide detective, and the screenplay for the movie adaptation of his novel ""Freedomland,"" which starred Samuel Jackson.

Richard Price returns to the world of police detectives in his latest novel, ""The Whites,"" which is set in New York. In a New York Times book review, Michiko Kakutani praised Price for using detective work as a framework on which to build complex investigations into the human soul.

Terry spoke to Richard Price last year, when ""The Whites"" was published in hardback.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

Richard Price, welcome back to FRESH AIR. I love your writing, so I'm going to ask you to start with a reading from your new novel.

RICHARD PRICE: OK. This is from the first page of the first chapter.

(Reading) As Billy Graves drove down Second Avenue to work, the crowds worried him. Quarter past 1 in the morning, and there were still far more people piling into the bars than leaving them - everyone coming and going having to muscle their way through the swaying clumps of half-hammered smokers standing directly outside the entrances. He hated the no-smoking laws. They created nothing but problems - late-night noise for the neighbors, elbow room enough for the bar-cramped beefers to finally start swinging and a plague of off-duty limos and radio cabs, all tapping their horns to hustle fares.

It was the night of St. Patrick's - worst of the year for NYPD's night watch, the handful of detectives under Billy's command responsible for covering all of felony-weight Manhattan, from Washington Heights to Wall Street between 1 a.m. and 8 a.m., when there were no active squads in any of the local precincts. There were other worst nights - Halloween and New Year's Eve for two - but St. Patrick's was the ugliest - the violence, the most spontaneous and low-tech - stompings, blunt objects, fists, more stitches than surgeries, but some very malicious acting out.

One-fifteen in the a.m. - tonight, as always, the calls could come in at any time. But experience had taught him that the most fraught hours, especially on a drinking holiday, were between 3 a.m., when the bars and clubs started shutting down, everyone pouring out into the streets at once, and 5 a.m., when even the most hard-core animals were out of fuel and lurching off to oblivion. On the other hand, the city being the city, Billy never knew exactly when he'd see his pillow again. Eight a.m. could find him at a local precinct writing up bullets on an ag assault for the incoming day squad, while the actor was either still in the wind or snoring in a holding cell. It could find him hanging around the ER at Harlem Hospital or Beth Israel or St. Luke's Roosevelt, interviewing family and/or witnesses while waiting for the victim to either go out of the picture or pull through. It could find him strolling around an outdoor crime scene, hands in pockets, toe-searching through the detritus for shell casings.

Or - or - or if the prince of peace was afoot, and Yonkers-bound traffic was light, he could actually be home in time to take his kids to school. There were gung-ho detectives out there, even on the lobster shift, but Billy was not one of them. Mainly, he hoped each night that most of Manhattan's nocturnal mayhem was not worthy of his squad's attention - just petty nonsense that could be kicked back to patrol.

GROSS: That's Richard Price reading from his new novel ""The Whites."" Why did you want to return to writing about cops?

PRICE: Because it just finally dawned on me I always gravitate toward urban characters - street people, cops, the police and the policed because I can laugh when I write. I just love the language. I don't know how to make lawyers laugh. I don't know how to make doctors funny. I just need to feel like these people are zingers, no matter how heavy or tragic or light the subject is. I have to feel like I can be dead on.

GROSS: Why are cops funny in a way that, say, doctors aren't? They're both facing life-and-death situations - one in hospitals, one on the streets.

PRICE: I'm not saying the job is funny. I'm not saying surgery is funny. I'm just saying I know, I understand cops. A lot of the people I grew up with became cops. I mean, it's sort of like myself talking. A lot of the people in the street are people I've known all my life. I'm just very comfortable with them. And I feel like humor comes not out of being comical, but out of being dead-on accurate.

GROSS: So the main character in your novel ""The Whites"" is a cop who was demoted after he shot what you describe as a giant armed with a - with an already bloody lead pipe. And the bullet passed through that guy and hit a 10-year-old Hispanic boy and nearly killed him. So this double shooting earned the cop both a citation for bravery and a civilian review board hearing and kind of a demotion, too, and this is why he's on night watch.

So you're writing about this cop who totally accidentally shoots a 10-year-old boy. You're writing about - this is published at a time when there's so many people who are angry at police because of the deaths of young men like Michael Brown and Eric Garner. You're writing in this book about cops who have done good and cops who have done bad and cops who have done bad with the intention of doing good. And you're writing about everybody with a lot of empathy. And I'm wondering what it's like for you to have this novel about cops published at this time in our culture?

PRICE: Well, I think this time in our culture has always been with us. Ferguson, Eric Garner, the kid in the Pink Houses in Brooklyn who was shot by that rookie cop in the stairwell - things like this happen all the time. But this is the age of, you know, iPhones and cell snaps, but, you know, this has been through - God, can you imagine what it was like 75 years ago?

I wasn't intending to write about racial elements of, you know, police versus the police, as I've done in the past. But now that Eric Garner's happened, that Ferguson has happened, I feel people ask me, well, is this what your book's about? And frankly, it isn't. If I were to write a book that was inspired by the Eric Garner incident, I would not have used a pen name because that would be a book, like many of my others, that is talking to a larger ailment in the culture.

What I intended to write was a tight urban thriller where what you see is what you get. And for me, it was a very different kind of book. Of course, it resonates now, I mean, because - you know, because of the media blow-up over the latest types of incidents. But they were not in my mind when I was writing this book.

GROSS: Having spent so much time with cops and written so much about cops, I'd be curious to hear what it's been like for you to follow the news of those stories and to see how it's affected cops, how it's affected people who are so angry about the deaths of these young men.

PRICE: Well, my thoughts go to two places. One is that when cops are attacked, they close ranks. I mean, I'm not talking about the blue wall of silence, but I think what happens is us versus them. And I'm talking about incidents which the cops - like Ferguson, where an unarmed man was shot. When they get under attack with the media, they just close ranks. It's like Cape Buffalo, you know, when they see lions out there. You know, they're going to form a phalanx like Roman soldiers.

The other thing is that I think there are certain sub-climates of cop culture in which a city like Cleveland, which also - it was bad news that a guy shot an unarmed 12-year-old kid - or cities like Ferguson. Or, you know, as many cops have told me, Staten Island is an island unto itself, very unlike Manhattan Island, where I think the cops are insulated, you know, and have their own culture. And it's - they've always been this way. You know, it's like from time immemorial.

When cops feel isolated, when cops feel like there's nothing attacking their infallibility because the culture and the politicians around them, they kind of feel like they're in a world of their own, that they're the sheriffs. And what they do is what they do. And I think that is what you've been seeing, you know, in various places. They just close ranks, and honestly, they're feeling like it's been this way since time immemorial here in Cleveland. You know, how are we to be different?

GROSS: Right. You have so much empathy for all the characters in your books - for the cops, for some of the criminals, for the families of people who have been killed. Does that kind of empathy come naturally to you?

PRICE: I feel if you're going to write about a, quote, unquote, ""villain,"" and you make him just a villain, you know, might as well make a movie for, you know, the old 42nd Street movie strip. I mean, what's interesting is the gray. No one is all one way. Everybody became that way over the course of their life. And to just see them on the surface as the bad guy or the good guy - it's all paper tiger land. I mean, yeah, that's what makes a novel - the complexity of the characters.

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Richard Price, who has a new novel is called ""The Whites."" Why don't you explain what ""The Whites"" are? It's not a racial reference.

PRICE: No. But given my history of writing, you know, I don't mind, you know, that it's a little confusing because any time you write about police and justice, there's always a racial undertone, you know, even if it's not addressed directly. I mean, that's the world.

""The Whites"" - I've always seen detectives. Since 1986 there's always been one guy in every precinct who's been so haunted by a case that they either knew who did it and couldn't prove it or the guy walked and the cop - it just gets inside this cop to the point when they retire, they're sneaking out all the legal boxes with, you know, all the case files, all the transcripts, the interviews and everything. And they're going to continue working on it in their basement - you know, have a six pack of beer and start making odd calls like they're still cops. They can't let go of this thing. This thing can't let go of them. And it's different for every cop.

What - in a world - 20 years of mayhem - they each pick one case that got to them. And it's rarely the goriest case. It's rarely about a body count. It's about some element of this crime that spoke to them - identification with the aggressor, identification with the victim, there but for the grace of God go I. The grieving family just feels like the family wish I had and I never had. It's a kid - anybody who touches a kid. It's an old person. The point is, all these obsessed cops with their single case that's like malaria to them, they all reminded me of Ahab. So therefore, you know, they're looking for their whales. They're looking for their whites.

GROSS: Their great white whale. Did you actually like ""Moby Dick"" when you read it, and did you read it in high school?

PRICE: I tried reading it about five times before I actually got through it. And, yeah, I think it was, you know, when I was mature enough to read it and read it like, you know, a person that had some life under their belt, yeah, I thought it was a fantastic book. It does not obsess me. It's not the book I think about all the time. It just seemed apropos in terms of what I wanted to write.

DAVIES: Richard Price's novel ""The Whites"" is now out in paperback. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're listening to Terry's interview with writer Richard Price. His novel, ""The Whites,"" is now out in paperback.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

GROSS: One of the things I love about your writing is the great details in it and things you observe. There's a character - I won't say much about who he is - but there's a character named Milton Ramos who's Puerto Rican and had been married to a Jewish woman. So he's visiting his Jewish aunt at an assisted living facility. And in her room there's a bowl of silver and gold paper mache fruit, a plaster pair of life-sized praying hands, two ceramic menorahs and a glazed and mounted ram's horn, as well as a framed print of a fiddler floating sideways above an off-balance ghetto. I can't tell you how many times I've seen those things (laughter) in the 1960s.

PRICE: Well, you know what?

GROSS: What?

PRICE: That's my mother's room in assisted living.

GROSS: Really?

PRICE: Yeah, and she's not religious, except, you know, she identifies, and she's very emotional about being a Jew. But that's - I don't think she's been in a synagogue since I was bar-mitzvahed. But, you know, the whole point for me to go out is not - you know, the obvious things are the obvious things. But what breathes life, you know, into a scene or what my eyes register or what my heart registers are the tiny things. You know that I was vaguely describing a Chagall print. I can't tell you in my mother's place - which is nondenominational - I mean, even the Christians have Chagall paintings, you know, in their living rooms. The praying hands, all that - I mean, some of this stuff is obviously made up - or not obviously, but it is. But you can't tell which is which. But it's always been about the details for me, always.

I mean, the cops used to feel - I'd come out - what I wrote about in ""Clockers"" was really small. I mean, it was a small, petty life, you know, petty crime, a routine investigation. And a lot of the cops, after the book came out, said I can't believe you wrote about this stuff. You know, we intercepted, you know, a 50-kilo cocaine shipment. Why didn't you write about that? Because that's the stuff that's - you can read about that in the newspapers. What you can't read about is that this guy who had a fearsome reputation in the street not only lived with his grandmother, but didn't have a chest of drawers in his room and kept all his clothes in a jumble, in a pile going up to his hips. You know, and that's how he chose how to dress. But on the street, he was a legend. At his home, he looked like somebody should buy him a chest of drawers.

GROSS: There's more obesity in this novel than has been in previous novels of yours, which makes sense because there's more obesity in our culture than there used to be. Was that a conscious decision to put in, you know, several obese characters and to - also there's a former cop who's now a funeral director, and in one week he gets a 400- and a 500-pound corpse. And he realizes that if he adds on the weight of the coffin that his front steps are going to collapse from the weight. So he actually has to send these bodies to another funeral home because they're just too darn heavy.

PRICE: And the other funeral home was smart enough to put in reinforced steel on their steps because they know the situation.

GROSS: Yeah. So can you tell me a little bit about wanting to include obesity and deciding how you were going to get that to figure into the novel?

PRICE: Well, it wasn't a theme in any way. I wasn't responding to anything I read in, you know, Hello or Ok or People or Us, you know? But, you know, I live in Harlem and there's an obesity problem around where I live now that is hard not to see. Like I described in the book, you'll see a Roy Rogers, a Dunkin' Donuts and a big woman's muumuu shop and then a funeral home. You know, and it's like a de-evolution cartoon. It was right in front of my eyes.

I've been living there for close to seven years now and it was - depends where. You're not going to see that kind of obesity if I was writing about, you know, Gramercy Park or Tribeca, you know, but there are other parts of the city and, [expletive], the country. I mean, like I said, you know, there are fat people in Nebraska, too. You know, and it's a national plague, but I wasn't thinking about it anymore than just making observations through the eyes of a funeral director.

GROSS: Since you mentioned you live in Harlem now and have been living there for seven years, how come you moved there?

PRICE: Because when I was with my soon-to-be wife Lorraine Adams, the novelist, she - we were sitting there one day when we decided we were going to ultimately live together. And it just came up - where do you want to live? And it just came out of her mouth - Harlem. Now, I - my experience with Harlem, even though my grandmother had been born there in the turn of the 20th century, my experience with Harlem for the last 15 years before that was going up there with the crime scene unit to - or the night watch - to process a dead body on the sidewalk. And, you know, so I had a very narrow view of Harlem. I'd just go up there for death. So when she said Harlem, you know, I thought - gulp. OK, here's this big-deal writer, this big, macho writer of ""Clockers"" and ""Freedomland."" All of a sudden, you know, his mate says Harlem, and he has to swallow a golf ball.

Then I realized she, Lorraine, had been to Iran, Afghanistan. She's been to Pakistan seven times - always on her own. And now she's with a guy - this big-shot street guy. I was just too embarrassed to say no. So I said OK. And I'm going, all right, what's going to happen? So we rent a house. I go up there. It's the first day. I'm bracing. And I can't get close to my house because there are trailers - movie trailers because they're shooting an episode of ""Sesame Street"" in the house across the street. So that was my first day in Harlem.

DAVIES: Richard Price speaking with Terry Gross, recorded last year. Price's novel, ""The Whites,"" is now out in paperback. After a break, Price will tell a remarkable story about his grandfather, who was locked up in jail a number of times. He'll tell us why. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. We're listening to Terry's interview, recorded last year, with writer Richard Price. His latest novel, ""The Whites,"" is now out in paperback. It's about a police detective in New York who, like a number of cops Price knows, is troubled by a killer who was never prosecuted and got away with the crime. Those cops can't forget - can't let go of those cases. The killers that got away are called the whites, like the white whale Captain Ahab couldnt stop chasing in ""Moby Dick."" Richard Price's other books include ""The Wanderers,"" ""Clockers"" and ""Freedomland,"" which were each adapted into films.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

GROSS: There are several characters, you know, like, the police and the police precinct are characters in your novel, but hospitals are characters, too. One of, you know, the main character - the main detective's wife is a nurse. You describe her as a triage nurse in the St. Anne's knife-and-gun-club ER. And I'm wondering if you've had to spend a lot of time in hospitals for friends, family, for parents.

PRICE: Well, I had an infantile hernia when I was 3, and I was born in a hospital - but not an awful lot. The thing is, if you're going to be a cop that's responding to crime scenes, you're going to wind up in a hospital about three or four times a night talking to victims, talking to the people that brought the victim in, talking to the doctors, talking to the witnesses. Every time I went out with night watch, I saw some of the finer and some of the grimier ERs in Manhattan. It's just the nature of the job. You know, you're responding to felonies. You're responding to violence. You're going to wind up in the hospital 'cause that's where your victim is, invariably. I mean, that's just the nature of the job, and to not acknowledge that would be to leaving out a huge chunk of what a night watch cop's job is.

The other thing is that in my experience - I'm not a sociologist, but I would say so many cops are married to nurses, and it's just the way it is. It's - you know, mom's a nurse, dad's a cop, or mom and dad are cops. Rarely are mom and dad, you know, doctor, nurses. And you know what? You talk about meeting cute - you know, that's where they're going to meet their spouses, you know, following up a homicide, following up an aggravated assault, you know? And you go to the same hospital maybe three times a week for a couple of months, you get to know these people, and they get to know you pretty well. And it's kind of like this medical courtship around mayhem.

GROSS: The last time you were on FRESH AIR, which was about five years ago, after the publication of your novel, ""Lush Life,"" which was set in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, you mentioned that your grandfather was locked up a number of times on the Lower East Side of Manhattan for violent crimes. And somehow I think I neglected to ask you the follow-up question - what crimes? So I'm going to ask you today. What crimes?

PRICE: Well, first of all, I might have been a little romantic and mythical about my grandfather. You know, he wasn't a killer. He wasn't a - he was a poor kid in a ghetto neighborhood of the Lower East Side. And all the poor kids, just like today, they idolized the gangsters. And he idolized the gangsters in his environment, and he started running with them. And he was a gofer for them, and one time he was collared for - he had to hide a gun after a murder because he was this 14-year-old gee-whiz kid looking up to his gods, who were 17, in the pool hall. And they said, hey, Artie, do me favor. Keep this shoebox in your closet. And he - and they said don't open it, which, if that was me, the first thing I'd do is open it. But anyways, so he just came home from peddling shoelaces on the street, he told me that one day. And his tenement apartment was flooded with cops, and they had a murder weapon and he had it. So he went away for that when he was in his - and he's also a guy who thought with his hands, you know? He was kind of like an emotional - he was a violent mama's boy in a way, where he was very sentimental and he - he just liked to fight, you know? And he liked an opportunity to prove himself, and it got him into some bad situations. And there was a time - during the Depression, he was a poultry truck driver coming out of the Hunts Point Terminal delivering chickens to Chinese restaurants. And he was fired by his boss because he took two chicks home for my mother who was probably 6 at the time. And the boss fired him, and he went down to this poultry wholesaling place, which used to be on 14th Street, you know, to beg for his boss to, you know, take him back. And the boss not only didn't take him back, but he said you're blackballed out of this industry. You'll never work again. And my grandfather lost it and beat the guy to an inch of his death. He just broke all his ribs. He was just going insane, you know, and he was spirited out of there, you know, by other guys that he knew on the job. But he was arrested in his home, and he went to a cop in the Bronx - in South Bronx - southeast Bronx. This was Vyse Avenue for those who live there.

Anyways, and he begged the cop if he could help him out. And the cop said to him, well, here's what's going to happen. You're going to go in front of a judge. The judge is going to throw the book at you. He's going to scream and curse you out, you know, for the subhuman that you are. You're going to be steered towards the door - a side door - and you're going to go out in cuffs through that side door, and that's what's going to happen. My grandfather went there. The guy he beat up was there. He was wearing an entire body cast like, you know, something out of a Mel Brooks movie with just the middle finger exposed. And the judge, you know, tore him a new one, sentenced him. He went out that door in cuffs. The minute he was out the door, he realized he was in an alley. And one second later, this cop, who was behind him, booted him in the behind so hard that he went off the ground - both feet. And the cop, after that, uncuffed him and said, if you ever make me do this for you again, I'm going to say to hell with you.

GROSS: So who told you the story? Was it your grandfather or your parents?

PRICE: My grandfather. I had a - at the end of my grandfather's life he was in - he was 86. My second daughter was just born. I realized my grandfather's not going to be around forever. And so I went to him, and I had a tape recorder. And I said, gramps, just tell me the stories again. He's been telling - I know these stories, but I wanted to have his voice. I wanted - for my kids - I wanted them to have their great-grandfather's voice that propelled me to be a writer - all these stories. And they're always working-class stories. They're always ghetto stories. And he didn't want to do it, but he did it. And he talked for two hours - every bad thing that ever happened to him. And it was all bad. It was just, you know, hard-luck Charlie stories. And he would be crying. He would be choked up about things that happened to him in 1917. And I was so tormented by making my grandfather - at the age of 86 - relive this stuff for hours. When he finally finished, I thanked him profusely and I went to turn off the tape recorder and realized I never pushed play.

GROSS: Oh, no.

PRICE: Yeah. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

GROSS: Wow. Oh, that's heartbreaking.

PRICE: Well, it's...

GROSS: And then you couldn't - you felt like you couldn't put him through it a second time?

PRICE: No, I would never, after three hours, just say, listen, we're going to do a second take on the next three hours. It'll probably kill you. But, you know what? It's good for the kids. I want them to have this. So, you know...

GROSS: (Laughter) Oh, that's a shame. That's really a shame. But I didn't realize what an influence your grandfather was on your storytelling and your subject matter.

PRICE: Well, what happened was, my grandfather - that grandfather was an influence on me because of the drama in his life and the ways that both my grandparents had of telling stories - what happened to them. That was my maternal grandfather who had all these events in his life that were just, to me - to the little version of me - were just mind-blowing. And I never forgot. I loved hearing them again and again.

My other grandfather, who had no stories, was a Jew that immigrated as a teenager from Russia, worked as a foreman in a chrome plating factory for a living and was literate and read, you know, basically - I had somebody in my family who read all the great Russians in Russian. He was involved in the Yiddish theater as a stagehand. And I would see when I was a kid that he would write these poems in Yiddish that - was it Yiddish or Russian? I'm not even sure. It was probably Yiddish because my father would do the translating. And they'd show up in these mimeographed YMHA, you know, Brooklyn regional journals. You know, it was just this poem, and it said Morris Price. And it made an enormous impression on me. I was, like, 8 or 9 at the time. And my father was in awe of my grandfather. He really looked up to him as a learned man. And, you know, I wanted some of that. I wanted to be that guy that my father would be in awe of. So - and I always say, you know, listen, it's a good thing my grandfather wasn't a Mexican wrestler

GROSS: (Laughter) But, you know...

PRICE: You know, by Mexican, you know - el diablo, I mean.

GROSS: But it's interesting because your parents didn't have faith that you could become a writer, not because of your lack of ability but because people didn't become writers. But your grandfather was a writer.

PRICE: In their world, you know, writers are mostly coming from more comfortable backgrounds - that the family is more professional. They're not so haunted by the fact that their kid might have a number of years driving a cab, you know, that the kid themselves will feel like, you know, I've been taken care of all my life. I'm going to be OK. I have the confidence to, you know, experiment for a couple of years of my life before I go to law school, you know, if I have go to law school. That's not true on the working-class level. It was sheer panic.

GROSS: Did your grandfather who wrote ever get to read your work?

PRICE: You know what? He died before my first novel, and I dedicated it to him. And to this day I always think about - I'm at the age where you really start thinking about the people in your family who are no longer there and you're dying. You wish you could just have one more good conversation with them. You know, you weren't curious enough when you were a kid because it was your everyday living life. And you never asked the questions that became important to you once they were gone and you were older and had become more reflective. So, yeah, it always galls me - not galls me, but, you know, I feel really sad that my grandfather never lived to see my book. Then again, he might not have liked it because it had dirty words in it.

DAVIES: Richard Price's novel, ""The Whites,"" is now out in paperback. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're listening to Terry's interview with Richard Price. His novel, ""The Whites,"" is now out in paperback.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

GROSS: How were your parents' lives changed by your success?

PRICE: Yeah, a lot. I mean, the irony is that when you come from a working-class family, such as I did in the Bronx - where my father was a cab driver and a small store window dresser. My mother was a housewife. She had a tiny hosiery store. Later on, she was a bank teller. And these are people that were born in the '20s, and they grew up haunted by the Depression. And they never had children that surpassed them and actually went to college and had some real options out in the world. So they couldn't understand the fact that I wanted to be a writer because there's no job coming. You know, there's no context, and there's no security to validate your kid wanting to be something in the arts when you grew up struggling. So they were totally upset that I didn't take the job at Blue Cross management trainee program, which was offered to me when I graduated 'cause I wanted to go to Columbia and study just fiction workshops for two years. And it was very hard for them to accept. And when I had success after that, they were poleaxed. They weren't poleaxed 'cause they didn't have confidence in me, but they were poleaxed that something like this can work. And they, like myself, they were kind of knocked over by my success. You know, to - every time I saw my father up until his 80s, he would look at me and just say, we didn't know.

GROSS: (Laughter).

PRICE: You know, in that plaintiff, kind of shrugging-your-shoulders, like, what do you want? We didn't know. We did our best. I think - it wasn't like they didn't have confidence in me. They didn't have confidence in the situation, and they were very protective and anxious that I wouldn't wind up being a ditch digger.

GROSS: Did your success change their standard of living?

PRICE: I helped them out, yeah. It just - I mean, they were very comfortable and social people, but yeah, I helped them out financially, just enough to, you know, to keep them not looking over their shoulder for the wolf. Yeah, I changed their - you know, and you know, they're parents. They're proud.

GROSS: So you're 65 now. Do you ever think about when your parents were 65, and what you thought 65 meant?

PRICE: Oh, of course. The older you get, the more you hate arithmetic.

GROSS: (Laughter).

PRICE: You know, so - OK, when they were 65, I was like 59 or - no, I mean...

GROSS: No. (Laughter).

PRICE: You know, they're also the generation where they got young and had kids in their - you know, by the time everybody was 25. You know, I waited till I was - I think my first daughter was born when I was 37. You know, 65 meant cemetery when I was growing up. Somebody was 65 - they were my grandmother's grandmother, you know. And they were shapeless, and they would toddle from foot to foot and let gravity kick in for forward momentum. I mean, 65, to me, was George Washington if he was still alive. Yeah, but - and they say - well, I want to tell you something. This is what I've discovered, Terry. Sixty-five is the new 64.

GROSS: (Laughter) Well, probably when you are very young, you thought 65 was a world where the people in your family spoke Yiddish.

PRICE: No. No, people - my family spoke English, but they were fluent in Yiddish.

GROSS: Right.

PRICE: And whenever they started talking Yiddish, it was something I wasn't allowed to hear.

GROSS: Yes.

PRICE: And so, of course, I'm going what does that mean? What does that mean? I remember there was a bawdy female comedian named Belle Barth, and she had all these naughty albums - comedy albums. And so I'd be laying in bed. My parents and their friends would be in the living room, and they'd be listening to Belle Barth jokes. And it would be something like, well, you know, the rabbi, you know, went to the beach and was on the beach next to the nun. It got really hot, and the nun took off her top. And it got really hot, and the rabbi took off his bottom. And the nun got really hot and took off her bottom. And then the rabbi turns to the nun and says (unintelligible). It was in Yiddish.

GROSS: (Laughter).

PRICE: I going crazy. I was just running out in my Davy Crockett pajamas. What did the rabbi say? You know, but that's the story of my life in Yiddish.

GROSS: (Laughter) So you've been quoted as saying what you really want to do most - that you write for TV, you do movies - but what you really want to do is write novels. And I'm thinking much as I love your novels, why would you be so insistent on writing novels in an age when fewer and fewer people, sadly, read them?

PRICE: Well, it's all that crap. The novel is dead. You know, cable took over, you know, the novel's purpose. It's just a bunch of nonsense. You know, the novel will outlive us all - will be at our funeral.

And of all the art forms for a storyteller, everyone that pays better - screenplays, TV - there's a committee over your head that determines what you're supposed to do. You are basically writing for them to feel like, yeah, this is marketable. We can get a maximum audience for this. When I'm writing my books, nobody tells me anything. You know, if I trust my editor and have a rapport with my editor, I listen. And with my current editor, John Sterling, I listen very hard. He was the editor for me for ""Clockers"" and ""Freedomland."" But I'm free. I'm free to write what I want. I don't have to worry about whether people in Montana, you know, are going to tune into my novel. You know, it's just me writing about what I know the best way I can, answering to no one.

GROSS: Well, keep writing, please. Richard Price, it's such a pleasure to talk with you. Thank you so much for coming back to the show.

PRICE: Oh, you're welcome.

No matter where you are in Tucson, Ariz., you're no more than 20 miles from Saguaro National Park. The park and its tall, pronged, namesake cactus literally surround Tucson. There's the rounded top of the park's cactus-studded Wasson Peak to the west, the park's desert-to-forest Rincon Mountain Range to the east and about a million people living between.

But if you go around Tucson  to its historic barrio neighborhoods, swap meets or hiking trails  and ask people about their neighboring national park, you might be surprised.

""Saguaro High School?""

""I have no idea.""

""What's that?""

Darla Sidles, Saguaro National Park's superintendent, is not surprised by those responses. She knows better than most the disconnect that exists between a lot of locals here and the park next door. ""The type of people that are coming to the park versus the people just five minutes away in Tucson is really an issue for us here,"" she says.

The reason: The type of people that are coming to the park don't reflect the type of people living in the community. Tucson is about 44 percent Hispanic or Latino. Of the park's roughly 650,000 annual visitors, less than 2 percent self-identify as Hispanic. ""If we're not being relevant to almost half of the population, then 30, 40, 50 years from now, the park isn't going to matter to them,"" Sidles says.

A Call To Action

The disconnect between Tucson's minority populations and Saguaro National Park is striking given their proximity, but it's hardly unique.

The National Park Service overall has a diversity problem. There were a record 307.2 million visits to U.S. national parks in 2015, and it's fair to say that the majority of those visitors were white. The National Park Service doesn't track the demographics of its visitors, but the most recent survey commissioned by the Park Service to see how different populations groups related to the parks found that 9 percent of American visitors were Hispanic. African-Americans accounted for 7 percent. Asian-Americans were 3 percent. Collectively, minorities made up just over 20 percent of the visitors to national parks, despite the fact that they made up nearly 40 percent of the U.S. population.

toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR

""We know that visitation does not reflect the diversity of the nation,"" says Jon Jarvis, the director of the National Park Service. ""And that's a concern.""

It's a concern on multiple levels. For one, the national parks depend on public money, political support and community engagement for funding. The Census Bureau is projecting that non-whites will make up the majority of the U.S. population within the next 25 years. Urbanization is growing. And millennials are now the biggest generation in history. Add that all up and it's not hard to predict that multicultural, mostly-urban millennials ""will assume all seats of power and responsibilities for the nation,"" Jarvis says. ""So connecting to that generation is essential to the Park Service's ability to thrive in our second century.""

The other reason it's important to connect to all of America's shifting demographics, Jarvis says, is it's the Park Service's job. ""The Park Service has a responsibility that Congress and the president have granted us over our history,"" he says.

To that end, Jarvis has made increasing diversity at the national parks a top priority as the Park Service approaches its centennial. His Call to Action plan  a vision for the organization's future  states: ""In our second century, we will fully represent our nation's ethnically and culturally diverse communities.""

'This Is Not Your Space'



Figuring out why there's a disconnect between Tucson's minority groups and Saguaro National Park is about to be Cam Juarez's job. Juarez, from Tucson, is a leader in the Hispanic community serving on the city's school board. In a couple of weeks, he's going to start working for Saguaro National Park as their outreach coordinator.

toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR

Juarez getting a jump start on that by visiting a couple of schools in Tucson to ask parents, teachers, administrators and students if they know about Saguaro and, if not, why. He's also going to try to get them interested in the park and what it has to offer. ""It's like we're out there selling snake oil,"" he says on the way to a charter school in south Tucson, which is predominantly Hispanic. ""I'd wager to say that there's a whole lot of folks here that don't use the park, close as they are to it.""

In a way, Juarez is the perfect person for this job because he can relate. To date, he says, he's visited three national parks, including Saguaro. Growing up, his family never went to national parks. They never even talked about it. ""It just wasn't something we did,"" he says.

His family was poor. ""We didn't have camping gear or fishing gear,"" he says. ""We had hoes and shovels; work implements and school books.""

Even as he got older, Juarez says, he thought of national parks as a place for ""folks that were white or folks that had resources and sometimes you likened them to each other."" Either way, he didn't think the parks were for people like him.

He's not alone in that sentiment. That survey of park visitors released in 2011 found that non-whites were three times more likely to say that parks provide poor service and are not safe places to visit. And Juarez heard some of that at the schools he went to.

Oscar Medina, a teacher at Changemaker High School, talked about how he visited a park with his family ""and none of the information signs were in Spanish."" A mom at Carrillo Intermediate talked about how she wanted to go to Saguaro with her family, but there weren't facilities for a large group. Another pointed out there's no public transportation.

Some of the reasons were universal: the cost is prohibitive; not enough time because of work; the lack of shade in a desert park.

i toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR

Others were more subtle. Luis Perales, the chief academic officer at Changemaker High School, says that the reasons minorities, and particularly Latinos, aren't going to national parks is that ""spaces either are inviting or are rejecting in many ways. And I think a lot of what's been created [with national parks] is this idea that this is not your space.""

It's not that Latinos don't want to go outside. Go to any park or hiking trail in Tucson and you'll see that's not the case. It's that they might want to have a different experience in the outdoors. A lot of what the national parks promote is the solitude and quiet of a John Muir photo. ""Go out on your own, enjoy nature, don't harm it,"" Perales says. That messaging of ""rugged individualism"" doesn't necessarily work with Latinos, Perales says. ""It's like no, I'm going to bring my whole family, we're going to be loud, we're going to explore,"" he says. ""That's not what's promoted at this point. It has to be a compromise.""

'Reflect The Face Of The People We Want To Attract'

There's another reason that people gave for not feeling connected or welcome at the national parks, and it's one that many people danced around. Bella Furr, an intern and temporary worker at Saguaro National Park had no such qualms: ""The other thing is the Park Service is full of white men.""

That's not entirely accurate, but it's not far off the mark. According to the most recent survey, 80 percent of Park Service's roughly 22,000 employees are white. Anecdotally, people involved with the Park Service say, the demographics breakdown of the Park Service's estimated 220,000 volunteers is similar.

At Saguaro National Park, Sidles estimates about 75 percent of their workforce is white. ""We don't have as diverse a staff as we should have,"" she says. ""We have to reflect the face of the people we want to attract.""

That idea of reflecting the diversity of the public in its workforce is one the National Park Service has been pushing for a long time. Programs have been in put place nationally and initiatives have been launched, but little has changed. That's bred some cynicism about the service's efforts in some quarters. One former long-time National Park Service employee interviewed for this story not-so-jokingly said that the National Park Service could also be celebrating the centennial of its efforts to be more diverse.

There's a myriad of reasons park managers and officials give for the slow rate of change. There's the labyrinthian federal job application system as well as preferential hiring mandates that can keep the resumes of diverse, local candidates off of hiring manager's desks. More directly, there's low job turnover and few new opportunities for diverse candidates. With baby boomers nearing retirement though, that's expected to change and open opportunities for more diversity.

i toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR

Saguaro National Park wants to be ready for that opportunity and being ready means having young, diverse, experienced candidates for jobs as they come open. That's why they've partnered with the nonprofit group Friends of Saguaro National Park to hire a group of young locals like Yesenia Gamez on temporary contracts.

Gamez is what's called a Next Generation Ranger. She works at Saguaro National Park's visitor centers and in its interior, but she also works in Tucson, visiting local schools and working at information stands at local events.

On a recent weekend, she showed off a big bleached grizzly bear skull to a group of young kids at community health event at a park in downtown Tucson. They guessed what animal it was.

Gamez says she loves doing events like this because she gets to interact with people who otherwise don't get to experience the park. ""People that come to the park are usually retirees who can drive out there,"" she says. ""This is a low socioeconomic thing. It's in the heart of Tucson. It's kind of like we're bringing the park to them.""

By doing that, she says, the Next Gen Rangers can provide a friendly, familiar face and appeal to people where they're comfortable. They can also tell younger versions of themselves about the opportunities that exist in the National Park Service  if those opportunities exist.",[]
npr.org,2016-03-09 00:00:00,U.S. Hopes ISIS Prisoner Will Lead Americans To Chemical Weapons : The Two-Way : NPR,[],"U.S. Hopes ISIS Prisoner Will Lead Americans To Chemical Weapons

The Pentagon hopes an ISIS chemical weapons engineer captured in Iraq last month will lead U.S. troops to possible weapons sites and help prevent chemical attacks by the Islamic State.

Defense officials hope that Sleiman Daoud al-Afari will help them find storage sites for chemical munitions including mustard agent, which can blister the skin and lungs and lead to death in high concentrations. Iraqi officials told the Associated Press that al-Afari worked for Saddam Hussein's military and has long been a member of ISIS, which seized portions of Iraq last summer.

Al-Afari's capture has already led to some U.S. airstrikes against suspected ISIS chemical weapons stockpiles, one U.S. national security official confirmed to NPR.

Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis declined to confirm the capture of al-Afari but he talked about the chemical threat in general terms.

""We've said before that they have used chemical weapons in both Iraq and Syria, sulphur mustard specifically,"" Davis said. Anyone who's making and using weapons of mass destruction, particularly a terrorist group like ISIL, would be well advised to know that we don't intend to let them keep doing that.""

Al-Afari was captured as part of a new strategy in which Army Delta Force special operators go after Islamic State leaders with the goal of bringing them in and interrogating them about the terror group's operations. American officials are questioning al-Afari but they do not plan to detain him; they expect him to be handed over to Iraqi custody.

Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the capture and interrogation of al-Afari showed Washington's new approach in Iraq is already paying off.

""While these on-the-ground captures pose real dangers to our troops and can risk bringing the U.S. more fully into this conflict, the rewards can be great in terms of vital intelligence collected, ISIS operations disrupted, and attacks thwarted  including those which may involve chemical weapons,"" he said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Kurdish officials in northern Iraq reported that this week some 40 civilians suffered from skin irritation and choking after mortar shells with ""poisonous substances"" were fired into a village south of Kirkuk, which is under Kurdish control.

And separately, Syrian Kurdish officials say jihadists on Tuesday used phosphorous in a chemical attack on the city of Aleppo. Five people remain hospitalized.

There have been numerous reports since last summer of chemical weapons use by ISIS and other jihadi groups. Some of the chemicals have been stolen from old military stockpiles, while others amount to a homemade brew. Also, there is an abundance in Syria and Iraq of chlorine, which is used as a water purifier but can also be weaponized by placing high concentrations into an artillery shell.

Last August, NPR reported on an artillery attack on a village just south of the Iraqi city of Mosul, sickening Kurdish troops.

And recently, on the CBS News show 60 Minutes, CIA Director John Brennan was asked by reporter Scott Pelley about the use of chemical weapons by ISIS:

""Scott Pelley: Does ISIS have chemical weapons? ""John Brennan: We have a number of instances where ISIL has used chemical munitions on the battlefield. ""Scott Pelley: Artillery shells. ""John Brennan: Sure. Yeah. ""Scott Pelley: ISIS has access to chemical artillery shells? ""John Brennan: Uh-huh (affirm). There are reports that ISIS has access to chemical precursors and munitions that they can use.""

With ISIS under continual pressure by U.S. airstrikes and local forces, officials said, there are concerns that ISIS could turn more to the use of chemical weapons in desperation.",[]

Resident Connie Sawyer, 103, has lived here since 2004. She got into show business when she was 8. ""I worked in vaudeville and nightclubs. I played every saloon in the business,"" she says. She was in a Broadway show called A Hole in the Head, which caught the attention of one of Frank Sinatra's managers. Sawyer says the manager told Sinatra, "" 'You gotta buy that property. It'll make a wonderful movie.' He said, 'Buy it! Bring the author.' "" But the author wouldn't go without Sawyer, who created her stage character  a funny, tipsy gal who got lots of laughs. So the manager called Sinatra back and, according to Sawyer, ""He said, 'Bring the drunk!' ""

Today, Sawyer is still working  she did a Super Bowl ad for Dodge last year. She says the secret of her longevity is ""Move. Don't sit on the couch. All my life, I played golf, I swam. And even here, I go to the exercise class.""

Sawyer takes special swim classes for her arthritis in a pool Jodie Foster contributed to the campus. (Water therapy helped the actress' mother, and she wanted to help others.)

The Motion Picture and Television Fund is home to 200-plus residents who once worked on screen, behind cameras, in production rooms and in secretarial pools  industry people in an extremely fickle industry. Fund President Bob Beitcher says most were freelancers.

""They might be working on [a] TV series that [is] supposed to be 13 episodes; six weeks into it, it gets canceled, they're out of work,"" he says. ""They work in a feature film, feature films end and then they're out of work. So it really is an industry where you never know what lies in your future.""

The founders of the fund, some of film's greatest early stars, decided to create some stability. In 1921, they formed a fund so working industry folks could make contributions to those without work.

""That was the vision of Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith,"" Beitcher says. ""And they say that if you worked on a Mary Pickford picture, she had a little galvanized bucket on the set with a little flag on it and if you were lucky enough to be working that day, she expected you to drop something in the bucket to reflect your gratitude for getting paid for the work.""

They might be working on [a] TV series that [is] supposed to be 13 episodes; six weeks into it, it gets canceled, they're out of work. They work in a feature film, feature films end and then they're out of work.

All these years later, the industry still pitches in. Fund chairman and DreamWorks Animation head Jeffrey Katzenberg has raised about half a billion dollars in the past 23 years. The money supports thousands of industry people in need, including residents who can't afford the $3,000 to $8,000 monthly fee. It also pays for health centers that care for industry people all around LA.

Ken Scherer, CEO of the Motion Picture and Television Fund foundation, says many facilities on campus are named for the film giants who endowed them, like Kirk Douglas.

""He would tour the Alzheimer's unit that he helped build, and then he would come and have dinner,"" Scherer says. ""And inevitably a resident would walk up and say to Kirk Douglas, 'You were in my last picture.' Now that person could've been a grip [lighting and rigging technician], but in his head, Kirk Douglas worked on his picture.""

Film and TV giants have also used the campus' facilities  Norma Shearer and Mary Astor lived there. Hattie McDaniel died there, and comedian Bud Abbott came in for physical therapy.

More recently, a meeting at the campus was almost movielike: TV writer Tony Lawrence, 87, moved to the campus 11 years ago with his wife, Nancy, who had Alzheimer's. They had been married 50 years when she died. ""And that's why it was so astonishing and such a miracle to find ... someone like Madi in my life,"" he says.

Madi is Madeline Smith, 75, a former NBC administrative assistant who moved to the campus in 2014. A year later, she and Lawrence got married in the rose garden. On the couch in their small cottage, the newlyweds sit so close together you couldn't fit a piece of paper between them. This is what, in showbiz, you'd call a happy ending. Especially since neither wanted to move here.

""I thought, 'Oh no, this is a bunch of old people. I don't want to live here,' "" Smith recalls

npr.org,,"If Weve Bleeped It, Do We Also Need To Warn Listeners? Maybe Not",[],"If Weve Bleeped It, Do We Also Need To Warn Listeners? Maybe Not

Is it necessary to alert listeners that theres offensive/disturbing/troubling/etc. language in a report if weve already bleeped the nettlesome word or words?

The short answer is, not always.

Previous guidance has been too strict on this point. Lets try this:

If its been decided after discussions with senior editors that a word or phrase will be bleeped, dont assume listeners do or do not need to be alerted. Instead, consider the context.

 Is the cut still intense, graphic or disturbing even after its been bleeped? Then a heads up for listeners could be warranted. By the way, it may not have to be a line that sounds like a warning. The language can be conversational and informational (more on that below).

 Is the cut funny and a naughty word or two are said in jest? Then a heads up probably isnt necessary.

 Is it one bleep in an otherwise family-friendly piece and the word wasnt said in anger? Then, again, there could be no need for a heads up.

Basically, its a judgment call. Talk to the deputy managing editors (Chuck Holmes & Gerry Holmes) and/or the standards & practices editor (Mark Memmott). It will get figured out.

Two related notes:

 Heres the part about being conversational and informational. If we think listeners should be alerted, we dont always need to say something like we should warn you. On Morning Edition recently, there was a piece about the comic Chris Gethard. Two F-bombs were bleeped. In the introduction, David Greene said of Gethard that, Chris is funny and weird. But he doesnt shock audiences. Youll only hear a couple of bleeps this morning. That told listeners something about Gethard and tipped them off to what was coming without saying they needed to be on guard.

 Any time theres bleeped language in a piece, the DACS line must tell stations what that word is, when it appears (or approximately if were still editing) and that it will be bleeped. Obviously, on the occasions when we dont bleep offensive language, the DACS need to explain that.

Pat Conroy, adopted son of the South Carolina low country has died. The novelist who wrote nearly a dozen books, including ""The Prince Of Tides"" and ""The Great Santini,"" was 70. Just last month, he announced he had pancreatic cancer.

Conroy's books sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, and four of them were made into movies. ""The Prince Of Tides"" stared Nick Nolte and Barbra Streisand and earned Conroy an Oscar nomination for his work on the screenplay.

The boy stood on the burning deck. The highwayman came riding, riding, riding. I can still hear her voice.

She read - ""Gone with the Wind"" was the first novel she ever read to me. In her genius in reading that novel was being able to take players in that novel and compare them to people in our own life.

Melanie Wilkes was my tacky Aunt Helen (ph), who lived in Orlando. And she'd have Frank Kennedy as my Uncle Joe (ph), who lived in Jacksonville. Naturally, she took on the role of Scarlett O'Hara. And that swashbuckling figure of a man was Rhett Butler - was my father, who was fighting in warplanes in Korea at that time.

And she gave me, you know, I think my first clues that there was a relationship between life and art that was very close. And you just had to pay attention to find it.

SCOTT SIMON, BYLINE: I have to tell you, Pat - and I say this being a Chicagoan like your father - to some of us, ""Gone With The Wind"" is about the death of a civilization that richly deserved to die.

CONROY: Of course. It is. And it did. But here's what I like about it, Scott.

SIMON: Yeah.

CONROY: A girl from the place who lost outwrote all you Yankee boys and girls who wrote about the victors.

SIMON: As long as we keep the victories literary (laughter), I guess that's all right.

CONROY: You don't want it to be politically, and you don't want slavery. And I was just surprised when I went back to read it how extraordinarily good it was.

SIMON: You know, Pat, it's inescapable that - obviously, I mean, you've written a book about - you've written, I think in a number of places, including this book, that when you were growing up, you were - you thought your father might kill you and your family. And you were actually glad when he went off to war because it meant...

CONROY: I used to pray for war against places like Vatican City. I didn't care where it was, but if it would get him in the sky over some country that wasn't near me...

SIMON: Yeah. And did that - so therefore, did you find a kind of refuge in reading?

CONROY: There's no question. Dad would not hit you if he saw you reading. He thought you were studying. And it was the one time - you know, one place you could go to get away from his fists. And it worked every time.

The New York Times is reviewing some of its reporting about the San Bernardino terrorist couple, Washington Post media blogger Erik Wemple writes. The Times is looking back at a story that said Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik had talked openly on social media about her views on violent jihad.

The Times is examining the story and the anonymous sourcing for that claim because the FBI says it has not found any public social media postings by Farook and Malik that might have tipped off authorities to the couples extremist views, as The Two-Way writes. Instead, it looks like the couple communicated via emails and private messages.

Whether the communications were public or private is important. Wemple calls it a gigantic deal because the Times story went on to say that American immigration officials failed to uncover what Ms. Malik had made little effort to hide  that she talked openly on social media about her views on violent jihad. Thats a damning conclusion if the couple had been communicating in the open. If they werent doing that, the story went too far.

But this Memmo isnt just about what the Times did. Its about what NPR did.

Carrie Johnson, Dina Temple-Raston, Phil Ewing, Martin Kaste, Nathan Rott, Richard Gonzalez, Matt Guilhem, the Two-Way team, the Newscast desk and everyone else who touched the story* stuck to what we were confident we could say and avoided things that werent solid. They were precise in their language. For example, we were careful to say federal sources were telling NPR that Malik had posted a message on Facebook at the time of the shooting. That information has held up.

Most writers would give everything they own to have just one masterpiece to their name. British author Helen Oyeyemi is barely 31, and she already has at least three of them. That includes her last two novels, Mr. Fox and Boy, Snow, Bird, both of which received extensive critical acclaim in the U.S. and around the world.

It also includes her latest book, the short story collection What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours. The book contains the same sly humor, gorgeous writing and magical characters as her previous efforts. It is, in a word, flawless.

The nine stories in the book are mostly linked  characters in early stories show up in later ones, to wonderful effect. And the stories are all joined thematically; each one has a lock or key as a significant plot point. The result is that the book feels like a novel, but one that moves freely through time and geography.

The collection opens with ""Books and Roses,"" a remarkable love story about Montserrat, a foundling girl left in a Catalonia chapel with a key hanging around her neck. She grows up and finds work in a laundry, where she encounters Senora Lucy, a painter who also wears a key. Montserrat eventually discovers that she and Lucy are linked when she finds the lock that fits her key. Her reaction is bittersweet: ""She'd carried the key to this place for so long and now that she was there she didn't know where she was.""

In ""'Sorry' Doesn't Sweeten Her Tea"" (Oyeyemi clearly has a gift for great titles), sisters Day and Aisha, who are being raised by their father and his boyfriend, deal with the news that their favorite singer has been accused of savagely beating a woman. Day returns later in the funny, deeply sweet ""A Brief History of the Homely Wench Society,"" as a member of the titular club, formed at Cambridge University as an answer to an all-male student association.

Aisha, as well as some other characters from previous stories, is featured in ""Freddy Barrandov Checks ... In?"", about a young man being pressured to work in the hotel that employs his parents. Freddy is resistant to the idea: ""She wants to see good hearts and good brains put to proper use, but I'm not convinced that everybody ought to live like that, or even that everybody can.""

Oyeyemi seems to be incapable of writing anything that's not wholly original. ""Is Your Blood As Red As This?"" follows the lives of students at a bizarre puppetry school; one character is a ghost, and another, Rowan, is a ""wooden devil"" in genderless human form. ""No matter how soft his skin appears to be he is entirely wooden, and it is not known exactly what animates him  no clock ticks in his chest,"" Oyeyemi writes. ""His fellow students already had all those confusing hormone surges to deal with. So most of them stayed away, though I'm sure they all dreamed of him, her, hir, zir, a body with a tantalizing abundance of contours, this Rowan who is everything but mostly tree.""

It's one thing to write so beautifully about youth and desire; it's another thing entirely to do it in such a vividly imagined, unique setting. Oyeyemi manages to make the story both realistic and fantastical, and the characters are rendered with grace and compassion.

You could say the same thing for every story in What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours, from the subtle ""Presence"" to the chilling ""If a Book Is Locked There's Probably a Good Reason for That Don't You Think."" And even in the darkest moments of the book, Oyeyemi never loses her sense of humor  as one character notes, ""Sometimes I dream I'm falling, and it's not so much frightening as it is tedious, just falling and falling until I'm sick of it, but then a noose stops me short and I think, well, at least I'm not falling anymore.""

What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours is a lot of things: dreamy, spellbinding, and unlike just about anything you can imagine. It's a book that resists comparisons; Oyeyemi's talent is as unique as it is formidable. It's another masterpiece from an author who seems incapable of writing anything that's less than brilliant.",[]

Frozen in Time An Epic Story of Survival and a Modern Quest for Lost Heroes of World War II by Mitchell Zuckoff Paperback, 393 pages | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

Lost in Shangri-La A True Story Of Survival, Adventure, And The Most Incredible Rescue Mission Of World War II by Mitchell Zuckoff Paperback, 432 pages | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

Author Sarah Lotz is terrified of flying, so naturally every time she gets on a plane she imagines the worst. ""I imagine how it's going to smell if things start burning,"" she says. ""I imagine the thunk of luggage falling out of the compartments at the top. ... I imagine it all in absolutely horrible detail.""

All those horrible imaginings came in handy when Lotz was writing her new book The Three  the story of three children who are the only survivors of four separate plane crashes that occur in different parts of the world on the same day.

Lotz's book is part of a long tradition of travel disaster stories. After all, travel tales don't often end well: Planes crash into dense jungles and frozen tundras. Shipwreck victims spend months in rickety boats on the high seas. Survivors are stranded on far-flung islands and must overcome terrible odds.

Indeed you could think of Odysseus' long journey home in The Odyssey as just one travel disaster after another, says Eric Wilson, author of Everyone Loves a Train Wreck.

Odysseus endures ""just one test after another of his mettle,"" Wilson explains. ""Is he wily enough, is he crafty enough, is he strong enough, is he brave enough ... and the answer in all cases is yes!""

Travel disasters typically thrust people into extreme conditions. Not only is their bravery tested, but so is their moral fortitude. Mitchell Zuckoff has written about real-life stories of travelers stranded in remote locations in his books Lost in Shangri-La and Frozen in Time. He says people get a vicarious thrill reading about such perilous adventures from the safety of their homes. But it also makes them think: ""We all fly, we all get on boats  if the worst happened, how would I react? That fascinates me,"" says Zuckoff.

One of Zuckoff's favorites is A Night to Remember, Walter Lord's account of the sinking of the Titanic, which was made into a film in 1958. Lord based his book on interviews with survivors and included the haunting image of the band that continued to play as the ship went down. But these stories don't end once the ship has sunk or the plane has crashed  often that is just the beginning.

""Most travel disasters turn into something else,"" Zuckoff says, ""a story of survival, a story of bravery, of heroism, sometimes villainy. You just don't know when it starts where it's going to go because they are unexpected events.""

It is usually the survivors who are left to tell the rest of us what really happened. In Lotz's book, the young survivors become the center of a media storm. They are suspected of being aliens or harbingers of the apocalypse.

""There is something about a miracle  for example, surviving an air crash  that to us makes them extremely special,"" Lotz says. ""They've beaten death. That really fascinates us.""

Survivors often find themselves struggling not only with forces of nature but also with each other. In Frozen in Time, Zuckoff's retelling of a cargo plane that crash-landed in Greenland during World War II, the survivors proved to be heroic.

""It was amazing,"" Zuckoff says. "" ... Every guy inside the tail section of that plane felt as though: What can I give to the guy next to me? Can I warm his feet? Can I share my rations? How do I help him survive?""

But survivors can also turn on each other, sometimes savagely, as in the novel Lord of the Flies. Being trapped in an isolated place  or a small space like a lifeboat  with a bunch of strangers can bring out the best or the worst in us, says author Eric Wilson.

""Suddenly they have to work together as a team,"" he says. "" ... There's this idea of extreme behavior where oftentimes the normal guy becomes the hero and oftentimes the seemingly extraordinary guy becomes the goat. And then there's always the possibility of cannibalism. Again, the idea that something extreme is going to happen, and in the extreme context people will learn things about themselves they did not know before.""

Wilson believes writers keep returning to the story of travels gone wrong because there is something immensely satisfying about it.

""When there is danger, when there is destruction, we kind of feel like we're on the edge of life, fully alive,"" he says. ""And that can really bring out some strong prose. And it can allow us to think about some of the great questions in the universe, such as what is the meaning of suffering?""

Sometimes a journey that ends in a disaster can bring the survivor in touch with the sublime. That's literally what happens in James Hilton's Lost Horizon, where survivors of a plane crash in the Himalayas find themselves in a paradise called Shangri-La.

The only problem is ... you'd have to survive a plane crash to get there.",[]

On Super Tuesday Eve, heres a reminder: theres no cheering [or booing] in the press box.

This is very important, so were recirculating the guidance we posted last October about social media. It still applies.

Everyone should be familiar with our thinking:

The presidential campaign ... and breaking news events ... draw many of us to social media. We want to monitor the news, post our reporting, share the interesting information we find and offer our thoughts.

Thats great. Have fun out there.

But ... (theres always a but) ... all of us  journalists as well as those in other departments  need to remember that what we post and retweet can reflect on NPR. None of us want NPRs reputation for fairness to be put in doubt because of things we do on digital platforms.

Our resources:

 The Social Media section of the handbook. The introduction specifically mentions NPRs journalists, but the principles apply to others here as well. If youre in doubt, talk to your supervisor:

The Internet and the social media communities it encompasses can be incredible resources. They offer both a remarkably robust amount of historical material and an incredible amount of real-time reporting from people at the scenes of breaking news events. But they also present new and unfamiliar challenges, and they tend to amplify the effects of any ethical misjudgments you might make. So tread carefully. Conduct yourself online just as you would in any other public circumstances as an NPR journalist. Treat those you encounter online with fairness, honesty and respect, just as you would offline. Verify information before passing it along. Be honest about your intent when reporting. Avoid actions that might discredit your professional impartiality. And always remember, you represent NPR.

 Some Guidance About Social Media On Election Day. You could substitute the words Debate Night [or ""Super Tuesday""] for Election Day.

 Reminder: There Is No Privacy On The Web, And Personal Pages Are Not Safe Zones. Heres a key paragraph:

Matt Thompson offers a test. Before posting something about your work or a news event or an issue, even if youre putting it on what you think of as a personal page, ask this question: Is it helping my journalism, or is it hurting my journalism?

When reporting about or from Myanmar, it is no longer necessary to say at the top that it is Myanmar, also known as Burma, as our style has been since 2011. We feel there are very few in the audience who still need that immediate reminder.

It is also no longer necessary to include the reminder about the name Burma in every report. Use your judgment. In longer pieces, and especially in those tracing the countrys recent history, an also known as Burma is appropriate and helpful.

Meanwhile, our guidance (and APs) has been that Myanmarese is the adjective to use when describing the people of that country. You should know, however, that there is disagreement over whether that is the proper adjectival form and that people in Myanmar do not refer to themselves that way. Many authorities say Burmese is the word to use, even when referring to the country as Myanmar. One way around all that, of course, is to say something such as the people of Myanmar or the people here.

Sir George Martin, the music producer who signed the Beatles to a recording contract in 1962 and was their intimate collaborator as they together transformed popular music, died Tuesday at the age of 90.

Martin's death was confirmed by Adam Sharp, his manager in the U.K. In a statement, Sharp said:

Sir George Martin passed away peacefully at home yesterday evening, Tuesday March 8th. The family would like to thank everyone for their thoughts, prayers and messages of support.

Martin was often referred to as the ""Fifth Beatle."" He scoffed, but the band wouldn't have been the Beatles we know without him.

Martin's 1979 memoir (co-authored with Jeremy Hornsby) was titled All You Need Is Ears  but his ears, and his instincts as a music producer, were extraordinary.

A classically trained composer, George Martin began to work for the British record label EMI's imprint Parlophone Records in 1950, overseeing classical recordings as well as comedy records by the likes of Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Bernard Cribbins.

By 1962, when Cribbins' song ""Right Said Fred"" became a hit in the U.K., George Martin was running Parlophone Records and looking to sign up a rock 'n' roll band. The Beatles auditioned for him in June of 1962.

In a 2011 BBC interview, Martin said: ""They had this wonderful charisma. They made you feel good to be with them. And I thought their music was rubbish.""

Martin signed the Beatles anyway, and came to love their songs. For the rest of the 1960s, he was their closest collaborator, producing almost all of the band's music, playing piano with them, writing their orchestral arrangements and figuring out how to turn John Lennon and Paul McCartney's wilder ideas into records.

In 2011, Martin described how he'd produced one of Lennon's signature songs:

""There was one time on 'Rain' when I decided to play around with tapes, and I took John's voice off as a separate item and put it on a quarter-inch tape and turned it back to front and slid it around a bit and then put it in on the end of the song. And I played it to John when he came back and he said, 'That's gear! What is it?' And I said, 'It's you!' And I explained to him what I'd done. And from that moment he wanted everything backward.""

When he wasn't in the studio with the Beatles, George Martin produced records by British pop acts like Cilla Black, Gerry and the Pacemakers and Shirley Bassey.

In 1977, while visiting the West Indies, Martin fell in love with the island of Montserrat. He built a recording complex for his company AIR Studios there with the money he'd made producing post-Beatles hits like the band America's ""Sister Golden Hair.""

AIR Studios Montserrat was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and Martin gradually retired from recording as hearing loss robbed him of his golden ears. His final hit song was the best-selling single of all time: a year after being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, he produced Elton John's ""Candle in the Wind 1997.""

""As a whole, I've had a wonderful life,"" Martin told the BBC in 1995. ""I've met the most wonderful people, worked with the greatest of artists. I'm very fortunate. I've got no gripes at all.""",[]

The question comes up about once a week: Should we say Islamic or Islamist when referring to fighters from such groups as Boko Haram and the self-proclaimed Islamic State?

Islamist is a noun meaning an advocate or supporter of Islamism  which in turn is defined as a movement advocating the social and political establishment of Islamic fundamentalism.

Compound nouns such as Islamist fighters or Islamist militants describe who we are reporting about because they make the connection to the fundamentalist movement.

Islamic is too general. Its just the adjective formed from the noun Islam.

Steve Inskeep talks to Univision anchor Jorge Ramos about his book, Take A Stand: Lessons From Rebels. Ramos will be one of the moderators at Wednesday's Washington Post-Univision Democratic debate.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Let's meet a journalist who sometimes makes himself part of the story. He's Jorge Ramos. He's an anchor for the Spanish-language network Univision. At a press conference last year, Ramos stood to challenge Donald Trump on his plan to deport millions of immigrants who were here illegally. Trump first refused to call on Ramos and then had security guards remove him.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. Sit down. You weren't called. Sit down. Sit down.

JORGE RAMOS: I have the right to ask a question.

TRUMP: Go back to Univision.

RAMOS: It's the first time in 30 years as a journalist in the United States in which I'd been ejected from a press conference for asking a question. The only other time in which I'd been prevented from asking a question was with Fidel Castro.

INSKEEP: Jorge Ramos was eventually allowed back in at the urging of other reporters. He asked several questions although Trump gave no ground. Early this year Ramos made headlines again. He was the one who interviewed former Mexican President Vicente Fox about Trump's claim that he will make Mexico pay for a great wall on the border. Fox replied...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

VICENTE FOX: I'm not going to pay for that [expletive] wall. He should pay for it. He's got the money.

INSKEEP: Tonight Jorge Ramos is in the spotlight once again. He will moderate a debate among Democrats Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton - a race that once again is intensely interesting. Ramos has interviewed candidates, presidents and other world leaders for decades now. He's about to publish a book about his experience and his view of journalism. It is called ""Take A Stand.""

Do you think of yourself as an advocacy journalist? Is that the right phrase for what you do?

RAMOS: I have been asking if I'm an activist or a journalist. And my answer is very simple. I'm just a journalist who asks questions. The difference is that I'm completely convinced that there are few moments, important moments, in which you have to take a stand as a journalist. When it comes to racism, discrimination, corruption, public lies, dictatorships and human rights, you have to take a stand as a reporter because I think our responsibility as journalist is to confront those who are abusing power. You know, I've been reading a lot about neutrality. Elie Wiesel, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, he says, we must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. In other words, as journalist, I'm completely convinced we have to take a stand sometimes.

INSKEEP: You work through in this book an account of a time that you believed that President Obama was wrong and in fact that you feel he broke a promise that he made in an interview with you regarding immigration reform. What did he say?

RAMOS: He was a candidate 2008. And he said, you know, I cannot promise that I'll propose immigration reform during the first 100 days, but I can do that within one year. And everybody in the Hispanic community call that la promesa de Obama, Obama's promise. And he just didn't keep his word.

INSKEEP: Well, this is an interesting part of this story, though. You assert that that would have made a difference, that had he gone ahead and proposed immigration reform early in his first term that it would have passed. Do you really believe that?

RAMOS: Not only do I believe that, it was so easy to understand. The Senate was controlled by the Democrats. The House was controlled by the Democrats. And they had all the votes. And they waited and waited and waited. If he really didn't mean that he was going to propose immigration reform during his first year in office then he shouldn't have promised that.

INSKEEP: How do you think it has affected your outlook on life that you are one of this very small group of people who can call up almost anybody and talk with them?

RAMOS: You know, I became a journalist - one of the reasons why I became a journalist was because I wanted to be able to talk to the people who are changing the world. And I do learn from powerful people. On the other hand, Oriana Fallaci, the Italian journalist who died recently...

INSKEEP: Right.

RAMOS: He used to say that interviews were a war and that sometimes the interview would win and sometimes the interviewer would win.

INSKEEP: Can you think of an interview where you feel like the interviewee won?

RAMOS: Oh, many times, (laughter) many times. I don't think I win most interviews. For instance, with Fidel Castro, I only spoke with him one minute and three seconds. But I think he won because I couldn't get anything from him. With the former president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, it happened exactly the same thing. And as a Mexican, for me it is incredibly frustrating to talk to the president of Mexico - former presidents of Mexico - because I can't get to them. It is very difficult. On the other hand - I know you'll find this surprising - but it is so refreshing to talk to American presidents because they are much more open than Latin American presidents.

INSKEEP: How many American presidents have you spoken with?

RAMOS: Every U.S. president since George Bush Sr. I have been able to...

INSKEEP: And you found them all relatively open to your questions?

RAMOS: Not relatively open - much more open than to talk to Latin American dictators or Latin American presidents. When you talk to a Latin American president, they make you feel so tiny right from the beginning, right from the moment when they shake your hands. Once I - I'm not going to say exactly in which country - but I asked to go to the bathroom right before the interview and a general followed me all the way to the bathroom...

INSKEEP: (Laughter).

RAMOS: ...And waited outside. But they make you feel you really have no power. And when you have 80 journalists who have been killed in Mexico, for instance, in the last decade, yeah, you realize how lucky we are here in the United States in which you can go to the White House, talk to the president and go back to your house. And then you can take a bike ride and go to the supermarket and no one is going to kill you. No one is going to do anything against you. That's a huge difference.

INSKEEP: So as we're talking, you are preparing for a debate between two would-be presidents - Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.

RAMOS: Right.

INSKEEP: Don't give away your specific questions here. I'm not asking that. But what is the essence of what you want to know from each of those two?

RAMOS: You want to know who they really are and what they believe in. So what I'm going to try to do tonight is to put aside some of the statements that they've said and try to get to know the real candidate, the real person, the person who is behind the candidate, the person who might become the president of the United States. And it's not easy.

INSKEEP: Meaning you might not get them to agree with you but you want to push them to the point were they have to level with you about something?

RAMOS: Exactly, and then if we talk tomorrow and I was not able to put them on the defensive then I didn't do my job.

INSKEEP: Jorge Ramos is the author of ""Take A Stand"" and also of course a longtime anchor for Univision. Thank you very much.

RAMOS: Thank you.

INSKEEP: Jorge Ramos is also moderating tonight's Democratic debate between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.

Shorter frequently revisits some of his earlier compositions. But his objective isn't retrospective, or to recreate his older style. He always makes it a point to try to make his music new again.

""It's almost like as an adult to go outside and play with some other adults like they used to do when they were kids,"" Shorter says.

The man who called himself ""Mr. Weird"" as a kid is a huge film buff and loves science fiction. He's also a practicing Nichiren Buddhist, and that pushes him forward too.

""Hon Nim Myo,"" Shorter says. ""It means from this moment, from this moment forward is the first day of my life. And don't, we don't lie and sit on accolades and rewards and awards and what-do-you-call-it, trophies, Grammys and this and that and bank accounts and fame and all that. That's the worst kind of fuel that you can rely on. The best kind of fuel that you can rely on is Hon Nim Myo. You start from now.""

In this episode of Jazz Night In America, we hear selections from the concerts he performed with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra in New York. And we visit Shorter at his house in Southern California to find out more about his many sources of inspiration.

""I always tell the kids when they ask, 'What do you think about when you play?'"" Shorter says. ""I say, 'All right, let's try to play what you wish for.' Play what you wish for. Play what you wish for the world to be.""

i toggle caption iStockphoto iStockphoto

When it comes to enjoying the flavors in food, our tongues really aren't that useful. They can detect just a few basic tastes: sweet, salt, sour, bitter, umami, and maybe fat.

But real complexity comes from a food or drink's aroma, and the main way we sense all the compounds isn't from sniffing. Our bodies actually blast scents from the back of our mouths up into our nasal cavity where we can take in the difference between merlot and Chianti, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.

Of course, you can smell foods by holding them up to your face and huffing. But that's not quite the same as taking in all the flavors of a food. ""When we have food or drink in our mouths, [the flavor] has to be going from the back of the mouth up and into the noise  going backwards,"" says Dr. Gordon Shepherd, a neuroscientist at Yale University.

To figure out how that works, Shepherd and a team of Yale engineers and neuroscientists built a model of the inside of a person's mouth, throat and nasal cavities. Then they used the model to analyze how air flows through it. They found that molecules from food we smell, or food volatiles, pile up at the back of our mouths and throats as we breathe.

When we're breathing in through the nose, as one might do while chewing, air whips down the nasal cavity and into the lungs, creating a kind of air curtain separating the throat and the mouth. ""That air curtain prevents all food volatiles from entering the lungs,"" says Rui Ni, a mechanical engineer at Penn State University and lead author on the study. When we exhale, air sweeps into the back of the mouth and throat where that heap of volatile compounds is and carries them up into the nose.

This all happens naturally, Ni says. ""But you can only do this effectively when you breathe smoothly,"" he says. If you're stuffing food with abandon down your throat or gasping for breath or heaving, you start to disrupt that normal pattern of airflow. Food volatiles won't store properly at the back of your mouth, and they could get sucked into your lungs and pass into the bloodstream.

The other problem, notes Laleh Golshahi, a mechanical engineer at Virginia Commonwealth University who was not involved with the study, is if you inhale too slowly while eating, that air curtain doesn't form effectively. Food volatiles don't get bounced out of the trachea and then could also be drawn into the lungs.

""[Breathing] not too fast and not too slow is the key,"" she tells The Salt in an email. ""Though the faster you exhale, you have a better chance to sweep food volatiles from the back of your throat toward the nasal cavity to smell.""

Ni agrees. And so the big takeaway from this study for us eaters is this: To get the best sensory experience from your food, eat slowly and breathe evenly as you do it.

The scientists behind the PNAS study only scanned the throat, nasal and oral cavities of one patient, Golshahi notes. So there could be variability among us that might make the situation different for each person. But best practices for anyone probably include relaxed eating and even breathing.

Savoring your food slowly seems to be the way to go for other reasons, too. One study found that when dieters ate slowly, it became easier to control their food intake. And kids who are forced to hurry down a meal in a few minutes ate less and threw out more food.",[]

It's hard not to wonder: After 35 years together, what could Karl Hyde and Rick Smith possibly cook up that's new? The Englishmen better known as Underworld have been filling arenas and festival mainstages with gargantuan, gorgeous techno for more than three decades, and are at this point considered one of the most influential electronic bands of all time. They've always prided themselves on breaking molds, but they're kicking things up a notch by billing their new album as a ""rebirth,"" or clean slate  which is even reflected in its title, Barbara Barbara, we face a shining future. That's pretty ambitious for two guys pushing 60, whose closest thing to a ""hit"" was a b-side mix that turned into one of techno's all-time greatest film placements: ""Born Slippy .NUXX"" in the '90s classic, Trainspotting.

Barbara Barbara does venture into new territory, at least for Underworld. And it comes at a pivotal time for big-room dance music, whose audience appears to be tiring of bubblegum bangers, and might just be searching for something more authentic and experimental. The group's tenth studio album is certainly that, mature and compact, its seven songs exploring both sounds they would have been unlikely to touch 20 years ago (the sitar-like twangs of ""Santiago Cuatro"") and harkens back to their guitar-band roots (the electric, thrashing ""Exhale"").

In that way, Barbara Barbara feels less like a new beginning and more a reminder of how far they've come. No track reflects this quite like ""Ova Nova,"" which blends elements from some of their best work into a swirl of synths and chants: ""Everybody, everybody, everybody..."" Hyde coos in the background. ""Change your mind..."" It has the upbeat euphoria of 2010's ""Diamond Jigsaw,"" and builds gradually, in layers, like the beloved ""Slippy,"" yet its rhythm and melodies are simple and infectious. As most of the lyrics are indecipherable, it's hard to pontificate about any greater meaning (the band requests that lyrics are not reprinted), but that leaves the blanks for the listener to fill in, personalizing the experience. Either way, Hyde and Smith have never relied on lyrics to communicate feeling. This song was designed for dancing  and crying, and hugging, and all the emotional, sentimental things people do when it becomes clear the show is almost over.

npr.org,,Guidance On Music In Broadcast Pieces,[],"Guidance On Music In Broadcast Pieces

An editor once told me that if I asked 12 economists what was likely to happen I would get 13 opinions.

That line came to mind in recent days as I talked to people across NPR News about whether we do or do not allow music to be embedded in longer news stories. Im talking about incidental music that is there, at the very least, to improve the listening experience, but otherwise has no obvious connection to the story. Im also talking about longer pieces that are broadcast, not podcasts.

 No ... I was told. NPR has a rule: No music; no sound effects. We dont put anything in our broadcast pieces that isnt true to the stories.

 Sure ... I was assured. Weve been adding music for years when its felt that scoring would improve a piece.

 Well ... others said. Music can be used as a bookend or to create a bridge between sections of a long report. But it should never be layered beneath reporting.

 But ... began some. If its obvious to listeners that the music is being used in a feature in a humorous way or in a long news story to set off a particular section, its OK to run it beneath the script.

 Only ... said some. Music may be OK in features, but only rarely and with a less is more approach. That is, be sparing. Were making news stories, not movies.

There was agreement on one thing. Music cant be used in news stories to make editorial statements or to steer a listener toward judgments or conclusions. We dont do those things  just as we would not tell the audience how to feel about the news were reporting.

But, but, but ... what is an editorial statement and when is something manipulative? We cant agree. Theres a know it when we see it sense.

After all that, heres where are:

 There is no rule against putting music into broadcast pieces. Its been done and is being done every week in features or special projects. Listen to WESUNs For The Record series, a recent Hidden Brain piece that was recast for radio, Morning Editions report on How The Libyan Revolution Opened The Door To The Islamic State and the Changing Lives of Women essay from the gray-haired granny who has gone punk rock. Judge for yourself whether the music worked.

 Even those who advocate for the use of music say that because it sounds cool is not a reason to use it. Dont do this either: Add music in the hope it will make a bad story better. Theres a problem with the story. Fix it or kill it.

 Theres agreement that music must be treated like any other piece of our journalism. An informed, editorially based decision is crucial. Be prepared to answer this question: Whats that doing there?

 Were also in agreement that incidental music should not be layered beneath straight-forward, standard news stories.

 Less is more is a very important concept. Yes, theres a case to be made that we need to keep up with the times and that some popular podcasts (including NPRs) use music very effectively. But, we care deeply about principles such as honesty, transparency and fairness. Adding music can quickly raise questions in listeners minds about whether were staying true to our principles. A decade ago in Jonathan Kerns Sound Reporting, Jay Kernis said that music could be added to certain feature stories and mini-documentaries  on rare occasions. The occasions are probably less rare these days, but were still thinking that they should be carefully considered.

This isnt a thou must or must not note, as you can see. We have to take these thoughts and apply them as cases come up. That means talking to each other. Executive producers and desk heads need to be in on decisions about whether music should or shouldnt be used in broadcast pieces. They should bring in the DMEs (Chuck Holmes and Gerry Holmes) or standards & practices editor (Mark Memmott) if outside opinions are needed. In coming months, watch for training opportunities about the use of music.

NPR's Kelly McEvers talks to petroleum-geologist-turned-writer Rick Bass about the art of the short story, specifically his short stories. A collection of the short stories he's written over the years is called, For A Little While.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

The life of author Rick Bass is quite a story. He grew up in Houston and became a petroleum geologist. He would write on his lunch breaks. And then, in 1987, he moved to rural Montana and became an environmental activist. Since then, he's written dozens of books - nonfiction, novels, short stories - and won many awards. His new short story collection is called ""For A Little While."" It's a mix of old and new stories. Rick Bass says a short story is the best way to deal with the fast pace of life right now.

RICK BASS: The short story is a beautiful reservoir that you enter. You learn something, and you get out. It fits our brain. It's a unique package, a lozenge, a lens that helps us process all kinds of information. The classic short story form with that elegant, tapered shape - it's not formulaic. It's organic, and it fits who we are as a species.

MCEVERS: Like Rick Bass, many of his characters are off the grid and surrounded by nature. And many of them are incredibly lonely, and so I asked him if loneliness is the price of living so close to the wild.

BASS: I don't think it's the woods that make them lonely. You know, it's just the atoms bouncing around faster and faster. We're being called upon to respond, respond, respond - less downtime, less leisure time, less thinking time, less - no processing time. And when you're tired, you don't have energy for passion. When you're tired or overwhelmed, you don't have the resources to dream a big life, live a big life, and that can present itself in the form of loneliness - like, gee, I wish I had a community where I could just have a meal and sit down and talk for a while. Or I wish I had time to hang out more with my kids, or I wish; I wish; I wish. I think, again, it comes back to a question of time, really. I think time is the - kind of the factor here, and the loneliness - again, not landscape or externalities.

MCEVERS: It's interesting you talk about that because, you know, your stories are very languid, you know? They move at their own pace. Do you feel that they've gotten more so as you've sort of sensed this yearning and need for more time and space?

BASS: I would suspect so. That wouldn't surprise me. What I'm hungering for as a reader is the visuals, the reminders that the world is a beautiful place, and I'm just trying to bring, you know, almost a painterly illumination on sentences, on objects, on subjects. And so there is going to be more attention to the brushwork. And I think we're so hungry to have our five senses engaged-slash-re-engaged, that that's the best way to do it - is with sentences. And the stories will take care of themselves from those sentences.

MCEVERS: There's this one story. It's called ""Pagans.""

BASS: Sure.

MCEVERS: First, can you just describe what's happening in that story and tell us where it's set?

BASS: It's set in Texas on the Gulf Coast in the 1970s, a time of great cultural and sociologic change. The two boys and the girl - they're just navigating adolescence. They're navigating the interesting interface between friendship and romantic love, skipping school and going off and mucking around on the bayou in this really rich, fertile, lush environment that's got a lot of toxins in it from ship channel plumes and so forth. And...

MCEVERS: Yeah. I mean, they're basically playing with these pieces of machinery that have been sunk in the river. The river, you say, is poisoned. They've built kind of an altar out of kind of a pile of garbage, you know? And yet, to them, it is beautiful. I'm wondering if you could read a passage. You have the book, right?

BASS: I do, yeah. I'd be happy to.

MCEVERS: To set this up, the character's looking back. It's at the very end of the story.

BASS: (Reading) He wonders sometimes if there are not the ghost or husks of their other lives living still far back in the past or far below or even further out into the future still together and still consorting other lives birth from that strange reservoir of joy and sweetness and utter newness. And if there are, how does he access that - through memory, through imagination? Even now, he marvels at how wise they were then and at all the paths they did not take.

MCEVERS: The passage is so interesting. You know, it almost sounds like you're talking directly to the reader and this idea that there's another version of this story, and it's being lived out now.

BASS: Yeah, yeah.

MCEVERS: That, to me, seems like what must be the joy of writing - is that you get to think up those versions.

BASS: You're totally on it. And I would not have thought of it myself consciously, but it comes back to this idea of scale and time. You know, as a geologist, one of the mystifying and challenging things about mapping is, you know, unconformities, these vast stretches of settlement deposition that have been re-eroded, washed away. So you'll have an old formation, then the middle formation will be gone. then you'll have a younger formation on top of it. And there'll just be this missing chunk of, you know, 200 million years or something that - and you might find a few fossils down in another formation. And you might have a fault in truth that lifts up older rock up above younger rock. But there's a lot of stuff that happens that we never know about, yeah, you know, under the ground.

MCEVERS: And the fun is filling in the blanks.

BASS: It really is, yeah, and trying to connect dots from just a very few clues.

MCEVERS: Well, Rick Bass, thank you so much for your time today.

BASS: Thank you, Kelly. I appreciate it.

MCEVERS: That's Rick Bass. He's the author of ""For A Little While,"" a new collection of stories new and old. It's out now.

On page 33 of Jonathan Kerns Sound Recording theres an entry titled: Avoid Meaningless Attributions.

Beware of the overused terms officials, analysts, critics and experts,  Jonathan writes. His message: Obviously, we should push to use actual names as often as possible. But when we cant do that, its often the case that other words can be found that are precise and offer relief from repetitive references to officials say this and experts say that.

The ubiquitous experts, for example, might be biologists, historians or numismatists, depending on their specialties. (Yes, Korva, we want you to use numismatists on the air some day.)

In some cases officials can just disappear from a line altogether. Jonathans example: Instead of writing Ford officials say theyre coming out with a new hybrid car, say Ford is coming out with a new hybrid car.

We bring this up because a look back over the past year indicates were not heeding his advice.

 Officials was heard 2,022 times.

 Critics was heard 1,055 times.

 Experts was heard 636 times.

 Analysts was heard 351 times.

Our guests were certainly responsible for many of the times those words were used. But NPR officials would have to concede that critics, experts and analysts are correct when they say that weve contributed more than our fair share. Robert Siegel can testify to that. He says in Sound Reporting that he has spent a lifetime trying to pull officials out of All Things Considered.

But, But, But ...

By now, every member of the Washington desk is poised to send an email that points out they often have to say administration officials or White House officials or Justice Department officials or some variation of those words that their sources insist on. We understand. All we ask is that alternatives be kept in the mix: Top advisers, close aides and others.

Emails are probably being drafted by the business desk (which has to deal with analysts), the science desk (experts) and others.

Dave Mattingly is surely wondering what hes supposed to do when he doesnt have time for even just a few more words.

Again, the guidance is to look for alternatives. After all, not only are the words overused, they can be problematic. Experts, for instance, is both vague and often too-readily bestowed. Critics can be a backdoor way of getting in the other side without identifying them.

The old newsroom adage if your mother says she loves you, check it out, applies to information on the Internet as well.

We all know this, but occasionally we get reminders of how important it is not to trust everything we see on the Web and to be sure to do our due diligence before passing along any information we get from there.

Case in point: On Wednesday, WAMUs Diane Rehm said to Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., senator, you have dual citizenship with Israel. Sanders quickly corrected her, but Diane went on to say that his name was on a list of lawmakers with such dual citizenship. Sanders told her that was some of the nonsense that goes on in the Internet.

Diane later issued a statement saying she had gotten the incorrect information from a comment on Facebook.

Diane has apologized. She stated as fact something that wasnt.

We didnt learn something from this episode. This is a relearning.

We have an entry about this in the Ethics Handbook entitled Give preference to original sources. Heres what it says:

For years, NPR journalists have been cautioned by their editors that an all- too-common pitfall of fact checking is verifying facts through second sources, such as other news media outlets, that do not have direct knowledge about what they supposedly know. The problem has only gotten more serious as the Internet has made it ever easier to find what others have reported as fact. Thats why we value primary sources for our facts and we check them before broadcast or publication. And we value the work of the NPR reference librarians in helping our journalists get to those original sources (to email them, look for NPR Library in the NPR internal email address book). We value our own reporting and fact-gathering over that done by other news outlets. We strongly prefer to confirm and verify information ourselves before reporting. When reporting on events we did not witness personally, we seek multiple independent perspectives to get a sharper, more accurate understanding of what happened. And if we cant verify what others are reporting, but still believe the news is important and needs to be reported, we tell listeners and readers that NPR has not yet independently confirmed the news. Too often, incorrect information is passed down from one news story to another because of the failure of the first outlet to get it right. We strive to never pass on errors in this way.

In other words, check, double-check and triple-check those so-called facts you find on the Internet. Be very skeptical about the credibility of the sources. Get first-hand information. Go right to the original source.

Confirm with mom just how she feels.

Lost in Shangri-La A True Story Of Survival, Adventure, And The Most Incredible Rescue Mission Of World War II by Mitchell Zuckoff Paperback, 432 pages | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

Author Sarah Lotz is terrified of flying, so naturally every time she gets on a plane she imagines the worst. ""I imagine how it's going to smell if things start burning,"" she says. ""I imagine the thunk of luggage falling out of the compartments at the top. ... I imagine it all in absolutely horrible detail.""

All those horrible imaginings came in handy when Lotz was writing her new book The Three  the story of three children who are the only survivors of four separate plane crashes that occur in different parts of the world on the same day.

Lotz's book is part of a long tradition of travel disaster stories. After all, travel tales don't often end well: Planes crash into dense jungles and frozen tundras. Shipwreck victims spend months in rickety boats on the high seas. Survivors are stranded on far-flung islands and must overcome terrible odds.

Indeed you could think of Odysseus' long journey home in The Odyssey as just one travel disaster after another, says Eric Wilson, author of Everyone Loves a Train Wreck.

Odysseus endures ""just one test after another of his mettle,"" Wilson explains. ""Is he wily enough, is he crafty enough, is he strong enough, is he brave enough ... and the answer in all cases is yes!""

Travel disasters typically thrust people into extreme conditions. Not only is their bravery tested, but so is their moral fortitude. Mitchell Zuckoff has written about real-life stories of travelers stranded in remote locations in his books Lost in Shangri-La and Frozen in Time. He says people get a vicarious thrill reading about such perilous adventures from the safety of their homes. But it also makes them think: ""We all fly, we all get on boats  if the worst happened, how would I react? That fascinates me,"" says Zuckoff.

One of Zuckoff's favorites is A Night to Remember, Walter Lord's account of the sinking of the Titanic, which was made into a film in 1958. Lord based his book on interviews with survivors and included the haunting image of the band that continued to play as the ship went down. But these stories don't end once the ship has sunk or the plane has crashed  often that is just the beginning.

""Most travel disasters turn into something else,"" Zuckoff says, ""a story of survival, a story of bravery, of heroism, sometimes villainy. You just don't know when it starts where it's going to go because they are unexpected events.""

It is usually the survivors who are left to tell the rest of us what really happened. In Lotz's book, the young survivors become the center of a media storm. They are suspected of being aliens or harbingers of the apocalypse.

""There is something about a miracle  for example, surviving an air crash  that to us makes them extremely special,"" Lotz says. ""They've beaten death. That really fascinates us.""

Survivors often find themselves struggling not only with forces of nature but also with each other. In Frozen in Time, Zuckoff's retelling of a cargo plane that crash-landed in Greenland during World War II, the survivors proved to be heroic.

""It was amazing,"" Zuckoff says. "" ... Every guy inside the tail section of that plane felt as though: What can I give to the guy next to me? Can I warm his feet? Can I share my rations? How do I help him survive?""

But survivors can also turn on each other, sometimes savagely, as in the novel Lord of the Flies. Being trapped in an isolated place  or a small space like a lifeboat  with a bunch of strangers can bring out the best or the worst in us, says author Eric Wilson.

""Suddenly they have to work together as a team,"" he says. "" ... There's this idea of extreme behavior where oftentimes the normal guy becomes the hero and oftentimes the seemingly extraordinary guy becomes the goat. And then there's always the possibility of cannibalism. Again, the idea that something extreme is going to happen, and in the extreme context people will learn things about themselves they did not know before.""

Wilson believes writers keep returning to the story of travels gone wrong because there is something immensely satisfying about it.

""When there is danger, when there is destruction, we kind of feel like we're on the edge of life, fully alive,"" he says. ""And that can really bring out some strong prose. And it can allow us to think about some of the great questions in the universe, such as what is the meaning of suffering?""

Sometimes a journey that ends in a disaster can bring the survivor in touch with the sublime. That's literally what happens in James Hilton's Lost Horizon, where survivors of a plane crash in the Himalayas find themselves in a paradise called Shangri-La.

The only problem is ... you'd have to survive a plane crash to get there.",[]

Mary Lattimore is a classically trained harpist from Philadelphia who incorporates experimental techniques and technologies into her music. She has performed and recorded with Kurt Vile, Sharon Van Etten, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth and Steve Gunn, among others; and is a frequent collaborator of Philly producer and multi-instrumentalist Jeff Zeigler. Lattimore's newest album, At the Dam, is the result of a prestigious fellowship she received in 2014 from the Pew Center for Arts & Heritage. She used the grant to fund a road trip across America with her harp and laptop, writing and recording songs at stops along the way, drawing inspiration from the locations, and letting the environments help define her work. The result is evocative, delicate and haunting music. The album is named for a Joan Didion essay about the Hoover Dam. ""It's enchanting, grandiose practicality, operating in its own solitude, even when humans aren't around,"" says Lattimore.

The tranquil ""Otis Walks Into the Woods"" was written in Marfa, Texas, after a visit to her family in North Carolina. About the song Lattimore says: ""I was traveling across the country with my great friend Natalie in my Volvo station wagon. I stopped home to see my parents in Polkville before picking up Natalie in Asheville. They live on the Lattimore family farm, which has some pastures, woods, a family cemetery, and have restored my great-grandfather's birthplace. We had a sweet blind black lab named Otis, an older dog, and he stuck close to the back door. The farm cats would sleep on his back and the other dog Gracie would nestle beside him. He was a cozy old guy. Before going to bed herself, my mom would let him inside to sleep on a blanket in the room off of the screened-in porch. After my visit, Natalie and I were driving through Louisiana and mom called to let me know that when she went to let Otis into the house that night, he was nowhere to be found. Dad went looking for him with Gracie and the flashlight, went deep into the woods to look for him, but he vanished without a trace. They looked and looked for weeks, but never saw a sign of him ever again. When Natalie and I got to Marfa, I set up to record at a friend's place and Otis was still on my mind, so I made him a song. I guess noble animals leave the pack to pass away in solitude and Otis, even being blind, found his way to where he wanted to go. It's a sad story but it's an ode to our pet.""

The video for ""Otis Walks Into the Woods"" captures a similarly peaceful, restful, elegant state of emotion. Shot and edited by Derrick Belcham, and choreographed and performed by Emily Terndrup and Maxwell Perkins. Lattimore says Belcham ""had this footage of dancers at the Philip Johnson Glass House, a place where I've played several times and I feel is an incredible gem."" The mini-movie captures a calm spirituality infused in Lattimore's repetitive, affecting music. It's a great match.

npr.org,2016-03-06 00:00:00,An Audacious Transformation Bogs Down In 'Blackass',[],"An Audacious Transformation Bogs Down In 'Blackass'

""Furo Wariboko awoke this morning to find that dreams can lose their way and turn up on the wrong side of sleep."" That's the first sentence of Blackass, the debut novel from Nigerian author A. Igoni Barrett, and if it sounds familiar, there's a good reason for that. The book is a long, bizarre riff on Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis, in which a salesman wakes up to find he's become an insect.

Furo's metamorphosis is markedly different: ""His hands were not black but white ... same as his legs, his belly, all of him."" His hair has become red; his eye color has changed to green. He's gone ""full oyibo,"" a Nigerian Pidgin word for a white person.

After realizing that he is not, in fact, dreaming, Furo panics. He has a job interview that he can't be late for, but he doesn't want his family to see how he's transformed. He's able to sneak out of the house that he shares with his parents and sister, and instantly draws stares as he walks to his prospective employer. ""Lone white face in a sea of black, Furo learned fast,"" Barrett writes. ""And he learnt how it felt to be seen as a freak: exposed to wonder, invisible to comprehension.""

Furo is shocked when he's instantly hired as a salesman for a book distributor. He encounters a woman named Syreeta, who lets him move in with her. And he befriends a writer named Igoni, who he meets in a shopping mall food court. Furo decides to embrace his new life as a white man (or mostly white  he learns, from Syreeta, that his buttocks have remained black). He changes his name to Frank Whyte, and throws himself into the bookselling business. He doesn't make contact with his family, who are trying desperately to find him.

It's obvious that Blackass is a satire; what's less clear is what exactly Barrett is satirizing. He does write beautifully, and sometimes humorously, on the topics of race and identity. Furo is initially homeless after he's hired at the company, and starts to question his previous assumptions: ""He had always thought that white people had it easier, in this country anyway, where it seemed that everyone treated them as special, but after everything that he had gone through since yesterday, he wasn't so sure any more.""

Barrett also has a lot to say about Nigeria, and the city of Lagos in particular, and these reflections are among the best parts of the book. ""Life in Lagos was locked in a constant struggle against empathy,"" he writes. ""Empathy was too much to ask for, too much to give: it was good only for beggars to exploit in their sob stories aimed at your pocket through your heart."" Barrett's depictions of Lagos are cutting, but also reluctantly admiring.

But the rest of Blackass gets mired down by the increasingly rambling plot. Furo's relationship with Syreeta is interesting, but Barrett's depiction of the young man's life at work is aimless and plodding; it almost feels like an afterthought.

It's obvious that 'Blackass' is a satire; what's less clear is what exactly Barrett is satirizing.

Perhaps the most bizarre sections of Blackass are the ones narrated by Igoni, who appears to be a fictional version of the author. (The character Igoni quotes lines from an interview he once gave, and they're nearly identical to ones from an interview Barrett did with Granta.) The character Igoni becomes obsessed with Furo's sister's Twitter account, and abruptly announces that he's transitioning to a woman. Neither of these things is ever really explained; they feel like another novel shoehorned into this one.

Barrett's writing is strong enough that it almost doesn't matter  it's an easy novel to read, very funny in places, and undoubtedly audacious. And he's capable of the kind of profundity that seems obvious, but really isn't: ""No one asks to be born, to be black or white or any colour in between, and yet the identity a person is born into becomes the hardest to explain to the world.""

It's a fascinating observation, and one that might explain why Blackass, though very good in parts, doesn't really work as a novel. Barrett definitely has great ideas and original observations, but it seems like he's tried too hard to force them all into one book. The result is a novel that's not unenjoyable, but one that never really comes together.",[]
npr.org,2016-03-09 00:00:00,'What Is Not Yours' Is Flawless,[],"'What Is Not Yours' Is Flawless

Most writers would give everything they own to have just one masterpiece to their name. British author Helen Oyeyemi is barely 31, and she already has at least three of them. That includes her last two novels, Mr. Fox and Boy, Snow, Bird, both of which received extensive critical acclaim in the U.S. and around the world.

It also includes her latest book, the short story collection What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours. The book contains the same sly humor, gorgeous writing and magical characters as her previous efforts. It is, in a word, flawless.

The nine stories in the book are mostly linked  characters in early stories show up in later ones, to wonderful effect. And the stories are all joined thematically; each one has a lock or key as a significant plot point. The result is that the book feels like a novel, but one that moves freely through time and geography.

The collection opens with ""Books and Roses,"" a remarkable love story about Montserrat, a foundling girl left in a Catalonia chapel with a key hanging around her neck. She grows up and finds work in a laundry, where she encounters Senora Lucy, a painter who also wears a key. Montserrat eventually discovers that she and Lucy are linked when she finds the lock that fits her key. Her reaction is bittersweet: ""She'd carried the key to this place for so long and now that she was there she didn't know where she was.""

In ""'Sorry' Doesn't Sweeten Her Tea"" (Oyeyemi clearly has a gift for great titles), sisters Day and Aisha, who are being raised by their father and his boyfriend, deal with the news that their favorite singer has been accused of savagely beating a woman. Day returns later in the funny, deeply sweet ""A Brief History of the Homely Wench Society,"" as a member of the titular club, formed at Cambridge University as an answer to an all-male student association.

Aisha, as well as some other characters from previous stories, is featured in ""Freddy Barrandov Checks ... In?"", about a young man being pressured to work in the hotel that employs his parents. Freddy is resistant to the idea: ""She wants to see good hearts and good brains put to proper use, but I'm not convinced that everybody ought to live like that, or even that everybody can.""

Oyeyemi seems to be incapable of writing anything that's not wholly original. ""Is Your Blood As Red As This?"" follows the lives of students at a bizarre puppetry school; one character is a ghost, and another, Rowan, is a ""wooden devil"" in genderless human form. ""No matter how soft his skin appears to be he is entirely wooden, and it is not known exactly what animates him  no clock ticks in his chest,"" Oyeyemi writes. ""His fellow students already had all those confusing hormone surges to deal with. So most of them stayed away, though I'm sure they all dreamed of him, her, hir, zir, a body with a tantalizing abundance of contours, this Rowan who is everything but mostly tree.""

It's one thing to write so beautifully about youth and desire; it's another thing entirely to do it in such a vividly imagined, unique setting. Oyeyemi manages to make the story both realistic and fantastical, and the characters are rendered with grace and compassion.

You could say the same thing for every story in What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours, from the subtle ""Presence"" to the chilling ""If a Book Is Locked There's Probably a Good Reason for That Don't You Think."" And even in the darkest moments of the book, Oyeyemi never loses her sense of humor  as one character notes, ""Sometimes I dream I'm falling, and it's not so much frightening as it is tedious, just falling and falling until I'm sick of it, but then a noose stops me short and I think, well, at least I'm not falling anymore.""

What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours is a lot of things: dreamy, spellbinding, and unlike just about anything you can imagine. It's a book that resists comparisons; Oyeyemi's talent is as unique as it is formidable. It's another masterpiece from an author who seems incapable of writing anything that's less than brilliant.",[]

i toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images

It appears that the attacks on presidential candidate Donald Trump's business record seem to have touched a nerve.

Despite three more primary and caucus victories on Tuesday, Trump eschewed a traditional victory speech, adding in a press conference  and something else: a table piled high with a veritable Trump-ucopia of Trump-branded products.

""I have very successful companies,"" the New York billionaire told reporters at the event at Trump National Golf Club Jupiter, in Jupiter, Fla., as raw steaks, bottles of wine and vodka, and magazines stood near the man himself.

In particular, Trump appeared irked about last week's speech by 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who declared, ""Whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there's Trump magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage. A business genius he is not.""

So what's the backstory of those products Trump pitched as a sign of his success?

Trump Steaks

Raw meat  of the real and rhetorical kinds  was front and center last night.

""Do we have steaks? We have Trump steaks,"" Trump boasted. ""If you want to take one, we'll charge you about, what, 50 bucks a steak?""

Trump did have an eponymous steak line, sold via Sharper Image. The company's website notes, however:

""Unfortunately, Trump Steaks are no longer available, but their legacy endures.""

A search for ""Trump"" on QVC's website finds various Melania Trump jewelry products, a line of Trump mattresses and one entry for Trump Steaks. But they're not actual steaks; they're ""Certified Angus Beef Steakburgers"" and QVC notes, ""We're sorry, this item is not available at this time.""

A reporter present at Trump's press conference notes that the steaks on the table were not actually a Trump brand, but appear, ironically, to have come from a company named ""Bush Brothers.""

Trump Magazine

""[Romney] said Trump Magazine is out. I said, it is? I thought I read one two days ago. This comes out, and it's called The Jewel of Palm Beach, and we  it goes to all of my clubs,"" said Trump, before throwing a copy out to the audience.

There is indeed a magazine called The Jewel of Palm Beach published by the Palm Beach Media Group that is described as ""the exclusive publication of Donald J. Trump's spectacular Mar-a-Lago Club"" and other Trump properties.

Trump does not appear to own the publisher, and the magazine only comes out on an annual basis.

There was a Trump magazine, which went out of circulation in 2009. The New York Daily News reported:

""The last iteration of the luxury lifestyle mag reached a circulation of 100,000 and sold for $5.95 before it flopped. Issues are nowhere to be found online and hardcopies are likely a rare collector's item.""

Trump Airline

""Well, I sold the airline, and I actually made a great deal, complicated and in really terrible times. The economy was horrible and I made a phenomenal deal,"" said Trump, referring to the Trump Shuttle.

NBC News recently looked back at the venture, and summarized Trump's ownership this way:

""Back in 1989, Trump pounced at the chance to buy the troubled Eastern Air Lines shuttle service for $365 million. He put the Trump name on the planes, dressed them up inside  and waited for business to boom. It didn't. But the business took on too much debt and eventually defaulted. It was sold to USAir.""

Trump University

Trump launched Trump University in 2005 to help budding real-estate entrepreneurs, but it ran afoul of regulators, who noted that it was not a degree-granting institution. Former students sued, claiming they were tricked into spending tens of thousands of dollars for seminars that didn't do anywhere near what was advertised.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is also suing and claiming that Trump and his associates defrauded students of a collective $40 million. The now-renamed Trump Entrepreneur Initiative is mostly dormant.

Trump is challenging those lawsuits and says he will win and that, when that happens, he will reopen Trump U: ""It's going to do very well,"" Trump said, ""and it will continue to do very well.""

Trump Winery

The table was stacked with bottles of Trump Wine, and Trump declared of the winery, ""I own it 100 percent, no mortgage, no debt.""

The winery's website says something different: ""Trump Winery is a registered trade name of Eric Trump Wine Manufacturing LLC, which is not owned, managed or affiliated with Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization or any of their affiliates.""

Trump, who is a teetotaler, also used to sell Trump Vodka, although that venture has also been discontinued. A review described the vodka's taste this way:

""Vodka from The Donald. Nosings reveal dry, earthy scents of grain, paraffin, kid leather, jasmine, flowers, moss and soot. Palate entry displays far better than average grain focus and viscosity; at midpalate, the taste profile turns off-dry, intensely breakfast cereal-like and biscuity. Finishes oily/creamy and snack cracker-like.""

Trump Water

There were also pallets of Trump Water on stage. On Trump's website, the water is touted as ""one of the purest natural spring waters bottled in the world.""

""I mean, we sell water, and we have water, and it's a very successful,"" Trump said, ""you know, it's a private little water company, and I supply the water for all my places, and it's good.""

So does Trump own the natural springs or bottle the water himself? According to reporters at the event who looked the label, probably not.

As Trump himself put it Tuesday night, ""So you have the water; you have the steaks; you have the airline that I sold. I mean, what's wrong with selling? Every once in a while you can sell something. You have the wines and all of that, and Trump University, we're going to start it up as soon as I win the lawsuit. Does that make sense? I mean, that's it. OK.""",[]
npr.org,2016-03-05 00:00:00,"'Rodeo' Gets In Touch With The Wild, Both Inside And Out",[],"'Rodeo' Gets In Touch With The Wild, Both Inside And Out

What would the United States be without its immigrants? Imagine no pizza, no New York City Ballet, no Saul Bellow  and no new waves of talented emigre authors helping us to see American culture from fresh angles. With his first novel, A Replacement Life, Boris Fishman (who came to the United States from Belarus in 1988 when he was nine) staked himself a spot in the impressive lineup of immigrant writers born in the former Soviet Union. He shares a satirical edginess with Gary Shteyngart, but his tragi-comic worldview and inverted sentence cadences evoke Bernard Malamud as he zeroes in on the rub between his characters' native and adoptive lands and the theme of reinvention.

Fishman's second novel, Don't Let My Baby Do Rodeo, comes harnessed with what is surely one of the oddest titles of the year. Could it refer to an assimilating immigrant's resolve to draw the line at an American pastime that outdoes even football in its violence? Fishman quickly bucks that idea. His story focuses on a Jewish couple  originally from Belarus and Ukraine  who adopt a blonde, ""unquestionable goy"" baby from Montana. ""Please don't let my baby do rodeo"" is the biological mother's sole, parting request. Huh? Well, her young husband's addiction to rodeo has destroyed both his body and their prospects.

Fishman rides the theme of adoption hard as a metaphor for cultural transplantation. Baby Max is repotted in New Jersey with Maya and Alex Rubin and Alex's overbearing parents. Maya, torn from her mother and her native culture in Kiev, can identify; she feels smothered by her life with the Rubins, who she refers to not as in-laws but as her adopted family.

Related NPR Stories

The novel jumps around in both time and tone. Set mostly in 2012, it reels back to 2004, when the couple adopt Max, and 1992, when Maya Shulman meets Alex Rubin just as her student visa is about to run out. Alex, a coddled only child who came to America at eight, is smitten by Maya's bold capriciousness: ""This is what happens when Maya comes around  her presence kneads the unease inside him until it shapes into insight.""

Unfortunately, as Fishman's focus shifts almost entirely onto restless, flighty Maya, Alex becomes a distant cipher, a void not just in Maya's life but the book. ""How will Maya know whether she said yes to the man or the country?"" her mother astutely wonders at her wedding. Twenty years later, the question eats at Maya more and more.

Max turns out to be a quiet, easy child, causing little worry  until, at eight, he begins to display a growing communion with nature, which the Rubins find bewilderingly alien. Their prejudices against wildlife run almost as deep as their prejudices against adoption, leading them to wonder whether Max's so-called ""acting out"" and ""wildness"" are written into his DNA. ""Genes are not water,"" Alex's father reminds them. ""Biologically, he is and always will be the child of those people.""

Fishman's novel veers from gently, quasi-comical to broad-stroke satirical to earnestly heartfelt. Along the way, there are plenty of sharp observations about American culture, parenting, and the adoption process. ""A unicorn comes online more often than Jewish,"" says their adoption counselor  who shares the name Mishkin with Dostoyevsky's saintly idiot.

It takes nearly two hundred pages for the Rubins to head west in search of Max's roots  by which point readers may be as restless as Maya. Once they hit the road in their aptly named Escape, the novel gains momentum. Maya confronts her alienation, homesickness, and frustrated yearning and behaves badly in the Badlands. The plains may be flat and barren, but Fishman's narrative swerves repeatedly in refreshingly unexpected directions. After a bumpy start, Don't Let My Baby Do Rodeo grows on you as it stretches beyond themes of adaptation to champion the importance of getting in touch with the great wilderness  both in nature and oneself.",[]

i Katherine Du/NPR Katherine Du/NPR

Miss Manners and skilled prep cooks should be pleased: Our early human ancestors likely mastered the art of chopping and slicing more than 2 million years ago. Not only did this yield daintier pieces of meat and vegetables that were much easier to digest raw, with less chewing  it also helped us along the road to becoming modern humans, researchers reported Wednesday.

And our ancestors picked up these skills at least 1.5 million years before cooking took off as a common way to prepare food, the researchers say.

Chewing, it turns out, takes a lot of time and energy, say Katherine Zink and Daniel Lieberman, evolutionary biologists at Harvard University. They recently set about measuring precisely how much effort is required to chew raw food, and to what degree simple stone tools might have eased the toil.

""Every time I go out to dinner, I watch people chew,"" Lieberman tells us. ""And sometimes, I actually count how many times they chew.""

It's not just a hobby. Lieberman's interest gets to some basic questions of how humans evolved.

Scientists have long known that Homo erectus, an ancestor of modern humans who lived about 2 million years ago, had already evolved to have a bigger body and brain than earlier hominins, and would have needed much more daily energy to survive. But the jaw and teeth of H. erectus were much like ours today  significantly smaller and less powerful than those of Australopithecus afarensis, or other hominins of earlier epochs.

A diet that included cooked meat would have provided that ready energy without the need for sharp canines and big grinders. But the research evidence is pretty clear that cooking didn't become common until about 500,000 years ago, Lieberman says. So, how did H. erectus get the needed calories?

To test a long-held hypothesis that simple food processing might be the answer, Zink and Lieberman invited some Harvard colleagues to what Zink calls ""a lab cafe,"" and served them small portions of carrots, beets, jewel yams and goat meat. The food was served variously as roasted or raw; sliced, pounded or left in hunks.

""If I were to give you raw goat,"" Lieberman says, ""you'd chew, and nothing would happen."" Like a lot of wild game, goat meat tends to be stringy, he says. Chewing a big piece makes it more elastic, but it doesn't readily break into pieces.

""But if you cut goat into smaller pieces,"" he says, ""your ability to chew it would improved dramatically.""

All the volunteers (14 for the vegetables and just 10 for the goat meat) wore a number of small sensors pasted to their faces, to detect and count contractions of various muscle fibers as they chewed the bite of food to the point of swallowing. The scientists then translated those contractions into a measure of muscular effort, and also checked to see how well the food was broken up.

Their results, published in the journal Nature, suggest that when eating a diet made up of one-third meat, if early humans pounded the vegetables before eating them, and sliced the meat, they would need to chew 17 percent less often and 26 percent less forcefully than if they started with larger slabs of the food. Every little flex of the jaw and grinding of the teeth adds up: Over the course of a year, Lieberman says, simply having a sharp stone to slice meat would reduce the number of ""chews"" needed by 2.5 million.

""I think it's amazing,"" he says, ""to think that the simple stone tool could have a massive effect on how effectively we chew a piece of meat.""

It's possible, he and Zink think, that the benefits of meat-eating and food processing favored the transition to smaller teeth and jaws.

But it seems more likely, they write in their study, that tool use and meat-eating simply reduced the evolutionary pressure to have big, powerful jaws and sharp teeth, ""thus permitting selection to decrease facial and dental size for other functions, such as speech production, locomotion, thermoregulation, or, perhaps even changes in the size and shape of the brain.""

Pat Conroy, the beloved author of The Great Santini, The Lords of Discipline and The Prince of Tides, has died. Conroy  who announced last month that he had pancreatic cancer  died Friday night at his home among his family in Beaufort, S.C. He was 70 years old.

Pat Conroy was a master storyteller, blending the raw material of his difficult family life with the landscape of coastal South Carolina. In 1986, Conroy told me that the reason he wrote was to explain his own life to himself.

""Writing has been not therapeutic for me, but it has been essential,"" he said in an interview for Morning Edition. ""I have written about my mother, my father, my family ... and if I get it on paper, I have named the demon.""

Conroy's best known work is The Prince of Tides, a novel about a troubled South Carolina native recounting his story to a New York psychiatrist.

The prologue begins: ""My wound is geography.""

I was born and raised on a Carolina sea island and I carried the sunshine of the low country, inked in dark gold, on my back and shoulders. As a boy I was happy above the channels, navigating a small boat between the sandbars with their quiet nation of oysters exposed on the brown flats at the low watermark.

Nan Talese was Pat Conroy's editor for the past 35 years, beginning with The Prince of Tides  a span that saw Conroy's book sales rise to a total of 20 million copies worldwide.

She recalled the first thing he said to her when they met. ""He said, 'I will tell you, if there are ten words for something, I will use all ten. Your job is to take them out.'""

Talese said Conroy touched people with his language and his honesty.

""His incredible sense of empathy with people. ... I think that his books influenced a lot of people because he was so open and honest. And it really struck their hearts.""

Pat Conroy was born in 1945 in Atlanta. He was a self-described ""military brat."" His family moved every year until they settled in Beaufort when he was 12.

YouTube

In his 1976 book The Great Santini, Conroy wrote about his relationship with his abusive father, a Marine aviator. In the 1979 film version of the story, the father is played by Robert Duvall. In one scene, he addresses his four young children after a move, as if they are soldiers under his command.

After high school, Pat Conroy's father sent his oldest son to The Citadel, Charleston's storied military academy, where Pat began to write fiction. Conroy said his natural storytelling ability was never affected by literary theory.

""I missed all the classes in the art of fiction,"" Conroy said in 1986. ""We didn't have any. I'm great on military science. But I missed all the classes on 'Is this a great technique for fiction?' I never learned any of that stuff.""

His education as a writer came elsewhere.

""I came from a family of great storytellers,"" he said. ""That is something about the South I think has been preserved. The yarn, the story, and the ability to tell one well, is a beloved trait in several of my uncles and aunts. And a great story changes the world for you  changes the way you look at life.""

Pat Conroy said he looked for stories that told something about the world that he didn't know before.

And he said he faced challenges along the way. ""The one thing I've had is a very painful life filled with utter moments of great joy. Things happen to me for reasons I cannot figure out. And things have continued to happen to me all my life, and happen to my family all my life, and now happen to my friends. ... What I hope is that I don't die before I can tell all the stories I still haven't told.""

Conroy was telling those stories until the end. Before he died he finished a short novel called Aquarius, set in the Vietnam era, and dedicated to his ""friends who become teachers.""",[]

When she was 17, Tracey Helton Mitchell was prescribed an opioid pain killer after getting her wisdom teeth extracted. The medicine helped her deal with the pain related to the extraction, but when the prescription ran out, her desire for its euphoric high remained. That's when she turned to heroin.

As a teenager, Mitchell imagined heroin to be glamorous, but she found it wasn't once she became an addict. She tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that the drug ruined her health and her self-esteem. She lived in an alley, shot drugs into the bottom of her feet, sold her body for money and was jailed several times. She was also featured in a 1999 documentary about addicts called Black Tar Heroin.

At one of her lowest points, Mitchell says, ""I was having heart palpitations, because I was using stimulants, and I thought, 'They're going to pull me out of this hotel, I have no ID, my parents, my family ... will never know that I died and I'll just be a Jane Doe and this is how I'm going to expire in this place.' ""

But Mitchell didn't die from her addiction. Rather, with the help of the nondenominational 12-step program LifeRing and other support groups and therapies, she eventually stopped using and became a certified addiction specialist. She has been clean for 18 years.

In her new memoir, The Big Fix, Mitchell writes about her addiction and her path to recovery, and also shares insights into today's heroin epidemic. When it comes to our current treatment system, Mitchell says we would do better to reach out to addicts as individuals, by recognizing each user's unique needs and motivations.

Our current method of treatment is ""sort of a one-size-[fits]-all approach,"" she says. ""We need to have a variety of different kinds of treatment interventions that address people's needs.""

Interview Highlights

On what it's like to watch Black Tar Heroin now that she's clean

It can be painful to watch, especially when I think about my life now and I contrast that. ... My legs did look like I was dropped in a dumpster and picked out by rats. I had, I think, 34 or 36 abscesses. I have scars that have healed, but I had to have surgeries on some and in the summertime when everybody else is wearing shorts and stuff like that, I see those things  even right now sitting here at the table I can see one of the scars on my arms. It's a good thing in that it reminds me of where I was, but then it's also very challenging, because this documents a very unpleasant part of my life that can't be changed.

On why she agreed to be filmed

I really believed that I was going to die, or be murdered. There was lots of evidence to make me feel that way, and I wanted it to be something that people would see after I was dead that showed that heroin was not the glamorous thing that I had thought it was when I was a teenager and had imagined it. I wasn't paid for the film; it was a huge inconvenience in my life, but I feel like it still is sort of my legacy to the world, because it's something that's watched today. Millions of people still watch it.

On black tar heroin in the '90s versus heroin today

There's still tar heroin. The heroin that most people get today is much, much stronger. We didn't have to worry about fentanyl  of us dropping dead from an overdose, because no one cut it with fentanyl. The thing that we really worried about was getting flesh-eating [bacteria, necrotizing fasciitis] ... or getting some kind of wound botulism or getting abscesses. There certainly were overdoses then. You could get arrested for overdosing and a lot of people were rolled out at the hospitals or left outside to die ... but there wasn't this culture of heroin where heroin is prevalent absolutely everywhere. It was more localized to big cities, more urban areas.

On 'hitting bottom'

i toggle caption Michael Kerner Photography/Seal Press Michael Kerner Photography/Seal Press

I don't believe in the concept of a bottom. I think that if the opposite of addiction is connection, that addicts or people who use drugs are really seeking out  they need some kind of connection with people. And I would say I've had a wide variety of bottoms, but I wasn't ready to stop until I started to believe that there was a possibility that I actually could stop and saw reasons for myself to stop, and my motivation is totally different.

On being ready to get clean

One of the myths about addiction is that you come to this incredible moment of clarity and that you decide that you're going to stop. And so over the course of my using I had various moments of clarity and I had various points where I had wanted to stop, but they were not always congruent with my opportunities.

So there [were] very few opportunities where I really could truly try to stop, but I would stop using for a few days, I'd try to kick on my own, I'd switch to different drugs, I'd move to different places. I tried different things to stop, but I wasn't completely ready, because all these different traumas had accumulated in my life, and I wasn't prepared to deal with the emotional consequences of all these different things. And that's what to me being off drugs meant  was that I would have to then figure out how I was going to fix all these things on my own. And it wasn't until I got an idea that maybe other people would help me, talking to my mother, knowing that I would have some kind of emotional support where I'd start seeing [that] maybe I don't have to totally do all of this on my own.

On needle exchange programs

At the time there was no needle exchange at all [in Cincinnati] and so you would use the same syringe over and over again and hopefully it didn't break off in your arm. Until the numbers wore off of it, you would sharpen it on a matchbook, and it was just horrible; it was like a rusty nail sticking in your arm.

So I came to San Francisco and they had needle exchanges, which was a revelation, because so many people in the country were suffering from HIV and AIDS, particularly AIDS, because there was no anti-retrovirals. ... So the syringe exchange people provided me education about my drug use. ...

I've seen in my life so many examples of where not having a clean syringe never stopped anyone. I've seen people pick them up out of the gutters. Even here in San Francisco, where there's a lot of access, people break open sharps containers that they've stolen from hospitals because they needed a syringe and they don't have one. ... It doesn't stop people. All it does is spread a public health crisis.

On harm reduction and the argument that harm reduction enables users

My answer is, you can't get clean if you're dead, so there has to be harm reduction. We're not encouraging people to do anything, we're taking a look at their public health behaviors and then addressing what the particular needs are, so look at the cost of one syringe versus the cost of someone getting hepatitis C and having to take care of them for a lifetime.

Look at the public health cost of various other medical conditions that a person can have. From not using sterile water or alcohol pads, someone having endocarditis or some other infection, so having a safe system for people to take care of themselves and treating addicts, users not just addicts, there's plenty of people who use who are not necessarily considered on the spectrum of drug addicts, treating people humanely and having them have access to public health services and the things that they need.

On coping with depression since becoming clean

Part of the reason why I wanted to write The Big Fix is because I felt like there's no ... real education on long-term recovery about what really happens over time. So dealing with topics like untreated depression and anxiety and all the other kind of things that you go through when you take the drugs away, and then you have new issues, because before you use drugs, you didn't have all these guilty, shameful things that you ... now have to deal with, if you're a person like me and you get off drugs.

So I've had a very complicated relationship with my emotions in the past 18 years that I've been clean. I've dealt with very serious post-traumatic stress disorder, being very checked out and dissociative at various points, having to deal with the constant specter of depression, every once in a while having suicidal thoughts. And one of the things that I try to do is really normalize those feelings when people want to know what recovery is really like. It's like, some days you really feel crappy. You really have some things that are going on with you, and I think the prevalent idea is that you get clean and everything is supposed to be great. ... You can have a great life and still not feel all that great.",[]

It appears that the attacks on presidential candidate Donald Trump's business record seem to have touched a nerve.

Despite three more primary and caucus victories on Tuesday, Trump eschewed a traditional victory speech, adding in a press conference  and something else: a table piled high with a veritable Trump-ucopia of Trump-branded products.

""I have very successful companies,"" the New York billionaire told reporters at the event at Trump National Golf Club Jupiter, in Jupiter, Fla., as raw steaks, bottles of wine and vodka, and magazines stood near the man himself.

In particular, Trump appeared irked about last week's speech by 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who declared, ""Whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there's Trump magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage. A business genius he is not.""

So what's the backstory of those products Trump pitched as a sign of his success?

Trump Steaks

Raw meat  of the real and rhetorical kinds  was front and center last night.

""Do we have steaks? We have Trump steaks,"" Trump boasted. ""If you want to take one, we'll charge you about, what, 50 bucks a steak?""

Trump did have an eponymous steak line, sold via Sharper Image. The company's website notes, however:

""Unfortunately, Trump Steaks are no longer available, but their legacy endures.""

A search for ""Trump"" on QVC's website finds various Melania Trump jewelry products, a line of Trump mattresses and one entry for Trump Steaks. But they're not actual steaks; they're ""Certified Angus Beef Steakburgers"" and QVC notes, ""We're sorry, this item is not available at this time.""

A reporter present at Trump's press conference notes that the steaks on the table were not actually a Trump brand, but appear, ironically, to have come from a company named ""Bush Brothers.""

Trump Magazine

""[Romney] said Trump Magazine is out. I said, it is? I thought I read one two days ago. This comes out, and it's called The Jewel of Palm Beach, and we  it goes to all of my clubs,"" said Trump, before throwing a copy out to the audience.

There is indeed a magazine called The Jewel of Palm Beach published by the Palm Beach Media Group that is described as ""the exclusive publication of Donald J. Trump's spectacular Mar-a-Lago Club"" and other Trump properties.

Trump does not appear to own the publisher, and the magazine only comes out on an annual basis.

There was a Trump magazine, which went out of circulation in 2009. The New York Daily News reported:

""The last iteration of the luxury lifestyle mag reached a circulation of 100,000 and sold for $5.95 before it flopped. Issues are nowhere to be found online and hardcopies are likely a rare collector's item.""

Trump Airline

""Well, I sold the airline, and I actually made a great deal, complicated and in really terrible times. The economy was horrible and I made a phenomenal deal,"" said Trump, referring to the Trump Shuttle.

NBC News recently looked back at the venture, and summarized Trump's ownership this way:

""Back in 1989, Trump pounced at the chance to buy the troubled Eastern Air Lines shuttle service for $365 million. He put the Trump name on the planes, dressed them up inside  and waited for business to boom. It didn't. But the business took on too much debt and eventually defaulted. It was sold to USAir.""

Trump University

Trump launched Trump University in 2005 to help budding real-estate entrepreneurs, but it ran afoul of regulators, who noted that it was not a degree-granting institution. Former students sued, claiming they were tricked into spending tens of thousands of dollars for seminars that didn't do anywhere near what was advertised.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is also suing and claiming that Trump and his associates defrauded students of a collective $40 million. The now-renamed Trump Entrepreneur Initiative is mostly dormant.

Trump is challenging those lawsuits and says he will win and that, when that happens, he will reopen Trump U: ""It's going to do very well,"" Trump said, ""and it will continue to do very well.""

Trump Winery

The table was stacked with bottles of Trump Wine, and Trump declared of the winery, ""I own it 100 percent, no mortgage, no debt.""

The winery's website says something different: ""Trump Winery is a registered trade name of Eric Trump Wine Manufacturing LLC, which is not owned, managed or affiliated with Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization or any of their affiliates.""

Trump, who is a teetotaler, also used to sell Trump Vodka, although that venture has also been discontinued. A review described the vodka's taste this way:

""Vodka from The Donald. Nosings reveal dry, earthy scents of grain, paraffin, kid leather, jasmine, flowers, moss and soot. Palate entry displays far better than average grain focus and viscosity; at midpalate, the taste profile turns off-dry, intensely breakfast cereal-like and biscuity. Finishes oily/creamy and snack cracker-like.""

Trump Water

There were also pallets of Trump Water on stage. On Trump's website, the water is touted as ""one of the purest natural spring waters bottled in the world.""

""I mean, we sell water, and we have water, and it's a very successful,"" Trump said, ""you know, it's a private little water company, and I supply the water for all my places, and it's good.""

So does Trump own the natural springs or bottle the water himself? According to reporters at the event who looked the label, probably not.

As Trump himself put it Tuesday night, ""So you have the water; you have the steaks; you have the airline that I sold. I mean, what's wrong with selling? Every once in a while you can sell something. You have the wines and all of that, and Trump University, we're going to start it up as soon as I win the lawsuit. Does that make sense? I mean, that's it. OK.""",[]

 Police say it didnt happen.

In situations such as this, we should first ask whether we should repeat the claim. After all, repeating it might give it more life. But if the answer to that question is yes, we should get to the point and say what weve found. Heres how The Two-Way has done it:

We asked our library to look through contemporaneous news reports. They tell us that that they could not turn up any news accounts of American Muslims cheering or celebrating in the wake of Sept. 11.

Another way to say that might be: NPR has searched for credible news accounts about large groups of American Muslims celebrating during or after the Sept. 11 attacks. No such accounts have been found.

We could also flatly report that no evidence has been found in police or credible media accounts from the time to indicate there were large numbers of Muslim-Americans in New Jersey celebrating. We have used the no evidence framing on the air.

Regarding The Washington Post report from Sept. 18, 2001, that Trump has cited, it stated that in Jersey City, within hours of two jetliners plowing into the World Trade Center, law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river. But as we said on Morning Edition this week, there is no reference in the [Washington Post] article to Trumps claim of seeing thousands and thousands Muslims celebrating in Jersey City.

FactCheck.org has noted that:

The Post story said that Jersey City police detained a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding a tailgate-style party in Jersey City. That allegation was unattributed and unverified. Even if it did happen, and there is no evidence of it, the celebrating was not on TV and did not involve thousands and thousands of people.

Before Black Lives Matter was a hashtag, before it was a slogan chanted by protesters in cities across the country, before it was a national movement, it was a Facebook post by an Oakland-based activist named Alicia Garza. She wrote it after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. It read in part: ""I continue to be surprised at how little black lives matter, and I will continue that. Stop giving up on black life."" She ended by saying, ""Black people, I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.""

NPR's Kelly McEvers spoke with Jelani Cobb, who recently wrote an article in the New Yorker about Black Lives Matter, how the movement started and where it stands today. He talks about how those three words were later adopted as a rallying cry by protesters from around the country who came to Ferguson, Mo. after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer.

Interview Highlights

On tensions about who speaks for the movement

""I think there's been a conflict that's played itself out publicly in terms of the people who founded the idea or came up with the name and the people who really did the pivotal work on the ground in Ferguson. In some ways, it's an entity that has two births. It's conceived after one tragedy and really comes to fruition after another. And we've talked about the Internet and social media and the ways that those things have really revolutionized and changed the way social activism happens. In some ways that's a plus, but it can be a really big liability as well because a good bit of the conflict between the various factions of Black Lives Matter has played itself out in public and on social media...

""A little more recently, Alicia Garza was going to come to St. Louis to give a speech at Webster University, and a great deal of social media chatter erupted about this and whether or not she had any place coming there, and whether it was more appropriate to think of the people who were in St. Louis and Ferguson as the founders. When I spoke to Alicia Garza about it, she said that she got death threats and threats of violence, and she wound up canceling the talk. That became kind of a crucial moment in the history of this organization where a person who is organizing about African-Americans and their lives is really not giving a talk because of threats to her own.""

On how earlier ideas of leadership don't necessarily work for this movement

""We associate whole blocks of history with W.E.B. Du Bois or Booker T. Washington or Malcolm X or Dr. King. Entire constellations of history are distilled down to two individuals, almost always male. There's been a certain kind of fatigue, and Black Lives Matter represents that. They find a more horizontal ethic of leadership to be more important, and they find inspiration from Ella Baker, who was one of the most central figures of the civil rights movement in - partly due to her belief in kind of grassroots and local leadership in her aversion to the spotlight. Her story wasn't as well known. And so they have kind of resurrected her idea that it's better to have 10,000 candles than a single spotlight.""

On who Black Lives Matter represents

""Movements tend to pick up where the last one left off. When people look back at the civil rights movement, one of the most glaring shortcomings that emerges is in many ways the marginalization of women within the movement or things like Bayard Rustin, who was the pivotal organizer of the March on Washington, but also faced discrimination as a gay black man. Those are the things that Black Lives Matter look at and say, we want to not replicate those things. We want to not replicate the errors of the past.""

On the effects of having a diffuse organization

""When I talked with Alicia Garza, she was very clear about making a distinction between Black Lives Matter the organization and Black Lives Matter as a movement. But it's been almost kind of like a franchising effect. The fact that there's a low barrier to entry has been useful when there are people who have never participated in a political protest before and they're willing to come out and say, 'OK, I can be part of this Black Lives Matter thing, and I agree with, you know, what's happening here.' At the same time, it makes it a little bit more difficult to have a kind of discipline within the ranks. And then you have a third element, which is the tendency of people to refer to any statement by a disgruntled black person as...connected to Black Lives Matter.""

On where Black Lives Matter could go from here

""I don't think it's easy to predict these things. But one of the things that I think we ought to take note of is the circumstances that allow Black Lives Matter to flourish. One is the existence of a black presidency and these sorts of egregious racial problems continuing in the context of a black presidency, which contributed to a climate of frustration. And we're in the last year of the Obama presidency, and so that will change. In addition to that, precisely because we're in an election year, we've seen the movement to be able to leverage influence and - helping to shape and push the direction in which these two candidates on the Democratic side, at least, are moving. I don't think that necessarily will happen after the presidential election. Or at least it's not as easily achieved.""

On the distance between the political process and everyday realities

""It's not necessarily that the black president is not doing more, because I don't think it all lays at President Obama's feet. I think it's the frustration of having both of these circumstances coexist, that you can be represented at the most powerful level of electoral politics and you can have incidents like the death of Trayvon Martin and the subsequent acquittal of George Zimmerman. Those two things are fully capable of coexisting.""

npr.org,,"When Were Asked To Remove A Photo, Heres What We Do",[],"When Were Asked To Remove A Photo, Heres What We Do

Occasionally, someone in a photo we have posted asks that we remove the image from our website.

Any such request must be redirected to:

 Kainaz Amaria or another editor from the Visuals team.

 Chuck and/or Gerry Holmes, the deputy managing editors.

In most cases, the correspondent producer or staff photographer who took the image will already be aware of the request, as will the editor who handed the report. If not, they will be drawn into the discussion by Kainaz, Chuck and/or Gerry.

Others who will be brought in:

 Digital ME Scott Montgomery.

 Standards & Practices editor Mark Memmott.

The executive editor, VP for News and SVP for News will be looped in too.

The issue of whether to remove an image is a serious matter. As weve said before when discussing requests to take down stories, we agree with the AP that:

We are guided by a newsroom policy that says it is inappropriate to remove content from our Website. If a report is inaccurate, we will correct it and state why it has been altered. If relevant new information emerges, we will update or do a follow-up story. But our content is a matter of public record and is part of our contract with our audience. To simply remove it from the archive diminishes transparency and trust and, in effect, erases history. This is not a practice engaged in by credible news organizations or in line with ethical journalism.

A key question that will be asked when such requests come in: What was the person told about how the photo or photos would be used?

It is important that people know were not doing stories that only go on the air. We spend time making sure they understand that the stories live on our website and that the photos we take will be there as well. And as weve said before:

Kainaz Amaria from NPRs visuals team says she has found that the more transparent I am about my intentions with people in my story, the more they are willing to share their time and moments. It may sound counterintuitive, but in fact its been proven to me every time I step out of the office and into someones life. If people trust you, trust you are there to listen and learn, youll be surprised at the access they will offer you. ... If people say, Wait you are radio, why do you want my picture? I usually say something like, Well, many of our stories go online to reach a wider audience and to get more eyeballs. Chances are if they see you, then they will connect with your story. 

Kainaz and the Visuals team have considerable experience dealing with this issue. If a request comes in, they should take the lead. In most cases, it should be someone from Visuals who gets back to the person who wants a photo removed.

ROSENTHAL: OK.

BILL KURTIS: A war against calmness I wage. This pose is called rat in a cage. I scream and I swear as the metal jams blare. My yoga is fueled by...

ROSENTHAL: My rage?

SAGAL: Yes, rage.

KURTIS: Rage, doctor.

ROSENTHAL: Yes.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: So it turns out Calgary, Canada, is apparently on the cutting edge of the yoga scene. A couple weeks ago, we told you about a studio in Calgary offering couple's nude yoga. This week, we learned about a Calgary yoga instructor that is - who is offering rage yoga. It's just a coincidence. It's easy to imagine how a nude couples yoga could lead to directly to rage yoga. But rage yoga, as advertised in Calgary - it's just regular yoga but with more swearing, loud music and beer. And instead of a yoga studio, rage yoga is down in the basement of a pub. So really it's a lot less like yoga and more like having a woman yell at you what while you try to bend yourself out of the way.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: I just - I mean, I've been doing yoga and it's very nice. I just can't imagine doing it while somebody's yelling at me.

ADAM BURKE: I can't imagine it any other way.

SAGAL: OK.

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: Can you - can you imagine doing it nude? Because that seems...

SAGAL: No, no...

ROBERTS: Yeah, I see that...

SAGAL: We discussed this at some length. There's no way ever, no.

GOLDTHWAIT: Wait, imagine myself or other people?

SAGAL: Anybody.

ROBERTS: Anybody.

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: Stop it. Open your eyes.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, here is your next limerick, Lila.

ROSENTHAL: OK, ready.

KURTIS: When I'm tired, my teeth crave more crunchies. I'm full but I'll snack on this fun cheese. It's sleep that I need, but I act high on weed. Fatigue is the cause of my...

ROSENTHAL: Muchies.

SAGAL: Yes.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

KURTIS: It is.

ROSENTHAL: Come on, I'm in Boulder, for heaven's sake.

SAGAL: You are.

(LAUGHTER)

KURTIS: You ought to know.

SAGAL: You don't have to be stoned though to get the munchies. You just have to be tired. Researchers at the University of Chicago - go Chicago - found out that when...

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Yes, when you're sleep-deprived, your brain releases chemicals, endocannabinoids, that act very similar to those of marijuana. And this is why when you're sort of tired and staggering around the kitchen you eat so much. You're not baked; you're just high on life. And now that we know our brains can produce the same chemicals as pot, think about how much money we'll save. Your drug dealer is your own brain, although weirdly, you still don't want to talk to it more than you have to.

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: How much did this research cost to unlock the old food-energy paradigm?

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: Turns out when you're tired, you might need to eat something.

GOLDTHWAIT: You might get a little...

SAGAL: Well, no, no, the idea is - you know, the munchies are just sort of a kind of a hunger - I want to eat something even though you're not necessarily hungry with the munchies.

GOLDTHWAIT: I think that's true. Like, I've had a lot of insomnia, and I do get ravenous. And I think I'm going to eat and then it's going to put me to sleep.

SAGAL: No, it never works.

ROBERTS: So what do you much on?

GOLDTHWAIT: Just everything - well, I don't eat much, you know? I mean, I don't get this body by abusing it.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, here, Lila, is your last limerick.

ROSENTHAL: OK.

KURTIS: Though Kanye might think himself regal, his actions are weird but still legal. He would keep drones at bay with some grand birds of prey. As guards, he'll trade dogs for an...

ROSENTHAL: Seagull.

(LAUGHTER)

ROSENTHAL: Sagal.

BURKE: The confidence.

KURTIS: Good for you.

(APPLAUSE)

GOLDTHWAIT: Do you know - do you know how - do you know how close...

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: Do you know how close the American bald seagull was our...

SAGAL: Yeah, no.

GOLDTHWAIT: ...National bird?

ROSENTHAL: Oh, man. It's eagle?

SAGAL: It is eagle, yeah.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Although I was excited because of course, the American bald seagull is my second cousin.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Say what you - it's eagle - say what you will about rapper Kanye West - he's narcissistic, he's thin-skinned, he's the biggest [expletive] in the Kardashian family.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: But he's a brilliant innovator in all things. And so when Kanye has been thinking about protecting his family, especially from paparazzi, he went right to mercenary-trained in eagles. Kanye West is reportedly trying to hire these eagles that Danish police have trained to attack drones. He's tired of these paparazzi drones sent to take pictures of himself and his family. But he can't help himself. Eagle tries to do its job, eagle's attacking the drone, Kanye would drop in and say I'm going to let you finish but a falcon is the best raptor of all time.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Bill, how did Lila do on our quiz?

KURTIS: Well, Lila was a winter before she tried to change the national bird. But congratulations anyway, Lila from Boulder.

SAGAL: Thank you so much, Lila.

ROSENTHAL: Thank you.

SAGAL: Bye-bye.

As Canada's new leader, Justin Trudeau should by rights be moving into the official prime minister's residence in Ottawa. It was a place where he spent much of his childhood, when his father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, led the nation. But after years of neglect, the 34-room riverfront mansion is in such bad repair that Trudeau and his family have to live elsewhere.

Complaints about the residence at 24 Sussex Drive are legendary. Margaret Trudeau, the new prime minister's mother, famously called the residence ""the crown jewel of the federal penitentiary system."" The wife of a former Canadian prime minister placed buckets in the living room to catch rain leaking through the roof. Another complained it was freezing in the winter.

From a distance, the 138-year-old limestone structure looks distinguished and befitting a Canadian leader. But it shows its age when you get up close.

Diane Beckett, the interim director of the Sierra Club of Canada, visited 24 Sussex Drive a few years ago and describes it as ""quite worn down and quite faded."" The kitchen was minuscule, she says, and the place was drafty.

""They put in this 1960s cheap patio door that you would have in your cottage. And so when I was there, they had actually covered it in plastic to keep the cold out,"" Beckett says.

In 2008, Canada's auditor general released a report saying decades of neglect had left just about everything in the residence in critical need of repairs: floors, ceilings, electrics, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, not to mention the asbestos that needs to be removed. The cost of those repairs was estimated at $10 million Canadian, or about $7.5 million U.S., and those estimates will likely double at the very least.

Historian and author Charlotte Gray says the residence has had no major repairs in more than 50 years because prime ministers don't want to spend the political capital.

""It's always absolutely red meat for the opposition,"" she says. ""This is the perfect opportunity to say your government is spending your dollars on luxury for their leader.""

Gray says some former leaders learned this the hard way. ""When Pierre Trudeau, the present prime minister's father, put in a swimming pool, that was seen as enormously self-indulgent,"" she says. ""And then when Prime Minister [Brian] Mulroney, he tried to upgrade it because he had a much swankier lifestyle  again, it was seen as he was putting on airs.""

Many other leaders simply chose to ignore the problems, Gray says.

Now that Trudeau has decided to move his family to another home, there is debate about what to do with the official residence. Many Canadians believe it's a heritage building that needs to be restored, and the hosts of two popular home renovation TV shows have offered their services.

Environmentalists like the Sierra Club's Beckett say the residence needs to be made energy efficient, in keeping with Trudeau's commitment to fighting climate change.

Greg Furlong, an energy specialist with Canada's EnviroCentre, says either way, great care needs to be taken with any sort of renovation on an old stone building.

""A lot of these older structures stay standing just because they were built in a certain era with certain conditions in mind,"" Furlong says. ""And sometimes if you change the conditions, then the structure will start to deteriorate.""

Maureen McTeer, the wife of former Prime Minister Joe Clark, says it's time to tear the place down. She told the CBC's Ontario Today program that it's not worth spending millions of dollars just to make 24 Sussex livable when there could be a new, modern prime minister's residence.

""I would very much like to see a house built which is worthy of all that is best in Canada, our best people putting it together, our best architects,"" she said.

A decision on the fate of the prime minister's residence isn't expected anytime soon.",[]
npr.org,,Guidance On Key Words That Come Up In The Planned Parenthood Stories,[],"Guidance On Key Words That Come Up In The Planned Parenthood Stories

Flatly saying or writing that Planned Parenthood officials have been secretly recorded discussing the sale of fetal tissue is akin to concluding that they committed a crime. That is a problem. We should not attach such judgments to people or institutions until the confessions or convictions are in.

Weve been on the story. Meanwhile, both FactCheck.org and PolitiFact have explored what is and isnt known at this point about what Planned Parenthood has done. FactCheck links to the 1993 law that defines what is and is not legal regarding the use of fetal tissue. Here are two key sections:

 PURCHASE OF TISSUE  It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce.

 The term valuable consideration does not include reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.

The video makers and other Planned Parenthood critics say the organization was selling fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood says the tissue has been donated, not sold, and that only the organizations costs (reasonable payments) have been covered.

The facts are not all in.

For now, just as we would report that prosecutors say John Doe robbed the bank, we should attribute references to fetal tissue being sold. Theyre coming from Planned Parenthoods critics, for example. Conversely, at this point it is for Planned Parenthood to say  not us  that these were donations, not sales.

In the short space of a Newscast spot, an allegedly or accused of may be required when there isnt time to say more.

There are cases to be made for saying that Planned Parenthood officials were heard discussing how they could provide fetal tissue to researchers, or how those researchers could procure or obtain it. The issue of money being paid should be addressed in most reports. But, again, attribution is important when characterizing those payments.

A NASA mission to Mars that was originally scheduled to launch this month  then was canceled when a flaw was discovered in a pivotal piece of equipment  is back on the calendar. If all goes well, it will launch in 2018.

The InSight mission  or ""Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport"" mission  has been in the works since 2012. It will send a lander to the Red Planet to measure Mars' seismic activity and interior temperature, among other things.

Data on marsquakes and the planet's interior heat will help researchers better understand Mars' ""deep interior,"" NASA says. That, in turn, could help expand scientists' understanding of the formation of all rocky planets, including Earth.

The original launch was planned for March 2016. But in December, the mission had to be suspended because a flaw in the lander's French-built seismometer couldn't be fixed in time.

The instrument needs to work inside a vacuum ""to provide the exquisite sensitivity needed for measuring ground movements as small as half the radius of a hydrogen atom,"" NASA says  and the container needed to maintain that vacuum was leaking.

At the time, it wasn't clear if the mission would be postponed or called off altogether. But on Wednesday, NASA announced that it would resume work on the project.

No matter how quickly the vacuum issue is resolved, March 5, 2018, is the earliest the mission could launch. That window of opportunity depends on the alignment of the orbits of Earth and Mars.

The InSight mission is a part of NASA's Discovery Program, in which scientists compete for approval of relatively low-cost planetary missions. (The total cost of InSight was to be capped at $675 million, Science Magazine reported last December. At that time, NASA had already spent $525 million, and the space agency is currently assessing the cost added by the two-year delay.)

When InSight was picked, it beat out two other finalists  one that would have sent a probe to a comet to hop across its surface and study multiple locations, and another that would have sent a boat to Titan, one of the moons of Saturn, to travel across its hydrocarbon oceans.

NASA is currently in the process of selecting the next Discovery Program mission  or missions  from a set of five finalists, including projects studying Venus and a probe to land on a metallic asteroid.

NASA had originally suggested it might select two winners, instead of just one, this year. It's not yet clear if InSight's rescheduled launch will affect that decision or any other planned NASA missions.",[]

Sir George Martin, the music producer who signed the Beatles to a recording contract in 1962 and was their intimate collaborator as they together transformed popular music, died Tuesday at the age of 90.

Martin's death was confirmed by Adam Sharp, his manager in the U.K. In a statement, Sharp said:

Sir George Martin passed away peacefully at home yesterday evening, Tuesday March 8th. The family would like to thank everyone for their thoughts, prayers and messages of support.

Martin was often referred to as the ""Fifth Beatle."" He scoffed, but the band wouldn't have been the Beatles we know without him.

Martin's 1979 memoir (co-authored with Jeremy Hornsby) was titled All You Need Is Ears  but his ears, and his instincts as a music producer, were extraordinary.

A classically trained composer, George Martin began to work for the British record label EMI's imprint Parlophone Records in 1950, overseeing classical recordings as well as comedy records by the likes of Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Bernard Cribbins.

By 1962, when Cribbins' song ""Right Said Fred"" became a hit in the U.K., George Martin was running Parlophone Records and looking to sign up a rock 'n' roll band. The Beatles auditioned for him in June of 1962.

In a 2011 BBC interview, Martin said: ""They had this wonderful charisma. They made you feel good to be with them. And I thought their music was rubbish.""

Martin signed the Beatles anyway, and came to love their songs. For the rest of the 1960s, he was their closest collaborator, producing almost all of the band's music, playing piano with them, writing their orchestral arrangements and figuring out how to turn John Lennon and Paul McCartney's wilder ideas into records.

In 2011, Martin described how he'd produced one of Lennon's signature songs:

""There was one time on 'Rain' when I decided to play around with tapes, and I took John's voice off as a separate item and put it on a quarter-inch tape and turned it back to front and slid it around a bit and then put it in on the end of the song. And I played it to John when he came back and he said, 'That's gear! What is it?' And I said, 'It's you!' And I explained to him what I'd done. And from that moment he wanted everything backward.""

When he wasn't in the studio with the Beatles, George Martin produced records by British pop acts like Cilla Black, Gerry and the Pacemakers and Shirley Bassey.

In 1977, while visiting the West Indies, Martin fell in love with the island of Montserrat. He built a recording complex for his company AIR Studios there with the money he'd made producing post-Beatles hits like the band America's ""Sister Golden Hair.""

AIR Studios Montserrat was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and Martin gradually retired from recording as hearing loss robbed him of his golden ears. His final hit song was the best-selling single of all time: a year after being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, he produced Elton John's ""Candle in the Wind 1997.""

""As a whole, I've had a wonderful life,"" Martin told the BBC in 1995. ""I've met the most wonderful people, worked with the greatest of artists. I'm very fortunate. I've got no gripes at all.""",[]

Unless Sen. Marco Rubio doffs a fedora and flings it into flag-festooned circle of red, white and blue balloons as fireworks go off and a band plays the national anthem, there is no need today to say he tossed his hat into the ring.

In fact, how about if we try to make it through the next few weeks or months without saying anyone tossed their hat into anything? (Unless, that is, were reporting about boxing  where the phrase originated.)

If you havent read the news we posted Thursday, please do. Click on these headlines:

- Editors Note: Ethics Violations Identified In Several NPR Music And WQXR Reports

- Stories By A Contributing Writer Published On NPR.org That Contain Plagiarism

- NPR Acknowledges Plagiarism In 10 Music Stories

The ombudsman has also posted:

- Plagiarism Found In 10 NPR Music Stories

Before describing how this situation was handled, we should note that the Ethics Handbook is clear: Plagiarism  taking someone elses work and intentionally presenting it as if it is your own  is theft. At NPR its an unforgivable offense.

The Handbook goes on to say:

That means no material from another source should ever be included verbatim, or substantially so, without attribution. This includes material from Associated Press reports. We do not, for example, produce news spots or other pieces that closely resemble wire service stories. NPRs standard is that our writing should be our own. There is no excuse for writing that repeats the wire stories that we use word-for-word, or nearly so.

Now, about how things were handled once we knew the extent of the problem.

We started from the position that when we make mistakes, we acknowledge them. Steps were taken to do that:

1. We stated as clearly as possible, in multiple places, what had happened and what we had done to correct the mistakes. Thats why there is an editors note signed by Mike Oreskes and WQXR General Manager Graham Parker, an editors note on top of the page where the stories in question were collected and editors notes on each of the 10 pages where the pieces originally appeared.

2. We did not try to hide the stories. They were all put on one page because we felt that would be a simple and user-friendly way to make them available to anyone who wanted to see what was in those pieces that had appeared elsewhere before.

3. We highlighted the words and phrases that had appeared elsewhere and linked to the places they had been drawn from. Again, we aimed to make it as simple as possible for anyone to see what had been done.

4. A headline and link to the main editors note was put on the NPR.org homepage.

5. The Two-Way was given no instructions other than to cover the news as it saw fit.

We will make mistakes, though hopefully none this serious. Steps similar to those taken in this situation may need to be repeated. Having them written down here may prove helpful in the future.

Before finishing, a couple more things should be noted.

The first sign that there was a problem came last Friday when copy editor Mark Mobley was checking an unusual spelling and came across a document with phrases much like those in the piece he was editing. He brought the duplication to the attention of editors at NPR Music. That was exactly the right thing to do. Mark was then asked to start going through the pieces the writer had done for NPR.org in the past. His research turned up the multiple examples.

Tom Huizenga, Jessica Goldstein and Jacob Ganz worked through this situation with what I would say was firm compassion. It is not easy to deal with news such as this when it involves a person you like and have enjoyed working with. They stayed focused on what was the right thing to do for NPR and its audience.

We all owe Mark, Tom, Jessica and Jacob a thanks.

What has happened to the GOP since it was trounced in the last presidential election? Henry Barbour, co-authored of the autopsy report, looks at whether his party paid attention to its conclusions.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Another round of presidential primaries has intensified the pressure on Republicans hoping to defeat Donald Trump. He won three primaries last night, including the big state of Michigan.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

Ted Cruz won a single state - Idaho. John Kasich won nowhere but had a strong showing in Michigan.

INSKEEP: Marco Rubio had one of his worst nights yet. He finished nowhere better than third and sometimes didn't even get 10 percent of the vote.

GREENE: We're going to talk through the Republican results and the future of the party with Henry Barbour. He is a Republican strategist, part of an important political family. He was co-author of a report trying to point the party in a new direction. He endorsed Marco Rubio and he's on the line now from Yazoo City, Miss. Good morning.

HENRY BARBOUR: Good morning.

INSKEEP: Got to ask you, what's wrong with your candidate?

BARBOUR: Well, look, every campaign has its ups and downs. And certainly Marco decided and the campaign decided to make a shift to focus on Florida, the 99 delegates. It's winner-take-all in Florida, is a win that he has to have. And so he's taken his positive and inspiring message to Florida, where we are going to vote next week on Tuesday, and what will be a blockbuster day for the campaign and a really decisive day for the campaign next Tuesday. Between now and next Tuesday, 433 delegates up for grabs. And 165 of them, between Ohio and Florida, are winner-take-all. So those are huge states.

INSKEEP: And you're sure that your candidate, Marco Rubio, will stay in the race through Florida, through that Tuesday result?

BARBOUR: Yeah, Marco is actually going to win next Tuesday. And certainly - look, the map was not good for him last night. And such is life. But in Florida, Sen. Rubio has been told before, look, you can't win. When he decided to run for the U.S. Senate the first time, he was told, you can't run. There's a sitting governor running for the Senate. And he took on the establishment. He was successful, had tea party support and did very well. And, you know, one of the things that's really positions him well in Florida is you've got about 60 percent, 65 percent of Republican voters voting against Donald Trump. So the vote in Florida for Marco Rubio essentially is you're a vehicle if you want to stop Donald Trump. And he has a big early vote advantage.

GREENE: Well, if - we want to turn to talk about Florida and that - sort of where the race is going. But let's hear first, if we can, you said the campaign is full of ups and downs. It was certainly an up moment for Donald Trump yesterday. And let's listen to our colleague Don Gonyea, who's been following the whole Republican race.

BARBOUR: Great.

DON GONYEA, BYLINE: There were some worrying signs for Donald Trump going into yesterday's primaries. His lead in national polls was narrowing. In primaries and caucuses over the weekend, he had not done as well as expected, especially among voters who decided late. But last night - well, last night looked a lot like Super Tuesday all over again. Here's how Trump described his challengers Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Marco Rubio.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: They didn't do so well tonight, folks, OK. I'm not going to say anybody didn't do well. They didn't do well. There's only one person did well tonight - Donald Trump. I will tell you. It's true.

(CHEERING)

GONYEA: Trump was declared the easy winner in the two biggest states yesterday - Michigan and Mississippi. All this despite a well-funded anti-Trump movement launched not just by his opponents but also by 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and super PACs that funded attack ads.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: And I don't think I've ever had so many horrible, horrible things said about me in one week.

(LAUGHTER)

TRUMP: Thirty-eight million dollars worth of horrible lies, but that's OK. It shows you how brilliant the public is.

GONYEA: Trumps remarks, delivered at Trump National Golf Club, sometimes felt more like an ad for Trump-branded products stacked high on a table by the stage where Trump Wine, Trump Steaks, Trump Water, Trump Magazine. It was a rebuttal to Romney, who in a speech this past week listed some of these same products as Trump business failures. As for the other candidates, Ted Cruz spoke to his supporters at a rally in North Carolina even before he'd finished second in Michigan and Mississippi and before he scored a late win in the Idaho primary.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TED CRUZ: There is only one campaign that has beaten Donald Trump repeatedly and that can and will beat Donald Trump in this nomination.

GONYEA: Ohio Gov. John Kasich, meanwhile, speaking in Columbus, put an upbeat spin on a disappointing showing in Michigan, a state where he worked harder than any other candidate.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOHN KASICH: Listen, we are very pleased with what's happened and when you think about where we've come.

GONYEA: A few weeks ago, Kasich was in single digits in Michigan. He rose to a very respectable 24 percent of the vote but still came in third just behind Cruz. For Kasich now, it's a last stand back home where Ohio holds a big winner-take-all primary next Tuesday.

KASICH: We're all familiar with March Madness. And now the home court advantage is coming North. And next week we are going to win the state of Ohio. It will be a...

(APPLAUSE)

GONYEA: Cruz and Kasich's goal now is to deny Trump the 1,237 delegate votes needed for nomination at this summer's GOP convention. That's the big hope for Sen. Marco Rubio, as well. But his once-promising campaign finished dead last in Michigan and Mississippi yesterday - stuck in single digits with no delegates won. He spoke to supporters before polls closed.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MARCO RUBIO: And in this election it is not just a choice between candidates. We are deciding the definition of what it means to be a conservative in the 21st century. And we are deciding our identity as a nation and as a people.

GONYEA: Rubio now needs a big win in his home state of Florida next Tuesday. But he'll have to score an upset to get it. Ultimately, the day belonged to Trump. As long as multiple opponents continue to split the opposing vote, he can continue to add to his triple-digit delegate lead.

GREENE: That is NPR's Don Gonyea. And we were listening to that story with Henry Barbour, who's on the line. And he's a Republican strategist.

i toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images

No matter where you are in Tucson, Ariz., you're no more than 20 miles from Saguaro National Park. The park and its tall, pronged, namesake cactus literally surround Tucson. There's the rounded top of the park's cactus-studded Wasson Peak to the west, the park's desert-to-forest Rincon Mountain Range to the east and about a million people living between.

But if you go around Tucson  to its historic barrio neighborhoods, swap meets or hiking trails  and ask people about their neighboring national park, you might be surprised.

""Saguaro High School?""

""I have no idea.""

""What's that?""

Darla Sidles, Saguaro National Park's superintendent, is not surprised by those responses. She knows better than most the disconnect that exists between a lot of locals here and the park next door. ""The type of people that are coming to the park versus the people just five minutes away in Tucson is really an issue for us here,"" she says.

The reason: The type of people that are coming to the park don't reflect the type of people living in the community. Tucson is about 44 percent Hispanic or Latino. Of the park's roughly 650,000 annual visitors, less than 2 percent self-identify as Hispanic. ""If we're not being relevant to almost half of the population, then 30, 40, 50 years from now, the park isn't going to matter to them,"" Sidles says.

A Call To Action

The disconnect between Tucson's minority populations and Saguaro National Park is striking given their proximity, but it's hardly unique.

The National Park Service overall has a diversity problem. There were a record 307.2 million visits to U.S. national parks in 2015, and it's fair to say that the majority of those visitors were white. The National Park Service doesn't track the demographics of its visitors, but the most recent survey commissioned by the Park Service to see how different populations groups related to the parks found that 9 percent of American visitors were Hispanic. African-Americans accounted for 7 percent. Asian-Americans were 3 percent. Collectively, minorities made up just over 20 percent of the visitors to national parks, despite the fact that they made up nearly 40 percent of the U.S. population.

toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR

""We know that visitation does not reflect the diversity of the nation,"" says Jon Jarvis, the director of the National Park Service. ""And that's a concern.""

It's a concern on multiple levels. For one, the national parks depend on public money, political support and community engagement for funding. The Census Bureau is projecting that non-whites will make up the majority of the U.S. population within the next 25 years. Urbanization is growing. And millennials are now the biggest generation in history. Add that all up and it's not hard to predict that multicultural, mostly-urban millennials ""will assume all seats of power and responsibilities for the nation,"" Jarvis says. ""So connecting to that generation is essential to the Park Service's ability to thrive in our second century.""

The other reason it's important to connect to all of America's shifting demographics, Jarvis says, is it's the Park Service's job. ""The Park Service has a responsibility that Congress and the president have granted us over our history,"" he says.

To that end, Jarvis has made increasing diversity at the national parks a top priority as the Park Service approaches its centennial. His Call to Action plan  a vision for the organization's future  states: ""In our second century, we will fully represent our nation's ethnically and culturally diverse communities.""

'This Is Not Your Space'



Figuring out why there's a disconnect between Tucson's minority groups and Saguaro National Park is about to be Cam Juarez's job. Juarez, from Tucson, is a leader in the Hispanic community serving on the city's school board. In a couple of weeks, he's going to start working for Saguaro National Park as their outreach coordinator.

toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR

Juarez getting a jump start on that by visiting a couple of schools in Tucson to ask parents, teachers, administrators and students if they know about Saguaro and, if not, why. He's also going to try to get them interested in the park and what it has to offer. ""It's like we're out there selling snake oil,"" he says on the way to a charter school in south Tucson, which is predominantly Hispanic. ""I'd wager to say that there's a whole lot of folks here that don't use the park, close as they are to it.""

In a way, Juarez is the perfect person for this job because he can relate. To date, he says, he's visited three national parks, including Saguaro. Growing up, his family never went to national parks. They never even talked about it. ""It just wasn't something we did,"" he says.

His family was poor. ""We didn't have camping gear or fishing gear,"" he says. ""We had hoes and shovels; work implements and school books.""

Even as he got older, Juarez says, he thought of national parks as a place for ""folks that were white or folks that had resources and sometimes you likened them to each other."" Either way, he didn't think the parks were for people like him.

He's not alone in that sentiment. That survey of park visitors released in 2011 found that non-whites were three times more likely to say that parks provide poor service and are not safe places to visit. And Juarez heard some of that at the schools he went to.

Oscar Medina, a teacher at Changemaker High School, talked about how he visited a park with his family ""and none of the information signs were in Spanish."" A mom at Carrillo Intermediate talked about how she wanted to go to Saguaro with her family, but there weren't facilities for a large group. Another pointed out there's no public transportation.

Some of the reasons were universal: the cost is prohibitive; not enough time because of work; the lack of shade in a desert park.

i toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR

Others were more subtle. Luis Perales, the chief academic officer at Changemaker High School, says that the reasons minorities, and particularly Latinos, aren't going to national parks is that ""spaces either are inviting or are rejecting in many ways. And I think a lot of what's been created [with national parks] is this idea that this is not your space.""

It's not that Latinos don't want to go outside. Go to any park or hiking trail in Tucson and you'll see that's not the case. It's that they might want to have a different experience in the outdoors. A lot of what the national parks promote is the solitude and quiet of a John Muir photo. ""Go out on your own, enjoy nature, don't harm it,"" Perales says. That messaging of ""rugged individualism"" doesn't necessarily work with Latinos, Perales says. ""It's like no, I'm going to bring my whole family, we're going to be loud, we're going to explore,"" he says. ""That's not what's promoted at this point. It has to be a compromise.""

'Reflect The Face Of The People We Want To Attract'

There's another reason that people gave for not feeling connected or welcome at the national parks, and it's one that many people danced around. Bella Furr, an intern and temporary worker at Saguaro National Park had no such qualms: ""The other thing is the Park Service is full of white men.""

That's not entirely accurate, but it's not far off the mark. According to the most recent survey, 80 percent of Park Service's roughly 22,000 employees are white. Anecdotally, people involved with the Park Service say, the demographics breakdown of the Park Service's estimated 220,000 volunteers is similar.

At Saguaro National Park, Sidles estimates about 75 percent of their workforce is white. ""We don't have as diverse a staff as we should have,"" she says. ""We have to reflect the face of the people we want to attract.""

That idea of reflecting the diversity of the public in its workforce is one the National Park Service has been pushing for a long time. Programs have been in put place nationally and initiatives have been launched, but little has changed. That's bred some cynicism about the service's efforts in some quarters. One former long-time National Park Service employee interviewed for this story not-so-jokingly said that the National Park Service could also be celebrating the centennial of its efforts to be more diverse.

There's a myriad of reasons park managers and officials give for the slow rate of change. There's the labyrinthian federal job application system as well as preferential hiring mandates that can keep the resumes of diverse, local candidates off of hiring manager's desks. More directly, there's low job turnover and few new opportunities for diverse candidates. With baby boomers nearing retirement though, that's expected to change and open opportunities for more diversity.

i toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR

Saguaro National Park wants to be ready for that opportunity and being ready means having young, diverse, experienced candidates for jobs as they come open. That's why they've partnered with the nonprofit group Friends of Saguaro National Park to hire a group of young locals like Yesenia Gamez on temporary contracts.

Gamez is what's called a Next Generation Ranger. She works at Saguaro National Park's visitor centers and in its interior, but she also works in Tucson, visiting local schools and working at information stands at local events.

On a recent weekend, she showed off a big bleached grizzly bear skull to a group of young kids at community health event at a park in downtown Tucson. They guessed what animal it was.

Gamez says she loves doing events like this because she gets to interact with people who otherwise don't get to experience the park. ""People that come to the park are usually retirees who can drive out there,"" she says. ""This is a low socioeconomic thing. It's in the heart of Tucson. It's kind of like we're bringing the park to them.""

By doing that, she says, the Next Gen Rangers can provide a friendly, familiar face and appeal to people where they're comfortable. They can also tell younger versions of themselves about the opportunities that exist in the National Park Service  if those opportunities exist.",[]
npr.org,2015-02-18 00:00:00,"Why you should always use ""transgender"" instead of ""transgendered""",['German Lopez'],"Questions of language are deeply ingrained in the fight for transgender rights and equality. It's not just a matter of being polite. If someone calls a trans man a woman, it fundamentally cuts against the person's gender identity.

But there are still big barriers, even among traditionally liberal media outlets, toward getting the basics of trans-inclusive vocabulary right. A recent story in the New Republic referred to trans people as ""transgendered,"" ""transman,"" and ""transwomen""  all of which are offensive to many trans people.

BuzzFeed LGBT Editor Saeed Jones echoed some of the offense in a recent tweet:

Also, its ""transgender,"" not ""transgendered."" ""Transgendered"" is the linguistic equivalent of describing someone as ""blacked.""  Saeed Jones (@theferocity) February 17, 2015

Getting this right isn't just a matter of being inclusive toward trans people, although that should be reason enough. It can also help readers become familiar with the correct terms.

As New York Times Public Editor Margaret Sullivan explained last week, one of the major challenges for news outlets is that most readers just aren't familiar with how to correctly refer to people with non-traditional gender identities. And in some cases, referring to someone with the correct terms can be a little confusing  calling Chelsea Manning, a transgender soldier who's in prison for leaking secret US documents, ""she"" after years of addressing her in news stories as ""he"" may have confused some readers, even though using the correct pronoun for Manning is the right editorial call.

Of course, there are ways around this. A writer could explain what the terms mean within a story. News outlets could link readers to clear definitions, similar to what BuzzFeed does with its house style guide. Stories could also point readers to more in-depth glossaries, like the GLAAD Media Reference Guide or UC Berkeley Gender Equity Resource Center's definition of terms.

Most importantly, media outlets have to first get the terms right for themselves. But two common mistakes persist, as seen in the New Republic's use of the terms ""transgendered,"" ""transman,"" and ""transwoman."" Here's why those terms are not just inaccurate but can cause such great offense when they're used.

Transgender vs. transgendered

The umbrella term for people who identify with a gender different than the one assigned to them at birth is ""transgender"" or ""trans."" These words are adjectives, not nouns. Additionally, the word ""transgendered"" is offensive to trans people and unnecessarily confusing.

As trans advocate Joanne Herman noted in the Huffington Post, calling someone transgendered is a bit like calling someone ""colored."" ""One problem with this label was that it implied something happened to make the person 'of color,' which denied the person's dignity of being born that way,"" Herman wrote. Similarly, transgendered suggests that being trans is something that happens to someone, as opposed to an identity someone is born with.

The implication behind transgendered flies in the face of science: people can know their gender identity at a very young age. A recent study from the TransYouth Project found that transgender children as young as five years old respond to psychological gender-association tests, which evaluate how people view themselves within gender roles, as quickly and consistently as those who don't identify as trans.

Transgendered is also unnecessarily long and confusing. LGBT group GLAAD explained: ""The adjective transgender should never have an extraneous '-ed' tacked onto the end. An '-ed' suffix adds unnecessary length to the word and can cause tense confusion and grammatical errors. It also brings transgender into alignment with lesbian, gay, and bisexual. You would not say that Elton John is 'gayed' or Ellen DeGeneres is 'lesbianed,' therefore you would not say Chaz Bono is 'transgendered.'""

Trans men and trans women vs. transmen and transwomen

A trans man is someone who identifies as a man but was designated female at birth. A trans woman is someone who identifies as a woman but was designated male at birth. Some trans people prefer to leave the word transgender or trans out altogether, since they only identify as a man or woman.

Writers shouldn't use ""transman"" or ""transwoman."" The word trans is an adjective that helps describe someone's gender identity, and it should be treated like other adjectives. Merging the adjective and the noun risks suggesting that a trans man or woman is more (or less) than just a man or just a woman, which goes against how many trans people identify themselves.

npr.org,,Dont Be Careless With The Word Countless,[],"Dont Be Careless With The Word Countless

Its tempting to say that weve used one word a countless number of times.

But that would be wrong, because we can quantify it:

 Countless showed up 255 times in the past year on NPR.org.

 The word is in 112 broadcast transcripts from that same period.

There are two points to make about this:

 We (and our guests) use the word too much. We cannot have found that many things that qualify as countless.

 We (and our guests) often misuse the word, either because what were talking about can be counted or because a better word would paint a clearer picture. Countless just ends up sounding like a throwaway word that conveys little information.

This is the point in this post where we should go the dictionary. The adjective countless is defined as too many to count; innumerable; myriad. If you want to make the case that youre using it as a synonym for myriad, please be prepared to prove that youre speaking of an indefinitely large number.

A pretty good use of the word was a reference we made to the countless other people around the world who showed support for the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists. That group could be considered an indefinitely large number. (Might millions have been a better word? Theres a case to be made that the answer is yes.)

A poor use of the word was this headline: The Countless Lives Of Lauren Bacall. The appreciation of her life that ran with the headline details about a dozen times she reinvented herself. Thats not indefinitely large.

What to say instead? A look through our reports shows that, depending on the context, more precise words would have included:

 Many

 Dozens

 Hundreds

 Thousands

 Millions

 Billions

By the way, it is not a job requirement that reporters covering the 2016 campaign always put countless before the words handshakes, pork chops, county fairs, town halls and stump speeches.

SALIE: The Vatican has a confession to make. For the past two and a half weeks, tourists have encountered scaffolding obscuring Raphael's most famous work ""The School Of Athens."" Museum officials were hoping disappointed art lovers would just assume that the restoration of the masterpiece is on Italian time. But when recently pressed to explain the delay, Romia Cametti, chief of the Vatican Laboratories of Restoration, admitted to the media that her lab engineers have run out of paint. Specifically, the paint needed to touch up Socrates' amber robe. You see, by the laws of their own municipality, Vatican restoration artists must work with the exact same pigment that Raphael used. Problem is the only way to produce that particular color is to mix Persian saffron with the poop of an endangered species called the Tuscan turtledove. The Vatican has only one such dove in captivity, and he named Rocco. And Rocco is well, constipated...

SALIE: Or (foreign language spoken) as they say. Dramatic appeals have been made to his bowels, including around-the-clock rosary circle prayed by the sisters of perpetual regularity.

In an official statement, Disney has claimed that Eeyore suffers from depression.

POUNDSTONE: He has been put on mandatory unpaid leave and required to seek counseling and a more permanent tail repair.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Eeyore misbehaving at Disney World. Their excuse - he's depressed. Your last story of someone telling the truth - they swear - comes from Roy Blount, Jr.

ROY BLOUNT, JR.: Citizens of Brussels, Belgium, want to know why is Brussels' motor vehicle traffic so chaotic, so prone to gridlock? Officials of Brussels answer mice. What, too many mice on the roads? No, it's because some many of our underground tunnels are crumbling. And that's caused by - mice. Mice? Mice ate the tunnels? No, mice ate the plans - the master plans that could have been used to repair the crumbling tunnels.

(LAUGHTER)

BLOUNT: You know, you store master plans away inside a pier, under a viaduct for 20 years and then you go find them and mice already have. Well, this explanation has inspired a rich strain of mirth in Belgium and especially in neighboring France, where even Belgian people are regarded as comical. And blame it on the mice jokes abound. Unfortunately, to American ears, all these jokes sound like mice speaking untranslatable Walloon-inflected French, sort of like (foreign language spoken, laughter).

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So here are the three stories.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: I will present them to you, Jay, in the form of the excuse. Was it from Faith - oh, I'm sorry we can't finish the restoration of this famous painting because we don't have the paint because the birds won't poop, from Paula Poundstone - oh, I'm sorry, Eeyore was behaving badly here at Disney World; he was just really depressed or from Roy Blount Jr. - oh, we can't fix the infrastructure here in Brussels. The mice ate all the plans? Which of these was the real excuse offered this week?

STEWART: I really want A to be the truth.

SAGAL: You want the story of the poop paint in Rome?

SALIE: God bless you, Jay.

SAGAL: The pontiff's poop paint, in fact.

STEWART: I change a lot of diapers.

SAGAL: I understand.

SAGAL: All right, well, that's your choice. Let's hear from somebody who knows a little bit about this real excuse.

NIRAJ CHOKSHI: When they went back 20 years later, they couldn't find the plans. His best guess as to what happened was that they were eaten by mice.

SAGAL: That was Niraj Chokshi. That's the journalist who wrote about the Belgian mice for The Washington Post. So I'm sorry, you didn't win. But you earned a point for Faith, which might have been your intent, I think, judging the way you approached this. So thank you for doing that. Thanks so much for playing, Jay, good-bye.

Since we started making Tiny Desk Concerts almost eight years ago, we've had more than 500 artists play the Tiny Desk, our own little makeshift concert venue right in the middle of NPR's offices in DC. From huge stars like Adele to T-Pain to up-and-comers like Car Seat Headrest and actual big bands like Mucca Pazza, all these musicians actually play behind MY desk  but I move out of the way when they set up.

This is one of the things that always surprises people when they visit NPR: that the Tiny Desk isn't a set. So we decided to give everyone a peek behind the scenes on a Monday afternoon earlier this month, when Wilco just happened to be stopping by.

We invited a company called RYOT to bring two 360-degree cameras to our offices and put them right in the front row of the audience. Then we filmed the whole thing, starting before Wilco even set up, before the staff flocked from all over the building to see the band play. Not only can you see the band up close, but if you look around, you'll see everything else that goes into making a Tiny Desk concert. You'll see our brilliant and calm engineer, Josh Rogosin. You'll see our lead videographer and producer of Tiny Desk Concerts, Niki Walker, along with her intern, Kara Frame. Then, of course, there's the crowd  what a lucky bunch. Many of them work here, many are lucky friends of people who work here. You'd probably recognize some of the voices in this radio crowd.

If you've never watched a 360-degree video before, we can help. There's lots to look around and spot  in fact, if you look really carefully, you might be able to find seven of Wilco's album covers around the desk and references to each one that we hid in the crowd. And of course, enjoy the song itself, one of Wilco's unforgettable tunes, ""Misunderstood"" from the 1996 album Being There. In front starting from the left you'll see Mikael Jorgensen playing the melodica, Nels Cline on that resonator guitar, Jeff Tweedy singing and strumming, John Stirratt playing guitar and singing strongly alongside Jeff and Pat Sansone on banjo and glockenspiel. In the back, holding it all together and sometimes tearing it apart, is drummer Glenn Kotche.

And when you're all done here, you can watch Wilco play all four of the songs they performed at this Tiny Desk concert. For those of us here at NPR, you can guess how boring the day seemed after this.",[]

i Matailong Du/NPR Matailong Du/NPR

In 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, by a vote of 8 to 1, to uphold a state's right to forcibly sterilize a person considered unfit to procreate. The case, known as Buck v. Bell, centered on a young woman named Carrie Buck, whom the state of Virginia had deemed to be ""feebleminded.""

Author Adam Cohen tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that Buck v. Bell was considered a victory for America's eugenics movement, an early 20th century school of thought that emphasized biological determinism and actively sought to ""breed out"" traits that were considered undesirable.

""There were all kinds of categories of people who were deemed to be unfit [to procreate],"" Cohen says. ""The eugenicists looked at evolution and survival of the fittest, as Darwin was describing it, and they believed 'We can help nature along, if we just plan who reproduces and who doesn't reproduce.' ""

All told, as many as 70,000 Americans were forcibly sterilized during the 20th century. The victims of state-mandated sterilization included people like Buck who had been labeled ""mentally deficient,"" as well as those who who were deaf, blind and diseased. Minorities, poor people and ""promiscuous"" women were often targeted.

Cohen's new book about the Buck case, Imbeciles, takes its name from the terms eugenicists used to categorize the ""feebleminded."" In it, he revisits the Buck v. Bell ruling and explores the connection between the American eugenics movement and the rise of the Nazi party in Germany.

Cohen notes that the instinct to ""demonize"" people who are different is still prevalent in the U.S. today, particularly in the debate over immigration.

""I think these instincts to say that we need to stop these other people from 'polluting us,' from changing the nature of our country, they're very real,"" Cohen warns. ""The idea that those who don't remember the past are condemned to repeat it  it's very troubling that we don't remember this past.""

Interview Highlights

On the case of Carrie Buck

This is this poor young woman, really nothing wrong with her physically or mentally, a victim of a terrible sexual assault, and there's a little hearing, she's declared feebleminded and she gets sent off to the colony for epileptics and feebleminded. ...

Imbeciles The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck by Adam Cohen Hardcover, 402 pages | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

When she's at the colony, the guy who is running the colony, Dr. Albert Priddy, is on the prowl. He's looking for someone to put at the center of this test case that they want to bring, so he's looking for someone to sterilize, and he sees Carrie Buck when she comes in, he does the examination himself, and there are a lot of things about her that excite him. She is deemed to be feebleminded, she has a mother who is feebleminded, so that's good because you can show some genetics, and then they're hoping that [her] baby could be determined to be feebleminded too, then you could really show a genetic pattern of feeblemindedness. The fact that she had been pregnant out of wedlock was another strike against her. So he fixes on her and thinks Carrie Buck is going to be the perfect potential plaintiff. ...

He chooses her, and then under the Virginia law, they have to have a sterilization hearing at the colony, which they do and they give her a lawyer (who is really not a lawyer for her; it's really someone who had been the chairman of the board of the colony and was sympathetic to the colony's side) and they have a bit of a sham hearing where she is determined to be a suitable person for sterilization; they vote to sterilize her, and that is the order that then gets challenged by Carrie as the plaintiff first in the Virginia court system and then in the Supreme Court.

On why he considers Buck v. Bell to be one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in American history

If you start by just looking at all the human misery that was inflicted, about 70,000 Americans were sterilized as a result of this decision, so that's an awful lot of people who wanted to have children who weren't able to have children. Also, we have to factor in all the many people who were being segregated, who were being held in these institutions for eugenic reasons, because they were feebleminded, whose lives unfolded living in places like the colony, rather than living in freedom. Beyond the human effect though, there was something just so ugly about this decision and when [we] think about what we want the Supreme Court to be, what the founders wanted the Supreme Court to be, it was supposed to be our temple of justice, the place that people could go when all the other parts of our society, all the other parts of the government, were not treating them right.

On how eugenicists sought to address the ""threat"" to the gene pool

The eugenicists saw two threats to the national gene pool: One was the external one, which they were addressing through immigration law; the other was the internal one  what to do about the people who were already here. They had a few ideas.

The first eugenics law in the United States was passed in Connecticut in 1895, and it was a law against certain kinds of marriages. They were trying to stop certain unfit people from reproducing through marriage. It wasn't really what they wanted, though, because they realized that people would just reproduce outside of marriage.

So their next idea was what they called segregation. The idea was to get people who were deemed unfit institutionalized during their reproductive years, particularly for women, keep them there, make sure they didn't reproduce, and then women were often let go when they had passed their reproductive years because they were no longer a threat to the gene pool. That had a problem too, though. The problem was that it would be really expensive to segregate, institutionalize the number of people the eugenicists were worried about. ...

Their next idea was eugenic sterilization and that allowed for a model in which they would take people in to institutions, eugenically sterilize them, and then they could let them go, because they were no longer a threat. That's why eugenic sterilization really became the main model that the eugenicists embraced and that many states enacted laws to allow.

On deeming people ""feebleminded""

""Feebleminded"" was really the craze in American eugenics. There was this idea that we were being drowned in a tide of feeblemindedness  that basically unintelligent people were taking over, reproducing more quickly than the intelligent people  but it was also a very malleable term that was used to define large categories of people that again, were disliked by someone who was in the decision-making position. So, women who were thought to be overly interested in sex, licentious, were sometimes deemed feebleminded. It was a broad category and it was very hard to prove at one of these feeblemindedness hearings that you were not feebleminded.

On the involuntary sterilization procedure

For men it was something like a vasectomy. For women it was a salpingectomy, where they cauterized the path that the egg takes toward fertilization. It was, in the case of women, not minor surgery and when you read about what happened, it's many, many days of recovery and it had certain dangers attached to it, and a lot of the science was still quite new. ...

When you add onto all that, the fact that in many, many cases the women involved were not told what was being done to them, they might be told that they were having an appendectomy, they weren't being told that the government has decided that you are unfit to reproduce and we're then going to have surgery on you, so that just compounds the horror of the situation.

On how the Nazis borrowed from the U.S. eugenics sterilization program

We really were on the cutting edge. We were doing a lot of this in the 1910s and 1920s. Indiana adopted a eugenic sterilization law, America's first in 1907. We were writing the eugenics sterilization statutes that decided who should be sterilized. We also had people who were writing a lot of what might be thought of as pro-Aryan theory. So you have people like Madison Grant who wrote a very popular book called The Passing of a Great Race, which really talked about the superiority of Nordics, as he called them, and how they were endangered by all the brown people and the non-Nordics who were taking over.

On a 1924 immigration law, which was inspired by eugenicists, that prevented Anne Frank's family from entering the U.S.

Under the old immigration laws where it was pretty much ""show up,"" they would've been able to emigrate, but suddenly they were trapped by very unfavorable national quotas, so this really was a reason that so many Jews were turned away.

One very poignant aspect of it that I've thought about as I was working on the book is in the late '90s some correspondence appeared, was uncovered, in which Otto Frank was writing repeatedly to the State Department begging for visas for himself and his wife and his two daughters, Margot and Anne, and was turned down, and that was because there were now these quotas in place. If they had not been, it seems clear that he would've been able to get a visa for his whole family, including his daughter Anne Frank.

So when we think about the fact that Anne Frank died in a concentration camp, we're often told that it was because the Nazis believed the Jews were genetically inferior, that they were lesser than Aryans. That's true, but to some extent Anne Frank died in a concentration camp because the U.S. Congress believed that as well.",[]

Democrat Cory Booker, formerly the mayor of Newark, is now a senator and a frequent entry on ""Washington's Most Eligible Bachelors"" lists. We've invited him to play a game called ""New Jersey? I prefer Old Jersey!"" Three questions about old sports jerseys.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

And now the game where we ask important people about very unimportant things. Sen. Cory Booker began his public career as mayor of Newark, a city that people said could never come back. But he went there, and he famously repainted the entire city - himself. That got him elected to the U.S. Senate. He joins us now from a terminal at Washington National Airport. Sen. Cory Booker, welcome to WAIT WAIT... DONT TELL ME.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: So - so you grew up in New Jersey - as I did - and both of us got out. And you went back. What brought you back? Did someone have some dirt on you?

CORY BOOKER: (Laughter) Listen, don't get my Jersey pride going. We are the most densely-populated state in America 'cause some many people who know the secret want to live there.

SAGAL: Oh, is that why?

BOOKER: Yes.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So you were - you became the mayor of Newark as a relatively young man. And Newark at that time did not have a good reputation.

BOOKER: No. I think that was one of the problems. We were one of America's most underestimated cities. It was a city that had a lot of challenges. But after all eight years of work, it's had its biggest economic development boom in 60 years. I'm really proud.

SAGAL: Yeah, yeah, that's so great. Tell us about the Hot Pockets.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: No because I - this is - one of the great things about your career as the mayor of Newark is you were constantly, like, doing stuff for people. You were out shoveling walks and - but there was an incident during - it was during Hurricane Sandy, right?

BOOKER: Sometimes I'd get the strangest requests. And during Hurricane Sandy - I couldn't believe it, but I saw somebody tweet me and asked me to bring them some Hot Pockets. So I jokingly told them hey, this is a problem you can handle. I believe in you. But the next thing I knew, the company Hot Pockets sent me a thousand free coupons for Hot Pockets, which I donated to a food pantry, except for I gave a few to the young man who was bold enough in the midst of a hurricane to ask me for Hot Pockets.

SAGAL: Did you ever actually stop a crime in progress, like Batman?

BOOKER: I am definitely not Batman. And in fact, as I write about in my book, I did stupid things. So yeah, a couple of times I got involved in some foot chases and other incidents.

SAGAL: Oh, wait a minute, like what?

BOOKER: Well, in my first couple weeks in office, I was coming out of City Hall and there was an armed bank robbery going on. And so I gave chase to the robber who had just held up a woman who was making a deposit. Then he got caught by a police officer, swung at him with his knife. Thank God it only ripped his shirt. And I came upon the situation while the officer had drawn his gun on a crowded sidewalk and just thought to myself this is a bad situation. And very imprudently, I decided I didn't want the officer to shoot so that I would sprint at the man with the knife. And he fortunately did what I hoped he would do, which is not to stand there but actually turn and run.

SAGAL: Wait a minute.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So - so a few moments ago when I asked you if you ever actually prevented a crime and you said no, what you really meant was yes that you actually...

BOOKER: No.

SAGAL: ...Apprehended a bank robber.

BOBCAT GOLDTHWAIT: No, he said he's not Batman.

(LAUGHTER)

ADAM BURKE: Now that's government in action.

SAGAL: It really is.

BOOKER: Yes, yes.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: But that sounds like fun. So now you're in the Senate. How miserable is that, Sen. Booker?

BOOKER: Well (laughter) it's a lot easier to chase down Mitch McConnell then it is...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So...

BOOKER: No, it's - look, it's a challenge. We have a government that has problems that are well-celebrated. But despite all that, you know, I've gotten legislation passed with everybody from Ted Cruz to even today worked with Marco Rubio and Cory Gardner.

SAGAL: Wait a minute, Marco Rubio was there?

BOOKER: No, but we have legislation together.

SAGAL: All right, so you've worked with Ted Cruz. I have to say - I've never met the man; I've read a lot about him; he doesn't seem popular with his colleagues. Do you get along with him? Do you like him?

BOOKER: You know, in America, our differences matter but our country matters more. That's the attitude I wanted to take to the Senate. And it's been fruitful so far in the first few years.

SAGAL: So what I feel you're saying - what I feel you're saying, senator, is that he's a total jerk face.

(LAUGHTER)

ROXANNE ROBERTS: No Peter, what the senator is too modest to say is that everybody likes him. He likes everybody. He's little Mr. Sunshine. He's gorgeous.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Hang on a second. Now, you actually - Roxanne, thank you for bringing this up - Sen. Booker, you were one of Town & Country Magazine's Top 40 Bachelors. You were named that. You're a well-known single man about town in Washington. What's it like - what's it like in Washington, you know, when the world is your oyster, you've got no strings attached?

BOOKER: Well, it's not the best thing. I don't recommend it if you want a date to be a United States senator. There are definitely a lot of constrictions. It's not the kind of job where you just jump on, you know, match.com or Tinder or something like that and try to meet people. It's...

SAGAL: Why not? Can you imagine how exciting that would be for the young ladies of Washington to be looking at their Tinder and going oh my God, it's Cory Booker - right, right, right, right.

BURKE: Also - also, think back to your mayor days when you showed up at peoples' front door with a present. Like, just do that.

(LAUGHTER)

BOOKER: I have a feeling that this whole conversation my mom put you up to it.

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

BOOKER: You know, this is taking a turn in a direction I did not (unintelligible).

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: No, no, no, can you tell us what you're looking for? Maybe we can find out if one of our - I'm guessing if you like people who listen to NPR, we can help you out.

BOOKER: Well, can I tell you about criminal just reform or tax reform instead?

SAGAL: Yeah, yeah, I think a lot of people listening just decided to maybe go hit on the Dick Durbin instead.

SAGAL: Well, Sen. Cory Booker, what a pleasure to talk to you. We've asked you here to play a play game called...

BILL KURTIS: New Jersey? I Prefer Old Jersey.

BOOKER: Oh.

SAGAL: Yes, senator, you're a life-long resident and champion in New Jersey. But what do you know about old jersey, specifically old sports jerseys? Answer two of our three questions correctly, you'll win our prize for one of our listeners - Carl Kasell's voice on their voicemail. Bill, who is Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey playing for?

KURTIS: Gary Currier of Oregon City, Ore.

BOOKER: All right, I'm ready.

SAGAL: Fans love - love - the jerseys of their favorite players. You know that. One fan expressed his fandom in a very sincere way. What was it? A, one Christopher Lackner of Chicago, Ill., every day has his wife shave the number 34 into his back hair, in honor of the late Walter Payton, B, in 2005, a prisoner successfully lobbied to have his prison sentence raised from 30 to 33 years in honor of number 33 Larry Bird, or C, an Atlantan named BJ Maxwell only dates women who are 31 years old in honor of number 31 on the Braves, Greg Maddux.

BOOKER: Wow, OK.

(LAUGHTER)

BOOKER: I cannot believe I'm saying these two words on a national radio show - back hair.

SAGAL: You're going to go for the guy who has the number 34 shaved into his back to honor sweetness, Walter Payton?

BOOKER: Yes.

SAGAL: No. I'm afraid no. It was actually the prisoner.

(LAUGHTER)

BOOKER: It was a guy in Oklahoma, and he got sentenced to 30 years. And he said no, I want 33 'cause he said if I was going to go down, he was going to go down in Larry Bird's jersey number. All right, you still have two more chances here, senator.

BOOKER: OK, this is pressure. Go ahead.

SAGAL: Yeah. There are tributes out there to athlete's jersey numbers that you may not know about, such as one of these. Is it A, Colt 45 malt liquor named not for the famous gun but for football player Jerry Hill, number 45 for the Baltimore Colts, B, Heinz 57, named for Pittsburgh Pirates legend Frank Bork, or C, Adele's record ""21,"" which she named for Manchester United star footballer Ander Herrera.

BOOKER: Wow, wow. I've always thought Colt 45 was the weapon, and I would love the opportunity to talk with you about sensible gun safety.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: You know...

BURKE: Nicely done.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Sen. Booker - Sen. Booker, no offense but as we talk, I'm getting a clear idea of why you're single.

(LAUGHTER)

BOOKER: I'm really disappointed you don't think infrastructure is sexy.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, so you were just about to make your choice. So which is it going to be?

BOOKER: I'm going to go with the Colt 45 with the understanding that we're going to do more to get guns out of the hands of...

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: You are...

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: You are incorrigible, sir. You're also right.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: It turns out - we were surprised, too.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Colt 45 named not for the gun but for a Baltimore Colts star of yesteryear, number 45. All right, last question. If you get this right, you win. Archie Manning - he's the father of Peyton and Eli Manning and some other more boring kids. He wore number 18 when he was a football star at Ole Miss, a fact everyone there in Oxford still remembers. Why? A, because they carved the number 18 into the back of Jefferson Davis' jacket on his statue in the middle of campus, B, because the campus speed limit at Ole Miss is at an annoyingly-slow 18 miles per hour in his honor or C, because to this day you can buy his favorite meal - a dozen boiled crawfish and a can of Abita beer for 18 cents.

BOOKER: Wow. OK, well, number one is definitely not it. And in this day and age in America and our economy, I don't think you can get much for 18 cents anymore. So I'm going to stick with traffic safety 'cause it might give me a chance to talk about the importance of infrastructure.

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: That's amazing.

SAGAL: You - honestly, Sen. Booker, you are unstoppable. And you are right. The answer was the speed limit...

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: And not only has it been 18 for years because of Archie Manning, in 2012, it was slowed down to honor his son, who wore number 10. And drivers were not happy. Bill, how did Sen. Booker do on our quiz?

KURTIS: He won - 2 out of 3, senator. Congratulations.

SAGAL: Thank you, very well done.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Cory Booker's book ""United"" is out now. Sen. Cory Booker, thank you so much for joining us here on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.

BOOKER: Thank you.

SAGAL: Thank you, sir. Take care.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""I LIKE JERSEY BEST"")

JOHN PIZZARELLI: (Singing) I've been a lot of places, seen pictures of the rest. But of all the places I can think of, I like Jersey best.

SAGAL: In just a minute, you can fly like an eagle in our Listener Limerick Challenge. Call 1-888-WAIT-WAIT to join us on the air. We'll be back with more of WAIT WAIT... DONT TELL ME from NPR.

i toggle caption Jeffrey Vock/Getty Images Jeffrey Vock/Getty Images

Pat Conroy, the beloved author of The Great Santini, The Lords of Discipline and The Prince of Tides, has died. Conroy  who announced last month that he had pancreatic cancer  died Friday night at his home among his family in Beaufort, S.C. He was 70 years old.

Pat Conroy was a master storyteller, blending the raw material of his difficult family life with the landscape of coastal South Carolina. In 1986, Conroy told me that the reason he wrote was to explain his own life to himself.

""Writing has been not therapeutic for me, but it has been essential,"" he said in an interview for Morning Edition. ""I have written about my mother, my father, my family ... and if I get it on paper, I have named the demon.""

Conroy's best known work is The Prince of Tides, a novel about a troubled South Carolina native recounting his story to a New York psychiatrist.

The prologue begins: ""My wound is geography.""

I was born and raised on a Carolina sea island and I carried the sunshine of the low country, inked in dark gold, on my back and shoulders. As a boy I was happy above the channels, navigating a small boat between the sandbars with their quiet nation of oysters exposed on the brown flats at the low watermark.

Nan Talese was Pat Conroy's editor for the past 35 years, beginning with The Prince of Tides  a span that saw Conroy's book sales rise to a total of 20 million copies worldwide.

She recalled the first thing he said to her when they met. ""He said, 'I will tell you, if there are ten words for something, I will use all ten. Your job is to take them out.'""

Talese said Conroy touched people with his language and his honesty.

""His incredible sense of empathy with people. ... I think that his books influenced a lot of people because he was so open and honest. And it really struck their hearts.""

Pat Conroy was born in 1945 in Atlanta. He was a self-described ""military brat."" His family moved every year until they settled in Beaufort when he was 12.

YouTube

In his 1976 book The Great Santini, Conroy wrote about his relationship with his abusive father, a Marine aviator. In the 1979 film version of the story, the father is played by Robert Duvall. In one scene, he addresses his four young children after a move, as if they are soldiers under his command.

After high school, Pat Conroy's father sent his oldest son to The Citadel, Charleston's storied military academy, where Pat began to write fiction. Conroy said his natural storytelling ability was never affected by literary theory.

""I missed all the classes in the art of fiction,"" Conroy said in 1986. ""We didn't have any. I'm great on military science. But I missed all the classes on 'Is this a great technique for fiction?' I never learned any of that stuff.""

His education as a writer came elsewhere.

""I came from a family of great storytellers,"" he said. ""That is something about the South I think has been preserved.

And he said he faced challenges along the way. ""The one thing I've had is a very painful life filled with utter moments of great joy. Things happen to me for reasons I cannot figure out. And things have continued to happen to me all my life, and happen to my family all my life, and now happen to my friends. ...

Iran's military tested two ballistic missiles Wednesday, and an Iranian officer says the missiles are designed to reach Israel, according to an Iranian news agency. Iran has conducted a number of other ballistic missile tests this week.

The tests, which come after Iran won sanctions relief in January by curbing its nuclear program, seem to be ""aimed at demonstrating that Iran will push forward with its ballistic program,"" The Associated Press reports.

NPR's Peter Kenyon tells our Newscast unit that ""the tests may violate a U.N. Security Council resolution barring Iran from test-firing missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons."" Here's more from Peter:

""Iran says its missiles aren't designed for nuclear weapons. The U.S. says Iran's missile program is not part of last year's nuclear agreement, but Iran has warned that any new sanctions could mean an end to the deal.""

Iran's Press TV has video of the ballistic missile launch on its website. You can watch it here.

As Reuters reports, ""the missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran."" Additionally, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ""maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East.""

Iran denies that this test was ""provocative,"" according to the wire service.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest told journalists that the reported missile launches underscore the importance of the nuclear deal with Iran. ""Iran is working aggressively to try to enhance their ballistic missile capability, and preventing them from being able to nuclearize their missiles is  is obviously important to our national security here in the United States,"" he says.

Earnest adds that it ""would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days.""

NPR's Michele Kelemen says the State Department and the White House are taking a ""cautious line"" on the missile test. The State Department says ""Secretary of State John Kerry raised this in a phone call with his Iranian counterpart,"" Michele reports.

Hillary Clinton took a harder line than the current administration. She said in a statement that Iran's ""blatant violation"" of the Security Council resolution should have ""consequences."" She adds: ""Iran should face sanctions for these activities, and the international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats toward Israel will not be tolerated.""",[]

A NASA mission to Mars that was originally scheduled to launch this month  then was canceled when a flaw was discovered in a pivotal piece of equipment  is back on the calendar. If all goes well, it will launch in 2018.

The InSight mission  or ""Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport"" mission  has been in the works since 2012. It will send a lander to the Red Planet to measure Mars' seismic activity and interior temperature, among other things.

Data on marsquakes and the planet's interior heat will help researchers better understand Mars' ""deep interior,"" NASA says. That, in turn, could help expand scientists' understanding of the formation of all rocky planets, including Earth.

The original launch was planned for March 2016. But in December, the mission had to be suspended because a flaw in the lander's French-built seismometer couldn't be fixed in time.

The instrument needs to work inside a vacuum ""to provide the exquisite sensitivity needed for measuring ground movements as small as half the radius of a hydrogen atom,"" NASA says  and the container needed to maintain that vacuum was leaking.

At the time, it wasn't clear if the mission would be postponed or called off altogether. But on Wednesday, NASA announced that it would resume work on the project.

No matter how quickly the vacuum issue is resolved, March 5, 2018, is the earliest the mission could launch. That window of opportunity depends on the alignment of the orbits of Earth and Mars.

The InSight mission is a part of NASA's Discovery Program, in which scientists compete for approval of relatively low-cost planetary missions. (The total cost of InSight was to be capped at $675 million, Science Magazine reported last December. At that time, NASA had already spent $525 million, and the space agency is currently assessing the cost added by the two-year delay.)

When InSight was picked, it beat out two other finalists  one that would have sent a probe to a comet to hop across its surface and study multiple locations, and another that would have sent a boat to Titan, one of the moons of Saturn, to travel across its hydrocarbon oceans.

NASA is currently in the process of selecting the next Discovery Program mission  or missions  from a set of five finalists, including projects studying Venus and a probe to land on a metallic asteroid.

NASA had originally suggested it might select two winners, instead of just one, this year. It's not yet clear if InSight's rescheduled launch will affect that decision or any other planned NASA missions.",[]

The presidential campaign, particularly the debates, and breaking news events such as this weeks mass shooting in Oregon draw many of us to social media. We want to monitor the news, post our reporting, share the interesting information we find and offer our thoughts.

Thats great. Have fun out there.

But ... (theres always a but) ... all of us  journalists as well as those in other departments  need to remember that what we post and retweet can reflect on NPR. None of us want NPRs reputation for fairness to be put in doubt because of things we do on digital platforms.

Weve issued guidance on this before. Everyone is expected to be familiar with our thinking. Please reread:

 The Social Media section of the handbook. The introduction specifically mentions NPRs journalists, but the principles apply to others here as well. If youre in doubt, talk to your supervisor:

The Internet and the social media communities it encompasses can be incredible resources. They offer both a remarkably robust amount of historical material and an incredible amount of real-time reporting from people at the scenes of breaking news events. But they also present new and unfamiliar challenges, and they tend to amplify the effects of any ethical misjudgments you might make. So tread carefully. Conduct yourself online just as you would in any other public circumstances as an NPR journalist. Treat those you encounter online with fairness, honesty and respect, just as you would offline. Verify information before passing it along. Be honest about your intent when reporting. Avoid actions that might discredit your professional impartiality. And always remember, you represent NPR.

i toggle caption Sony Pictures Television Sony Pictures Television

Visiting the set of a historical drama can be a surreal experience, and Underground was no exception.

As the Louisiana sun beat down on an actual historical plantation near Baton Rouge last July, director Kate Woods oversaw a scene where an adorable small boy  actor Maceo Smedley  is picking cotton.

""Could someone go and put more blood on his hands?"" she shouted.

The second the filming stopped, someone dashed over with an umbrella to protect the 8-year-old from the stultifying heat, while the extras playing female field workers pulled bottles of Gatorade and cellphones from their 18th-century skirts.

Underground premieres on the basic cable channel WGN America tonight. It's the first major scripted drama taking the Underground Railroad as a setting. Enslaved people in the American South journeyed hundreds of miles to freedom, assisted by abolitionists, black and white. Given the drama of the actual history, it's almost hard to believe the Underground Railroad hasn't been a setting for a TV show before. (As it happens, NBC also planned a miniseries, called Freedom Run, last year, but it didn't pan out.)

Co-creators Misha Green and Joe Pokaski met while working as writers for the series Heroes, which ran for four seasons on NBC. It was Green's idea to draw on their shared love of comic books and action movies for a show that in some ways would be more 24 than Roots. They wanted to make it exciting and high-stakes, real and relevant.

i toggle caption Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television

Underground is, in the manner of Game of Thrones, a multilayered drama following different groups. Here: slave catchers, abolitionists, a plantation family in Georgia, the enslaved people forced to work there, and those who try to escape. Among them, a housemaid played by actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell. She compares Underground to spy thrillers where characters must rely on cryptic clues to make their way to freedom.

""They could use a star or they could use a song, or they could use code words or glances or markings on a tree,"" she says. The song ""Follow the Drinking Gourd,"" for example, is said to contain coded messages about navigating north by using the Big Dipper.

Other TV shows have dramatized American slavery  but not many. And such shows tend to be miniseries, not regularly scheduled dramas that could air for years. The great Roots, from 1977, was a miniseries. So was BET's critically acclaimed The Book of Negroes, from 2015. (Roots is scheduled for a remake this year.) The PBS series Mercy Street, which debuted this year, is set during the Civil War.

""But slavery is folded within it and not at all its center,"" writes Lisa Woolfork, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies representations of American slavery.

Woolfork says she's heard complaints about ""slavery fatigue"" since the success of high-profile movies such as 12 Years a Slave and Django Unchained. Writers Kara Brown in Jezebel and Demetria Lucas D'Oyley in The Root both recently wrote about it. Woolfork says she wholeheartedly understands wanting to put a shameful past behind us.

""We want to have it safely away so it doesn't impede on our everyday life,"" Woolfork says. ""But one way to understand why our present is the way it is, is rooted in the past. As Faulkner said, 'The past is never dead. It isn't even past.' ""

i toggle caption Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television

I hadn't yet talked to Woolfork when lead actor Aldis Hodge and production designer Meghan Rogers took me to Undeground's reconstructed slave quarters outside the Rural Life Museum at Louisiana State University  another exterior set. Seven wooden shacks were arranged around a vegetable garden, all authentic slave cabins from the 1830s that had been moved from another location.

""This was creepy sometimes,"" Rogers admitted.

""Very creepy,"" Hodge agreed. ""The first time on set, all of us, we didn't know where to step, we didn't know how to act, we didn't want to touch anything. You could feel the presence.""

Hodge says that sense of authenticity helped when he had to play very difficult scenes as the leader of the resistance. On one of the first days of shooting, he said, his character had to beg for his life on his knees after being caught.

""Those are the hard days,"" he said. ""It hurts, and there's no way you can come from set without taking a little piece of that with you.""

Filming Underground wasn't just emotionally draining for the actors. It was physically challenging. When Rogers created the set for the abolitionists' house, she built a secret passageways and a bunker where actors playing runaways had to crouch for hours.

""We play a lot of action of people standing on top of people hiding,"" she said. ""You could see a slave catcher standing right on top of someone.""

The production designer was incredibly attentive to tiny details and nuances. For example, she designed the dresses of the plantation housemaids to nearly fade into the wallpaper of the big house, so the women are almost like furniture. And she made the color yellow a motif  the color of freedom. It's the color of a ribbon carried by a runaway, and the color of the lanterns set in the window of the abolitionists' house as a signal.

""Throughout the entire show. I had somebody putting yellow flowers all over the place when they're on their journey,"" Rogers said. ""It's echoing the color of the lantern, the light of the lantern.""

It's fair to say that nothing in Underground is sepia-toned. The music is contemporary, and so is much of the language. Co-creator Misha Green said she aimed to pull American history off the wall of the proverbial museum.

""The Underground Railroad was the first integrated civil rights movement,"" she said. ""And it's a great example of when we work together, what we can go against. Which is 600 miles of crazy terrain being chased by slave catchers to get people to be what they should be in the first case  which is free.""",[]

To avoid any mistaken impressions about who was in charge, geographic and historic references to prisoner of war camps, concentration camps and death camps must be carefully worded. For instance, during WWII, the Japanese military held prisoners in the Philippines. Do not simply say they were Philippine prisoner of war camps. They were Japanese-run prisoner of war camps in the Philippines. Likewise, Auschwitz was not a Polish death camp. It was a Nazi- (or German) death camp in Poland.

In late 2014, Apple settled a class-action lawsuit over e-book pricing that had been brought by consumers and 33 U.S. states, but the payments in that case were predicated upon the outcome of Apple's appeal of the federal antitrust case. Today's rejection by the Supreme Court triggers Apple's payment of some $400 million to people who bought e-books.

""Most e-book purchasers will receive reimbursement for the higher prices Apple's conduct caused them to pay through automatic credits at their e-book retailers,"" the Justice Department says. ""They will be able to apply these credits to future purchases.""

The case's roots date back at least six years, when Apple sold its first iPad models and sought to compete with books giant Amazon as well as Barnes and Noble (both companies had already released their own e-book devices). Apple also launched an e-book marketplace for the iPad  and it was found to have conspired with five large book publishers to set prices that were higher than Amazon's.

Back in 2013, NPR reported that Apple's CEO Steve Jobs had been found to have sent an email to News Corp. executive James Murdoch, urging the participation of News Corp. property HarperCollins, including this line: ""Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream ebooks market at $12.99 and $14.99.""",[]

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Thank you, Bill.

SAGAL: In just a minute, Bill Kurtis is nominated for a rhyme-time Emmy in our Listener Limerick challenge. If you'd like to play, give us a call 1-888-WAIT-WAIT. That's 1-888-924-8924. Right now panel, some more questions for you from the week's news. Bobcat, please listen to this interesting statement.

BILL KURTIS: Ms. Eisenstein, one question...

SAGAL: OK, it's not that interesting. What is interesting is the person who said it. Who asked his first question in 10 years?

BOBCAT GOLDTHWAIT: First question in 10 years.

SAGAL: Yeah.

ROXANNE ROBERTS: It happened in Washington.

GOLDTHWAIT: Yeah, that's not going to help me.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: For 10 years...

ADAM BURKE: He doesn't even know which Washington you mean.

GOLDTHWAIT: Yeah.

SAGAL: For 10 years, this guy's had a job with until recently eight other people. And they all ask questions. He never asks a question. He finally did it this week.

BURKE: And it's not anyone on ""The Voice.""

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: Is it a Supreme Court justice?

SAGAL: It is.

GOLDTHWAIT: Yeah, that's - I'm out.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: That's all you got? No, wait a minute. You don't know their names. It's not a question of...

GOLDTHWAIT: Yeah, yeah.

SAGAL: ...Remembering. You just don't know.

GOLDTHWAIT: You are startled by not my stupidity but my honesty.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Yeah, no, I think it's actually admirable.

GOLDTHWAIT: It's refreshing, yeah.

BURKE: Wait, did you just quote Donald Trump?

SAGAL: All right.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: So I'm going to have to - I'm going to have to throw it open. And I know both of you know.

BURKE: Yeah.

ROBERTS: Clarence Thomas.

SAGAL: Clarence Thomas.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: Clarence Thomas.

GOLDTHWAIT: Oh, I know him.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: No, you don't. Ten years almost to the day after he last asked a question in court, Justice Thomas spoke. And observers were amazed that the first thing to come out of his mouth wasn't, say, a cocktail frank he'd been choking on since 2006.

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: It sounds like a new hearing-aid battery.

SAGAL: You think?

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: He just didn't know what they were doing all this time.

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: It was so weird. Today at work was so weird. These guys came in...

GOLDTHWAIT: They were all talking and yammering.

SAGAL: I don't want to say anything because I'm embarrassed I can't hear. Here, I'll just sign this order banning abortion - fine.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Roxanne, this week, there was a milestone in the development of driverless car technology. For the first time, a driverless car did what?

ROBERTS: It got into a fender-bender.

SAGAL: It did.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: It caused an accident...

ROBERTS: Yes.

SAGAL: ...Which has never happened before. Driverless cars have been in accidents before, but it's never been their fault. The blame was always on driver-full car. In this incident, a Google car changed lanes suddenly, went right into a bus. Then, as its programming dictated, it pretended to have whiplash.

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: It was going 2 miles an hour. How could they even tell?

BURKE: Even more impressive, that car blew a 2.1 blood-alcohol content.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Yes.

GOLDTHWAIT: But there's been other driverless cars. They just didn't have computers in them.

SAGAL: That's true.

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: I grew up with many driverless cars.

SAGAL: Sure.

GOLDTHWAIT: We - our driveway was on a slant.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: You were a technological genius before your time.

BURKE: Yeah.

GOLDTHWAIT: I'm telling you just - you know, after a couple of pops, my dad didn't always put it in park.

SAGAL: Safe, yeah.

GOLDTHWAIT: We invented the driverless car.

Bernie Sanders was the story of Tuesday night as he beat Hillary Clinton in Michigan's Democratic presidential primary. It wasn't a walloping  he won by less than 2 points  but still a big coup considering Clinton led in most polls by double digits before the race.

Michigan is Sanders' ninth state win, though Clinton still leads in delegates overall.

That means Sanders is only partway up a steep hill to the nomination.

""I am used to climbing steep hills,"" Sanders told NPR's Ari Shapiro, host of All Things Considered, noting that when he began his campaign he was unknown to most Americans. ""Stay tuned. I think we are going to go further and we have a good chance to pull off the biggest political upset in the modern history of America. We can win this thing.""

As far as the delegate count so far goes, he admits, ""We have not done well in the deep South,"" but adds that ""it's not surprising. The South is a pretty conservative area, I'm not a conservative.""

But he points out the wins he has had in New England, the Midwest and West. Given those, he said, he thinks he has a ""pretty good chance"" to win in New York and an ""excellent chance"" in California, Oregon, Hawaii and smaller states like Montana and Idaho.

However, an NPR analysis found that even if on Tuesday, Sanders wins 55 percent of the delegates in Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, but Clinton wins 60 percent in North Carolina, Sanders would slip further behind, needing 54 percent of all remaining delegates.

After next week, even if Sanders wins four large, non-Southern contests (Wisconsin, Oregon, Washington and California) with 60 percent, he would still need to pick up 51 percent of the delegates from all remaining contests to win a majority of pledged delegates.

And there's another challenge ahead of him. He won Michigan largely thanks to white voters, but has struggled to appeal to African-Americans. He won a larger share of black votes in Michigan than he had been winning, but still not a majority  just around 30 percent.

The real hurdle, he says, is getting his message out to black voters  in a way that Hillary Clinton hasn't already.

""I don't think it's a question of us winning over black voters, I think it is a question of Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton having very strong support in the African-American community,"" he said. ""I congratulate them.""

Sanders also responded to his comment in the last debate that drew ire from some black leaders (""When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto""), emphasizing his track record on poverty.

""There's no candidate who has talked more about poverty in this country than I have. White poverty, black poverty and Latino poverty,"" he said. ""Now it would be nice if every once in a while the media paid attention to those issues, which we don't.""",[]

But, being a pioneer story, it isn't a smooth journey. In Minnesota, the family is held up by mud from rains, and it takes the opportunity to trade its tired horses for a pair of mustangs. In Kansas, those same mustangs struggle to swim the family's covered wagon across a deep creek, and Pa has to dive in to guide them to the other side. More adventures await after the Ingalls settle on the Plains  from building a house to meeting the neighbors to fighting off fevers and dealing with Indians.

I remember that reading this book as a kid, I was struck by how tough 19th century life was. But now I'm more impressed by the story's grown-ups.

We wrote about this last month. The New York Times public editor weighed in this week. Its worth repeating:

When politicians and public officials (or anyone, for that matter) say things that dont fit the facts, we should point it out  and we are, as the Break It Down fact-checks show.

Our earlier post suggested several ways to say and write that what Candidate A or City Official B just said doesnt stand up to scrutiny. The Times Margaret Sullivan pointed to other approaches, such as noting that they spoke without citing any evidence or that the statement has no basis in fact.

If the evidence shows that a claim clearly doesnt add up, we dont need to qualify with a critics contend or a some say. State what is known and how weve reached that conclusion (for example, an NPR search of news accounts and police records found no evidence to support the claim).

Sullivan also noted something we agree with: that as much as possible, the fact-checking should be done in real time. That is, as soon as possible after a claim is made. Weve been doing that very effectively after the presidential debates and notable claims by candidates.

Obviously, politicians and public officials arent the only people who make claims that cant be substantiated. Keep in mind that, as the Ethics Handbook says, our purpose is to pursue the truth. Diligent verification is critical. We take great care to ensure that statements of fact in our journalism are both correct and in context. Also, we shouldnt just spread information.

Late Thursday evening, Kendrick Lamar crept back into our lives like a thief in the night. With his new album untitled unmastered., Lamar and his label Top Dawg Entertainment offer us a look at the steps it took to get to his fully formed magnum opus  2015's To Pimp A Butterfly  and show us that they can stop the world when they feel like it.

Officially deemed a collection of ""demos,"" the raw tracks are nameless and featureless, identified only by the date they were presumably recorded. Up until now, Lamar had only given a few hints that this music existed. He performed one song on The Tonight Show just this January, part of another on the Grammys even more recently, and another on the Colbert Report in 2014. ""Untitled 03,"" the song from his Colbert appearance, was recorded more than a year and a half before he performed it. We're listening to Lamar's past in the present here. It feels like we're playing catch-up.

The project shows us demos within demos, with parts of one song appearing on another song  sometimes recorded years apart. One of the more forward-thinking tracks is called ""Untitled 07"": It feels and sounds like Lamar is shaking off flakes of the old him and growing a new skin by the minute. In that song and others, we get a direct line into Kendrick Lamar's experimentation with using his voice as an instrument. We hear him strain and yell and whisper his way through his own evolution.

untitled. unmastered. is both the fire and ashes from which To Pimp A Butterfly rose. As I listen, the only thought running through my mind is: What does the material Kendrick Lamar recorded yesterday sound like? And when will we be ready for it?",[]

i ImageZoo/Corbis ImageZoo/Corbis

When she was 17, Tracey Helton Mitchell was prescribed an opioid pain killer after getting her wisdom teeth extracted. The medicine helped her deal with the pain related to the extraction, but when the prescription ran out, her desire for its euphoric high remained. That's when she turned to heroin.

As a teenager, Mitchell imagined heroin to be glamorous, but she found it wasn't once she became an addict. She tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that the drug ruined her health and her self-esteem. She lived in an alley, shot drugs into the bottom of her feet, sold her body for money and was jailed several times. She was also featured in a 1999 documentary about addicts called Black Tar Heroin.

At one of her lowest points, Mitchell says, ""I was having heart palpitations, because I was using stimulants, and I thought, 'They're going to pull me out of this hotel, I have no ID, my parents, my family ... will never know that I died and I'll just be a Jane Doe and this is how I'm going to expire in this place.' ""

But Mitchell didn't die from her addiction. Rather, with the help of the nondenominational 12-step program LifeRing and other support groups and therapies, she eventually stopped using and became a certified addiction specialist. She has been clean for 18 years.

In her new memoir, The Big Fix, Mitchell writes about her addiction and her path to recovery, and also shares insights into today's heroin epidemic. When it comes to our current treatment system, Mitchell says we would do better to reach out to addicts as individuals, by recognizing each user's unique needs and motivations.

Our current method of treatment is ""sort of a one-size-[fits]-all approach,"" she says. ""We need to have a variety of different kinds of treatment interventions that address people's needs.""

Interview Highlights

On what it's like to watch Black Tar Heroin now that she's clean

It can be painful to watch, especially when I think about my life now and I contrast that. ... My legs did look like I was dropped in a dumpster and picked out by rats. I had, I think, 34 or 36 abscesses. I have scars that have healed, but I had to have surgeries on some and in the summertime when everybody else is wearing shorts and stuff like that, I see those things  even right now sitting here at the table I can see one of the scars on my arms. It's a good thing in that it reminds me of where I was, but then it's also very challenging, because this documents a very unpleasant part of my life that can't be changed.

On why she agreed to be filmed

I really believed that I was going to die, or be murdered. There was lots of evidence to make me feel that way, and I wanted it to be something that people would see after I was dead that showed that heroin was not the glamorous thing that I had thought it was when I was a teenager and had imagined it. I wasn't paid for the film; it was a huge inconvenience in my life, but I feel like it still is sort of my legacy to the world, because it's something that's watched today. Millions of people still watch it.

On black tar heroin in the '90s versus heroin today

There's still tar heroin. The heroin that most people get today is much, much stronger. We didn't have to worry about fentanyl  of us dropping dead from an overdose, because no one cut it with fentanyl. The thing that we really worried about was getting flesh-eating [bacteria, necrotizing fasciitis] ... or getting some kind of wound botulism or getting abscesses. There certainly were overdoses then. You could get arrested for overdosing and a lot of people were rolled out at the hospitals or left outside to die ... but there wasn't this culture of heroin where heroin is prevalent absolutely everywhere. It was more localized to big cities, more urban areas.

On 'hitting bottom'

i toggle caption Michael Kerner Photography/Seal Press Michael Kerner Photography/Seal Press

I don't believe in the concept of a bottom. I think that if the opposite of addiction is connection, that addicts or people who use drugs are really seeking out  they need some kind of connection with people. And I would say I've had a wide variety of bottoms, but I wasn't ready to stop until I started to believe that there was a possibility that I actually could stop and saw reasons for myself to stop, and my motivation is totally different.

On being ready to get clean

One of the myths about addiction is that you come to this incredible moment of clarity and that you decide that you're going to stop. And so over the course of my using I had various moments of clarity and I had various points where I had wanted to stop, but they were not always congruent with my opportunities.

So there [were] very few opportunities where I really could truly try to stop, but I would stop using for a few days, I'd try to kick on my own, I'd switch to different drugs, I'd move to different places. I tried different things to stop, but I wasn't completely ready, because all these different traumas had accumulated in my life, and I wasn't prepared to deal with the emotional consequences of all these different things. And that's what to me being off drugs meant  was that I would have to then figure out how I was going to fix all these things on my own. And it wasn't until I got an idea that maybe other people would help me, talking to my mother, knowing that I would have some kind of emotional support where I'd start seeing [that] maybe I don't have to totally do all of this on my own.

On needle exchange programs

At the time there was no needle exchange at all [in Cincinnati] and so you would use the same syringe over and over again and hopefully it didn't break off in your arm. Until the numbers wore off of it, you would sharpen it on a matchbook, and it was just horrible; it was like a rusty nail sticking in your arm.

So I came to San Francisco and they had needle exchanges, which was a revelation, because so many people in the country were suffering from HIV and AIDS, particularly AIDS, because there was no anti-retrovirals. ... So the syringe exchange people provided me education about my drug use. ...

I've seen in my life so many examples of where not having a clean syringe never stopped anyone. I've seen people pick them up out of the gutters. Even here in San Francisco, where there's a lot of access, people break open sharps containers that they've stolen from hospitals because they needed a syringe and they don't have one. ... It doesn't stop people. All it does is spread a public health crisis.

On harm reduction and the argument that harm reduction enables users

My answer is, you can't get clean if you're dead, so there has to be harm reduction. We're not encouraging people to do anything, we're taking a look at their public health behaviors and then addressing what the particular needs are, so look at the cost of one syringe versus the cost of someone getting hepatitis C and having to take care of them for a lifetime.

Look at the public health cost of various other medical conditions that a person can have. From not using sterile water or alcohol pads, someone having endocarditis or some other infection, so having a safe system for people to take care of themselves and treating addicts, users not just addicts, there's plenty of people who use who are not necessarily considered on the spectrum of drug addicts, treating people humanely and having them have access to public health services and the things that they need.

On coping with depression since becoming clean

Part of the reason why I wanted to write The Big Fix is because I felt like there's no ... real education on long-term recovery about what really happens over time. So dealing with topics like untreated depression and anxiety and all the other kind of things that you go through when you take the drugs away, and then you have new issues, because before you use drugs, you didn't have all these guilty, shameful things that you ... now have to deal with, if you're a person like me and you get off drugs.

So I've had a very complicated relationship with my emotions in the past 18 years that I've been clean. I've dealt with very serious post-traumatic stress disorder, being very checked out and dissociative at various points, having to deal with the constant specter of depression, every once in a while having suicidal thoughts. And one of the things that I try to do is really normalize those feelings when people want to know what recovery is really like. It's like, some days you really feel crappy. You really have some things that are going on with you, and I think the prevalent idea is that you get clean and everything is supposed to be great. ... You can have a great life and still not feel all that great.",[]

Crusty editors arent the only ones who extol the merits of precision writing and editing.

Heres what comedian Hasan Minaj had to say about Jon Stewart during Elizabeth Blairs piece on Morning Edition today:

Hes always been really great about cutting. ... Because we only have 22 minutes to convey a lot and in a field piece you only have 4 1/2, 5 minutes, maybe 6 minutes tops. ... Cutting out extraneous stuff, even if its extra laughs. ... Cutting those things out to convey the story and to convey the narrative and the argument. And youll still get great jokes in there. But once you really establish and lay that groundwork out, thats where it goes to that next level.

i Katherine Du/NPR Katherine Du/NPR

Serekalem Alemu is crocheting a basket.

Wearing a grey fleece jacket and a long grey skirt speckled with blue flowers, Alemu sits on a sofa on the second floor of a former warehouse in the industrial section of Tel Aviv. A damp Mediterranean winter breeze blows in through the open window. Traffic whizzes by on the boulevard below. With her thick black hair held back in a ponytail, the 28-year-old winds long, narrow strips of teal-colored fabric into a ball, which will eventually become a basket.

When she's finished  it takes her about three hours to make a basket about 10 inches in diameter  her handiwork will go on sale for $25 in a boutique. She'll keep half of that and the rest goes to keep the program going.

But for Alemu, the basket isn't just about earning some money. It's therapy. It makes her feel better. And she has a lot of reasons to feel bad.

Alemu is one of 43,000 African asylum-seekers, mainly from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan, who traveled by foot and vehicle many hundreds of miles to reach Israel. They're part of the largest global wave of asylum seekers since World War II.

Many of these migrants suffer along the way. Alemu says she was tortured by her smugglers but will not elaborate. When she reached Israel in 2011, she fell into depression and was hospitalized twice in a psychiatric ward.

Other migrant women have reported rape and human trafficking, saying they are passed from one group of smugglers to another, who torture them until they pay large sums of money for their freedom. They often ask family members or friends abroad to send the money. Humanitarian aid groups estimate that some 4,000 to 6,000 of the Africans who've made it to Israel have been victimized.

But when they were offered the chance to talk with a therapist in Israel, it didn't work.

""I soon realized that wasn't an appropriate approach,"" says psychologist Diddy Mymin Kahn, who has worked as a therapist for the Tel Aviv African Refugee Development Center.

Women often didn't show up for their appointments. Those who did would not share their stories, says Kahn.

So she teamed up with an art therapist to found the Kuchinate African Women's Collective, funded by grants and donations from organizations and individuals. Sister Azezet Kidane, a Roman Catholic nun from Eritrea and a registered nurse, soon joined to help develop the program.

Kuchinate means ""crochet"" in Tigrigna, an Eritrean language, and that's what the participants do. There are 40 members of the collectives. Twice a week, many of these female asylum seekers come to the refurbished Tel Aviv warehouse to crochet baskets, using long strips of colorful polyester fabric. Back home, they used to weave baskets from the flexible fronds of the doum species of palm tree, but the tree is rare in Israel.

There's something about the experience of crocheting that encourages them to open up.

As they make the baskets, they talk about dealing with the stress and trauma of their migration as well as the uncertainty of life in Israel. Most of them currently live without any official status or rights until a government policy is established for the asylum seekers.

""Many of them are traumatized when they come here, but this group gives them strength to bring it out, to talk about it,"" says Kidane. ""It's a process of healing.""

She and Kahn sit and talk to the women while they crochet, sometimes steering conversation to topics like how to handle stress or traumatic memories. When one participant shares her difficulties or feelings, others speak up, either telling the group or going into a side room to speak privately with Kidane and Kahn.

""Our people, they don't do counseling one-on-one, you need a group, a circle,"" Kidane said. ""Many of the asylum-seekers were raped, and they often keep it secret because they think it's only them and they are ashamed. But here they meet other people with the same experiences and feel, oh, I am not alone.""

""It's a major crisis,"" said Kim Yuval, coordinator of psychotherapy at Physicians for Human Rights, who has also studied the prevalence of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder among asylum seekers as part of his doctoral research at the University of Haifa. ""Many people are resilient, but as a community the situation is very bad, and it's important that we deal with these problems."" In one study involving 116 Sudanese asylum-seekers in Tel Aviv, Yuval found that 60 percent suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, and roughly a quarter suffer from depression.

These problems are not isolated to those from Sudan or those in Israel, Yuval said, but are seen among asylum-seekers globally.

""When I am at home I cry all day,"" said 31-year-old Lula Gebrekidan, who left Eritrea five years ago hoping to eventually pave the way for her three daughters and husband, who is currently jailed for political opposition to the regime there. ""When I am here, I don't cry. I talk to others.""

Her eyes swell with tears as she describes scenes she witnessed in the two weeks she spent in the Sinai, where she paid a smuggler $3,000 to drive her to the Israeli border.

""I saw rape, a woman who had sex with six men all right after each other. I also saw a 5-year-old boy buried in the dirt up to his neck, with men throwing rocks at his head until his family would pay more money to their smugglers,"" Gebrekidan said. ""Talking about it brings some relief.""

She said she was only able to talk about her experiences after hearing similar stories from others. ""At home it is forbidden to discuss things like this,"" Gebrekidan said.

Kahn and Kidane say that many of the women here need help beyond this program, but this is a start to pulling them out of depression and assessing their needs.

""They see, ah, I am still alive, I am still capable,"" Kidane said. ""For them it is a door opening.""

The room is lined with floor-to-ceiling shelves, full of hundreds of baskets made by these women. In the corner of the studio, Gebrekidan roasts cardamom-scented coffee beans over hot coals in a metal box. The studio's kitchenette is equipped with electric burners, but she prefers to make coffee in this traditional way, the aromatic steam and smoke from the smoldering coals floating out the nearby open window. She is preparing the coffee for a group of Israeli mothers from a suburban Tel Aviv school who will soon arrive for a crochet workshop taught by the women of the collective.

For a couple of hours the asylum-seekers teach the Israelis how to crochet, then serve them Gebrekidan's coffee along with injera, a flat sourdough bread common in Eritrea and Ethiopia, and dips made of lentils and chickpeas. The mothers leave, most of them with baskets they purchased. The African women again gather in a circle of chairs and continue making more baskets and talking.

For Alemu, the two days a week when she comes here are critical.

""I still have a problem in my head,"" she said. ""But my head is better here.""",[]

One of the long-standing tenets of rap bravado is truth-telling. For an MC to be deemed ""real,"" the stories he pens must be more than mere stories; they must be rooted in fact. Rap has often viewed verses as a house of mirrors, always reflecting one's reality even if, at times, the image is distorted. Saint Paul, Minnesota's Allan Kingdom isn't one for convention; he's a nonconformist and a stylist with malleable, half-sung flows, but he too subscribes to this particular principle. As a decidedly Bohemian, free-thinker type, his message is often clear: Be yourself and be honest about it.

toggle caption courtesy of the artist

His recent mixtape, Northern Lights, explores this sentiment in many hues, seemingly taking sonic cues from the cosmos. Yet its anchor, ""Fables"", is an ominous, prowling tune less concerned with the Aesop variety, than with the complete obfuscation of truth. Over heavy, plodding electric piano keys and swirling, disembodied vocals that pass through the track like apparitions, Kingdom delivers straight talk about being true to oneself.He creeps through some cadences and stretches others, using one of the oldest parables to help paint his picture: ""Cain and Abel since the cradle/ Couldn't hate or hurt my bro/ In a maze with all your tales/ I don't know which way to go."" The voices wisp in and out as the air grows still around him.

The turning point in ""Fables"" is the spellbinding third verse, performed dutifully by reggae singer Chronixx with a resonant tone that's almost built for carving out echoes in this cavernous setting. His presence is more fleshed out than Kingdom's, and the contrast adds depth and perspective, providing small insights into being forthcoming: ""Call a spade a spade and throw your cards on the table,"" he sings, swelling into a crescendo. But it is still the shape-shifting Kingdom who drives the point home with his own self-awareness: ""Don't tell no fables, now I'm able/ I know, can't hit every note/ Yeah I know, but hit that feeling that be deep up in your soul."" He seems to understand what many don't: the realness that makes the greatest impact is the absolute kind, a willingness to bare one's most intimate self, even when the effect is raw and not necessarily positive.

For many writers, the migrant's journey is a storytellers' dream. The transition from one part of the world to another is filled with anticipation, conflict and inherent literary drama. While trains and planes become the mundane means of transportation for most travelers, those trips can herald life-changing transformations for a migrant remaking his or her life through that journey.

Novelist Amitav Ghosh is finishing an epic trilogy of novels  Sea of Poppies, River of Smoke, Flood of Fire  set at sea in the midst of the Opium Wars of the 19th century. They're filled with countless characters from around the world navigating the stormy seas in search of better lives.

The novels examine questions of empire, power and class, but the real star of Ghosh's books is an old-fashioned sailing ship named the Ibis. The former slave ship begins its journey in Baltimore and sails around Africa, onto India and China after it's bought by a British merchant living in Calcutta. As the Ibis docks in ports around the world, a global cast of characters assembles on board  which allows Ghosh to craft a kaleidoscopic portrait of characters.

""The journeys of the people who've come there are themselves so interesting,"" Ghosh says. ""What brings people into this very enclosed space  people with such different histories and experiences  all of that creates endless possibilities."" Beyond the literary possibilities, Ghosh says that convergence of identities echoes the way modern migration has brought so many people together.

""Every ship was in a sense a microcosm of the world,"" says Ghosh, who was inspired by Herman Melville's Moby Dick. ""This is one of Melville's great themes ... how completely different kinds of people are thrust together and how very often their roles just completely change.""

Change is also at the heart of Yann Martel's best-selling novel Life of Pi and its Oscar-winning film adaptation. An Indian boy sailing to Canada with his family survives a shipwreck. He's lost at sea on a lifeboat with a tiger. They must learn to coexist, and they forge a community of survivors.

""The notion of shipwreck in the Life of Pi I think is a perfect metaphor for the experience of exile,"" says Reza Aslan, a best-selling author and editor of the anthology Tablet and Pen. ""Being adrift, looking for a land to call home, that's an experience that I myself have experienced as an exile from Iran,"" he says.

Aslan says Life of Pi shows how the immigrant's journey leaves an individual unmoored  how it throws an identity into flux.

The idea of how immigrants reconcile their past with the future inspired Jhumpa Lahiri's novel The Namesake, which also became a film. In it, a father survives a traumatic train accident as a young man in India.

""We have to go through that darkness, through that chaos and confusion, in order to ... ultimately figure out that the person we are today still has fragments of the person we were before we immigrated,"" says Ilan Stavans, professor of literature at Amherst College and editor of the anthology Becoming Americans. ""What immigrant writers have done in American literature is shown us that America is a microcosm of the world  that all cultures converge here  that we have connections, tentacles to the rest of the world, and that we are a society in constant movement.""

That movement is very much in the headlines today, and it was the subject of Sonia Nazario's Pulitzer Prize-winning Enrique's Journey. Nazario followed a young boy from Honduras searching for his mother in the United States.

""He travels the only way that he can  with little or no money  which is gripping onto the tops and the sides of these freight trains that travel up the length of Mexico. It's a modern-day odyssey that these children go on.""

It's a book of reporting written with a novelist's eye. ""There were gangsters that controlled the train tops,"" Nazario says. ""I would see these guys  they would roam from car to car and surround a group of migrants and say, 'Your money, or your life'  and strip you of your clothes, look for any coins they can find, and sometimes hurdle you down to the churning wheels below.""

Reza Aslan says part of what's fueling the stories of migration are a new generation of writers with roots in multiple parts of the world. ""When you have these writers who have these hyphenated identities,"" he says, ""they have the ability ... to draw from those cultures and to really get at the heart of what literature is about  how we as human beings navigate an indeterminate world; how we understand our place in this planet.""

And ultimately these stories of migration aren't really about the external journey. ""It doesn't matter the mode of transportation  whether by foot or by camel or by car or by plane,"" says Aslan. ""It doesn't matter the destination, and even the journey itself is secondary to the transformation that occurs in the individual making the journey.""

And even for the individual sitting still, reading about those journeys can become its own means of transformation.",[]

When James Corden took over The Late Late Show one year ago, the question on everyone's mind was, ""James who?""

He was big in the U.K. In the U.S. he had starred in the movie Into the Woods and won a Tony for the play One Man, Two Guvnors on Broadway. But beyond that, he was relatively unknown.

So it's kind of unreal that after just one year in the chair, his show has broken records for people watching on YouTube.

That's mostly thanks to a segment called ""Carpool Karaoke."" Corden drives along with celebrities, just the two of them  in a car with a few mounted cameras  singing along to the stereo.

The Late Late Show with James Corden YouTube

The video he made with Adele has been viewed more than 80 million times. He has also done Carpool Karaoke with about a dozen other pop stars, including Justin Bieber and Elton John. The Wall Street Journal called it one of the most successful YouTube franchises of all time.

My producer and I met Corden at his office on the CBS lot in LA where he films The Late Late Show. ""All right, let's light a candle, shall we?"" said Corden. ""Three open-minded, broad-minded guys kicking back with a candle, right?"" The candle has a masculine scent, like leather-bound books. Corden's T-shirt exposes his new temporary tattoo: Cookie Monster, courtesy of his young son.

Corden told me the idea for Carpool Karaoke came out of a segment he filmed with George Michael for a charity back in the U.K., but he couldn't get anybody in the U.S. to sing along.

Finally, he tried Mariah Carey. ""It was a chance meeting with a lady at Mariah Carey's record company, who was here in our office, actually,"" he said. ""And I pulled her in here, to this very office that we're sitting in now, and I played her the clip of George Michael singing, and I was like, it's joyful. And that's what people want, you want to see the joy in people, and you want to see the person that always dreamt of being a star, you know? You want to see people having a great time. So Mariah Carey is a huge fan of George Michael, she said 'if George will do it, I'll do it, let's do it on Sunday!' ""

On the reaction to the first Carpool Karaoke

The second person we did it with was Jennifer Hudson, and that went through the roof. And then there's just been a couple of moments where  we did the one with Justin Bieber, which kind of went crazy, and I think is at 65 million views on YouTube right now. Both Justin and his manager were like, ""that's me. That's the real me in that car, that's me who you're seeing on TV.""

The Late Late Show with James Corden YouTube

On whether Carpool Karaoke serves as a kind of image rehab for some stars

Sometimes you can have a reputation for not being relatable and nice because you had a bad day once. That's the thing. And I think that's particularly pertinent with Justin, because you just forget how young he is. When he gets in a car with me and I feel that about him  and I don't ever want to make a show which is snarky or trying to do someone over, or trying to make it about me, somehow. All I want is our guests to shine, because if our guests shine, our show shines, and if our show shines, then I shine. I don't ever want to come out and make anything about me ... and the whole thing is a collaboration, those carpools.

On whether he dreamed, as a child, of being a pop or theater star

Of course! To be honest, all I wanted to do, all I ever, ever wanted to do, I just wanted to perform. I just wanted to perform in whatever capacity, whether it was acting, singing, dancing, comedy  whatever it was, I just loved it and felt at my absolute happiest when I was performing for people. And if that's what you want from a job, then this is the best job you could ever do.",[]

i toggle caption Theo Wargo/Getty Images Theo Wargo/Getty Images

On Friday night, I finally got to see Hamilton, the critically acclaimed musical I've been surprisingly obsessed with since Frannie Kelley's glowing write-up of the cast album last fall.

I say ""surprising"" because I am not a fan of musical theater, the kind of not-a-fan-of-musical-theater who pointedly self-describes as such should musical theater come up in conversation. But there I was, gripping my seat, as Leslie Odom Jr., the virtuoso who plays Aaron Burr, stood onstage by his lonesome in ""Wait For It,"" my favorite song in a show lousy with fantastic songs.

That number, all about frustrations and ambition and jealousy and doubt, knocked me on my ass the first time I heard it on the album,  like, wtf, do I actually like musicals now?  and the live experience was equally overwhelming. I'd read somewhere that Odom and other cast members regularly focus their attentions on particular audience members while performing, and I'm 95 percent sure that Odom was looking dead at me in the sixth row, as I mouthed along all the words to his song. Just two Philly dudes separated by a few dozen feet and a gaping chasm of musical ability sharing this moment of real connection.

I told my colleague/friend Stephen Thompson, who was with me that night, about this during intermission, and he joked that it was probably because Odom and I seemed to be the only black guys in the theater that night. We laughed, but it was hard not to notice that while Hamilton has been hailed for deliberately casting actors of color as some of America's most venerated Dead White Men, and ""reclaiming the American story ... for the people whom history habitually forgets,"" the actors onstage seemed to make up the majority of brown people in the house the night I went.

This is of course an unscientific study, based on me craning my neck and looking around the room, but three other folks who've seen the show recently tell me the audience was overwhelmingly white when they went, too. Yesterday, I asked folks on Twitter who've seen the show to share their experience, and many of them told me the same thing.

I'm avoiding making a too-obvious ""Great White Way"" joke here, but it seems these observations track with Broadway audiences in general; according to The Broadway League, the trade association for the Broadway theater industry, nearly 8 in 10 people who saw Broadway shows in 2014-2015 were white and in their mid-40s. (That's more diverse and a decade younger than NPR's audience, for the record.) About 80 percent had college degrees and about 40 percent had graduate degrees.

Now, I'm not arguing that black and brown folks ""should"" go to Broadway shows, and there is, of course, lots of theater, far from Broadway, that caters to audiences of color. But it's worth asking why this ostensibly uber-POC-friendly phenomenon isn't consistently pulling a notably black and brown audience.

A bunch of folks in the Twitter conversation yesterday suggested that who goes to Broadway shows is a simple matter of dollars and cents. James McMaster at HowlRound recently made a similar assertion about Hamilton, which you pretty much can't see without parting with a couple of hundred bucks:

The exorbitantly high ticket prices coupled with the perpetually sold-out status of the production prohibit most working class people of color from attending the show. Given that the production's audience, then, is overwhelmingly white and upper-middle-class, one wonders about the reception of the show's racial performance. How many one-percenters walk away from Hamilton thinking that they are on the right side of history simply because they exchanged hundreds of dollars for the opportunity to sit through a racialized song and dance? My guess: too many.

This is a compelling argument, but then again, nearly half a million folks book flights and hotels and tickets for EssenceFest in New Orleans each year. Then there's the mad rush a few weeks back for tickets for Beyonce's surprise tour. That is to say, there's a whole lot of pricey entertainment that people of color are willing to drop serious dough on, but Broadway shows like Hamilton don't seem to rate. Money matters, of course, but it's not the whole story.

When it comes to race and Broadway audiences, a big part of the story seems to be acculturation. Theater has a long history of segregated seating and plays chock full of racist caricatures that meant black folks, in particular, never warmed to Broadway. ""Theatergoing on Broadway is supported by families who collected programs going back 50 or 80 years,"" James Hatch, the co-author of A History of African American Theatre, told WNYC in 2012. ""Blacks did not have that tradition, and apparently still don't.""

That plays out today in the important, subtle social cues about who belongs. It's hard enough getting comfortable in a social space when you're unfamiliar with its rules and conventions. It's even harder when you're aware of how much you stand out. At Broadway shows like Hamilton, you get the honor of having that experience for a few hundred dollars. Even as Hamilton exceeded my impossibly high expectations, I felt a vague unease sitting there that night, like I was at a hip-hop show where my favorite group was performing, but I might get shushed for rapping along too loudly. (But c'mon, y'all: HERCULES MULLIGAN!)

Not being a regular theatergoer or a Broadway vet meant I didn't know exactly how to be in the audience. I was unfamiliar enough with the ritual and customs of that space to be worried that I might be doing it wrong somehow. Could that disconnect be keeping folks who might shell out comparable cash for Bey, even if it means traveling to another city, from doing the same for Hamilton? Something I've been chewing on, and sound off on Twitter if you think I'm wildly off-base here.",[]

 The conversations start from this position: We report the news, good and bad.

 But we cant be callous. The video may show someones death. Out of respect for that person and that persons family, we consider carefully what should be shown or heard. Our general rule is that we do not post video or play audio of someones moment of death. There will be exceptions, but only after discussion.

 We also respect our audience. They want the facts. But for many, reading or hearing descriptions will be more than enough. Seeing or hearing disturbing events could leave them too shaken to follow the rest of a story.

 Every other news outlet else is using it is not on its own a justification for posting or broadcasting anything.

 Especially in the first minutes and hours after such content surfaces, its credibility may be in doubt. Proceed with caution.

 The content may be propaganda. For example, extremist groups spread their messages and try to spread terror by putting out videos of hostages being murdered. We do not blindly post or air propaganda. It would be highly unusual for us to even link to it.

Rigid rules about what to do wont work. Each situation is different. However:

 If its decided that videos with potentially disturbing content can be posted, they should never start automatically when a webpage loads. They must require a click to begin. They must either have a warning note embedded in them or it must appear directly above them.

 Likewise, on the air listeners should never hear potentially disturbing content without first being told that its coming. For instance, cellphone audio of gunshots that kill a man should not be heard until after a caution has been given.

 We should consider whether a videos disturbing moments and sounds can and should be blurred and bleeped, for posting online and using on the air.

 If the original content is too disturbing to post and we do not have a blurred/bleeped version that we are comfortable using, we may decide to link to another news outlets edited version if it is in line with our standards. We should caution readers that it includes potentially disturbing content. The language should be simple and clear. For example: The Daily Planet has posted a clip from the video here. Reminder: It is graphic.

 When a member station is chasing the same story, we should talk with the news director about how to handle the content. Often, well be in agreement and can link to the stations coverage.

But, But, But:

 Does this mean well never put such content online or on the air?

No. See above: We report the news, good and bad. We would not have edited a video of the Challenger explosion, for example, to blur the key moments.

 Are we treating the audience like children?

Some will say we are. We believe were making editorial judgments.

Note: The guidance above applies to images as well. We do not post potentially disturbing photos without first discussing.

i toggle caption Andi Harman/Courtesy of the artist Andi Harman/Courtesy of the artist

As one of the two guitarists and principal songwriters in the Denton, Texas, bands The Marked Men and Radioactivity, Mark Ryan indulges his gifts for heart-on-the-sleeve melodic punk and power-pop, respectively. But his band Mind Spiders seems to act as the warehouse in which Ryan stores his other obsessions: vaguely sci-fi-influenced, tightly wound, good-time rock 'n' roll, set off by dual drummers and the occasional synth. Mind Spiders' three albums prior to Prosthesis did little to deviate from this path, but technology has caught up with Ryan and his cohorts: Daniel Fried, Gregory Rutherford and Marked Men bandmate Mike Throneberry.

Prosthesis is Mind Spiders' darkest release yet, both in themes and atmosphere, and electronics feature more prominently in its eight songs than ever before. ""Cold,"" ""Ulcer"" and ""No Filter"" hit a particularly doomed note, but the synths and drum machine provide a presence rather than drive the proceedings; if anything, Mind Spiders uses them as pace-setting devices for the guitars and live drummer to outrun, in sprints of strident downpicking and on-the-beat hi-hat/snare work. Even ""Split In Two""  in which the digital tones create jarring tone clashes that bear a resemblance to Devo  also reflects the group's insistence on precision, a foil for the band to continue attacking the beat.

As for its dystopian concept, that's for Mind Spiders to explain, but it's telling that the group's most engaged record to date is also its most brooding. Prosthesis provides a modern soundtrack to the world inspired by the film Logan's Run, with Ryan and his bandmates seeking an escape and ultimately getting someplace worth going.",[]
npr.org,2016-03-08 00:00:00,'A Man Lies Dreaming' By Lavie Tidhar,[],"Unnerving WWII Noir In 'A Man Lies Dreaming'

Books that imagine a different version of the World War II era are as old as Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle and as new as Philip Roth's 2005 novel The Plot Against America. But few of these alternate histories are as bold and unnerving as Lavie Tidhar's A Man Lies Dreaming. First published in the UK in 2014, the novel is now out in the U.S., and it couldn't appear at a more unnerving time: As if mirroring our current election cycle, it depicts a right-wing politician successfully stoking the fires of xenophobia and bigotry. But in the case of Dreaming, the setting is London in 1939  in a world where the Nazis never rose to power in Germany, and the British Fascist leader Oswald Mosley is leading the race to become the new Prime Minister.

Oswald, however, is not the main character in Dreaming. Tidhar's choice is far more audacious: The book centers around Wolf, a down-and-out private eye in London who escaped Germany in 1933 when the communists  not the National Socialists  took over. It becomes clear very early on that Wolf is, in fact, Adolf Hitler.

Tidhar has handled reviled, real-life figures in his fiction before, most notably in 2011's Osama, and at first Dreaming feels like a reprise. Tidhar has other plans, though. The plot of Dreaming unfolds like a hardboiled detective yarn, with Wolf being hired by a mysterious  and Jewish  femme fatale to find her missing sister. At the same time, he takes on a second case for Oswald, whom he both admires and resents for capitalizing on the same anti-Semitic, nationalistic ideas that Wolf himself once spread. Wolf, at heart, is still the Hitler of our world, with the same virulent beliefs and lust for power: ""Give me a large enough lever and I would move the very world,"" he snarls in frustration, a would-be despot who was never given the chance to twist the world into his own image.

If that kind of alt-history speculation comprised the entirety of Dreaming, it'd be an intriguing read. But it's only the tip of Tidhar's iceberg. In a story that intersects Wolf's, a Jew named Shomer  hailing from our version of reality  is a prisoner at Auschwitz. He's also a writer of pulp detective stories. The interplay between the two storylines grows profound as they progress. Wolf's investigations take bizarre, grotesque, blackly comedic turns while Shomer's horrific existence grows symbolic  and then something magically more than symbolic  when the SS assigns him the task of making doors.

'Dreaming' is a book of big ideas, from the pathological origins of racist ideology to the way humanizing and dehumanizing those we love or loathe are flip sides of the same coin.

Like any good alt-history, Dreaming is exhaustively researched. A multitude of historical figures pop up in its pages, including many literary ones  among them A. A. Milne, J. R. R. Tolkien, Ian Fleming, and Evelyn Waugh. Some feel gratuitous and even distracting; others, like G. K. Chesterton and his notions of law and anarchy from The Man Who Was Thursday, feed into the thematic fabric that Tidhar weaves. Dreaming is a book of big ideas, from the pathological origins of racist ideology to the way humanizing and dehumanizing those we love or loathe are flip sides of the same coin.

Functionally, Hitler is the hero of Dreaming. Tidhar evokes a flesh-crawling sympathy for the most hated man in modern history while degrading him physically, emotionally, and sexually. He also paints a bloodcurdling picture of Auschwitz, where ""men die like smoke"" and ""women die like air."" Holocaust survivor Yehiel De-Nur  author of the infamously lurid House of Dolls  appears briefly as a character in the book, observing that ""this is an alien planet [...]. This is Planet Auschwitz."" A few pages earlier, Wolf is absurdly, hilariously envisioning how he might have brutally subjugated Oz if he'd been its dictator, all while grudgingly admitting to himself how much he loves ""Over the Rainbow.""

Tidhar tightropes between fantasy, farce, and historical fiction, all while grounding things in brisk, gritty noir. Parallels to our current state of affairs abound, but if anything, they're simply symptoms of how the past can recycle itself in frightening new ways  a process that Dreaming compellingly picks apart and rewires. History isn't written by the winners or the losers, Tidhar illustrates, but by those who know how to shroud it and spin it the most entertainingly. Which only makes Dreaming all the more chilling.

""The Native American wizarding community was particularly gifted in animal and plant magic, its potions in particular being of a sophistication beyond much that was known in Europe.""

That's what J.K. Rowling writes in the first of a four-part essay series, collectively called History of Magic in North America. ""The most glaring difference between magic practised by Native Americans and the wizards of Europe was the absence of a wand.""

It's just one tidbit from the essay titled ""Fourteenth Century  Seventeenth Century"" and published on the Pottermore website on Tuesday.

The writing is full of details to whet fans' appetites ahead of the November release of the Harry Potter spinoff film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Set in New York City in 1926, the movie documents the life of wizard Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne), who wrote the ""Fantastic Beasts"" textbook featured in the Harry Potter series.

For example, Rowling writes that ""while every nationality has its own term for 'Muggle,' the American community uses the slang term No-Maj, short for 'No Magic.' "" The essay also explains the ""legend of the Native American 'skin walker'  an evil witch or wizard that can transform into an animal at will.""

A member of the All Things Considered family has died. Alan Cheuse, who reviewed books on our air nearly every week since the early 1980s, passed away today after a car accident in California two weeks ago. He was 75 years old.

In two minutes every week, Alan paid his respects to good writing in his soft, intense, passionate voice.

Who ever read as much as Alan did? When he wasn't reading, he was teaching  over the years at Bennington, the University of Virginia, University of Michigan, and for the last two-plus decades, at George Mason University. And when he wasn't reading and teaching, he was writing. Five novels, novellas, short stories, textbooks.

It's a miracle that he found time for the solitude and concentration that writing demands: He was at the center of literary life in Washington, D.C., and a truly loving husband, father, and grandfather. But Alan did manage to do it all. Summers in Santa Cruz gave him solitary writing time, and time to teach at the Squaw Valley Writers Workshop. It was driving back from Northern California that he had the car accident.

Alan Cheuse was such a generous man. He always made time for his students. He always had suggestions to us, about writers to keep track of, as well as ones to avoid. He was a wonderful, caring, funny friend, full of stories and totally apt literary quotations. Good gossip too.

Those who knew him will remember him for all of that. Listeners will remember, and thank him, for all the reading in our behalf.

NPR's Kelly McEvers talks to petroleum-geologist-turned-writer Rick Bass about the art of the short story, specifically his short stories. A collection of the short stories he's written over the years is called, For A Little While.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

The life of author Rick Bass is quite a story. He grew up in Houston and became a petroleum geologist. He would write on his lunch breaks. And then, in 1987, he moved to rural Montana and became an environmental activist. Since then, he's written dozens of books - nonfiction, novels, short stories - and won many awards. His new short story collection is called ""For A Little While."" It's a mix of old and new stories. Rick Bass says a short story is the best way to deal with the fast pace of life right now.

RICK BASS: The short story is a beautiful reservoir that you enter. You learn something, and you get out. It fits our brain. It's a unique package, a lozenge, a lens that helps us process all kinds of information. The classic short story form with that elegant, tapered shape - it's not formulaic. It's organic, and it fits who we are as a species.

MCEVERS: Like Rick Bass, many of his characters are off the grid and surrounded by nature. And many of them are incredibly lonely, and so I asked him if loneliness is the price of living so close to the wild.

BASS: I don't think it's the woods that make them lonely. You know, it's just the atoms bouncing around faster and faster. We're being called upon to respond, respond, respond - less downtime, less leisure time, less thinking time, less - no processing time. And when you're tired, you don't have energy for passion. When you're tired or overwhelmed, you don't have the resources to dream a big life, live a big life, and that can present itself in the form of loneliness - like, gee, I wish I had a community where I could just have a meal and sit down and talk for a while. Or I wish I had time to hang out more with my kids, or I wish; I wish; I wish. I think, again, it comes back to a question of time, really. I think time is the - kind of the factor here, and the loneliness - again, not landscape or externalities.

MCEVERS: It's interesting you talk about that because, you know, your stories are very languid, you know? They move at their own pace. Do you feel that they've gotten more so as you've sort of sensed this yearning and need for more time and space?

BASS: I would suspect so. That wouldn't surprise me. What I'm hungering for as a reader is the visuals, the reminders that the world is a beautiful place, and I'm just trying to bring, you know, almost a painterly illumination on sentences, on objects, on subjects. And so there is going to be more attention to the brushwork. And I think we're so hungry to have our five senses engaged-slash-re-engaged, that that's the best way to do it - is with sentences. And the stories will take care of themselves from those sentences.

MCEVERS: There's this one story. It's called ""Pagans.""

BASS: Sure.

MCEVERS: First, can you just describe what's happening in that story and tell us where it's set?

BASS: It's set in Texas on the Gulf Coast in the 1970s, a time of great cultural and sociologic change. The two boys and the girl - they're just navigating adolescence. They're navigating the interesting interface between friendship and romantic love, skipping school and going off and mucking around on the bayou in this really rich, fertile, lush environment that's got a lot of toxins in it from ship channel plumes and so forth. And...

MCEVERS: Yeah. I mean, they're basically playing with these pieces of machinery that have been sunk in the river. The river, you say, is poisoned. They've built kind of an altar out of kind of a pile of garbage, you know? And yet, to them, it is beautiful. I'm wondering if you could read a passage. You have the book, right?

BASS: I do, yeah. I'd be happy to.

MCEVERS: To set this up, the character's looking back. It's at the very end of the story.

BASS: (Reading) He wonders sometimes if there are not the ghost or husks of their other lives living still far back in the past or far below or even further out into the future still together and still consorting other lives birth from that strange reservoir of joy and sweetness and utter newness. And if there are, how does he access that - through memory, through imagination? Even now, he marvels at how wise they were then and at all the paths they did not take.

MCEVERS: The passage is so interesting. You know, it almost sounds like you're talking directly to the reader and this idea that there's another version of this story, and it's being lived out now.

BASS: Yeah, yeah.

MCEVERS: That, to me, seems like what must be the joy of writing - is that you get to think up those versions.

BASS: You're totally on it. And I would not have thought of it myself consciously, but it comes back to this idea of scale and time. You know, as a geologist, one of the mystifying and challenging things about mapping is, you know, unconformities, these vast stretches of settlement deposition that have been re-eroded, washed away. So you'll have an old formation, then the middle formation will be gone. then you'll have a younger formation on top of it. And there'll just be this missing chunk of, you know, 200 million years or something that - and you might find a few fossils down in another formation. And you might have a fault in truth that lifts up older rock up above younger rock. But there's a lot of stuff that happens that we never know about, yeah, you know, under the ground.

MCEVERS: And the fun is filling in the blanks.

BASS: It really is, yeah, and trying to connect dots from just a very few clues.

MCEVERS: Well, Rick Bass, thank you so much for your time today.

BASS: Thank you, Kelly. I appreciate it.

MCEVERS: That's Rick Bass. He's the author of ""For A Little While,"" a new collection of stories new and old. It's out now.

A Reading List For Riding The Rails : NPR,[],"Patricia Highsmith and Agatha Christie made well-known use of the train as a confined setting for their thrillers  but a less well-known example is this violent, mesmerizing book from the great French novelist Emile Zola. It's part of his 20-volume Les Rougon-Macquart cycle, but don't worry, I've been assured that you don't have to read the other 19 if your beach bag just won't fit them and your sunscreen. La Bete Humaine isn't exactly a sunny read, though  it's an exploration of what kinds of murderous tendencies we've all got locked up in our psychological cupboards and how accessible the keys are. The book, with its high body count, is set against the backdrop of the railway between Paris and Le Havre. In just the first chapter a woman confesses to a sexual molestation in her past, is beaten and threatened by her own husband for the sin committed against her, and a plot to murder the molester is concocted. And we haven't even met the other main character, loosely based on Jack the Ripper, whose most potent love affair is with the train. Hey, it's not called The Human Kitten. What's the fun in reading this grisly story, besides the racing plot? It's Zola's exploration of what creates the desire to kill  all experienced from the safety of your own (hopefully) locked cupboard.

npr.org,,Iron Council,[],"Excerpt: Iron Council

Chapter One

A man runs. Pushes through thin bark-and-leaf walls, through the purposeless rooms of Rudewood. The trees crowd him. This far in the forest there are aboriginal noises. The canopy rocks. The man is heavy-burdened, and sweated by the unseen sun. He is trying to follow a trail.

Just before dark he found his place. Dim hotchi paths led him to a basin ringed by roots and stone-packed soil. Trees gave out. The earth was tramped down and stained with scorching and blood. The man spread out his pack and blanket, a few books and clothes. He laid down something well-wrapped and heavy among loam and centipedes.

Rudewood was cold. The man built a fire, and with it so close the darkness shut him quite out, but he stared into it as if he might see something emergent. Things came close. There were constant bits of sound like the bronchial call of a nightbird or the breath and shucking of some unseen predator. The man was wary. He had pistol and rifle, and one at least was always in his hand.

By flamelight he saw hours pass. Sleep took him and led him away again in little gusts. Each time he woke he breathed as if coming out of water. He was stricken. Sadness and anger went across his face.

""I'll come find you,"" he said.

He did not notice the moment of dawn, only that time skidded again and he could see the edges of the clearing. He moved like he was made of twigs, as if he had stored up the night's damp cold. Chewing on dry meat, he listened to the forest's shuffling and paced the dirt depression.

When finally he heard voices he flattened against the bank and looked out between the trunks. Three people approached on the paths of leaf-mould and forest debris. The man watched them, his rifle steadied. When they trudged into thicker shanks of light, he saw them clearly and let his rifle fall.

""Here,"" he shouted. They dropped foolishly and looked for him. He raised his hand above the earth rise.

They were a woman and two men, dressed in clothes more ill-suited to Rudewood than his own. They stood before him in the arena and smiled. ""Cutter."" They gripped arms and slapped his back.

""I heard you for yards. What if you was followed? Who else is coming?""

They did not know. ""We got your message,"" the smaller man said. He spoke fast and looked about him. ""I went and seen. We were arguing. The others were saying, you know, we should stay. You know what they said.""

""Yeah, Drey. Said I'm mad.""

""Not you.""

They did not look at him. The woman sat, her skirt filling with air. She was breathing fast with anxiety. She bit her nails.

""Thank you. For coming."" They nodded or shook Cutter's gratitude off: it sounded strange to him, and he was sure to them too. He tried not to make it sound like his sardonic norm. ""It means a lot."" * * * They waited in the sunken ground, scratched motifs in the earth or carved figures from dead wood. There was too much to say.

""So they told you not to come?""

The woman, Elsie, told him no, not so much, not in those words, but the Caucus had been dismissive of Cutter's call. She looked up at him and down quickly as she spoke. He nodded, and did not criticise.

""Are you sure about this?"" he said, and would not accept their desultory nods. ""Godsdammit are you sure? Turn your back on the Caucus? You ready to do that? For him? It's a long way we've got to go.""

""We already come miles in Rudewood,"" said Pomeroy.

""There's hundreds more. Hundreds. It'll be bastard hard. A long time. I can't swear we'll come back.""

I can't swear we'll come back.

Pomeroy said, ""Only tell me again your message was true. Tell me again he's gone, and where he's gone and what for. Tell me that's true."" The big man glowered and waited, and at Cutter's brief nod and closed eyes, he said, ""Well then.""

Others arrived then. First another woman, Ihona; and then as they welcomed her they heard stick-litter being destroyed in heavy leaps, and a vodyanoi came through the brush. He squatted in the froggish way of his race and raised webbed hands. When he jumped from the bank, his bodyhead and trunk all one fat sacrippled with impact. Fejhechrillen was besmirched and tired, his motion ill-suited to woodland.

They were anxious, not knowing how long they should wait, if any others would come. Cutter kept asking how they had heard his message. He made them unhappy. They did not want to consider their decision to join him: they knew there were many who would think it a betrayal.

""He'll be grateful,"" Cutter said. ""He's a funny bugger and might be he'll not show it, but this'll mean a lot, to me and to him.""

After silence Elsie said: ""You don't know that. He didn't ask us, Cutter. He just got some message, you said. He might be angry that we've come.""

Cutter could not tell her she was wrong. Instead he said: ""I don't see you leaving, though. We're here for us, maybe, as well as for him.""

He began to tell them what might be ahead, emphasising dangers. It seemed as if he wanted to dissuade them though they knew he did not. Drey argued with him in a rapid and nervy voice. He assured Cutter they understood. Cutter saw him persuading himself, and was silent. Drey said repeatedly that his mind was made up.

""We best move,"" said Elsie, when noon went. ""We can't wait forever. Anyone else is coming, they've obviously got lost. They'll have to go back to the Caucus, do what's needed in the city."" Someone gave a little cry and the company turned.

At the hollow's edge a hotchi rider was watching them, astride his gallus. The big war-cockerel plumped its breastfeathers and raised one spurred claw-foot in curious pose. The hotchi, squat and tough hedgehog man, stroked his mount's red comb.

""Militia coming."" His accent was strong and snarling. ""Two men militia coming, a minute, two."" He sat forward in the ornate saddle and turned his bird around. With very little sound, with no metal to jangle on wood-and-leather straps and stirrups, it picked away high-clawed and belligerent, and was hidden by the forest.

""Was that?"" ""What?"" ""Did you fucking?""

But Cutter and his companions were shushed by the sound of approach. They looked in unsaid panic, too late to hide.

Two men came stepping over fungused stumps into view. They were masked and uniformed in the militia's dark grey. Each had a mirrored shield and ungainly pepperpot revolver slack at his side. As they came into the clearing they faltered and were still, taking in the men and women waiting for them.

There was a dragged-out second when no one moved, when befuddled and silent conference was heldare you, are they, what, should we, should we?till someone shot. Then there were a spate of sounds, screams and the percussion of shots. People fell. Cutter could not follow who was where and was gut-terrified that he had been hit and not yet felt it. When the guns' heinous syncopation stopped, he unclenched his jaw.

Someone was calling Oh gods oh fucking gods. It was a militiaman, sitting bleeding from a belly-wound beside his dead friend and trying to hold his heavy pistol up. Cutter heard the curt torn-cloth sound of archery and the militia man lay back with an arrow in him and stopped his noise.

Again a beat of silence then ""Jabber"" ""Are you, is everyone?"" ""Drey? Pomeroy?""

First Cutter thought none of his own were hit. Then he saw how Drey was white and held his shoulder, and that blood dyed his palsying hands.

""Sweet Jabber, man."" Cutter made Drey sit (Is it all right? the little man kept saying.) Bullet had taken muscle. Cutter tore strips from Drey's shirt, and wound those cleanest around the hole. The pain made Drey fight, and Pomeroy and Fejh had to hold him. They gave him a thumb-thick branch to bite while they bandaged him.

""They must've fucking followed you, you halfwit bastards."" Cutter was raging while he worked. ""I told you to be fucking careful""

""We were,"" Pomeroy shouted, jabbing his finger at Cutter.

""Didn't follow them."" The hotchi reappeared, its rooster picking. ""Them patrol the pits. You been here long time, a day nearly."" It dismounted and walked the rim of the arena. ""You been too long.""

It showed the teeth in its snout in some opaque expression. Lower than Cutter's chest but rotundly muscular, it strutted like a bigger man. By the militia it stopped and sniffed. It sat up the one killed by its arrow and began to push the missile through the body.

""When them don't come back, them send more,"" it said. ""Them come after you. Maybe now."" It steered the arrow past bones through the dead chest. It gripped the shaft when it came out the corpse's back, and pulled the fletch through with a wet sound. The hotchi tucked it bloody into his belt, picked the revolving pistol from the militiaman's stiffening fingers and fired it against the hole.

Birds rose up again at the shot. The hotchi snarled with the unfamiliar recoil and shook its hand. The arrow's fingerthick burrow had become a cavity.

Pomeroy said: ""Godspit . . . who in hell are you?""

""Hotchi man. Cock-fighting man. Alectryomach. Help you.""

""Your tribe . . ."" said Cutter. ""They're with us? On our side? Some of the hotchi are with the Caucus,"" he said to the others. ""That's why this place's all right. Or was supposed to be. This lad's clan got no time for the militia. Give us passage. But . . . can't risk a real fight with the city, so they've to make it look like it was us killed the officers, not their arrows."" He understood as he said it.

Pomeroy and the hotchi rifled the killed men together. Pomeroy threw one of the pepperpot revolvers to Elsie, one to Cutter. It was modernistic and expensive and Cutter had never held one before. It was heavy, with its six barrels arranged in a fat rotating cylinder.

""They ain't reliable,"" said Pomeroy, harvesting bullets. ""Fast, though.""

""Jabber . . . we better fucking go."" Drey's voice went up and down with pain. ""Fucking guns going off going to call them for miles . . .""

""Not so many nearby,"" said the hotchi. ""Maybe none to hear. But you should gone, yes. What you for? Why leave city? You looking for him come by on the clay man?""

Cutter looked to the others and they watched him carefully, letting him speak.

He said: ""You seen him?"" He stepped toward the busy hotchi. ""You seen him?""

The world has frozen over in the movie Snowpiercer. Set after a climate change disaster, all the action happens aboard a train that has to keep circling the globe for its passengers to stay alive.

More From The Book Your Trip Series For more great train tales, check out NPR's Book Your Trip series. We've got recommendations for literary travel by train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time machine and even giant peach.

The movie itself is uniquely international: Snowpiercer is based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand and Jean-Marc Rochette. It's directed by a Korean auteur and stars Hollywood A-listers including Tilda Swinton and Ed Harris. The movie opened in South Korea last summer. Since then it has played all over the world, and certain Americans have been wildly impatient for Snowpiercer to open here.

What kinds of Americans, you ask? Well, film nerds, science fiction nerds, Tilda Swinton nerds and fans of director Bong Joon-ho.

Grady Hendrix, who co-runs the New York Asian Film Festival, says Bong's movies, such as 2003's Memories of Murder, masterfully subvert genres. ""His serial killer movie was actually an amazing movie about Korean history but also delivered the thrills you want in a serial killer movie,"" he explains.

And Bong's 2006 movie The Host was both a sly critique of American intervention in Korea dating back to the Korean War  and about a giant monster eating people. The Host smashed South Korean box office records and became an international sensation.

So it was hardly a surprise when the director's next big action film  Snowpiercer  was immediately snapped up by Hollywood distributors Bob and Harvey Weinstein.

""Uncle Harvey. We had a long process,"" Bong wryly remembers during an interview at NPR West in Culver City.

Snowpiercer's U.S. release was delayed for months as Bong and Weinstein  known in the film world as Harvey Scissorhands  wrangled over Weinstein's insistence over cutting 20 minutes from the two-hour film and adding a voice-over. Bong adamantly refused. The international film community rallied behind Bong Joon-ho. Eventually, the Weinsteins agreed to release Snowpiercer intact.

""Their idea to simplify was a very silly one,"" Hendrix observes. ""The movie is incredibly simple. It is a train. The poor people live in the back. The rich people live in the front. And the poor people in back want to get to the front.""

Bong says an oppressed underclass rebelling against huge wealth gaps is not exactly science fiction right now. ""[It's] similar to Occupy Wall Street in terms of the 99 percent versus the 1 percent,"" he says. ""That's something that happens in other countries and also in Korea.""

The film has been getting rave reviews, partly because of Bong's knack for keeping viewers off balance. Take a meditative, dreamlike scene where the freedom fighters pause for a snack in a train car that's also an aquarium and a sushi counter. (Of course, sushi is sort of shorthand for the preferred food of the 1 percent.)

It's really about having fun with the audience. People go to the movies with certain genre conventions in mind. They go to the movies to have certain expectations met. It's always fun to play around with those expectation

""Outside the window, you can see the frozen ocean, where the fish inside the tanks used to swim,"" Bong says.

Before the ocean was ruined  partly to make this food. Such pointed, ironic juxtapositions are Bong's stock in trade.

""It's really about having fun with the audience,"" he explains. ""People go to the movies with certain genre conventions in mind. They go to the movies to have certain expectations met. It's always fun to play around with those expectations, to deliver what they came to see, but also give them things they didn't expect.""

Like a message about income inequality or environmental cataclysm  in a high-octane summer action flick. That's what Bong delivers  along with violence, explosions and special effects.",[]

WHAT, you might ask, is Anna Karenina doing on the same summer reading list as The Little Engine That Could?

Let me explain.

In previous summers, we gave you lists and lists and lists of new books organized by genre. And that was fun. But this summer we wanted to try something different.

Back in December, when we worked on the year-end 2013 Best Books Concierge, one of the things we enjoyed most was finding common threads in very different books (just look at the unlikely titles that live together under the ""Funny Stuff"" category, or the ""Family Matters"" category). And that's how we ended up settling on this year's Book Your Trip project  a series that is much more about the journey than the destination, and aims to create a surprising, serendipitous book discovery experience for the summer months.

In March, the NPR Books team  Petra Mayer, Nicole Cohen, Rose Friedman and myself  reached out to our trusted reviewers, librarians and Arts Desk colleagues and asked them to brainstorm books that featured themes or memorable scenes of transportation and transit. As usual, they wrote back with hundreds of titles  both old and new. We spent the next month or so sorting those books  recommended by Lynn Neary, Michele Norris, Nancy Pearl, Maureen Corrigan, Neda Ulaby and many more. (You can hear Petra talk more about that process with Linda Wertheimer in the audio at the top of this page.)

Do LSD trips count? (Yes!) Can we call 'time' a mode of transit, or do we have to say time machine? (Eh. Still not sure. We couldn't agree.) Do the dogs and cat who travel by paw in 'The Incredible Journey' qualify for the 'by foot' list? (Sure, why not!) What do we do with 'James and the Giant Peach'? (Create a big 'miscellaneous' list, obviously.)

There were some pretty straightforward categories  train, plane, bike, boat ... but it didn't take long for things to get squirrelly. Do LSD trips count? (Yes!) Can we call ""time"" a mode of transit, or do we have to say time machine? (Eh. Still not sure. We couldn't agree.) Do the dogs and cat who travel by paw in The Incredible Journey qualify for the ""by foot"" list? (Sure, why not!) What do we do with James and the Giant Peach? (Create a big ""miscellaneous"" list, obviously.)

It wasn't always pretty, but eventually we settled on 12 lists: train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time and a miscellaneous category that includes drugs, dragons and giant peaches. (A moment of silence here for a fun list called ""Connections"" that included books featuring multiple modes of transit  like Nellie Bly's Around the World in Seventy-Two Days. Things were just getting too unwieldy, and it didn't make the cut.)

Speaking of things that didn't make the cut: These lists are not comprehensive. They aren't even a little comprehensive. Months before we pressed publish, we were bracing ourselves for the inevitable: NPR, HOW DARE YOU PUBLISH A LIST OF HORSE BOOKS AND NOT INCLUDE [INSERT NAME OF FAVORITE HORSE BOOK HERE]  I'LL NEVER DONATE ANOTHER DIME!!

Honestly, these lists could have gone on forever. We had to stop somewhere. So please don't stop supporting your local member station because Misty of Chincoteague didn't make it. (If you must know: It's because we decided it was about horses, but not horses as a mode of transit). We tried to select an idiosyncratic mix of old and new, known and unknown, and books for new and experienced readers alike. The point is book discovery, so we didn't always pick obvious books; we hope browsing this series feels like wandering into an unfamiliar section of the library.

On the car list, you'll find 'Go, Dog, Go!' and 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.' And  perhaps for the first time ever  Che Guevara and Beverly Cleary are hanging out together with 'The Motorcycle Diaries' and 'The Mouse and the Motorcycle.'

Our favorite thing about these lists is the surprising and funny combinations you get when you decide to look at a very specific slice of something. We love that Anna Karenina and The Little Engine That Could are side by side. On the car list, you'll find Go, Dog. Go! and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. And  perhaps for the first time ever  Che Guevara and Beverly Cleary are hanging out together with The Motorcycle Diaries and The Mouse and the Motorcycle.

Is this a useful way to organize books? We're not really sure. But it was a fun and interesting exercise, and it made us all add a bunch of new titles to our own reading lists. We hope you'll find some books that are new to you as well. Stay tuned in the coming months  our friends on the Arts Desk will be bringing you Book Your Trip stories on-air. (Bob Mondello has had us tapping our toes to transit-themed show tunes for weeks.)

And of course, outrage aside, we really would like to hear about the books that you would add to the lists. So please share your favorites with us in the comments section of the lists, or tweet them with the hashtag #bookyourtrip.

As always, we know you have a choice when you listen, so we'd like to thank you for choosing NPR Airwaves. You are now free to move about the cabin.",[]

He announced his diagnosis on Facebook almost three weeks ago, saying ""I intend to fight it hard.""

Today's statement from Todd Doughty, executive director of publicity at Doubleday included comments from Conroy's wife and his longtime editor:

i Matailong Du/NPR Matailong Du/NPR

In 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, by a vote of 8 to 1, to uphold a state's right to forcibly sterilize a person considered unfit to procreate. The case, known as Buck v. Bell, centered on a young woman named Carrie Buck, whom the state of Virginia had deemed to be ""feebleminded.""

Author Adam Cohen tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that Buck v. Bell was considered a victory for America's eugenics movement, an early 20th century school of thought that emphasized biological determinism and actively sought to ""breed out"" traits that were considered undesirable.

""There were all kinds of categories of people who were deemed to be unfit [to procreate],"" Cohen says. ""The eugenicists looked at evolution and survival of the fittest, as Darwin was describing it, and they believed 'We can help nature along, if we just plan who reproduces and who doesn't reproduce.' ""

All told, as many as 70,000 Americans were forcibly sterilized during the 20th century. The victims of state-mandated sterilization included people like Buck who had been labeled ""mentally deficient,"" as well as those who who were deaf, blind and diseased. Minorities, poor people and ""promiscuous"" women were often targeted.

Cohen's new book about the Buck case, Imbeciles, takes its name from the terms eugenicists used to categorize the ""feebleminded."" In it, he revisits the Buck v. Bell ruling and explores the connection between the American eugenics movement and the rise of the Nazi party in Germany.

Cohen notes that the instinct to ""demonize"" people who are different is still prevalent in the U.S. today, particularly in the debate over immigration.

""I think these instincts to say that we need to stop these other people from 'polluting us,' from changing the nature of our country, they're very real,"" Cohen warns. ""The idea that those who don't remember the past are condemned to repeat it  it's very troubling that we don't remember this past.""

Interview Highlights

On the case of Carrie Buck

This is this poor young woman, really nothing wrong with her physically or mentally, a victim of a terrible sexual assault, and there's a little hearing, she's declared feebleminded and she gets sent off to the colony for epileptics and feebleminded. ...

Imbeciles The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck by Adam Cohen Hardcover, 402 pages | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

When she's at the colony, the guy who is running the colony, Dr. Albert Priddy, is on the prowl. He's looking for someone to put at the center of this test case that they want to bring, so he's looking for someone to sterilize, and he sees Carrie Buck when she comes in, he does the examination himself, and there are a lot of things about her that excite him. She is deemed to be feebleminded, she has a mother who is feebleminded, so that's good because you can show some genetics, and then they're hoping that [her] baby could be determined to be feebleminded too, then you could really show a genetic pattern of feeblemindedness. The fact that she had been pregnant out of wedlock was another strike against her. So he fixes on her and thinks Carrie Buck is going to be the perfect potential plaintiff. ...

He chooses her, and then under the Virginia law, they have to have a sterilization hearing at the colony, which they do and they give her a lawyer (who is really not a lawyer for her; it's really someone who had been the chairman of the board of the colony and was sympathetic to the colony's side) and they have a bit of a sham hearing where she is determined to be a suitable person for sterilization; they vote to sterilize her, and that is the order that then gets challenged by Carrie as the plaintiff first in the Virginia court system and then in the Supreme Court.

On why he considers Buck v. Bell to be one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in American history

If you start by just looking at all the human misery that was inflicted, about 70,000 Americans were sterilized as a result of this decision, so that's an awful lot of people who wanted to have children who weren't able to have children. Also, we have to factor in all the many people who were being segregated, who were being held in these institutions for eugenic reasons, because they were feebleminded, whose lives unfolded living in places like the colony, rather than living in freedom. Beyond the human effect though, there was something just so ugly about this decision and when [we] think about what we want the Supreme Court to be, what the founders wanted the Supreme Court to be, it was supposed to be our temple of justice, the place that people could go when all the other parts of our society, all the other parts of the government, were not treating them right.

On how eugenicists sought to address the ""threat"" to the gene pool

The eugenicists saw two threats to the national gene pool: One was the external one, which they were addressing through immigration law; the other was the internal one  what to do about the people who were already here. They had a few ideas.

The first eugenics law in the United States was passed in Connecticut in 1895, and it was a law against certain kinds of marriages. They were trying to stop certain unfit people from reproducing through marriage. It wasn't really what they wanted, though, because they realized that people would just reproduce outside of marriage.

So their next idea was what they called segregation. The idea was to get people who were deemed unfit institutionalized during their reproductive years, particularly for women, keep them there, make sure they didn't reproduce, and then women were often let go when they had passed their reproductive years because they were no longer a threat to the gene pool. That had a problem too, though. The problem was that it would be really expensive to segregate, institutionalize the number of people the eugenicists were worried about. ...

Their next idea was eugenic sterilization and that allowed for a model in which they would take people in to institutions, eugenically sterilize them, and then they could let them go, because they were no longer a threat. That's why eugenic sterilization really became the main model that the eugenicists embraced and that many states enacted laws to allow.

On deeming people ""feebleminded""

""Feebleminded"" was really the craze in American eugenics. There was this idea that we were being drowned in a tide of feeblemindedness  that basically unintelligent people were taking over, reproducing more quickly than the intelligent people  but it was also a very malleable term that was used to define large categories of people that again, were disliked by someone who was in the decision-making position. So, women who were thought to be overly interested in sex, licentious, were sometimes deemed feebleminded. It was a broad category and it was very hard to prove at one of these feeblemindedness hearings that you were not feebleminded.

On the involuntary sterilization procedure

For men it was something like a vasectomy. For women it was a salpingectomy, where they cauterized the path that the egg takes toward fertilization. It was, in the case of women, not minor surgery and when you read about what happened, it's many, many days of recovery and it had certain dangers attached to it, and a lot of the science was still quite new. ...

When you add onto all that, the fact that in many, many cases the women involved were not told what was being done to them, they might be told that they were having an appendectomy, they weren't being told that the government has decided that you are unfit to reproduce and we're then going to have surgery on you, so that just compounds the horror of the situation.

On how the Nazis borrowed from the U.S. eugenics sterilization program

We really were on the cutting edge. We were doing a lot of this in the 1910s and 1920s. Indiana adopted a eugenic sterilization law, America's first in 1907. We were writing the eugenics sterilization statutes that decided who should be sterilized. We also had people who were writing a lot of what might be thought of as pro-Aryan theory. So you have people like Madison Grant who wrote a very popular book called The Passing of a Great Race, which really talked about the superiority of Nordics, as he called them, and how they were endangered by all the brown people and the non-Nordics who were taking over.

On a 1924 immigration law, which was inspired by eugenicists, that prevented Anne Frank's family from entering the U.S.

Under the old immigration laws where it was pretty much ""show up,"" they would've been able to emigrate, but suddenly they were trapped by very unfavorable national quotas, so this really was a reason that so many Jews were turned away.

One very poignant aspect of it that I've thought about as I was working on the book is in the late '90s some correspondence appeared, was uncovered, in which Otto Frank was writing repeatedly to the State Department begging for visas for himself and his wife and his two daughters, Margot and Anne, and was turned down, and that was because there were now these quotas in place. If they had not been, it seems clear that he would've been able to get a visa for his whole family, including his daughter Anne Frank.

So when we think about the fact that Anne Frank died in a concentration camp, we're often told that it was because the Nazis believed the Jews were genetically inferior, that they were lesser than Aryans. That's true, but to some extent Anne Frank died in a concentration camp because the U.S. Congress believed that as well.",[]

SOMINI SENGUPTA: They join the labor force. They register to vote. They embrace the Internet, many of them for the first time. They fall in love. And all those things change their own country profoundly.

SHAPIRO: It's a country with a democratic government, a country with constitutional guarantees. And that means it's a country with enormous expectations and challenges.

SENGUPTA: One is how to level the playing field so that there's at least some equality of opportunity for both men and women and, I would argue, particularly women who have really not enjoyed the equality that the Constitution of India had promised them 70 years ago. And the other related challenge is how much to let this generation speak their mind. India has always had a very ambivalent relationship with free expression, and that is all the more pronounced now during the Internet age.

SHAPIRO: Somini Sengupta follows seven young people and their aspirations in her latest book, ""The End Of Karma: Hope And Fury Among India's Young.""

SENGUPTA: I call this ""The End Of Karma"" because the people I write about - they're all trying to overcome their past. They were born with one destiny. They are trying to make another. And they're all stories of incredible grit and resilience and great hope but also a bit of fury - quite a bit of fury, which is why the subtitle of the book is ""Hope And Fury Among India's Young.""

SHAPIRO: And this idea of trying to overcome your past - how new is that for India - that your past is not necessarily destined to be your future.

SENGUPTA: I'll tell you the story of one child who I met in reporting this book. Her name what's in reporting this book. Her name is Varsha (ph). She was the daughter of what's known as a presswala (ph). Her family had a business pressing clothes at the end of a block under a tree. And ever since Varsha was a small girl, she would go around collecting the rumpled bundles of clothes, and she would help her parents pressing them - saris and salwar kameezes and button-down shirts. And the one thing she didn't want to be was a presswala or a presswala's wife. And she really, really wanted to be a cop, a policewoman.

And her father, who was her great champion, was also very much against this idea. He wanted to marry her off to a good family, and he couldn't bear the idea of her being a policewoman. So the story of Varsha is really the story of a girl who tries to overcome her past, who tries to grow wings and a story of a father who has to decide how far he will let her go.

SHAPIRO: Do you expect that five years from now she'll be a police officer or a presswala or something else?

SENGUPTA: I think it depends largely on how hard Varsha is willing to push. She has already pushed her father to go quite a mile. Her father did not want her to even finish high school or go to college. He was very nervous about what would happen to her, and she's managed to push him ever so steadily just by dint of determination and resilience. But she has also had to tamp down her dreams every step of the way.

SHAPIRO: So many of the stories in this book reminded me of stories we hear about early 20th century America. And almost the minute that thought entered my head, (laughter) I reached the sentence you wrote, this country is not a country of Horatio Algers, referring, of course, to the quintessential story of transcending destiny in early 20th century America. So while many of the stories do follow this model that the U.S. seems to have followed a hundred years ago, you're saying, no, there's a big difference here.

SENGUPTA: Well, I think the myth of Horatio Alger has increasingly been shown to be a myth even in our own country. But I think you're absolutely right that the parallels between India and the United States are just remarkable. India was a very unlikely country at its birth in 1947. It was made up of a bunch of different ethnicities, a lot of different languages. And frankly, there were a lot of naysayers who said there's no way that a country that is so poor, that is so diverse is ever going to hold together.

It did hold together, and it has made some remarkable gains since independence. My parents, who were born during the independence era - they're called midnight's children. In their time, life expectancy was 32, and today, it's 66. In their time, infant mortality rates were sky high, and now it's diminished remarkably. In my father's time, when he went to school, there were fewer than half of all Indian children who were enrolled in school. They certainly didn't include dalits or outcasts. They certainly didn't include many girls. And today, nearly all Indian children are in school.

SHAPIRO: Your parents, who, as you say, came of age in the era of Indian independence, were known as midnight's children, a phrase made famous by Salman Rushdie in his novel. You call this young generation noonday's children. Explain what that means.

SENGUPTA: This generation of Indians, because their expectations are so high, they are so demanding and so restive in many ways that I think of India at this moment as a country at high noon. And I'll tell you one story. I remember going out to a school in rural India in a state called Bihar. And it was wintertime, and it was early in the morning. It was a bright, sunny, crisp morning. The mist was rising from the fields. And all these children were just streaming into school, carrying these empty rice sacks because that's what they would sit on. There was not enough chairs or tables or benches for them, and so they would spread them out on the floor, on the grass outside of school, and they would try to get an education.

Now, I went there with a remarkable Indian NGO called Bhutan. They were trying to assess what children were actually learning in school. And as it turned out, half of all fifth-graders couldn't read a basic sentence. Half of all fifth-graders couldn't subtract. And these were children who had been in school for five years. And I'll never forget what one of the social workers who I accompanied - he said to me, you know, when these children grow up, they'll curse us. They'll say, we came to school, and we learned nothing.

SHAPIRO: And your commitment to these people whose stories you tell really comes across in the book where, again and again, I was struck by the number of times you would follow up with a 14-year-old as a 17-year-old (laughter) or an 18-year-old as a 21-year-old, not just tracking their stories but perhaps giving them career advice and helping provide perspective. You come across as very, very invested in these stories.

SENGUPTA: Well, thank you. I did get pretty close to all of these young people, some more than others. And I have to say, I had to resist giving the girl that I described earlier, Varsha - I had to resist giving her too much career advice because I did, at one point, consider giving her the form - the application form to fill out for the Indian Police Service. And then I stopped myself. I thought, well, you know, that's for her to do.

SHAPIRO: Somini Sengupta covers the United Nations for The New York Times, and her new book is called ""The End Of Karma: Hope And Fury Among India's Young"" - great talking to you. Thank you so much.

SENGUPTA: Thank you, Ari.

From Chuck Holmes:

Please use separatist fighters and their Russian allies to describe the anti-government forces in eastern Ukraine. Using separatist fighters alone could suggest that only locals are involved.

Kevin Beesley and Corey Flintoff offer the following guidance:

Pro-Russian Separatists could mislead our audience into thinking that most of the fighting is being done by local fighters. There is a lot of evidence that most, though not all, of the anti-government forces involved are Russian citizens  although Russia denies its military is directly involved. So weve come up with another construction that we think more accurately reflects the situation on the ground: Separatist fighters and their Russian allies. As in: After weeks of heavy fighting, a strategic town in eastern Ukraine has fallen to separatist fighters and their Russian allies.

i toggle caption Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty Images Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty Images

An investigation into a clinical test in France that left one person dead and put five in the hospital has found evidence of brain damage in people who took high doses of the experimental pain medicine.

The early-stage clinical study, conducted by Biotrial in France, was halted in January when the side effects surfaced. It was the first time the drug, made by the Portuguese company Bial and known as ""BIA 10-2474,"" was tested in humans.

A report released Monday by a committee of scientists says people who got high cumulative doses of the drug sustained damage to their brains, specifically the hippocampus and pons. Those who got lower doses had no consistent adverse reactions.

The reports says the patients' symptoms and injuries were ""completely unusual, with no relatedness to a known disease or toxicity.""

Previous tests in rats, mice, dogs and monkeys involved doses up to 650 times those given to human subjects. While some animals had brain damage or died when given extremely high doses, there were no consistent signs indicating the drug would be unsafe for humans.

The molecule is meant to inhibit an enzyme called fatty acid amide hydrolase with a central role in the endocannabinoid system, a set of receptors also involved in processing THC, an ingredient in marijuana.

In all, 90 people took the experimental drug, at different doses. The six who were hospitalized had gotten the highest dose, which was 10 to 40 times higher than that needed to completely block the enzyme.

""We don't know by what mechanism the molecule caused these lesions, and I fear we won't know it for a long time since they couldn't have been due to the endocannabinoid system that was targeted by the molecule,"" Dr. Bernard Begaud, who leads the scientific committee investigating the incident, told the French publication Sciences et Avenir.

Two similar compounds were abandoned by other companies because they weren't deemed effective.

Often, the intensity of a drug's side effects increase with the dose. But in this case, the investigators note, there was no sign of a linear pattern. People who received a cumulative dose less than 200 milligrams were, for the most part, fine. But all six patients who received a cumulative dose higher than 250 milligrams had ""serious central nervous system symptoms.""

At those doses, the report authors hypothesize, the molecule may have suppressed the target enzyme too much, preventing it from breaking down other chemicals. That may have allowed a chemical like anandamide, which is present in chocolate in tiny amounts, to build up to dangerous concentrations in the brain.

Another idea is that the molecule acted on unintended enzymes or that it produced toxic byproducts in the brain.

The group, set up by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, will reconvene later this month to review hypotheses on what went wrong and to make recommendations to the French government to improve clinical trial regulations.

The committee has also asked Bial to explain why the company did preliminary studies in four species of animals, as opposed to the usual two, why it decided to continue studies on the potential pain reliever when it only worked in two animal tests, and why it chose to test such high cumulative doses in people.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is also investigating the case. The agency said in late January that while this drug hasn't been tested in the U.S., there are studies on other drugs that work the same way.",[]

In a decision that triggers hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of payments to consumers, the Supreme Court on Monday denied Apple's request to hear its appeal of a lower court's ruling that the tech company had illegally fixed prices with publishers of e-books.

""The Justice Department says today's decision means Apple's liability in the price fixing case is settled once and for all,"" NPR's Lynn Neary reports. ""The Supreme Court let stand a $450 million settlement reached in a lower court in 2014.""

All of the publishers that were named in the case have already settled with the government, paying a combined $166 million.

In late 2014, Apple settled a class-action lawsuit over e-book pricing that had been brought by consumers and 33 U.S. states, but the payments in that case were predicated upon the outcome of Apple's appeal of the federal antitrust case. Today's rejection by the Supreme Court triggers Apple's payment of some $400 million to people who bought e-books.

""Most e-book purchasers will receive reimbursement for the higher prices Apple's conduct caused them to pay through automatic credits at their e-book retailers,"" the Justice Department says. ""They will be able to apply these credits to future purchases.""

The case's roots date back at least six years, when Apple sold its first iPad models and sought to compete with books giant Amazon as well as Barnes and Noble (both companies had already released their own e-book devices). Apple also launched an e-book marketplace for the iPad  and it was found to have conspired with five large book publishers to set prices that were higher than Amazon's.

Back in 2013, NPR reported that Apple's CEO Steve Jobs had been found to have sent an email to News Corp. executive James Murdoch, urging the participation of News Corp. property HarperCollins, including this line: ""Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream ebooks market at $12.99 and $14.99.""",[]

As part of NPR's ""Book Your Trip"" series, TV critic Eric Deggans looks at a different kind of summertime journey, described in two books that became TV shows: PBS's documentary Freedom Summer, debuting tonight, and The Hallmark Channel's The Watsons Go to Birmingham.

When I was a kid in the mid-1970s, friends around my Indiana hometown talked about summers ""down South"" like they were heading to Disney World.

The trip was an annual, comforting ritual for black families up North with roots in the Deep South.

But there was a time, just a decade earlier, when traveling down South could mean taking your life in your hands if you were black.

""Spending a summer in Mississippi taught me a lot about this country,"" says volunteer Karin Kunstler in the first moments of PBS's American Experience documentary Freedom Summer. ""My high school social studies teacher taught me that we all have rights. Mississippi summer taught me that we didn't all have rights.""

Watch a Preview of 'Freedom Summer' PBS YouTube

Kunstler was one of more than 700 mostly white student volunteers who headed to Mississippi in the summer of 1964 to challenge segregation. Freedom Summer tells the tumultuous, emotional story of that journey, using archival photos and fresh interviews with the participants to re-create one of the most dangerous summertime trips of that time.

Volunteers rode buses from Ohio to Mississippi, where they would live with black families scattered throughout the state.

At first, they felt a joyous excitement known as a ""freedom high,"" says Freedom Summer author Bruce Watson. But then, reality hit home.

""There was a lot of singing, a lot of freedom songs being sung on the bus, until they reached Mississippi,"" Watson says. ""And then, in most cases, the buses were met at the state line by highway patrolmen, who had known, of course, that they were coming. And many volunteer[s] told me that at that point, when they crossed the line, the singing stopped and it got very serious from then on.""

Once in Mississippi, volunteers faced another journey, learning to live in the crushing poverty and strict segregation suffered by their hosts.

""It's 100 years of Jim Crow ... that insisted that black people defer to whites in a way that was really shocking to everyone from the North,"" says Watson. ""Black people had to get off the sidewalk if a white person approached; black people were never called by Mr. or Mrs., they were always called by their first name or just 'boy.' All of these things, the degradation and poverty, was really startling to the volunteers, even though they had been told about it.""

Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District of Columbia in Congress, was a law student in 1964 who helped develop training programs for Freedom Summer volunteers.

""It's very different, even for a black kid ... going [down South] in '63 or '64,"" says Norton. ""Because then you're going with the civil rights movement in hand. So you're going critical of the environment ... which is something you might not have done in the 1950s.""

Norton also saw racist violence up close, when she tried to rescue noted activist Fannie Lou Hamer from a Mississippi jail.

toggle caption Annette Brown/Hallmark Channel

""When I asked to see Miss Hamer, this storied woman leader of the civil rights movement in the South that she was to become, she had been beaten unmercifully by a black trusty,"" she says. ""And [the white prison guards] told him, if you don't beat her [hard enough], we'll see just how you beat her and we're going to beat you even harder.""

But even the worst violence, the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, didn't keep volunteers away.

For a less violent, more personal journey, viewers can watch the Hallmark Channel's adaptation of The Watsons Go to Birmingham. It's a story about an unassuming black family caught up in the civil rights struggle while visiting relatives in Alabama  a perfect metaphor for the bitttersweet experience of traveling south back then, according to the book's author, Christopher Paul Curtis.

""When people would discuss about going south, there would be almost this idyllic tone to what they were saying,"" Curtis says. ""And you know that's not quite true, when people are being lynched and you can't have certain jobs and take care of things like that. But I think it's human nature ... [to] gloss over the bad things and remember the good.""

In one scene, the parents must tell their children how rules for travel are different in the deep South than in their Michigan hometown, noting they'll be traveling during daylight and exercising care about where they make rest stops.

Curtis says he based such scenes on information he got from older relatives who once traveled in the segregated South. ""When African-American people would travel from the North to the South, you had to do a lot of planning beforehand,"" he adds. ""There were actually books that told black people where they could stop, that gave restaurants that were either black owned or would serve black people.""

The contrast between both shows is telling. The Hallmark Channel movie features a family who joins the civil rights struggle, almost by accident. PBS's Freedom Summer shows volunteers who deliberately challenged injustice.

But both TV programs also depict another important journey: how the nation was led away from segregation by people willing to take a dangerous stand for equality.",[]

It took Abdul Arian months to realize that his decision to migrate from his home country, Afghanistan, to Germany was a huge mistake.

He set off nearly a year ago, hoping to be granted asylum so that he could go to university and study psychology.

His journey, organized by smugglers, was long and perilous. Arian, 24, says he nearly drowned off the shores of Greece, when the inflatable dinghy he was traveling in capsized.

He says he and his fellow travelers got lost somewhere in Hungary and walked through the rain for 24 hours before they found the path again.

Yet the reason that Arian finally saw his mistake was not because something nasty or dangerous happened to him. It was because nothing really happened at all.

When Arian arrived in Germany, he was placed in a migrants' reception center.

""We had nothing to do in the camp,"" he says. ""We just stayed there.""

He played a lot of soccer. He ate a lot of jelly sandwiches. He moped about. Officials wrote down his name. In the end, he says, he was in Germany for 10 months, yet ""no one asked me why I went there and why I was there."" No one seemed to want to listen to him explain why he should be allowed to stay.

It also soon became clear to Arian that local Germans did not appreciate his presence. While people from the church and social workers helped the migrants and were ""very nice,"" residents of the nearby village seemed hostile.

""When we were walking along the sidewalk, people would avoid us,"" says Arian.

Germany Says Many Must Leave

Last year, 150,000 Afghans arrived in Germany. The German authorities estimate less that half qualify for asylum.

German officials say at present a tiny number of Afghans  1,600, according to estimates given to them by Afghan officials in Germany  are willing to go back home voluntarily.

But many will have to leave, says Germany's ambassador to Afghanistan, Markus Potzel.

""It means that more than half of them have to be sent back because they can't stay,"" says Potzel. ""There are some obstacles for them to be sent back immediately, but we have a huge number of Afghans who are not eligible to stay in Germany and should be sent back.""

During Arian's time in Germany, he began to notice that Syrian migrants were being treated very differently. They were provided with language lessons and eventually passports, he says.

""When we complained to the social workers, they responded frankly. They said, 'We've invited Syrians here, not Afghans,' "" he says.

This prompted some of Arian's fellow Afghans to stage demonstrations.

""They were shouting, 'We don't want to go back to Afghanistan! There is a war there!' "" he says. ""But no one listened to them.""

The weeks rolled by. Arian was moved to another center. But still nothing happened. He grew steadily more convinced that he had no chance of being allowed to stay in Germany. Then depression set in.

""I was in very bad condition. I couldn't sleep. I decided to go back to Afghanistan, before I went crazy,"" he says.

Arian returned home last month. He was one of 125 Afghans sent back to Afghanistan on a charter flight organized by the German and Afghan governments. The passengers all signed a form saying they were returning voluntarily.

Arian's family spent most of their savings on his trip to Germany. To pay the smuggler's bill of $7,500, they sold land and a car. Arian is now worrying about what his family feels about that.

""So far, I haven't seen any reaction from them because I've just arrived back. But I don't know what's in their hearts,"" he says.

Arian is faced with finding work amid rampant unemployment in a society where good jobs are very hard to find without political or personal connections  or cash for a hefty bribe.

Humiliation For Some

That much is clear from the experience of Shirdil Bayat, 40. He was deported from Denmark two years ago, after a court rejected his request for asylum  which he'd based on a claim that his life was threatened by the Taliban in his home city, Kandahar.

Lacking personal connections, Bayat took 16 months to find permanent work as an office cleaner in the capital, Kabul. He says returning home to Kandahar is still too risky. On a recent day when he was interviewed by NPR, he'd been laid off because of budget cuts. He says he has no idea what he'll do next.

Bayat says returning to Afghanistan after having failed in Europe can be very humiliating. Some families are sympathetic, but far from all.

""People jeer at you. They ask, 'Why did so-and-so get citizenship in Europe while you did not? Maybe you're useless,' "" he says.

The Germans are running a PR campaign in Afghanistan, trying to deter Afghans from traveling to their land. They've posted announcements on billboards, buses and the Internet, urging Afghans to think twice before setting off.

Germany views many of the Afghans who've arrived on its soil as economic migrants seeking jobs or education.

German officials maintain that under international law, Germany is not required to grant asylum to those migrants  unlike Syrians, who are fleeing a war zone.

The United Nations estimates that last year, some 11,000 civilians were killed or injured by conflict in Afghanistan. Afghans say that bolsters proof that there is war in Afghanistan, too  and that Afghans should therefore be granted protection by European nations.

""Afghans are not leaving Afghanistan because of a lack of jobs, "" says Ashraf Haidari, director-general of policy and strategy at Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry. ""They are fleeing generalized violence. Terrorism that is killing men, women and children,"" he says. ""That - and political uncertainty as a result of withdrawal of international forces and diminishing international development aid.""

Germany Draws A Distinction

However, Potzel, Germany's ambassador, says the situation in Afghanistan differs hugely from Syria's.

""Here in Afghanistan, you don't have a government who would bomb their own population,"" he says. ""Here, the government tries to protect their own people. There are unsafe regions and there are less unsafe regions in Afghanistan, and there are regions  especially in the big cities  where a sort of normal life is going on.""

Germany is one of the main international donors to Afghanistan. Over the last 14 years, it has poured a great deal of money into the country. It seems unlikely that it would wish to risk making Afghanistan still more unstable by forcibly returning large numbers of Afghans over a short time span.

Yet there is considerable concern in Afghanistan about what might happen if significant numbers of angry and disillusioned young Afghans are eventually sent back from Europe.

Some European countries provide financial support packages to help people settle in, but the sums are generally small and over a limited time period.

Professor Sayed Masoud, an economist based in Kabul, foresees ""disaster.""

""Either they will join the Taliban or become drug addicts,"" he says, ""because the government can't provide jobs.""

Meanwhile, Afghans keep heading on the trail to Europe. On a recent early morning in Kabul, hundreds of men were lined up outside the government office that issues passports.

Among them was Wahidullah Mohammadi, 19, who wants to migrate to Europe to go to school. He is aware of the risk of being deported back home  and of losing the thousands of dollars he'll pay to smugglers.

Still, he still thinks the odds are worth it.

""The situation is not good here and there is no guaranteed future,"" he says. ""This is why I have to accept this risk.""",[]

While most of the country would be happy never to hear the word ""Deflategate"" ever again, people named Goodell are still very concerned with the year-old scandal and whether New England Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady tampered with game balls.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell  whose four-game suspension of Brady was overturned by a judge  is likely keeping a close eye on the Deflategate case as it winds its way through federal appeals court. But there's another Goodell committed to proving Brady didn't do it.

Ben Goodell, a seventh-grader from Lynn, Mass., dedicated his science fair project to measuring how weather conditions affected the PSI [pounds per square inch] of footballs in a bid to prove the Patriots did nothing illicit.

""I wanted to prove that Tom Brady is innocent,"" the 12-year-old St. Pius V Elementary School student, who isn't related to the NFL commissioner, told local TV station NECN.

And his project won.

Goodell was one of approximately 120 students who participated in the school's annual science fair, and one of only eight to win the Outstanding Project Award, according to The Daily Item. The newspaper reports Goodell began his experiment with a football inflated to the NFL standard and then exposed it to different weather conditions, including humidity, snow, wind chill, cold and ice.

""Every time, it dropped two PSI [pounds per square inch],"" Goodell, a Patriots fan, told the Item. ""The lowest PSI recorded during deflategate was 2 PSI under proper inflation.""

Principal Paul D. Maestranzi said the goal of the science fair is to get students to try and answer an everyday question.

""It's more tied in with current thinking,"" he told the newspaper. ""I think some people think science is only in a laboratory. It's really all around us all the time. That's what gets kids hooked: relevance.""

So, kudos to Ben Goodell for his experiment. Hopefully, Deflategate  the stale and bungled controversy that it is  will soon cease to be relevant.",[]

Please avoid referring to the people in Baltimore who have injured police officers, started fires, looted stores and vandalized properties as simply protesters.

Reports from Baltimore indicate that some people are taking advantage of the situation to lash out at authorities or to grab what they can from businesses. Those are not just protesters in the sense of the word that normally comes to mind.

Likewise, it is too simple to say that protests turned violent. That paints a picture of a peaceful gathering that changed into a rock-throwing, tear-gas flying confrontation between citizens and police. Reports from Baltimore indicate thats not been the case in many instances.

As in other cases weve discussed, its wise to avoid labels. In this case, protesters is a label thats too broad. The better approach is to focus on action words and describe whats been happening.

On a Newscast this morning, Dave Mattingly said that rioting [in Baltimore] yesterday injured 15 police officers. More than a dozen buildings and nearly 150 vehicles were set on fire. He noted that the violence followed the funeral for 25-year-old Freddie Gray.

Korva Coleman used similar language, saying that Gov. Larry Hogan has declared a state of emergency in Baltimore, after rioting broke out yesterday. ... Some residents started fires and clashed with police.

Morning Edition introduced a report from Jennifer Ludden with this language:

Lets go directly to Baltimore, this morning. Thats where people threw cinder blocks at police and set stores on fire. They did all that after the funeral for a black man who died in police custody. NPRs Jennifer Ludden is tracking the aftermath of the death of Freddie Gray. Jennifer, whats it like in Baltimore?

LABELS AND WHY ITS WISE TO AVOID THEM

 Immigrants.

 Medical conditions.

 Teenager.

 Victims vs. survivors. (Particularly in cases of sexual assault.)

Update at 9:55 a.m. ET:

We should also avoid saying that Freddie Gray died while in police custody. He had been arrested, so he had been taken into custody. But it was a week after his arrest, and he was in a hospital, when he died. The phrase in police custody calls to mind someone who is in a jail cell, or who is in handcuffs in the back of a police cruiser.

A woman who runs an organization in mainly Kurdish Northern Iraq, where women face threats, is in Washington to receive an award from Vital Voices, a non-profit group that puts a spotlight on women.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

And now let's meet someone who has dedicated her life to promoting women's rights in a troubled part of the world. She will be honored tonight at the Kennedy Center here in Washington by the group Vital Voices. She's an Iraqi woman. Her fight began at home, as NPR's Michele Kelemen found out.

MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Khanim Latif was just about 12 years old when her father forced her 14-year-old sister into marriage. That was a moment that changed her life.

KHANIM LATIF: And when she left the school and get married, I upset - really upset - and give me a strong pain. I have to change something in my house and inside my family. And I don't let myself and other sister, which we have, to be like her.

KELEMEN: She started reading books about women's rights and became an activist not just inside her family but in her community. At age 45, she now runs a nonprofit called ASUDA, which has a shelter and a hotline for women in need.

LATIF: I'm fighting everyone in tradition, religion, conservative groups set up in the first shelter, independent shelter, which is very taboo in this time.

KELEMEN: Khanim Latif is from northern Iraq, a mainly Kurdish area that's often viewed as a fairly moderate part of the country. But she says she's faced a lot of pressure over the years from religious and community leaders as she protects women and girls from honor killings and helps victims of domestic abuse.

LATIF: To be the activist - to be the activist not belong the rich family, not belong the political party, not belong the famous family, it's very difficult. I built myself by myself.

KELEMEN: Her group is now trying to cope with a massive influx of people fleeing ISIS. They are providing psychological care to women and girls who were held captive by the group. The U.S. has been supporting Kurdish fighters who are battling ISIS, and the U.S. is supporting groups like hers, too.

LATIF: Fighting terrorism group like ISIS is not just about fighting this group. It's about how you'll build your society. And we could not do alone. We need the support from the State Department, from the United States.

KELEMEN: Her award from Vital Voices should help her fundraising efforts here in the U.S. It's also bringing her closer to her sister, the one who was forced into child marriage. She says her sister is more traditional and never liked her activism but did offer her congratulations on her award.

LATIF: Yesterday she calling me and she said, I am proud of you. This make me very prideful.

KELEMEN: Her sister is still married to the same man and has seven children. Khanim Latif says she married late in life and now has a 2-year-old daughter. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, Washington.

npr.org,2016-03-05 00:00:00,' An Imaginary Cartoonist Draws A Very Real Homeland,[],"'Charlie Chan:' An Imaginary Cartoonist Draws A Very Real Homeland

The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye feels like Singapore between two covers. The pressure-cooker country  tiny and polyglot, globally competitive and politically repressive  seems to have been poured into this dense book. As if to make it an even more authentic representation of its homeland, Charlie Chan Hock Chye has met with governmental opposition: Singapore's National Arts Council withdrew a grant from author Sonny Liew because of the book's ""sensitive content.""

Liew seems to have been diligent in assembling all this work by a mid-to-late 20th-century artist. He presents artifacts ranging from shabbily printed comics pages held together with yellowed scotch tape to elegant pencil sketches of people and buildings in Charlie's old neighborhood. Charlie's attempts at portraiture and commercial illustration add intriguing facets. Most remarkable, though, is what happens in the comics across a 30-year period. Their style evolves  or, to put it more accurately, bounds ecstatically  from bold, rounded shapes clearly influenced by Astro Boy creator Osamu Tezuka, to perky animal characters owing a debt to Walt Kelly's Pogo, to stringy musculature and hysterical faces out of EC Comics. There are parodies of Winsor McCay's Little Nemo in Slumberland and an appearance by an obnoxious-looking, brightly colored person who, we learn in one of the many footnotes, is popular Singaporean comics character Mr. Kiasu.

And yet the most persistent feeling in this book is one of disappointment, in people and in Singapore itself. Charlie can't make any money from his work; ""unpublished"" is a constant refrain appended to his most innovative strips. The artist deplores the political failure of 1950s Communist leader Lim Chin Siong, who was jailed without trial for years and kicked out of the country. Charlie clearly believes that if circumstances had been different  if, perhaps, the Communists had managed to negotiate the political rapids more cleverly  Lim might not have been sent into exile as a flower seller and the oppressive People's Action Party, headed by Lee Kuan Yew, might not have cemented a six-decade reign. Liew, meanwhile, seems disappointed in his subject. At the end of the book Charlie is poor and unmarried, unable to scrape together the money for an operation for his sick father. His entire life has been sacrificed to a vocation that never rewarded him. Also, he's imaginary.

In fact, there is no Charlie Chan Hock Chye. Liew created him to be the cartoonist he feels Singapore needs. As Liew sees it, that person must be a versatile genius on a par with  though artistically more adaptable than  the Japanese and American greats. They should be someone who's lived through the most turbulent decades of Singaporean history, a creator who channels seditious political opinions into potent, exciting comics.

It's a tall order. So Liew decided to become that man.

His transformation is virtuosic. First, Liew had to make his book look like a real dossier of an artist's work. His results are perfectly believable. Mixed in with the full-page, full-color comics are unfinished pencil sketches and convincingly dog-eared mockups of Dragon, the magazine Charlie is supposed to have tried unsuccessfully to publish in the 1950s. Someone has even sewed and photographed a little stuffed doll of one of the early characters. The portraits  of friends, family, Charlie himself and, significantly, both Lim and Lee  display Liew's high-art chops.

It's his versatility, though, that's really dazzling. Also enjoyable is his ability to acerbically polemicize Singaporean history stretching back to World War II. As Liew tells it, Charlie was quite radical in his sympathies. Most of the comics provide a mordant take on the issues of the day, using perky children and animals to lambast government oppression. Charlie ostensibly drew a strip in the 1950s and 1960s, the Pogo-esque Bukit Chapalang, satirizing the politics of colonial independence and the short-lived union with Malaysia. Only the first half of the strips were published, according to Liew, but even those seem more controversial than the real-life government would have allowed.

Throughout, Liew advances a consistent critique of Singaporean politics. He's deeply dedicated to the insurrectionist legacy of Lim, suggesting the man occupies a kind of opposite pole from Lee. But the fact remains that one is merely an exiled Communist, while the other led Singapore for decades.

That fact brings a sadness  or rather, another layer of sadness  to the book. For all that it brims over with diverse, colorful creations, it's fundamentally about a lack: the absence of an artist who should exist, but was never allowed to. The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye mourns all the creators who have never been permitted to thrive in Singapore. Liew's own existence seems to be evidence of a change, but only partly. The government withdrew its support from his book, but it didn't ban it outright. That's a kind of progress.

toggle caption Dr. P. Marazzi/Science Source

Medicare is going to test new ways to reimburse doctors for medications, in hopes they'll choose less expensive drugs.

The plan would alter Medicare Part B, which pays for medicines administered in doctors offices or outpatient hospital clinics  to eliminate incentives for doctors to use the most expensive drugs.

The changes would have an outsize effect on cancer doctors and clinics. Medicare Part B shelled out about $7.8 billion on cancer drugs in 2014, or 42 percent of its total spending on drugs that year.

The program now reimburses the doctors or clinics for the cost of the medication plus a 6 percent fee. That means doctors and hospitals earn more money when they use pricier drugs.

As it is now, Dr. Patrick Conway, chief medical officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, called the reimbursement structure ""perverse.""

""We've heard from oncologists who feel pressure from their health system to pick higher cost drugs even when they are not appropriate for a patient,"" he said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.

The agency plans to test a reimbursement formula that would pay the cost of the drug, plus a 2.5 percent surcharge and a flat fee of $16.80.

Under the current system, a doctor earns just 60 cents for administering a $10 medication. An equivalent drug that cots $1,000, however, would bring in $60. Under the proposed formula, the cheaper drug in this example would generate a payment of $16.93 and the second one $41.80, according to CMS.



CMS officials say that change would mostly eliminate the incentive to choose a high priced drug over one that may be more appropriate. Medicare Part B spent about $20 billion on outpatient medicines last year.

""We're trying to align the incentives to what's best for patients and doctors,"" Conway said.

The Medicare Part B plan would also reduce or eliminate the share of the drugs' costs that patients have to pay.

Dr. Peter Bach, director of The Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, says research shows doctors prescribe higher priced drugs when they bring in more profit.

""It is refreshing to see Medicare move towards an experiment where they pay for drugs using a flat fee reimbursement, where what doctors and hospitals make is related to giving the drug, not how much it costs,"" Bach said in a statement to Shots.

But other cancer doctors aren't so thrilled.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology opposes the CMS proposal. The proposal could have a major effect on oncologists because many cancer patients receive their chemotherapy treatments in doctors offices or clinics.

""It is inappropriate for CMS to manipulate choice of treatment for cancer patients using heavy-handed reimbursement techniques,"" said ASCO CEO Allen Lichter in a statement posted on the physician group's website.

ASCO, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association and about 100 other physician and advocacy groups sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell last week opposing the payment changes.

""We believe that this type of initiative, implemented without sufficient stakeholder input, will adversely affect the care and treatment of Medicare patients with complex conditions,"" the letter said.

The agency plans to field test the new reimbursement formula, as well as a handful of others ideas, in different regions of the country starting later this year. CMS will then compare the results to determine which changes are effective at reducing drug spending.

CMS is also planning to test a handful of so-called value-based pricing ideas. The first would pay for drugs according to how well they work.

For example, if a cancer medication is very effective in eliminating a specific tumor, but is also used on a second, different condition with less success, Medicare will pay less when it is used for the second condition than the first. Sloan Kettering's Bach, who served as an adviser to CMS on cancer policy in 2005 and 2006, argued for varying payments for drugs this way in a 2014 paper published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association. The approach is called indication-based pricing.

The agency also plans to work with drugmakers to link prices to patient outcomes, perhaps paying less for medications when patients end up being admitted to a hospital.

Private insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been testing similar ideas.

Cigna last month said it had agreed with drugmaker Novartis on a pay-for-performance deal for the heart failure drug Entresto. Under the agreement, Cigna will pay less if patients taking the medication are hospitalized for heart failure.

And Express Scripts, the biggest manager of pharmacy benefits, says it's working with cancer drug manufacturers to pay indication-based prices that tie cost to how well the drugs perform.

The CMS proposal is open for public comment until May 9. Conway said the field tests will begin after the comment period is complete.",[]

i toggle caption Geoff Robins/AFP/Getty Images Geoff Robins/AFP/Getty Images

Tonight the two Democratic candidates  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders  meet in Miami for a debate.

Before Tuesday night, the debate was looking like an unimportant afterthought to a race that could have been all wrapped up. But not anymore, after Sanders' stunningly unexpected win in Michigan last night.

Here are three things to watch:

1. Delegates or momentum?

Hillary Clinton's campaign says all that matters is delegates and by that measure she succeeded Tuesday night  increasing her delegate lead over Bernie Sanders. But her loss to Sanders exposed troubling weaknesses for Clinton which she needs to address tonight.

How will she try to woo independents (which she lost) and white working class voters (which she almost lost)?

2. Sanders' new lease on life

Just when pundits were getting ready to call him irrelevant, Sanders is now set up nicely for Ohio  another big Rust Belt state that votes next Tuesday.

Tonight in Miami, will he raise the electability question: If Clinton lost Michigan to a Democratic populist in March, why wouldn't she lose Michigan to a Republican populist (Donald Trump) in November?

3. The enthusiasm gap

Republicans keep on posting high turnout levels. Democratic turnout is below 2008 levels.

In addition, the news media are inclined to cover a rambling 45-minute infomercial by Trump  billed as a presidential style news conference  instead of speeches by the other candidates.

If Trump is the nominee and continues to drive ratings, the Democrats might be gasping for airtime this fall.",[]

i LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR

The Internet has not killed the book.

For film critic David Denby, this wasn't immediately obvious. He would watch young people hunched over their phones  on the subway, in coffee shops, walking down the street  and wonder: Are kids still learning to read books?

Denby, who is best known for his work in The New Yorker, went back to high school to find out. He describes his experience in Lit Up: One Reporter. Three Schools. Twenty-Four Books That Can Change Lives.

He followed three high school English classes for a full year: a 10th-grade class at The Beacon School in Manhattan, Mamaroneck High School near New York City and James Hillhouse High School in New Haven, Conn.

Seated on a table in the back of a New York classroom  pushing copies of Shakespeare and Herman Hesse out of the way to make space for himself Denby learned that schools can absolutely still teach kids to love literature.

I asked him to talk about some of his discoveries. Here's our conversation, edited for length:

Why did you only look at three schools, and why did you look at the students in those schools so intensely?

I dislike this American metric prejudice whereby no assertion can be considered of any value unless it's backed up with statistics, surveys, probabilities. Particularly in the education world.

We're talking about young people becoming adults. Becoming themselves. Becoming souls. Becoming conscious. And I don't see how that's measurable.

And I was sick of failure.

I was sick of almost the pornographic reveling in American ineptitude. I wanted to see something that worked.

I didn't want to write a handbook for teachers. I didn't want to write a survey. I wanted to follow one organic development of a class.

I chose Beacon because someone told me about the school. I found that this was a very interesting class because this guy, Sean Leon, was asking students questions that challenged them, I don't know how else to put it, existentially. I mean, they were reading Dostoyevsky and Herman Hesse and Vonnegut, and Faulkner and Hawthorne and so on.

The books that they read tended, with his help, to focus attention to these questions: Who are you? Why do you live? Where are you going? What are you doing?

You know, if you take a typically sarcastic, joking, self-deprecating, media-hip American teenager and scratch him two or three times, you'll find this sort of earnestly questing person underneath. That's what he did.

So, not every school is Beacon ...

Hillhouse is a large inner-city school ... a very different environment.

The kids had strength of feeling and perception. What they weren't, was eager readers.

At the beginning of the year, these were 15- and 16-year-olds, African-American kids, they weren't willing to do the reading at all. The teacher would give them an assignment and they would come in the next day and be blank about it. They couldn't see, particularly the boys, the point of reading in English class. What was it going to do for them?

So that was what Jessica Zylenski, the teacher [at Hillhouse], was trying to engage with and, if necessary, break down.

It's funny to me because, you explicitly said that your book is not a handbook. But the Hillhouse chapters, they do tend to focus on techniques that teachers might use.

The issue always was: How do you get them started?

They read To Kill A Mockingbird, which may seem an odd choice. In other words, they read about poor white people in Alabama in 1930. She wanted them, however, to go from those lives to their own life. From how people lived then to how they lived in New Haven in the 21st century.

So initially they were unwilling to read and they started reading in class together, and then she started moving them to other things. They tried a little Shakespeare. A little Melville. They loved stories by Vonnegut and Hemingway. By the end of the year, they were choosing among four books. And she plunged them into difficult and tragic material because that was what seemed real to them.

I want to pivot back to Sean Leon's class. He always seems to see them right where they are and get them where they need to go.

Well, I know I could never be a teacher.

To be a great teacher, you have to be in touch with what 15 or 20 or, in Sean Leon's case, 32 teenagers are feeling at any one moment.

He has that sixth or seventh sense of where the kids are and how far he can push them. He would plunge into a text, play them off against each other. He never just sat down, laid down the law.

He would pull them out of their defensiveness and get them to perform. Jump from the text and to bring it right into the center of their lives.

I am always bothered by people saying, ""Technology is the worst thing that could happen to the world."" But that's not what you do here.

Exactly. I mean, who am I to say that only literature matters and only books matter? I spent 45 years as a movie critic.

I am addicted to email. I use Facebook and so on. I'm on the Web for all sorts of information. But I also love best to read, and I feel I have to pull back.

He [teacher Sean Leon] was saying you've got to have yourself. You've got to have your family. You've got to have conversation. Movies are fine. The Internet is incredibly useful. But don't think you're going to find yourself there. You may find certain reflections of yourself, but you cannot find your soul there.

In the book, Leon's students wind up doing a pretty good analysis of the hypocrisy of the show Teen Mom. It's almost like he's saying: ""It's fine to be watching TV, but think critically about it.""

I mean, it's an enormously powerful critical tool, reading literature and addressing the world. It's not simple lessons, of course. And it doesn't happen overnight. It's incremental. It happens over your entire life.

Iran's military tested two ballistic missiles Wednesday, and an Iranian officer says the missiles are designed to reach Israel, according to an Iranian news agency. Iran has conducted a number of other ballistic missile tests this week.

The tests, which come after Iran won sanctions relief in January by curbing its nuclear program, seem to be ""aimed at demonstrating that Iran will push forward with its ballistic program,"" The Associated Press reports.

NPR's Peter Kenyon tells our Newscast unit that ""the tests may violate a U.N. Security Council resolution barring Iran from test-firing missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons."" Here's more from Peter:

""Iran says its missiles aren't designed for nuclear weapons. The U.S. says Iran's missile program is not part of last year's nuclear agreement, but Iran has warned that any new sanctions could mean an end to the deal.""

Iran's Press TV has video of the ballistic missile launch on its website. You can watch it here.

As Reuters reports, ""the missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran."" Additionally, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ""maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East.""

Iran denies that this test was ""provocative,"" according to the wire service.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest told journalists that the reported missile launches underscore the importance of the nuclear deal with Iran. ""Iran is working aggressively to try to enhance their ballistic missile capability, and preventing them from being able to nuclearize their missiles is  is obviously important to our national security here in the United States,"" he says.

Earnest adds that it ""would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days.""

NPR's Michele Kelemen says the State Department and the White House are taking a ""cautious line"" on the missile test. The State Department says ""Secretary of State John Kerry raised this in a phone call with his Iranian counterpart,"" Michele reports.

Hillary Clinton took a harder line than the current administration. She said in a statement that Iran's ""blatant violation"" of the Security Council resolution should have ""consequences."" She adds: ""Iran should face sanctions for these activities, and the international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats toward Israel will not be tolerated.""",[]

Her latest album is Abbar el Hamada (""Across the Hamada"")  Hamada is the word that Saharawi people use to describe the rocky desert landscape along the Western Sahara where tens of thousands of refugees are now stranded.

Tritha Electric

Tritha Sinha, the driving force behind the punk band Tritha Electric, grew up in Kolkata, India, and paid her way through college by singing in Bollywood films. Her Paris- and New Delhi-based band blends Indian classical and folk melodies with '70s-style psychedelic and punk music.

And she's all about girl power. Her latest album, called Pagli (""crazy lady"" in Bengali), tells the story of a woman who feels oppressed by tradition and finds liberation by breaking patriarchal rules.

Muthoni Ndonga aka Muthoni the Drummer Queen aka The Bauss Lady is a big deal in the Kenyan music scene. She's the CEO and founder of a wildly popular monthly music series, Blankets and Wine, which puts on shows in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

The bio page on her website describes her as a ""living breathing singer of the hero variety,"" and I'd have to agree. Her funky, hip-hop sound features heavily in Nairobi's dance clubs, while her lyrics  in English and Swahili  address issues of social justice and poverty.

In the case of Jeff Buckley, who died at age 30 in 1997 after only a few years of recorded output, the phenomenon is even more pronounced: Because the years leading up to his death have been so picked over, vault-diggers have had to delve ever further into the past, all the way back to early, developmental recordings like 2002's Songs To No One, a batch of songs he'd recorded with Gary Lucas in 1991 and '92. To hear some of Buckley's oldest known recordings now is to watch an already ethereal musician age in reverse.

You And I collects 10 of his demos, which were recorded in February 1993, shortly after he'd signed to his label. For more than 20 years, they sat forgotten in the vaults  and, more to the point, were never bootlegged or otherwise circulated. Newly unearthed, they showcase a late-blooming 26-year-old artist who's still finding and harnessing his voice: learning how to manipulate its gale-force power, learning when and whether to hold back, and learning how to fully translate his influences into a sound of his own.

Most of these songs are covers, and the artists represented help lay out the contours of Buckley's own style: Two of the best (""I Know It's Over,"" ""The Boy With The Thorn In His Side"") are by The Smiths, while Bob Dylan, Sly & The Family Stone, Bukka White and Led Zeppelin help round out a set that also includes ""Calling You"" (written by Bob Telson and recorded by Jevetta Steele) and ""Don't Let The Sun Catch You Cryin'"" (popularized by Louis Jordan, Ray Charles and others). Other anthologies have captured Buckley's love of even clearer influences on his voice  Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Nina Simone, et al  but the eight covers here still help provide a sense of where his rock and pop influences dovetailed with his love of blues and jazz. (Buckley rarely touched the catalog of his long-dead father, Tim Buckley, whom he famously resembled in both appearance and sound.)

Then there are the two originals: ""Grace,"" written with Lucas, would become one of Jeff Buckley's signature songs, while ""Dream Of You And I"" jots down the barest framework for what would become ""You And I."" That's where this collection is most illuminative. When the final version of ""You And I"" was released posthumously on 1998's Sketches For My Sweetheart The Drunk, it had fleshed out the ideas and sounds explored here  but it was still technically unfinished, which means Buckley spent roughly four years translating an evocative moment from a barely remembered dream into something he still couldn't quite embrace.

That's part of why collections such as this hold so much value: They show how songs breathe and evolve, and help explain how their creation can unfold over the course of many years. Bob Dylan's many archival sets showcase the same phenomenon all the time, but unlike Dylan, Buckley was anything but prolific as a songwriter; he interpreted more songs than he wrote. ""Dream Of You And I"" demonstrates how difficult it is to transform a few hauntingly sung words (""You and I, you and I, you and I / All for you"") into a finished work, while also capturing a few compelling moments of conversation wherein he lays out the song's meaning.

Like so much of Jeff Buckley's posthumous output  nearly 20 years' worth, at this point  You And I was never meant to be heard by the public. Under ordinary circumstances, it'd be little more than a curiosity, trotted out for obsessives only. But as it is, it's another crucial piece of a puzzle that, by definition, can never feel complete.",[]

Alfredo Rodriguez left Cuba for the United States seven years ago. The classically-trained pianist and composer has been mentored and produced by music legend Quincy Jones.

Leaving Cuba opened up the world to Alfredo Rodriguez, and globalism is most of what you hear on his new album, Tocororo. There's flamenco and tango and Bach; there's also an international cast of musicians, most enchantingly the Indian singer Ganavya, who soars over Rodriguez's piano trio on the title track.

What distinguishes Rodriguez's globalism is his ability to both compose and perform into a kind of ecstasy. Like most Cuban musicians, he can handle polyrhythms, and he uses them like a kaleidoscope, combining and shifting meters to bring new reflections and moods to his music.

YouTube

When Rodriguez does look back to Cuba on this album, it's with songs that are not so familiar abroad. The 1990s hit ""Sabanas Blancas"" is a love song to Havana and the emblematic white sheets that hang on its balconies. In Rodriguez's inventive arrangement, his thumping piano groove repeats under the duo Ibeyi's Afro-Cuban vocals.

The music develops parallel to the song's lyrics, gaining force and dimension verse by verse. Rodriguez isn't nostalgically dreaming about home here; he wants to create a musical ritual powerful enough to conjure Havana right there in the recording studio.

Tocororo is equal parts sophistication and sincerity. It's the sound of a prodigiously talented Cuban embracing the wider world of music. Best of all, the album resonates with the possibility of all the other new music we'll discover as Cuba itself opens up to the world.",[]

Sir George Martin, the music producer who signed the Beatles to a recording contract in 1962 and was their intimate collaborator as they together transformed popular music, died Tuesday at the age of 90.

Martin's death was confirmed by Adam Sharp, his manager in the U.K. In a statement, Sharp said:

Sir George Martin passed away peacefully at home yesterday evening, Tuesday March 8th. The family would like to thank everyone for their thoughts, prayers and messages of support.

Martin was often referred to as the ""Fifth Beatle."" He scoffed, but the band wouldn't have been the Beatles we know without him.

Martin's 1979 memoir (co-authored with Jeremy Hornsby) was titled All You Need Is Ears  but his ears, and his instincts as a music producer, were extraordinary.

A classically trained composer, George Martin began to work for the British record label EMI's imprint Parlophone Records in 1950, overseeing classical recordings as well as comedy records by the likes of Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Bernard Cribbins.

By 1962, when Cribbins' song ""Right Said Fred"" became a hit in the U.K., George Martin was running Parlophone Records and looking to sign up a rock 'n' roll band. The Beatles auditioned for him in June of 1962.

In a 2011 BBC interview, Martin said: ""They had this wonderful charisma. They made you feel good to be with them. And I thought their music was rubbish.""

Martin signed the Beatles anyway, and came to love their songs. For the rest of the 1960s, he was their closest collaborator, producing almost all of the band's music, playing piano with them, writing their orchestral arrangements and figuring out how to turn John Lennon and Paul McCartney's wilder ideas into records.

In 2011, Martin described how he'd produced one of Lennon's signature songs:

""There was one time on 'Rain' when I decided to play around with tapes, and I took John's voice off as a separate item and put it on a quarter-inch tape and turned it back to front and slid it around a bit and then put it in on the end of the song. And I played it to John when he came back and he said, 'That's gear! What is it?' And I said, 'It's you!' And I explained to him what I'd done. And from that moment he wanted everything backward.""

When he wasn't in the studio with the Beatles, George Martin produced records by British pop acts like Cilla Black, Gerry and the Pacemakers and Shirley Bassey.

In 1977, while visiting the West Indies, Martin fell in love with the island of Montserrat. He built a recording complex for his company AIR Studios there with the money he'd made producing post-Beatles hits like the band America's ""Sister Golden Hair.""

AIR Studios Montserrat was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and Martin gradually retired from recording as hearing loss robbed him of his golden ears. His final hit song was the best-selling single of all time: a year after being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, he produced Elton John's ""Candle in the Wind 1997.""

""As a whole, I've had a wonderful life,"" Martin told the BBC in 1995. ""I've met the most wonderful people, worked with the greatest of artists. I'm very fortunate. I've got no gripes at all.""",[]

i Katherine Du/NPR Katherine Du/NPR

Miss Manners and skilled prep cooks should be pleased: Our early human ancestors likely mastered the art of chopping and slicing more than 2 million years ago. Not only did this yield daintier pieces of meat and vegetables that were much easier to digest raw, with less chewing  it also helped us along the road to becoming modern humans, researchers reported Wednesday.

And our ancestors picked up these skills at least 1.5 million years before cooking took off as a common way to prepare food, the researchers say.

Chewing, it turns out, takes a lot of time and energy, say Katherine Zink and Daniel Lieberman, evolutionary biologists at Harvard University. They recently set about measuring precisely how much effort is required to chew raw food, and to what degree simple stone tools might have eased the toil.

""Every time I go out to dinner, I watch people chew,"" Lieberman tells us. ""And sometimes, I actually count how many times they chew.""

toggle caption John Reader/Science Source

It's not just a hobby. Lieberman's interest gets to some basic questions of how humans evolved.

Scientists have long known that Homo erectus, an ancestor of modern humans who lived about 2 million years ago, had already evolved to have a bigger body and brain than earlier hominins, and would have needed much more daily energy to survive. But the jaw and teeth of H. erectus were much like ours today  significantly smaller and less powerful than those of Australopithecus afarensis, or other hominins of earlier epochs.

A diet that included cooked meat would have provided that ready energy without the need for sharp canines and big grinders. But the research evidence is pretty clear that cooking didn't become common until about 500,000 years ago, Lieberman says. So, how did H. erectus get the needed calories?

To test a long-held hypothesis that simple food processing might be the answer, Zink and Lieberman invited some Harvard colleagues to what Zink calls ""a lab cafe,"" and served them small portions of carrots, beets, jewel yams and goat meat. The food was served variously as roasted or raw; sliced, pounded or left in hunks.

""If I were to give you raw goat,"" Lieberman says, ""you'd chew, and nothing would happen."" Like a lot of wild game, goat meat tends to be stringy, he says. Chewing a big piece makes it more elastic, but it doesn't readily break into pieces.

""But if you cut goat into smaller pieces,"" he says, ""your ability to chew it would improved dramatically.""

All the volunteers (14 for the vegetables and just 10 for the goat meat) wore a number of small sensors pasted to their faces, to detect and count contractions of various muscle fibers as they chewed the bite of food to the point of swallowing. The scientists then translated those contractions into a measure of muscular effort, and also checked to see how well the food was broken up.

Their results, published in the journal Nature, suggest that when eating a diet made up of one-third meat, if early humans pounded the vegetables before eating them, and sliced the meat, they would need to chew 17 percent less often and 26 percent less forcefully than if they started with larger slabs of the food. Every little flex of the jaw and grinding of the teeth adds up: Over the course of a year, Lieberman says, simply having a sharp stone to slice meat would reduce the number of ""chews"" needed by 2.5 million.

""I think it's amazing,"" he says, ""to think that the simple stone tool could have a massive effect on how effectively we chew a piece of meat.""

It's possible, he and Zink think, that the benefits of meat-eating and food processing favored the transition to smaller teeth and jaws.

But it seems more likely, they write in their study, that tool use and meat-eating simply reduced the evolutionary pressure to have big, powerful jaws and sharp teeth, ""thus permitting selection to decrease facial and dental size for other functions, such as speech production, locomotion, thermoregulation, or, perhaps even changes in the size and shape of the brain.""

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Voters delivered a surprise last night. Michigan gave a Democratic primary win to Bernie Sanders.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

He narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton despite polls that showed him far behind. That was just one result on a night when Clinton also won Mississippi, not to mention Republican wins for Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.

INSKEEP: Let's focus for this moment on the Democrats. Margie Omero is with us again. She's a Democratic pollster. And she's on the line. Welcome back to the program.

MARGIE OMERO: Good morning, thanks for having me.

GREENE: And also on the line is John Feehery, who has served as a spokesman for leading Republican lawmakers. John, good morning to you.

JOHN FEEHERY: Good morning.

GREENE: Let me ask you both the same question, if I can. We've sort of enjoyed doing this on nights after voting to try and capture what happened. Margie, can you sum up the Democratic results last night in one sentence?

OMERO: Well, are we surprised by Sanders' gain, or are we surprised more by the polling? Is it more of a polling revolution that we may need to have? And if we look at the reason why, I think one reason could be trade. That certainly came out in exit polls and seems to have been an issue in the last few days before voting.

GREENE: All right. A long sentence, but we'll let you go with that. We look forward to exploring that more. John, what about you?

FEEHERY: Well, I think that it's Hillary Clinton's surprising weakness among African Americans in Michigan and the fact that Sanders had this upset victory. I think it's shocking.

INSKEEP: OK. We'll expand on those sentences in a moment. First, let's hear the candidates and some of their advisers. NPR's Tamara Keith is covering the campaign.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: If elections are about expectations and momentum, then Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders won the night last night. Hillary Clinton won the primary as expected in Mississippi by an overwhelming margin. But Michigan was the biggest prize. And polls leading into the primary had Clinton up by double digits. That's not how it turned out, not even close.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BERNIE SANDERS: I just want to take this opportunity to thank the people of Michigan, who kind of repudiated the polls that had us 20, 25 points down a few days ago.

KEITH: That was Bernie Sanders at almost 11 o'clock last night. He had given a speech hours earlier. But he was back to make a statement after it was clear voters in Michigan were making a statement of their own.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SANDERS: What tonight means is that the Bernie Sanders campaign, the people's - the revolution - the people's revolution that we are talking about, the political revolution that we are talking about is strong in every part of the country.

KEITH: In the final tally, Sanders won Michigan by 2 percentage points, a margin of about 20,000 votes out of a million cast. Exit polls indicate Sanders' message about international trade deals hurting American workers resonated with Michigan voters.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SANDERS: And frankly, we believe that our strongest areas are yet to happen.

KEITH: Sanders' campaign sent out a fundraising email celebrating the win and asking his supporters to pitch in just a little bit more. If history is a guide, this win will help Sanders raise millions of dollars in a matter of hours. And that money will help him compete and run TV ads in the next states on the election calendar - Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri and Ohio.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you so much. Hello, Cleveland. Hello, Ohio.

KEITH: Long before the results were in, Hillary Clinton, her campaign sensing Michigan wasn't going their way, spoke to supporters in Cleveland.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CLINTON: This will be a busy week here in Ohio.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And this campaign is about building a future where every American can live up to his or her full potential.

KEITH: For the Clinton campaign, losing to Sanders in Michigan is a speed bump, one they certainly would rather have avoided. But as Clinton's team sees it, this race isn't about momentum or expectations or even about wins. It's about delegates. And in that respect, Clinton didn't actually lose last night. She pulled further ahead. With her 66-point win in Mississippi and her close second in Michigan, she ended the night winning more pledged delegates than Sanders. As she spoke last night, it was clear that Clinton has one eye on Sanders but the other on Donald Trump.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CLINTON: Now, running for president shouldn't be about delivering insults. It should be about delivering results for the American people.

KEITH: The delegate math remains in Clinton's favor. But Sanders' campaign adviser, Tad Devine, says this is a marathon not a sprint. He described the campaign strategy over the weekend to Politico reporter Glenn Thrush in his podcast called ""Off Message.""

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, ""OFF MESSAGE"")

TAD DEVINE: We're going to try to beat her in pledged delegates. We think we've got until the end of the process to do that. We think we have - it's going to be hard. It's going to be tough. We know we have to win to get it done. But we think we can.

KEITH: And after their stunning come-from-behind win in Michigan, it's a whole lot harder to tell them they can't.

GREENE: All right. That's our colleague Tamara Keith reporting on the Democratic results last night. We were listening here with Republican consultant John Feehery and Democratic pollster Margie Omero. And, Margie, let me start with you. You said a couple things before we started listening to that piece. You suggested this was a polling revolution in Michigan. You also brought up the issue of trade. I mean, what are Michigan Democratic voters saying here?

OMERO: Well, a majority of Michigan primary voters said in the exit polls that they think that trade can hurt U.S. jobs. And you saw that come out in the last Democratic debate. And actually, there's been some really great analysis about website FiveThirtyEight, where that's actually - their views on trade are one of the big differentiators between Clinton voters and Sanders voters. I was surprised to see trade be so salient, frankly. It's something that's pretty complicated and dense and different for every voter and how they experience it. But it may be important, particularly in the Midwest. And this may - the results from last night may portend what we are going to see next week in some of the other contests.

INSKEEP: John Feehery, we had an economist on the program yesterday who pointed out that this is a major dividing issue in both political parties. The elites of each party may be in one place. Their voters may be in another place.

FEEHERY: Yeah, the interesting thing is Trump is kind of the Bernie Sanders of the Republican Party. And that could be a vulnerability for Hillary if Trump gets the nomination. Now, listen, I think Hillary is still going to get the nomination. She's got the superdelegates. She's going to eek this out. But it's not going to be winning pretty. It's going to be winning ugly, as Tad Devine kind of said - acknowledged. And the fact is that trade has become a big issue for both parties. And in the upper Midwest, in Illinois, where I'm from, Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan, you know, this is becoming a big issue for both parties. And I think both parties are going to take heat. I think the other problem for Hillary is she is the political establishment. And this seems to be an antiestablishment year in both parties.

GREENE: John, can I just ask you? You suggested that Hillary Clinton was seeing some weakness among African-American voters. Now, she seemed to do very well with black voters in Mississippi. And in Michigan, I mean, she certainly got a sizable amount of their support. What numbers are you looking at?

FEEHERY: What I was kind of - she didn't perform as well as people thought in Michigan. I think to Margie's point, the polls show that she was going to win Michigan easily. And she didn't get the turnout. And that's - I think Margie is exactly right. She did a trade in Michigan. But a little bit less of an issue in Mississippi, where obviously in the states in the South she's killing it. But in the upper Midwest, it's a real vulnerability. And that actually plays well for Republicans because you think about - Republicans are going to win the South. It's in the upper Midwest where they're going to have problems. And if Trump could be the nominee, that could present some problems for Hillary.

INSKEEP: You also have a fight over working-class voters, white voters particularly. Donald Trump has drawn a lot of of them and gotten a lot of attention. Bernie Sanders has fairly explicitly sought to attract working-class white voters back to the Democratic Party. What do these results suggest about how he's doing? Either of you...

FEEHERY: I think he's doing very well. And I think that - it's interesting that both Bernie and Trump are going for those same voters. And I think that they're doing better than expected in both parties. And it's been a fascinating fight.

INSKEEP: Margie Omero, do you think - I mean, this has been a subject of much debate. Do you think the Sanders voter is similar to the Trump voter? Or are we just kind of conflating two different movements here?

OMERO: You know, I cringe when I hear comparisons between Trump and Sanders. I mean, it's true that both, in the exit polls, show that voters who are particularly angry at the system, are angry at government, are more likely to vote for Sanders. And the Republican Party, they're more likely to vote for Trump. Trump is using just hateful language. I think it's something that Republicans should worry about. I think we should all be worrying about him becoming a nominee and what that means for our political process. Meanwhile, I don't think the same is true. Obviously, the same is not true for Sanders. And Democratic primary voters are much happier with either candidates Clinton or Sanders as their nominee. You don't see that in the Republican Party. There's a lot less satisfaction with any of the candidates being the nominee.

GREENE: Just about a minute left to talk to you both. Margie, let me just start with you. Something we've noticed, a lot of people have noticed. Turnout, much higher on the Republican side in a lot of states than on the Democratic side - is that a sign of more Republican excitement about this election? And are you worried about that?

OMERO: I'm not worried about that. I mean, one, when people make those comparisons, they compare Democratic turnout to 2008. It's higher than many other primaries. And 2008 was obviously different. It was historic for a variety of reasons. Also, the scene is competitive in nearly every state. And that obviously boosts turnout. And also, I think you're going to have a lot of voters who, you know - you have new voters coming on both sides. I don't think that having slightly new Republican voters and elevated turnout in Republican primaries means that they're going to be more competitive in the general. You have candidates on the Republican side who are incredibly unpopular nationwide.

INSKEEP: John Feehery, you've about 10 seconds here on turnout.

FEEHERY: I think the turnout is good for Republicans. The question is the turnout for which candidate? And that's the thing that's troubling. I think Margie's right - Trump and Cruz both trouble, I mean, to be honest with you.

INSKEEP: OK. Thanks very much to you both. Democratic pollster Margie Omero joined us this morning. Thank you very much.

OMERO: Thank you.

INSKEEP: Also, Republican strategist John Feehery, thanks to you.

FEEHERY: All right, thank you.

GREENE: Thank you both.

Steve Inskeep talks to Univision anchor Jorge Ramos about his book, Take A Stand: Lessons From Rebels. Ramos will be one of the moderators at Wednesday's Washington Post-Univision Democratic debate.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Let's meet a journalist who sometimes makes himself part of the story. He's Jorge Ramos. He's an anchor for the Spanish-language network Univision. At a press conference last year, Ramos stood to challenge Donald Trump on his plan to deport millions of immigrants who were here illegally. Trump first refused to call on Ramos and then had security guards remove him.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. Sit down. You weren't called. Sit down. Sit down.

JORGE RAMOS: I have the right to ask a question.

TRUMP: Go back to Univision.

RAMOS: It's the first time in 30 years as a journalist in the United States in which I'd been ejected from a press conference for asking a question. The only other time in which I'd been prevented from asking a question was with Fidel Castro.

INSKEEP: Jorge Ramos was eventually allowed back in at the urging of other reporters. He asked several questions although Trump gave no ground. Early this year Ramos made headlines again. He was the one who interviewed former Mexican President Vicente Fox about Trump's claim that he will make Mexico pay for a great wall on the border. Fox replied...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

VICENTE FOX: I'm not going to pay for that [expletive] wall. He should pay for it. He's got the money.

INSKEEP: Tonight Jorge Ramos is in the spotlight once again. He will moderate a debate among Democrats Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton - a race that once again is intensely interesting. Ramos has interviewed candidates, presidents and other world leaders for decades now. He's about to publish a book about his experience and his view of journalism. It is called ""Take A Stand.""

Do you think of yourself as an advocacy journalist? Is that the right phrase for what you do?

RAMOS: I have been asking if I'm an activist or a journalist. And my answer is very simple. I'm just a journalist who asks questions. The difference is that I'm completely convinced that there are few moments, important moments, in which you have to take a stand as a journalist. When it comes to racism, discrimination, corruption, public lies, dictatorships and human rights, you have to take a stand as a reporter because I think our responsibility as journalist is to confront those who are abusing power. You know, I've been reading a lot about neutrality. Elie Wiesel, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, he says, we must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. In other words, as journalist, I'm completely convinced we have to take a stand sometimes.

INSKEEP: You work through in this book an account of a time that you believed that President Obama was wrong and in fact that you feel he broke a promise that he made in an interview with you regarding immigration reform. What did he say?

RAMOS: He was a candidate 2008. And he said, you know, I cannot promise that I'll propose immigration reform during the first 100 days, but I can do that within one year. And everybody in the Hispanic community call that la promesa de Obama, Obama's promise. And he just didn't keep his word.

INSKEEP: Well, this is an interesting part of this story, though. You assert that that would have made a difference, that had he gone ahead and proposed immigration reform early in his first term that it would have passed. Do you really believe that?

RAMOS: Not only do I believe that, it was so easy to understand. The Senate was controlled by the Democrats. The House was controlled by the Democrats. And they had all the votes. And they waited and waited and waited. If he really didn't mean that he was going to propose immigration reform during his first year in office then he shouldn't have promised that.

INSKEEP: How do you think it has affected your outlook on life that you are one of this very small group of people who can call up almost anybody and talk with them?

RAMOS: You know, I became a journalist - one of the reasons why I became a journalist was because I wanted to be able to talk to the people who are changing the world. And I do learn from powerful people. On the other hand, Oriana Fallaci, the Italian journalist who died recently...

INSKEEP: Right.

RAMOS: He used to say that interviews were a war and that sometimes the interview would win and sometimes the interviewer would win.

INSKEEP: Can you think of an interview where you feel like the interviewee won?

RAMOS: Oh, many times, (laughter) many times. I don't think I win most interviews. For instance, with Fidel Castro, I only spoke with him one minute and three seconds. But I think he won because I couldn't get anything from him. With the former president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, it happened exactly the same thing. And as a Mexican, for me it is incredibly frustrating to talk to the president of Mexico - former presidents of Mexico - because I can't get to them. It is very difficult. On the other hand - I know you'll find this surprising - but it is so refreshing to talk to American presidents because they are much more open than Latin American presidents.

INSKEEP: How many American presidents have you spoken with?

RAMOS: Every U.S. president since George Bush Sr. I have been able to...

INSKEEP: And you found them all relatively open to your questions?

RAMOS: Not relatively open - much more open than to talk to Latin American dictators or Latin American presidents. When you talk to a Latin American president, they make you feel so tiny right from the beginning, right from the moment when they shake your hands. Once I - I'm not going to say exactly in which country - but I asked to go to the bathroom right before the interview and a general followed me all the way to the bathroom...

INSKEEP: (Laughter).

RAMOS: ...And waited outside. But they make you feel you really have no power. And when you have 80 journalists who have been killed in Mexico, for instance, in the last decade, yeah, you realize how lucky we are here in the United States in which you can go to the White House, talk to the president and go back to your house. And then you can take a bike ride and go to the supermarket and no one is going to kill you. No one is going to do anything against you. That's a huge difference.

INSKEEP: So as we're talking, you are preparing for a debate between two would-be presidents - Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.

RAMOS: Right.

INSKEEP: Don't give away your specific questions here. I'm not asking that. But what is the essence of what you want to know from each of those two?

RAMOS: You want to know who they really are and what they believe in. So what I'm going to try to do tonight is to put aside some of the statements that they've said and try to get to know the real candidate, the real person, the person who is behind the candidate, the person who might become the president of the United States. And it's not easy.

INSKEEP: Meaning you might not get them to agree with you but you want to push them to the point were they have to level with you about something?

RAMOS: Exactly, and then if we talk tomorrow and I was not able to put them on the defensive then I didn't do my job.

INSKEEP: Jorge Ramos is the author of ""Take A Stand"" and also of course a longtime anchor for Univision. Thank you very much.

RAMOS: Thank you.

INSKEEP: Jorge Ramos is also moderating tonight's Democratic debate between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.

As we approach the post-2000s future we'd originally imagined for ourselves in pop culture  hoverboards, city-obliterating smog, artificial intelligence, Martian exploration  gatekeepers and storytellers give these once-radical predictions continued life beyond current reality. In Perturbator, James Kent's retro-futurism is violent and surreal, but fully inhabited in his barrage of synths, which help conjure a dark urban future that's as sleek as a lightcycle and as menacing as a machine-gun arm. He says his latest album, The Uncanny Valley, was inspired by the '70s Italian horror film Suspira and the Japanese manga/anime classics Ghost In The Shell and Akira.

Named for the dystopian city in Akira, ""Neo Tokyo"" opens the album in typical Perturbator fashion: Heavy cyberpunk synths deliver savage four-on-the-floors with soaring Gothic melodies. This is where Kent excels, for sure, but here, his sense of texture and composition gives more weight to the finer details. Crank the bass and there's something truly disorienting about those subs, which in lesser hands might just be noise. After a glitching break, a tonal shift occurs that breaks up the darkness for just the briefest moment before giving way to cacophonous strings. Kent's melody is truly woven into ""Neo Tokyo"" in a way he hasn't attempted before, showing the contrast of its shimmering beauty against an industrial wasteland.

Steve Inskeep talks to Univision anchor Jorge Ramos about his book, Take A Stand: Lessons From Rebels. Ramos will be one of the moderators at Wednesday's Washington Post-Univision Democratic debate.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Let's meet a journalist who sometimes makes himself part of the story. He's Jorge Ramos. He's an anchor for the Spanish-language network Univision. At a press conference last year, Ramos stood to challenge Donald Trump on his plan to deport millions of immigrants who were here illegally. Trump first refused to call on Ramos and then had security guards remove him.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. Sit down. You weren't called. Sit down. Sit down.

JORGE RAMOS: I have the right to ask a question.

TRUMP: Go back to Univision.

RAMOS: It's the first time in 30 years as a journalist in the United States in which I'd been ejected from a press conference for asking a question. The only other time in which I'd been prevented from asking a question was with Fidel Castro.

INSKEEP: Jorge Ramos was eventually allowed back in at the urging of other reporters. He asked several questions although Trump gave no ground. Early this year Ramos made headlines again. He was the one who interviewed former Mexican President Vicente Fox about Trump's claim that he will make Mexico pay for a great wall on the border. Fox replied...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

VICENTE FOX: I'm not going to pay for that [expletive] wall. He should pay for it. He's got the money.

INSKEEP: Tonight Jorge Ramos is in the spotlight once again. He will moderate a debate among Democrats Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton - a race that once again is intensely interesting. Ramos has interviewed candidates, presidents and other world leaders for decades now. He's about to publish a book about his experience and his view of journalism. It is called ""Take A Stand.""

Do you think of yourself as an advocacy journalist? Is that the right phrase for what you do?

RAMOS: I have been asking if I'm an activist or a journalist. And my answer is very simple. I'm just a journalist who asks questions. The difference is that I'm completely convinced that there are few moments, important moments, in which you have to take a stand as a journalist. When it comes to racism, discrimination, corruption, public lies, dictatorships and human rights, you have to take a stand as a reporter because I think our responsibility as journalist is to confront those who are abusing power. You know, I've been reading a lot about neutrality. Elie Wiesel, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, he says, we must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. In other words, as journalist, I'm completely convinced we have to take a stand sometimes.

INSKEEP: You work through in this book an account of a time that you believed that President Obama was wrong and in fact that you feel he broke a promise that he made in an interview with you regarding immigration reform. What did he say?

RAMOS: He was a candidate 2008. And he said, you know, I cannot promise that I'll propose immigration reform during the first 100 days, but I can do that within one year. And everybody in the Hispanic community call that la promesa de Obama, Obama's promise. And he just didn't keep his word.

INSKEEP: Well, this is an interesting part of this story, though. You assert that that would have made a difference, that had he gone ahead and proposed immigration reform early in his first term that it would have passed. Do you really believe that?

RAMOS: Not only do I believe that, it was so easy to understand. The Senate was controlled by the Democrats. The House was controlled by the Democrats. And they had all the votes. And they waited and waited and waited. If he really didn't mean that he was going to propose immigration reform during his first year in office then he shouldn't have promised that.

INSKEEP: How do you think it has affected your outlook on life that you are one of this very small group of people who can call up almost anybody and talk with them?

RAMOS: You know, I became a journalist - one of the reasons why I became a journalist was because I wanted to be able to talk to the people who are changing the world. And I do learn from powerful people. On the other hand, Oriana Fallaci, the Italian journalist who died recently...

INSKEEP: Right.

RAMOS: He used to say that interviews were a war and that sometimes the interview would win and sometimes the interviewer would win.

INSKEEP: Can you think of an interview where you feel like the interviewee won?

RAMOS: Oh, many times, (laughter) many times. I don't think I win most interviews. For instance, with Fidel Castro, I only spoke with him one minute and three seconds. But I think he won because I couldn't get anything from him. With the former president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, it happened exactly the same thing. And as a Mexican, for me it is incredibly frustrating to talk to the president of Mexico - former presidents of Mexico - because I can't get to them. It is very difficult. On the other hand - I know you'll find this surprising - but it is so refreshing to talk to American presidents because they are much more open than Latin American presidents.

INSKEEP: How many American presidents have you spoken with?

RAMOS: Every U.S. president since George Bush Sr. I have been able to...

INSKEEP: And you found them all relatively open to your questions?

RAMOS: Not relatively open - much more open than to talk to Latin American dictators or Latin American presidents. When you talk to a Latin American president, they make you feel so tiny right from the beginning, right from the moment when they shake your hands. Once I - I'm not going to say exactly in which country - but I asked to go to the bathroom right before the interview and a general followed me all the way to the bathroom...

INSKEEP: (Laughter).

RAMOS: ...And waited outside. But they make you feel you really have no power. And when you have 80 journalists who have been killed in Mexico, for instance, in the last decade, yeah, you realize how lucky we are here in the United States in which you can go to the White House, talk to the president and go back to your house. And then you can take a bike ride and go to the supermarket and no one is going to kill you. No one is going to do anything against you. That's a huge difference.

i toggle caption Sony Pictures Television Sony Pictures Television

Visiting the set of a historical drama can be a surreal experience, and Underground was no exception.

As the Louisiana sun beat down on an actual historical plantation near Baton Rouge last July, director Kate Woods oversaw a scene where an adorable small boy  actor Maceo Smedley  is picking cotton.

""Could someone go and put more blood on his hands?"" she shouted.

The second the filming stopped, someone dashed over with an umbrella to protect the 8-year-old from the stultifying heat, while the extras playing female field workers pulled bottles of Gatorade and cellphones from their 18th-century skirts.

Underground premieres on the basic cable channel WGN America tonight. It's the first major scripted drama taking the Underground Railroad as a setting. Enslaved people in the American South journeyed hundreds of miles to freedom, assisted by abolitionists, black and white. Given the drama of the actual history, it's almost hard to believe the Underground Railroad hasn't been a setting for a TV show before. (As it happens, NBC also planned a miniseries, called Freedom Run, last year, but it didn't pan out.)

Co-creators Misha Green and Joe Pokaski met while working as writers for the series Heroes, which ran for four seasons on NBC. It was Green's idea to draw on their shared love of comic books and action movies for a show that in some ways would be more 24 than Roots. They wanted to make it exciting and high-stakes, real and relevant.

i toggle caption Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television

Underground is, in the manner of Game of Thrones, a multilayered drama following different groups. Here: slave catchers, abolitionists, a plantation family in Georgia, the enslaved people forced to work there, and those who try to escape. Among them, a housemaid played by actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell. She compares Underground to spy thrillers where characters must rely on cryptic clues to make their way to freedom.

""They could use a star or they could use a song, or they could use code words or glances or markings on a tree,"" she says. The song ""Follow the Drinking Gourd,"" for example, is said to contain coded messages about navigating north by using the Big Dipper.

Other TV shows have dramatized American slavery  but not many. And such shows tend to be miniseries, not regularly scheduled dramas that could air for years. The great Roots, from 1977, was a miniseries. So was BET's critically acclaimed The Book of Negroes, from 2015. (Roots is scheduled for a remake this year.) The PBS series Mercy Street, which debuted this year, is set during the Civil War.

""But slavery is folded within it and not at all its center,"" writes Lisa Woolfork, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies representations of American slavery.

Woolfork says she's heard complaints about ""slavery fatigue"" since the success of high-profile movies such as 12 Years a Slave and Django Unchained. Writers Kara Brown in Jezebel and Demetria Lucas D'Oyley in The Root both recently wrote about it. Woolfork says she wholeheartedly understands wanting to put a shameful past behind us.

""We want to have it safely away so it doesn't impede on our everyday life,"" Woolfork says. ""But one way to understand why our present is the way it is, is rooted in the past. As Faulkner said, 'The past is never dead. It isn't even past.' ""

i toggle caption Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television

I hadn't yet talked to Woolfork when lead actor Aldis Hodge and production designer Meghan Rogers took me to Undeground's reconstructed slave quarters outside the Rural Life Museum at Louisiana State University  another exterior set. Seven wooden shacks were arranged around a vegetable garden, all authentic slave cabins from the 1830s that had been moved from another location.

""This was creepy sometimes,"" Rogers admitted.

""Very creepy,"" Hodge agreed. ""The first time on set, all of us, we didn't know where to step, we didn't know how to act, we didn't want to touch anything. You could feel the presence.""

Hodge says that sense of authenticity helped when he had to play very difficult scenes as the leader of the resistance. On one of the first days of shooting, he said, his character had to beg for his life on his knees after being caught.

""Those are the hard days,"" he said. ""It hurts, and there's no way you can come from set without taking a little piece of that with you.""

Filming Underground wasn't just emotionally draining for the actors. It was physically challenging. When Rogers created the set for the abolitionists' house, she built a secret passageways and a bunker where actors playing runaways had to crouch for hours.

""We play a lot of action of people standing on top of people hiding,"" she said. ""You could see a slave catcher standing right on top of someone.""

The production designer was incredibly attentive to tiny details and nuances. For example, she designed the dresses of the plantation housemaids to nearly fade into the wallpaper of the big house, so the women are almost like furniture. And she made the color yellow a motif  the color of freedom. It's the color of a ribbon carried by a runaway, and the color of the lanterns set in the window of the abolitionists' house as a signal.

""Throughout the entire show. I had somebody putting yellow flowers all over the place when they're on their journey,"" Rogers said. ""It's echoing the color of the lantern, the light of the lantern.""

It's fair to say that nothing in Underground is sepia-toned. The music is contemporary, and so is much of the language. Co-creator Misha Green said she aimed to pull American history off the wall of the proverbial museum.

""The Underground Railroad was the first integrated civil rights movement,"" she said. ""And it's a great example of when we work together, what we can go against. Which is 600 miles of crazy terrain being chased by slave catchers to get people to be what they should be in the first case  which is free.""",[]

John Powers reviews a new graphic novel that he describes as an astonishing work of imagination by the Singaporean writer and illustrator Sonny Liew. It's called The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. Our critic-at-large John Powers has a review of a new graphic novel that he describes as an astonishing work of imagination. It's by the Singaporean writer and illustrator Sonny Liew, who was born in Malaysia, studied philosophy at Cambridge University and is best known in the U.S. for his DC Comics series Doctor Fate about an Egyptian-American superhero. His new graphic novel, his biggest and most ambitious work, spans decades. Here's John's review of ""The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye.""

JOHN POWERS, BYLINE: It wasn't so long ago that comics were considered artistically marginal, adolescent fantasy. All that changed with the 1986 release of ""Maus."" Art Spiegelman's graphic novel - as they're now called - tackled the Holocaust and its effect on his family. ""Maus"" won a Pulitzer Prize and unleashed the ongoing wave of masterful books that includes Alan Moore's ""Watchmen,"" Chris Ware's ""Jimmy Corrigan"" and Allison Bechdel's ""Fun Home."" Grappling with everything from sex and politics to violence and alienation, these comics took you places that you haven't gone before.

That happens again in ""The Art of ""Charlie Chan Hock Chye,"" a startlingly brilliant tour de force by the Singapore artist and writer Sonny Liew. Although the premise sounds simple - it's the biography of a fictional comic book artist - what Liew does with it is anything but. At once dizzyingly meta and deeply heartfelt, the book spans 80 years and in its complicated layering remind me of everything from ""Maus"" and ""The Tin Drum"" to, believe it or not, ""Ulysses.""

The book's hero is Chan Hock Chye. His English-language name in a little joke is Charlie. Chan is born in 1938 Singapore. And from the beginning, this shopkeeper's son loves to draw. When he first discovers comic books at the local library, he's forever smitten. He dedicates his whole life to making them, becoming a monk of the craft. Never married, he turns down commercial jobs to spend decades creating comics that don't make money. But while Chan personally leads a quiet, almost invisible existence, his career is shot through with the great drama of history.

He lives through the epic transformation of his tiny island home from a Third World outpost of the British Empire to a sleek country often called the Switzerland of Asia, clean, orderly and so prosperous that its per capita GDP is one and a half times our own. Over the years, Chan experiences the Japanese invasion of World War II, Singapore's messy struggle for independence and the eventual emergence of a seemingly all-powerful ruling party. He watches this skillfully run if sometimes repressive state become a safe haven where billionaires move to stash their cash.

Now, Liew doesn't present this transformation so baldly. We watch it happen by reading the comics that Chan supposedly creates about these events. Of course, Liew himself creates them all, both naive and sophisticated, with dazzling virtuosity. Man, can this guy draw. Giving us a grand tour of comic book history, he works in styles that reference everything from Britain's ""The Beano"" and Japanese manga to Mad Magazine, ""Pogo,"" ""Spiderman,"" even Scrooge McDuck. Every page hums with visual invention, including those pages in which Liew himself turns up, a bespectacled little dude, to comment on the action.

Although ""The Art Charlie Chan Hock Chye"" is probably the greatest work of art ever produced in Singapore, the book was controversial there. It's not a country big on dissent, and Liew points out the cracks in the official myths erected by the party that's ruled for the last half-century. Yet at the same time, he hasn't written a subversive tract or poisoned pen letter.

Even as he regrets the country's missed opportunities, the book is filled with affection, even love. It's a Valentine to cartooning, to old buildings and street food, to heroes written out of official history, to ordinary people trying to make a better life. Most moving and most universal is Liew's portrait of the artist as a young, middle-aged and old man. By today's standards, Chan would be considered a failure. His work doesn't sell. His apartment is modest. And as the country around him grows richer and glossier, he lives in obscurity, all alone, creating comics about a success-mad culture that ignores him.

Near the end, the aging Chan jets to San Diego to attend Comic-Con in hopes of finding kindred spirits and maybe landing some work. The trip doesn't pan out, yet he doesn't let this disappointment stop him. Back home, surrounded by his pens and ink bottle, he keeps doing what he's always done - pursuing his art in the face of a world that doesn't seem to want it. You see, Chan would rather remain marginal forever than give up doing what he cares about most. And Liew makes it heartbreakingly clear that such devotion is one of the highest forms of grace.

GROSS: John Powers is film and TV critic for Vogue and vogue.com. He reviewed ""The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye"" by Sonny Liew.

npr.org,,Language To Use And Not Use When Reporting About The Occupation In Oregon,[],"Language To Use And Not Use When Reporting About The Occupation In Oregon

As of Monday, Jan. 4 a.m. 10 a.m. ET:

 We are not using the words militia or militiamen on their own. A militia is organized to resemble an army (Websters New World College Dictionary, Fifth Edition). At most, this group may be called a self-described or self-styled militia. It doesnt resemble an army. Note: Reporting indicates there may only be a dozen or so men doing the occupying.

 We are not calling this a standoff. A standoff requires two sides. Right now, one group is occupying some lands and buildings while the other (the government) is considering what to do. Theres an occupation and it may become a standoff, but its not there yet.

 We have been using the words protesters and armed protesters. But the word protesters is not entirely adequate. These are armed individuals who have occupied government property. They are not simply citizens peacefully expressing their opinions, which is how the word protesters is more often used. This is an armed occupation. They are armed occupiers. They are armed men or armed individuals.

Militants is a better word than protesters. A militant is ready and willing to fight, according to Websters. These men say they are. The dictionary also says a militant is vigorous or aggressive in supporting or promoting a cause.

 As weve previously discussed, its best to avoid labels if possible. Use action words to describe who these people are and what they want. They are an armed group. They want an end to federal management of public land in the west. They are armed anti-federalists who want the states to control public lands in the west (referring to them simply as anti-government is not quite right).

Addition at 1:30 p.m. ET:

When referring to the dispute that Cliven Bundy and others have with the federal government, dont say its over grazing rights. Instead, say grazing fees, grazing privileges, grazing permits or some combination of those words  such as grazing permits and fees.

Its that time of year again, so heres a reminder:

If you feel a holiday cliche trying to tiptoe into your copy, please resist.

From last years post on this topic:

  Tis the season to ... No, it tisnt.   Twas the night before ... It twas?  Over the river and through the woods ... Its been a while since we rode a sleigh to grandmothers house.  Bah, humbug. Be miserly with your references to Dickens.  Oh, the weather outside is ... Dont put that song in my head!  Its beginning to look a lot like ... Not that one either!  Yes, Virginia. No, Korva.  Christmas came early for ... Really? Seems like its always on Dec. 25.  Jing-a-ling. Jing-a-dont.  A Christmas Grinch stole ... Every burglar doesnt have to be be turned into a Dr. Seuss character this time of year.  Santas elves ... Theyre everywhere!  On the Xth day of Christmas ... The song is boring enough as it is.

As we also said last year, you may be able to play around with these holiday evergreens. You might stand one on its head, so to speak.

But the guidance weve given about adjectives applies in most cases to cliches as well: if you see one, kill it.

In other words, say no, no, no, not ho, ho, ho.

There have been times in recent weeks when potentially offensive language  bleeped, thankfully  was broadcast without a discussion beforehand with senior editors. Thats disturbing given the number of reminders that have gone out concerning such language and our policy. It should not happen.

Hopefully the points that follow are clear:

1. We have a detailed Policy On Use Of Potentially Offensive Language. Print it and read it.

2. Any clip with offensive language must be brought to the attention of the DMEs well before air time. Basically, as soon as you think you might be using it, talk to them. They may need time to consult with Legal.

Note: It does not matter if the words have already been bleeped. Be prepared to justify their use. a. By the way, its assumed show executive producers and desk chiefs will already have been consulted.

b. The standards & practices editor should also be flagged.

3. The DMEs have yea-or-nay authority.

4. DACs lines must tell stations the specific language that is in the cut, when it occurs and whether it is bleeped. Those lines must go out with as much lead time as we can give.

5. If the words are bleeped, they must be completely bleeped. No syllable can be heard.

6. We do all this because we respect our audience and know that certain language will offend many. We also know that community standards vary around the nation and that complaints to the FCC can be costly to our member stations.

7. Overall, NPR is conservative about potentially offensive language  not permissive. Theres a key line right at the top of our policy statement: NPR has always set a high bar on use of language that may be offensive to our audience. The words must be important to the piece.

Questions? See Chuck, Gerry or me.

i toggle caption Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist

Thanks to his production work on almost every Beatles album released in the 1960s  up through Abbey Road  Sir George Martin was often regarded as ""The Fifth Beatle."" As a producer and composer, Martin  who died Tuesday at the age of 90  assembled a body of work that spanned more than half of a century and was as varied as it is legendary. Encompassing acts as diverse as Ella Fitzgerald, Cilla Black, The Beatles and Peter Gabriel, Martin was arguably the most successful record producer in the history of popular music.

After accepting a job as an assistant to the president of the small U.K. label Parlophone Records in 1950, Martin was named the label's president just five years later. Thanks to his hands-on working relationship with the artists signed to his label, Martin was able to use his musical gifts to nurture those of the artists with which he worked. In the summer of 1962, he signed an act he described as ""pretty awful"" (at that time); known as The Beatles, the group would go on, with Martin's help, to revolutionize popular music and irrevocably transform the cultural landscape.

After The Beatles split in 1969, Martin worked with Kenny Rogers, Kate Bush, Elton John and Celine Dion, among many others, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. Though he ""retired"" in '98, Martin then worked with his son, producer Giles Martin, to reimagine and remix a selection of Beatles music for the Cirque du Soleil show Love. The package serves as a de facto history of popular music, beginning with 1950s big-band material and continuing through the '90s, in the process demonstrating the elder Martin's massive influence on the course of modern popular music.

""The Native American wizarding community was particularly gifted in animal and plant magic, its potions in particular being of a sophistication beyond much that was known in Europe.""

That's what J.K. Rowling writes in the first of a four-part essay series, collectively called History of Magic in North America. ""The most glaring difference between magic practised by Native Americans and the wizards of Europe was the absence of a wand.""

It's just one tidbit from the essay titled ""Fourteenth Century  Seventeenth Century"" and published on the Pottermore website on Tuesday.

The writing is full of details to whet fans' appetites ahead of the November release of the Harry Potter spinoff film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Set in New York City in 1926, the movie documents the life of wizard Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne), who wrote the ""Fantastic Beasts"" textbook featured in the Harry Potter series.

For example, Rowling writes that ""while every nationality has its own term for 'Muggle,' the American community uses the slang term No-Maj, short for 'No Magic.' "" The essay also explains the ""legend of the Native American 'skin walker'  an evil witch or wizard that can transform into an animal at will.""

The remaining three parts will publish, one per day through Friday, at 8 a.m. ET on Pottermore. The series will cover magic-related topics in North America, such as the Salem witch trials and other native American legends.",[]

Please use phrases such as secretly recorded and covertly recorded when referring to the videos made by anti-abortion activists.

Undercover is another useful word. True, it may invoke in some listeners minds the image of a government spy who has gone under cover, but as an adjective it means acting or carried out in secret.

We have concluded that sting doesnt apply because it is defined as an elaborate confidence game or an elaborately planned operation engaged in by law enforcement agents to entrap criminals. Those dont fit in this context.

BILL KURTIS: From NPR in WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. Hey Gladys Knight, forget about Georgia. Take a midnight train to Bill - Bill Kurtis. And here is your host at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Peter Sagal.

(APPLAUSE)

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Thank you, Bill.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Why, that is some Southern hospitality. We are so happy to be back here at the beautiful Fox Theatre in downtown Atlanta. Later on, we are going to be joined onstage by Georgia native Trisha Yearwood, who went from being an aspiring country singer to one of the biggest country music stars of all time. She's a lifestyle guru, a TV star. We'll ask her when you are that successful, how do you keep writing sad songs?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Still, her last single ""My Private Jet Is So Empty Without You...""

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: ...Still went to number one. We want to hear your complaints, no matter how petty they might be. Give us a call. The number is 1-888-WAIT-WAIT. It is time to welcome our first listener contestant. Hi, you're on WAIT WAIT... DONT TELL ME.

KATE FINLEY: Hi, Peter, this is Kate. I'm calling from Athens, Ga.

SAGAL: Athens, Ga?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: There are some fans here.

FINLEY: (Laughter).

SAGAL: Athens, Ga., known as the Athens of Georgia.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: That's the home of the University, right, University of Georgia?

FINLEY: That's true.

SAGAL: That's true and...

FAITH SALIE: And the home of The B-52's and R.E.M.

SAGAL: That's also true.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Is there anything about Athens you can tell us that we don't already know?

FINLEY: Athens is crazy. There's the university, obviously, the music. And I'm a neuropsychologist here, and I play in a couple bands. And...

SAGAL: Oh, you play in a band? What kind of music do you play?

FINLEY: I play rock, punk.

SAGAL: Oh, I've got to ask, what is your punk band called?

FINLEY: Sex Barbecue.

ROY BLOUNT, JR.: Ooh.

(LAUGHTER)

BLOUNT: Ooh.

SAGAL: Wait a minute - not the Sex barbecue.

FINLEY: The only Sex Barbecue.

PAULA POUNDSTONE: That is a great Southern punk band name.

SAGAL: It really is.

FINLEY: We just put two of our favorite things together.

SAGAL: I think so.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: It makes sense. Kate, terrific to talk to you. Let me introduce you to our panel this week. First up, it's a comedian who will be appearing at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee on March 12, it's Paula Poundstone.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Next, it's a humorist and the author of the new book out this March, I'm really happy to say, ""Save Room For Pie."" It's Roy Blount, Jr.

(APPLAUSE)

BLOUNT: Hey. Hey, Kate.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: And finally, it's a contributor to ""CBS Sunday Morning,"" whose debut book ""Approval Junkie,"" in part about her growing up right here in Atlanta, will be released in April. It is Faith Salie.

SALIE: Hey, Kate.

FINLEY: Hey.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: So Kate, welcome to the show. You know what we're going to do. We're going to start the show off with Who's Bill This Time? Bill Kurtis is going to read for you three quotations from the week's news. Your job, of course, explain or identify to two of them, you'll win our prize - the voice of scorekeeper emeritus Carl Kasell on your home answering machine. You ready to go?

FINLEY: I'm ready. Hey, Bill.

SAGAL: All right, here is your first quote.

KURTIS: ""I love the poorly educated.""

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: That was a man giving a shout-out to one of the many demographics supporting him in his triumphant march to the Republican nomination. Who is it?

FINLEY: That must be Donald Trump.

SAGAL: Yes, that would be his last name...

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: ...Took you a second to remember it. Donald Trump - there is this moment in horror movies - I'm sure you've seen it - where the kids who have wandered into the old mansion on a dare realize that the kindly old man who lives there is really crazy. That's America right now.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: And we're all saying, come on, this isn't funny anymore. Let us out. Now, Trump did promise that with him, we would win so much, quote, ""we'd get tired of winning,"" unquote. Well, now that Donald Trump has won three states, we are tired of him winning. So...

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Now, he said in his speech - he was going through all the people who support him - you know, educated, uneducated. They - all those people who keep voting for him say they like him because he's says what's on his mind, no filters. But filters are good.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Filters are what give us coffee.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: They...

SALIE: Give us good selfies.

SAGAL: Exactly. What would we do on Instagram without filters? They keep your cigarette from killing you instantly.

BLOUNT: Right.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: You know who else doesn't like filters? Cholera.

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: I secretly though would love to see Melania be the first lady, OK, you know?

SAGAL: That would be pretty awesome.

SALIE: Like, she's not going to worry about childhood obesity or literacy. She's going to be, like, my platform is sunscreen.

SAGAL: Her platform is going to be - she wants to be, like, provide liposuction for the upper-middle-class...

SALIE: Right.

SAGAL: ...You know?

(LAUGHTER)

BLOUNT: Once he really lets her hair down and we get to know her...

SAGAL: I think it'll be great.

BLOUNT: ...I'm sure we'll warm up to her.

SAGAL: Now, people have said 'cause...

BLOUNT: Where is she from, by the way, Melania?

SAGAL: She's from Slovenia, I believe.

BLOUNT: Slovenia, oh, I thought...

SAGAL: She's a Slovenian model.

BLOUNT: See, I thought her name was Slovenia and she was from Melania.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: It's hard to tell.

POUNDSTONE: It happens with people from Chad.

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, Kate, here is your next quote.

KURTIS: (Imitating Southern accent) ""There's not a snowball's chance in hell that's going to happen.""

SAGAL: That was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying there's no way in hell the Senate is going to do what?

FINLEY: Approve a nominee for the Supreme Court justice...

SAGAL: That's exactly...

FINLEY: ...by Obama.

SAGAL: ...Right.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: That's exactly right, very good.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: We also would've accepted anything.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So the Republican Senate, led by Sen. McConnell, says they will refuse to consider any nomination the president puts forward to replace late Justice Scalia. He won't have hearings. They won't hold a vote. They won't even meet with the nominee. What if the nominee stops by anyway? It'll be weird to walk through the Senate office building and see Orrin Hatch standing behind a curtain going shhh...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: The Senate has never done anything like this before in our entire history. But the Republicans are pointing to something Joe Biden said 20 years ago as support for their position. Dudes, you can find a Joe Biden quote that will support anything.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: It's like hey, why are you jumping off that roof holding a kite in each hand? Well, Joe Biden said it would be cool.

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: Here's the answer...

SAGAL: What's the answer?

SALIE: This is so obvious. Obama should appoint or nominate Donald Trump.

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: This will appeal to Trump's ego.

SAGAL: Yeah.

SALIE: And then the Republicans won't have to worry about him. They can say sure, they can approve the nomination.

SAGAL: Yeah.

SALIE: Put him on the Supreme Court.

SAGAL: Do you want Donald Trump on the Supreme Court?

SALIE: But he'll be surrounded by other people who can buffer the nutterness (ph).

SAGAL: Yeah, or here's another alternative since our government is totally gridlocked, why not just keep Justice Scalia on the bench postmortem?

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: That...

SAGAL: Seriously, think about it. He was old anyway. A little makeup, you staple his robe to the back of the chair so it doesn't slump.

SALIE: And he would still be more animated than Clarence Thomas.

SAGAL: Exactly.

(APPLAUSE)

POUNDSTONE: You know, do you think it's too early for dead Supreme Court-justice jokes?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right - all right, Kate, here is your last quote.

KURTIS: ""The Academy is mainly old white men, so either you wait for them all to die or kill them off slowly.""

SAGAL: That was Emma Thompson offering two alternatives to solving the problem hounding what award show this weekend?

FINLEY: That would be the Oscars.

SAGAL: It would be the Oscars...

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: ...Yes. The Oscars...

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: ...This weekend will be the whitest Academy Awards we've had since all the other Academy Awards.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: This is true - the array of Oscar-nominated actors male and female, leading and supporting, is actually less racially and ethnically diverse than the complete roster of GOP presidential candidates.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Now, this happened, this strange whiteout, if you will, happened not because there are no black people in good movies. For example, Michael B. Jordan starred in the movie ""Creed."" You liked the movie. He's a great actor. But he didn't get a nomination for Best Actor, but his co-star Sylvester Stallone got nominated for best supporting actor. Now, it is one thing to lose out to a white guy. It's way worse to lose out to a man covered in what looks like old naugahyde.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: But I really have to say, having no people of color on stage is a shame and unforgivable in terms of...

BLOUNT: Not any...

SAGAL: ...representing the life. Don't you think that, guys, Faith?

SALIE: #WaitWaitSoWhite.

SAGAL: Paula.

SALIE: White White... Don't Tell Me.

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Bill, how did Kate do on our quiz?

KURTIS: Well, she did so well, we're going to order three orders of Sex Barbecue.

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: Yum.

FINLEY: Thank you.

SAGAL: Thank you so much for playing, Kate.

""Chug, chug, chug. Puff, puff, puff. Ding-dong, ding-dong.""

The beloved tale of the little blue engine  who helps bring a broken-down train of toys to the good little boys and girls on the other side of the mountain  has been chugging along for a very long time. But despite the locomotive's optimistic refrain  I think I can, I think I can, I think I can  the story has a somewhat checkered past: In its tracks, The Little Engine has left both a legal battle and a debate over whether the little blue engine is male or female.

The exact origins of the plucky, blue switch engine are a mystery. Variations on the tale have been around for more than 100 years.

""Interestingly, the oldest version of the story I could find was published in 1903 in Sweden,"" says Roy Plotnick, who spent 10 years investigating the little engine's back story as a hobby. (By day, Plotnick is a paleontologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago).

Another version he found appeared in a New York newspaper article in 1906 about a church in Brooklyn that had finally paid off its mortgage after 39 years. The article reported on the minister's sermon: ""They had a mortgage burning,"" says Plotnick, and the minister told a parable that is recognizable as a version of the story of the little engine:

He then went to another great engine and asked: ""Can you pull that train over the hill?"" ""It is a very heavy grade,"" it replied. The superintendent was much puzzled, but he turned to still another engine that was spick-and-span new, and he asked it: ""Can you pull that train over the hill?"" ""I think I can,"" responded the engine.

The most familiar version of the tale was inspired by a story called ""The Pony Engine"" and published in a children's magazine in 1916 by Massachusetts educator Mabel Bragg. She added new elements to the story including the broken-down train carrying cargo for kids like toys, peppermint drops, and  every child's favorite vegetable  spinach.

The first time The Little Engine That Could was published as a book was in 1930 with the credit ""as retold by Watty Piper,"" a pseudonym for Arnold Munk, who died in 1957. His daughter, Janet Fenton, was never too fond of the pen name.

""I think it's ridiculous, but he seemed to like it so that's what he used,"" says Fenton.

With all of the different versions of the engine story being told in one form or another, small wonder that Munk faced a legal battle. In the 1950s, a woman claimed that it was her cousin  Frances Ford  who wrote the story in 1910. The details of the case were sealed but Fenton says her father prevailed.

""I don't know if he sued somebody or somebody sued him, but he won,"" says Fenton.

Still, publishers of The Little Engine That Could did agree to let another company print an adaptation of Ford's story under the title The Pony Engine.

Now, to the next controversy: Children who read the story may not think much about whether the little blue engine is male or female. But adults do. If you remember the story, three trains  all male  refuse to help the broken-down engine over the mountain. They are too important, too busy, or too tired to pull an engine full of toys. (""I won't carry the likes of you!"" they said to the disappointed dolls and stuffed animals).

The little blue engine who (after significant cajoling) agrees to help is female  and also self-deprecating. ""They only use me for switching trains in the yard. I have never been on the other side of the mountain,"" she protests.

My colleague Beth Novey says that The Little Engine That Could was ""leaning in"" long before Sheryl Sandberg was. Francesco Sedita, president of the Penguin division that publishes The Little Engine That Could, likes the characterization.

She was ""literally the first to lean in! She really is the poster engine of the can-do attitude,"" says Sedita.

Now, over the years, some versions of the little blue engine have been male. And some folks have gotten pretty steamed over the issue. When the engine is a ""she,"" people have assumed the gender was changed to make the story politically correct. But in fact, she was a ""she"" as early as 1930.

Blogger Lara McKusky argues that the little blue engine is a do-it-all, Supermom martyr who is pressured into pulling more than she signed on for  while male trains had no problem setting boundaries and saying no.

Whatever your views on the little blue engine  male or female  the idea of a small train beating the odds through sheer will and determination is so old and so recognizable, it just had to be parodied. In 1976, Saturday Night Live did a bit about a little engine who has a heart attack and dies.

NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Somini Sengupta, the former New Delhi bureau chief for The New York Times, about her book, The End of Karma: Hope and Fury Among India's Young.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Somini Sengupta left India as a young child in 1975. Thirty years later, she returned as the New Delhi bureau chief for The New York Times. The 21st century country she found as a journalist was nothing like the one her parents grew up in. Today, India is youngest country in the world with 365 million people between the ages of 10 and 24. A million turn 18 every month.

SOMINI SENGUPTA: They join the labor force. They register to vote. They embrace the Internet, many of them for the first time. They fall in love. And all those things change their own country profoundly.

SHAPIRO: It's a country with a democratic government, a country with constitutional guarantees. And that means it's a country with enormous expectations and challenges.

SENGUPTA: One is how to level the playing field so that there's at least some equality of opportunity for both men and women and, I would argue, particularly women who have really not enjoyed the equality that the Constitution of India had promised them 70 years ago. And the other related challenge is how much to let this generation speak their mind. India has always had a very ambivalent relationship with free expression, and that is all the more pronounced now during the Internet age.

SHAPIRO: Somini Sengupta follows seven young people and their aspirations in her latest book, ""The End Of Karma: Hope And Fury Among India's Young.""

SENGUPTA: I call this ""The End Of Karma"" because the people I write about - they're all trying to overcome their past. They were born with one destiny. They are trying to make another. And they're all stories of incredible grit and resilience and great hope but also a bit of fury - quite a bit of fury, which is why the subtitle of the book is ""Hope And Fury Among India's Young.""

SHAPIRO: And this idea of trying to overcome your past - how new is that for India - that your past is not necessarily destined to be your future.

SENGUPTA: I'll tell you the story of one child who I met in reporting this book. Her name what's in reporting this book. Her name is Varsha (ph). She was the daughter of what's known as a presswala (ph). Her family had a business pressing clothes at the end of a block under a tree. And ever since Varsha was a small girl, she would go around collecting the rumpled bundles of clothes, and she would help her parents pressing them - saris and salwar kameezes and button-down shirts. And the one thing she didn't want to be was a presswala or a presswala's wife. And she really, really wanted to be a cop, a policewoman.

And her father, who was her great champion, was also very much against this idea. He wanted to marry her off to a good family, and he couldn't bear the idea of her being a policewoman. So the story of Varsha is really the story of a girl who tries to overcome her past, who tries to grow wings and a story of a father who has to decide how far he will let her go.

SHAPIRO: Do you expect that five years from now she'll be a police officer or a presswala or something else?

SENGUPTA: I think it depends largely on how hard Varsha is willing to push. She has already pushed her father to go quite a mile. Her father did not want her to even finish high school or go to college. He was very nervous about what would happen to her, and she's managed to push him ever so steadily just by dint of determination and resilience. But she has also had to tamp down her dreams every step of the way.

SHAPIRO: So many of the stories in this book reminded me of stories we hear about early 20th century America. And almost the minute that thought entered my head, (laughter) I reached the sentence you wrote, this country is not a country of Horatio Algers, referring, of course, to the quintessential story of transcending destiny in early 20th century America. So while many of the stories do follow this model that the U.S. seems to have followed a hundred years ago, you're saying, no, there's a big difference here.

SENGUPTA: Well, I think the myth of Horatio Alger has increasingly been shown to be a myth even in our own country. But I think you're absolutely right that the parallels between India and the United States are just remarkable. India was a very unlikely country at its birth in 1947. It was made up of a bunch of different ethnicities, a lot of different languages. And frankly, there were a lot of naysayers who said there's no way that a country that is so poor, that is so diverse is ever going to hold together.

It did hold together, and it has made some remarkable gains since independence. My parents, who were born during the independence era - they're called midnight's children. In their time, life expectancy was 32, and today, it's 66. In their time, infant mortality rates were sky high, and now it's diminished remarkably. In my father's time, when he went to school, there were fewer than half of all Indian children who were enrolled in school. They certainly didn't include dalits or outcasts. They certainly didn't include many girls. And today, nearly all Indian children are in school.

SHAPIRO: Your parents, who, as you say, came of age in the era of Indian independence, were known as midnight's children, a phrase made famous by Salman Rushdie in his novel. You call this young generation noonday's children. Explain what that means.

SENGUPTA: This generation of Indians, because their expectations are so high, they are so demanding and so restive in many ways that I think of India at this moment as a country at high noon. And I'll tell you one story. I remember going out to a school in rural India in a state called Bihar. And it was wintertime, and it was early in the morning. It was a bright, sunny, crisp morning. The mist was rising from the fields. And all these children were just streaming into school, carrying these empty rice sacks because that's what they would sit on. There was not enough chairs or tables or benches for them, and so they would spread them out on the floor, on the grass outside of school, and they would try to get an education.

Now, I went there with a remarkable Indian NGO called Bhutan. They were trying to assess what children were actually learning in school. And as it turned out, half of all fifth-graders couldn't read a basic sentence. Half of all fifth-graders couldn't subtract. And these were children who had been in school for five years. And I'll never forget what one of the social workers who I accompanied - he said to me, you know, when these children grow up, they'll curse us. They'll say, we came to school, and we learned nothing.

SHAPIRO: And your commitment to these people whose stories you tell really comes across in the book where, again and again, I was struck by the number of times you would follow up with a 14-year-old as a 17-year-old (laughter) or an 18-year-old as a 21-year-old, not just tracking their stories but perhaps giving them career advice and helping provide perspective. You come across as very, very invested in these stories.

SENGUPTA: Well, thank you. I did get pretty close to all of these young people, some more than others. And I have to say, I had to resist giving the girl that I described earlier, Varsha - I had to resist giving her too much career advice because I did, at one point, consider giving her the form - the application form to fill out for the Indian Police Service. And then I stopped myself. I thought, well, you know, that's for her to do.

SHAPIRO: Somini Sengupta covers the United Nations for The New York Times, and her new book is called ""The End Of Karma: Hope And Fury Among India's Young"" - great talking to you. Thank you so much.

SENGUPTA: Thank you, Ari.

In 1962, George Martin signed an unknown band: The Beatles. Steve Inskeep talks to Ray Connolly, who made a documentary series with Martin called The Rhythm of Life, about Martin's death at age 90.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

We are remembering Sir George Martin, who died yesterday at the age of 90. In 1962, while working for a British record label, he signed an unknown band called The Beatles. We're going to talk now with author and filmmaker Ray Connolly, who interviewed The Beatles many times and also made a documentary series with George Martin about music called ""The Rhythm Of Life."" Welcome to the program, sir.

RAY CONNOLLY: Good morning.

INSKEEP: Producer can be so many things for a musical group. What was Martin's job, really, with The Beatles?

CONNOLLY: He was the arranger. When they'd bring a song in, he's listen to it and say, well, you know, this is - this is OK. But have you thought about doing it in four-four time or maybe doing three-four time? That sort of thing - and then he would add all these instruments. He would sort of say, well, you know, that's great. But what else can you do? And then The Beatles would sort of throw out ideas themselves. So they would work in very, very close collaboration. The great thing about it was that George Martin knew everything there was to know about classical music. The Beatles knew whatever there was to know about rock n roll but nothing about classical music. So you put the two together - fantastic symbiosis. And so George took The Beatles from just rock n roll to ""Penny Lane,"" ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" ""Sgt. Pepper.""

INSKEEP: And added sophistication to the music, I would imagine.

CONNOLLY: Absolutely.

INSKEEP: What you're describing is the role of an editor, really, which can be psychologically challenging for the artist because Martin is the guy telling you your song is not right or your song is not complete. They must have really trusted him.

CONNOLLY: Well, yeah, at first, you know, they would do whatever he said because, you know, he was the boss. He was like a schoolteacher. And that's the way he came across all the time. He was like a schoolteacher. And he helped them. And then later on, of course, they wanted to have more say. In the end, when they finished - when they finished recording together, John Lennon - and actually John was being a bit mean about this. He kind of said, well, you know, we want to do it ourselves now. They weren't as good without George Martin.

INSKEEP: Did they resent it a little bit when there were stories suggesting that Martin was the guy who was...

CONNOLLY: Yeah, I think they did. I think John did. But then later on, he and George got together. And I remember George telling me how he'd been talking to John. And John had said, I wish I could record the songs again. George said, well, which songs, John? He said, all of them. But with George Martin doing it, you know.

INSKEEP: Oh, my goodness.

CONNOLLY: He was that important, you know.

INSKEEP: And when you listen to Beatles music, is there something - or anybody's music, really - is there something that causes you to say, that's George Martin? That's George Martin in there.

CONNOLLY: I can certainly do it on Beatle records because I know exactly what he did. On ""Penny Lane,"" played piano - he introduced the piccolo and the trumpet (ph), things like that. You know, if The Beatles hadn't met George Martin, they'd have been a fantastic rock 'n' roll band. Because they met George Martin, who would take them, you know, in other directions, they were much more interesting.

INSKEEP: Can I just mention there's something about Beatles music that feels timeless? There's so much music from the '60s that might be great music. But it's music from the '60s. The Beatles' music feels a little different to me. Was that George Martin's influence, particularly that classical music influence you mentioned?

CONNOLLY: I think it was partly that. I think, you know, rock 'n' roll is - it's American music. The Beatles took it further. And they made it English music - very, very English music. So you know, I mean, songs like ""Penny Lane,"" they are very English. And that's partly George too. I mean, when Paul sang ""When I'm 64,"" that was like an old-time English musical song. Well, George know how to do it, you know? Paul would say, well, what about this? And George would say, well, hang on. I've got an idea. At Abbey Road where they recorded, there was this sort of band room and these old instruments there. And the boys would bring things out and say, what does this sound like? And George would say, well, you can do this and do that with it, you know? Add a harpsichord here. Add this. Add that - you know? - fantastic.

INSKEEP: You said another interesting thing I hadn't thought about. We think of this British group that grabbed an American music style and even played, you know, old American tunes on some of their early records.

CONNOLLY: Yeah.

INSKEEP: But you're saying that Martin was the one who made them what they really were.

CONNOLLY: I think he was. I think he was. And I mean, The Beatles may say, no, we could do it without him. But I doubt it. I think George brought a hell of a lot to them.

INSKEEP: Author and filmmaker Ray Connolly, who knew George Martin for many years. Thanks very much.

CONNOLLY: You're welcome.

npr.org,2016-03-09 00:00:00,'What Is Not Yours' Is Flawless,[],"'What Is Not Yours' Is Flawless

Most writers would give everything they own to have just one masterpiece to their name. British author Helen Oyeyemi is barely 31, and she already has at least three of them. That includes her last two novels, Mr. Fox and Boy, Snow, Bird, both of which received extensive critical acclaim in the U.S. and around the world.

It also includes her latest book, the short story collection What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours. The book contains the same sly humor, gorgeous writing and magical characters as her previous efforts. It is, in a word, flawless.

The nine stories in the book are mostly linked  characters in early stories show up in later ones, to wonderful effect. And the stories are all joined thematically; each one has a lock or key as a significant plot point. The result is that the book feels like a novel, but one that moves freely through time and geography.

The collection opens with ""Books and Roses,"" a remarkable love story about Montserrat, a foundling girl left in a Catalonia chapel with a key hanging around her neck. She grows up and finds work in a laundry, where she encounters Senora Lucy, a painter who also wears a key. Montserrat eventually discovers that she and Lucy are linked when she finds the lock that fits her key. Her reaction is bittersweet: ""She'd carried the key to this place for so long and now that she was there she didn't know where she was.""

In ""'Sorry' Doesn't Sweeten Her Tea"" (Oyeyemi clearly has a gift for great titles), sisters Day and Aisha, who are being raised by their father and his boyfriend, deal with the news that their favorite singer has been accused of savagely beating a woman. Day returns later in the funny, deeply sweet ""A Brief History of the Homely Wench Society,"" as a member of the titular club, formed at Cambridge University as an answer to an all-male student association.

Aisha, as well as some other characters from previous stories, is featured in ""Freddy Barrandov Checks ... In?"", about a young man being pressured to work in the hotel that employs his parents. Freddy is resistant to the idea: ""She wants to see good hearts and good brains put to proper use, but I'm not convinced that everybody ought to live like that, or even that everybody can.""

Oyeyemi seems to be incapable of writing anything that's not wholly original. ""Is Your Blood As Red As This?"" follows the lives of students at a bizarre puppetry school; one character is a ghost, and another, Rowan, is a ""wooden devil"" in genderless human form. ""No matter how soft his skin appears to be he is entirely wooden, and it is not known exactly what animates him  no clock ticks in his chest,"" Oyeyemi writes. ""His fellow students already had all those confusing hormone surges to deal with. So most of them stayed away, though I'm sure they all dreamed of him, her, hir, zir, a body with a tantalizing abundance of contours, this Rowan who is everything but mostly tree.""

It's one thing to write so beautifully about youth and desire; it's another thing entirely to do it in such a vividly imagined, unique setting. Oyeyemi manages to make the story both realistic and fantastical, and the characters are rendered with grace and compassion.

You could say the same thing for every story in What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours, from the subtle ""Presence"" to the chilling ""If a Book Is Locked There's Probably a Good Reason for That Don't You Think."" And even in the darkest moments of the book, Oyeyemi never loses her sense of humor  as one character notes, ""Sometimes I dream I'm falling, and it's not so much frightening as it is tedious, just falling and falling until I'm sick of it, but then a noose stops me short and I think, well, at least I'm not falling anymore.""

What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours is a lot of things: dreamy, spellbinding, and unlike just about anything you can imagine. It's a book that resists comparisons; Oyeyemi's talent is as unique as it is formidable. It's another masterpiece from an author who seems incapable of writing anything that's less than brilliant.",[]

Republicans continued to post stunning voter-turnout numbers Tuesday night. In the four states that voted on the GOP side, turnout far exceeded what the party saw in 2012.

In Hawaii's, Michigan's and Mississippi's Republican races, turnout this year was 30 to 40 percent higher than it was in 2012. Idaho posted a nearly 400 percent bump, but that may be due in part to the fact that this year was a primary, whereas the party held a caucus in 2012; those contests tend to draw smaller crowds.

Democrats' numbers likewise require some context. In Michigan, this year's turnout far outstripped that in the state's 2008 contest. But then, in 2008, Barack Obama and John Edwards both bowed out of Michigan's race when the state broke party rules and scheduled its primary too early. That may have helped depress turnout.

Add together the 23 states where Republicans have voted or caucused this year, and you get 12.4 million people. That's nearly 5 million more GOP voters thus far this primary season than in those same states in 2012  a bump of nearly 67 percent across those states.

Contrast that with the Democratic side, whose turnout dropoff is nearly a mirror image of the GOP's spike, with nearly 8.7 million people voting thus far across 21 states' Democratic contests. That's down by nearly 23 percent from the party's stellar turnout in 2008.",[]

npr.org,2014-07-28 00:00:00,Tales Of Migration Explore Modern-Day Odysseys And 'Hyphenated Identities' : Code Switch : NPR,[],"Tales Of Migration Explore Modern-Day Odysseys And 'Hyphenated Identities'

For many writers, the migrant's journey is a storytellers' dream. The transition from one part of the world to another is filled with anticipation, conflict and inherent literary drama. While trains and planes become the mundane means of transportation for most travelers, those trips can herald life-changing transformations for a migrant remaking his or her life through that journey.

Novelist Amitav Ghosh is finishing an epic trilogy of novels  Sea of Poppies, River of Smoke, Flood of Fire  set at sea in the midst of the Opium Wars of the 19th century. They're filled with countless characters from around the world navigating the stormy seas in search of better lives.

The novels examine questions of empire, power and class, but the real star of Ghosh's books is an old-fashioned sailing ship named the Ibis. The former slave ship begins its journey in Baltimore and sails around Africa, onto India and China after it's bought by a British merchant living in Calcutta. As the Ibis docks in ports around the world, a global cast of characters assembles on board  which allows Ghosh to craft a kaleidoscopic portrait of characters.

""The journeys of the people who've come there are themselves so interesting,"" Ghosh says. ""What brings people into this very enclosed space  people with such different histories and experiences  all of that creates endless possibilities."" Beyond the literary possibilities, Ghosh says that convergence of identities echoes the way modern migration has brought so many people together.

""Every ship was in a sense a microcosm of the world,"" says Ghosh, who was inspired by Herman Melville's Moby Dick. ""This is one of Melville's great themes ... how completely different kinds of people are thrust together and how very often their roles just completely change.""

Change is also at the heart of Yann Martel's best-selling novel Life of Pi and its Oscar-winning film adaptation. An Indian boy sailing to Canada with his family survives a shipwreck. He's lost at sea on a lifeboat with a tiger. They must learn to coexist, and they forge a community of survivors.

""The notion of shipwreck in the Life of Pi I think is a perfect metaphor for the experience of exile,"" says Reza Aslan, a best-selling author and editor of the anthology Tablet and Pen. ""Being adrift, looking for a land to call home, that's an experience that I myself have experienced as an exile from Iran,"" he says.

Aslan says Life of Pi shows how the immigrant's journey leaves an individual unmoored  how it throws an identity into flux.

The idea of how immigrants reconcile their past with the future inspired Jhumpa Lahiri's novel The Namesake, which also became a film. In it, a father survives a traumatic train accident as a young man in India.

""We have to go through that darkness, through that chaos and confusion, in order to ... ultimately figure out that the person we are today still has fragments of the person we were before we immigrated,"" says Ilan Stavans, professor of literature at Amherst College and editor of the anthology Becoming Americans. ""What immigrant writers have done in American literature is shown us that America is a microcosm of the world  that all cultures converge here  that we have connections, tentacles to the rest of the world, and that we are a society in constant movement.""

That movement is very much in the headlines today, and it was the subject of Sonia Nazario's Pulitzer Prize-winning Enrique's Journey. Nazario followed a young boy from Honduras searching for his mother in the United States.

""He travels the only way that he can  with little or no money  which is gripping onto the tops and the sides of these freight trains that travel up the length of Mexico. It's a modern-day odyssey that these children go on.""

It's a book of reporting written with a novelist's eye. ""There were gangsters that controlled the train tops,"" Nazario says. ""I would see these guys  they would roam from car to car and surround a group of migrants and say, 'Your money, or your life'  and strip you of your clothes, look for any coins they can find, and sometimes hurdle you down to the churning wheels below.""

Reza Aslan says part of what's fueling the stories of migration are a new generation of writers with roots in multiple parts of the world. ""When you have these writers who have these hyphenated identities,"" he says, ""they have the ability ... to draw from those cultures and to really get at the heart of what literature is about  how we as human beings navigate an indeterminate world; how we understand our place in this planet.""

More From The Book Your Trip Series For more great car tales, check out NPR's Book Your Trip series. We've got recommendations for literary travel by train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time machine and even giant peach.

And ultimately these stories of migration aren't really about the external journey. ""It doesn't matter the mode of transportation  whether by foot or by camel or by car or by plane,"" says Aslan. ""It doesn't matter the destination, and even the journey itself is secondary to the transformation that occurs in the individual making the journey.""

And even for the individual sitting still, reading about those journeys can become its own means of transformation.",[]

No, me neither, because I've been busy reading their compact, torn, slightly damp (how did it get that way?) board book to my own budding geniuses. Spoiler alert: Harold, a mere child, has left his bedroom. Don't worry. He ""think[s] it over for some time."" What's more, he has gone by way of an oversized purple crayon. Here's the thing you might not remember about Harold if a short human hasn't sat on your lap in a while  he gets into some real scrapes. Sure, there are the unlimited pies, and a trip to the big city, but there's also a dragon, a near drowning and a quick descent off a mountain. And here's the best part: Everything that scares Harold is something he created  that dragon may be terrifying but it's the dragon he hath made. Harold draws the sea that swallows him and the boat that saves him. And when he gets home again  who can be sure that the bedroom he's drawn, with the moon in the window, is the same one he left? It isn't, really  and that's OK. It's still home  even when something's changed  even when you've changed. And of course, the question that still haunts me: Is Harold going to step on the crayon when he wakes up? That purple's going to leave a mark on the carpet. (For ages 3 to 7)

In 1962, George Martin signed an unknown band: The Beatles. Steve Inskeep talks to Ray Connolly, who made a documentary series with Martin called The Rhythm of Life, about Martin's death at age 90.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

We are remembering Sir George Martin, who died yesterday at the age of 90. In 1962, while working for a British record label, he signed an unknown band called The Beatles. We're going to talk now with author and filmmaker Ray Connolly, who interviewed The Beatles many times and also made a documentary series with George Martin about music called ""The Rhythm Of Life."" Welcome to the program, sir.

RAY CONNOLLY: Good morning.

INSKEEP: Producer can be so many things for a musical group. What was Martin's job, really, with The Beatles?

CONNOLLY: He was the arranger. When they'd bring a song in, he's listen to it and say, well, you know, this is - this is OK. But have you thought about doing it in four-four time or maybe doing three-four time? That sort of thing - and then he would add all these instruments. He would sort of say, well, you know, that's great. But what else can you do? And then The Beatles would sort of throw out ideas themselves. So they would work in very, very close collaboration. The great thing about it was that George Martin knew everything there was to know about classical music. The Beatles knew whatever there was to know about rock n roll but nothing about classical music. So you put the two together - fantastic symbiosis. And so George took The Beatles from just rock n roll to ""Penny Lane,"" ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" ""Sgt. Pepper.""

INSKEEP: And added sophistication to the music, I would imagine.

CONNOLLY: Absolutely.

INSKEEP: What you're describing is the role of an editor, really, which can be psychologically challenging for the artist because Martin is the guy telling you your song is not right or your song is not complete. They must have really trusted him.

CONNOLLY: Well, yeah, at first, you know, they would do whatever he said because, you know, he was the boss. He was like a schoolteacher. And that's the way he came across all the time. He was like a schoolteacher. And he helped them. And then later on, of course, they wanted to have more say. In the end, when they finished - when they finished recording together, John Lennon - and actually John was being a bit mean about this. He kind of said, well, you know, we want to do it ourselves now. They weren't as good without George Martin.

INSKEEP: Did they resent it a little bit when there were stories suggesting that Martin was the guy who was...

CONNOLLY: Yeah, I think they did. I think John did. But then later on, he and George got together. And I remember George telling me how he'd been talking to John. And John had said, I wish I could record the songs again. George said, well, which songs, John? He said, all of them. But with George Martin doing it, you know.

INSKEEP: Oh, my goodness.

CONNOLLY: He was that important, you know.

INSKEEP: And when you listen to Beatles music, is there something - or anybody's music, really - is there something that causes you to say, that's George Martin? That's George Martin in there.

CONNOLLY: I can certainly do it on Beatle records because I know exactly what he did. On ""Penny Lane,"" played piano - he introduced the piccolo and the trumpet (ph), things like that. You know, if The Beatles hadn't met George Martin, they'd have been a fantastic rock 'n' roll band. Because they met George Martin, who would take them, you know, in other directions, they were much more interesting.

INSKEEP: Can I just mention there's something about Beatles music that feels timeless? There's so much music from the '60s that might be great music. But it's music from the '60s. The Beatles' music feels a little different to me. Was that George Martin's influence, particularly that classical music influence you mentioned?

CONNOLLY: I think it was partly that. I think, you know, rock 'n' roll is - it's American music. The Beatles took it further. And they made it English music - very, very English music. So you know, I mean, songs like ""Penny Lane,"" they are very English. And that's partly George too. I mean, when Paul sang ""When I'm 64,"" that was like an old-time English musical song. Well, George know how to do it, you know? Paul would say, well, what about this? And George would say, well, hang on. I've got an idea. At Abbey Road where they recorded, there was this sort of band room and these old instruments there. And the boys would bring things out and say, what does this sound like? And George would say, well, you can do this and do that with it, you know? Add a harpsichord here. Add this. Add that - you know? - fantastic.

INSKEEP: You said another interesting thing I hadn't thought about. We think of this British group that grabbed an American music style and even played, you know, old American tunes on some of their early records.

CONNOLLY: Yeah.

INSKEEP: But you're saying that Martin was the one who made them what they really were.

CONNOLLY: I think he was. I think he was. And I mean, The Beatles may say, no, we could do it without him. But I doubt it. I think George brought a hell of a lot to them.

INSKEEP: Author and filmmaker Ray Connolly, who knew George Martin for many years. Thanks very much.

CONNOLLY: You're welcome.

Martin, who died yesterday in London, was among the earliest to recognize The Beatles' talents and is often credited with helping them develop their sound. Originally broadcast in 1980.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. We're going to remember George Martin, the British record producer who's credited with helping The Beatles develop their sound. He died yesterday at age 90. Martin produced 13 Beatles albums between 1962 and 1970. He offered advice, created arrangements and helped them execute their unconventional musical concepts. Before working with The Beatles, he'd produced pop and comedy albums as well as symphonic and choral recordings. Martin was a classically trained musician and was the first to encourage The Beatles to use orchestral musicians on their records. I spoke to George Martin in 1980, back when FRESH AIR was a local radio program in Philadelphia. He told me that when he first started working with The Beatles, he wasn't sure about their songwriting skills.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

GEORGE MARTIN: They showed no evidence of being great writers to begin with - in fact, they weren't. After ""Love Me Do,"" I was convinced that they were a hit group, but I knew I had to find a hit song for them. And I was scrabbling around all the publishers looking at the material, and I eventually found something that I thought was good. And I gave it to them. I said, look, we're going to record this, and with this you'll make your fame and fortune. This will be a No. 1, I promise you. They obviously weren't too keen on it. It wasn't their song, but they did it. They had to. And the song was called ""How Do You Do It?""

And they made a very - well, quite a credible record of it. I've heard it recently. It's not bad at all. But at the end of it, they said, look, we don't really want to record other people's material for singles anyway. We don't mind putting one on our albums, but can we do one of our own? And I said smugly, well, if you can do something as good as that then I'll listen to it, but otherwise no. So they said well, give us a few days and see if we can come up with something. So they revamped ""Please Please Me,"" which they'd had before, but it wasn't quite in that style. And they said they thought they had something. And I said, OK, we'll go into the studio and make it, and we did. And at the end of the take, I said, gentlemen, you've got your first No. 1.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""PLEASE PLEASE ME"")

THE BEATLES: (Singing) Last night I said these words to my girl. I know you never even tried, girl. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you.

GROSS: Let's get back to the first tune that you recorded with them and that's ""Love Me Do."" The band right before that had had a different drummer than Ringo Starr. Who was the drummer and how did Ringo end up in the band?

MARTIN: Well, when I first met them and on the first tapes that I'd heard, the group was the three others and Pete Best - no Ringo. And Pete Best, in fact, was a very good-looking young man, a kind of sullen beauty about him. And he had a kind of James Dean-ish (ph) quality. But he wasn't too hot as a drummer - at least I didn't think so. And on the original tests, I said, you know, look, when we come to do our first single, I don't want to use Pete Best. I want to use a session drummer.

Well, unknown to me, the boys also felt the same way, and they were wanting to get rid of Pete anyway. So that my decision was a very convenient reason for them getting rid of him. So he got the boot. Poor Petey missed out on a fortune. And they looked around for another substitute, and they met up with Ringo who was playing in another Liverpool group. And when the next session came along, they bring in Ringo larger-than-life and say, well, our new member of our band. And I - aloof - said well, OK, I'll try him out. But I've got a session drummer I've already booked - Andy White. We'll use him if you don't mind. So we did a take with Andy.

And then I condescendingly allowed Ringo to have a go. And of course, Ringo was a very good drummer. And he quickly settled into the band. And in fact, his coming into the band was a kind of catalyst for the band. They kind of gelled then. They really got themselves together. And from that moment on, it was The Beatles against the world really.

GROSS: We're listening to my 1980 interview with George Martin, who died yesterday at age 90. Here's an excerpt of the interview in which we talked about producing The Beatles 1967 album ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" Martin told me that during the period those songs were written, John Lennon and Paul McCartney weren't - they weren't co-writing songs. They were each writing their own.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

MARTIN: By this time, they were writing quite different material. You could tell that - distinguish between their writings very easily. Contrary to most people's supposition, they very rarely wrote together. They did in the early days write ""From Me To You"" maybe together, but almost every song they wrote was a solo composition where the other one might help out with a word or two. And even though it's labeled John Lennon and Paul McCartney, looking back at it, you can easily tell which one's John and which one's Paul.

The Pepper idea only emerged after Paul had had this idea of writing a song called ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" which was a kind of jolly little jingle. And it was his idea I think, which suddenly turned it around saying, look, how about if we make the song sung by the band themselves as though it was an actual performance by this fictitious band?

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND"")

THE BEATLES: (Singing) We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. We hope you enjoy the show. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, sit back and let evening go. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It's wonderful to be here. It's certainly a thrill. You're such a lovely audience. We'd like to take you home with us. We'd love to take you home.

MARTIN: Really, the songs don't link up very well. I mean, there's no real reason why we should have such diverse songs on it. It was a collection of songs still, but I tried to make it a coherent whole. And when we started - when we finished all our basic recordings, I then tried to link the whole lot together by means of sound effects and running one into another and so on. It was at that stage where the record almost grew of its own. It was like a crystal. It seemed to have a life of its own. And during most of the recordings, the boys were going through their sort of druggie phase anyway. They were fairly high quite a lot of the time. I'm sure they didn't really realize what was happening, but it just did seem to involve almost of its own generation.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS"")

THE BEATLES: (Singing) Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies. Somebody calls you. You'll answer quite slowly, a girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

MARTIN: In ""Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!"" that song was built entirely around a poster that hung in John's house. You know how one decorates a house with odd things you pick up. Well, this was a genuine old circus poster, and on it were practically the lyrics of the song almost entirely as they are now. Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite, there will be a show at 10:15 on October the 27. The Henderson twins, Pablo Fanque's fair, Harry the horse - it was all down there. And he just wrote it into a song and came to me with it and wanted to do it, have an imagery of a circus. I always likened John and his songwriting - he had tremendous imagery. I regarded him not as being a drug person but more of a Salvador Dali of music. You know, he had a very free reining mind.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BEING FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR. KITE"")

THE BEATLES: (Singing) For the benefit of Mr. Kite, there will be a show tonight on trampoline. The Hendersons will all be there, late of Pablo Fanque's fair, what a scene. Over men and horses hoops and garters, lastly through a hogshead of real fire. In this way, Mr. K will challenge the world.

MARTIN: Obviously he wanted a calliope kind of sound. And I knew I needed steam organ sounds - you know, the kinds of things that used to be in fairs, fairground organs, which were driven by steam engines. And there were - and there still are - in existence many records of these. But they almost invariably play PD (ph) tunes, like ""Stars And Stripes Forever,"" and that kind of thing -marches. So I got a few of these records together. And I put them on tape. And I got the engineer. I picked out a few extracts. And I said to the engineer, OK, now, I want you to cut those tapes up into lengths of about a foot or 15 inches each. And having done that, he looked around - man, what do you want me to do with them?

I said, well, fling them up in the air. Of course, I was reputed to be eccentric anyway. SO he did just that. And now what do I do with them? I tell him, you pick them up again. And you put them back together again - but in whatever order it comes to. So he started tacking them all together. And he then quickly realized what I was on about. I wanted things to be in the wrong order. I wanted it to be jumbled - just a jigsaw of sound. And oddly enough, when he put it back together, a lot of the sounds were too much like the originals. So we had to turn things backwards - the odd bit here and there - and take it out and put it a few bars away. But we came up, eventually, with a hodgepodge of sound. It was just a kind of maelstrom of sound. It didn't - there was no particular tune at all. But it was calliope. It was steam organs, and it did give that sound. So I overdubbed that over the whole of the piece. You can hear it there, the kind of wish-wash background.

(SOUNDBITE OF THE BEATLES SONG, ""BEING FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR. KITE"")

GROSS: During that period and a little later on, a lot of people used to get high and play Beatles records backwards and listen for secret meanings.

MARTIN: Oh, yeah.

GROSS: Were there big secrets in those records?

MARTIN: There was - they were exactly what people - people found in them what they wanted to find. There was no messages. We'd put nothing in there. That was not intentional. At the end of ""Pepper,"" when we put it all together, we did two things which were in-jokes for us. One was to put a ridiculous amount of sound in the run-out groove and the other was to put an 18 kilocycle - kilohertz note on the end of it for dogs, we'd say, because poor dogs hadn't got anything to listen to. It was just an in-joke. We just did it for the heck of it. And the sounds that I put on in the inner groove, I just said to the chaps, the boys, all right, go down to the studio and do anything you like. Just sing anything or shout anything you like. And I just - they just do about five seconds of mumbo-jumbo, which really wasn't anything. And I lopped off two seconds of it and made a loop of it and put it on the run-out groove. Well, it so happened that people started playing it backwards and finding out all sorts of obscene messages, but it certainly wasn't intentional.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND"")

THE BEATLES: (Singing) I'd love to take you home.

For more than a century, mug shots have helped police catch criminals. Those photos of a person's face and profile trace their roots to Paris in the late 19th century.

Now, some of the earliest mug shots ever taken are on display at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The black-and-white photos were once on the cutting edge of how police identified suspects.

They were taken by a French criminologist named Alphonse Bertillon, and his techniques set the template that police use today.

Rise Of The Modern Mug Shot

Wilhelm Figueroa, director of the New York City Police Department's photo unit, says there are three parts of a mug shot the NYPD takes after arresting someone: the front view and both side views.

He estimates he has probably taken tens of thousands  and seen millions  of mug shots since he joined the department more than 30 years ago.

""No one looks like a criminal per se. There's nothing about a person's face that says, 'This person's a criminal,' "" he says. ""We're all capable of great good. We're all capable of being bad people.""

And profile mug shots are capable of helping police tell similar-looking people apart.

""Take 10 different people, take pictures of their ears and you'll be to identify each and every one of them because we all have different facets to our ears. Some of us have longer earlobes, some shorter, some thicker, some thinner,"" he says.

It's an observation that Bertillon championed back in the late 1800s. He went on to create a system for identification that the Paris Police Prefecture adopted in 1882, giving rise to the modern mug shot.

He wasn't the first to introduce mug shots to police, but he did standardize the way photos were taken and added the profile mug shot so police could zero in on a suspect's unique features.

""Men can grow facial hair to cover their chin, but you can't change the shape of your nose except through surgery. And you can't change the contours of your ear,"" explains Mia Fineman, one of the curators for the Met's new photo exhibition Crime Stories: Photography and Foul Play, which features some of Bertillon's work.

The mug shots were part of a broader system of measuring and comparing body parts to help police departments organize thousands of criminal records. In 1884, Bertillon's system helped Parisian police identify 241 repeat offenders. His work became so famous that in Arthur Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles, a client offends Sherlock Holmes by calling him ""the second highest expert in Europe""  after Bertillon.

A Mug Shot Legacy

His reputation, though, faded as more police departments learned that fingerprinting was a simpler way to identify people.

Still, his style of mug shots became the standard. Jonathan Finn, a police photography expert who wrote Capturing the Criminal Image, says he is ""still very much with us"" today in other ways.

""Whenever you go through an airport or at a train station and anything else and somebody asks to see your identification document, that all has roots in the late 1800s and the work of people like Bertillon and his contemporaries,"" Finn says.

Figueroa says he thinks of Bertillon whenever he comes across an interesting mug shot.

""It could be an interesting curve of the ear, a unique tattoo. It could be a unique port-wine birthmark,"" he says.

Even in an age of DNA testing and iris scans, he says he doesn't think Bertillon's photo legacy is going anywhere.

""A victim still records the person had black hair, the person had a tattoo that said 'Mom' on their right shoulder. We still live in a very visual world,"" Figueroa says.

It's one that may have forgotten about Bertillon's name  but is still holding on to his mug shots.",[]

Give Rolling Stone some credit for transparency. Sean Penns account of his trip to meet Joaquin El Chapo Guzman is topped with this editors note:

Disclosure: Some names have had to be changed, locations not named, and an understanding was brokered with the subject that this piece would be submitted for the subjects approval before publication. The subject did not ask for any changes.

Theres a good discussion to be had about the line between activism and journalism and how far across it the El Chapo Speaks piece goes. Lets set that aside for now.

This post is about two simpler issues.

First, NPR does not create pseudonyms for sources. Doing so gives the audience a reason to ask what else might have been made up. If we need to protect someones identity, we most often use real first names, sometimes real middle names, sometimes real street or nicknames that the source is known by and sometimes descriptions (the husband, the sister, the officer, etc.). Whatever we do, we explain it in our reports. We include the reason why the person needs anonymity.

We also pay attention to the donts of anonymity. That is, no attacks, no disguises and no offers. The Ethics Handbooks guidance on anonymous sourcing is collected here. Of particular importance is this guideline: Describe Anonymous Sources As Clearly As You Can Without Identifying Them.

Second, NPR does not show its stories to sources before broadcast or posting. Here is our guidance:

For purposes of accuracy and fairness, there are times when we may want to review portions of a script with a source or read back a quotation to ensure we captured it correctly. We may also play audio or read transcripts of an interview to a third party if the purpose is to get that partys reaction to what another person has said. Otherwise, however, the public is the first audience for our work  we dont preview scripts or stories in advance of their broadcast or posting with sources, subjects of coverage or other parties outside NPR.

i toggle caption Craig Sugden/CBS Broadcasting, Inc Craig Sugden/CBS Broadcasting, Inc

When James Corden took over The Late Late Show one year ago, the question on everyone's mind was, ""James who?""

He was big in the U.K. In the U.S. he had starred in the movie Into the Woods and won a Tony for the play One Man, Two Guvnors on Broadway. But beyond that, he was relatively unknown.

So it's kind of unreal that after just one year in the chair, his show has broken records for people watching on YouTube.

That's mostly thanks to a segment called ""Carpool Karaoke."" Corden drives along with celebrities, just the two of them  in a car with a few mounted cameras  singing along to the stereo.

The Late Late Show with James Corden YouTube

The video he made with Adele has been viewed more than 80 million times. He has also done Carpool Karaoke with about a dozen other pop stars, including Justin Bieber and Elton John. The Wall Street Journal called it one of the most successful YouTube franchises of all time.

My producer and I met Corden at his office on the CBS lot in LA where he films The Late Late Show. ""All right, let's light a candle, shall we?"" said Corden. ""Three open-minded, broad-minded guys kicking back with a candle, right?"" The candle has a masculine scent, like leather-bound books. Corden's T-shirt exposes his new temporary tattoo: Cookie Monster, courtesy of his young son.

Corden told me the idea for Carpool Karaoke came out of a segment he filmed with George Michael for a charity back in the U.K., but he couldn't get anybody in the U.S. to sing along.

Finally, he tried Mariah Carey. ""It was a chance meeting with a lady at Mariah Carey's record company, who was here in our office, actually,"" he said. ""And I pulled her in here, to this very office that we're sitting in now, and I played her the clip of George Michael singing, and I was like, it's joyful. And that's what people want, you want to see the joy in people, and you want to see the person that always dreamt of being a star, you know? You want to see people having a great time. So Mariah Carey is a huge fan of George Michael, she said 'if George will do it, I'll do it, let's do it on Sunday!' ""

Interview Highlights

On the reaction to the first Carpool Karaoke

The second person we did it with was Jennifer Hudson, and that went through the roof. And then there's just been a couple of moments where  we did the one with Justin Bieber, which kind of went crazy, and I think is at 65 million views on YouTube right now. Both Justin and his manager were like, ""that's me. That's the real me in that car, that's me who you're seeing on TV.""

The Late Late Show with James Corden YouTube

On whether Carpool Karaoke serves as a kind of image rehab for some stars

Sometimes you can have a reputation for not being relatable and nice because you had a bad day once. That's the thing. And I think that's particularly pertinent with Justin, because you just forget how young he is. When he gets in a car with me and I feel that about him  and I don't ever want to make a show which is snarky or trying to do someone over, or trying to make it about me, somehow. All I want is our guests to shine, because if our guests shine, our show shines, and if our show shines, then I shine. I don't ever want to come out and make anything about me ... and the whole thing is a collaboration, those carpools.

On whether he dreamed, as a child, of being a pop or theater star

Of course! To be honest, all I wanted to do, all I ever, ever wanted to do, I just wanted to perform. I just wanted to perform in whatever capacity, whether it was acting, singing, dancing, comedy  whatever it was, I just loved it and felt at my absolute happiest when I was performing for people. And if that's what you want from a job, then this is the best job you could ever do.",[]

On Friday night, I finally got to see Hamilton, the critically acclaimed musical I've been surprisingly obsessed with since Frannie Kelley's glowing write-up of the cast album last fall.

I say ""surprising"" because I am not a fan of musical theater, the kind of not-a-fan-of-musical-theater who pointedly self-describes as such should musical theater come up in conversation. But there I was, gripping my seat, as Leslie Odom Jr., the virtuoso who plays Aaron Burr, stood onstage by his lonesome in ""Wait For It,"" my favorite song in a show lousy with fantastic songs.

That number, all about frustrations and ambition and jealousy and doubt, knocked me on my ass the first time I heard it on the album,  like, wtf, do I actually like musicals now?  and the live experience was equally overwhelming. I'd read somewhere that Odom and other cast members regularly focus their attentions on particular audience members while performing, and I'm 95 percent sure that Odom was looking dead at me in the sixth row, as I mouthed along all the words to his song. Just two Philly dudes separated by a few dozen feet and a gaping chasm of musical ability sharing this moment of real connection.

I told my colleague/friend Stephen Thompson, who was with me that night, about this during intermission, and he joked that it was probably because Odom and I seemed to be the only black guys in the theater that night. We laughed, but it was hard not to notice that while Hamilton has been hailed for deliberately casting actors of color as some of America's most venerated Dead White Men, and ""reclaiming the American story ... for the people whom history habitually forgets,"" the actors onstage seemed to make up the majority of brown people in the house the night I went.

This is of course an unscientific study, based on me craning my neck and looking around the room, but three other folks who've seen the show recently tell me the audience was overwhelmingly white when they went, too. Yesterday, I asked folks on Twitter who've seen the show to share their experience, and many of them told me the same thing.

I'm avoiding making a too-obvious ""Great White Way"" joke here, but it seems these observations track with Broadway audiences in general; according to The Broadway League, the trade association for the Broadway theater industry, nearly 8 in 10 people who saw Broadway shows in 2014-2015 were white and in their mid-40s. (That's more diverse and a decade younger than NPR's audience, for the record.) About 80 percent had college degrees and about 40 percent had graduate degrees.

Now, I'm not arguing that black and brown folks ""should"" go to Broadway shows, and there is, of course, lots of theater, far from Broadway, that caters to audiences of color. But it's worth asking why this ostensibly uber-POC-friendly phenomenon isn't consistently pulling a notably black and brown audience.

A bunch of folks in the Twitter conversation yesterday suggested that who goes to Broadway shows is a simple matter of dollars and cents. James McMaster at HowlRound recently made a similar assertion about Hamilton, which you pretty much can't see without parting with a couple of hundred bucks:

The exorbitantly high ticket prices coupled with the perpetually sold-out status of the production prohibit most working class people of color from attending the show. Given that the production's audience, then, is overwhelmingly white and upper-middle-class, one wonders about the reception of the show's racial performance. How many one-percenters walk away from Hamilton thinking that they are on the right side of history simply because they exchanged hundreds of dollars for the opportunity to sit through a racialized song and dance? My guess: too many.

This is a compelling argument, but then again, nearly half a million folks book flights and hotels and tickets for EssenceFest in New Orleans each year. Then there's the mad rush a few weeks back for tickets for Beyonce's surprise tour. That is to say, there's a whole lot of pricey entertainment that people of color are willing to drop serious dough on, but Broadway shows like Hamilton don't seem to rate. Money matters, of course, but it's not the whole story.

When it comes to race and Broadway audiences, a big part of the story seems to be acculturation. Theater has a long history of segregated seating and plays chock full of racist caricatures that meant black folks, in particular, never warmed to Broadway. ""Theatergoing on Broadway is supported by families who collected programs going back 50 or 80 years,"" James Hatch, the co-author of A History of African American Theatre, told WNYC in 2012. ""Blacks did not have that tradition, and apparently still don't.""

That plays out today in the important, subtle social cues about who belongs. It's hard enough getting comfortable in a social space when you're unfamiliar with its rules and conventions. It's even harder when you're aware of how much you stand out. At Broadway shows like Hamilton, you get the honor of having that experience for a few hundred dollars. Even as Hamilton exceeded my impossibly high expectations, I felt a vague unease sitting there that night, like I was at a hip-hop show where my favorite group was performing, but I might get shushed for rapping along too loudly. (But c'mon, y'all: HERCULES MULLIGAN!)

Not being a regular theatergoer or a Broadway vet meant I didn't know exactly how to be in the audience. I was unfamiliar enough with the ritual and customs of that space to be worried that I might be doing it wrong somehow. Could that disconnect be keeping folks who might shell out comparable cash for Bey, even if it means traveling to another city, from doing the same for Hamilton? Something I've been chewing on, and sound off on Twitter if you think I'm wildly off-base here.",[]

Nurith Aizenmans piece today on Morning Edition is highly recommended listening.

Travon Addison, an athletic 25-year-old with short cropped hair, a wispy beard and tattoos all over his arms, takes her through the Sandtown neighborhood of Baltimore. I wont spoil it by giving away what listeners learned from Addison. You should definitely keep listening to the end. Addison is a compelling character. Nurith and her editors tell his story well.

There are two other things worth noting:

 We use Addisons full name. That isnt a minor detail. It helps the piece enormously. In stories in which key characters are not fully identified, we have to explain why. That takes time and can lead listeners to wonder what else that person might be hiding.

Nurith didnt do what reporters at some news outlets do too often. She didnt start with the presumption that Addison would want to use just his first name or perhaps even remain anonymous (because he had been arrested earlier in the week). She assumed he would be fully IDd.

That is NPRs standard. As we have discussed before, we name names and do our due diligence. Whats more, whether to go with first-name-only needs to be discussed and explained.

Nurith says another person she met in Baltimore  a white woman who was marching with protesters  initially wanted only her first name to be used in any story. The woman said she didnt want to call attention to herself. Heres how Nurith convinced the woman to give her full name: by pointing out that doing otherwise could have just called more attention to her and raised questions about why she wanted to cloak her identity.

 We seize the moment. As she headed to Baltimore, Nurith ran through in her mind the sorts of stories she wanted to tell and the voices who could be part of those pieces. Those characters included people who live in Sandtown and could talk about what happened last week and in recent decades.

Nurith heard Addison complaining about how he and others werent being heard from and how outsiders dont know anything about his neighborhood and why there were riots. So she asked him to show me your Baltimore.

It was a simple request that produced an excellent story.

npr.org,2016-03-08 00:00:00,'A Man Lies Dreaming' By Lavie Tidhar,[],"Unnerving WWII Noir In 'A Man Lies Dreaming'

Books that imagine a different version of the World War II era are as old as Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle and as new as Philip Roth's 2005 novel The Plot Against America. But few of these alternate histories are as bold and unnerving as Lavie Tidhar's A Man Lies Dreaming. First published in the UK in 2014, the novel is now out in the U.S., and it couldn't appear at a more unnerving time: As if mirroring our current election cycle, it depicts a right-wing politician successfully stoking the fires of xenophobia and bigotry. But in the case of Dreaming, the setting is London in 1939  in a world where the Nazis never rose to power in Germany, and the British Fascist leader Oswald Mosley is leading the race to become the new Prime Minister.

Oswald, however, is not the main character in Dreaming. Tidhar's choice is far more audacious: The book centers around Wolf, a down-and-out private eye in London who escaped Germany in 1933 when the communists  not the National Socialists  took over. It becomes clear very early on that Wolf is, in fact, Adolf Hitler.

Tidhar has handled reviled, real-life figures in his fiction before, most notably in 2011's Osama, and at first Dreaming feels like a reprise. Tidhar has other plans, though. The plot of Dreaming unfolds like a hardboiled detective yarn, with Wolf being hired by a mysterious  and Jewish  femme fatale to find her missing sister. At the same time, he takes on a second case for Oswald, whom he both admires and resents for capitalizing on the same anti-Semitic, nationalistic ideas that Wolf himself once spread. Wolf, at heart, is still the Hitler of our world, with the same virulent beliefs and lust for power: ""Give me a large enough lever and I would move the very world,"" he snarls in frustration, a would-be despot who was never given the chance to twist the world into his own image.

If that kind of alt-history speculation comprised the entirety of Dreaming, it'd be an intriguing read. But it's only the tip of Tidhar's iceberg. In a story that intersects Wolf's, a Jew named Shomer  hailing from our version of reality  is a prisoner at Auschwitz. He's also a writer of pulp detective stories. The interplay between the two storylines grows profound as they progress. Wolf's investigations take bizarre, grotesque, blackly comedic turns while Shomer's horrific existence grows symbolic  and then something magically more than symbolic  when the SS assigns him the task of making doors.

'Dreaming' is a book of big ideas, from the pathological origins of racist ideology to the way humanizing and dehumanizing those we love or loathe are flip sides of the same coin.

Like any good alt-history, Dreaming is exhaustively researched. A multitude of historical figures pop up in its pages, including many literary ones  among them A. A. Milne, J. R. R. Tolkien, Ian Fleming, and Evelyn Waugh. Some feel gratuitous and even distracting; others, like G. K. Chesterton and his notions of law and anarchy from The Man Who Was Thursday, feed into the thematic fabric that Tidhar weaves. Dreaming is a book of big ideas, from the pathological origins of racist ideology to the way humanizing and dehumanizing those we love or loathe are flip sides of the same coin.

Functionally, Hitler is the hero of Dreaming. Tidhar evokes a flesh-crawling sympathy for the most hated man in modern history while degrading him physically, emotionally, and sexually. He also paints a bloodcurdling picture of Auschwitz, where ""men die like smoke"" and ""women die like air."" Holocaust survivor Yehiel De-Nur  author of the infamously lurid House of Dolls  appears briefly as a character in the book, observing that ""this is an alien planet [...]. This is Planet Auschwitz."" A few pages earlier, Wolf is absurdly, hilariously envisioning how he might have brutally subjugated Oz if he'd been its dictator, all while grudgingly admitting to himself how much he loves ""Over the Rainbow.""

Tidhar tightropes between fantasy, farce, and historical fiction, all while grounding things in brisk, gritty noir. Parallels to our current state of affairs abound, but if anything, they're simply symptoms of how the past can recycle itself in frightening new ways  a process that Dreaming compellingly picks apart and rewires. History isn't written by the winners or the losers, Tidhar illustrates, but by those who know how to shroud it and spin it the most entertainingly. Which only makes Dreaming all the more chilling.

We're so stoked to be heading back to Austin, Texas this month where NPR Music will host the South by Southwest opening night showcase, featuring live performances by some our favorite artists. It's one of the most sonically diverse lineups we've ever had on stage at Stubb's Barbecue, from the crushing rock of Mitski and Alt.Latino favorite Chicano Batman, to the rising country singer Margo Price, funk and soul master Charles Bradley, R&B singer Anderson .Paak and rapper Vince Staples.

If you're in Austin we hope you'll join us for the showcase. It starts at 7:30 p.m. CT on Wednesday, March 16 at Stubb's. But we'll also record every performance and post them here on NPR Music soon after.

Here's a bit more about each artist:

Charles Bradley came up in the 1960s and '70s during the glory days of soul and funk, but, remarkably, never had a record deal or released an album until 2011, when he was in his early 60s. That's when Daptone records discovered him at a James Brown tribute show and signed him up for his debut full-length, No Time For Dreaming. He followed it with 2013's Victim Of Love. His third full-length, Changes, is due out April 1. Here's Charles Bradley performing live at the 2012 Newport Folk Festival.

Chicano Batman hails from southern Los Angeles, with a sound Alt.Latino host Felix Contreras describes as ""'70s Chicano funk."" The group plays retro instruments from that era but blends cassic Brazilian bossa nova and samba with soul and psychedelic rock.

Mitski will bring the noise to our showcase this year. The singer and guitarist, whose great new song ""Your Best American Girl"" we featured on this week's All Songs Considered, is an intense performer who shreds the guitar. This summer she'll release her fourth full-length, the potent and memorable Puberty 2.

Margo Price is one of the most exciting new voices in country music this year. Based out of Nashville, she was rejected by the major labels but found a home as the first-ever country artist signed to Jack White's Third Man Records label. Her debut full-length, Midwest Farmer's Daughter is due out March 25. We recently featured her single ""About To Find Out"" on Songs We Love.

YouTube

Anderson .Paak (the dot stands for ""detail"") has been working for more than a decade on a meticulously crafted sound that rolls hip-hop together with electronic music and '70s soul. But his voice didn't reach a major audience until he appeared on a half-dozen tracks from Dr. Dre's 2015 album Compton. As far as some fans are considered, .Paak stole the show. His sophomore full-length, Malibu, was released Jan. 15.

YouTube

Vince Staples will close out our showcase. We first heard the rapper from Long Beach, Calif. guesting on songs by Earl Sweatshirt. Staples' 2014 song, ""Hands Up,"" from the EP Hell Can Wait, was a searing, chilling indictment against police violence and corruption. He followed it with Summertime '06, last year's full-length debut on Def Jam and one of our favorite records of 2015.

NPR's Kelly McEvers talks to petroleum-geologist-turned-writer Rick Bass about the art of the short story, specifically his short stories. A collection of the short stories he's written over the years is called, For A Little While.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

The life of author Rick Bass is quite a story. He grew up in Houston and became a petroleum geologist. He would write on his lunch breaks. And then, in 1987, he moved to rural Montana and became an environmental activist. Since then, he's written dozens of books - nonfiction, novels, short stories - and won many awards. His new short story collection is called ""For A Little While."" It's a mix of old and new stories. Rick Bass says a short story is the best way to deal with the fast pace of life right now.

RICK BASS: The short story is a beautiful reservoir that you enter. You learn something, and you get out. It fits our brain. It's a unique package, a lozenge, a lens that helps us process all kinds of information. The classic short story form with that elegant, tapered shape - it's not formulaic. It's organic, and it fits who we are as a species.

MCEVERS: Like Rick Bass, many of his characters are off the grid and surrounded by nature. And many of them are incredibly lonely, and so I asked him if loneliness is the price of living so close to the wild.

BASS: I don't think it's the woods that make them lonely. You know, it's just the atoms bouncing around faster and faster. We're being called upon to respond, respond, respond - less downtime, less leisure time, less thinking time, less - no processing time. And when you're tired, you don't have energy for passion. When you're tired or overwhelmed, you don't have the resources to dream a big life, live a big life, and that can present itself in the form of loneliness - like, gee, I wish I had a community where I could just have a meal and sit down and talk for a while. Or I wish I had time to hang out more with my kids, or I wish; I wish; I wish. I think, again, it comes back to a question of time, really. I think time is the - kind of the factor here, and the loneliness - again, not landscape or externalities.

MCEVERS: It's interesting you talk about that because, you know, your stories are very languid, you know? They move at their own pace. Do you feel that they've gotten more so as you've sort of sensed this yearning and need for more time and space?

BASS: I would suspect so. That wouldn't surprise me. What I'm hungering for as a reader is the visuals, the reminders that the world is a beautiful place, and I'm just trying to bring, you know, almost a painterly illumination on sentences, on objects, on subjects. And so there is going to be more attention to the brushwork. And I think we're so hungry to have our five senses engaged-slash-re-engaged, that that's the best way to do it - is with sentences. And the stories will take care of themselves from those sentences.

MCEVERS: There's this one story. It's called ""Pagans.""

BASS: Sure.

MCEVERS: First, can you just describe what's happening in that story and tell us where it's set?

BASS: It's set in Texas on the Gulf Coast in the 1970s, a time of great cultural and sociologic change. The two boys and the girl - they're just navigating adolescence. They're navigating the interesting interface between friendship and romantic love, skipping school and going off and mucking around on the bayou in this really rich, fertile, lush environment that's got a lot of toxins in it from ship channel plumes and so forth. And...

MCEVERS: Yeah. I mean, they're basically playing with these pieces of machinery that have been sunk in the river. The river, you say, is poisoned. They've built kind of an altar out of kind of a pile of garbage, you know? And yet, to them, it is beautiful. I'm wondering if you could read a passage. You have the book, right?

BASS: I do, yeah. I'd be happy to.

MCEVERS: To set this up, the character's looking back. It's at the very end of the story.

BASS: (Reading) He wonders sometimes if there are not the ghost or husks of their other lives living still far back in the past or far below or even further out into the future still together and still consorting other lives birth from that strange reservoir of joy and sweetness and utter newness. And if there are, how does he access that - through memory, through imagination? Even now, he marvels at how wise they were then and at all the paths they did not take.

MCEVERS: The passage is so interesting. You know, it almost sounds like you're talking directly to the reader and this idea that there's another version of this story, and it's being lived out now.

BASS: Yeah, yeah.

MCEVERS: That, to me, seems like what must be the joy of writing - is that you get to think up those versions.

BASS: You're totally on it. And I would not have thought of it myself consciously, but it comes back to this idea of scale and time. You know, as a geologist, one of the mystifying and challenging things about mapping is, you know, unconformities, these vast stretches of settlement deposition that have been re-eroded, washed away. So you'll have an old formation, then the middle formation will be gone. then you'll have a younger formation on top of it. And there'll just be this missing chunk of, you know, 200 million years or something that - and you might find a few fossils down in another formation. And you might have a fault in truth that lifts up older rock up above younger rock. But there's a lot of stuff that happens that we never know about, yeah, you know, under the ground.

MCEVERS: And the fun is filling in the blanks.

BASS: It really is, yeah, and trying to connect dots from just a very few clues.

MCEVERS: Well, Rick Bass, thank you so much for your time today.

BASS: Thank you, Kelly. I appreciate it.

MCEVERS: That's Rick Bass. He's the author of ""For A Little While,"" a new collection of stories new and old. It's out now.

Recorded just before the duo's move to L.A., Dream All Over is a dusty piece of good-time rock 'n' roll that just wants to hit the open road. That's what appears to be the abstract narrative behind the video for ""Legends Of My Own.""

While Dylan Sharp normally shares vocal and guitar duties with Carrie Keith, Keith takes the vocal lead here on a melody that recalls Kim Wilde's ""Kids In America."" As a figure in a black hat gets busted on a deal, she sings, ""I looked familiar in a foreign land / I couldn't speak, but I could understand / From another life I rode / Into a desert of my own,"" like a drifter out to make the best of a bad situation.

Carrie Keith shot the L.A. scene on a ""Super 8 under the influence of the black sun,"" but from there, the story gets a little muddy:

Dececco came down with some silent concepts, and I had managed to acquire expired 16, so we shot with Mike Stoltz, and Nastassia plays the French shadow. I know Agnes Varda had been around, and she's often on my mind anyway. Late fall I was in Washington and went for a ride out to the coast with David Harris and Alex in her Cadillac, where we shot the color Super 8; some details I took from Melville, like the hat and overcoat against a cold background. The Camaro came back from Wyoming  my brother had souped it up  and my dad was running it around town, so we shot the two cars on a bridge over where the deal goes down.

CALLIE: Yeah.

SAGAL: OK, here is your first limerick.

CALLIE: Dad?

SAGAL: Dad, yes.

KURTIS: Yes, Callie, very, very good.

SAGAL: Very good, Callie. Lego want its toys - you know Lego, the toys - wants their toys to better reflect modern life. They've created a new figure called the stay-at-home dad. He comes with a baby, a stroller, an assorted tiny, tiny, tiny little miniature Lego bricks for him to step on and scream.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: It's a very accurate set. The mother who comes with it has a bottle to hand to the father to feed the baby. And she goes off to work in her professional-looking outfit.

FAITH SALIE: Is there a Lego breast pump?

SAGAL: There is probably.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So she's working, he's at home. I guess we know whose pants snap into the torso in that family.

SAGAL: All right, Callie, that was very good. He was your next limerick.

KURTIS: With my face to the screen, I'm a numb clone. All my texting and swiping makes thumbs groan. Which providers sell plans for a string and two cans? I will downgrade and get me a dumb...

CALLIE: Phone?

SAGAL: Yes, phone.

KURTIS: Phone...

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

KURTIS: ...How about that?

SAGAL: People exhausted by the constant flow of information coming out of our smartphones are now going back to more basic phones. It's the 21st-century equivalent of quitting your job and joining a commune, except you can still bathe regularly. For example, one company called Light Phone - it makes a simple handset, doesn't do anything but make and receive calls. You pay for that. For an extra hundred bucks, you can get a cord that goes right into the wall.

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: Do you remember when you had to use to uncurl the phone cords?

SAGAL: Oh, yeah, that was a big deal.

SALIE: Yes, I spent a lot of time doing that.

PAULA POUNDSTONE: What are you guys talking about? I still have phone cords.

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: Yeah.

SAGAL: Is your phone one of those you have to pick up one part, hold to your mouth and the other part you hold to your ear like that?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Calling Western Union, I need to send a telegram.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right...

ROY BLOUNT, JR.: All right.

SAGAL: Here, Callie, is your last limerick.

KURTIS: For millennials, time is ethereal, so our food choices are cafeterial (ph). See, the effort it takes pouring milk on some flakes is just too much work making...

CALLIE: Cereal.

SAGAL: Cereal.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

KURTIS: Cereal, Callie, 3 and 0.

SAGAL: We give millennials such a hard time. But as it turns out, they really are monsters. According to a survey of young adults that came out this week, millennials - people in their 20s - do not want cereal for breakfast because it is too much work.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: You've got the bowl; you have to put in the cereal. You have to add milk. Oh, my God. You're too exhausted to eat at that point.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: General Mills has responded. They're very in touch with their consumer base. They've unveiled new Millennios cereal. It's just Cheerios, but it comes with a large mama bird who chews it up and regurgitates it directly into their mouth.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Bill, how did Callie do on our quiz?

KURTIS: She did perfect without any practice at all, 3 and 0.

SAGAL: Well done, Callie, thank you so much.

CALLIE: Thank you.

SAGAL: Thanks for playing.

npr.org,,Gyrocopter Story Raises An Old Question: When Should Journalists Intervene?,[],"Gyrocopter Story Raises An Old Question: When Should Journalists Intervene?

The Tampa Bay Times knew well in advance that a Florida postal worker planned to fly a gyrocopter over Washington, D.C., and on to the grounds of the Capitol.

From what the Times has reported, there seems to have been no evidence that the man, identified as 61-year-old Doug Hughes, intended to do himself or anyone else any harm. Theres also a case to be made that the Times had reason to believe authorities were keeping tabs on Hughes. The Times knew he had been interviewed some months back by a Secret Service agent. That means Hughes was  in theory  on authorities virtual radar. (He wasnt, it turns out, on any actual radar this week).

It isnt the Times job, or the job of any news outlet, to be the police.

But, the many ways things could have gone badly on Wednesday arent difficult to imagine. Well set aside the Hollywood scenarios of fighter jets and missiles.

Still:

 Hughes might have fooled the Times and had nefarious intentions.

 He could have been shot.

 If shots were fired, bystanders could have been hit.

 People could have been injured during evacuations or as police responded to the scene.

At the very least, as happened, streets would be closed and traffic tied up for blocks around.

The Times reporter on the story tells The Washington Post that the news outlet spent hours and hours talking about the ethics of this, and decided there was no need to tell authorities well before Hughes planned launch. The Times ended up calling the Secret Service while Hughes was in the air, less than a half hour before he landed.

Media ethicists, as the Post notes, disagree:  A news organization should be extremely knowledgeable of the potential harm a stunt like this could cause, said Edward Wasserman, dean of the University of California at Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. I really question their judgment. 

News outlets dont want sources to think reporters will run to the police about just anything potentially illegal that theyre told about.

But how about this? Apply common sense and weigh the value of the story against the potential harm to the public. That will continue to be our standard.

This is already happening, but its important not to forget that as we line up experts for two-ways and interviews about public policy issues, we need to know if theyre connected to or publicly support one of the presidential campaigns. A standard question these days should be something like are you advising any of the campaigns? Or, have you been called by any of the campaigns or candidates? Or, are you publicly supporting one of the candidates?

Check with them about connections to public policy groups and advocacy organizations as well.

We look for expertise on a wide variety of subjects that are campaign issues. They include climate change, criminal justice, economics, foreign affairs, immigration, national security and tax policy. The list could go on.

A yes response to one of our questions doesnt automatically disqualify someone, but it is information we need to know, weigh and tell our listeners and readers if its decided that person should be part of our report.

Meanwhile, our responsibility doesnt end with a no response from the expert. Trust, but verify. Do some searches to be sure that person hasnt shown up in stories about economists who support Smith or historians who are advising Jones. The expert may have an explanation. After all, campaigns sometimes exaggerate their support and academics sometimes sign on to things without quite realizing what theyve done.

Its also important to know whether someone has advised candidates or groups in the past. That information may help put the experts thinking in context.

How far down the ballot do we need to go? Its wise to ask whether theyre connected to any House, Senate or statewide races. We would also want to know if an expert in a particular field has gotten involved in a specific story  the Flint water crisis, for example.

Whos at the organic smoothie shop? Pat or Korva? Whos the she? When will she get back with that smoothie?

We offer this presumably fictional and rather convoluted sentence because many of us arent careful about making sure that the pronouns we use are clearly connected to the antecedents they replace. Editors see antecedent/pronoun problems in copy every day.

Lets pick apart the opening scene. This is what was happening:

 Korva wanted the car started at 3:07 a.m., not 3:05.

 Pat was at the organic smoothie shop getting Korvas Mango/Kale/Chia Supreme.

 Korva would have to wait until Pat returned to tell her about the new starting time.

Strunk and Whites The Elements of Style offers this advice: The relative pronoun should come, in most instances, immediately after its antecedent. Note, for instance, how much clearer it reads to say Korva would have to wait until Pat returned to tell her. Just four small words separate the antecedent from the pronoun. Its clear that Pat is her.

Please also take care to pair singular pronouns with singular antecedents and plurals with plurals. Gender agreement is important as well, but bear in mind that the choice of pronoun may be a sensitive issue when the subject is a transgender person.

As expected, Hillary Clinton won the Mississippi primary. Michigan was the bigger prize and polls leading into the primary had Clinton up by double digits, but that's not how it turned out.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Voters delivered a surprise last night. Michigan gave a Democratic primary win to Bernie Sanders.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

He narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton despite polls that showed him far behind. That was just one result on a night when Clinton also won Mississippi, not to mention Republican wins for Donald Trump and also Ted Cruz.

INSKEEP: Let's focus on the Democratic results now with NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson, who's been covering all of this for many months. Mara, good morning.

MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning.

INSKEEP: Can you put last night's Democratic results into one sentence?

LIASSON: Yes. Bernie Sanders once again exposes Hillary Clinton's potential weaknesses as a general election candidate.

GREENE: OK, there's the summary. We're going to talk much more about that, Mara. But - and we'll expand on that. Let's hear a little bit from the candidates and also from some of their advisers first. NPR's Tamara Keith has been covering the campaign.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: If elections are about expectations and momentum, then Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders won the night last night. Hillary Clinton won the primary as expected in Mississippi by an overwhelming margin. But Michigan was the biggest prize. And polls leading into the primary had Clinton up by double digits. That's not how it turned out, not even close.

BERNIE SANDERS: I just want to take this opportunity to thank the people of Michigan, who kind of repudiated the polls that had us 20, 25 points down a few days ago.

KEITH: That was Bernie Sanders at almost 11 o'clock last night. He had given a speech hours earlier. But he was back to make a statement after it was clear voters in Michigan were making a statement of their own.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SANDERS: What tonight means is that the Bernie Sanders campaign, the people's - the revolution - the people's revolution that we are talking about, the political revolution that we are talking about is strong in every part of the country.

KEITH: In the final tally, Sanders won Michigan by 2 percentage points, a margin of about 20,000 votes out of a million cast. Exit polls indicate Sanders' message about international trade deals hurting American workers resonated with Michigan voters.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SANDERS: And frankly, we believe that our strongest areas are yet to happen.

KEITH: Sanders' campaign sent out a fundraising email celebrating the win and asking his supporters to pitch in just a little bit more. If history is a guide, this win will help Sanders raise millions of dollars in a matter of hours. And that money will help him compete and run TV ads in the next states on the election calendar - Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri and Ohio.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you so much. Hello, Cleveland. Hello, Ohio.

KEITH: Long before the results were in, Hillary Clinton, her campaign sensing Michigan wasn't going their way, spoke to supporters in Cleveland.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CLINTON: This will be a busy week here in Ohio.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And this campaign is about building a future where every American can live up to his or her full potential.

KEITH: For the Clinton campaign, losing to Sanders in Michigan is a speed bump, one they certainly would rather have avoided. But as Clinton's team sees it, this race isn't about momentum or expectations or even about wins. It's about delegates. And in that respect, Clinton didn't actually lose last night. She pulled further ahead. With her 66-point win in Mississippi and her close second in Michigan, she ended the night winning more pledged delegates than Sanders. As she spoke last night, it was clear that Clinton has one eye on Sanders but the other on Donald Trump.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CLINTON: Now, running for president shouldn't be about delivering insults. It should be about delivering results for the American people.

KEITH: The delegate math remains in Clinton's favor. But Sanders' campaign adviser, Tad Devine, says this is a marathon not a sprint. He described the campaign strategy over the weekend to Politico reporter Glenn Thrush in his podcast called ""Off Message.""

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, ""OFF MESSAGE"")

TAD DEVINE: We're going to try to beat her in pledged delegates. We think we've got until the end of the process to do that. We think we have - it's going to be hard. It's going to be tough. We know we have to win to get it done. But we think we can.

KEITH: And after their stunning come-from-behind win in Michigan, it's a whole lot harder to tell them they can't.

INSKEEP: That's NPR's Tamara Keith on the Democratic results from the primaries last night.

GREENE: And we were listening to that with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, who's still on the line. And Mara, Tamara just suggested the Clinton campaign is hoping that Michigan is just a speed bump. But you said a few moments ago that you see that state and Bernie Sanders' win exposing some potential weaknesses for Hillary Clinton. What are the weaknesses?

LIASSON: Well, I think that what it says is if she loses to a Democratic populist in Michigan, why wouldn't she lose to a Republican populist in Michigan in November? I mean, that's the whole Donald Trump argument. I can scramble the map. I can win in places that he says no, quote, ""normal Republican"" can win in. I can carry Michigan in the fall. I can do the same in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, et cetera. And I think it does expose her weaknesses. Populism is a very, very strong sentiment in the electorate in both parties.

INSKEEP: Now, in order to get to that general election for either candidate of course, they've got to win their party's nomination. And we just heard something interesting from a Sanders adviser that I want to translate. He said we're going to try to beat Hillary in pledged delegates. He's saying he wants to disregard these superdelegates, who have nearly all gone for Hillary Clinton and given her a huge advantage in the total number of delegates. Is it even mathematically possible, at this point, for Sanders' side to get a majority just of the pledged delegates and make some kind of a case at the convention that he ought to be the nominee?

LIASSON: Well, he has to win a very, very big percentage of the pledged delegates, over 50 percent, going forward if he's going to do that. And if he starts beating her in pledged delegates by large amounts, superdelegates will switch. We saw this happen in 2008, when Hillary Clinton was also ahead in superdelegates. But when Barack Obama started winning primaries, the superdelegates moved over.

GREENE: Mara, if you can, let's turn to one issue. I want to play you a bit of tape from a Democratic pollster, Margie Omero, who spoke to us a little bit earlier on the program this morning.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

MARGIE OMERO: I was surprised to see trade be so salient, frankly. It's something that's pretty complicated and dense and different for every voter and how they experience it. But it may be important, particularly in the Midwest. And the results from last night may portend what we are going to see next week in some of the other contests.

GREENE: Bernie Sanders' message - sort of talking about the downside of free trade seemed to really resonate with Democrats in the state of Michigan. Is that something that Sanders can try and capitalize on in other states in the Midwest and elsewhere?

LIASSON: Well, absolutely. I think this sets him up very nicely for Ohio. What he's saying is, now I proved that I can win in a diverse state. Michigan is a state where the Democratic primary electorate is more like the national electorate. In other words, it has a lot of white voters but not a hugely disproportionate number of African-American voters. He can say that the Michigan electorate is more representative than the Democratic electorate in, say, Mississippi or South Carolina or any of the Southern states where she wins by huge amounts. So I think this really sets him up well for Ohio. And I think it would give the Clinton campaign some pause.

INSKEEP: Now, let's bring in another factor here and also talk a little bit about the Republicans because you mentioned Donald Trump appealing to a certain kind of voter, Sanders perhaps appealing to the same kind of voter. Does Hillary Clinton have the same power was the question you raised. We're told that Sanders won white working-class voters in Michigan. We're told that Trump appeals to white working-class voters. The question is, who are those people really? Let's listen from earlier today to Republican consultant John Feehery as well as Democrat Margi Omero again.

JOHN FEEHERY: Interesting that both Bernie and Trump are going for those same voters. And I think that they're doing better than expected in both parties.

OMERO: You know, I cringe when I hear comparisons between Trump and Sanders. I mean, Trump is using just hateful language. I think it's something that Republicans should worry about. I think we should all be worrying about him becoming a nominee and what that means for our political process. Meanwhile, I don't think the same is true. Obviously, the same is not true for Sanders.

INSKEEP: What do the numbers suggest about whether Trump and Sanders really are appealing to the same kinds of people?

LIASSON: Well, I think there is some overlap. And I think this is what Donald Trump is saying he can do in the fall. He can say he can bring in white working-class voters who either have never voted before, have voted for Democrats or they're independents. And that's why he's saying that he can win in November using these same issues. Now, he is certainly not - doesn't have the same message as Bernie Sanders, is much more nativist, much more xenophobic. But he is trying to temper it. Every so often, Donald Trump tries to sound more unifying, note, less belligerent and, you know, with varying degrees of success. But that's clearly his general election strategy.

GREENE: Mara, heading into this night, I mean, we had - the stop Trump campaign in full force, led by Mitt Romney and others, seemed on its face to backfire. But if you are a Republican and you do not want Donald Trump to be the nominee, is there anything you can look to last night that would give you some sort of hope?

LIASSON: Not much. I think there were some glimmers of hope over the weekend. But the only thing I think a Never Trump person could look to is that now even more money - many, many millions of dollars - are going to be spent against him next week in Ohio and Illinois and Florida. And maybe that will be kind of the last experiment of the Never Trump movement, to see if this negative advertising actually does slow him down. But I think if you're a Never Trump person, you have to be looking pretty hard at Ted Cruz.

INSKEEP: Just one - just about 10 seconds here. And this is just one poll, but there was an NBC poll finding that all of Trump's challengers would beat him if it were a head-to-head race. Is there still a large ambivalence among the Republican electorate, not the leaders - in about 10 seconds - about Trump?

LIASSON: Well, sure because for every new white working-class voter he brings in, he turns off a suburban college-educated woman and energizes 15 Hispanics.

INSKEEP: OK.

LIASSON: And that's why there's doubts.

INSKEEP: Mara, thanks as always.

LIASSON: Thank you.

INSKEEP: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, talking through the Democratic results primarily last night.

NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Somini Sengupta, the former New Delhi bureau chief for The New York Times, about her book, The End of Karma: Hope and Fury Among India's Young.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Somini Sengupta left India as a young child in 1975. Thirty years later, she returned as the New Delhi bureau chief for The New York Times. The 21st century country she found as a journalist was nothing like the one her parents grew up in. Today, India is youngest country in the world with 365 million people between the ages of 10 and 24. A million turn 18 every month.

SOMINI SENGUPTA: They join the labor force. They register to vote. They embrace the Internet, many of them for the first time. They fall in love. And all those things change their own country profoundly.

SHAPIRO: It's a country with a democratic government, a country with constitutional guarantees. And that means it's a country with enormous expectations and challenges.

SENGUPTA: One is how to level the playing field so that there's at least some equality of opportunity for both men and women and, I would argue, particularly women who have really not enjoyed the equality that the Constitution of India had promised them 70 years ago. And the other related challenge is how much to let this generation speak their mind. India has always had a very ambivalent relationship with free expression, and that is all the more pronounced now during the Internet age.

SHAPIRO: Somini Sengupta follows seven young people and their aspirations in her latest book, ""The End Of Karma: Hope And Fury Among India's Young.""

SENGUPTA: I call this ""The End Of Karma"" because the people I write about - they're all trying to overcome their past. They were born with one destiny. They are trying to make another. And they're all stories of incredible grit and resilience and great hope but also a bit of fury - quite a bit of fury, which is why the subtitle of the book is ""Hope And Fury Among India's Young.""

SHAPIRO: And this idea of trying to overcome your past - how new is that for India - that your past is not necessarily destined to be your future.

SENGUPTA: I'll tell you the story of one child who I met in reporting this book. Her name what's in reporting this book. Her name is Varsha (ph). She was the daughter of what's known as a presswala (ph). Her family had a business pressing clothes at the end of a block under a tree. And ever since Varsha was a small girl, she would go around collecting the rumpled bundles of clothes, and she would help her parents pressing them - saris and salwar kameezes and button-down shirts. And the one thing she didn't want to be was a presswala or a presswala's wife. And she really, really wanted to be a cop, a policewoman.

And her father, who was her great champion, was also very much against this idea. He wanted to marry her off to a good family, and he couldn't bear the idea of her being a policewoman. So the story of Varsha is really the story of a girl who tries to overcome her past, who tries to grow wings and a story of a father who has to decide how far he will let her go.

SHAPIRO: Do you expect that five years from now she'll be a police officer or a presswala or something else?

SENGUPTA: I think it depends largely on how hard Varsha is willing to push. She has already pushed her father to go quite a mile. Her father did not want her to even finish high school or go to college. He was very nervous about what would happen to her, and she's managed to push him ever so steadily just by dint of determination and resilience. But she has also had to tamp down her dreams every step of the way.

SHAPIRO: So many of the stories in this book reminded me of stories we hear about early 20th century America. And almost the minute that thought entered my head, (laughter) I reached the sentence you wrote, this country is not a country of Horatio Algers, referring, of course, to the quintessential story of transcending destiny in early 20th century America. So while many of the stories do follow this model that the U.S. seems to have followed a hundred years ago, you're saying, no, there's a big difference here.

SENGUPTA: Well, I think the myth of Horatio Alger has increasingly been shown to be a myth even in our own country. But I think you're absolutely right that the parallels between India and the United States are just remarkable. India was a very unlikely country at its birth in 1947. It was made up of a bunch of different ethnicities, a lot of different languages. And frankly, there were a lot of naysayers who said there's no way that a country that is so poor, that is so diverse is ever going to hold together.

It did hold together, and it has made some remarkable gains since independence. My parents, who were born during the independence era - they're called midnight's children. In their time, life expectancy was 32, and today, it's 66. In their time, infant mortality rates were sky high, and now it's diminished remarkably. In my father's time, when he went to school, there were fewer than half of all Indian children who were enrolled in school. They certainly didn't include dalits or outcasts. They certainly didn't include many girls. And today, nearly all Indian children are in school.

SHAPIRO: Your parents, who, as you say, came of age in the era of Indian independence, were known as midnight's children, a phrase made famous by Salman Rushdie in his novel. You call this young generation noonday's children. Explain what that means.

SENGUPTA: This generation of Indians, because their expectations are so high, they are so demanding and so restive in many ways that I think of India at this moment as a country at high noon. And I'll tell you one story. I remember going out to a school in rural India in a state called Bihar. And it was wintertime, and it was early in the morning. It was a bright, sunny, crisp morning. The mist was rising from the fields. And all these children were just streaming into school, carrying these empty rice sacks because that's what they would sit on. There was not enough chairs or tables or benches for them, and so they would spread them out on the floor, on the grass outside of school, and they would try to get an education.

Now, I went there with a remarkable Indian NGO called Bhutan. They were trying to assess what children were actually learning in school. And as it turned out, half of all fifth-graders couldn't read a basic sentence. Half of all fifth-graders couldn't subtract. And these were children who had been in school for five years. And I'll never forget what one of the social workers who I accompanied - he said to me, you know, when these children grow up, they'll curse us. They'll say, we came to school, and we learned nothing.

SHAPIRO: And your commitment to these people whose stories you tell really comes across in the book where, again and again, I was struck by the number of times you would follow up with a 14-year-old as a 17-year-old (laughter) or an 18-year-old as a 21-year-old, not just tracking their stories but perhaps giving them career advice and helping provide perspective. You come across as very, very invested in these stories.

SENGUPTA: Well, thank you. I did get pretty close to all of these young people, some more than others. And I have to say, I had to resist giving the girl that I described earlier, Varsha - I had to resist giving her too much career advice because I did, at one point, consider giving her the form - the application form to fill out for the Indian Police Service. And then I stopped myself. I thought, well, you know, that's for her to do.

SHAPIRO: Somini Sengupta covers the United Nations for The New York Times, and her new book is called ""The End Of Karma: Hope And Fury Among India's Young"" - great talking to you. Thank you so much.

SENGUPTA: Thank you, Ari.

Please use the phrase temporary protective status, not temporary legal status, when referring to the provisions of DACA and DAPA.

Denice Rios advises that:

The term temporary legal status when it comes to DACA (Deferred Action for childhood Arrivals) ... keeps popping up and it isnt accurate. ... We all look for easy ways to describe complicated bureaucracy. But using the word legal even when preceded by temporary is problematic. DACA offers some benefits, like a work permit or a reprieve from deportation, but it doesnt offer all the benefits one would receive if one were here legally. Thats why temporary protective status or simply offering an example or two of what the actions offer are better ways to explain DACA and DAPA (Deferred Action for Parental Accountability).",[]

In Sunday's Democratic debate, the gloves came off between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. In tonight's Univision/Washington Post debate broadcast on CNN, don't expect them to go back on anytime soon.

i toggle caption Andreas Neumann/Courtesy of the artist Andreas Neumann/Courtesy of the artist

Given Iggy Pop's recent announcement that he may be retiring from the music business, it's been an introspective time for the rock giant. That might be part of why Pop's new album  a collaboration with Josh Homme  bears the title Post Pop Depression. Not that the album itself is quite as ominous as its name. Throughout its nine songs, Pop pipes in his most unctuous croon, a work of nature that's only become more monumental as it's eroded over the decades. But with Homme's acumen as the architect of Queens Of The Stone Age stirred into the mix, there's decadent ecstasy to the album that's as far from glum as you can get.

It is heavy, though. In addition to producing and co-writing Post Pop Depression, Homme provides guitar, bass, piano and backing vocals; also in the group are guitarist Dean Fertita (Homme's right-hand man in Queens Of The Stone Age, as well as Jack White's bandmate in The Dead Weather) and drummer Matt Helders of Arctic Monkeys. With that kind of lineup, it's clear that this isn't going to be any kind of retirement party, and Pop obliges his younger cohorts' zeal with plenty of his own. The album is all sharp angles and hard muscles, from the choppy, stomping riff of ""Break Into Your Heart"" to the splintered rage of ""Paraguay.""

""I have nothing but my name,"" Pop intones at the close of ""American Valhalla,"" his voice a study in smoke and gravel. For a man whose musical fortunes have seen many peaks and valleys  during some stretches of his long career, it has indeed felt as if Pop's name was all he had going for him  it's a chillingly vulnerable confession. But even when he lets out some morbid paranoia during ""In The Lobby"" (""My shadow is walking in front of me / And I hope I'm not losing my life tonight""), he seems more like a predator than prey.

Still, he never lets the album get too pensive. His spoken-word, expletive-laden, anti-laptop rant in ""Paraguay"" is the kind of get-off-my-lawn stuff that Pop has more than earned the right to unleash. But for every glimpse at the punk of old, Pop drops tender moments like ""Gardenia,"" a lush, catchy love song that's also ever-so-slightly eerie. The most sentimental moments, though, come when the band is clearly channeling Pop's high point as a solo artist: his collaborations with David Bowie in Berlin on the classic '70s albums The Idiot and Lust For Life. ""Sunday,"" for instance, unabashedly recalls that era with its skeletal yet punchy drumming, sculpted guitar and avant-garage edge.

In ""German Days,"" the record's most flagrantly nostalgic song, Homme and his team tap into the decadent, wiry menace of the Berlin albums while Pop glances back with rueful irony at Lust For Life: ""When your love of life is an empty beach / When it's painful to express the things you feel."" In lesser hands, that might come off as self-parody, but instead, the singer sounds like he's owning his legacy  and having a good time doing it, introspection notwithstanding. If Post Pop Depression does end up being Pop's last recorded hurrah, it's a worthy one.",[]

npr.org,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Wild Energy Flows Free In A Feminist Comics Anthology,[],"Wild Energy Flows Free In A Feminist Comics Anthology

Hot blue lightning seems to crackle, Star-Wars-Emperor-style, across the surface of The Complete Wimmen's Comix. Its title is a cheeky riff on the renaming passion that consumed feminism in the early '70s, and its two volumes come in a (actually rather ugly) salmon-colored box decorated with examples of the series' highly inconsistent artwork. The whole bulky thing feels like a suitcase bomb packed with jagged hunks of social revolution. And that energy keeps sparking throughout the 704 pages of this frenetic, anarchic, occasionally kamikaze production.

It's hard to think of an aspect of women's lives, real or fantastical, that Wimmen's Comix doesn't touch on. In 1971's ""Breaking Out,"" a cabal of female comics characters  including Little Lulu, Betty and Veronica, and Petunia Pig  rise up against sexist double standards. (Betty and Veronica picket outside the high school, demanding classes in karate and women's history.) In Joyce Farmer's 1975 ""Equal Rites,"" a dozen naked witches hold a birthing ritual to summon their forbears' spirits from outer space. Cecelia Capuana's ""Modemorphose,"" from 1985, shows women's bodies changing to reflect the strangeness of female fashion: The figures grow huge bottoms, uni-bosoms or multiple legs that stick out in all directions.

Many of the artists fantasize about crime. In 1976's ""Petite Morte,"" Joey Epstein envisions an all-woman street gang called the Tenderettes that rolls men for drug money  until one gang member develops a strange and lethal passion for their marks. In Melinda Gebbie's 1976 ""The Confectionary,"" a sex-starved woman holds up a couple, kills the woman and rapes the man. Sharon Rudahl tells of a woman helping her son escape from a Mexican jail in ""Jailbreak at Hermosillo.""

Some artists simply turn a wry eye on the mundanities of life. In 1988, Mary Fleener recalls her friendship with a self-dramatizing ""Trauma Mama."" In Teresa Richards' 1976 ""Chapstick,"" a woman fantasizes a steamy, explicit tryst on an elevator, then settles down to watch ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.""

It's genuinely painful to imagine the radical, clashing perspectives that might have been found in these pages if the collective had only reached out to more women of color.

It may be hard to see how ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"" and female-on-male rape can find homes in the same publication. But there's a strong, common current of energy unifying Wimmen's Comix. That's partly because some feminist issues, like abortion, are as fraught today as they were back in 1971. It's also because the collective seems to have remained mostly white, as far as can be judged from the photos in the introduction and the skin tone that predominates in the comics. It's genuinely painful to imagine the radical, clashing perspectives that might have been found in these pages if the collective had only reached out to more women of color.

They did reach out to a huge number of contributors  apparently regardless of artistic talent. The artwork is a total grab bag, ranging from the polished creations of Rudahl, Trina Robbins, Phoebe Gloeckner and Dot Bucher to painfully amateurish doodles by creators better left unnamed. Mixed in is subversive work in which wild, even ugly scrawls evoke an unnerving sense of chaos (Dori Seda, Diane Noomin and the perennially obstreperous Aline Kominsky-Crumb). There's even the occasional contribution from a soon-to-be-notable name (Lynda Barry, Alison Bechdel, Julie Doucet).

There's one more reason for the unity of spirit in Wimmen's Comix: These these artists, all clearly in agreement that ""the personal is political,"" are much more comfortable with the first half of that pairing. They do tackle equal pay for equal work in the publication's early years and AIDS in later ones, with a dizzying assortment of topics in between. Rape, prostitution, sexual harassment, vegetarian cooking, science fiction, gothic romances, socks, bondage, nuns, farting, motorcycles and magic all feature in these pages. There are feminist fairy tales, stories of Harriet Tubman and Julia Pastrana, the Ugliest Woman in the World, a board game, and a pointillist study of a cervix. There's even a 3-D issue (glasses included).

Still, though, these comics largely stick to the personal, to relationships and fantasies and the absurdities of everyday life. Whether it's 1971 or 1989, the contributors' favorite topics are self-definition and men, men, men. (Not to mention sex, sex, sex. Everyone is doing it in these pages, including cats and bugs.)

The new HBO series Vinyl explores the seedy underpinnings of the music business in the 1960s and '70s. The show, whose executive producers include Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, has been resurrecting and recreating great songs from those days in each Sunday night episode. One of the exciting ""cover"" tunes done for next week's show is ""Watch Your Step,"" an R&B song made famous by Bobby Parker in the summer of '61. Here it's covered by The Arcs. When we asked Dan Auerbach why the band played this song, he answered in a way that mimics the show: ""What Marty wants, Marty gets.""

""Watch Your Step"" is a tune whose influence  in particular Parker's guitar line  would be heard again and again in music in the early '60s, particularly in George Harrison's guitar line to The Beatles ""I Feel Fine"" and Jimmy Page's performance on Led Zeppelin's ""Moby Dick."" The song was a moderate hit in the U.K.

There's an 18 track collection of songs from the series that came out when the show launched, but Vinyl also has a series of mini soundtracks it releases each Friday tied to Sunday's episode. Along with The Arcs, here's what's on this week's show, and available as EP Volume 1.5.:

1) Rosco Gordon  Let's Get High

i toggle caption Geoff Robbins/AFP/Getty Images Geoff Robbins/AFP/Getty Images

The remaining four Republican candidates debate once again tonight in Miami. Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich will be on the stage together for the last time before next Tuesday's big primary night when voters in Ohio and Florida  Rubio and Kasich's home states  go to the polls. Tuesday is a make or break night for the two of them and tonight's debate is the last chance they have to change the dynamic in a race that has not been going their way.

Here are four things to watch  one for each candidate.

1. How will Trump behave?

Lately the front runner has been trying to appear more ""presidential,"" holding press conferences instead of rallies after his primary wins to project more gravitas. In the last debate, he announced that he was flexible and would change his positions if necessary in order to break the gridlock in Washington. But that was just minutes before  and after  he talked about the size of his hands and a certain part of his anatomy. So we're not sure which Trump will show up tonight  the one who calls his opponents stupid, fat, losers, or the one who promised on Tuesday night: ""I can be more presidential than anybody other than the great Abe Lincoln. He was very presidential, right?""

2. Does Cruz punch up or down?

Cruz is in the number two spot  only about 100 delegates behind Donald Trump. He has the strongest case to make that if the nominee is not going to be Trump, it should be him. Some establishment Republicans in the #nevertrump movement are coming around to the idea that as much as they dislike Cruz he might be their only choice. Lindsay Graham, no fan of Cruz's, says it may be time to rally around the Texas senator. Still, Cruz has a total of ZERO endorsements from his fellow senators.

Tonight, does Cruz use his formidable debating skills to try again, to cut Trump down to size, or does he attack Rubio and Kasich, whose continued presence in the race prevent him from consolidating the anti-Trump vote?

3. Rubio on the ropes

Now that Jeb Bush has left the race, Rubio has become Trump's preferred punching bag. Rubio tried undermining Trump with insults but that didn't work. Trump needled him about this on Tuesday night, helpfully pointing out that, ""hostility works for some people . It doesn't work for everybody, O.K.? ""

Rubio has the most to lose next week. If he doesn't win his home state of Florida, he will not only give up any shred of viability as a candidate, he could also hurt his political career going forward. Unlike Cruz and Kasich, who have day jobs they can keep, Rubio gave up his Senate seat to run for president and is not running for reelection in the fall.

4. Kasich needs to win something

Kasich has an even worse record in this primary than Rubio, who won in Minnesota and Puerto Rico. Kasich hasn't won anywhere. Tuesday was a disappointment for Kasich. He came in third in Michigan, which is a rust belt state like his own Ohio. Kasich once had hopes of winning there or placing a strong second.

Trump is beating him in the polls in Ohio and Kasich has said that if he doesn't win his home state he's done. So, tonight, what does Kasich do to claw his way back into contention? Does he continue his ""Mr. Nice Guy"" strategy, showing voters that he's a reasonable, not very partisan, not very angry candidate who is as fed up with the antics of his opponents as they are? Or does he actually try to take on Trump?

Granted, that hasn't worked for anyone else but there's not much time left.",[]

i toggle caption Elise Tyler/Courtesy of the artist Elise Tyler/Courtesy of the artist

""I went looking for a new direction / Indecisive, undecided,"" Damien Jurado sings in ""Onalaska,"" one of the eeriest tracks on his new album, Visions Of Us On The Land. He's singing in character; there's nothing remotely indecisive or undecided about Visions. His direction, though, is indeed pretty new. The album is the final installment of a loose trilogy Jurado began with 2012's Maraqopa and continued on 2014's Brothers And Sisters Of The Eternal Son. This time around, he's delivered a sprawling, 17-song story arc that picks up where Brothers left off  that is to say, somewhere near the edge of terra incognita. After a car crash sends the trilogy's unnamed protagonist on some hazy kind of metaphysical odyssey, he's arrived at a state of existential bemusement, searching his psyche for answers. It's a heady concept, for sure, but one that Jurado anchors in gorgeous songwriting and lush, layered indie-folk arrangements.

That said, Visions isn't folky in a heart-on-the-sleeve kind of way. Jurado's no stranger to sad, sparse songs  he built his early career on them  but on Visions' ""Sam And Davy,"" for instance, he forgoes the acoustic confessional in favor of something far grander. Not to mention bleak: With minor chords, booming bass-drum detonations and menacing flourishes of synth, Jurado yanks the wheel and forces a detour into the depths of psychedelic reverie, asking, ""Does your blood run cold / Or your eyes go white / On a borrowed soul / And on borrowed time?"" In ""Prisms,"" Jurado channels one of his longtime heroes, Nick Drake; a more skeletal, guitar-plus-vocal track, it ponders the nature of memory as Jurado sings, ""Do we still go on / Long after rewind?"" His voice is so ghostly and echoing, it answers his own question.

Things don't exactly get upbeat from there  although ""Exit 353,"" the first song he wrote for the album, has more of a left hook to it. A propulsive, chillingly lonely dirge spiked with a distorted, tooth-rattling guitar riff, it contains yet another unsettling question (""Are we all not lost in song?"") whose response is self-evident. And in ""A.M. A.M.,"" Jurado's singsong, reverb-cushioned melody is as plush as it is haunting. Richard Swift, an accomplished singer-songwriter in his own right, once again provides the assist as both producer and guest instrumentalist; his shadowy atmospherics stand out in ""Mellow Blue Polka Dot,"" a cooing, catchy shuffle that recalls Bill Callahan's dark pop explorations.

Jurado has been playing the long game with his trilogy of albums, but the story arc doesn't come to a satisfying conclusion  nor should it. After the fingerpicked, Dylan-esque hush of ""Orphans In The Key Of E,"" Jurado wraps up the album with a glance over the shoulder: ""When I look back upon my time, see the snapshots of my life,"" he sings, ""You will not be surprised to see your name across my smile."" It's a small, welcome moment of sentimental peace, but it's fraught with its own ominous sense of loss as the refrain of ""I will remember you / The way you are right now"" begins to sound more like a fading distress signal than a comfort. As works of mood-altering music go, Jurado has upped the dosage with Visions. It's a harrowing trip, led by a guide who's all too familiar with the territory.",[]

On how ISIS challenges American Muslims to think more critically

ISIS preys on our inability to walk and chew gum at the same time. It's making us think more critically. It's making us look critically at the way our media tells stories about how this happens. It's making us think and look critically at American foreign policy. It's making us think and look critically at the way we construct Islam in America.

On how ISIS thrives on ignorance and lack of critical thinking

ISIS is not doing these things just nilly-willy. They're very methodic. So as a Muslim if you go and you try to refute them, you're likely going to fail, because they'll be quoting scripture, sayings of the Prophet, historical events from early Islam. And most Muslims don't have that. They're not equipped with the proper knowledge, and so ISIS thrives on our own ignorance and our lack of critical thinking.

On the growth in both extremism and atheism

On one extreme, you have the yahoos, right? And they're going to go and be attracted by that rhetoric. Then on the other side you have the regular Muslims, and they're just, maybe they're not feeling it anymore. I mean, I know, personally, I get emails all the time, people doubting their faith.

On how Muslims need to make religious literacy a top priority

North Carolina voters are likely to be confused when they arrive at the polling place on March 15th. In addition to presidential candidates, voters will see congressional primary candidates on the ballot.

But thanks to a federal court decision, the districts those candidates represent no longer exist and any voters in those races won't count.

Thanks to three judges, two animal shapes and one hastily redrawn map of U.S. House seats, North Carolina politics have been thrown into chaos.

It started to go off the rails on February 5th when a panel of three federal judges determined that the boundaries of the state's 1st and 12th congressional districts were drawn in such a way to concentrate African American voters and dilute their overall influence.

Coming just five weeks ahead of voting, there was no choice but to ""Stop the current election, go back, redraw the lines,"" said Josh Lawson, general counsel for the North Carolina State Board of Elections.

Redrawing The Animal Shapes

If you're not familiar with North Carolina's congressional map, here's where the animals shapes come into play.

The 1st District looks kind of like an octopus, whose body hugs the Virginia border and whose tentacles stretch east and west and halfway down the state.

The 12th congressional district is more snake-like  sometimes no wider than the span of an interstate - and extends more than 80 miles from Charlotte to Winston-Salem.

The federal court decision surprised many in the state, especially because the U.S. Department of Justice approved the maps five years ago.

Faced with the court order, the state's Republican legislature opted for a drastic redrawing of North Carolina's entire congressional map, finishing the job in just two weeks.

""Eleven out of the 13 districts saw major changes,"" said Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College. ""Some sitting members of Congress woke up the next morning after these maps had been released and went, 'oh boy, I don't even live in the district now.'""

In fact, the home of U.S. Rep. Alma Adams (D-NC) in the old, snaking 12th District is two hours away from the borders of the newly-redrawn, short and squat 12th District.

Most of the other districts were also stretched or shifted, which means that ""lots of folks now have different representation than they did before,"" said Lawson.

Primary Chaos

The process has created a host of logistical hurdles for elections officials in North Carolina, starting with a process known as geo-coding to determine who represents every voter in the state. Next, officials need to reprint more than 4,5000 different types of ballots. And then there's the question of who's ON the ballot.

""Under the current map 46 people are currently running for Congress, but that number would be expected to grow substantially,"" said Lawson, because the state has reopened the filing period to allow more candidates to run in the newly-drawn districts.

All of this takes time  so state lawmakers moved the primaries for U.S. House races from March 15th to June 7th.

However, the March 15th ballots have already been printed and they include congressional candidates. So election officials have urged North Carolina voters to fill the entire ballot out - even though votes for U.S. House candidates won't be counted.

It's an effort to tamp down confusion although telling voters to cast votes in a non-existent race is a situation that Lawson admits he did not foresee.

The federal judges who threw out the original congressional map still have to approve the one drawn by the state lawmakers. If the judges reject it, they can tell the legislature to redraw the map or the judges will redistrict the state themselves.",[]

YouTube

Carolina Chelele is a contestant on a popular reality TV show. But it's not about dating, housewives or survival. It's about ... farming. Specifically farming by females.



She and her competitors have each been given a bag of mortar and a single seed. The cameras are rolling. Thousands of dollars in prizes are on the line. The producers ask them: How do you plant it?

Ready? Set? Go!

Some farmers planted the seed directly in the mortar (in case you're not sure what mortar is, it's a mix of sand and cement). Others mixed the mortar with soil or mud. But Chelele, 49, sat back. She didn't touch the stuff.

""This challenge is impossible,"" she said.

She was correct, of course  you can't plant a seed in mortar. Water would just make it harden and set around the seed, which would have no room to grow.

Chelele's agricultural smarts (and common sense) helped her beat 14 other women farmers and win season 5 of Tanzanian's Female Food Heroes last August.

The show, sponsored by the international charity Oxfam, was created to show Africans just how valuable hard-working, experienced women farmers like Chelele are  even though they're not reaching their full potential.

Women make up 53 percent of Tanzania's small crop producers, but produce, on average, 14 percent fewer crops per acre than plots managed by men  which means they earn less money. This is because they lack access to credit, labor and fertilizer, factors essential to productivity, according to a report from the One Campaign and the World Bank.

Despite the serious subtext, Female Food Heroes takes a lighthearted approach. The farmers compete in all kinds of tasks over a 21-day period: selling goods on the side of the road, repairing mud walls and vaccinating goats. Viewers help determine the winner by voting for their favorite contestants.

Since the TV version of the program, Mama Shujaa wa Chakula, began airing in Tanzania in 2011, the show, in partnership with East Africa TV, has reached about 37 million viewers throughout the region, says Oxfam. And each season, nearly 3,000 female farmers vie for one of the 18 to 20 spots on the TV show.

The idea for the initiative came about after campaigners at a regional Oxfam meeting in Africa decided they needed to change how people were talking about female farmers. ""A lot of what we were doing for smallholder women farmers wasn't having an impact,"" says Eluka Kibona, who manages Oxfam's involvement with the show.

They wanted less of a ""pity party"" and more of a ""celebration that would give them the status they deserve,"" she adds.

And that's exactly what the program is doing: transforming African women farmers into advocates for agriculture issues.

Chelele, who won season five of Female Food Heroes in Tanzania, has become a community leader. In addition to the grand prize, which included about $10,000, 7 acres of land, and farming and fishing tools, she says in an email to NPR that she has ""generated a small amount of fame, which is wonderful.""

Now that she's a winner, the mother of four and the sole provider for her household educates people and family members in her village about different farming methods. A few times a month, she goes on the local radio station. People call in and ask her about her experiences as a farmer and a women's rights advocate. She answers questions like ""How do I learn to make manure?"" ""How did I modernize my farming technique?"" and of course, ""How do I get on the show?""

Since the television show began in Tanzania, Female Food Heroes competitions and award ceremonies  which Oxfam describes as kind of like a ""beauty pageant""  have been held in Ethiopia and Nigeria. But the program, which started in 2012, has its own set of winners, judges and contestants. Unfortunately, it's not aired on TV.

The contestants don't seem to mind  they're just glad they have a chance to win. Monica Maigari, an energetic 59-year-old farmer, was the first-runner up in Nigeria's 2014 Female Food Heroes challenge.

On top of winning $1,000, which she used to buy land, there are other perks. She's currently in Washington, D.C., helping Oxfam lobby Congress on U.S. legislation to improve global humanitarian response and give local groups the tools and resources they need to act when disaster strikes  an idea that Maigari can stand behind.

And now that she's become a leader in her village  where ""even the men"" respect her, she says  she will use her power to help women farmers. She wants them to learn how to read and write, learn how to use the machines that will pack their food in containers for supermarkets, and get their foodstuffs registered and vetted in Nigeria's version of the FDA.

Don't even get her started on mangoes. ""They drop down and we cannot preserve them, they just go to waste,"" she says. ""It's a serious problem. They rot and we cannot sell them at the market.""

Maigari, who visited NPR this week, noticed our building's rooftop garden, looking pretty dead thanks to winter, and happily gave us some good advice.

She likes that our box garden is ""well-manured,"" and says it would be great for carrots, tomatoes and spinach. But no more than four kinds of crops, she says  that way NPR can ""grow enough to sell at the market.""",[]

American intelligence officers are trained to tackle tough targets.

But there are tough targets, and then there's Russian President Vladimir Putin, who plays his cards so closely that it's hard for his own advisers to divine what he's thinking, says Gregory Treverton, chairman of the National Intelligence Council.

""Putin is so isolated that the chances that he might miscalculate and do something rash are top of my list for things I worry about,"" says Treverton. ""I am fond of distinguishing between puzzles  those things that have an answer, though we may not know it  and mysteries, those things that are iffy and contingent. And so how Putin is going to behave is presumably a mystery, and probably even a mystery to Putin.""

Treverton is not alone in this view.

Retired Adm. James Stavridis, commander of NATO forces from 2009 to 2013, says Putin is exceptional in how little he telegraphs.

""He certainly has a cabinet of close advisers,"" Stavridis says.""But at the end of the day, the strategic terrain is not on a map somewhere  it's in between Vladimir Putin's ears.""

That makes it hard for the CIA and other spy agencies charged with tracking Russian military and economic assets  and with anticipating what Moscow might do next on the conflict in Syria, tensions in Crimea and a wide range of other matters.

Stavridis, now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, points to a couple of factors that make Putin such a difficult target.

One is the degree of control he has amassed in his 17 years as either prime minister or president of Russia. You have to look to North Korea, Stavridis says, or to Fidel Castro's long reign in Cuba to find another ruler who wields such absolute power.

The tools of espionage  phone intercepts, satellite imagery and more  can sometimes overcome such disadvantages, but may be of limited use against Putin: He's a trained spy himself.

Vladimir Putin joined the KGB in 1975, and was sent to Dresden in East Germany in order to spy on the West during the Cold War. There he learned both near-flawless German and near-flawless spycraft.

""Russia has always had a very strong counterintelligence capability, and Putin would be well-schooled in this,"" says John McLaughlin, who served as acting director of the CIA in 2004, during Putin's first stint as president. McLaughlin says the aides in whom Putin might confide are mostly ex-KGB, too. ""The inner circle there would be very conscious of how they communicate, conscious of who meets whom. So it's a tough environment for intelligence.""

But McLauglin adds that if you can't peer into Putin's mind, you still can analyze the realities he's grappling with, which may inform his actions.

""In the case of Russia, you would look at the effect of sanctions, which have been very heavy on them,"" McLaughlin says. ""The fact that the ruble is now at kind of an all-time low, the fact that they have a serious capital-flight problem.""

There's also the fact that Putin has spoken openly about his overarching goal of re-establishing Russia as a major world power. It's up to the CIA and other spy agencies to figure out how he plans next to go about it.",[]

The new HBO series Vinyl explores the seedy underpinnings of the music business in the 1960s and '70s. The show, whose executive producers include Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, has been resurrecting and recreating great songs from those days in each Sunday night episode. One of the exciting ""cover"" tunes done for next week's show is ""Watch Your Step,"" an R&B song made famous by Bobby Parker in the summer of '61. Here it's covered by The Arcs. When we asked Dan Auerbach why the band played this song, he answered in a way that mimics the show: ""What Marty wants, Marty gets.""

""Watch Your Step"" is a tune whose influence  in particular Parker's guitar line  would be heard again and again in music in the early '60s, particularly in George Harrison's guitar line to The Beatles ""I Feel Fine"" and Jimmy Page's performance on Led Zeppelin's ""Moby Dick."" The song was a moderate hit in the U.K.

There's an 18 track collection of songs from the series that came out when the show launched, but Vinyl also has a series of mini soundtracks it releases each Friday tied to Sunday's episode. Along with The Arcs, here's what's on this week's show, and available as EP Volume 1.5.:

Given Iggy Pop's recent announcement that he may be retiring from the music business, it's been an introspective time for the rock giant. That might be part of why Pop's new album  a collaboration with Josh Homme  bears the title Post Pop Depression. Not that the album itself is quite as ominous as its name. Throughout its nine songs, Pop pipes in his most unctuous croon, a work of nature that's only become more monumental as it's eroded over the decades. But with Homme's acumen as the architect of Queens Of The Stone Age stirred into the mix, there's decadent ecstasy to the album that's as far from glum as you can get.

It is heavy, though. In addition to producing and co-writing Post Pop Depression, Homme provides guitar, bass, piano and backing vocals; also in the group are guitarist Dean Fertita (Homme's right-hand man in Queens Of The Stone Age, as well as Jack White's bandmate in The Dead Weather) and drummer Matt Helders of Arctic Monkeys. With that kind of lineup, it's clear that this isn't going to be any kind of retirement party, and Pop obliges his younger cohorts' zeal with plenty of his own. The album is all sharp angles and hard muscles, from the choppy, stomping riff of ""Break Into Your Heart"" to the splintered rage of ""Paraguay.""

""I have nothing but my name,"" Pop intones at the close of ""American Valhalla,"" his voice a study in smoke and gravel. For a man whose musical fortunes have seen many peaks and valleys  during some stretches of his long career, it has indeed felt as if Pop's name was all he had going for him  it's a chillingly vulnerable confession. But even when he lets out some morbid paranoia during ""In The Lobby"" (""My shadow is walking in front of me / And I hope I'm not losing my life tonight""), he seems more like a predator than prey.

Still, he never lets the album get too pensive. His spoken-word, expletive-laden, anti-laptop rant in ""Paraguay"" is the kind of get-off-my-lawn stuff that Pop has more than earned the right to unleash. But for every glimpse at the punk of old, Pop drops tender moments like ""Gardenia,"" a lush, catchy love song that's also ever-so-slightly eerie. The most sentimental moments, though, come when the band is clearly channeling Pop's high point as a solo artist: his collaborations with David Bowie in Berlin on the classic '70s albums The Idiot and Lust For Life. ""Sunday,"" for instance, unabashedly recalls that era with its skeletal yet punchy drumming, sculpted guitar and avant-garage edge.

In ""German Days,"" the record's most flagrantly nostalgic song, Homme and his team tap into the decadent, wiry menace of the Berlin albums while Pop glances back with rueful irony at Lust For Life: ""When your love of life is an empty beach / When it's painful to express the things you feel."" In lesser hands, that might come off as self-parody, but instead, the singer sounds like he's owning his legacy  and having a good time doing it, introspection notwithstanding. If Post Pop Depression does end up being Pop's last recorded hurrah, it's a worthy one.",[]

The finest country songwriters understand that the best way to a big idea is often through a small detail. Consider the central gesture that dictates the action in Brandy Clark's beautiful song ""I Cried,"" which appears on producer Dave Cobb's graceful compilation album Southern Family. Contemplating a grandfather's death and his wife's ensuing loneliness, Clark builds the song's chorus around the phrase, ""I cried,"" her voice arching up into a tender, transcendent falsetto; in the next line, she takes the mood down again. ""I tried to hold my head high, it ended up in my hands."" That simple image so effectively captures the experience of living with grief: the attempt to show strength for others, for your own sanity, and the gradual, quiet, repetitive sag into vulnerability. Who hasn't experienced this moment at a funeral  or, as Clark describes, while simply talking on the phone with a fellow loved one left behind? There's no need for an angel's trumpets here. ""I Cried"" says more about mortality with a sigh.

Southern Family collects such moments in a bouquet of memories and treasured sentiments, in the process coalescing into one of the subtlest concept albums to ever bear that dangerously pretentious descriptor. Inspired by the 1979 album White Mansions, a song cycle about the Civil War spearheaded by the writer Paul Kennerly and produced by Glyn Johns, Cobb's own effort doesn't adhere to a linear narrative the way its predecessor does. It's more like the way we tell tales now, in dialogue across social media, our individual experiences adding up to a collective portrait of our times.

Mainstream country stars and Americana favorites show why those separate categories are increasingly meaningless  at least in Cobb's world, where a strong composition and an unfussy live arrangement always get to the core of things. Miranda Lambert's hymnlike ""Sweet Bye And Bye"" complements Jason Isbell's righteous ""God Is A Working Man"" (a great campaign song for the right candidate, by the way). ""Mama's Table,"" a perfect ballad Jamey Johnson originally wrote for the Oak Ridge Boys and himself sings here, gets an answer from Zac Brown in ""Grandma's Garden."" John Paul White offers his own funeral confession in the heartrending ""Simple Song 1,"" while Anderson East confronts another life passage  parents' divorce  in ""Learning."" Alongside offerings by Holly Williams, Morgane and Chris Stapleton, Shooter Jennings, the excellent newcomer Brent Cobb (cousin of Dave), and Rich Robinson (who brings gospel into the mix via the Settles Connection chorus in the grand closer ""The Way Home""), these songs ground place and community in the experience of the everyday: a kid's bottle of Cheerwise, a brother's initials carved in Grandma's table, an old song that means something different when you sing it in nursery school and, later, to your own child.

Hotly anticipated as Dave Cobb's grand statement about the generation of mostly Southern artists who, with his help, are shifting the definitions of both country and Americana music, this collection succeeds by being as modest as its helmsman. ""Southern"" and ""family"" are both fraught terms  as are ""country"" and ""Americana""  but instead of trying to clearly define them, Cobb (who plays guitar in nearly every track) encouraged his collaborators to approach them gently. The 12 resulting songs reflect family structures that are in flux but which endure because of love and memory, in a South constructed at backyard parties and in mothers' kitchens more than in any legislature or historical site.

Southern Family also reflects the eclecticism of the music that's long emanated from Nashville and its environs. Clark's track, enhanced by pedal steel and Mellotron, is high countrypolitan class; East's has the Muscle Shoals swagger he's made his trademark. Lambert invokes the Southern gospel her song title recalls. Brent Cobb gets swampy in the comical ""Down Home,"" while White finds the place where folk music meets The Beatles. Bluegrass and blues and righteous Southern rock all find a place here. More than anything else, Southern Family is an argument for tradition as an organic concept, not an imposed one. Family is in the details, and to capture those details we have to listen to each other and accept the joy, the pain and the differences.",[]

Glenn Jones makes real albums. That may seem obvious for someone who has released six full-length solo records. But in the musical form that Jones practices  an instrumental acoustic-guitar tradition known as American Primitive  it's not a given. Because the style requires technical skill, it can be tempting to just rip out a few displays of finger-picked prowess, slap them together and call it all an album.

For Jones, that wouldn't be enough. His records are consistently thematic and thoughtful, exploring ideas that work together rather than merely occupying the same piece of vinyl. Fleeting is his most cohesive album. Each song flows naturally into the next, with motifs repeated in small variations and moods that connect across track breaks. Many of Jones' artistic concerns  places and environments, musical forefathers, the passage of time  arise simultaneously, as if they're branches of a single tree.

The bright lines of ""Flower Turned Inside-Out"" seem mirrored by the slower, more pensive shapes of ""Close To The Ground."" Bittersweet plucks in ""Mother's Day"" evoke holidays spent with loved ones, while similar meditations strike a more forward-looking tone in ""June Too Soon, October All Over."" Two pieces, ""Cleo Awake"" and ""Cleo Asleep,"" are literal counterparts, as Jones plays the same melody on banjo and guitar to mimic the cycle of morning and night. Perhaps that's why he called the album Fleeting  the emotions he explores may recur, but the days they inhabit keep passing by.

On that count, two songs feel especially poignant. The searching banjo piece ""Spokane River Falls"", named after the city in Washington where Jones was born, is like an internal, nostalgic conversation. Short, sweet phrases return like memories that refuse to fade. In ""Portrait Of Basho As A Young Dragon,"" Jones converses with one of his biggest influences, the late guitarist Robbie Basho. With delicate notes and decisive strums, Jones reckons with Basho's legacy and adds to it in the process. In that sense, he's time-traveling, moving backward and forward until the present blurs, turning something fleeting into something beautiful.",[]

When Florida voters go to vote on March 15, the state's voting machines may once again be in the spotlight.

Back in 2000, the nation's most spectacular elections meltdown took place in Florida thanks to the infamous paper butterfly ballots, ancient voting machines and poorly trained poll workers. The ensuing chaos led to a massive recount, a Supreme Court battle and a narrow victory for George W. Bush.

Between the international scrutiny and federal funds, most Florida counties bought new voting machines after that. But almost 16 years later, this generation of machines is nearing the end of its life.

""We don't expect our laptops or our desktops to last a decade, and that's the kind of consumer electronics and technology that these machines are using,"" says Christopher Famaghetti of New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, who worked on a report about the state of voting machines nationwide.

toggle caption Renata Sago/WMFE

In Polk County, Fla., poll workers in training fumble with clunky beige machines, among the oldest in the state. Like teachers grading Scantron tests, they feed paper ballots into the equipment. Some 280,000 voters are expected to head to the polls in this part of central Florida.

Longtime poll worker William Carroway calls optical scan machines ""reliable.""

""People like the idea that they actually put their ballot in,"" he says. ""They want to know their ballot was counted. They don't see that with the touch screen.""

The machines scan ballots with an infrared reader and the results are transmitted to the state capital, old school, through a dial up modem.

It's 1990s technology that the county first used, ironically, during the 2000 election. Unlike other parts of the state, Polk County didn't suffer any of the voting meltdowns other Florida counties did that year.

While state and federal elections experts agree optical scan units are reliable, the issue that arises is age: Problems crop up when they hit the 10 year mark. This year, 43 states will be using machines that are least that old, according to the Brennan Center report.

Optical scan units are prone to especially serious problems, ""things like motherboard failures, papers jams, the rollers that pull paper ballots into the machines can dry up over time,"" said Famaghetti.

One Florida county had to buy parts off eBay because the manufacturer no longer made them. Famaghetti estimates the cost of new voting machines across the country could exceed $1 billion, a tab states and counties would have to pay themselves.

But it's not just about the money, argues Polk County's Supervisor Of Elections Lori Edwards.

""This equipment is accurate. The poll workers enjoy working with it and our voters feel very comfortable with the equipment,"" Edwards says.



The latest model optical scan units take a digital photo of each ballot that can be saved to a flash drive. Edwards questions the utility of this technology update.

Her philosophy on updating the county's equipment? Don't worry.

""If every piece of this equipment died on Election Day, we have every single ballot and we know where it is and we know how to count those,"" Edwards says. ""It may take a while, but we're very comfortable to be able to rely on those easy to read ballots.""

This scenario is unlikely, Famaghetti says. He stresses, ""... nobody we spoke with said that all the machines are going to break down at once.""

But the machines will break down sooner or later, and Famaghetti says state and local governments will eventually need to find the money to replace them.



Meanwhile, Edwards says it will likely be at least two to four years before Polk County voters will slide their ballots through new machines. She is looking ahead to next week's primary.



""If we weren't confident, we wouldn't be doing it this way,"" says Edwards. ""This is much too important. You can't put a price tag on democracy.""",[]

Record numbers of airline passengers will soon be taking off for spring break, expecting to find fun.

But first, they'll have to get through the Transportation Security Administration screening at the airport. Definitely no fun there.

Both the TSA and Airlines For America (A4A), an industry trade group, say travelers should brace for long waits in epic lines. ""It's a very serious concern,"" A4A Senior Vice President Sharon Pinkerton said on a conference call with journalists Wednesday.

Earlier this week, the TSA released a statement saying it ""expects passenger volumes to drastically increase throughout the month of March as spring breakers take to the skies and throughout the summer.""

TSA's top advice: ""Arrive early.""

How early? Experts say passengers should get to the airport two hours before a domestic departure and three hours for international flights to clear the snaking security lines.

Pinkerton says TSA needs more screeners. ""The staffing is not adequate and it needs to be,"" she said. In addition, TSA equipment should be better maintained to avoid breakdowns, she said.

TSA doesn't deny such problems, saying they reflect recent federal budget cuts. Also, officers must take more time this year to examine bags to reduce heightened terrorism risks.

At a Senate hearing last week, TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger said his agency needs more funding to ""right-size and appropriately resource TSA and halt further reductions in officer staffing.""

The Obama administration is asking Congress to support 42,848 officers by boosting TSA's fiscal 2017 budget to $3 billion, which would be $26.9 million more than fiscal 2016. Currently, TSA has roughly 41,000 officers on duty.

The TSA troubles are coming at a time when travel has been surging, especially to sunny vacation destinations. For example, TSA says it expects 13 percent more volume at checkpoints in Orlando, Fla., this March, and 8.5 percent more at Fort Myers, Fla., compared with last year.

A4A chief economist John Heimlich, also on the conference call, said Americans definitely are in the mood to travel. He said he's confident that in 2015, passengers set a record. The Transportation Department is expected to release the final headcount at 11 a.m. ET Thursday.

Heimlich said he expects new records for 2016. He noted that for March and April  the peak time for spring break and Easter vacation travel  U.S. airlines are expecting about 140 million passengers, up from last year's record of 136.2 million. Back in 2007, before Americans hunkered down for the recession, the March and April total was 135.1 million.

Airlines are responding to the new normal. ""To meet the extra demand, airlines are deploying new and larger aircraft on many routes,"" Heimlich said.

The strong demand has been allowing carriers to boost fares on many routes, especially in smaller markets with less competition. But carriers also have been offering discounts on popular flights in competitive markets.

Overall, fares are up about $22 per round trip compared with last year, according to FareCompare.com, which tracks such changes.

Last year, when jet fuel prices were falling, airline operating expenses were dropping as well  down by $14 billion, or 9.5 percent, the A4A said. A portion of those savings were passed along to consumers in the form of a 5.1 percent decline in fares for all of 2015.

Lower fuel prices, combined with the higher demand for tickets, have been boosting airline earnings. The A4A report showed the industry collectively reported pretax earnings of $23.2 billion, resulting in a margin of 14.6 percent  up from 6 percent in 2014.

But the trade group also pointed out how tough the recession was on the boom-and-bust industry. Over the past five years, U.S. carriers made a pre-tax profit of about 5 percent, far lower than the 13.8 percent average of the S&P 500 during the same period.",[]

""I went looking for a new direction / Indecisive, undecided,"" Damien Jurado sings in ""Onalaska,"" one of the eeriest tracks on his new album, Visions Of Us On The Land. He's singing in character; there's nothing remotely indecisive or undecided about Visions. His direction, though, is indeed pretty new. The album is the final installment of a loose trilogy Jurado began with 2012's Maraqopa and continued on 2014's Brothers And Sisters Of The Eternal Son. This time around, he's delivered a sprawling, 17-song story arc that picks up where Brothers left off  that is to say, somewhere near the edge of terra incognita. After a car crash sends the trilogy's unnamed protagonist on some hazy kind of metaphysical odyssey, he's arrived at a state of existential bemusement, searching his psyche for answers. It's a heady concept, for sure, but one that Jurado anchors in gorgeous songwriting and lush, layered indie-folk arrangements.

That said, Visions isn't folky in a heart-on-the-sleeve kind of way. Jurado's no stranger to sad, sparse songs  he built his early career on them  but on Visions' ""Sam And Davy,"" for instance, he forgoes the acoustic confessional in favor of something far grander. Not to mention bleak: With minor chords, booming bass-drum detonations and menacing flourishes of synth, Jurado yanks the wheel and forces a detour into the depths of psychedelic reverie, asking, ""Does your blood run cold / Or your eyes go white / On a borrowed soul / And on borrowed time?"" In ""Prisms,"" Jurado channels one of his longtime heroes, Nick Drake; a more skeletal, guitar-plus-vocal track, it ponders the nature of memory as Jurado sings, ""Do we still go on / Long after rewind?"" His voice is so ghostly and echoing, it answers his own question.

Things don't exactly get upbeat from there  although ""Exit 353,"" the first song he wrote for the album, has more of a left hook to it. A propulsive, chillingly lonely dirge spiked with a distorted, tooth-rattling guitar riff, it contains yet another unsettling question (""Are we all not lost in song?"") whose response is self-evident. And in ""A.M. A.M.,"" Jurado's singsong, reverb-cushioned melody is as plush as it is haunting. Richard Swift, an accomplished singer-songwriter in his own right, once again provides the assist as both producer and guest instrumentalist; his shadowy atmospherics stand out in ""Mellow Blue Polka Dot,"" a cooing, catchy shuffle that recalls Bill Callahan's dark pop explorations.

Jurado has been playing the long game with his trilogy of albums, but the story arc doesn't come to a satisfying conclusion  nor should it. After the fingerpicked, Dylan-esque hush of ""Orphans In The Key Of E,"" Jurado wraps up the album with a glance over the shoulder: ""When I look back upon my time, see the snapshots of my life,"" he sings, ""You will not be surprised to see your name across my smile."" It's a small, welcome moment of sentimental peace, but it's fraught with its own ominous sense of loss as the refrain of ""I will remember you / The way you are right now"" begins to sound more like a fading distress signal than a comfort. As works of mood-altering music go, Jurado has upped the dosage with Visions. It's a harrowing trip, led by a guide who's all too familiar with the territory.",[]

Once upon a time, the Democratic National Committee had a plan for just four debates among the party's candidates for president. The general feeling among activists was that too many debates risked overexposing the candidates, their differences and the divisions within the party.

There had been too many debates, they felt, in 2008. It was just bad politics.

Now, some months later, the DNC has allowed eight debates, the latest in Miami on Wednesday night, sponsored by Univision and The Washington Post and broadcast on CNN. The first few debates were tucked into difficult time slots involving holidays or major sports events, but the latest have been relatively easy for the country as a whole to see.

The cast of contenders, originally five, has for more than a month now been down to two, one of whom will almost surely be the nominee. And judging by this latest clash, and the previous edition last Sunday night, it is easy to see why the DNC originally wanted the series to be shorter.

Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had at each other for two hours in each of these events, trading accusations and answering journalists' questions laden with accusations. Their various vulnerabilities and shortcomings have been clearly on display.

And while these last two debates were not nearly as raw and rivalrous as the most recent Republican debates, neither were they as collegial as the first two Democratic debates last fall.

Sanders ripped into Clinton for taking money from Wall Street in contributions and speaking fees. Clinton pounded Sanders for his vote against the 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill negotiated by the late Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy.

Again on Wednesday night, both candidates had plenty of partisans in the audience to provide cheers and applause, as well as occasional hoots and other expressions of disapproval for the media moderators.

Both candidates also had plenty of prepared material, much of which was already familiar. Sanders talked about the ""rigged economy"" and the ""corrupt campaign finance system,"" the inequality of income (most of the income growth since the 2009 recession going to the top 1 percent) and the failure of capitalism to care about its workers.

Clinton talked about the need to extend President Obama's policies in virtually every area of governance, from the Affordable Care Act to the Dodd-Frank regulation of the financial sector. She defended her many contributions from the Wall Street world of finance in part by saying President Obama had taken Wall Street money, too.

But Clinton, like Sanders, did not defend the current administration's policies on deportation of recent immigrants without legal status. Both said they would end the deportation of children and the breaking up of families. It was a major area of agreement during the evening.

Asked for a specific commitment regarding the deportation of children, Clinton said: ""I will not deport children, I will not deport children."" She then proceeded to detail her priorities for other categories of people that might be subject to deportation, including violent criminals and those who plot terrorist attacks.

Sanders also disavowed child deportation, as well as the Obama administration's deportation policies, which have repatriated many thousands. He decried the very idea of mass deportations of the 11 million undocumented people now estimated to be in the U.S. While not contemplated by most of the policy community, just such a deportation is a cornerstone of the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

Clinton called Trump's ""very tall"" wall on the Mexican border ""a fantasy.""

Given the setting, the sponsors and the audience, questions about immigration were a natural centerpiece for the debate. But the questioners also touched on the vacancy on the Supreme Court, the minimum wage and a separate set of vulnerabilities unique to each.

Sanders was asked about a 1985 video in which he criticized the U.S. for its interventionist policies in Latin America, particularly regarding Cuba. He had some praise, in the video, for the Castro regime on that island.

Sanders did not repudiate the views in the video and said the U.S. had overstepped the enforcement of the Monroe Doctrine regarding its security in the hemisphere.

Clinton was challenged regarding her handling of her private email server and also her allegedly misleading remarks to the families of U.S. personnel after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. Both issues are fraught with political peril as both have been focal points for Republicans.

At one point, moderator Jorge Ramos of Univision asked her point-blank if she would withdraw from the race if indicted for the email arrangement.

""Oh for goodness ... "" Clinton began. ""That's not going to happen. I'm not even going to answer that question.""

Clinton was also put on the spot to explain her loss this week in the Michigan primary, which polls had predicted she would win easily. She smiled and said she had still received more votes and more delegates than Sanders that day because Michigan was such a close vote and her victory in Mississippi had been overwhelming.

Next week, the two candidates again face off in voting in varied parts of the country: Florida, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina and Missouri. While not as numerous as the states on ""Super Tuesday,"" these five are among the most populous states in the country and therefore supply a comparable payoff in terms of delegates. Their cumulative impact could be even greater.

Clinton has already passed the halfway point in pursuit of the 2,383 delegates needed to be nominated in Philadelphia in July. But Sanders' narrow win in Michigan changed the narrative again and raised questions about the reliability of polls in other states where Clinton has had a lead.

The failure of the pollsters and media to foresee Sanders' win in Michigan, where he had been behind by as much as 20 points and more, has cast doubt on all the tools used by observers to foresee results in any election.

That has been good news for Sanders' enthusiasts, who had a field day mocking their antagonists.",[]

i toggle caption AP AP

The Cleveland Clinic says it has removed a transplanted uterus  the first-ever in the U.S.  after the patient suffered from a ""sudden complication.""

The clinic conducted the landmark operation in late February. As we reported, the procedure is intended to ""open up another possible path to parenthood besides surrogacy or adoption for U.S. women who do not have a uterus, or who have a uterus that does not function.""

The transplant was part of a study that the clinic says is meant to include 10 women with uterine factor infertility, meaning ""they were born without a uterus, have lost their uterus, or have a uterus that no longer functions."" The clinic says in a statement that the study will continue despite this setback.

It has provided no details about the reason for the transplant's failure. ""At this time, the circumstance of the complication is under review and more information will be shared as it becomes available,"" the statement reads. The patient, identified only by her first name Lindsey, is ""doing well and recovering.""

Before the complication, the 26-year-old transplant recipient gave a statement at a press conference, carried by Fox 8 Cleveland. She said she was told she could not have children when she was 16. ""And from that moment on, I have prayed that God would allow me the opportunity to experience pregnancy. And here we are today at the beginning of that journey.""

Lindsey thanked her doctors after the procedure failed, saying in the statement: ""I just wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude towards all of my doctors. They acted very quickly to ensure my health and safety.""

For Muslim-Americans, there was a world before Sept. 11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and one after. Now, their community faces the dual threats of extremism and growing atheism.

Young Muslim-Americans are angry and frustrated, but not necessarily for the reasons you might think. While bound by their religion and their community, they have opinions as diverse as their backgrounds.

NPR's Tom Gjelten met a group of young American Muslims to discuss the challenges they see ahead for their community. Below, meet the participants; be sure to click the audio link above to hear their spirited conversation.

On how ISIS challenges American Muslims to think more critically

ISIS preys on our inability to walk and chew gum at the same time. It's making us think more critically. It's making us look critically at the way our media tells stories about how this happens. It's making us think and look critically at American foreign policy. It's making us think and look critically at the way we construct Islam in America.

On how ISIS thrives on ignorance and lack of critical thinking

ISIS is not doing these things just nilly-willy. They're very methodic. So as a Muslim if you go and you try to refute them, you're likely going to fail, because they'll be quoting scripture, sayings of the Prophet, historical events from early Islam. And most Muslims don't have that. They're not equipped with the proper knowledge, and so ISIS thrives on our own ignorance and our lack of critical thinking.

On the growth in both extremism and atheism

On one extreme, you have the yahoos, right? And they're going to go and be attracted by that rhetoric.

i toggle caption Michael W. Bunch/Courtesy of the artist Michael W. Bunch/Courtesy of the artist

The finest country songwriters understand that the best way to a big idea is often through a small detail. Consider the central gesture that dictates the action in Brandy Clark's beautiful song ""I Cried,"" which appears on producer Dave Cobb's graceful compilation album Southern Family. Contemplating a grandfather's death and his wife's ensuing loneliness, Clark builds the song's chorus around the phrase, ""I cried,"" her voice arching up into a tender, transcendent falsetto; in the next line, she takes the mood down again. ""I tried to hold my head high, it ended up in my hands."" That simple image so effectively captures the experience of living with grief: the attempt to show strength for others, for your own sanity, and the gradual, quiet, repetitive sag into vulnerability. Who hasn't experienced this moment at a funeral  or, as Clark describes, while simply talking on the phone with a fellow loved one left behind? There's no need for an angel's trumpets here. ""I Cried"" says more about mortality with a sigh.

Southern Family collects such moments in a bouquet of memories and treasured sentiments, in the process coalescing into one of the subtlest concept albums to ever bear that dangerously pretentious descriptor. Inspired by the 1979 album White Mansions, a song cycle about the Civil War spearheaded by the writer Paul Kennerly and produced by Glyn Johns, Cobb's own effort doesn't adhere to a linear narrative the way its predecessor does. It's more like the way we tell tales now, in dialogue across social media, our individual experiences adding up to a collective portrait of our times.

Mainstream country stars and Americana favorites show why those separate categories are increasingly meaningless  at least in Cobb's world, where a strong composition and an unfussy live arrangement always get to the core of things. Miranda Lambert's hymnlike ""Sweet Bye And Bye"" complements Jason Isbell's righteous ""God Is A Working Man"" (a great campaign song for the right candidate, by the way). ""Mama's Table,"" a perfect ballad Jamey Johnson originally wrote for the Oak Ridge Boys and himself sings here, gets an answer from Zac Brown in ""Grandma's Garden."" John Paul White offers his own funeral confession in the heartrending ""Simple Song 1,"" while Anderson East confronts another life passage  parents' divorce  in ""Learning."" Alongside offerings by Holly Williams, Morgane and Chris Stapleton, Shooter Jennings, the excellent newcomer Brent Cobb (cousin of Dave), and Rich Robinson (who brings gospel into the mix via the Settles Connection chorus in the grand closer ""The Way Home""), these songs ground place and community in the experience of the everyday: a kid's bottle of Cheerwise, a brother's initials carved in Grandma's table, an old song that means something different when you sing it in nursery school and, later, to your own child.

Hotly anticipated as Dave Cobb's grand statement about the generation of mostly Southern artists who, with his help, are shifting the definitions of both country and Americana music, this collection succeeds by being as modest as its helmsman. ""Southern"" and ""family"" are both fraught terms  as are ""country"" and ""Americana""  but instead of trying to clearly define them, Cobb (who plays guitar in nearly every track) encouraged his collaborators to approach them gently. The 12 resulting songs reflect family structures that are in flux but which endure because of love and memory, in a South constructed at backyard parties and in mothers' kitchens more than in any legislature or historical site.

Southern Family also reflects the eclecticism of the music that's long emanated from Nashville and its environs. Clark's track, enhanced by pedal steel and Mellotron, is high countrypolitan class; East's has the Muscle Shoals swagger he's made his trademark. Lambert invokes the Southern gospel her song title recalls. Brent Cobb gets swampy in the comical ""Down Home,"" while White finds the place where folk music meets The Beatles. Bluegrass and blues and righteous Southern rock all find a place here. More than anything else, Southern Family is an argument for tradition as an organic concept, not an imposed one. Family is in the details, and to capture those details we have to listen to each other and accept the joy, the pain and the differences.",[]

Once upon a time, the Democratic National Committee had a plan for just four debates among the party's candidates for president. The general feeling among activists was that too many debates risked overexposing the candidates, their differences and the divisions within the party.

There had been too many debates, they felt, in 2008. It was just bad politics.

Now, some months later, the DNC has allowed eight debates, the latest in Miami on Wednesday night, sponsored by Univision and The Washington Post and broadcast on CNN. The first few debates were tucked into difficult time slots involving holidays or major sports events, but the latest have been relatively easy for the country as a whole to see.

The cast of contenders, originally five, has for more than a month now been down to two, one of whom will almost surely be the nominee. And judging by this latest clash, and the previous edition last Sunday night, it is easy to see why the DNC originally wanted the series to be shorter.

Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had at each other for two hours in each of these events, trading accusations and answering journalists' questions laden with accusations. Their various vulnerabilities and shortcomings have been clearly on display.

And while these last two debates were not nearly as raw and rivalrous as the most recent Republican debates, neither were they as collegial as the first two Democratic debates last fall.

Sanders ripped into Clinton for taking money from Wall Street in contributions and speaking fees. Clinton pounded Sanders for his vote against the 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill negotiated by the late Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy.

Again on Wednesday night, both candidates had plenty of partisans in the audience to provide cheers and applause, as well as occasional hoots and other expressions of disapproval for the media moderators.

Both candidates also had plenty of prepared material, much of which was already familiar. Sanders talked about the ""rigged economy"" and the ""corrupt campaign finance system,"" the inequality of income (most of the income growth since the 2009 recession going to the top 1 percent) and the failure of capitalism to care about its workers.

Clinton talked about the need to extend President Obama's policies in virtually every area of governance, from the Affordable Care Act to the Dodd-Frank regulation of the financial sector. She defended her many contributions from the Wall Street world of finance in part by saying President Obama had taken Wall Street money, too.

But Clinton, like Sanders, did not defend the current administration's policies on deportation of recent immigrants without legal status. Both said they would end the deportation of children and the breaking up of families. It was a major area of agreement during the evening.

Asked for a specific commitment regarding the deportation of children, Clinton said: ""I will not deport children, I will not deport children."" She then proceeded to detail her priorities for other categories of people that might be subject to deportation, including violent criminals and those who plot terrorist attacks.

Sanders also disavowed child deportation, as well as the Obama administration's deportation policies, which have repatriated many thousands. He decried the very idea of mass deportations of the 11 million undocumented people now estimated to be in the U.S. While not contemplated by most of the policy community, just such a deportation is a cornerstone of the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

Clinton called Trump's ""very tall"" wall on the Mexican border ""a fantasy.""

Given the setting, the sponsors and the audience, questions about immigration were a natural centerpiece for the debate. But the questioners also touched on the vacancy on the Supreme Court, the minimum wage and a separate set of vulnerabilities unique to each.

Sanders was asked about a 1985 video in which he criticized the U.S. for its interventionist policies in Latin America, particularly regarding Cuba. He had some praise, in the video, for the Castro regime on that island.

Sanders did not repudiate the views in the video and said the U.S. had overstepped the enforcement of the Monroe Doctrine regarding its security in the hemisphere.

Clinton was challenged regarding her handling of her private email server and also her allegedly misleading remarks to the families of U.S. personnel after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. Both issues are fraught with political peril as both have been focal points for Republicans.

At one point, moderator Jorge Ramos of Univision asked her point-blank if she would withdraw from the race if indicted for the email arrangement.

""Oh for goodness ... "" Clinton began. ""That's not going to happen. I'm not even going to answer that question.""

Clinton was also put on the spot to explain her loss this week in the Michigan primary, which polls had predicted she would win easily. She smiled and said she had still received more votes and more delegates than Sanders that day because Michigan was such a close vote and her victory in Mississippi had been overwhelming.

Next week, the two candidates again face off in voting in varied parts of the country: Florida, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina and Missouri. While not as numerous as the states on ""Super Tuesday,"" these five are among the most populous states in the country and therefore supply a comparable payoff in terms of delegates. Their cumulative impact could be even greater.

Clinton has already passed the halfway point in pursuit of the 2,383 delegates needed to be nominated in Philadelphia in July. But Sanders' narrow win in Michigan changed the narrative again and raised questions about the reliability of polls in other states where Clinton has had a lead.

The failure of the pollsters and media to foresee Sanders' win in Michigan, where he had been behind by as much as 20 points and more, has cast doubt on all the tools used by observers to foresee results in any election.

That has been good news for Sanders' enthusiasts, who had a field day mocking their antagonists.",[]

You might call it old wine in new bottles, but what sweet, masterfully crafted wine it is. Upheld by Stillness, the debut album by the young and vibrant British a cappella choir ORA, presents a contemporary twist on a 16th-century classic.

The group, founded in 2014 by Artistic Director Suzi Digby, asked a handful of today's choral composers to create a musical response to William Byrd's Mass for Five Voices, an intricate, richly scored polyphonic work popular with choirs around the world. Each composer took inspiration from one of the five movements of the Mass, while Byrd's original (written around 1595) forms the centerpiece of the album.

Roxanna Panufnik (daughter of the late Polish composer Andrzej Panufnik) chose Byrd's Kyrie, the traditional mass opener which pleads for God's mercy (""Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison"").

Beginning and ending in hushed reverence, Panufnik's version slowly blooms in contemporary harmonies. Voices interweave in dusky colors, pierced by strands of white light from the upper ranges of ORA's beautifully blended sopranos. Two minutes in, the piece pauses on a lovely drone from the basses, before the vocal engine chugs back up to speed  ominous and inevitable.

Hot blue lightning seems to crackle, Star-Wars-Emperor-style, across the surface of The Complete Wimmen's Comix. Its title is a cheeky riff on the renaming passion that consumed feminism in the early '70s, and its two volumes come in a (actually rather ugly) salmon-colored box decorated with examples of the series' highly inconsistent artwork. The whole bulky thing feels like a suitcase bomb packed with jagged hunks of social revolution. And that energy keeps sparking throughout the 704 pages of this frenetic, anarchic, occasionally kamikaze production.

It's hard to think of an aspect of women's lives, real or fantastical, that Wimmen's Comix doesn't touch on. In 1971's ""Breaking Out,"" a cabal of female comics characters  including Little Lulu, Betty and Veronica, and Petunia Pig  rise up against sexist double standards. (Betty and Veronica picket outside the high school, demanding classes in karate and women's history.) In Joyce Farmer's 1975 ""Equal Rites,"" a dozen naked witches hold a birthing ritual to summon their forbears' spirits from outer space. Cecelia Capuana's ""Modemorphose,"" from 1985, shows women's bodies changing to reflect the strangeness of female fashion: The figures grow huge bottoms, uni-bosoms or multiple legs that stick out in all directions.

Many of the artists fantasize about crime. In 1976's ""Petite Morte,"" Joey Epstein envisions an all-woman street gang called the Tenderettes that rolls men for drug money  until one gang member develops a strange and lethal passion for their marks. In Melinda Gebbie's 1976 ""The Confectionary,"" a sex-starved woman holds up a couple, kills the woman and rapes the man. Sharon Rudahl tells of a woman helping her son escape from a Mexican jail in ""Jailbreak at Hermosillo.""

Some artists simply turn a wry eye on the mundanities of life. In 1988, Mary Fleener recalls her friendship with a self-dramatizing ""Trauma Mama."" In Teresa Richards' 1976 ""Chapstick,"" a woman fantasizes a steamy, explicit tryst on an elevator, then settles down to watch ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.""

It's genuinely painful to imagine the radical, clashing perspectives that might have been found in these pages if the collective had only reached out to more women of color.

It may be hard to see how ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"" and female-on-male rape can find homes in the same publication. But there's a strong, common current of energy unifying Wimmen's Comix. That's partly because some feminist issues, like abortion, are as fraught today as they were back in 1971. It's also because the collective seems to have remained mostly white, as far as can be judged from the photos in the introduction and the skin tone that predominates in the comics. It's genuinely painful to imagine the radical, clashing perspectives that might have been found in these pages if the collective had only reached out to more women of color.

They did reach out to a huge number of contributors  apparently regardless of artistic talent. The artwork is a total grab bag, ranging from the polished creations of Rudahl, Trina Robbins, Phoebe Gloeckner and Dot Bucher to painfully amateurish doodles by creators better left unnamed. Mixed in is subversive work in which wild, even ugly scrawls evoke an unnerving sense of chaos (Dori Seda, Diane Noomin and the perennially obstreperous Aline Kominsky-Crumb). There's even the occasional contribution from a soon-to-be-notable name (Lynda Barry, Alison Bechdel, Julie Doucet).

There's one more reason for the unity of spirit in Wimmen's Comix: These these artists, all clearly in agreement that ""the personal is political,"" are much more comfortable with the first half of that pairing. They do tackle equal pay for equal work in the publication's early years and AIDS in later ones, with a dizzying assortment of topics in between. Rape, prostitution, sexual harassment, vegetarian cooking, science fiction, gothic romances, socks, bondage, nuns, farting, motorcycles and magic all feature in these pages. There are feminist fairy tales, stories of Harriet Tubman and Julia Pastrana, the Ugliest Woman in the World, a board game, and a pointillist study of a cervix. There's even a 3-D issue (glasses included).

Still, though, these comics largely stick to the personal, to relationships and fantasies and the absurdities of everyday life. Whether it's 1971 or 1989, the contributors' favorite topics are self-definition and men, men, men. (Not to mention sex, sex, sex. Everyone is doing it in these pages, including cats and bugs.)

This says something about the nature of women and the nature of comics. It may be that, however revolutionary women's goals are, our first impulse is always to change ourselves before we take on the world at large. And it seems that no matter how talented the artist, it's just really hard to be funny about equal pay for equal work.

Record numbers of airline passengers will soon be taking off for spring break, expecting to find fun.

But first, they'll have to get through the Transportation Security Administration screening at the airport. Definitely no fun there.

Both the TSA and Airlines For America (A4A), an industry trade group, say travelers should brace for long waits in epic lines. ""It's a very serious concern,"" A4A Senior Vice President Sharon Pinkerton said on a conference call with journalists Wednesday.

Earlier this week, the TSA released a statement saying it ""expects passenger volumes to drastically increase throughout the month of March as spring breakers take to the skies and throughout the summer.""

TSA's top advice: ""Arrive early.""

How early? Experts say passengers should get to the airport two hours before a domestic departure and three hours for international flights to clear the snaking security lines.

Pinkerton says TSA needs more screeners. ""The staffing is not adequate and it needs to be,"" she said. In addition, TSA equipment should be better maintained to avoid breakdowns, she said.

TSA doesn't deny such problems, saying they reflect recent federal budget cuts. Also, officers must take more time this year to examine bags to reduce heightened terrorism risks.

At a Senate hearing last week, TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger said his agency needs more funding to ""right-size and appropriately resource TSA and halt further reductions in officer staffing.""

The Obama administration is asking Congress to support 42,848 officers by boosting TSA's fiscal 2017 budget to $3 billion, which would be $26.9 million more than fiscal 2016. Currently, TSA has roughly 41,000 officers on duty.

The TSA troubles are coming at a time when travel has been surging, especially to sunny vacation destinations. For example, TSA says it expects 13 percent more volume at checkpoints in Orlando, Fla., this March, and 8.5 percent more at Fort Myers, Fla., compared with last year.

A4A chief economist John Heimlich, also on the conference call, said Americans definitely are in the mood to travel. He said he's confident that in 2015, passengers set a record. The Transportation Department is expected to release the final headcount at 11 a.m. ET Thursday.

Heimlich said he expects new records for 2016. He noted that for March and April  the peak time for spring break and Easter vacation travel  U.S. airlines are expecting about 140 million passengers, up from last year's record of 136.2 million. Back in 2007, before Americans hunkered down for the recession, the March and April total was 135.1 million.

Airlines are responding to the new normal. ""To meet the extra demand, airlines are deploying new and larger aircraft on many routes,"" Heimlich said.

The strong demand has been allowing carriers to boost fares on many routes, especially in smaller markets with less competition. But carriers also have been offering discounts on popular flights in competitive markets.

Overall, fares are up about $22 per round trip compared with last year, according to FareCompare.com, which tracks such changes.

Last year, when jet fuel prices were falling, airline operating expenses were dropping as well  down by $14 billion, or 9.5 percent, the A4A said. A portion of those savings were passed along to consumers in the form of a 5.1 percent decline in fares for all of 2015.

Glenn Jones makes real albums. That may seem obvious for someone who has released six full-length solo records. But in the musical form that Jones practices  an instrumental acoustic-guitar tradition known as American Primitive  it's not a given. Because the style requires technical skill, it can be tempting to just rip out a few displays of finger-picked prowess, slap them together and call it all an album.

For Jones, that wouldn't be enough. His records are consistently thematic and thoughtful, exploring ideas that work together rather than merely occupying the same piece of vinyl. Fleeting is his most cohesive album. Each song flows naturally into the next, with motifs repeated in small variations and moods that connect across track breaks. Many of Jones' artistic concerns  places and environments, musical forefathers, the passage of time  arise simultaneously, as if they're branches of a single tree.

The bright lines of ""Flower Turned Inside-Out"" seem mirrored by the slower, more pensive shapes of ""Close To The Ground."" Bittersweet plucks in ""Mother's Day"" evoke holidays spent with loved ones, while similar meditations strike a more forward-looking tone in ""June Too Soon, October All Over."" Two pieces, ""Cleo Awake"" and ""Cleo Asleep,"" are literal counterparts, as Jones plays the same melody on banjo and guitar to mimic the cycle of morning and night. Perhaps that's why he called the album Fleeting  the emotions he explores may recur, but the days they inhabit keep passing by.

On that count, two songs feel especially poignant. The searching banjo piece ""Spokane River Falls"", named after the city in Washington where Jones was born, is like an internal, nostalgic conversation. Short, sweet phrases return like memories that refuse to fade. In ""Portrait Of Basho As A Young Dragon,"" Jones converses with one of his biggest influences, the late guitarist Robbie Basho. With delicate notes and decisive strums, Jones reckons with Basho's legacy and adds to it in the process. In that sense, he's time-traveling, moving backward and forward until the present blurs, turning something fleeting into something beautiful.",[]

In 1962, George Martin signed an unknown band: The Beatles. Steve Inskeep talks to Ray Connolly, who made a documentary series with Martin called The Rhythm of Life, about Martin's death at age 90.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

We are remembering Sir George Martin, who died yesterday at the age of 90. In 1962, while working for a British record label, he signed an unknown band called The Beatles. We're going to talk now with author and filmmaker Ray Connolly, who interviewed The Beatles many times and also made a documentary series with George Martin about music called ""The Rhythm Of Life."" Welcome to the program, sir.

RAY CONNOLLY: Good morning.

INSKEEP: Producer can be so many things for a musical group. What was Martin's job, really, with The Beatles?

CONNOLLY: He was the arranger. When they'd bring a song in, he's listen to it and say, well, you know, this is - this is OK. But have you thought about doing it in four-four time or maybe doing three-four time? That sort of thing - and then he would add all these instruments. He would sort of say, well, you know, that's great. But what else can you do? And then The Beatles would sort of throw out ideas themselves. So they would work in very, very close collaboration. The great thing about it was that George Martin knew everything there was to know about classical music. The Beatles knew whatever there was to know about rock n roll but nothing about classical music. So you put the two together - fantastic symbiosis. And so George took The Beatles from just rock n roll to ""Penny Lane,"" ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" ""Sgt. Pepper.""

INSKEEP: And added sophistication to the music, I would imagine.

CONNOLLY: Absolutely.

INSKEEP: What you're describing is the role of an editor, really, which can be psychologically challenging for the artist because Martin is the guy telling you your song is not right or your song is not complete. They must have really trusted him.

CONNOLLY: Well, yeah, at first, you know, they would do whatever he said because, you know, he was the boss. He was like a schoolteacher. And that's the way he came across all the time. He was like a schoolteacher. And he helped them. And then later on, of course, they wanted to have more say. In the end, when they finished - when they finished recording together, John Lennon - and actually John was being a bit mean about this. He kind of said, well, you know, we want to do it ourselves now. They weren't as good without George Martin.

INSKEEP: Did they resent it a little bit when there were stories suggesting that Martin was the guy who was...

CONNOLLY: Yeah, I think they did. I think John did. But then later on, he and George got together. And I remember George telling me how he'd been talking to John. And John had said, I wish I could record the songs again. George said, well, which songs, John? He said, all of them. But with George Martin doing it, you know.

INSKEEP: Oh, my goodness.

CONNOLLY: He was that important, you know.

INSKEEP: And when you listen to Beatles music, is there something - or anybody's music, really - is there something that causes you to say, that's George Martin? That's George Martin in there.

CONNOLLY: I can certainly do it on Beatle records because I know exactly what he did. On ""Penny Lane,"" played piano - he introduced the piccolo and the trumpet (ph), things like that. You know, if The Beatles hadn't met George Martin, they'd have been a fantastic rock 'n' roll band. Because they met George Martin, who would take them, you know, in other directions, they were much more interesting.

INSKEEP: Can I just mention there's something about Beatles music that feels timeless? There's so much music from the '60s that might be great music. But it's music from the '60s. The Beatles' music feels a little different to me. Was that George Martin's influence, particularly that classical music influence you mentioned?

CONNOLLY: I think it was partly that. I think, you know, rock 'n' roll is - it's American music. The Beatles took it further. And they made it English music - very, very English music. So you know, I mean, songs like ""Penny Lane,"" they are very English. And that's partly George too. I mean, when Paul sang ""When I'm 64,"" that was like an old-time English musical song. Well, George know how to do it, you know? Paul would say, well, what about this? And George would say, well, hang on. I've got an idea. At Abbey Road where they recorded, there was this sort of band room and these old instruments there. And the boys would bring things out and say, what does this sound like? And George would say, well, you can do this and do that with it, you know? Add a harpsichord here. Add this. Add that - you know? - fantastic.

INSKEEP: You said another interesting thing I hadn't thought about. We think of this British group that grabbed an American music style and even played, you know, old American tunes on some of their early records.

CONNOLLY: Yeah.

INSKEEP: But you're saying that Martin was the one who made them what they really were.

CONNOLLY: I think he was. I think he was. And I mean, The Beatles may say, no, we could do it without him. But I doubt it. I think George brought a hell of a lot to them.

INSKEEP: Author and filmmaker Ray Connolly, who knew George Martin for many years. Thanks very much.

CONNOLLY: You're welcome.

Despite controlling Myanmar's newly sworn-in parliament, the party led by Aung San Suu Kyi can't name her as a presidential candidate because she's ineligible under constitutional rules. Conceding that point Thursday, Suu Kyi wrote an apology to her supporters.

The Nobel Peace laureate released a letter Thursday explaining the situation and apologizing for ""not fully fulfilling the people's desire"" by becoming their president, according to Voice of America. Suu Kyi also pledged to keep pursuing the post through peaceful means, even as her party, the National League for Democracy, put forth candidates to act as her proxy.

From Beijing, NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports:

""Suu Kyi met with military leaders several times to try to persuade them to change the country's military-drafted constitution. It bars her from becoming president because her children are foreign citizens. But the generals wouldn't budge. ""Instead, Suu Kyi's party has nominated 70-year-old Htin Kyaw as the front-runner to stand in for her. He's a close ally of hers, an Oxford graduate, and former political prisoner. ""Suu Kyi's party holds a majority in parliament, so when it votes on candidates later this month, Htin Kyaw should be a shoo-in.""

In Myanmar's political system, the president is selected by parliament from three candidates who are first nominated to be vice president. (The two losers retain those posts.) An election could come by the end of next week, with the new president assuming office on April 1.

When her party trounced the competition in elections last fall, Suu Kyi said she would be ""above the president."" She added, ""I'll run the government and we'll have a president who will work in accordance with the policies of the NLD.""",[]

When Florida voters go to vote on March 15, the state's voting machines may once again be in the spotlight.

Back in 2000, the nation's most spectacular elections meltdown took place in Florida thanks to the infamous paper butterfly ballots, ancient voting machines and poorly trained poll workers. The ensuing chaos led to a massive recount, a Supreme Court battle and a narrow victory for George W. Bush.

Between the international scrutiny and federal funds, most Florida counties bought new voting machines after that. But almost 16 years later, this generation of machines is nearing the end of its life.

""We don't expect our laptops or our desktops to last a decade, and that's the kind of consumer electronics and technology that these machines are using,"" says Christopher Famaghetti of New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, who worked on a report about the state of voting machines nationwide.

toggle caption Renata Sago/WMFE

In Polk County, Fla., poll workers in training fumble with clunky beige machines, among the oldest in the state. Like teachers grading Scantron tests, they feed paper ballots into the equipment. Some 280,000 voters are expected to head to the polls in this part of central Florida.

Longtime poll worker William Carroway calls optical scan machines ""reliable.""

""People like the idea that they actually put their ballot in,"" he says. ""They want to know their ballot was counted. They don't see that with the touch screen.""

The machines scan ballots with an infrared reader and the results are transmitted to the state capital, old school, through a dial up modem.

It's 1990s technology that the county first used, ironically, during the 2000 election. Unlike other parts of the state, Polk County didn't suffer any of the voting meltdowns other Florida counties did that year.

While state and federal elections experts agree optical scan units are reliable, the issue that arises is age: Problems crop up when they hit the 10 year mark. This year, 43 states will be using machines that are least that old, according to the Brennan Center report.

Optical scan units are prone to especially serious problems, ""things like motherboard failures, papers jams, the rollers that pull paper ballots into the machines can dry up over time,"" said Famaghetti.

One Florida county had to buy parts off eBay because the manufacturer no longer made them. Famaghetti estimates the cost of new voting machines across the country could exceed $1 billion, a tab states and counties would have to pay themselves.

But it's not just about the money, argues Polk County's Supervisor Of Elections Lori Edwards.

""This equipment is accurate. The poll workers enjoy working with it and our voters feel very comfortable with the equipment,"" Edwards says.



The latest model optical scan units take a digital photo of each ballot that can be saved to a flash drive. Edwards questions the utility of this technology update.

Her philosophy on updating the county's equipment? Don't worry.

""If every piece of this equipment died on Election Day, we have every single ballot and we know where it is and we know how to count those,"" Edwards says. ""It may take a while, but we're very comfortable to be able to rely on those easy to read ballots.""

This scenario is unlikely, Famaghetti says. He stresses, ""... nobody we spoke with said that all the machines are going to break down at once.""

But the machines will break down sooner or later, and Famaghetti says state and local governments will eventually need to find the money to replace them.



Meanwhile, Edwards says it will likely be at least two to four years before Polk County voters will slide their ballots through new machines. She is looking ahead to next week's primary.



""If we weren't confident, we wouldn't be doing it this way,"" says Edwards. ""This is much too important. You can't put a price tag on democracy.""",[]

American intelligence officers are trained to tackle tough targets.

But there are tough targets, and then there's Russian President Vladimir Putin, who plays his cards so closely that it's hard for his own advisers to divine what he's thinking, says Gregory Treverton, chairman of the National Intelligence Council.

""Putin is so isolated that the chances that he might miscalculate and do something rash are top of my list for things I worry about,"" says Treverton. ""I am fond of distinguishing between puzzles  those things that have an answer, though we may not know it  and mysteries, those things that are iffy and contingent. And so how Putin is going to behave is presumably a mystery, and probably even a mystery to Putin.""

Treverton is not alone in this view.

Retired Adm. James Stavridis, commander of NATO forces from 2009 to 2013, says Putin is exceptional in how little he telegraphs.

""He certainly has a cabinet of close advisers,"" Stavridis says.""But at the end of the day, the strategic terrain is not on a map somewhere  it's in between Vladimir Putin's ears.""

That makes it hard for the CIA and other spy agencies charged with tracking Russian military and economic assets  and with anticipating what Moscow might do next on the conflict in Syria, tensions in Crimea and a wide range of other matters.

Stavridis, now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, points to a couple of factors that make Putin such a difficult target.

One is the degree of control he has amassed in his 17 years as either prime minister or president of Russia. You have to look to North Korea, Stavridis says, or to Fidel Castro's long reign in Cuba to find another ruler who wields such absolute power.

The tools of espionage  phone intercepts, satellite imagery and more  can sometimes overcome such disadvantages, but may be of limited use against Putin: He's a trained spy himself.

Vladimir Putin joined the KGB in 1975, and was sent to Dresden in East Germany in order to spy on the West during the Cold War. There he learned both near-flawless German and near-flawless spycraft.

""Russia has always had a very strong counterintelligence capability, and Putin would be well-schooled in this,"" says John McLaughlin, who served as acting director of the CIA in 2004, during Putin's first stint as president. McLaughlin says the aides in whom Putin might confide are mostly ex-KGB, too. ""The inner circle there would be very conscious of how they communicate, conscious of who meets whom. So it's a tough environment for intelligence.""

But McLauglin adds that if you can't peer into Putin's mind, you still can analyze the realities he's grappling with, which may inform his actions.

""In the case of Russia, you would look at the effect of sanctions, which have been very heavy on them,"" McLaughlin says. ""The fact that the ruble is now at kind of an all-time low, the fact that they have a serious capital-flight problem.""

There's also the fact that Putin has spoken openly about his overarching goal of re-establishing Russia as a major world power. It's up to the CIA and other spy agencies to figure out how he plans next to go about it.",[]

Police in Allegheny County, Pa., say five people are dead after unidentified shooters attacked what appeared to be a backyard party in the borough of Wilkinsburg late Wednesday night.

Four people  three women and a man  died at the scene. A female victim died at the hospital. Two men are in critical condition and a woman is in stable condition.

Lt. Andrew Schurman of the county's homicide unit said in a statement, ""It would appear from early examination of the scene that a backyard party/cookout was being held at the rear of the home.

Schurman said shots were fired from an alley to the rear of the property, and that ""partygoers appeared to try to run into the residence at which point a person on the side or backyard adjacent to the residence fired at the back porch.""

""All four of the individuals who died at the scene died on that back porch,"" Schurman added.

Authorities believe at least two suspects fled on foot.

Names, addresses and phone numbers of some 22,000 ISIS recruits  and information about the network that recruited them  are reportedly part of a trove of data that Sky News says it received from a former member of the extremist group.

The identities of people from more than 50 countries, including Britain, European nations, the U.S. and Canada, are in the data, which Sky says it has shared with government authorities.

""Some of the telephone numbers on the list are still active,"" Sky reports, ""and it is believed that although many will be family members, a significant number are used by the jihadis themselves.""

It's not yet clear how many of the thousands of people named in the documents might have traveled to join ISIS, and how many may still be in their home countries.

Among the most intriguing elements of the data trove: 23-line recruitment forms that were filled out by sponsors that begin with recruits' ""name"" and ""fighter name"" and then include their mother's maiden name and their blood type. Education and job experience are also covered; so are combat experience and ""date and place of death""  implying that the paperwork was meant to follow the recruit once they've joined ISIS.

The forms also include the question, ""Who recommended him?""  which may help the authorities establish a crucial link between the terrorist organization and far-flung recruiters.

Some of the recruits listed in the files are Westerners who are known to have traveled to join ISIS, Sky reports, citing several cases of high-profile British recruits who have either been killed or whose whereabouts are unknown.

News of the massive data leak comes days after German media reported that they had obtained a similar set of documents. According to Deutsche Welle, a representative of Germany's federal police says they have the documents, and that they're authentic. It's unclear whether the sets of data are the same.

Citing Germany's interior ministry, NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin, ""The ministry says the files could also undermine the ability of ISIS to recruit and inspire new fighters.""

Soraya adds, ""It's not known how many ISIS fighters are in Syria and Iraq, but estimates range between 30,000 and 100,000.""

Today, Sky reports obtaining the data on a memory stick provided by a former member of the Free Syrian Army using the name Abu Hamed, who joined ISIS but then quit because he believes the group stopped following Islamic law and is too heavily influenced by former members from Iraq's Baath party.

""It's far from Islam,"" the man tells Sky News' Stuart Ramsay, during an interview in Turkey in which he wore a scarf to obscure his face.

When asked whether the information might be used to destroy ISIS, the man answers, ""God willing, if we give it to those who will use it, of course.""

Once the administrative forms were filled out, Ramsay reports, they were given to ISIS' head of internal security, who then put the data on a memory stick.

Ramsay also says that his contact also told him that ISIS is in the process of moving its headquarters from Raqqa, Syria, to the desert and then Iraq. He also claimed that in Syria, ISIS has collaborated with President Bashar al Assad's government and other groups to fight the country's moderate opposition forces.",[]

Hot blue lightning seems to crackle, Star-Wars-Emperor-style, across the surface of The Complete Wimmen's Comix. Its title is a cheeky riff on the renaming passion that consumed feminism in the early '70s, and its two volumes come in a (actually rather ugly) salmon-colored box decorated with examples of the series' highly inconsistent artwork. The whole bulky thing feels like a suitcase bomb packed with jagged hunks of social revolution. And that energy keeps sparking throughout the 704 pages of this frenetic, anarchic, occasionally kamikaze production.

It's hard to think of an aspect of women's lives, real or fantastical, that Wimmen's Comix doesn't touch on. In 1971's ""Breaking Out,"" a cabal of female comics characters  including Little Lulu, Betty and Veronica, and Petunia Pig  rise up against sexist double standards. (Betty and Veronica picket outside the high school, demanding classes in karate and women's history.) In Joyce Farmer's 1975 ""Equal Rites,"" a dozen naked witches hold a birthing ritual to summon their forbears' spirits from outer space. Cecelia Capuana's ""Modemorphose,"" from 1985, shows women's bodies changing to reflect the strangeness of female fashion: The figures grow huge bottoms, uni-bosoms or multiple legs that stick out in all directions.

Many of the artists fantasize about crime. In 1976's ""Petite Morte,"" Joey Epstein envisions an all-woman street gang called the Tenderettes that rolls men for drug money  until one gang member develops a strange and lethal passion for their marks. In Melinda Gebbie's 1976 ""The Confectionary,"" a sex-starved woman holds up a couple, kills the woman and rapes the man. Sharon Rudahl tells of a woman helping her son escape from a Mexican jail in ""Jailbreak at Hermosillo.""

Some artists simply turn a wry eye on the mundanities of life. In 1988, Mary Fleener recalls her friendship with a self-dramatizing ""Trauma Mama."" In Teresa Richards' 1976 ""Chapstick,"" a woman fantasizes a steamy, explicit tryst on an elevator, then settles down to watch ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.""

It's genuinely painful to imagine the radical, clashing perspectives that might have been found in these pages if the collective had only reached out to more women of color.

It may be hard to see how ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"" and female-on-male rape can find homes in the same publication. But there's a strong, common current of energy unifying Wimmen's Comix. That's partly because some feminist issues, like abortion, are as fraught today as they were back in 1971. It's also because the collective seems to have remained mostly white, as far as can be judged from the photos in the introduction and the skin tone that predominates in the comics. It's genuinely painful to imagine the radical, clashing perspectives that might have been found in these pages if the collective had only reached out to more women of color.

They did reach out to a huge number of contributors  apparently regardless of artistic talent. The artwork is a total grab bag, ranging from the polished creations of Rudahl, Trina Robbins, Phoebe Gloeckner and Dot Bucher to painfully amateurish doodles by creators better left unnamed. Mixed in is subversive work in which wild, even ugly scrawls evoke an unnerving sense of chaos (Dori Seda, Diane Noomin and the perennially obstreperous Aline Kominsky-Crumb). There's even the occasional contribution from a soon-to-be-notable name (Lynda Barry, Alison Bechdel, Julie Doucet).

There's one more reason for the unity of spirit in Wimmen's Comix: These these artists, all clearly in agreement that ""the personal is political,"" are much more comfortable with the first half of that pairing. They do tackle equal pay for equal work in the publication's early years and AIDS in later ones, with a dizzying assortment of topics in between. Rape, prostitution, sexual harassment, vegetarian cooking, science fiction, gothic romances, socks, bondage, nuns, farting, motorcycles and magic all feature in these pages. There are feminist fairy tales, stories of Harriet Tubman and Julia Pastrana, the Ugliest Woman in the World, a board game, and a pointillist study of a cervix. There's even a 3-D issue (glasses included).

Still, though, these comics largely stick to the personal, to relationships and fantasies and the absurdities of everyday life. Whether it's 1971 or 1989, the contributors' favorite topics are self-definition and men, men, men. (Not to mention sex, sex, sex. Everyone is doing it in these pages, including cats and bugs.)

This says something about the nature of women and the nature of comics. It may be that, however revolutionary women's goals are, our first impulse is always to change ourselves before we take on the world at large. And it seems that no matter how talented the artist, it's just really hard to be funny about equal pay for equal work.

You might call it old wine in new bottles, but what sweet, masterfully crafted wine it is. Upheld by Stillness, the debut album by the young and vibrant British a cappella choir ORA, presents a contemporary twist on a 16th-century classic.

The group, founded in 2014 by Artistic Director Suzi Digby, asked a handful of today's choral composers to create a musical response to William Byrd's Mass for Five Voices, an intricate, richly scored polyphonic work popular with choirs around the world. Each composer took inspiration from one of the five movements of the Mass, while Byrd's original (written around 1595) forms the centerpiece of the album.

Roxanna Panufnik (daughter of the late Polish composer Andrzej Panufnik) chose Byrd's Kyrie, the traditional mass opener which pleads for God's mercy (""Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison"").

Beginning and ending in hushed reverence, Panufnik's version slowly blooms in contemporary harmonies. Voices interweave in dusky colors, pierced by strands of white light from the upper ranges of ORA's beautifully blended sopranos. Two minutes in, the piece pauses on a lovely drone from the basses, before the vocal engine chugs back up to speed  ominous and inevitable.

American intelligence officers are trained to tackle tough targets.

But there are tough targets, and then there's Russian President Vladimir Putin, who plays his cards so closely that it's hard for his own advisers to divine what he's thinking, says Gregory Treverton, chairman of the National Intelligence Council.

""Putin is so isolated that the chances that he might miscalculate and do something rash are top of my list for things I worry about,"" says Treverton. ""I am fond of distinguishing between puzzles  those things that have an answer, though we may not know it  and mysteries, those things that are iffy and contingent. And so how Putin is going to behave is presumably a mystery, and probably even a mystery to Putin.""

Treverton is not alone in this view.

Retired Adm. James Stavridis, commander of NATO forces from 2009 to 2013, says Putin is exceptional in how little he telegraphs.

""He certainly has a cabinet of close advisers,"" Stavridis says.""But at the end of the day, the strategic terrain is not on a map somewhere  it's in between Vladimir Putin's ears.""

That makes it hard for the CIA and other spy agencies charged with tracking Russian military and economic assets  and with anticipating what Moscow might do next on the conflict in Syria, tensions in Crimea and a wide range of other matters.

Stavridis, now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, points to a couple of factors that make Putin such a difficult target.

One is the degree of control he has amassed in his 17 years as either prime minister or president of Russia. You have to look to North Korea, Stavridis says, or to Fidel Castro's long reign in Cuba to find another ruler who wields such absolute power.

The tools of espionage  phone intercepts, satellite imagery and more  can sometimes overcome such disadvantages, but may be of limited use against Putin: He's a trained spy himself.

Vladimir Putin joined the KGB in 1975, and was sent to Dresden in East Germany in order to spy on the West during the Cold War. There he learned both near-flawless German and near-flawless spycraft.

""Russia has always had a very strong counterintelligence capability, and Putin would be well-schooled in this,"" says John McLaughlin, who served as acting director of the CIA in 2004, during Putin's first stint as president. McLaughlin says the aides in whom Putin might confide are mostly ex-KGB, too. ""The inner circle there would be very conscious of how they communicate, conscious of who meets whom. So it's a tough environment for intelligence.""

But McLauglin adds that if you can't peer into Putin's mind, you still can analyze the realities he's grappling with, which may inform his actions.

""In the case of Russia, you would look at the effect of sanctions, which have been very heavy on them,"" McLaughlin says. ""The fact that the ruble is now at kind of an all-time low, the fact that they have a serious capital-flight problem.""

There's also the fact that Putin has spoken openly about his overarching goal of re-establishing Russia as a major world power. It's up to the CIA and other spy agencies to figure out how he plans next to go about it.",[]

PWR BTTM is a loud, lovable duo from New York with its high-heels planted firmly in The Ramones school of rock. Ben Hopkins and Liv Bruce trade off singing, drumming and guitar  sometimes within a single song. Both Ben and Liv wrote to tell me their thoughts on the song and though their comments aren't in conflict, each one's relationship to the song feels a little different. Liv said, ""What if you threw a party and no one came? What if your friends were all at the beach and you were at the DMV? What if your crush never texted back? Maybe all you can do is focus on what you like about yourself and try to have a good time alone. This video is about taking authorship of your life, even if you can't fully control which characters stick around.""

The video was shot in an abandoned waterpark in the Mojave Desert, which connects to Ben's thought on the song, that it's about exploring nostalgia and ""unpacking how even something as complicated as a relationship between two people can be boiled down to one place or memory, so setting those feelings at a place that's frozen in the past felt like a logical fit. Plus, it was colorful.""

Director H.S. Naji ties all these ideas together. ""I planned for the term 'revisiting desolation' to be the crux of the video,"" he wrote to me. ""The location plays as all those broken promises, false hopes and crushed hearts everyone experiences. We see these two personas walk through that familiar cemetery of attractions  and at least make do with pool paraphernalia and glitter.""

The video ends with a faux film rating  Q for Queer  and a note that it may cause hot flashes and boy sweats. Consider yourself warned.

i toggle caption AP AP

Names, addresses and phone numbers of some 22,000 ISIS recruits  and information about the network that recruited them  are reportedly part of a trove of data that Sky News says it received from a former member of the extremist group.

The identities of people from more than 50 countries, including Britain, European nations, the U.S. and Canada, are purportedly in the data, which Sky says it has shared with government authorities.

""Some of the telephone numbers on the list are still active,"" Sky reports, ""and it is believed that although many will be family members, a significant number are used by the jihadis themselves.""

It's not yet clear how many of the thousands of people named in the documents might have traveled to join ISIS, and how many may still be in their home countries.

Among the most intriguing elements said to be in the data trove: 23-line recruitment forms filled out by sponsors that begin with recruits' ""name"" and ""fighter name"" and then include their mother's maiden name and their blood type. Education and job experience are also covered; so are combat experience and ""date and place of death""  implying that the paperwork was meant to follow the recruit once they've joined ISIS.

The forms also reportedly include the question, ""Who recommended him?""  which may help the authorities establish a crucial link between the terrorist organization and far-flung recruiters.

Some of the recruits listed in the files are Westerners who are known to have traveled to join ISIS, Sky reports, citing several cases of high-profile British recruits who have either been killed or whose whereabouts are unknown.

The news comes days after German media outlets reported having obtained a similar set of documents. According to Deutsche Welle, a representative of Germany's federal police says they have the documents and that they're authentic. It's unclear whether the sets of data are the same.

NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin that Germany's Interior Ministry ""says the files could also undermine the ability of ISIS to recruit and inspire new fighters.""

""It's not known how many ISIS fighters are in Syria and Iraq, but estimates range between 30,000 and 100,000,"" Soraya adds.

Sky News said it obtained the data via a memory stick provided by a former member of the Free Syrian Army using the name Abu Hamed, who joined ISIS but then quit because he believes the group stopped following Islamic law and is too heavily influenced by former members of Iraq's Baath party.

""It's far from Islam,"" the man tells Sky News' Stuart Ramsay, during an interview in Turkey in which he wore a scarf to obscure his face.

When asked whether the information might be used to destroy ISIS, the man answers, ""God willing, if we give it to those who will use it, of course.""

Once the administrative forms were filled out, Ramsay reports, they were given to ISIS' head of internal security, who then put the data on the memory stick.

Ramsay also says his contact told him that ISIS is in the process of moving its headquarters from Raqqa, Syria, to the desert and then to Iraq. He also claimed that in Syria, ISIS has collaborated with President Bashar Assad's government and other groups to fight the country's moderate opposition forces.",[]

i via YouTube via YouTube

Eric O'Grey knew he was in trouble. His weight had ballooned to 340 pounds, and he was spending more than $1,000 a month on medications for high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.

In 2010, a physician told him to buy a funeral plot, because he would need it in five years. He was 51 years old.

So he went to talk with naturopathic doctor about losing weight. She said: Get a shelter dog.

O'Grey was surprised, but he took that advice, heading to the Humane Society Silicon Valley near his home in San Jose, Calif. He told the shelter, ""I want an obese middle-aged dog, like me."" That's how he met Peety.

Peety needed to be walked, so Eric and Peety walked, for at least a half an hour a day. O'Grey, who was working as an area sales manager for GE appliances, started a plant-based diet. Over the course of a year, he lost 140 pounds. Peety lost 25. O'Grey got off the meds.

It wasn't just the walks with Peety that transformed O'Grey's life. The dog helped him from backsliding into his old unhealthful ways. ""He looked at me like I was the best person on the planet, and I wanted to become the person he thought I was.""

Their story might have ended there. But Carol Novello, president of the Humane Society Silicon Valley, had been trying to make the point that helping animals improves the lives of humans, too. She was finding that a tough sell, so she started looking for stories that made the case. ""A while ago Eric O'Grey submitted his story, and I just loved it.""

Novello, a former tech executive, asked David Whitman, executive producer of the Tech Awards of Silicon Valley, what they could do with Eric and Peety's story. He came up with the idea of the Mutual Rescue initiative, which includes a contest where people can share stories of how a shelter animal changed their lives. The winning tale gets a video made about their rescue story. Donors to the HSSV funded production of the Eric and Peety video as an example.

""It's really about the transformation and the impact that animals can have on our lives,"" Novello says.

YouTube

Since the contest opened in February the HSSV has received hundreds of stories, many of which focus on on health. ""We may do a Mutual Rescue weight loss series,"" Novello says. ""There are a lot of them.""

Sure, stories are nice, but do pets really improve human health? No less an authority than the Centers for Disease and Prevention says yes. Having a pet can help decrease blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and feelings of loneliness, the CDC says, while increasing opportunities for exercise and socializing with other humans. And there's increasing evidence that interaction with pets helps people cope with challenges including PTSD, Alzheimer's and end of life.

I know our shelter kitties make my family happier, even though they haven't help me lose weight. And watching the Eric and Peety video has to be good for my heart, though it makes me reach for the tissues every time.

""He transformed me into a completely different person,"" O'Grey says in the video. ""I think about it now; who rescued whom? Did I rescue him, or did he rescue me?""",[]

A new study confirms what many Americans already knew deep in their hearts: We're not good at math.

Not only that, when it comes to technology skills we're dead last compared with other developed countries.

The PIAAC study  the Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies  looks at the skills adults need to do everyday tasks, whether it's at work or in their social lives.

""Clearly, we have some work to do in this country,"" says Peggy Carr, the acting commissioner of the government's National Center for Education Statistics. The study compared countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Japan and Finland led the group in literacy, math and technology skills, while the United States' performance was average or well below average in each category.

Literacy

Overall, Americans' everyday literacy skills were average. But if you zoom in and focus on just the young adults, a more complex picture emerges.

Americans who went to college and graduate school did well. They scored above their peers with similar degrees in other developed countries.

For young adults with a high school diploma or less, things did not look so good. These Americans performed significantly worse than those in other countries with the same education level.

""Post-secondary institutions should be happy,"" says Carr. ""But on the other end of the continuum, we have young people coming out of high school  or not graduating from high school  that are struggling with everyday competencies.""

Math

Carr says this pattern is even more obvious if you look at the math skills of young adults. This study found that Americans with a high school diploma performed about the same as high school dropouts in other countries.

""We need to think seriously about how to get them functioning better,"" says Carr.

She offers a sample math problem from the test: You go to the store and there's a sale. Buy one, get the second half off. So if you buy two, how much do you pay?

""High school credentialed adults, they can't do this task  on average,"" says Carr.

Technology

When it comes to technology skills, the story gets worse. The U.S. came in last place  right below Poland.

The study looked at basic technology tasks: things like using email, buying and returning items online, using a drop-down menu, naming a file on a computer or sending a text message.

Across the board, Americans performed poorly on these tasks. However, there was a significant racial difference with non-whites scoring below whites.

""I don't think we were particularly shocked by that finding,"" says Carr. She points out that these racial differences are similar to what other national and international studies have found.

She says these findings should be concerning to everyone, especially leaders in the business community and in the K-12 school systems.",[]

A curious crowd lingered around Amal Graafstra as he carefully unpacked a pair of gloves, a small sterile blanket and a huge needle. A long line of people were waiting to get tiny computer chips implanted into their hands.

Graafstra had set up shop in a booth in the middle of an exhibit hall at the Austin Convention Center, where he gathered last month with several hundred others who call themselves ""body hackers""  people who push the boundaries of implantable technology to improve the human body.

The movement evokes visceral reactions, brings up safety and ethical concerns and quickly veers into sci-fi questions about the line between human and cyborg.

Graafstra is a pioneer in the space. Using his own body to experiment, he designed bio-safe magnets and the microchip he was about to implant into the hand of A.J. Butt, who was sporting a tall, blue mohawk.

toggle caption Eyder Peralta/NPR

The implantable RFID chips hold encrypted information, and their unique ID numbers can be used to open doors or unlock the owner's smartphone, which is what Butt wants to do.

Butt took a deep breath. The needle plunged into his skin at the base of his thumb, and a chip bigger than a grain of rice slipped just below the surface.

Across the way, Sasha Rose, who was working a meditation booth at the convention, watched the people line up to be ""chipped.""

She shook her head: This was the craziest thing she had seen. She wondered about Graafstra's credentials. She thought this was a medical procedure, so should he be performing it? Did his clients know the potential consequences of carrying personal information on a device inside their skin?

""More than the crazy concept, it's actually people's willingness to accept it. That's why it's crazy to me,"" Rose said. ""People are just willing to just line up and go, 'Yeah, stick that in me.' ""

At night, many of the convention goers gathered at a club on Austin's 6th Street.

Graafstra was outside with Ryan O'Shea, whose company Grindhouse Wetware made the Internet squirm earlier this year when it released a close-up surgery video of one of its implants called Northstar. In it, a man gets a small incision in his hand and then, with a metallic tool dipped into it, the skin is lifted to produce a cavity where a round subdermal implant with five LED lights is placed.

The result looks dystopian  the incision is stitched with black thread, and LED lights make the skin on the hand glow red.

But body hackers view the world differently, Graafstra said. They believe technology has reached a point where it can improve the human body instead of just fixing what's broken.

toggle caption Eyder Peralta/NPR

""A patient may someday come very soon and say, 'My eye is totally fine, but I want an eye that can see infrared. And I want an eye that can zoom,' "" Graafstra said.

That kind of future  where the human body is augmented by technology  is the goal of many of these experiments.

O'Shea said Grindhouse Wetware is using its LED device to test how long a device like it can remain charged inside a body, and Graafstra said his RFID chip is a small attempt at merging digital identity with physical identity.

""I think once people realize, 'Oh, it's OK that my grandma has a pacemaker' ... people are going to start to accept this,"" O'Shea said. ""You know, the era of transhumanism, I would say, is here. So let's accept that and then see where that logically takes us.""

Inside the club, a drone hovered above the dance floor. The polished steel and the electronic dance music gave it a futuristic feel.

Standing near the bar was Tony Salvador, who studies social values and how they affect technology at Intel. He was at the conference to get a feel of when and if ""body hacking"" may be accepted into the mainstream.

If we define ourselves as organisms, suddenly our group is wider.

Sometimes, he said, technology moves too fast and outpaces accepted social boundaries  not to mention laws. He argued that was part of the reason why early wearers of Google Glass were called ""glassholes.""

""It created a social misunderstanding,"" Salvador said. ""You didn't know what was going on.""

To Salvador, the boundaries of acceptance are a matter of our social philosophy, an area that he argued was driven by esoteric discourse without tangible moral and ethical recommendations.

The philosophers, he said, are letting us down.

Alva Noe, a philosopher at the University of California, Berkeley, and contributor to NPR's 13.7: Cosmos and Culture blog, has written extensively on what he calls ""cyborgian naturalness."" He disagreed that the modern philosophers dropped the ball, saying that tackling the matter would involve unpacking two questions:

Is it OK to cut into human bodies for these kinds of experiments? How much tolerance should society have for artificially enhancing the body?

To the first question, Noe said he found the ""body hacking"" experimentation on humans ""ethically disturbing"" and couldn't fathom a doctor or any other scientists conducting these kinds of operations.

The second question was more complicated.

""We don't condemn people for using glasses to see better,"" he said. ""But we do start to think taking speed to cope with your work life is questionable.""

Because those kinds of judgments are an ethical question, drawing a tolerance line may always be a moving target, he said.

""We may reach consensuses and then lose them,"" Noe said. ""Just as there was once a consensus where it was OK to smoke to function effectively, and now we have the consensus that, increasingly, it's not OK to do that.""

If there's a rock star in the body hacking movement, that's Neil Harbisson, a colorblind artist from Barcelona, who persuaded a doctor to implant a camera in the back of his head. The antenna, as he calls it, essentially lets Harbisson listen to colors by detecting the dominant color in front of him and translating it into musical notes.

toggle caption Luis Ortiz/LatinContent/Getty Images

The way he tells it, a medical ethics committee in Europe had refused to sign off on the operation but a doctor agreed to perform the surgery anonymously. From it, Harbisson emerged with a camera connected to a device on the back of his skull, its lens dangling in front of his face on a rod that arcs over his head.

As he walked the streets of Austin, he described how he perceived the world: the red traffic light sounded like an A note, the green grass sounded like an F.

In his keynote address at the conference, Harbisson said the first time he heard those colors in his sleep, he felt truly cyborg. Now, he no longer identifies as human, but a ""cybernetic organism.""

""If we define ourselves as organisms, suddenly our group is wider,"" he said. ""We are on the same level as an insect, or as a cat, or as a plant.""

Harbisson is well aware of how the world perceives him. He moved from Barcelona to New York City in search of ""peace"" with another friend in the transhumanist movement, Moon Ribas. Ribas has an electronic device in her arm that she said vibrates when there is an earthquake anywhere in the world.

On more than one occasion, people have tried to rip off his antenna, Harbisson said. That's part of the reason why he co-founded the Cyborg Foundation to advocate for ""cyborg rights.""

When asked if he's ever thought about just taking the antenna off, Harbisson demurred.

""To me, it's much stronger, the wish to sense what's around me than the fact that people keep annoying me,"" he said, adding that maybe, in the future, as others get new senses, he'll be considered normal.",[]

China's economy isn't doing too well these days, but you wouldn't know it from the government's real estate transaction center in Shanghai's Baoshan district. Hundreds of people jam the office every day to put in paperwork for homes they've just purchased. The crowds are so loud and anxious that guards wearing white hardhats and wielding bullhorns patrol the lines to keep order.

In January, home prices in Shanghai were up by more than 15 percent from a year earlier, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. In the southern city of Shenzhen, prices have jumped by more than 50 percent in the past 12 months.

i toggle caption Frank Langfitt/NPR Frank Langfitt/NPR

""Originally, I didn't plan to buy at this particular time, but now prices have forced me to,"" says a construction worker surnamed Zhang, 50, speaking over the din of the crowd at the transaction center. ""If I don't buy now, future prices will be more unbearable.""

Sitting next to him is Anna Zhang, no relation, who feels the same way. Zhang, who is 27 and works for an export company, has just bought her first home with her husband. The apartment, which is less than 600 square feet, cost the couple more than $200,000, most of which they borrowed from a bank. That's a lot of money in a city where the average annual salary is about $14,000, according to Zhaopin.com, a job recruitment portal.

Anna Zhang says she had no intention of spending so much, but had no choice.

""I would call a homeowner in the morning and he'd offer one price,"" she says. ""When I called him back in the afternoon, there was another price. This happened twice and [the] price jumped anywhere from $7,500 to $15,000.""

Home prices are rising in top-tier cities, including Beijing and Guangzhou, at a time when China's economic growth continues to slow and currency and stock prices remain down. GDP growth was 6.9 percent last year, the lowest rate in a quarter-century. The Shanghai composite has dropped by about 45 percent since its high in June.

What gives? Oliver Rui, who teaches finance at China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, says rising home prices are not a sign of confidence in the economy  but of uncertainty. Many small and mid-size business owners are pouring money into Shanghai real estate because they see it as a safe haven for their capital.

""They think that the outlook of the economy is not clear,"" says Rui. ""They don't want to further invest in their business, so the best way to hedge against inflation is real estate.""

That's because, historically, real estate in top Chinese cities has been a sure bet. If you bought an apartment in downtown Shanghai in, say, the year 2000, you might have seen the value rise 10 times.

Rui, though, warns that continuing to pour money into China's real estate sector isn't good for the economy in the long run. It sidelines capital that could be better used to build a more nimble, innovative economic model that could create better jobs with higher wages.

While China's wealthiest cities are enjoying price runs, huge swaths of apartments in so-called second-, third- and fourth-tier cities in the country's interior are gathering dust. At the end of last year, there were about 182 square miles worth of unsold residential floor space, according to the Chinese government. That's more than the area of Philadelphia.

China's government has cut deed taxes and reduced down payment requirements to try to sell off some of this white-elephant inventory  but many Chinese have neither the cash nor the desire to buy in smaller cities.

""There's a concern that in the future, there will be fewer and fewer policy measures available to get people to buy this housing,"" said Lu Wenxi, a researcher with Centaline, a leading real estate company operating in China. ""If the market weakens further, we'll eventually use up all the tools in our toolbox.""

Officials in the northeastern rust-belt city of Shenyang recently considered offering college graduates housing loans with no down payment. In a culture known for thrift, this sort of sub-prime scheme drew howls online, and the local government put plans on hold.

""That indicates in certain areas,"" says Rui, ""the local government is desperate.""",[]

It was a veiled reference to Donald Trump's private parts. Wright nixed the debate, telling her disappointed son the candidates ""weren't acting like adults.""

As parents like Wright are tuning in to this year's presidential campaign  and the mudslinging, racial comments and sexual innuendo that come with it  they are struggling with how much to show their kids, and how to explain it all.

If you've missed the debates, here's a taste (courtesy of All Things Considered):

Though indecent language seems to have reached a fever pitch on the Republican side, the Democrats have had their share of shouting and interrupting too.

""They should have ratings at the front of the debates,"" Wright laughs. ""You know, 'Contains language, and violence, and sexual content.' That might be helpful for parents.""

For the next debate, Wright says she might pre-screen, so she can fast forward through any inappropriate parts. When she does let her four children watch, Wright tries to find lessons where she can.

""We say, 'Hey, look how he's mean or bullying to this person. That's not how you talk to someone.' Or, 'See how he doesn't really answer the person's question, he just picks on him instead? That's not how you debate.""

Her 10-year-old son Houston isn't sure whether he should be surprised by the language in these debates.

""It's hard to say,"" he says. ""I knew there would be a lot of yelling and shouting. I guess I'm kind of used to it now.""

In Louisville, Ky., Laura Hall's 13-year-old son takes part in mock government at school, and is also paying close attention to the campaign. Normally she would welcome this real-time civics education, but this year she's not so sure.

""In a way it makes me sad that, at this pivotal point in his development, this is what he's seeing,"" Hall says. ""To see some of the candidates moving ahead and gaining support through bad behavior and hateful speech.""

She's a Democrat, but wants to teach her son respect for all candidates. The seventh grader will be old enough to vote in the next presidential election, and she wonders if this season will affect his long term view of the parties.

Hall felt the need for a teachable moment last week, after a Trump rally in Louisville. A video that got a lot of local coverage, and went viral online, shows an older white man helping to expel an African-American woman who was protesting.

""Pushing her and shoving her, and they were screaming at her,"" Hall says, ""and it was really horrible to see. It's important that the kids understand that that happens, and it's not acceptable.""

Hall's son Benjamin has noticed the crowds at debates as well.

""The people are kind of egging them on,"" he says. ""Because I've seen clips where they'll say something rude to one another, and you'll hear everybody cheer and laugh. And that's not a good example for bystanding.""

At Sherwood Githens Middle School in Durham, N.C., eighth grader Samori Reed-Bandele follows the campaign on social media. He says all the candidates' name-calling doesn't seem very presidential.

""I just feel as though it's real childish,"" he says, ""and I don't think grown adults should be acting like us.""

He and some classmates say they're studying the campaign in school, writing papers on heated topics that have come up, like immigration. Eighth grader Michelle Terron Azamar's parents are from Mexico. She says her family felt hurt when Trump compared Mexican immigrants to rapists and criminals.

""I've been really offended,"" she said. ""That's his opinion if he wants to not like Hispanics, or whatever he doesn't like. But I just think he shouldn't take it out on us.""

Terron Azamar said her dad, who has not discussed politics with her much in the past, has been talking to her a lot about this year's campaign, and telling her that Trump will not win in a general election.

Others parents say they're more worried about how children are hearing and relaying Trump's discussion of mass deportation and building a border wall.

""Last week, my kindergartner son told me that a class friend of his expressed to him with tears in her eyes, 'If Trump becomes president, we'll have to move. He doesn't like our family,'"" says Brent Seavers of Northern California, in a Facebook posting. ""That, to me, is a bigger concern than the name-calling. That is doing real psychological damage to innocent children.""

Alejandra Abella, who teaches middle school debate in Ventura County, Calif., said she's using the debates as an example  but not usually a good one. ""Unfortunately, I have been able to pull more examples of what should not be done in debating than examples of what should be done,"" she said.

At first, when Abella showed the class video clips from Republican debates, she was horrified. She teaches Lincoln-Douglas style, in which debaters base their arguments on ethical values.

""Honestly, these moments in the debates in which they're hearing lots of words and absolutely no substance, are helping them understand, 'Why do we look for value in Lincoln Douglas debates?'"" she said, ""And it's helping them focus on that.""

She sees it as a silver lining, show kids they can learn from even a negative example.",[]

i toggle caption Geoff Robbins/AFP/Getty Images Geoff Robbins/AFP/Getty Images

The remaining four Republican candidates debate once again tonight in Miami. Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich will be on the stage together for the last time before next Tuesday's big primary night when voters in Ohio and Florida  Rubio and Kasich's home states  go to the polls. Tuesday is a make or break night for the two of them and tonight's debate is the last chance they have to change the dynamic in a race that has not been going their way.

Here are four things to watch  one for each candidate.

1. How will Trump behave?

Lately the front runner has been trying to appear more ""presidential,"" holding press conferences instead of rallies after his primary wins to project more gravitas. In the last debate, he announced that he was flexible and would change his positions if necessary in order to break the gridlock in Washington. But that was just minutes before  and after  he talked about the size of his hands and a certain part of his anatomy. So we're not sure which Trump will show up tonight  the one who calls his opponents stupid, fat, losers, or the one who promised on Tuesday night: ""I can be more presidential than anybody other than the great Abe Lincoln. He was very presidential, right?""

2. Does Cruz punch up or down?

Cruz is in the number two spot  only about 100 delegates behind Donald Trump. He has the strongest case to make that if the nominee is not going to be Trump, it should be him. Some establishment Republicans in the #nevertrump movement are coming around to the idea that as much as they dislike Cruz he might be their only choice. Lindsay Graham, no fan of Cruz's, says it may be time to rally around the Texas senator. Still, Cruz has a total of ZERO endorsements from his fellow senators.

Tonight, does Cruz use his formidable debating skills to try again, to cut Trump down to size, or does he attack Rubio and Kasich, whose continued presence in the race prevent him from consolidating the anti-Trump vote?

3. Rubio on the ropes

Now that Jeb Bush has left the race, Rubio has become Trump's preferred punching bag. Rubio tried undermining Trump with insults but that didn't work. Trump needled him about this on Tuesday night, helpfully pointing out that, ""hostility works for some people . It doesn't work for everybody, O.K.? ""

Rubio has the most to lose next week. If he doesn't win his home state of Florida, he will not only give up any shred of viability as a candidate, he could also hurt his political career going forward. Unlike Cruz and Kasich, who have day jobs they can keep, Rubio gave up his Senate seat to run for president and is not running for reelection in the fall.

4. Kasich needs to win something

Kasich has an even worse record in this primary than Rubio, who won in Minnesota and Puerto Rico. Kasich hasn't won anywhere. Tuesday was a disappointment for Kasich. He came in third in Michigan, which is a rust belt state like his own Ohio. Kasich once had hopes of winning there or placing a strong second.

Trump is beating him in the polls in Ohio and Kasich has said that if he doesn't win his home state he's done. So, tonight, what does Kasich do to claw his way back into contention? Does he continue his ""Mr. Nice Guy"" strategy, showing voters that he's a reasonable, not very partisan, not very angry candidate who is as fed up with the antics of his opponents as they are? Or does he actually try to take on Trump?

Granted, that hasn't worked for anyone else but there's not much time left.",[]

Pope Francis is cracking down on the money machine that powers the sainthood process, months after two Italian journalists published books alleging jaw-dropping financial mismanagement at the Vatican.

Those working on the process of canonization and beatification will now have to provide regular accounting of where money is being spent, and a new fund will be opened to provide resources for cash-strapped sainthood campaigns.

The steep cost of saint-making, and the lack of oversight and transparency that surround the process, were two of the immediately controversial revelations in Emanuele Fittipaldi's Avarice and, especially, Gianluigi Nuzzi's Merchants in the Temple. Both books were published in November.

In his book, which draws heavily on anonymous sources and allegedly leaked documents, Nuzzi estimates that the cost of sainthood at the Vatican regularly ran about half a million euros  more than half a million dollars.

The fact that beatification and canonization would be expensive isn't, by itself, astonishing. Catholic sainthood is a lengthy process, involving years of research and reams of paper to document and analyze the would-be saint's life, beliefs and reported miracles. (As an example of the scale involved: Remember Junipero Serra, who was canonized last year? The process of granting him sainthood began in the 1940s and involved accumulating approximately 10,000 pages of source material and writing a 1,200-page positio, or position paper, explaining the justification for his canonization.)

But Nuzzi alleged that the process was both unfair and shockingly unsupervised. The Catholic Herald says wealthy donors could essentially bankroll their selected candidate for sainthood, while potential saints who didn't have deep-pocketed supporters would not have the funds for the necessary research.

Leftover money from well-supported sainthood campaigns was supposed to go into a fund to help poorer candidates, but somehow it seemed there was never any spare cash, no matter how flush a sainthood ""cause"" was, Nuzzi writes.

Where did that money go? It wasn't clear, Nuzzi said, writing that many postulators  the people who spearhead the canonization of a given candidate for sainthood  weren't keeping track of how the money was spent. No budgets, no expense reports, no financial statements.

Nuzzi's book depicts Francis as a determined reformer, fighting to transform a ""saint's factory"" that resists his attempts at oversight. In fact, the journalist describes a shocked Vatican freezing the bank accounts of offending postulators once they discovered the sheer amount of money being spent without any bookkeeping.

After he and Fittipaldi (who wrote extensively about misdirected donations) published their books, Pope Francis assigned a fact-finding commission to investigate how the Vatican spent money, The Associated Press reports.

That internal investigation led to the new financial rules.

Now, postulators will be required to document how they spend money  and set budgets for their projects. Their bank accounts will be subject to oversight.

There will be ""disciplinary procedures in case of misuse,"" Vatican Radio reports, and a process for liquidating funds once a saint is canonized or the campaign is dropped.

And a new ""solidarity fund,"" with set processes for adding and distributing money, will be established to help the causes of sainthood candidates who lack wealthy supporters.",[]

i Daniel Haskett/Corbis Daniel Haskett/Corbis

A new study confirms what many Americans already knew deep in their hearts: We're not good at math.

Not only that, when it comes to technology skills we're dead last compared with other developed countries.

The PIAAC study  the Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies  looks at the skills adults need to do everyday tasks, whether it's at work or in their social lives.

""Clearly, we have some work to do in this country,"" says Peggy Carr, the acting commissioner of the government's National Center for Education Statistics. The study compared countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Japan and Finland led the group in literacy, math and technology skills, while the United States' performance was average or well below average in each category.

Literacy

Overall, Americans' everyday literacy skills were average. But if you zoom in and focus on just the young adults, a more complex picture emerges.

Americans who went to college and graduate school did well. They scored above their peers with similar degrees in other developed countries.

For young adults with a high school diploma or less, things did not look so good. These Americans performed significantly worse than those in other countries with the same education level.

""Post-secondary institutions should be happy,"" says Carr. ""But on the other end of the continuum, we have young people coming out of high school  or not graduating from high school  that are struggling with everyday competencies.""

Math

Carr says this pattern is even more obvious if you look at the math skills of young adults. This study found that Americans with a high school diploma performed about the same as high school dropouts in other countries.

""We need to think seriously about how to get them functioning better,"" says Carr.

She offers a sample math problem from the test: You go to the store and there's a sale. Buy one, get the second half off. So if you buy two, how much do you pay?

""High school credentialed adults, they can't do this task  on average,"" says Carr.

Technology

When it comes to technology skills, the story gets worse. The U.S. came in last place  right below Poland.

The study looked at basic technology tasks: things like using email, buying and returning items online, using a drop-down menu, naming a file on a computer or sending a text message.

Across the board, Americans performed poorly on these tasks. However, there was a significant racial difference with non-whites scoring below whites.

""I don't think we were particularly shocked by that finding,"" says Carr. She points out that these racial differences are similar to what other national and international studies have found.

She says these findings should be concerning to everyone, especially leaders in the business community and in the K-12 school systems.",[]

i via YouTube via YouTube

Eric O'Grey knew he was in trouble. His weight had ballooned to 320 pounds, and he was spending more than $1,000 a month on medications for high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.

In 2010, a physician told him to buy a funeral plot, because he would need it in five years. He was 51 years old.

So he went to talk with naturopathic doctor about losing weight. She said: Get a shelter dog.

O'Grey was surprised, but he took that advice, heading to the Humane Society Silicon Valley near his home in San Jose, Calif. He told the shelter, ""I want an obese middle-aged dog, like me."" That's how he met Peety.

Peety needed to be walked, so Eric and Peety walked, for at least a half an hour a day. O'Grey, who was working as an area sales manager for GE appliances, shifted to a plant-based diet. Over the course of a year, he lost 140 pounds. Peety lost 25. O'Grey got off the meds.

It wasn't just the walks with Peety that transformed O'Grey's life. The dog helped keep him from backsliding into his old unhealthful ways. ""He looked at me like I was the best person on the planet, and I wanted to become the person he thought I was.""

Their story might have ended there. But Carol Novello, president of the Humane Society Silicon Valley, had been trying to make the point that helping animals improves the lives of humans, too. She was finding that a tough sell, so she started looking for stories that made the case. ""A while ago Eric O'Grey submitted his story, and I just loved it.""

Novello, a former tech executive, asked David Whitman, executive producer of the Tech Awards of Silicon Valley, what they could do with Eric and Peety's story. He came up with the idea of the Mutual Rescue initiative, which includes a contest where people can share stories of how a shelter animal changed their lives. The winning tale gets a video made about their rescue story. Donors to the HSSV funded production of the Eric and Peety video as an example.

""It's really about the transformation and the impact that animals can have on our lives,"" Novello says.

YouTube

Since the contest opened in February the HSSV has received hundreds of stories, many of which focus on health. ""We may do a Mutual Rescue weight loss series,"" Novello says. ""There are a lot of them.""

Sure, stories are nice, but do pets really improve human health? No less an authority than the Centers for Disease and Prevention says yes. Having a pet can help decrease blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and feelings of loneliness, the CDC says, while increasing opportunities for exercise and socializing with other humans. And there's increasing evidence that interaction with pets helps people cope with challenges including PTSD, Alzheimer's and the end of life.

I know our shelter kitties make my family happier, even though they haven't help me lose weight. And watching the Eric and Peety video has to be good for my heart, though it makes me reach for the tissues every time.

""He transformed me into a completely different person,"" O'Grey says in the video. ""I think about it now; who rescued whom? Did I rescue him, or did he rescue me?""",[]

YouTube

Carolina Chelele is a contestant on a popular reality TV show. But it's not about dating, housewives or survival. It's about ... farming. Specifically farming by females.



She and her competitors have each been given a bag of mortar and a single seed. The cameras are rolling. Thousands of dollars in prizes are on the line. The producers ask them: How do you plant it?

Ready? Set? Go!

Some farmers planted the seed directly in the mortar (in case you're not sure what mortar is, it's a mix of sand and cement). Others mixed the mortar with soil or mud. But Chelele, 49, sat back. She didn't touch the stuff.

""This challenge is impossible,"" she said.

She was correct, of course  you can't plant a seed in mortar. Water would just make it harden and set around the seed, which would have no room to grow.

Chelele's agricultural smarts (and common sense) helped her beat 14 other women farmers and win season 5 of Tanzanian's Female Food Heroes last August.

The show, sponsored by the international charity Oxfam, was created to show Africans just how valuable hard-working, experienced women farmers like Chelele are  even though they're not reaching their full potential.

Women make up 53 percent of Tanzania's small crop producers, but produce, on average, 14 percent fewer crops per acre than plots managed by men  which means they earn less money. This is because they lack access to credit, labor and fertilizer, factors essential to productivity, according to a report from the One Campaign and the World Bank.

Despite the serious subtext, Female Food Heroes takes a lighthearted approach. The farmers compete in all kinds of tasks over a 21-day period: selling goods on the side of the road, repairing mud walls and vaccinating goats. Viewers help determine the winner by voting for their favorite contestants.

Since the TV version of the program, Mama Shujaa wa Chakula, began airing in Tanzania in 2011, the show, in partnership with East Africa TV, has reached about 37 million viewers throughout the region, says Oxfam. And each season, nearly 3,000 female farmers vie for one of the 18 to 20 spots on the TV show.

The idea for the initiative came about after campaigners at a regional Oxfam meeting in Africa decided they needed to change how people were talking about female farmers. ""A lot of what we were doing for smallholder women farmers wasn't having an impact,"" says Eluka Kibona, who manages Oxfam's involvement with the show.

They wanted less of a ""pity party"" and more of a ""celebration that would give them the status they deserve,"" she adds.

And that's exactly what the program is doing: transforming African women farmers into advocates for agriculture issues.

Chelele, who won season five of Female Food Heroes in Tanzania, has become a community leader. In addition to the grand prize, which included about $10,000, 7 acres of land, and farming and fishing tools, she says in an email to NPR that she has ""generated a small amount of fame, which is wonderful.""

Now that she's a winner, the mother of four and the sole provider for her household educates people and family members in her village about different farming methods. A few times a month, she goes on the local radio station. People call in and ask her about her experiences as a farmer and a women's rights advocate. She answers questions like ""How do I learn to make manure?"" ""How did I modernize my farming technique?"" and of course, ""How do I get on the show?""

Since the television show began in Tanzania, Female Food Heroes competitions and award ceremonies  which Oxfam describes as kind of like a ""beauty pageant""  have been held in Ethiopia and Nigeria. But the program, which started in 2012, has its own set of winners, judges and contestants. Unfortunately, it's not aired on TV.

The contestants don't seem to mind  they're just glad they have a chance to win. Monica Maigari, an energetic 59-year-old farmer, was the first-runner up in Nigeria's 2014 Female Food Heroes challenge.

On top of winning $1,000, which she used to buy land, there are other perks. She's currently in Washington, D.C., helping Oxfam lobby Congress on U.S. legislation to improve global humanitarian response and give local groups the tools and resources they need to act when disaster strikes  an idea that Maigari can stand behind.

And now that she's become a leader in her village  where ""even the men"" respect her, she says  she will use her power to help women farmers. She wants them to learn how to read and write, learn how to use the machines that will pack their food in containers for supermarkets, and get their foodstuffs registered and vetted in Nigeria's version of the FDA.

Don't even get her started on mangoes. ""They drop down and we cannot preserve them, they just go to waste,"" she says. ""It's a serious problem. They rot and we cannot sell them at the market.""

Maigari, who visited NPR this week, noticed our building's rooftop garden, looking pretty dead thanks to winter, and happily gave us some good advice.

She likes that our box garden is ""well-manured,"" and says it would be great for carrots, tomatoes and spinach. But no more than four kinds of crops, she says  that way NPR can ""grow enough to sell at the market.""",[]

i toggle caption PeopleImages.com/Getty Images PeopleImages.com/Getty Images

By the time they're in elementary school, some kids prove to be more troublesome than others. They can't sit still or they're not socializing or they can't focus enough to complete tasks that the other kids are handling well. Sounds like ADHD. But it might be that they're just a little young for their grade.

Studies done in several countries including Iceland, Canada, Israel, Sweden and Taiwan show children who are at the young end of their grade cohort are more likely to get an ADHD diagnosis than their older classmates.

The youngest students were between 20 percent and 100 percent more likely to get the diagnosis or ADHD medication than were the oldest students in the cohort, says Helga Zoega, an epidemiologist at the University of Iceland who worked on the Icelandic and Israeli studies.

The most recent evidence comes from Taiwan, where an analysis showed the youngest students in a grade were roughly 75 percent more likely to get a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder than the oldest ones. It was published Thursday in the Journal of Pediatrics.

Kids are generally 6 years old when they start first grade. A scant few months can span a lot of mental growth at this age.

""Within that age range there is a huge difference in developmental and social and emotional maturity,"" says Dr. Adiaha Spinks-Franklin, a developmental and behavioral pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital who was not involved in any of the studies. ""A 6-year-old is just not the same as a 7-year-old.""

And yet a first grader might stand shoulder to shoulder with another student nearly 12 months her elder. ""And the way we diagnose ADHD is we talk to the parent about the child's behavior, and we mail the teacher questionnaires,"" Spinks-Franklin says. ""The teacher will be comparing the child's behavior relative to other children in the class.""

That could lead to a mistaken diagnosis of ADHD. Zoega says the younger the student, the greater the likelihood that student will receive an ADHD diagnosis or medication. ""If you look at the [students' age] just month by month, you'll see that the likelihood increases with each month,"" she says.

Zoega says the only country studied so far where the relative age of young children doesn't seem to have an effect on ADHD diagnosis is Denmark, where there's more flexibility for when children enter school. So this could be because Danish parents with kids who are born just before the cutoff date for grade school entry choose to hold their offspring back one year.

But if you're an American parent with children born in the months of December, November or October, that doesn't mean a child should repeat a grade for the fear their relative youth will handicap them, Spinks-Franklin says. ""There is absolutely no data to support grade repetition for maturity issues. Children who repeat a grade are at a higher risk of dropping out of high school. They are more likely to be bullied."" If the child does have ADHD or another disorder, she notes, repeating a grade will not fix the disorder.

And relatively younger children diagnosed with ADHD might really have ADHD, says Dr. Mu-Hong Chen, a psychiatrist at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. ""There's a potential for the harm of overdiagnosis and overprescription."" That would unnecessarily subject kids to unwanted side effects of stimulant medication and the stigma of the disorder. But perhaps older, more mature-looking students are just being underdiagnosed and not get help they might need, he says. The studies didn't look into that.

The best thing for worried parents to do is just give the kids a chance to grow up, Chen says. In most of the studies done on relative age and ADHD, the difference in diagnosis rates vanished by the time the students reached their teenage years. ""I think we have to wait for a while, he says. ""We have to have more time to evaluate their behavior, attention and brain development.""

The data also mean that doctors should take the child's relative age into account when diagnosing ADHD, Zoega says. ""It has a sensible solution. Just treat the individual according to his or her age.""",[]

In 2003, Mark and Jay Duplass decided to make a $3 movie  the cost of a mini-DVR tape from a nearby 7-Eleven  which resulted in a short film called ""This Is John."" The short, about a guy trying to create an outgoing message on his answering machine, was accepted into the Sundance Film Festival and quickly launched the careers of the Duplass Brothers.

This was by no means their first filmmaking endeavor. Mark and Jay Duplass started making movies together when they were kids, and continued filmmaking at the University of Texas, with minimal success. ""We had tried to be the Coen Brothers in the early 90s, but we failed miserably because they're the Coen Brothers,"" Jay tells Ask Me Another host Ophira Eisenberg at the Bell House in Brooklyn, NY.

Whether they are producing, directing, writing, or acting, the Duplass Brothers have been involved in an astonishing number of projects, including Cyrus and Jeff, Who Lives At Home. On screen, you might recognize Mark from TBS's The League and Jay from Amazon Video's Transparent, which was Jay's first major role in front of the camera. More recently, the brothers co-created the HBO series Togetherness, also starring Mark, which follows two detached couples living and coping in Los Angeles. The character-driven dramedy focuses on themes of marriage and friendship, drawing upon the brothers' lives.

""When we are writing and directing and producing, sometimes acting in one of our things, it really is like being a parent,"" Mark explains to Eisenberg, ""When we are acting in other shows, it's like being the drunk uncle who shows up with Oreos and plays with the children, but then goes home and doesn't have to deal with everything.""

While other kids were obsessing over Star Wars, the Duplass Brothers were watching hard-hitting, emotional dramas, like Ordinary People, and pretty much anything that aired on daytime HBO in the '80s. For their VIP game, we quiz the siblings on this knowledge, specifically of Academy Award Best Picture Nominees from 1976-1985.

Highlights

On their childhood filmmaking days

Jay: A lot of filmmakers' films from their younger days are prophetic of future genius...ours was not.

Mark: The first [film] was the invisible man walking across the room, where we would move the shoes one foot in front of the other and film them a couple of seconds at a time. And BLOW people's minds. The second one was a remake of The Blob where our blue bean bag just rolled down the stairs.

On their relationship

Mark: We don't fight a lot and we have actually talked about it. We're wondering if maybe we should fight more and we've talked about going to therapy so that we do fight more.

Jay: Try some yelling and screaming.

Mark: We're worried that we're repressing some stuff.

On their breakout success

Jay: We were kind of ready to throw in the towel. I was pushing thirty and was like, ""I got to stop torturing myself and our family with this 'artist' thing."" So, Mark was like, ""Let's just make a movie today."" The story was something that happened to me the day before. I was trying to record a greeting on my answering machine. It was a $3 movie that got into Sundance and did more for our careers than the previous 10 years of trying to be the Coen Brothers.

Mark: And now...as you can see...we own blazers!

Jay: We don't even have to buy these blazers. People give us blazers!",[]

For the second time in as many days, Go champion Lee Sedol fished out one of the playing stones he'd captured from his opponent and placed it back on the board, admitting defeat against the computer program AlphaGo, which now has a 2-0 lead in their best-of-five series.

Lee and AlphaGo will now take a one-day break before continuing their match Saturday. Lee must win the next three games in order to win.

""Yesterday I was surprised, but today, more than that, I'm quite speechless,"" Lee said after the match, according to Go Game Guru. Lee, a multiple winner of world titles, then added, ""... there was not a moment in time where I felt that I was leading the game.""

When asked later about AlphaGo's weaknesses in the board game in which players compete for territory, Sedol answered that he had yet to find any.

YouTube

This game lacked some of the hard-hitting exchanges of the first, with several analysts agreeing that in round two, Lee took a more cautious approach while AlphaGo showed more creativity than on Wednesday. Both sides used some of their allotted overtime, after going through their two-hour periods in the second game  a contest that lasted for 211 moves compared to 186 in game one.

At one point, an unusual decision by AlphaGo, to place a stone near one of Lee's white pieces where little action seemed to be taking place, ""made human champion Lee leave his seat to take a break, or likely to pull himself together after the unconventional move,"" the Korea Herald reports.

Michael Redmond, an elite Go player who's commenting on the games for the Google DeepMind channel on YouTube, said:

""I was impressed with AlphaGo's play. There was a great beauty to the opening. Based on what I had seen from its other games, AlphaGo was always strong in the end and middle game, but that was extended to the beginning game this time. It was a beautiful, innovative game.""

The challenge between Lee and AlphaGo carries a prize of around $1 million, and it has spurred interest in Go, a game that was developed in China centuries ago and is now played by tens of millions of people.

Here's how the American Go Association describes the philosophy behind the game, which has fewer rules than chess but has many more potential variations for how pieces are arranged on the board:

""There is no simple procedure to turn a clear lead into a victory  only continued good play. The game rewards patience and balance over aggression and greed; the balance of influence and territory may shift many times in the course of a game, and a strong player must be prepared to be flexible but resolute. Go thinking seems more lateral than linear, less dependent on logical deduction, and more reliant on a 'feel' for the stones, a 'sense' of shape, a gestalt perception of the game.""

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, whose company created AlphaGo, called Thursday's game ""excruciatingly nerve-wracking""  and he also said that more than 100 million people worldwide had watched the first match online.

i toggle caption Keystone/Getty Images Keystone/Getty Images

I'd already been thinking a lot about George Martin. I've spent the last year writing a book about the songs that changed the lives of musicians, and in the introductory chapter I offer my own selection. ""A Day in the Life,"" by The Beatles, changed the way I think about music. It's a song George Martin, who died on Tuesday at the age of 90, had a clear hand in.

George Martin was 36 when he began working with The Beatles in 1962, a decade and a half older than Paul and John. When you think of rock music of that time, it was basically this: guitar, bass, drums and a few singers. Song structures were simply an intro, a verse, a chorus that might repeat, and often not more than that. Music was for fun, something to sing along to, a bit of comfort when life got you down. The sound of rock and roll, with little exception, was predictable, albeit lovable. When you think of the progression of the music from the end of 1963, when I first heard ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" on the radio, to less than four years later, when The Beatles, with Martin, created and released Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, it's simply mind boggling.

George Martin's skills as an arranger are on all of The Beatles albums: the strings on ""Yesterday,"" a trumpet on ""Penny Lane"" and the crazy brass and strings on ""I Am The Walrus"" are just a few of the ways he stretched the bounds of popular music. What you have to remember is that nothing had sounded like this EVER, and he played a large role in that progression. He was someone for the band to bounce ideas off, to turn the good ideas into reality. As I write in Your Song Changed My Life, the orchestral chaos that blew my mind on ""A Day in the Life"" is based on an idea that George Martin claimed John Lennon gave him, a request he recalled in the book All The Songs: The Story Behind Every Beatles Release: ""What I'd like to hear is a tremendous buildup, from nothing up to something absolutely like the end of the world."" Martin achieved that vision by hiring an orchestra, recording it multiple times, and then layering the recordings to create the massive, overwhelming racket that lifts the song out of the ordinary and then brings it to a halt.

With The Beatles growth from a small, charming combo to this massive musical explosion, pop music became more than a song to sing along with. It became something to lose yourself in, something to commune with. I've come to expect and want that from music. Clearly, so did George Martin. These days, as I sift through thousands of songs for All Songs Considered, what I hope to find is basically the seed that he planted in my young head: that music at its best should be a sonic adventure. His contributions, along with such a talented band in such an experimental time, changed the way so many people make music, all these days later. Thank you for this gift, George Martin. Thank you.",[]

A curious crowd lingered around Amal Graafstra as he carefully unpacked a pair of gloves, a small sterile blanket and a huge needle. A long line of people were waiting to get tiny computer chips implanted into their hands.

Graafstra had set up shop in a booth in the middle of an exhibit hall at the Austin Convention Center, where he gathered last month with several hundred others who call themselves ""body hackers""  people who push the boundaries of implantable technology to improve the human body.

The movement evokes visceral reactions, brings up safety and ethical concerns and quickly veers into sci-fi questions about the line between human and cyborg.

Graafstra is a pioneer in the space. Using his own body to experiment, he designed bio-safe magnets and the microchip he was about to implant into the hand of A.J. Butt, who was sporting a tall, blue mohawk.

toggle caption Eyder Peralta/NPR

The implantable RFID chips hold encrypted information, and their unique ID numbers can be used to open doors or unlock the owner's smartphone, which is what Butt wants to do.

Butt took a deep breath. The needle plunged into his skin at the base of his thumb, and a chip bigger than a grain of rice slipped just below the surface.

Across the way, Sasha Rose, who was working a meditation booth at the convention, watched the people line up to be ""chipped.""

She shook her head: This was the craziest thing she had seen. She wondered about Graafstra's credentials. She thought this was a medical procedure, so should he be performing it? Did his clients know the potential consequences of carrying personal information on a device inside their skin?

""More than the crazy concept, it's actually people's willingness to accept it. That's why it's crazy to me,"" Rose said. ""People are just willing to just line up and go, 'Yeah, stick that in me.' ""

At night, many of the convention goers gathered at a club on Austin's 6th Street.

Graafstra was outside with Ryan O'Shea, whose company Grindhouse Wetware made the Internet squirm earlier this year when it released a close-up surgery video of one of its implants called Northstar. In it, a man gets a small incision in his hand and then, with a metallic tool dipped into it, the skin is lifted to produce a cavity where a round subdermal implant with five LED lights is placed.

The result looks dystopian  the incision is stitched with black thread, and LED lights make the skin on the hand glow red.

But body hackers view the world differently, Graafstra said. They believe technology has reached a point where it can improve the human body instead of just fixing what's broken.

toggle caption Eyder Peralta/NPR

""A patient may someday come very soon and say, 'My eye is totally fine, but I want an eye that can see infrared. And I want an eye that can zoom,' "" Graafstra said.

That kind of future  where the human body is augmented by technology  is the goal of many of these experiments.

O'Shea said Grindhouse Wetware is using its LED device to test how long a device like it can remain charged inside a body, and Graafstra said his RFID chip is a small attempt at merging digital identity with physical identity.

""I think once people realize, 'Oh, it's OK that my grandma has a pacemaker' ... people are going to start to accept this,"" O'Shea said. ""You know, the era of transhumanism, I would say, is here. So let's accept that and then see where that logically takes us.""

Inside the club, a drone hovered above the dance floor. The polished steel and the electronic dance music gave it a futuristic feel.

Standing near the bar was Tony Salvador, who studies social values and how they affect technology at Intel. He was at the conference to get a feel of when and if ""body hacking"" may be accepted into the mainstream.

If we define ourselves as organisms, suddenly our group is wider.

Sometimes, he said, technology moves too fast and outpaces accepted social boundaries  not to mention laws. He argued that was part of the reason why early wearers of Google Glass were called ""glassholes.""

""It created a social misunderstanding,"" Salvador said. ""You didn't know what was going on.""

To Salvador, the boundaries of acceptance are a matter of our social philosophy, an area that he argued was driven by esoteric discourse without tangible moral and ethical recommendations.

The philosophers, he said, are letting us down.

Alva Noe, a philosopher at the University of California, Berkeley, and contributor to NPR's 13.7: Cosmos and Culture blog, has written extensively on what he calls ""cyborgian naturalness."" He disagreed that the modern philosophers dropped the ball, saying that tackling the matter would involve unpacking two questions:

Is it OK to cut into human bodies for these kinds of experiments? How much tolerance should society have for artificially enhancing the body?

To the first question, Noe said he found the ""body hacking"" experimentation on humans ""ethically disturbing"" and couldn't fathom a doctor or any other scientists conducting these kinds of operations.

The second question was more complicated.

""We don't condemn people for using glasses to see better,"" he said. ""But we do start to think taking speed to cope with your work life is questionable.""

Because those kinds of judgments are an ethical question, drawing a tolerance line may always be a moving target, he said.

""We may reach consensuses and then lose them,"" Noe said. ""Just as there was once a consensus where it was OK to smoke to function effectively, and now we have the consensus that, increasingly, it's not OK to do that.""

If there's a rock star in the body hacking movement, that's Neil Harbisson, a colorblind artist from Barcelona, who persuaded a doctor to implant a camera in the back of his head. The antenna, as he calls it, essentially lets Harbisson listen to colors by detecting the dominant color in front of him and translating it into musical notes.

toggle caption Luis Ortiz/LatinContent/Getty Images

The way he tells it, a medical ethics committee in Europe had refused to sign off on the operation but a doctor agreed to perform the surgery anonymously. From it, Harbisson emerged with a camera connected to a device on the back of his skull, its lens dangling in front of his face on a rod that arcs over his head.

As he walked the streets of Austin, he described how he perceived the world: the red traffic light sounded like an A note, the green grass sounded like an F.

In his keynote address at the conference, Harbisson said the first time he heard those colors in his sleep, he felt truly cyborg. Now, he no longer identifies as human, but a ""cybernetic organism.""

""If we define ourselves as organisms, suddenly our group is wider,"" he said. ""We are on the same level as an insect, or as a cat, or as a plant.""

Harbisson is well aware of how the world perceives him. He moved from Barcelona to New York City in search of ""peace"" with another friend in the transhumanist movement, Moon Ribas. Ribas has an electronic device in her arm that she said vibrates when there is an earthquake anywhere in the world.

On more than one occasion, people have tried to rip off his antenna, Harbisson said. That's part of the reason why he co-founded the Cyborg Foundation to advocate for ""cyborg rights.""

When asked if he's ever thought about just taking the antenna off, Harbisson demurred.

""To me, it's much stronger, the wish to sense what's around me than the fact that people keep annoying me,"" he said, adding that maybe, in the future, as others get new senses, he'll be considered normal.",[]

China's economy isn't doing too well these days, but you wouldn't know it from the government's real estate transaction center in Shanghai's Baoshan district. Hundreds of people jam the office every day to put in paperwork for homes they've just purchased. The crowds are so loud and anxious that guards wearing white hardhats and wielding bullhorns patrol the lines to keep order.

In January, home prices in Shanghai were up by more than 15 percent from a year earlier, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. In the southern city of Shenzhen, prices have jumped by more than 50 percent in the past 12 months.

i toggle caption Frank Langfitt/NPR Frank Langfitt/NPR

""Originally, I didn't plan to buy at this particular time, but now prices have forced me to,"" says a construction worker surnamed Zhang, 50, speaking over the din of the crowd at the transaction center. ""If I don't buy now, future prices will be more unbearable.""

Sitting next to him is Anna Zhang, no relation, who feels the same way. Zhang, who is 27 and works for an export company, has just bought her first home with her husband. The apartment, which is less than 600 square feet, cost the couple more than $200,000, most of which they borrowed from a bank. That's a lot of money in a city where the average annual salary is about $14,000, according to Zhaopin.com, a job recruitment portal.

Anna Zhang says she had no intention of spending so much, but had no choice.

""I would call a homeowner in the morning and he'd offer one price,"" she says. ""When I called him back in the afternoon, there was another price. This happened twice and [the] price jumped anywhere from $7,500 to $15,000.""

Home prices are rising in top-tier cities, including Beijing and Guangzhou, at a time when China's economic growth continues to slow and currency and stock prices remain down. GDP growth was 6.9 percent last year, the lowest rate in a quarter-century. The Shanghai composite has dropped by about 45 percent since its high in June.

What gives? Oliver Rui, who teaches finance at China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, says rising home prices are not a sign of confidence in the economy  but of uncertainty. Many small and mid-size business owners are pouring money into Shanghai real estate because they see it as a safe haven for their capital.

""They think that the outlook of the economy is not clear,"" says Rui. ""They don't want to further invest in their business, so the best way to hedge against inflation is real estate.""

That's because, historically, real estate in top Chinese cities has been a sure bet. If you bought an apartment in downtown Shanghai in, say, the year 2000, you might have seen the value rise 10 times.

Rui, though, warns that continuing to pour money into China's real estate sector isn't good for the economy in the long run. It sidelines capital that could be better used to build a more nimble, innovative economic model that could create better jobs with higher wages.

While China's wealthiest cities are enjoying price runs, huge swaths of apartments in so-called second-, third- and fourth-tier cities in the country's interior are gathering dust. At the end of last year, there were about 182 square miles worth of unsold residential floor space, according to the Chinese government. That's more than the area of Philadelphia.

China's government has cut deed taxes and reduced down payment requirements to try to sell off some of this white-elephant inventory  but many Chinese have neither the cash nor the desire to buy in smaller cities.

""There's a concern that in the future, there will be fewer and fewer policy measures available to get people to buy this housing,"" said Lu Wenxi, a researcher with Centaline, a leading real estate company operating in China. ""If the market weakens further, we'll eventually use up all the tools in our toolbox.""

Officials in the northeastern rust-belt city of Shenyang recently considered offering college graduates housing loans with no down payment. In a culture known for thrift, this sort of sub-prime scheme drew howls online, and the local government put plans on hold.

""That indicates in certain areas,"" says Rui, ""the local government is desperate.""",[]

This week, several Balkan countries slammed their borders shut on migrants, effectively cutting off their main route leading to Northern Europe.

It's causing growing humanitarian concerns as tens of thousands of people who hoped to move north remain stuck in camps in Greece. Meanwhile, EU nations are still struggling to come up with a solution to the crisis.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized the current situation  exacerbated by Austria's decision to impose new border restrictions last month  as ""not durable and sustainable"" in an interview broadcast Thursday.

""This unilateral decision by Austria and subsequently by the Balkan countries on one hand brings us fewer refugees, but on the other hand puts Greece in a very difficult situation,"" Merkel said in an interview with MDR radio, the Associated Press reported.

""The problem is not solved by one (country) making a decision, it must be a decision that is right for all 28,"" she adds.

The closures are creating a bottleneck of migrants in Greece, which has been a main entry point to Europe. Reporter Joanna Kakissis told Morning Edition on Wednesday that there are ""currently more than 35,000 Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans stuck in Greece  in crowded camps mostly.""

Joanna says the Balkan countries are stopping anyone without a visa:

""They really had no choice after Austria imposed these very severe border restrictions last month. Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia  these are all parts of what used to be Yugoslavia. And they have long said they don't have the resources to care for very large groups of asylum seekers. ""Migrants were just transiting through these countries. ... So sometimes they only stayed a few hours before going on to the next border. But with northern Europe closing to migrants, Balkan countries worry that lots of Syrians and Iraqis would be stuck there, just as is happening now in Greece.""

It means the migrants stuck in Greece face tough decisions about their next steps. The Washington Post reports that some are deciding to cross through Hungary, which has earned a ""reputation as the most hostile nation in Europe"" toward migrants.

Hungary's brand-new border fence and the threat of prison sentences for people caught crossing over has pushed migrants to chose other routes. But as the Post reports:

""Now that the neighbors are all closing their own borders, however, asylum seekers are coming back to Hungary. After months in which the number of people caught trying to sneak through the fence dropped nearly to zero, arrests have risen sharply in recent weeks as controls tightened elsewhere. In February alone, nearly 2,500 people were apprehended.""

At a Brussels summit earlier this week, the EU and Turkey indicated they are nearing an agreement to address the flood of migrants, as we reported. The accord is expected to formally block the Western Balkan route, the main path migrants have been using as they head to northern Europe.

As NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson has reported, European leaders ""want Ankara to do a better job of stopping illegal migrants from transiting through Turkey to get to Europe, and to take back rejected asylum seekers that came through Turkey.""

The leaders are scheduled to reconvene on March 17 to discuss the proposal, which is coming under increasing criticism from rights advocates.

U.N. Human Rights Chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein decried the ""race to repel these people,"" which he says is ""picking up momentum,"" in a speech Thursday to the Human Rights Council. He said the draft agreement with Turkey ""raises a number of very serious concerns."" Here's more from Hussein:

""Among my concerns is the potential for collective and arbitrary expulsions, which are illegal. Border restrictions which do not permit determination of circumstance of each individual violate international and European law. ""I must also reiterate my profound concern about the restrictive measures such as erecting fences; denying people access to individualised procedures; and arbitrarily denying entry to people of specific nationalities.""

Human Rights Watch's refugee rights director, Bill Frelick, said in a statement that the emerging EU-Turkey deal has a ""fundamental contradiction"":

""The parties failed to say how individual needs for international protection would be fairly assessed during the rapid-fire mass expulsions the agreed would take place.""

Ultimately, ""refugees should not be used as bargaining chips,"" Frelick says.",[]

In 1903, in a cheery local tavern tucked away in Wells River, Vt., one of America's most successful fat men's clubs was launched.

""We're fat and we're making the most of it!"" was their mantra. ""I've got to be good-natured; I can't fight and I can't run"" was their motto. Members had to be at least 200 pounds, pay a $1 fee to enter and learn a secret handshake and password. Twice a year, members gathered, with meetings announced in advance to allow the men to stuff up in order to meet the minimum weight requirement. A 1904 Boston Globe article described the biannual meetings colorfully:

""This village is full of bulbous and overhanging abdomens and double chinstonight, for the New England Fat Men's Club is in session at Hale's Tavern. The natives, who are mostly bony and angular, have stared with envy at the portly forms and rubicund faces which have arrived on every train.""

The fat men's clubs of the late 19th and early 20th century were spectacular celebrations of the wealth and chubbiness of a bygone era. At once sociological curiosity and anthropological artifact, these clubs were a vestige of perhaps the last time society found corpulence to be worthy of celebration.

Weigh-ins were a competitive event. A New York Times article from 1885 describes the crestfallen reaction of a member of a Connecticut fat men's club upon stepping on the scale. ""I must weigh over 300 pounds now,"" George Kapp boasted. Alas: He came in at a disappointing 243. As the Times reported, ""His friends thought he shrank at least 20 pounds more from grief before evening.""

Daryl Leeworthy, a historian at the U.K.'s Swansea University, says that fat men's clubs weren't just an East Coast phenomenon: Nevada, Utah and Tennessee boasted versions as well. And he says the clubs weren't just venues to celebrate the joys of eating without concern and brag about one's girth: They were, essentially, networking events. Memphis' fat men's baseball club had a reception committee replete with judges, ministers and a rabbi, he says. Populist Democrat William Jennings Bryan traveled to a Fat Men's Club in Concord, Mass., to drum up support for one of his presidential runs, Leeworthy says.

What did one do at a fat men's club gathering? Well, eat, of course  a lot. At its peak, the New England's Fat Men's Club had 10,000 members, according to writer Polly Tafrate's brief history of the club for Upper Valley Life. The men would cram huge breakfasts into their bellies, then stumble outside and work up a sweat in a friendly Olympics-style competition showcasing strength and virility: leap-frog contests, broad jumps and races, Tafrate writes.

The exertion also served to jumpstart appetite for the indulgent dinner spread that awaited members at sundown. It was a ridiculous amount of food, Tafrate writes:

""One nine-course menu included oyster cocktail, cream of chicken soup, boiled snapper, fillet of beef with mushrooms, roast chicken, roast suckling pig, shrimp salad, steamed fruit pudding with brandy sauce, assorted cakes, cheese and ice cream followed by coffee and cigars. The evening was laced with large portions of wit, sarcasm and roaring laughter.""

Even at the height of chubby chic, being grossly, morbidly obese was never celebrated as a sign of beauty and wealth, explains Peter Stearns, a professor of history at George Mason University and author of Fat History. He notes that, while having wide hips and some girth was considered attractive for a woman  indicating her prosperity and fertility  ""fat ladies"" were often mocked and included as a freak show element in traveling circuses. Fat men weren't similarly lampooned, though they, too, faced ridicule: Tafrate's article mentions a child exclaiming, ""Gee, look at that stomach! Let's get under it and keep out of the rain!""

However, female versions of Fat Men's Clubs did exist, according to Leeworthy. He points to a Hazleton, Pa., venue whose female members weighed 236 pounds on average. But Leeworthy says the opposite fat women's reduction clubs  were far more common.

""One of these existed in Chicago just after the First World War and aimed at promoting responsible diet among the city's overweight women,"" Leeworthy told us in an email. ""Even in the 19th century, diet pills (sometimes known as 'obesity pills') were advertised. ... In a world where power and status mattered a great deal, this was yet another reminder that women tended to have neither.""

Fat men's clubs were not a uniquely American phenomenon  though they were more popular here than elsewhere, Leeworthy adds. There was a French version  Les Cents Kilos, or ""The Hundred Kilos""  formed in 1897 that didn't quite take off. The Serbian capital of Belgrade created a version in 1932. He says Britain's version of the club had a twist: Members who didn't meet the weight requirement had to pay a fine, which was donated to charity.

Throughout history, there have been wavering ideas about ideal body type. As Leeworthy notes, ""Traditionally, being fat was closely associated with wealth and status. For most of our ancestors, the poorer they were, the less food they had to eat, and the thinner and shorter they tended to be. And power and wealth and status are attractive characteristics: If a person's body is their temple, then being the size of a cathedral told others that you were someone of significance.""

But as the Industrial Revolution began to change the way we worked and ate, views about fat and health also began to shift. ""An increasing number of people had jobs that weren't physically demanding,"" Stearns notes. And the advent of modern agricultural methods made food supply more reliable. ""For the bulk of the middle class, the pendulum began to swing,"" he says. In other words, people were expending less energy and were more confident about getting a meal.

In some ways, Fat Men's clubs were a last hurrah for celebrations of corpulence. As Stearns writes in Fat History, ""In general, in a trend that began around 1910, doctors and insurance actuaries began to push preferability of underweight to overweight, in terms of health and longevity.""

Being fat was no longer so feted. Membership at fat men's clubs began to dwindle, as did waistlines. For instance, at the last meeting of the New England Fat Men's Club, in 1924, only 38 members showed up  none of whom met the 200-pound mark, Tafrate reports.

Today, body image faces a new chapter. Gone are Twiggy-inspired skinny legs; curvy, more realistic Barbies are set to hit the market to reflect actual bodies. Thigh gaps, hot dog legs, and waist trainers, while still a part of the popular lexicon, are criticized for promoting unhealthy body images.

While it's unlikely that Fat Men's Clubs will ever catch on again, current trends towards body acceptance might yet nudge us toward that Goldilocks level of body image: not too fat, not too thin, just plain healthy.

In 1903, in a cheery local tavern tucked away in Wells River, Vt., one of America's most successful fat men's clubs was launched.

""We're fat and we're making the most of it!"" was their mantra. ""I've got to be good-natured; I can't fight and I can't run"" was their motto. Members had to be at least 200 pounds, pay a $1 fee to enter and learn a secret handshake and password. Twice a year, members gathered, with meetings announced in advance to allow the men to stuff up in order to meet the minimum weight requirement. A 1904 Boston Globe article described the biannual meetings colorfully:

""This village is full of bulbous and overhanging abdomens and double chinstonight, for the New England Fat Men's Club is in session at Hale's Tavern. The natives, who are mostly bony and angular, have stared with envy at the portly forms and rubicund faces which have arrived on every train.""

i toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Canada and the U.S. have announced a cooperative plan to tackle climate change by cutting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, investing in clean energy research and reducing future hydrofluorocarbon use.

At a joint press conference in the White House Rose Garden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Obama praised the strong ties between Canada and the U.S. They also announced plans to further facilitate trade between the two countries and expressed a shared commitment to protect the environment.

""As the first U.S. president to visit the Arctic, I saw how both of our nations are threatened by rising seas, melting permafrost, disappearing glaciers and sea ice,"" Obama said.

""The president and I share a common goal: We want a clean-growth economy that continues to provide good jobs and great opportunities for all of our citizens,"" Trudeau said. ""And I'm confident that by working together, we'll get there sooner than we think.""

Trudeau's visit to the White House is the first by a sitting Canadian prime minister in nearly two decades. And the collaborative approach to regulating the oil and gas industry comes after years of tension between the Obama and Canadian leaders over the White House's opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline.

Trudeau, who assumed his post in November, is just starting his time as the leader of Canada; Obama, for his part, is in his final year in office. But Obama told reporters he's confident that their agreement will survive the next administration.

The two leaders have committed to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent, relative to 2012 levels, by 2025, and to join a World Bank campaign to reduce routine flaring at gas and oil operations.

Their joint statement on climate change efforts included a number of other shared commitments, including:

Ratifying the Paris Agreement as soon as possible

Implementing aligned emission standards for tractor-trailers and buses (in addition to existing standards for cars and light trucks)

Phasing down use of hydrofluorocarbons, an alternative to CFCs that don't damage the ozone layer but do contribute to climate change.

Making it easier for renewable energy to be integrated into existing power grids in the two nations

Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies

Improving the efficiency of appliances and equipment

The Keystone XL pipeline  which strained ties between the U.S. and Canada over the past few years, and dominated discussions of energy between the two nations  was not mentioned.

The two leaders also expressed a desire to collaborate to protect the Arctic beyond reducing the impact of climate change. They set a goal of protecting 17 percent of Arctic land and 10 percent of marine areas, and said they were committed to involving indigenous leaders, as well as traditional knowledge, in decisions related to the Arctic.

The shared commitment to fighting climate change, in particular, was received as a significant shift in both nations' positions.

Last year, NPR's Christopher Joyce wrote that when it came to international cooperation on climate change, ""the U.S. government has been like the big-ticket movie star who has been offered the lead role, but won't commit.""

And Canada? In The New Republic last fall, Rebecca Leber called Canada under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper a ""climate villain.""

With Thursday's joint statement, Obama and Trudeau indicated they now want their countries to step to the forefront of the global conversation on climate change.

""We know that our international partners expect  and indeed need  leadership from us on this issue,"" Trudeau said.",[]

i toggle caption Ray Mickshaw/FX Ray Mickshaw/FX

In 1995, the televised trial of O.J. Simpson riveted the nation. Lead prosecutor Marcia Clark made the case against the hall-of-fame football player, who was accused of the brutal double homicide of his ex-wife and her friend.

Throughout the trial, Clark faced tremendous scrutiny. She was criticized for courtroom decisions as well as for her hairstyle, clothing and her personal life. Many ultimately blamed her for Simpson's acquittal.

The feeling at the time was that ""Marcia Clark is a strident shrew bitch-person,"" actress Sarah Paulson tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross. Paulson portrays Clark in FX's The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story. While preparing for the role, she watched video footage of Clark during the Simpson trial and read her memoir. Later, she also met Clark in person.

""My impressions of her now, after portraying her, are incredibly, vastly different,"" Paulson says. ""I now hold her to be a very competent, complicated, strong, deep-thinking, quick-witted, quick-draw, wonderful creature.""

The People v. O.J. Simpson is co-produced Ryan Murphy, who also co-created the FX anthology series American Horror Story, which Paulson has appeared in for all five of its seasons.

Though the O.J. series has been gaining a lot of attention, Paulson says she's waiting until some of the buzz dies down before watching. ""I think it's the first time in my professional life I have felt a real swell of positive feeling about my work in something,"" she says. ""I'm trying to just enjoy that, because I know that if I watch it I'm going to start picking it apart, and I think it would be a nice treat for myself to give myself a minute of enjoyment to celebrate the work.""

Interview Highlights

On how much the truth matters when portraying real events in a television show

I think it's of paramount importance, and at the same time it is a television show and it is a dramatization. There is no way to know exactly what Marcia Clark was feeling ... and how she cries privately, and there are many, many things that cannot be known. ... I just sort of have to kind of get behind knowing that the bulk of it is all true, and the moments that cannot be known  except for by the people that were actually there and lived it  that's where the acting comes in and the clever writing, at least you hope. I think the whole thing in general  everything was incredibly well-vetted and all of that.

On how she prepared to play Clark

I read, watched and listened to any and everything I could get my hands on. The good news is there are copious amounts of videos on the Internet where I was able to watch a lot of her physical [mannerisms]  her carriage, the way she used her hands, the way she spoke, how she often tilted her head to one side, particularly in the courtroom when she was addressing the judge, the defense team or the jury. I read her book, I read [Christopher] Darden's book [In Contempt], I read [Jeffrey] Toobin's book [The Run of His Life], and of course I read our scripts, which was probably where I ended up holding most closely that stuff. ...

The more I read about her, the more I knew about her, the more I just wanted to get it right. That was my primary concern, was just to get it right  and by right I mean just for it to be authentic and truthful. I wasn't really looking at it as a way of trying to correct any perceptions or misconceptions about Marcia, I just wanted to try to do it in an honorable and a truthful way.

On why she wanted to meet Clark in person

I don't even know that I wanted to know anything specific, I just wanted to breathe the same air that she was breathing, in the same moment. I had so immersed myself in all things Marcia Rachel Clark that the idea that I could be sitting across from her ... I just kind of wanted to hug her. I wanted to look her in the eye and tell her that she didn't have to be fearful of the take that was going to be presented about her, given all that I knew she had endured.

I could've only imagined and anticipated that she was going to be terribly, terribly anxious about having to relive this experience that was a great trauma for her. She never went back into the courtroom to prosecute a case after this trial and she had won 19 out of 20 prior to this case, so it was obviously a great passion of hers and it was stolen from her. I don't know that I took anything away from it or expected anything other than I just wanted to be in her orbit.

On the scrutiny she has encountered over her appearance, which helped her relate to the scrutiny Clark faced during the trial

I have naturally brown hair and every time I've been asked to be a leading lady on television or in a movie I have often been asked to make my hair blonde. And that is a sort of a weird slippery slope where you start to go, ""Gosh ... if my job on this particular program is supposed to be alluring or charming, thought of as a sexual creature, I have to have blonde hair? What does it mean that I don't actually have blonde hair? Does it mean that I am not any of those things without it?""

On playing conjoined twins on American Horror Story

Essentially, it was all done on a green screen and I would come in in the morning and prerecord my dialogue, because often the twins were speaking telepathically to one another and I wanted to be able to hear my own voice in my head. So I would record it and then wear an earwig so that I could talk to myself. I didn't want to have another actress off camera reading that didn't sound like me and didn't sound like my twin.

i toggle caption FX FX

It was a lot of lonely work, where I would have to look at a piece of tape and imagine my own head there. I never was able to look in anyone else's eyes to play a scene with myself. ... It was incredibly challenging and very, very technical. And everyone who ever did a scene with me on that season of Horror Story was always bemoaning the fact that they had to work with me because it meant their day was infinitely longer because it was just take after take, and we essentially had to do everything twice.

On making news after she kissed then-girlfriend Cherry Jones at the 2005 Tony Awards

I think I was a bit naive, actually, as to what it would mean. I was just doing what was instinctual to me, which was to congratulate and kiss the person whom I loved and who had just won a very fancy acting prize. It would've been strange for me to what, I don't know, pat her on the head, pat her on the shoulder, and I just did what it occurred to me to do. But I was very quickly made aware of it being a bit of a news [story] because I got a phone call from my publicist saying, ""Why did you do that?"" She's no longer my publicist, by the way. ...

I remember feeling like I was getting my hand slapped, that I had done something wrong, and I didn't feel very comfortable with that.

On whether she worries that being, as she puts it, sexually ""fluid"" affects the kinds of roles she gets

I wonder sometimes if being in the Ryan Murphy world  in that I get to play so many different types of characters within that one TV show  that there really isn't time to sort of typecast me as one particular kind of thing. I'm not a sex symbol, I'm not ... your typical movie star. And so I wonder if I've been sort of protected from having to worry about it preventing me from working in a way, because the public doesn't really have a particular attachment to me being one type of thing.

On whether society has become more accepting of fluid sexual orientation

The politicization of it is complicated for me, because I only know what to do according to what I feel and I only want to be governed by that. I try not to make any choices across the board that are dictated to me by someone else's idea of what [my sexuality] should be. So I do hope that the idea of somebody being fluid is no longer a covert or a euphemism for ""Oh, gay, just don't want to say it."" Because for me, I have been with men and I have been with women, and I don't know what lies ahead, and I don't want to be stuck with some kind of label that then makes me then a traitor to my people if I make a different choice. I want the freedom  my own personal freedom  to decide that as I see fit.

On her current relationship with actress Holland Taylor, who is about 30 years older

There is a very significant age difference. And when you love a person, the idea of losing them is terrifying, to put it mildly. So I have thought about it. But Holland actually put the best spin on it and said what I think was a very funny thing. ... We were at a dinner party and we were newly out and about as a couple, and a mutual friend of ours said, ""Oh, Holland, I'm so pleased for you. I'm so happy, this is so great, you and Sarah."" And Holland said, ""Yeah, I know. Look, if she dies, she dies."" It was so disarming. And Holland's point being: Yes, on paper, it looks like one thing, but anything can happen and you just don't know.",[]
npr.org,2016-03-10 00:00:00,How Best To Test For Zika Virus? : Shots,[],"How Best To Test For Zika Virus?

i toggle caption Arnulfo Franco/AP Arnulfo Franco/AP

Let's say you're a pregnant woman who recently traveled to Latin America or the Caribbean. You got a little sick shortly after the trip, with some combination of mild fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis. The big question now is: Did you have Zika virus? And, if so, is your fetus still healthy?

""Probably every day, patients come in questioning whether or not they would qualify for testing,"" says Dr. Christine Curry, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Miami, and Jackson Memorial Hospital.

A preliminary study in Brazil makes a strong case for the link between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and a number of birth defects, including microcephaly. The infection has been associated with a range of outcomes in another study of nine U.S. women who caught the virus while traveling to regions where Zika is prevalent.

If a patient has a particular travel history, Curry sends a sample of the woman's blood to a lab for analysis. But it can take awhile for test results to come back, Curry says, and the waiting can be really stressful, especially for patients in the middle of a pregnancy.

""They're trying to decide what to do with the pregnancy, given so many unknowns,"" she says. ""The difference between two and four weeks can be the difference between being able to end a pregnancy and not.""

There's another problem: Some tests aren't very reliable, so patients sometimes have to go through multiple rounds to confirm whether they had Zika. That puts Curry in a tricky situation when she's counseling patients.

""It involves saying 'I don't know' and 'no one knows' over and over again,"" she says.

Until recently, most samples of fluids from patients had to be sent to Atlanta for testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now, about 30 local public health labs are gearing up to do the analysis themselves, including the District of Columbia's department of forensic sciences, where Cleveland Weeden works as a medical technologist.

Most days, Weeden says, he feels like an athlete stuck on the bench. Outbreaks are exciting, in a way, because he finally gets to put his expertise and skills to work.

""We're the bench,"" Weeden says. ""We get called into action when something goes on in the city.""

A refrigerator behind Weeden holds plastic baggies with tubes of blood and urine from patients in the area. As of this week, his job is to test all these samples for Zika virus.

Weeden expects to get the results to patients within three days, rather than four weeks. He's running a procedure called RT-PCR  or Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction. The CDC has produced about 375,000 kits that can perform this test. It looks for pieces of the virus' genetic material and answers ""yes"" or ""no"" to the question: ""Is there virus in this person's blood?""

Weeden says the test is pretty straightforward  except for one thing.

""From the time the person is bitten [by an infected mosquito] to the time they get to the doctor, no more than five to seven days can pass for us to [be able to] pick it up on PCR,"" he says.

That means that if PCR is to work, doctors have to collect patients' blood within a week of the first signs of a fever and rash. The virus hangs around a little longer in urine, so doctors would have a slightly longer window of time  about two weeks  to collect those samples. But there's an extra complication, Curry says: Most patients don't rush to the doctor when their illness is mild.

""If someone had virus in their blood three weeks ago and they're now cleared, the PCR's not going to tell you that,"" she says. In that case, a negative result could mean either that the person never had Zika, or that their body had already cleared it from their system by the time they got tested.

That's why labs like Weeden's are trying to get hold of another kind of test that the CDC developed, which goes by yet another bulky acronym  the Zika MAC-ELISA. This test looks for a protein in a person's blood  a specific type of antibody  that shows what foreign things the body has fought off recently.

The Zika MAC-ELISA is widely seen as the best test available, right now, because it works over a longer time span than the first option. It's also faster and cheaper than another more definitive test, and requires less specialized training to perform. According to the CDC, Zika antibodies appear in the blood ""starting 4 to 5 days after the start of illness and last for up to 12 weeks,"" or even longer in some people.

The CDC has produced about 100,000 of these test kits, and is offering them free to qualified labs. But there's one drawback: The test sometimes tells people they had Zika when they didn't.

An ideal test, all agree, would be specific to this particular virus and give a faster turnaround time  eliminating the need for the manpower, money and time required to go through the current layers of testing.

It's not just pregnant women who would benefit from a better test  so would patients who need blood transfusions in places like Puerto Rico, where health officials have been worried that patients might accidentally get Zika during transfusions with infected blood. So the officials have stopped accepting local donations and, instead, are now getting blood shipped in from the continental U.S.

The third, more definitive, test is called PRNT, or the plaque-reduction neutralization test. Because PRNT is expensive and takes at least a week longer to do than the Zika MAC-ELISA, the ELISA test is widely considered the more practical option in many cases.

""And herein lies where science needs to innovate a bit,"" says Ted Pierson, a virologist and senior investigator at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Sometime in December, Pierson and colleagues in his molecular virology lab dropped their work on dengue virus so they could press the pedal to the metal on Zika. Pierson's work doesn't focus on pregnant women or blood transfusions.

""I am focused on amino acids, hydroxyls and phosphates,"" he explains. His team is trying to figure out how to make a better version of the antibody test  the Zika MAC-ELISA test the CDC is distributing to labs.

""The problem here is actually quite simple,"" Pierson explains. Viruses in the same family  in Zika's case, the flaviviruses  can look similar on the outside, and the antibodies the human immune system uses to fight them can also be similar.

So, if a person had been infected sometime along the way with another mosquito-borne virus in that family, like dengue or West Nile  or even if they simply had been vaccinated against yellow fever  they could test positive in a Zika antibody test.

""It's a good example of where the devil is in the details,"" Pierson says, and those details are what he and his colleagues are delving into now.

""What we, as a field, need to do is develop antigens that allow us to distinguish between the antibodies specific to Zika, versus those for other flaviviruses,"" he says.

The group is essentially stripping down the virus to figure out what is unique to Zika  what distinguishes it from related viruses. The researchers are particularly interested in proteins, like the ""fusion loop,"" that lie on top of the virus and help it enter a human cell. Once those unique parts are identified, it might be possible to create a more specific test that has much lower odds of triggering false positives.

That could take days to figure out  or months, Pierson says.

By the time they're in elementary school, some kids prove to be more troublesome than others. They can't sit still or they're not socializing or they can't focus enough to complete tasks that the other kids are handling well. Sounds like ADHD. But it might be that they're just a little young for their grade.

Studies done in several countries including Iceland, Canada, Israel, Sweden and Taiwan show children who are at the young end of their grade cohort are more likely to get an ADHD diagnosis than their older classmates.

The youngest students were between 20 percent and 100 percent more likely to get the diagnosis or ADHD medication than were the oldest students in the cohort, says Helga Zoega, an epidemiologist at the University of Iceland who worked on the Icelandic and Israeli studies.

The most recent evidence comes from Taiwan, where an analysis showed the youngest students in a grade were roughly 75 percent more likely to get a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder than the oldest ones. It was published Thursday in the Journal of Pediatrics.

Kids are generally 6 years old when they start first grade. A scant few months can span a lot of mental growth at this age.

""Within that age range there is a huge difference in developmental and social and emotional maturity,"" says Dr. Adiaha Spinks-Franklin, a developmental and behavioral pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital who was not involved in any of the studies. ""A 6-year-old is just not the same as a 7-year-old.""

And yet a first grader might stand shoulder to shoulder with another student nearly 12 months her elder. ""And the way we diagnose ADHD is we talk to the parent about the child's behavior, and we mail the teacher questionnaires,"" Spinks-Franklin says. ""The teacher will be comparing the child's behavior relative to other children in the class.""

That could lead to a mistaken diagnosis of ADHD. Zoega says the younger the student, the greater the likelihood that student will receive an ADHD diagnosis or medication. ""If you look at the [students' age] just month by month, you'll see that the likelihood increases with each month,"" she says.

Zoega says the only country studied so far where the relative age of young children doesn't seem to have an effect on ADHD diagnosis is Denmark, where there's more flexibility for when children enter school. So this could be because Danish parents with kids who are born just before the cutoff date for grade school entry choose to hold their offspring back one year.

But if you're an American parent with children born in the months of December, November or October, that doesn't mean a child should repeat a grade for the fear their relative youth will handicap them, Spinks-Franklin says. ""There is absolutely no data to support grade repetition for maturity issues. Children who repeat a grade are at a higher risk of dropping out of high school. They are more likely to be bullied."" If the child does have ADHD or another disorder, she notes, repeating a grade will not fix the disorder.

And relatively younger children diagnosed with ADHD might really have ADHD, says Dr. Mu-Hong Chen, a psychiatrist at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. ""There's a potential for the harm of overdiagnosis and overprescription."" That would unnecessarily subject kids to unwanted side effects of stimulant medication and the stigma of the disorder. But perhaps older, more mature-looking students are just being underdiagnosed and not get help they might need, he says. The studies didn't look into that.

The best thing for worried parents to do is just give the kids a chance to grow up, Chen says. In most of the studies done on relative age and ADHD, the difference in diagnosis rates vanished by the time the students reached their teenage years. ""I think we have to wait for a while, he says. ""We have to have more time to evaluate their behavior, attention and brain development.""

The data also mean that doctors should take the child's relative age into account when diagnosing ADHD, Zoega says. ""It has a sensible solution. Just treat the individual according to his or her age.""",[]

i toggle caption Courtesy of SyFy Courtesy of SyFy

The smoke has now cleared on the first season of SyFy's ambitious adaptation of The Expanse books.

Just before the series aired, I wrote a post pleading to the gods of science fiction to please, please, please not let television destroy this thing of beauty I love so dearly. With the final credits rolled up, it's time to answer that all-important question.

Did it suck?

The answer, as we will see, tells us not just about the success or failure of a particular show but also about the nature of fandom in a world awash in stories.

So, let's start with the answer to the suck question. I am happy, so happy, to report that SyFy's The Expanse did not suck. In fact, it did not suck so much that it was the best and most important piece of science fiction to appear on the small screen in a decade.

To unpack the assessment, let's start with a little background. The Expanse is not your ordinary sci-fi story. There are no warp drives and no aliens with prosthetic forehead appendages. Set in our own solar system a few hundred years in the future, the narrative stays true to what technology might allow as humanity becomes an interplanetary culture. The realism of a day-to-day world where whole populations make their homes on other solar system worlds is what sets the first books in the series apart.

Remarkably, the show delivered on the promise of that realism. What makes the The Expanse so exciting is how hard the creative team worked to bring the science's lived-reality to bear in a way that has not been seen since 2001 A Space Odyssey.

Much of the action, for example, takes place inside the asteroid Ceres, which has been hollowed out and spun-up to create a version of artificial gravity. But while spinning something allows you create a gravity-like pull (a push really), it also leaves you dealing with the Coriolis force that bends the path of falling objects (it's the same ""force"" that bends hurricanes into their giant swirls). So, in the show we see characters pouring a drink while holding a glass off to the side as the stream corkscrews downward.

Another example of lived scientific realism comes in the many spaceship scenes. When the engines are on and you're accelerating between planets, your feet are pinned to the floor. Thrust equals gravity as Einstein showed us. But once you cut the engines, you're back in free-fall and everything goes weightless. This leads to one particularly gruesome scene with a basketball-sized floating orb of blood that I won't go into more detail about. Bleech!

Now you might think I'm just being a nerdy physicist with all this, ""Oh my God, they got the Coriolis force right!"" Well, yes, I'm afraid that's true. I was, in fact, jumping up and down on my couch during that scene.

But while I might have gotten more excited about these kinds of things than your average viewer  and I did calculate the spin rate required to give Ceres 1/3 Earth gravity  there is a deeper point. It's exactly this attention to detail that made the difference for the show's world building. Without it, the internal logic of a universe where Earth and Mars are superpowers standing at the edge of war would fall apart. And without giving us a vision for the realities of a life in space, the impoverished third-world status of societies living in the asteroid belt would have become a cartoon rather than an extension of realities we know today.

So, my verdict is that the show nailed the externalities as much as the constraints of budgets and filming on Earth allowed. But that's really just half the battle. Without characters you really love or hate, getting the physics right (or right-ish) would mean nothing more than expensive sets and a lot of CGI. It was the characters that made the difference between the books and the show really interesting.

The first book of the series is really two stories that slowly converge. On the one hand, we have Josephus Miller, a hard-nosed detective on Ceres chasing down a missing persons case that smells wrong. The noir elements of Miller's ambiguous morality are one of the books' great delights and the actor Thomas Jane perfectly captures the dark, exhausted spirit of the character. From the wise cracks to owning ""that ridiculous hat,"" Jane understood exactly how to update Sam Spade to the asteroid belt.

The second narrative involved the crew of the stolen (""salvaged"") Martian war ship the Rocinate: Capt. James Holden (Steven Strait), engineer Naomi Nagata (Dominique Tipper), pilot Alex Kumar (Can Anvar) and general badass Amos Burton (Wes Chatham). In the book, these characters know each other well and already have a bond when the story starts. The show changes these relationships allowing the viewer to become familiar with them as they slowly discover and slowly learn to trust each other. The actors did an exceptional job breathing life and humanity to their characters.

Finally there's UN diplomat/security chief Chrisjen Avasarala who does not appear in the books until the second volume. The show brings her front center  and actor Shohreh Aghdashloo mixes elegance with a viper's acumen for attack and parry in her portrayal of the spy master. The only complaint one might raise is that in the book Avasarala has a potty mouth that could singe steel. Given its PG-13 approach, the show unfortunately drops her delightful profanity.

And it's here that things get interesting in a more general sense. I fell in love with the show's complex characters and their gradually converging story lines. But they were not the same as the books' characters and their narratives were not the same as the books' stories. They were close, but different. In that way, watching The Expanse was like discovering my favorite story set in a slightly parallel universe. Things were both same and different and that, for me, said a whole lot about the role our cherished stories play in modern life.

From Sherlock Holmes to Jane Austin to Batman, culture in the era of mass media has meant the evolution of a kind of ""fandom"" which seems like something fundamentally new. Human beings are storytellers. From early myths to Shakespeare, this is how we understand ourselves. But since the beginning of the 20th century, we have developed ever more layered ways to tell our stories.

Sherlock Holmes appears in books and then on stage and then in movies and then on TV and then back again to new books. We love his character so much that we seem to need to keep telling those stories. This includes finding new ways to tell them, adapting and altering and adding-on in the process. For some, these changes and additions can be a violation of the original's ""canon"" (a term of particular nerdiness). But, if done well, they allow us to revisit the stories and delight in them again, finding new and creative directions that ultimately show us why we loved the original so deeply.

So in that way and many more, SyFy's The Expanse succeeded where it could easily have failed. To the entire creative team, I bow deeply and say, simply, ""thank you.""

i toggle caption General Photographic Agency/Getty Images General Photographic Agency/Getty Images

In 1903, in a cheery local tavern tucked away in Wells River, Vt., one of America's most successful fat men's clubs was launched.

""We're fat and we're making the most of it!"" was their mantra. ""I've got to be good-natured; I can't fight and I can't run"" was their motto. Members had to be at least 200 pounds, pay a $1 fee to enter and learn a secret handshake and password. Twice a year, members gathered, with meetings announced in advance to allow the men to stuff up in order to meet the minimum weight requirement. A 1904 Boston Globe article described the biannual meetings colorfully:

""This village is full of bulbous and overhanging abdomens and double chinstonight, for the New England Fat Men's Club is in session at Hale's Tavern. The natives, who are mostly bony and angular, have stared with envy at the portly forms and rubicund faces which have arrived on every train.""

The fat men's clubs of the late 19th and early 20th century were spectacular celebrations of the wealth and chubbiness of a bygone era. At once sociological curiosity and anthropological artifact, these clubs were a vestige of perhaps the last time society found corpulence to be worthy of celebration.

Weigh-ins were a competitive event. A New York Times article from 1885 describes the crestfallen reaction of a member of a Connecticut fat men's club upon stepping on the scale. ""I must weigh over 300 pounds now,"" George Kapp boasted. Alas: He came in at a disappointing 243. As the Times reported, ""His friends thought he shrank at least 20 pounds more from grief before evening.""

Daryl Leeworthy, a historian at the U.K.'s Swansea University, says that fat men's clubs weren't just an East Coast phenomenon: Nevada, Utah and Tennessee boasted versions as well. And he says the clubs weren't just venues to celebrate the joys of eating without concern and brag about one's girth: They were, essentially, networking events. Memphis' fat men's baseball club had a reception committee replete with judges, ministers and a rabbi, he says. Populist Democrat William Jennings Bryan traveled to a Fat Men's Club in Concord, Mass., to drum up support for one of his presidential runs, Leeworthy says.

What did one do at a fat men's club gathering? Well, eat, of course  a lot. At its peak, the New England's Fat Men's Club had 10,000 members, according to writer Polly Tafrate's brief history of the club for Upper Valley Life. The men would cram huge breakfasts into their bellies, then stumble outside and work up a sweat in a friendly Olympics-style competition showcasing strength and virility: leap-frog contests, broad jumps and races, Tafrate writes.

The exertion also served to jumpstart appetite for the indulgent dinner spread that awaited members at sundown. It was a ridiculous amount of food, Tafrate writes:

""One nine-course menu included oyster cocktail, cream of chicken soup, boiled snapper, fillet of beef with mushrooms, roast chicken, roast suckling pig, shrimp salad, steamed fruit pudding with brandy sauce, assorted cakes, cheese and ice cream followed by coffee and cigars. The evening was laced with large portions of wit, sarcasm and roaring laughter.""

Even at the height of chubby chic, being grossly, morbidly obese was never celebrated as a sign of beauty and wealth, explains Peter Stearns, a professor of history at George Mason University and author of Fat History. He notes that, while having wide hips and some girth was considered attractive for a woman  indicating her prosperity and fertility  ""fat ladies"" were often mocked and included as a freak show element in traveling circuses. Fat men weren't similarly lampooned, though they, too, faced ridicule: Tafrate's article mentions a child exclaiming, ""Gee, look at that stomach! Let's get under it and keep out of the rain!""

However, female versions of Fat Men's Clubs did exist, according to Leeworthy. He points to a Hazleton, Pa., venue whose female members weighed 236 pounds on average. But Leeworthy says the opposite fat women's reduction clubs  were far more common.

""One of these existed in Chicago just after the First World War and aimed at promoting responsible diet among the city's overweight women,"" Leeworthy told us in an email. ""Even in the 19th century, diet pills (sometimes known as 'obesity pills') were advertised. ... In a world where power and status mattered a great deal, this was yet another reminder that women tended to have neither.""

Fat men's clubs were not a uniquely American phenomenon  though they were more popular here than elsewhere, Leeworthy adds. There was a French version  Les Cents Kilos, or ""The Hundred Kilos""  formed in 1897 that didn't quite take off. The Serbian capital of Belgrade created a version in 1932. He says Britain's version of the club had a twist: Members who didn't meet the weight requirement had to pay a fine, which was donated to charity.

Throughout history, there have been wavering ideas about ideal body type. As Leeworthy notes, ""Traditionally, being fat was closely associated with wealth and status. For most of our ancestors, the poorer they were, the less food they had to eat, and the thinner and shorter they tended to be. And power and wealth and status are attractive characteristics: If a person's body is their temple, then being the size of a cathedral told others that you were someone of significance.""

But as the Industrial Revolution began to change the way we worked and ate, views about fat and health also began to shift. ""An increasing number of people had jobs that weren't physically demanding,"" Stearns notes. And the advent of modern agricultural methods made food supply more reliable. ""For the bulk of the middle class, the pendulum began to swing,"" he says. In other words, people were expending less energy and were more confident about getting a meal.

In some ways, Fat Men's clubs were a last hurrah for celebrations of corpulence. As Stearns writes in Fat History, ""In general, in a trend that began around 1910, doctors and insurance actuaries began to push preferability of underweight to overweight, in terms of health and longevity.""

Being fat was no longer so feted. Membership at fat men's clubs began to dwindle, as did waistlines. For instance, at the last meeting of the New England Fat Men's Club, in 1924, only 38 members showed up  none of whom met the 200-pound mark, Tafrate reports.

Today, body image faces a new chapter. Gone are Twiggy-inspired skinny legs; curvy, more realistic Barbies are set to hit the market to reflect actual bodies. Thigh gaps, hot dog legs, and waist trainers, while still a part of the popular lexicon, are criticized for promoting unhealthy body images.

While it's unlikely that Fat Men's Clubs will ever catch on again, current trends towards body acceptance might yet nudge us toward that Goldilocks level of body image: not too fat, not too thin, just plain healthy.

In 1995, the televised trial of O.J. Simpson riveted the nation. Lead prosecutor Marcia Clark made the case against the hall-of-fame football player, who was accused of the brutal double homicide of his ex-wife and her friend.

Throughout the trial, Clark faced tremendous scrutiny. She was criticized for courtroom decisions as well as for her hairstyle, clothing and her personal life. Many ultimately blamed her for Simpson's acquittal.

The feeling at the time was that ""Marcia Clark is a strident shrew bitch-person,"" actress Sarah Paulson tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross. Paulson portrays Clark in FX's The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story. While preparing for the role, she watched video footage of Clark during the Simpson trial and read her memoir. Later, she also met Clark in person.

""My impressions of her now, after portraying her, are incredibly, vastly different,"" Paulson says. ""I now hold her to be a very competent, complicated, strong, deep-thinking, quick-witted, quick-draw, wonderful creature.""

The People v. O.J. Simpson is co-produced Ryan Murphy, who also co-created the FX anthology series American Horror Story, which Paulson has appeared in for all five of its seasons.

Though the O.J. series has been gaining a lot of attention, Paulson says she's waiting until some of the buzz dies down before watching. ""I think it's the first time in my professional life I have felt a real swell of positive feeling about my work in something,"" she says. ""I'm trying to just enjoy that, because I know that if I watch it I'm going to start picking it apart, and I think it would be a nice treat for myself to give myself a minute of enjoyment to celebrate the work.""

Interview Highlights

On how much the truth matters when portraying real events in a television show

I think it's of paramount importance, and at the same time it is a television show and it is a dramatization. There is no way to know exactly what Marcia Clark was feeling ... and how she cries privately, and there are many, many things that cannot be known. ... I just sort of have to kind of get behind knowing that the bulk of it is all true, and the moments that cannot be known  except for by the people that were actually there and lived it  that's where the acting comes in and the clever writing, at least you hope. I think the whole thing in general  everything was incredibly well-vetted and all of that.

On how she prepared to play Clark

I read, watched and listened to any and everything I could get my hands on. The good news is there are copious amounts of videos on the Internet where I was able to watch a lot of her physical [mannerisms]  her carriage, the way she used her hands, the way she spoke, how she often tilted her head to one side, particularly in the courtroom when she was addressing the judge, the defense team or the jury. I read her book, I read [Christopher] Darden's book [In Contempt], I read [Jeffrey] Toobin's book [The Run of His Life], and of course I read our scripts, which was probably where I ended up holding most closely that stuff. ...

The more I read about her, the more I knew about her, the more I just wanted to get it right. That was my primary concern, was just to get it right  and by right I mean just for it to be authentic and truthful. I wasn't really looking at it as a way of trying to correct any perceptions or misconceptions about Marcia, I just wanted to try to do it in an honorable and a truthful way.

On why she wanted to meet Clark in person

I don't even know that I wanted to know anything specific, I just wanted to breathe the same air that she was breathing, in the same moment. I had so immersed myself in all things Marcia Rachel Clark that the idea that I could be sitting across from her ... I just kind of wanted to hug her. I wanted to look her in the eye and tell her that she didn't have to be fearful of the take that was going to be presented about her, given all that I knew she had endured.

I could've only imagined and anticipated that she was going to be terribly, terribly anxious about having to relive this experience that was a great trauma for her. She never went back into the courtroom to prosecute a case after this trial and she had won 19 out of 20 prior to this case, so it was obviously a great passion of hers and it was stolen from her. I don't know that I took anything away from it or expected anything other than I just wanted to be in her orbit.

On the scrutiny she has encountered over her appearance, which helped her relate to the scrutiny Clark faced during the trial

I have naturally brown hair and every time I've been asked to be a leading lady on television or in a movie I have often been asked to make my hair blonde. And that is a sort of a weird slippery slope where you start to go, ""Gosh ... if my job on this particular program is supposed to be alluring or charming, thought of as a sexual creature, I have to have blonde hair? What does it mean that I don't actually have blonde hair? Does it mean that I am not any of those things without it?""

On playing conjoined twins on American Horror Story

Essentially, it was all done on a green screen and I would come in in the morning and prerecord my dialogue, because often the twins were speaking telepathically to one another and I wanted to be able to hear my own voice in my head. So I would record it and then wear an earwig so that I could talk to myself. I didn't want to have another actress off camera reading that didn't sound like me and didn't sound like my twin.

i toggle caption FX FX

It was a lot of lonely work, where I would have to look at a piece of tape and imagine my own head there. I never was able to look in anyone else's eyes to play a scene with myself. ... It was incredibly challenging and very, very technical. And everyone who ever did a scene with me on that season of Horror Story was always bemoaning the fact that they had to work with me because it meant their day was infinitely longer because it was just take after take, and we essentially had to do everything twice.

On making news after she kissed then-girlfriend Cherry Jones at the 2005 Tony Awards

I think I was a bit naive, actually, as to what it would mean. I was just doing what was instinctual to me, which was to congratulate and kiss the person whom I loved and who had just won a very fancy acting prize. It would've been strange for me to what, I don't know, pat her on the head, pat her on the shoulder, and I just did what it occurred to me to do. But I was very quickly made aware of it being a bit of a news [story] because I got a phone call from my publicist saying, ""Why did you do that?"" She's no longer my publicist, by the way. ...

I remember feeling like I was getting my hand slapped, that I had done something wrong, and I didn't feel very comfortable with that.

On whether she worries that being, as she puts it, sexually ""fluid"" affects the kinds of roles she gets

I wonder sometimes if being in the Ryan Murphy world  in that I get to play so many different types of characters within that one TV show  that there really isn't time to sort of typecast me as one particular kind of thing. I'm not a sex symbol, I'm not ... your typical movie star. And so I wonder if I've been sort of protected from having to worry about it preventing me from working in a way, because the public doesn't really have a particular attachment to me being one type of thing.

On whether society has become more accepting of fluid sexual orientation

The politicization of it is complicated for me, because I only know what to do according to what I feel and I only want to be governed by that. I try not to make any choices across the board that are dictated to me by someone else's idea of what [my sexuality] should be. So I do hope that the idea of somebody being fluid is no longer a covert or a euphemism for ""Oh, gay, just don't want to say it."" Because for me, I have been with men and I have been with women, and I don't know what lies ahead, and I don't want to be stuck with some kind of label that then makes me then a traitor to my people if I make a different choice. I want the freedom  my own personal freedom  to decide that as I see fit.

On her current relationship with actress Holland Taylor, who is about 30 years older

There is a very significant age difference. And when you love a person, the idea of losing them is terrifying, to put it mildly. So I have thought about it. But Holland actually put the best spin on it and said what I think was a very funny thing. ... We were at a dinner party and we were newly out and about as a couple, and a mutual friend of ours said, ""Oh, Holland, I'm so pleased for you. I'm so happy, this is so great, you and Sarah."" And Holland said, ""Yeah, I know. Look, if she dies, she dies."" It was so disarming. And Holland's point being: Yes, on paper, it looks like one thing, but anything can happen and you just don't know.",[]
npr.org,2016-03-10 00:00:00,How Best To Test For Zika Virus? : Shots,[],"How Best To Test For Zika Virus?

i toggle caption Arnulfo Franco/AP Arnulfo Franco/AP

Let's say you're a pregnant woman who recently traveled to Latin America or the Caribbean. You got a little sick shortly after the trip, with some combination of mild fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis. The big question now is: Did you have Zika virus? And, if so, is your fetus still healthy?

""Probably every day, patients come in questioning whether or not they would qualify for testing,"" says Dr. Christine Curry, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Miami, and Jackson Memorial Hospital.

A preliminary study in Brazil makes a strong case for the link between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and a number of birth defects, including microcephaly. The infection has been associated with a range of outcomes in another study of nine U.S. women who caught the virus while traveling to regions where Zika is prevalent.

If a patient has a particular travel history, Curry sends a sample of the woman's blood to a lab for analysis. But it can take awhile for test results to come back, Curry says, and the waiting can be really stressful, especially for patients in the middle of a pregnancy.

""They're trying to decide what to do with the pregnancy, given so many unknowns,"" she says. ""The difference between two and four weeks can be the difference between being able to end a pregnancy and not.""

There's another problem: Some tests aren't very reliable, so patients sometimes have to go through multiple rounds to confirm whether they had Zika. That puts Curry in a tricky situation when she's counseling patients.

""It involves saying 'I don't know' and 'no one knows' over and over again,"" she says.

Until recently, most samples of fluids from patients had to be sent to Atlanta for testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now, about 30 local public health labs are gearing up to do the analysis themselves, including the District of Columbia's department of forensic sciences, where Cleveland Weeden works as a medical technologist.

Most days, Weeden says, he feels like an athlete stuck on the bench. Outbreaks are exciting, in a way, because he finally gets to put his expertise and skills to work.

""We're the bench,"" Weeden says. ""We get called into action when something goes on in the city.""

A refrigerator behind Weeden holds plastic baggies with tubes of blood and urine from patients in the area. As of this week, his job is to test all these samples for Zika virus.

Weeden expects to get the results to patients within three days, rather than four weeks. He's running a procedure called RT-PCR  or Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction. The CDC has produced about 375,000 kits that can perform this test. It looks for pieces of the virus' genetic material and answers ""yes"" or ""no"" to the question: ""Is there virus in this person's blood?""

Weeden says the test is pretty straightforward  except for one thing.

""From the time the person is bitten [by an infected mosquito] to the time they get to the doctor, no more than five to seven days can pass for us to [be able to] pick it up on PCR,"" he says.

That means that if PCR is to work, doctors have to collect patients' blood within a week of the first signs of a fever and rash. The virus hangs around a little longer in urine, so doctors would have a slightly longer window of time  about two weeks  to collect those samples. But there's an extra complication, Curry says: Most patients don't rush to the doctor when their illness is mild.

""If someone had virus in their blood three weeks ago and they're now cleared, the PCR's not going to tell you that,"" she says. In that case, a negative result could mean either that the person never had Zika, or that their body had already cleared it from their system by the time they got tested.

That's why labs like Weeden's are trying to get hold of another kind of test that the CDC developed, which goes by yet another bulky acronym  the Zika MAC-ELISA. This test looks for a protein in a person's blood  a specific type of antibody  that shows what foreign things the body has fought off recently.

The Zika MAC-ELISA is widely seen as the best test available, right now, because it works over a longer time span than the first option. It's also faster and cheaper than another more definitive test, and requires less specialized training to perform. According to the CDC, Zika antibodies appear in the blood ""starting 4 to 5 days after the start of illness and last for up to 12 weeks,"" or even longer in some people.

The CDC has produced about 100,000 of these test kits, and is offering them free to qualified labs. But there's one drawback: The test sometimes tells people they had Zika when they didn't.

An ideal test, all agree, would be specific to this particular virus and give a faster turnaround time  eliminating the need for the manpower, money and time required to go through the current layers of testing.

It's not just pregnant women who would benefit from a better test  so would patients who need blood transfusions in places like Puerto Rico, where health officials have been worried that patients might accidentally get Zika during transfusions with infected blood. So the officials have stopped accepting local donations and, instead, are now getting blood shipped in from the continental U.S.

The third, more definitive, test is called PRNT, or the plaque-reduction neutralization test. Because PRNT is expensive and takes at least a week longer to do than the Zika MAC-ELISA, the ELISA test is widely considered the more practical option in many cases.

""And herein lies where science needs to innovate a bit,"" says Ted Pierson, a virologist and senior investigator at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Sometime in December, Pierson and colleagues in his molecular virology lab dropped their work on dengue virus so they could press the pedal to the metal on Zika. Pierson's work doesn't focus on pregnant women or blood transfusions.

""I am focused on amino acids, hydroxyls and phosphates,"" he explains. His team is trying to figure out how to make a better version of the antibody test  the Zika MAC-ELISA test the CDC is distributing to labs.

""The problem here is actually quite simple,"" Pierson explains. Viruses in the same family  in Zika's case, the flaviviruses  can look similar on the outside, and the antibodies the human immune system uses to fight them can also be similar.

So, if a person had been infected sometime along the way with another mosquito-borne virus in that family, like dengue or West Nile  or even if they simply had been vaccinated against yellow fever  they could test positive in a Zika antibody test.

""It's a good example of where the devil is in the details,"" Pierson says, and those details are what he and his colleagues are delving into now.

""What we, as a field, need to do is develop antigens that allow us to distinguish between the antibodies specific to Zika, versus those for other flaviviruses,"" he says.

The group is essentially stripping down the virus to figure out what is unique to Zika  what distinguishes it from related viruses. The researchers are particularly interested in proteins, like the ""fusion loop,"" that lie on top of the virus and help it enter a human cell. Once those unique parts are identified, it might be possible to create a more specific test that has much lower odds of triggering false positives.

That could take days to figure out  or months, Pierson says.

""You just can't predict,"" he says. ""This is science. We just have to do the experiments.""

In the meantime, people across the country who have jobs like Cleveland Weeden's will be working long days.

""You get physically tired,"" Weeden admits. ""We're not robots. Your hands cramp up after you pipette so much. But that's what we're here for. We're public health scientists.""

As the weather warms and mosquitoes start flying around, these scientists will keep on testing with  they hope  better and better tools.",[]
