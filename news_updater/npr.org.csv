i toggle caption Karen Kasmauski/Corbis Karen Kasmauski/Corbis

The world is focused on finding a link between pregnant women infected with the Zika virus and severe birth defects. But two studies and an editorial in this week's New England Journal of Medicine are reminders that malaria, a disease that killed about half a million people in 2015, also has profound consequences for pregnant women and their infants. The new studies provide much-needed guidance on how to prevent and treat malaria during pregnancy.

""Malaria during pregnancy is a major public health concern,"" says Dr. Joel Tarning, Head of Clinical Pharmacology at Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand, and author of the NEJM editorial ""Treatment of Malaria in Pregnancy.""

Recommended treatment for malaria is artemisinin combination therapy, or ACT, a mix of drugs shown to effectively treat the disease. But until now, the treatment has not been tested on women expecting babies.

""Pregnant women are often excluded from clinical trials, which hampers the implementation of these drug treatments,"" says Tarning.

If malaria is left untreated during pregnancy, infected red blood cells gather in the placenta and block the crucial exchange of nutrients from mother to fetus. The result can be miscarriage, stillbirth and low birth weight, says Tarning.

In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria during pregnancy is thought to be responsible for 20 percent of low birth weight babies each year, leading to 100,000 infant deaths, according to a recent NEJM study.

In Africa many people are immune from malaria and show no symptoms when infected, but pregnancy reduces a woman's immunity. Even when an infected woman has no symptoms, the disease can still harm the fetus, again resulting in low birth weight, miscarriage or stillbirth.

Despite a lack of clinical trial evidence on how to safely and effectively prevent and treat malaria during pregnancy, the consequences of no treatment are severe.

""Not treating pregnant women with malaria is not an option, since this is a life-threatening disease,"" says Tarning.

So the current WHO recommendations are that women living in areas where malaria is prevalent sleep under pesticide-treated nets; that women be given two doses of malaria prevention drugs during their pregnancy; and that women with malaria be treated during the second and third trimester.

Those WHO guidelines on treating malaria in pregnant women haven't changed, but now, with good evidence that they are safe and effective, health ministries can be more confident in carrying them out.

""I hope that these studies provide the needed evidence for countries to use ACTs in the treatment of pregnant women with malaria,"" says Tarning.

And they provide support for being treated earlier in pregnancy. Tarning pointed out a new study in The Lancet Infectious Diseases that treatment with ACTs is safe and effective during the first trimester. ""It's time to reconsider first-trimester anti-malarial treatment recommendations,"" he says.

Just as important, he says, the studies show that in countries where many pregnant women are infected with malaria but show no symptoms because of built-up immunity, treatment with ACTs will benefit them and their unborn babies. ""Hopefully, this will start the debate on using ACTs as preventive treatment in this group,"" he says.

Now there is clear guidance on how malaria drugs affect pregnant women. In another study, 3,428 pregnant women with malaria from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Malawi and Zambia were treated with four different anti-malaria drug combinations. Cure rates ranged from 95 percent to 99.2 percent, with few side effects. And the study on preventive treatment in 300 pregnant women with no malaria symptoms found that the drug combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, one of the combination drugs, prevented the disease and raised no safety concerns.

These studies on malaria's effect on pregnant women, a group previously not studied adequately in clinical trials, should go a long way in protecting mothers and babies from the harmful consequences of the disease.",[]

i toggle caption Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty Images Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty Images

An investigation into a clinical test in France that left one person dead and put five in the hospital has found evidence of brain damage in people who took high doses of the experimental pain medicine.

The early-stage clinical study, conducted by Biotrial in France, was halted in January when the side effects surfaced. It was the first time the drug, made by the Portuguese company Bial and known as ""BIA 10-2474,"" was tested in humans.

A report released Monday by a committee of scientists says people who got high cumulative doses of the drug sustained damage to their brains, specifically the hippocampus and pons. Those who got lower doses had no consistent adverse reactions.

The reports says the patients' symptoms and injuries were ""completely unusual, with no relatedness to a known disease or toxicity.""

Previous tests in rats, mice, dogs and monkeys involved doses up to 650 times those given to human subjects. While some animals had brain damage or died when given extremely high doses, there were no consistent signs indicating the drug would be unsafe for humans.

The molecule is meant to inhibit an enzyme called fatty acid amide hydrolase with a central role in the endocannabinoid system, a set of receptors also involved in processing THC, an ingredient in marijuana.

In all, 90 people took the experimental drug, at different doses. The six who were hospitalized had gotten the highest dose, which was 10 to 40 times higher than that needed to completely block the enzyme.

""We don't know by what mechanism the molecule caused these lesions, and I fear we won't know it for a long time since they couldn't have been due to the endocannabinoid system that was targeted by the molecule,"" Dr. Bernard Begaud, who leads the scientific committee investigating the incident, told the French publication Sciences et Avenir.

Two similar compounds were abandoned by other companies because they weren't deemed effective.

Often, the intensity of a drug's side effects increase with the dose. But in this case, the investigators note, there was no sign of a linear pattern. People who received a cumulative dose less than 200 milligrams were, for the most part, fine. But all six patients who received a cumulative dose higher than 250 milligrams had ""serious central nervous system symptoms.""

At those doses, the report authors hypothesize, the molecule may have suppressed the target enzyme too much, preventing it from breaking down other chemicals. That may have allowed a chemical like anandamide, which is present in chocolate in tiny amounts, to build up to dangerous concentrations in the brain.

Another idea is that the molecule acted on unintended enzymes or that it produced toxic byproducts in the brain.

The group, set up by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, will reconvene later this month to review hypotheses on what went wrong and to make recommendations to the French government to improve clinical trial regulations.

The committee has also asked Bial to explain why the company did preliminary studies in four species of animals, as opposed to the usual two, why it decided to continue studies on the potential pain reliever when it only worked in two animal tests, and why it chose to test such high cumulative doses in people.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is also investigating the case. The agency said in late January that while this drug hasn't been tested in the U.S., there are studies on other drugs that work the same way.",[]

i toggle caption The Kobal Collection The Kobal Collection

Where would you go, if you had a time machine? Ancient Egypt? Tang Dynasty China? The Globe Theater, in 1599? Or maybe to the 25th century, because who knows, Buck Rogers might actually be there.

Sadly, no one's likely to invent a working time machine any time soon. But that hasn't stopped the legions of writers who've been exploring time travel ever since H. G. Wells described his first Morlock. Slips and drops and nets and projections and paradoxes  writers have thought up a hundred ways to travel backwards and forwards in time. And that's one of the great things about literary time travel: the way every writer seems to invent the mechanism all over again, every time they put pen to paper.

You can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

""We can actually do whatever we want,"" says science fiction author Connie Willis. She's won all kinds of awards for her tales of time-traveling historians  like Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog. Willis says the best thing about time travel is no one's invented it yet  so it can be whatever you want.



""You know, you can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

Well, within reason  don't go stepping on any ancient butterflies, or accidentally shooting your own grandfather. You don't want to cause a paradox. ""The trickiest part of writing time travel is the paradoxes,"" Willis says, ""because the truth is, you know, we can't go back in time, one of the reasons is, just by being there we would change things, you know, so that's what you spend most of your time doing!""

Avoiding paradoxes is especially tricky for Willis, who's generally keeping track of multiple characters jumping around to different points in time. ""And I have to remember, that happened earlier, but later, and hasn't happened yet  and I usually end up writing angry notes to myself at the head of every page: she still thinks he's a murderer!""

Unlike Willis's historians, I can't go back in time  but I can do the next best thing, which is to visit Readercon, a speculative fiction convention that happens every year in Boston. If anyone knows about time travel literature, it's these folks. In fact, this year they held an entire panel devoted to time travel. Panel moderator  and occasional NPR contributor  K. Tempest Bradford is working on a time travel novel herself, ""basically doing Shakespeare's Twelfth Night with time travel instead of shipwrecks,"" she says.

Part of the appeal of time travel, Bradford adds, is the lure of experiencing other times and places. But it's also a chance for a cosmic do-over. ""I know that if I were to travel back in time, I might warn some people that they shouldn't do this or that thing, or they should maybe be careful who they trade blankets with.""

Writer, bookseller and Readercon attendee Leah Bobet says the past is fascinating because it's the one place we can't go, ""and there are so many ways time travel stories both question and reinforce the past-is-past paradigm. And so it's grappling with regret, it's learning to emotionally deal with the consequences of the one thing we can't really undo.""

It tends to be the past that people talk about, when they talk about time travel. ""And that's interesting,"" says Bobet, ""because the future is always coming. The future's coming whether you like it or not, second by second by second  the past is never coming again.""

Unless, of course, you have a time machine  and that brings us to the quintessential time traveler's dilemma: Assuming you could get to Berlin in 1937, should you kill Hitler? ""Oh yeah,"" says Connie Willis. ""That's the dilemma of time travel, is that no event is unconnected to every other event. And so you could bring about something much worse. Except that Hitler was so bad and so unique, I have a tendency to think that given the chance, yeah. You betcha.""

Personally, I might go back to Sarajevo in 1914 and slip Gavrilo Princip a knockout drop instead. If I had a time machine.",[]

Nice work by all those involved in todays news from the Navy Yard. We did not fall into the traps that some other media outlets did. We stuck with what was known, we were clear about what was not known, and we stayed away from rumors.

A couple things to keep in mind:

 When passing along information to the lead editor(s) and Newsdesk-Eds@npr.org, please be as specific as you can about the source. For example, if the news is that the all clear has been given, tell us whos saying that. A police lieutenant you just spoke to? The public information officer on the scene? The mayors chief of staff? Knowing that will help Newscast, The Two-Way and editors as they sort through what are often conflicting reports.

 When passing along information, be clear about what you feel can be reported and what cannot be reported (but is something you want editors to be aware of). That will also help Newscast, The Two-Way and editors as they sort through what are often conflicting reports.

Again, those are points to keep in mind. But the most important thing to take away from today is how well we did when it came to reporting solid information and staying away from thinly sourced rumors. Thanks.

SAGAL: Well, it's nice to have you us, Brad. You're going to play the game in which you must try to tell truth from fiction. Bill, what is Brad's topic?

KURTIS: I prefer hardcover books. They're better to slap you with.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Literature is full of fierce disagreements. Think of last year's debate over Harper Lee's second book or two hobos fighting with knives at a library. This week...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: This week, we read about a new literary controversy. Our panelists are going to tell you about it. Pick the real one, you'll win our prize - Carl Kasell's voice on your voicemail. Are you ready to play?

BAKER: I am, indeed.

SAGAL: All right, well, first let's hear from Bobcat Goldthwait.

BOBCAT GOLDTHWAIT: Park Ranger and respected Sasquatch expert ranger Robert Lederman writes coming-of-age stories for tweens similar to ""Twilight"" series, except set in the world of Bigfoot. His first book ""Yeti Or Not"" was a...

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: ...Was a hit with the Bigfoot teen-lit crowd and other Bigfoot enthusiasts. But controversy arose when his follow-up ""Yeti Or Not: The Awakening...""

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: ...Added a group of wood nymphs and fairies to the saga. Serious Bigfoot researchers are irate. They say that by adding wood nymphs and fairies, Lederman is making the Bigfoot community big look ridiculous.

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: ""Fairies aren't real,"" exclaimed Timothy Pearson, a leading squatcher.

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: Even if they were wooden nymphs and fairies, Sasquatches would never associate with them. Bigfoot is a very private hominid. We're not asking Lederman to censor himself. We're just asking that his book comes with a warning label explaining that some of it is fiction.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Controversy in the Sasquatch lit community.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Sasquatch yes, wood nymphs, no. Your next story of fiction friction comes from Roxanne Roberts.

ROXANNE ROBERTS: The cat mystery world is hissing about a controversy in its industry - talking cats. What's that you say? Cat mysteries? Indeed, it's a popular genre of detective stories with little sex, violence or swearing...

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: ...With lots and lots of adorable kitties who speak English to humans - or should they? Shirley Rousseau Murphy's ""Joe Grey"" series features two talking cats who help the town police chief solve cases. Other authors create crime-solving cats who only meow. Quote, ""people tend to feel very strongly about it,"" author Clea Simon told The Wall Street Journal. ""Cats that speak - they're an abomination."" The Cat Writers' Association - yes, that's a thing, to...

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: ...Is firmly in the talking cat corner, awarding its top honors to books with chatty cats in the tradition of Puss in Boots and The Cat in the Hat. Quote, ""so many fans tell me they wish their cats could speak,"" said Murphy, who sold 1.3 million books. ""Sometimes I say, are you sure you want to know? Personally, I know exactly what my cats would say - forget that dead body and feed us. And then we'll lie on top of that newspaper you're trying to read.""

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Do cats talk? Yes, no, yes, no - a controversy of the cat lit community.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Finally, your last story of a beef in books comes from Adam Burke.

ADAM BURKE: A literary squabble has broken out at this year's annual celebration Putinalia in which artists and writers descend on the outskirts of St. Petersburg to see who can create the best homage to the city's favorite son, Russian leader Vladimir Putin. In the contentious poetry competition, runner-up Anatoly Neskerov has accused winner Edna Kedrov secretly satirizing the nation's doughty leader with her poem ""Our Father Is Brave And Beautiful,"" which contains the lines a herd of bears with gums in their teeth led by strapping Putin, his arms full of salmon. It is...

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: ...According to Neskerov, (imitating Russian accent) so over-the-top as to be a mockery. Kedrov has in turn accused Neskerov's work of being as over-the-top. ""Please, said Kedrov, the poem is about Putin pinning all of the world's heads of state in a judo match."" Festival organizers say this year's winner will stand but will impose strict rules on banning satire in the future.

SAGAL: All right, so these are your choices.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: From Bobcat Goldthwait, controversy in the world of Sasquatch literature when one of the favorite authors puts in wood fairies and wood fairies don't exist, from Roxanne Roberts, a controversy in the world of cat literature about whether the cats should talk or not or from Adam Burke, controversy over at the annual Putin literary competition, where two poets accuse each other of secretly satirizing their dear leader. Which of these is the real story of the a literary controversy?

BAKER: Well, number one - I think that's what I'm going for.

SAGAL: So you're going to go with Bobcat's story of Sasquatch lit being roiled by the introduction wood fairies, was it?

BAKER: Yeah.

SAGAL: Well, to bring you the correct answer, we spoke to someone intimately - and I mean intimately involved with the real story.

CLEA SIMON: There is a split between those who believe that cats should act simply like animals and those of us who believe that cats can talk.

SAGAL: That was Clea Simon. She is the author of four cat-related mystery series - not books, series - and she is a member in good standing of the Cat Writers' Association. So as you heard, Brad, Roxanne Roberts had the real story. You didn't win. You earned a point for Bobcat, which I'm sure he appreciates but which no doubt infuriates Roxanne. She'll have her vengeance later. Thank you so much for playing. Bye-bye.

Its been drilled into our heads that we should include at least a bit of a persons biography on first reference. So this guidance is a break from tradition. Here goes:

If someone is well-known, it will often feel and sound more natural to move that bio material to later in a Newscast spot, blog post or show piece. In some cases it may not even be necessary to include all the biographical information youre tempted to fold in.

For instance, rather than beginning with a reference to 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin or former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin or former Alaska governor and 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin, simply slip one of those reminders in later.

In most cases, theres no need to remind the audience on first reference that Hillary Clinton is a former secretary of state, former senator or former first lady. You may need to say Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton, but there are more conversational ways to get that information across as well. For instance, by talking about Hillary Clintons campaign for the White House and getting the word Democratic in at another point.

Its unlikely you would start a conversation with a friend by saying Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. You would say Bernie Sanders. In many cases, we can do the same and let the references to his run for the Democratic nomination, the senate and Vermont come in naturally.

This guidance is mostly about politicians, but can apply to others as well. Former Beatle doesnt always have to go in front of Paul McCartney. Oprah Winfrey can stand on her own for a line or two. Boxer Muhammad Ali may not be necessary on first reference.

Heres the takeaway: We dont have to be bound to the notion that first references must be mini resumes. Use your judgment.

Related notes:

 This does not change the way we refer to sitting presidents, vice presidents and other world leaders. Were sticking with formalities on first references to them.

 Party IDs are key information in stories about policy makers and politicians. If you dont include an R, a D, a Democrat or a Republican, you will hear from readers and listeners who say youre trying to hide someones affiliation.

 If the news is about legislation thats being introduced, a hearing thats being held, results of an investigation that are being released or other official business, we stick with tradition. It would be Sen. Jane Doe or Attorney Gen. John Doe on first reference.

 It should always be Conqueror of the Unpronounceable Word Korva Coleman on first reference.

i toggle caption Geoff Robins/AFP/Getty Images Geoff Robins/AFP/Getty Images

Tonight the two Democratic candidates  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders  meet in Miami for a debate.

Before Tuesday night, the debate was looking like an unimportant afterthought to a race that could have been all wrapped up. But not anymore, after Sanders' stunningly unexpected win in Michigan last night.

Here are three things to watch:

1. Delegates or momentum?

Hillary Clinton's campaign says all that matters is delegates and by that measure she succeeded Tuesday night  increasing her delegate lead over Bernie Sanders. But her loss to Sanders exposed troubling weaknesses for Clinton which she needs to address tonight.

How will she try to woo independents (which she lost) and white working class voters (which she almost lost)?

2. Sanders' new lease on life

Just when pundits were getting ready to call him irrelevant, Sanders is now set up nicely for Ohio  another big Rust Belt state that votes next Tuesday.

Tonight in Miami, will he raise the electability question: If Clinton lost Michigan to a Democratic populist in March, why wouldn't she lose Michigan to a Republican populist (Donald Trump) in November?

3. The enthusiasm gap

Republicans keep on posting high turnout levels. Democratic turnout is below 2008 levels.

In addition, the news media are inclined to cover a rambling 45-minute infomercial by Trump  billed as a presidential style news conference  instead of speeches by the other candidates.

If Trump is the nominee and continues to drive ratings, the Democrats might be gasping for airtime this fall.",[]

Meanwhile heres a reminder, from the Ethics Handbook:

Be sure to consider legal issues when dealing with minors (generally defined as anyone under the age of 18). An interview of a minor about a sensitive subject requires us to secure permission from at least one of the minors parents (preferably both) or a legal guardian. Examples of sensitive subjects include cheating, sexual activity, involvement in gangs or crime, difficult family relationships, probation violation, out-of-wedlock pregnancy or parenthood, victims sexual abuse and similar topics that could have legal ramifications or lead to embarrassment. An interview of a minor in a special custodial situation, such as foster care, juvenile detention, or holding facilities for illegal immigrants, requires the consent of the person who has custody of the minor. Utah also requires the consent of both the custodian of the juvenile facility and the minors parent. An interview on a non-sensitive topic (normal childhood activities, sports, book, movies, trips to the zoo, baseball and the like) does not require consent. Generally however, any interview on school premises will require the permission of the school authorities. In cases where there is even a hint of doubt about whether to get consent, contact our legal team (look for LegalAlert in the NPR internal email address book).

It's by the Singaporean writer and illustrator Sonny Liew, who was born in Malaysia, studied philosophy at Cambridge University and is best known in the U.S. for his DC Comics series Doctor Fate about an Egyptian-American superhero. His new graphic novel, his biggest and most ambitious work, spans decades. Here's John's review of ""The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye.""

JOHN POWERS, BYLINE: It wasn't so long ago that comics were considered artistically marginal, adolescent fantasy. All that changed with the 1986 release of ""Maus."" Art Spiegelman's graphic novel - as they're now called - tackled the Holocaust and its effect on his family. ""Maus"" won a Pulitzer Prize and unleashed the ongoing wave of masterful books that includes Alan Moore's ""Watchmen,"" Chris Ware's ""Jimmy Corrigan"" and Allison Bechdel's ""Fun Home."" Grappling with everything from sex and politics to violence and alienation, these comics took you places that you haven't gone before.

That happens again in ""The Art of ""Charlie Chan Hock Chye,"" a startlingly brilliant tour de force by the Singapore artist and writer Sonny Liew. Although the premise sounds simple - it's the biography of a fictional comic book artist - what Liew does with it is anything but. At once dizzyingly meta and deeply heartfelt, the book spans 80 years and in its complicated layering remind me of everything from ""Maus"" and ""The Tin Drum"" to, believe it or not, ""Ulysses.""

The book's hero is Chan Hock Chye. His English-language name in a little joke is Charlie. Chan is born in 1938 Singapore. And from the beginning, this shopkeeper's son loves to draw. When he first discovers comic books at the local library, he's forever smitten. He dedicates his whole life to making them, becoming a monk of the craft. Never married, he turns down commercial jobs to spend decades creating comics that don't make money. But while Chan personally leads a quiet, almost invisible existence, his career is shot through with the great drama of history.

He lives through the epic transformation of his tiny island home from a Third World outpost of the British Empire to a sleek country often called the Switzerland of Asia, clean, orderly and so prosperous that its per capita GDP is one and a half times our own. Over the years, Chan experiences the Japanese invasion of World War II, Singapore's messy struggle for independence and the eventual emergence of a seemingly all-powerful ruling party. He watches this skillfully run if sometimes repressive state become a safe haven where billionaires move to stash their cash.

Now, Liew doesn't present this transformation so baldly. We watch it happen by reading the comics that Chan supposedly creates about these events. Of course, Liew himself creates them all, both naive and sophisticated, with dazzling virtuosity. Man, can this guy draw. Giving us a grand tour of comic book history, he works in styles that reference everything from Britain's ""The Beano"" and Japanese manga to Mad Magazine, ""Pogo,"" ""Spiderman,"" even Scrooge McDuck. Every page hums with visual invention, including those pages in which Liew himself turns up, a bespectacled little dude, to comment on the action.

Although ""The Art Charlie Chan Hock Chye"" is probably the greatest work of art ever produced in Singapore, the book was controversial there. It's not a country big on dissent, and Liew points out the cracks in the official myths erected by the party that's ruled for the last half-century. Yet at the same time, he hasn't written a subversive tract or poisoned pen letter.

Even as he regrets the country's missed opportunities, the book is filled with affection, even love. It's a Valentine to cartooning, to old buildings and street food, to heroes written out of official history, to ordinary people trying to make a better life. Most moving and most universal is Liew's portrait of the artist as a young, middle-aged and old man. By today's standards, Chan would be considered a failure. His work doesn't sell. His apartment is modest. And as the country around him grows richer and glossier, he lives in obscurity, all alone, creating comics about a success-mad culture that ignores him.

Near the end, the aging Chan jets to San Diego to attend Comic-Con in hopes of finding kindred spirits and maybe landing some work. The trip doesn't pan out, yet he doesn't let this disappointment stop him. Back home, surrounded by his pens and ink bottle, he keeps doing what he's always done - pursuing his art in the face of a world that doesn't seem to want it. You see, Chan would rather remain marginal forever than give up doing what he cares about most. And Liew makes it heartbreakingly clear that such devotion is one of the highest forms of grace.

GROSS: John Powers is film and TV critic for Vogue and vogue.com. He reviewed ""The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye"" by Sonny Liew.

It took Abdul Arian months to realize that his decision to migrate from his home country, Afghanistan, to Germany was a huge mistake.

He set off nearly a year ago, hoping to be granted asylum so that he could go to university and study psychology.

His journey, organized by smugglers, was long and perilous. Arian, 24, says he nearly drowned off the shores of Greece, when the inflatable dinghy he was traveling in capsized.

He says he and his fellow travelers got lost somewhere in Hungary and walked through the rain for 24 hours before they found the path again.

Yet the reason that Arian finally saw his mistake was not because something nasty or dangerous happened to him. It was because nothing really happened at all.

When Arian arrived in Germany, he was placed in a migrants' reception center.

""We had nothing to do in the camp,"" he says. ""We just stayed there.""

He played a lot of soccer. He ate a lot of jelly sandwiches. He moped about. Officials wrote down his name. In the end, he says, he was in Germany for 10 months, yet ""no one asked me why I went there and why I was there."" No one seemed to want to listen to him explain why he should be allowed to stay.

It also soon became clear to Arian that local Germans did not appreciate his presence. While people from the church and social workers helped the migrants and were ""very nice,"" residents of the nearby village seemed hostile.

""When we were walking along the sidewalk, people would avoid us,"" says Arian.

Germany Says Many Must Leave

Last year, 150,000 Afghans arrived in Germany. The German authorities estimate less that half qualify for asylum.

German officials say at present a tiny number of Afghans  1,600, according to estimates given to them by Afghan officials in Germany  are willing to go back home voluntarily.

But many will have to leave, says Germany's ambassador to Afghanistan, Markus Potzel.

""It means that more than half of them have to be sent back because they can't stay,"" says Potzel. ""There are some obstacles for them to be sent back immediately, but we have a huge number of Afghans who are not eligible to stay in Germany and should be sent back.""

During Arian's time in Germany, he began to notice that Syrian migrants were being treated very differently. They were provided with language lessons and eventually passports, he says.

""When we complained to the social workers, they responded frankly. They said, 'We've invited Syrians here, not Afghans,' "" he says.

This prompted some of Arian's fellow Afghans to stage demonstrations.

""They were shouting, 'We don't want to go back to Afghanistan! There is a war there!' "" he says. ""But no one listened to them.""

The weeks rolled by. Arian was moved to another center. But still nothing happened. He grew steadily more convinced that he had no chance of being allowed to stay in Germany. Then depression set in.

""I was in very bad condition. I couldn't sleep. I decided to go back to Afghanistan, before I went crazy,"" he says.

Arian returned home last month. He was one of 125 Afghans sent back to Afghanistan on a charter flight organized by the German and Afghan governments. The passengers all signed a form saying they were returning voluntarily.

Arian's family spent most of their savings on his trip to Germany. To pay the smuggler's bill of $7,500, they sold land and a car. Arian is now worrying about what his family feels about that.

""So far, I haven't seen any reaction from them because I've just arrived back. But I don't know what's in their hearts,"" he says.

Arian is faced with finding work amid rampant unemployment in a society where good jobs are very hard to find without political or personal connections  or cash for a hefty bribe.

Humiliation For Some

That much is clear from the experience of Shirdil Bayat, 40. He was deported from Denmark two years ago, after a court rejected his request for asylum  which he'd based on a claim that his life was threatened by the Taliban in his home city, Kandahar.

Lacking personal connections, Bayat took 16 months to find permanent work as an office cleaner in the capital, Kabul. He says returning home to Kandahar is still too risky. On a recent day when he was interviewed by NPR, he'd been laid off because of budget cuts. He says he has no idea what he'll do next.

Bayat says returning to Afghanistan after having failed in Europe can be very humiliating. Some families are sympathetic, but far from all.

""People jeer at you. They ask, 'Why did so-and-so get citizenship in Europe while you did not? Maybe you're useless,' "" he says.

The Germans are running a PR campaign in Afghanistan, trying to deter Afghans from traveling to their land. They've posted announcements on billboards, buses and the Internet, urging Afghans to think twice before setting off.

Germany views many of the Afghans who've arrived on its soil as economic migrants seeking jobs or education.

German officials maintain that under international law, Germany is not required to grant asylum to those migrants  unlike Syrians, who are fleeing a war zone.

The United Nations estimates that last year, some 11,000 civilians were killed or injured by conflict in Afghanistan. Afghans say that bolsters proof that there is war in Afghanistan, too  and that Afghans should therefore be granted protection by European nations.

""Afghans are not leaving Afghanistan because of a lack of jobs, "" says Ashraf Haidari, director-general of policy and strategy at Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry. ""They are fleeing generalized violence. Terrorism that is killing men, women and children,"" he says. ""That - and political uncertainty as a result of withdrawal of international forces and diminishing international development aid.""

Germany Draws A Distinction

However, Potzel, Germany's ambassador, says the situation in Afghanistan differs hugely from Syria's.

""Here in Afghanistan, you don't have a government who would bomb their own population,"" he says. ""Here, the government tries to protect their own people. There are unsafe regions and there are less unsafe regions in Afghanistan, and there are regions  especially in the big cities  where a sort of normal life is going on.""

Germany is one of the main international donors to Afghanistan. Over the last 14 years, it has poured a great deal of money into the country. It seems unlikely that it would wish to risk making Afghanistan still more unstable by forcibly returning large numbers of Afghans over a short time span.

Yet there is considerable concern in Afghanistan about what might happen if significant numbers of angry and disillusioned young Afghans are eventually sent back from Europe.

Some European countries provide financial support packages to help people settle in, but the sums are generally small and over a limited time period.

Professor Sayed Masoud, an economist based in Kabul, foresees ""disaster.""

""Either they will join the Taliban or become drug addicts,"" he says, ""because the government can't provide jobs.""

Meanwhile, Afghans keep heading on the trail to Europe. On a recent early morning in Kabul, hundreds of men were lined up outside the government office that issues passports.

Among them was Wahidullah Mohammadi, 19, who wants to migrate to Europe to go to school. He is aware of the risk of being deported back home  and of losing the thousands of dollars he'll pay to smugglers.

Still, he still thinks the odds are worth it.

""The situation is not good here and there is no guaranteed future,"" he says. ""This is why I have to accept this risk.""",[]

In the past, falling oil prices have given a boost to the world economy, but recent forecasts for global growth have been ratcheted down, even as oil prices sink lower and lower. Does that mean the link between lower oil prices and growth has weakened?

Jason Bordoff, head the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, says there are still good reasons to believe cheap oil should heat up the world economy.

""Consumers have more money in their pockets when they're paying less at the pump,"" says Bordoff. ""They spend that money on other things, which stimulates the economy.""

Sara Johnson, director of global economic research at IHS, says the biggest gains goes to countries that import most or all of their oil  China, Japan, India, South Korea, Germany and France. The United states also remains a net importer of oil, despite huge increases in U.S. production from the shale oil boom.

As the list suggests, the countries most likely to benefit have big economies and lots of consumers.

But doesn't the extra money in the pockets of those countries' consumers mean an equal loss in oil-producing countries, making the total economic effect a wash? Not necessarily, says Johnson.

Many oil producers built up huge reserve funds when prices were high, she says  so ""when prices fall they will draw [on] their reserves to support government spending and subsidies for their consumers.""

Bordoff says Saudi Arabia, with reserves of around $600 billion, is a good example. A vast number of Saudi paychecks come from government employment. Using that money means that, when oil prices drop, ""the economy doesn't feel it as directly, day to day, in terms of people's paychecks,"" he says. Even when oil prices fall, Saudi consumers can keep spending.

Venezuela's Free-Fall

But not all oil producers have big reserves. In Venezuela, for instance, collapsing oil prices have sent its economy into free-fall.

""It's been ravaged with shortages of basic foodstuffs,"" Bordoff says. ""You can't find everyday necessities, like toilet paper, on supermarket shelves.""

Venezuela's inflation rate has skyrocketed to 800 percent, and the country's economic collapse is subtracting from global growth. To a lesser extent, growth in Nigeria, Russia and even in the United States is being hurt by the damage to their oil sectors.

Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, believes that the negative effects of plunging oil prices are swamping the positive effects of cheaper oil. He says the tip-off is a sharp decline in global trade, which has slumped partly because oil-producing nations can't afford to import as much as they used to.

""The value of world trade has gone down by 14 percent, year over year,"" says Weinberg, quoting figures from the International Monetary Fund. That's the biggest drop in the post-World War II period, except for the decline during the financial crisis of 2008, he says: ""In fact we're talking about reducing world GDP growth from about 3 percent to about 1.5 percent, using the measures that the IMF uses  and that's a pretty catastrophic year.""

Pressure On World Growth

IMF forecasters continue to expect global growth in the 3 percent range, but Weinberg doesn't think those numbers will hold up.

Both Jason Bordoff and Sara Johnson acknowledge the global economic benefit from a fall in oil prices today is likely lower than it was in the past. One reason is that more countries are big oil producers now, so the nations suffering from the price drop account for a larger share of the global economy.

Also, Bordoff says consumers, in the United States at least, are acting cautiously with the windfall they're getting at the gas pump.

""We're seeing, coming out of the Great Recession, that consumers are saving a larger percentage,"" says Bordoff, ""rather than going out and spending it.""

And a number of oil producing countries, including Saudi Arabia, are trimming their gasoline subsidies and raising taxes, Bordoff says, so the net savings for global consumers is not as big as the oil price plunge might suggest.",[]

No matter where you are in Tucson, Ariz., you're no more than 20 miles from Saguaro National Park. The park and its tall, pronged, namesake cactus literally surround Tucson. There's the rounded top of the park's cactus-studded Wasson Peak to the west, the park's desert-to-forest Rincon Mountain Range to the east and about a million people living between.

But if you go around Tucson  to its historic barrio neighborhoods, swap meets or hiking trails  and ask people about their neighboring national park, you might be surprised.

""Saguaro High School?""

""I have no idea.""

""What's that?""

Darla Sidles, Saguaro National Park's superintendent, is not surprised by those responses. She knows better than most the disconnect that exists between a lot of locals here and the park next door. ""The type of people that are coming to the park versus the people just five minutes away in Tucson is really an issue for us here,"" she says.

The reason: The type of people that are coming to the park don't reflect the type of people living in the community. Tucson is about 44 percent Hispanic or Latino. Of the park's roughly 650,000 annual visitors, less than 2 percent self-identify as Hispanic. ""If we're not being relevant to almost half of the population, then 30, 40, 50 years from now, the park isn't going to matter to them,"" Sidles says.

A Call To Action

The disconnect between Tucson's minority populations and Saguaro National Park is striking given their proximity, but it's hardly unique.

The National Park Service overall has a diversity problem. There were a record 307.2 million visits to U.S. national parks in 2015, and it's fair to say that the majority of those visitors were white. The National Park Service doesn't track the demographics of its visitors, but the most recent survey commissioned by the Park Service to see how different populations groups related to the parks found that 9 percent of American visitors were Hispanic. African-Americans accounted for 7 percent. Asian-Americans were 3 percent. Collectively, minorities made up just over 20 percent of the visitors to national parks, despite the fact that they made up nearly 40 percent of the U.S. population.

toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR

""We know that visitation does not reflect the diversity of the nation,"" says Jon Jarvis, the director of the National Park Service. ""And that's a concern.""

It's a concern on multiple levels. For one, the national parks depend on public money, political support and community engagement for funding. The Census Bureau is projecting that non-whites will make up the majority of the U.S. population within the next 25 years. Urbanization is growing. And millennials are now the biggest generation in history. Add that all up and it's not hard to predict that multicultural, mostly-urban millennials ""will assume all seats of power and responsibilities for the nation,"" Jarvis says. ""So connecting to that generation is essential to the Park Service's ability to thrive in our second century.""

The other reason it's important to connect to all of America's shifting demographics, Jarvis says, is it's the Park Service's job. ""The Park Service has a responsibility that Congress and the president have granted us over our history,"" he says.

To that end, Jarvis has made increasing diversity at the national parks a top priority as the Park Service approaches its centennial. His Call to Action plan  a vision for the organization's future  states: ""In our second century, we will fully represent our nation's ethnically and culturally diverse communities.""

'This Is Not Your Space'



Figuring out why there's a disconnect between Tucson's minority groups and Saguaro National Park is about to be Cam Juarez's job. Juarez, from Tucson, is a leader in the Hispanic community serving on the city's school board. In a couple of weeks, he's going to start working for Saguaro National Park as their outreach coordinator.

toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR

Juarez getting a jump start on that by visiting a couple of schools in Tucson to ask parents, teachers, administrators and students if they know about Saguaro and, if not, why. He's also going to try to get them interested in the park and what it has to offer. ""It's like we're out there selling snake oil,"" he says on the way to a charter school in south Tucson, which is predominantly Hispanic. ""I'd wager to say that there's a whole lot of folks here that don't use the park, close as they are to it.""

In a way, Juarez is the perfect person for this job because he can relate. To date, he says, he's visited three national parks, including Saguaro. Growing up, his family never went to national parks. They never even talked about it. ""It just wasn't something we did,"" he says.

His family was poor. ""We didn't have camping gear or fishing gear,"" he says. ""We had hoes and shovels; work implements and school books.""

Even as he got older, Juarez says, he thought of national parks as a place for ""folks that were white or folks that had resources and sometimes you likened them to each other."" Either way, he didn't think the parks were for people like him.

He's not alone in that sentiment. That survey of park visitors released in 2011 found that non-whites were three times more likely to say that parks provide poor service and are not safe places to visit. And Juarez heard some of that at the schools he went to.

Oscar Medina, a teacher at Changemaker High School, talked about how he visited a park with his family ""and none of the information signs were in Spanish."" A mom at Carrillo Intermediate talked about how she wanted to go to Saguaro with her family, but there weren't facilities for a large group. Another pointed out there's no public transportation.

Some of the reasons were universal: the cost is prohibitive; not enough time because of work; the lack of shade in a desert park.

i toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR

Others were more subtle. Luis Perales, the chief academic officer at Changemaker High School, says that the reasons minorities, and particularly Latinos, aren't going to national parks is that ""spaces either are inviting or are rejecting in many ways. And I think a lot of what's been created [with national parks] is this idea that this is not your space.""

It's not that Latinos don't want to go outside. Go to any park or hiking trail in Tucson and you'll see that's not the case. It's that they might want to have a different experience in the outdoors. A lot of what the national parks promote is the solitude and quiet of a John Muir photo. ""Go out on your own, enjoy nature, don't harm it,"" Perales says. That messaging of ""rugged individualism"" doesn't necessarily work with Latinos, Perales says. ""It's like no, I'm going to bring my whole family, we're going to be loud, we're going to explore,"" he says. ""That's not what's promoted at this point. It has to be a compromise.""

'Reflect The Face Of The People We Want To Attract'

There's another reason that people gave for not feeling connected or welcome at the national parks, and it's one that many people danced around. Bella Furr, an intern and temporary worker at Saguaro National Park had no such qualms: ""The other thing is the Park Service is full of white men.""

That's not entirely accurate, but it's not far off the mark. According to the most recent survey, 80 percent of Park Service's roughly 22,000 employees are white. Anecdotally, people involved with the Park Service say, the demographics breakdown of the Park Service's estimated 220,000 volunteers is similar.

At Saguaro National Park, Sidles estimates about 75 percent of their workforce is white. ""We don't have as diverse a staff as we should have,"" she says. ""We have to reflect the face of the people we want to attract.""

That idea of reflecting the diversity of the public in its workforce is one the National Park Service has been pushing for a long time. Programs have been in put place nationally and initiatives have been launched, but little has changed. That's bred some cynicism about the service's efforts in some quarters. One former long-time National Park Service employee interviewed for this story not-so-jokingly said that the National Park Service could also be celebrating the centennial of its efforts to be more diverse.

There's a myriad of reasons park managers and officials give for the slow rate of change. There's the labyrinthian federal job application system as well as preferential hiring mandates that can keep the resumes of diverse, local candidates off of hiring manager's desks. More directly, there's low job turnover and few new opportunities for diverse candidates. With baby boomers nearing retirement though, that's expected to change and open opportunities for more diversity.

i toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR

Saguaro National Park wants to be ready for that opportunity and being ready means having young, diverse, experienced candidates for jobs as they come open. That's why they've partnered with the nonprofit group Friends of Saguaro National Park to hire a group of young locals like Yesenia Gamez on temporary contracts.

Gamez is what's called a Next Generation Ranger. She works at Saguaro National Park's visitor centers and in its interior, but she also works in Tucson, visiting local schools and working at information stands at local events.

On a recent weekend, she showed off a big bleached grizzly bear skull to a group of young kids at community health event at a park in downtown Tucson. They guessed what animal it was.

Gamez says she loves doing events like this because she gets to interact with people who otherwise don't get to experience the park. ""People that come to the park are usually retirees who can drive out there,"" she says. ""This is a low socioeconomic thing. It's in the heart of Tucson. It's kind of like we're bringing the park to them.""

By doing that, she says, the Next Gen Rangers can provide a friendly, familiar face and appeal to people where they're comfortable. They can also tell younger versions of themselves about the opportunities that exist in the National Park Service  if those opportunities exist.",[]

Slovenia, Serbia and Croatia have closed their borders to all ""irregular"" travelers, save those with immediate humanitarian needs. This effectively shuts down the Balkan route to Europe.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

Well, the door to Europe is closing. Three Balkan nations that have served as a pathway north from Greece announced that they will no longer be allowing anyone in without a visa. Those countries are Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia. This means migrants who are struggling to reach northern Europe along what's called the Balkan route are now blocked. Tens of thousands of people are now stuck in Greece, an EU member state. And let's talk to reporter Joanna Kakissis, who has been covering this story. She's in Athens this morning. Joanna, good morning.

JOANNA KAKISSIS, BYLINE: Good morning, David.

GREENE: So why now? Why are these Balkan countries deciding to do this right now?

KAKISSIS: Well, you know, they really had no choice after Austria imposed these very severe border restrictions last month. Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia - these are all parts of what used to be Yugoslavia. And they have long said they don't have the resources to care for very large groups of asylum seekers. Migrants were just transiting through these countries, as you mentioned. So sometimes they only stayed a few hours before going on to the next border. But with northern Europe closing to migrants, Balkan countries worry that lots of Syrians and Iraqis would be stuck there, just as is happening now in Greece.

GREENE: Well, and I've been listening to some of your reporting along the Greek-Macedonian border. I mean, some of those borders have already been tightening. And it sounds like just a terrible scene with people just stuck trying to get through.

KAKISSIS: Yeah, that's right. There are a lot of desperate people at the border. There are currently more than 35,000 Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans stuck in Greece - in crowded camps mostly. And along that border, the Greek-Macedonian border, there are about 14,000 people camped out in tents. When I was there, the conditions were terrible. And they continue to be terrible. It's muddy. There are few toilets and showers. I saw lots of moms waiting in these super long lines for, like, three, four hours for food. I saw lots of sick little kids. I met Fadi Kamar Aldeen at this camp. He's a lawyer from Idlib, Syria. His wife, Randa. His wife, Randa, was a physics teacher back home. They have three young children and they want to go to Germany. And Fadi was hoping German officials would do something about the border closures.

FADI KAMAR ALDEEN: They must help us, you know? We have bigger problem. These people, these children, these women must stay in good place in peace.

KAKISSIS: In peace - so some people may ask, well, Greece is peaceful - isn't it? Yes, yes, it is peaceful. But it's not prepared to house huge numbers of destitute people.

GREENE: Well, and, Joanna, I guess we should remember, I mean, Fadi, this lawyer, talking about his desires to get to Germany - Germany has been more welcoming than other European countries. But the problem is the countries in between have really been shutting these borders down, just stopping people like him from getting there.

KAKISSIS: Yes, and that's because there's a sentiment going around Europe that too many migrants are coming in, too many people that Europeans are going to have to support. And there are several countries that don't want any migrants at all. They don't want to share the burden. So Germany may still be saying you're welcome, but there are several other countries that say you're not.

GREENE: And what about the finger-pointing at Greece? I mean, that it sounds like is becoming much more intense - countries basically saying to the Greeks, this is your problem, you've got to deal with it.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: Yeah, I mean, Slovakia and Austria, for example, have been saying that Greece doesn't know how to patrol its sea borders, that it should seal its sea borders. They're getting - they're lecturing the Greeks on this. And the Greeks are outraged that two landlocked nations are telling them how to patrol their own coast. In Slovakia, the prime minister is echoing Donald Trump and saying no Muslim migrants will ever enter his country. He's even gone as far as saying that Greece should be kicked out of Europe's passport-free zone for failing to patrol its borders.

GREENE: What's next for people like Fadi who you spoke to who are sitting along that border?

KAKISSIS: Well, the EU is now pushing Greece to finish reception centers that could house tens of thousands of people with the idea that the migrants currently in Greece will be here a really long time. And that's very, very scary for people like Fadi and his family. They haven't showered for two weeks because there are no showers there. And they have been sending me messages this morning saying, OK, we're losing hope. We're going to stay here. They just don't know how to get from Greece to Germany.

GREENE: OK, that's reporter Joanna Kakissis speaking to us from Athens. Joanna, thanks.

KAKISSIS: You're welcome, David.

A look back at our coverage of what happened to Illinois police Lt. Charles Gliniewicz, who authorities now say killed himself, highlights the importance of attributing information and not getting ahead of ourselves when stories are breaking and investigations are under way.

Here are lines from five stories we aired or posted in the first few days after the news broke:

 Gliniewicz was shot to death in the line of duty on Tuesday  while chasing three suspects on foot.

 Investigators acknowledge they still only have vague descriptions of the three men Fox Lake police officer Charles Joseph Gliniewicz was trying to apprehend when he was shot and killed Tuesday morning.

 Lt. Gliniewicz was pursuing those suspectstwo white men and a black man on foot when he lost radio contact with a dispatcher.

 Before he was shot and killed Tuesday morning, Lt Charles Joseph Gliniewicz told dispatchers he was pursing three suspicious men on foot  two of them white and the third, black.

 The officer radioed to dispatchers that he was going to check on suspicious activity around 8 a.m. local time in the community of Fox Lake, Lake County sheriffs office spokesman Christopher Covelli said at a news conference. The officer, who has not yet been identified, then said he was in a foot pursuit, before losing contact. Covelli said responding officers arrived and found the officer injured from a gunshot wound and without his service weapon. The officer died at the scene.

The first three examples flatly say that Gliniewicz was chasing suspects when he was shot. The last two examples make it clear that Gliniewicz said he was in pursuit of three suspects.

Examples 1-3 skipped a key fact  that it was Gliniewicz who reported he was chasing three suspects. He was the source for that information. He was a single source. In hindsight, the attribution was critical.

Two other phrases in our early reports are interesting to think about now: Shot to death and shot and killed. Gliniewicz was shot. He did die. However, those phrases make it sound as if someone else did the shooting. If we had known he took his own life, we wouldnt have used them. We couldnt have known that, of course. But theres a case to be made that we should have thought through the possibilities and said before he was shot and died or some other phrasing that didnt include the word killed.

Mary Lattimore is a classically trained harpist from Philadelphia who incorporates experimental techniques and technologies into her music. She has performed and recorded with Kurt Vile, Sharon Van Etten, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth and Steve Gunn, among others; and is a frequent collaborator of Philly producer and multi-instrumentalist Jeff Zeigler. Lattimore's newest album, At the Dam, is the result of a prestigious fellowship she received in 2014 from the Pew Center for Arts & Heritage. She used the grant to fund a road trip across America with her harp and laptop, writing and recording songs at stops along the way, drawing inspiration from the locations, and letting the environments help define her work. The result is evocative, delicate and haunting music. The album is named for a Joan Didion essay about the Hoover Dam. ""It's enchanting, grandiose practicality, operating in its own solitude, even when humans aren't around,"" says Lattimore.

The tranquil ""Otis Walks Into the Woods"" was written in Marfa, Texas, after a visit to her family in North Carolina. About the song Lattimore says: ""I was traveling across the country with my great friend Natalie in my Volvo station wagon. I stopped home to see my parents in Polkville before picking up Natalie in Asheville. They live on the Lattimore family farm, which has some pastures, woods, a family cemetery, and have restored my great-grandfather's birthplace. We had a sweet blind black lab named Otis, an older dog, and he stuck close to the back door. The farm cats would sleep on his back and the other dog Gracie would nestle beside him. He was a cozy old guy. Before going to bed herself, my mom would let him inside to sleep on a blanket in the room off of the screened-in porch. After my visit, Natalie and I were driving through Louisiana and mom called to let me know that when she went to let Otis into the house that night, he was nowhere to be found. Dad went looking for him with Gracie and the flashlight, went deep into the woods to look for him, but he vanished without a trace. They looked and looked for weeks, but never saw a sign of him ever again. When Natalie and I got to Marfa, I set up to record at a friend's place and Otis was still on my mind, so I made him a song. I guess noble animals leave the pack to pass away in solitude and Otis, even being blind, found his way to where he wanted to go. It's a sad story but it's an ode to our pet.""

The video for ""Otis Walks Into the Woods"" captures a similarly peaceful, restful, elegant state of emotion. Shot and edited by Derrick Belcham, and choreographed and performed by Emily Terndrup and Maxwell Perkins. Lattimore says Belcham ""had this footage of dancers at the Philip Johnson Glass House, a place where I've played several times and I feel is an incredible gem."" The mini-movie captures a calm spirituality infused in Lattimore's repetitive, affecting music. It's a great match.

npr.org,,Iron Council,[],"Excerpt: Iron Council

Chapter One

A man runs. Pushes through thin bark-and-leaf walls, through the purposeless rooms of Rudewood. The trees crowd him. This far in the forest there are aboriginal noises. The canopy rocks. The man is heavy-burdened, and sweated by the unseen sun. He is trying to follow a trail.

Just before dark he found his place. Dim hotchi paths led him to a basin ringed by roots and stone-packed soil. Trees gave out. The earth was tramped down and stained with scorching and blood. The man spread out his pack and blanket, a few books and clothes. He laid down something well-wrapped and heavy among loam and centipedes.

Rudewood was cold. The man built a fire, and with it so close the darkness shut him quite out, but he stared into it as if he might see something emergent. Things came close. There were constant bits of sound like the bronchial call of a nightbird or the breath and shucking of some unseen predator. The man was wary. He had pistol and rifle, and one at least was always in his hand.

By flamelight he saw hours pass. Sleep took him and led him away again in little gusts. Each time he woke he breathed as if coming out of water. He was stricken. Sadness and anger went across his face.

""I'll come find you,"" he said.

He did not notice the moment of dawn, only that time skidded again and he could see the edges of the clearing. He moved like he was made of twigs, as if he had stored up the night's damp cold. Chewing on dry meat, he listened to the forest's shuffling and paced the dirt depression.

When finally he heard voices he flattened against the bank and looked out between the trunks. Three people approached on the paths of leaf-mould and forest debris. The man watched them, his rifle steadied. When they trudged into thicker shanks of light, he saw them clearly and let his rifle fall.

""Here,"" he shouted. They dropped foolishly and looked for him. He raised his hand above the earth rise.

They were a woman and two men, dressed in clothes more ill-suited to Rudewood than his own. They stood before him in the arena and smiled. ""Cutter."" They gripped arms and slapped his back.

""I heard you for yards. What if you was followed? Who else is coming?""

They did not know. ""We got your message,"" the smaller man said. He spoke fast and looked about him. ""I went and seen. We were arguing. The others were saying, you know, we should stay. You know what they said.""

""Yeah, Drey. Said I'm mad.""

""Not you.""

They did not look at him. The woman sat, her skirt filling with air. She was breathing fast with anxiety. She bit her nails.

""Thank you. For coming."" They nodded or shook Cutter's gratitude off: it sounded strange to him, and he was sure to them too. He tried not to make it sound like his sardonic norm. ""It means a lot."" * * * They waited in the sunken ground, scratched motifs in the earth or carved figures from dead wood. There was too much to say.

""So they told you not to come?""

The woman, Elsie, told him no, not so much, not in those words, but the Caucus had been dismissive of Cutter's call. She looked up at him and down quickly as she spoke. He nodded, and did not criticise.

""Are you sure about this?"" he said, and would not accept their desultory nods. ""Godsdammit are you sure? Turn your back on the Caucus? You ready to do that? For him? It's a long way we've got to go.""

""We already come miles in Rudewood,"" said Pomeroy.

""There's hundreds more. Hundreds. It'll be bastard hard. A long time. I can't swear we'll come back.""

I can't swear we'll come back.

Pomeroy said, ""Only tell me again your message was true. Tell me again he's gone, and where he's gone and what for. Tell me that's true."" The big man glowered and waited, and at Cutter's brief nod and closed eyes, he said, ""Well then.""

Others arrived then. First another woman, Ihona; and then as they welcomed her they heard stick-litter being destroyed in heavy leaps, and a vodyanoi came through the brush. He squatted in the froggish way of his race and raised webbed hands. When he jumped from the bank, his bodyhead and trunk all one fat sacrippled with impact. Fejhechrillen was besmirched and tired, his motion ill-suited to woodland.

They were anxious, not knowing how long they should wait, if any others would come. Cutter kept asking how they had heard his message. He made them unhappy. They did not want to consider their decision to join him: they knew there were many who would think it a betrayal.

""He'll be grateful,"" Cutter said. ""He's a funny bugger and might be he'll not show it, but this'll mean a lot, to me and to him.""

After silence Elsie said: ""You don't know that. He didn't ask us, Cutter. He just got some message, you said. He might be angry that we've come.""

Cutter could not tell her she was wrong. Instead he said: ""I don't see you leaving, though. We're here for us, maybe, as well as for him.""

He began to tell them what might be ahead, emphasising dangers. It seemed as if he wanted to dissuade them though they knew he did not. Drey argued with him in a rapid and nervy voice. He assured Cutter they understood. Cutter saw him persuading himself, and was silent. Drey said repeatedly that his mind was made up.

""We best move,"" said Elsie, when noon went. ""We can't wait forever. Anyone else is coming, they've obviously got lost. They'll have to go back to the Caucus, do what's needed in the city."" Someone gave a little cry and the company turned.

At the hollow's edge a hotchi rider was watching them, astride his gallus. The big war-cockerel plumped its breastfeathers and raised one spurred claw-foot in curious pose. The hotchi, squat and tough hedgehog man, stroked his mount's red comb.

""Militia coming."" His accent was strong and snarling. ""Two men militia coming, a minute, two."" He sat forward in the ornate saddle and turned his bird around. With very little sound, with no metal to jangle on wood-and-leather straps and stirrups, it picked away high-clawed and belligerent, and was hidden by the forest.

""Was that?"" ""What?"" ""Did you fucking?""

But Cutter and his companions were shushed by the sound of approach. They looked in unsaid panic, too late to hide.

Two men came stepping over fungused stumps into view. They were masked and uniformed in the militia's dark grey. Each had a mirrored shield and ungainly pepperpot revolver slack at his side. As they came into the clearing they faltered and were still, taking in the men and women waiting for them.

There was a dragged-out second when no one moved, when befuddled and silent conference was heldare you, are they, what, should we, should we?till someone shot. Then there were a spate of sounds, screams and the percussion of shots. People fell. Cutter could not follow who was where and was gut-terrified that he had been hit and not yet felt it. When the guns' heinous syncopation stopped, he unclenched his jaw.

Someone was calling Oh gods oh fucking gods. It was a militiaman, sitting bleeding from a belly-wound beside his dead friend and trying to hold his heavy pistol up. Cutter heard the curt torn-cloth sound of archery and the militia man lay back with an arrow in him and stopped his noise.

Again a beat of silence then ""Jabber"" ""Are you, is everyone?"" ""Drey? Pomeroy?""

First Cutter thought none of his own were hit. Then he saw how Drey was white and held his shoulder, and that blood dyed his palsying hands.

""Sweet Jabber, man."" Cutter made Drey sit (Is it all right? the little man kept saying.) Bullet had taken muscle. Cutter tore strips from Drey's shirt, and wound those cleanest around the hole. The pain made Drey fight, and Pomeroy and Fejh had to hold him. They gave him a thumb-thick branch to bite while they bandaged him.

""They must've fucking followed you, you halfwit bastards."" Cutter was raging while he worked. ""I told you to be fucking careful""

""We were,"" Pomeroy shouted, jabbing his finger at Cutter.

""Didn't follow them."" The hotchi reappeared, its rooster picking. ""Them patrol the pits. You been here long time, a day nearly."" It dismounted and walked the rim of the arena. ""You been too long.""

It showed the teeth in its snout in some opaque expression. Lower than Cutter's chest but rotundly muscular, it strutted like a bigger man. By the militia it stopped and sniffed. It sat up the one killed by its arrow and began to push the missile through the body.

""When them don't come back, them send more,"" it said. ""Them come after you. Maybe now."" It steered the arrow past bones through the dead chest. It gripped the shaft when it came out the corpse's back, and pulled the fletch through with a wet sound. The hotchi tucked it bloody into his belt, picked the revolving pistol from the militiaman's stiffening fingers and fired it against the hole.

Birds rose up again at the shot. The hotchi snarled with the unfamiliar recoil and shook its hand. The arrow's fingerthick burrow had become a cavity.

Pomeroy said: ""Godspit . . . who in hell are you?""

""Hotchi man. Cock-fighting man. Alectryomach. Help you.""

""Your tribe . . ."" said Cutter. ""They're with us? On our side? Some of the hotchi are with the Caucus,"" he said to the others. ""That's why this place's all right. Or was supposed to be. This lad's clan got no time for the militia. Give us passage. But . . . can't risk a real fight with the city, so they've to make it look like it was us killed the officers, not their arrows."" He understood as he said it.

Pomeroy and the hotchi rifled the killed men together. Pomeroy threw one of the pepperpot revolvers to Elsie, one to Cutter. It was modernistic and expensive and Cutter had never held one before. It was heavy, with its six barrels arranged in a fat rotating cylinder.

""They ain't reliable,"" said Pomeroy, harvesting bullets. ""Fast, though.""

""Jabber . . . we better fucking go."" Drey's voice went up and down with pain. ""Fucking guns going off going to call them for miles . . .""

""Not so many nearby,"" said the hotchi. ""Maybe none to hear. But you should gone, yes. What you for? Why leave city? You looking for him come by on the clay man?""

Cutter looked to the others and they watched him carefully, letting him speak.

He said: ""You seen him?"" He stepped toward the busy hotchi. ""You seen him?""

""Furo Wariboko awoke this morning to find that dreams can lose their way and turn up on the wrong side of sleep."" That's the first sentence of Blackass, the debut novel from Nigerian author A. Igoni Barrett, and if it sounds familiar, there's a good reason for that. The book is a long, bizarre riff on Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis, in which a salesman wakes up to find he's become an insect.

Furo's metamorphosis is markedly different: ""His hands were not black but white ... same as his legs, his belly, all of him."" His hair has become red; his eye color has changed to green. He's gone ""full oyibo,"" a Nigerian Pidgin word for a white person.

After realizing that he is not, in fact, dreaming, Furo panics. He has a job interview that he can't be late for, but he doesn't want his family to see how he's transformed. He's able to sneak out of the house that he shares with his parents and sister, and instantly draws stares as he walks to his prospective employer. ""Lone white face in a sea of black, Furo learned fast,"" Barrett writes. ""And he learnt how it felt to be seen as a freak: exposed to wonder, invisible to comprehension.""

Furo is shocked when he's instantly hired as a salesman for a book distributor. He encounters a woman named Syreeta, who lets him move in with her. And he befriends a writer named Igoni, who he meets in a shopping mall food court. Furo decides to embrace his new life as a white man (or mostly white  he learns, from Syreeta, that his buttocks have remained black). He changes his name to Frank Whyte, and throws himself into the bookselling business. He doesn't make contact with his family, who are trying desperately to find him.

It's obvious that Blackass is a satire; what's less clear is what exactly Barrett is satirizing. He does write beautifully, and sometimes humorously, on the topics of race and identity. Furo is initially homeless after he's hired at the company, and starts to question his previous assumptions: ""He had always thought that white people had it easier, in this country anyway, where it seemed that everyone treated them as special, but after everything that he had gone through since yesterday, he wasn't so sure any more.""

Barrett also has a lot to say about Nigeria, and the city of Lagos in particular, and these reflections are among the best parts of the book. ""Life in Lagos was locked in a constant struggle against empathy,"" he writes. ""Empathy was too much to ask for, too much to give: it was good only for beggars to exploit in their sob stories aimed at your pocket through your heart."" Barrett's depictions of Lagos are cutting, but also reluctantly admiring.

But the rest of Blackass gets mired down by the increasingly rambling plot. Furo's relationship with Syreeta is interesting, but Barrett's depiction of the young man's life at work is aimless and plodding; it almost feels like an afterthought.

It's obvious that 'Blackass' is a satire; what's less clear is what exactly Barrett is satirizing.

Perhaps the most bizarre sections of Blackass are the ones narrated by Igoni, who appears to be a fictional version of the author. (The character Igoni quotes lines from an interview he once gave, and they're nearly identical to ones from an interview Barrett did with Granta.) The character Igoni becomes obsessed with Furo's sister's Twitter account, and abruptly announces that he's transitioning to a woman. Neither of these things is ever really explained; they feel like another novel shoehorned into this one.

Barrett's writing is strong enough that it almost doesn't matter  it's an easy novel to read, very funny in places, and undoubtedly audacious. And he's capable of the kind of profundity that seems obvious, but really isn't: ""No one asks to be born, to be black or white or any colour in between, and yet the identity a person is born into becomes the hardest to explain to the world.""

It's a fascinating observation, and one that might explain why Blackass, though very good in parts, doesn't really work as a novel. Barrett definitely has great ideas and original observations, but it seems like he's tried too hard to force them all into one book. The result is a novel that's not unenjoyable, but one that never really comes together.",[]

The Dutch dentist was initially welcomed to the rural French town of Chateau-Chinon, which had been without a dental care provider for two years.

Then the horror stories started.

Now Jacobus Van Nierop is standing trial on charges of aggravated assault and insurance fraud, after scores of patients said he caused them injuries since arriving in town in 2008, Agence France-Presse reports. If found guilty, he could be sentenced to as many as 10 years in prison and fined up to $165,000, according to AFP.

The Associated Press has this account from a woman who said she was treated by the ""Dentist of Horror,"" as he has been dubbed in French media:

""One patient, Sylviane Boulesteix, has said she was unexpectedly summoned to the dental office in central-eastern France in May 2012. Without warning, the dentist pulled eight of her teeth out and immediately fixed dentures on her raw gums. For three hours, the elderly woman says she sat gushing blood. ""In the following days, she says Van Nierop refused to relieve her pain. A judicial expert later described a 'cruel and perverse' man whose incompetence made Boulesteix lose several healthy teeth, go through trauma and suffer irreversible damage to her mouth.""

According to AFP, some patients said they would wake to find notes asking them to come back for further treatment:

"" 'Every time, he would give us what he called 'a little prick' and we were asleep, knocked out,' said Nicole Martin, a retired teacher who lost several teeth to abscesses caused by the horrific operations. "" 'When it was over, we would find a Post-it note saying to come back for an appointment the next day or the day after,' she added.""

Martin set up a victims' group to press charges that grew to more than 120 members, according to AFP.

Van Nierop, 51, has said he ""suffers from 'psychological problems' including gender identity issues and suicidal tendencies,"" AFP reports.

He had a blanket over his head when he arrived today at the courthouse in the nearby city of Nevers, AFP reports. He has been incarcerated for the past 18 months.

""What my clients and I expect are explanations,"" Charles Joseph-Oudin, who is representing some of the victims, tells AFP. ""To understand how Mr. Van Nierop could have acted in such a way for so long, how things could have become so bad. Today, we have no explanations. Understanding is the first step of the victims' healing process.""

According to the AP, the defendant has ""refused to answer questions during the investigation, saying only that the oral health of the people in the region was 'deplorable.' ""

Van Nierop was arrested in 2013 but was released and then fled to Canada, AFP reports. He was found in New Brunswick in 2014, extradited to the Netherlands and then sent back to France to stand trial.

According to Vice, the Van Nierop case highlights the problem of France's 192 "" 'medical deserts'  areas where the authorities have failed to find successors for retiring doctors."" Vice says some 2.5 million people live in these areas.",[]

Videos and audio clips of someone being shot, a disaster victim crying for help, bodies being recovered and other potentially disturbing scenes present us with challenges.

When weighing whether to post such videos online and to use any clips on the air, keep in mind that:

 Conversations are required. The senior news manager on duty (a DME or the designated supervisor) must be consulted. The Visuals team should be pulled in. Other senior editors may be as well.

 The conversations start from this position: We report the news, good and bad.

 But we cant be callous. The video may show someones death. Out of respect for that person and that persons family, we consider carefully what should be shown or heard. Our general rule is that we do not post video or play audio of someones moment of death. There will be exceptions, but only after discussion.

 We also respect our audience. They want the facts. But for many, reading or hearing descriptions will be more than enough. Seeing or hearing disturbing events could leave them too shaken to follow the rest of a story.

 Every other news outlet else is using it is not on its own a justification for posting or broadcasting anything.

 Especially in the first minutes and hours after such content surfaces, its credibility may be in doubt. Proceed with caution.

 The content may be propaganda. For example, extremist groups spread their messages and try to spread terror by putting out videos of hostages being murdered. We do not blindly post or air propaganda. It would be highly unusual for us to even link to it.

Rigid rules about what to do wont work. Each situation is different. However:

 If its decided that videos with potentially disturbing content can be posted, they should never start automatically when a webpage loads. They must require a click to begin. They must either have a warning note embedded in them or it must appear directly above them.

 Likewise, on the air listeners should never hear potentially disturbing content without first being told that its coming. For instance, cellphone audio of gunshots that kill a man should not be heard until after a caution has been given.

 We should consider whether a videos disturbing moments and sounds can and should be blurred and bleeped, for posting online and using on the air.

 If the original content is too disturbing to post and we do not have a blurred/bleeped version that we are comfortable using, we may decide to link to another news outlets edited version if it is in line with our standards. We should caution readers that it includes potentially disturbing content. The language should be simple and clear. For example: The Daily Planet has posted a clip from the video here. Reminder: It is graphic.

 When a member station is chasing the same story, we should talk with the news director about how to handle the content. Often, well be in agreement and can link to the stations coverage.

But, But, But:

 Does this mean well never put such content online or on the air?

No. See above: We report the news, good and bad. We would not have edited a video of the Challenger explosion, for example, to blur the key moments.

 Are we treating the audience like children?

Some will say we are. We believe were making editorial judgments.

Note: The guidance above applies to images as well. We do not post potentially disturbing photos without first discussing.

For several decades, the band has innovated within itself and outside of extreme metal, culminating in last year's sonically wide-ranging Apex Predator  Easy Meat. ""Dear Slum Landlord"" was one of that album's most fascinating tracks, a dirge that oozes contempt for authority in eerily melodic riffs and Mark ""Barney"" Greenway's moans, which turn into a fierce bark.

A new video depicts evil slumlords in stark, black-and-white drawings that capture the way the public is devoured. Greenway writes NPR via email:

Being that this is a very queasy and deliberately monotone kind of song, we felt simplicity was the key with the video for ""Dear Slum Landlord."" Suitably, thanks to two production people in Oliver and Costin  who really understand the contrasting elements of Napalm Death  it's simple, desolate, black-and-white and just that little bit grim, befitting the subject matter of interconnected housing/labour exploitation which does its best to remain hidden from view.

More On The Album For more on the making of this album, including alternate takes, outtakes and stories behind the songs, visit the band's Tumblr page.

""I had a dream where you were standing there with a gun up to my head."" This is how Lucius drops us, in medias res, into ""Madness,"" the evocative first song on the band's second album, Good Grief. What unfolds is a lucid dream-chase sequence that captures a desire to pull the escape hatch and go on wild adventures full of danger and doomed affairs: ""Maybe I'll drive myself to madness / Spinning in circles, don't have it figured out just yet,"" Lucius' Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig sing in unison.

The two instantly won over fans with their gorgeous, joyful songs, not to mention their matching retro outfits and mod mirror-image haircuts  an eye-catching calling card that symbolizes the musical unity between Laessig and Wolfe and their bandmates, multi-instrumentalists Andrew Burri, Peter Lalish and Dan Molad. But as the group pushes its guitar-driven, folk-infused pop toward a broader, more sparkling palette, the blustery ballad provides a dramatic reintroduction.

Good Grief was written and recorded after two years on the road in support of 2013's fantastic Wildewoman  a period that saw the band blow up from Brooklyn favorite to an act capable of packing spacious music clubs, becoming a staple at summer festivals, and performing alongside musicians like Mavis Staples and Wilco's Jeff Tweedy. Produced with Shawn Everett and Bob Ezrin, Good Grief is invigorated by glitzy production that brims with sounds: pulsing analog keyboards (""Something About You""), trilling guitar lines (""Almighty Gosh"") and big '80s disco beats (""Almost Makes Me Wish For Rain""), all tailored to fill those sprawling venues. Nearly every song peaks with epic singalong choruses, led by Laessig and Wolfe as they belt their hearts out.

As rapturous as Good Grief feels in its catchiest moments, it's all in service to songs that touch on the dueling bittersweet experiences of love. Throughout the album, Lucius offers up intimate snapshots in the arc of a romance  from early excitement (""Born Again Teen"") to stormy fights and the lonely aftermath of ""My Heart Got Caught On Your Sleeve,"" wherein they lament, ""Smoked another cigarette, 'cause even though I quit / I'd do about just anything to pacify my own torment."" ""What We Have (To Change)"" begins simply with a stark piano and stirring close harmony, as they mull over the great lengths they'd go to rekindle a neglected relationship: ""Find me a mountain or any grand canyons / Just find us an igloo and I'll freeze with you,"" they offer in swooning unison.

The album reaches a climactic highlight in ""Gone Insane,"" which alludes to one of those all-too-real arguments where things cannot be unsaid.

i Matailong Du/NPR Matailong Du/NPR

In 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, by a vote of 8 to 1, to uphold a state's right to forcibly sterilize a person considered unfit to procreate. The case, known as Buck v. Bell, centered on a young woman named Carrie Buck, whom the state of Virginia had deemed to be ""feebleminded.""

Author Adam Cohen tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that Buck v. Bell was considered a victory for America's eugenics movement, an early 20th century school of thought that emphasized biological determinism and actively sought to ""breed out"" traits that were considered undesirable.

""There were all kinds of categories of people who were deemed to be unfit [to procreate],"" Cohen says. ""The eugenicists looked at evolution and survival of the fittest, as Darwin was describing it, and they believed 'We can help nature along, if we just plan who reproduces and who doesn't reproduce.' ""

All told, as many as 70,000 Americans were forcibly sterilized during the 20th century. The victims of state-mandated sterilization included people like Buck who had been labeled ""mentally deficient,"" as well as those who who were deaf, blind and diseased. Minorities, poor people and ""promiscuous"" women were often targeted.

Cohen's new book about the Buck case, Imbeciles, takes its name from the terms eugenicists used to categorize the ""feebleminded."" In it, he revisits the Buck v. Bell ruling and explores the connection between the American eugenics movement and the rise of the Nazi party in Germany.

Cohen notes that the instinct to ""demonize"" people who are different is still prevalent in the U.S. today, particularly in the debate over immigration.

""I think these instincts to say that we need to stop these other people from 'polluting us,' from changing the nature of our country, they're very real,"" Cohen warns. ""The idea that those who don't remember the past are condemned to repeat it  it's very troubling that we don't remember this past.""

Interview Highlights

On the case of Carrie Buck

This is this poor young woman, really nothing wrong with her physically or mentally, a victim of a terrible sexual assault, and there's a little hearing, she's declared feebleminded and she gets sent off to the colony for epileptics and feebleminded. ...

Imbeciles The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck by Adam Cohen Hardcover, 402 pages | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

When she's at the colony, the guy who is running the colony, Dr. Albert Priddy, is on the prowl. He's looking for someone to put at the center of this test case that they want to bring, so he's looking for someone to sterilize, and he sees Carrie Buck when she comes in, he does the examination himself, and there are a lot of things about her that excite him. She is deemed to be feebleminded, she has a mother who is feebleminded, so that's good because you can show some genetics, and then they're hoping that [her] baby could be determined to be feebleminded too, then you could really show a genetic pattern of feeblemindedness. The fact that she had been pregnant out of wedlock was another strike against her. So he fixes on her and thinks Carrie Buck is going to be the perfect potential plaintiff. ...

He chooses her, and then under the Virginia law, they have to have a sterilization hearing at the colony, which they do and they give her a lawyer (who is really not a lawyer for her; it's really someone who had been the chairman of the board of the colony and was sympathetic to the colony's side) and they have a bit of a sham hearing where she is determined to be a suitable person for sterilization; they vote to sterilize her, and that is the order that then gets challenged by Carrie as the plaintiff first in the Virginia court system and then in the Supreme Court.

On why he considers Buck v. Bell to be one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in American history

If you start by just looking at all the human misery that was inflicted, about 70,000 Americans were sterilized as a result of this decision, so that's an awful lot of people who wanted to have children who weren't able to have children. Also, we have to factor in all the many people who were being segregated, who were being held in these institutions for eugenic reasons, because they were feebleminded, whose lives unfolded living in places like the colony, rather than living in freedom. Beyond the human effect though, there was something just so ugly about this decision and when [we] think about what we want the Supreme Court to be, what the founders wanted the Supreme Court to be, it was supposed to be our temple of justice, the place that people could go when all the other parts of our society, all the other parts of the government, were not treating them right.

On how eugenicists sought to address the ""threat"" to the gene pool

The eugenicists saw two threats to the national gene pool: One was the external one, which they were addressing through immigration law; the other was the internal one  what to do about the people who were already here. They had a few ideas.

The first eugenics law in the United States was passed in Connecticut in 1895, and it was a law against certain kinds of marriages. They were trying to stop certain unfit people from reproducing through marriage. It wasn't really what they wanted, though, because they realized that people would just reproduce outside of marriage.

So their next idea was what they called segregation. The idea was to get people who were deemed unfit institutionalized during their reproductive years, particularly for women, keep them there, make sure they didn't reproduce, and then women were often let go when they had passed their reproductive years because they were no longer a threat to the gene pool. That had a problem too, though. The problem was that it would be really expensive to segregate, institutionalize the number of people the eugenicists were worried about. ...

Their next idea was eugenic sterilization and that allowed for a model in which they would take people in to institutions, eugenically sterilize them, and then they could let them go, because they were no longer a threat. That's why eugenic sterilization really became the main model that the eugenicists embraced and that many states enacted laws to allow.

On deeming people ""feebleminded""

""Feebleminded"" was really the craze in American eugenics. There was this idea that we were being drowned in a tide of feeblemindedness  that basically unintelligent people were taking over, reproducing more quickly than the intelligent people  but it was also a very malleable term that was used to define large categories of people that again, were disliked by someone who was in the decision-making position. So, women who were thought to be overly interested in sex, licentious, were sometimes deemed feebleminded. It was a broad category and it was very hard to prove at one of these feeblemindedness hearings that you were not feebleminded.

On the involuntary sterilization procedure

For men it was something like a vasectomy. For women it was a salpingectomy, where they cauterized the path that the egg takes toward fertilization. It was, in the case of women, not minor surgery and when you read about what happened, it's many, many days of recovery and it had certain dangers attached to it, and a lot of the science was still quite new. ...

When you add onto all that, the fact that in many, many cases the women involved were not told what was being done to them, they might be told that they were having an appendectomy, they weren't being told that the government has decided that you are unfit to reproduce and we're then going to have surgery on you, so that just compounds the horror of the situation.

On how the Nazis borrowed from the U.S. eugenics sterilization program

We really were on the cutting edge. We were doing a lot of this in the 1910s and 1920s. Indiana adopted a eugenic sterilization law, America's first in 1907. We were writing the eugenics sterilization statutes that decided who should be sterilized. We also had people who were writing a lot of what might be thought of as pro-Aryan theory. So you have people like Madison Grant who wrote a very popular book called The Passing of a Great Race, which really talked about the superiority of Nordics, as he called them, and how they were endangered by all the brown people and the non-Nordics who were taking over.

On a 1924 immigration law, which was inspired by eugenicists, that prevented Anne Frank's family from entering the U.S.

Under the old immigration laws where it was pretty much ""show up,"" they would've been able to emigrate, but suddenly they were trapped by very unfavorable national quotas, so this really was a reason that so many Jews were turned away.

One very poignant aspect of it that I've thought about as I was working on the book is in the late '90s some correspondence appeared, was uncovered, in which Otto Frank was writing repeatedly to the State Department begging for visas for himself and his wife and his two daughters, Margot and Anne, and was turned down, and that was because there were now these quotas in place. If they had not been, it seems clear that he would've been able to get a visa for his whole family, including his daughter Anne Frank.

So when we think about the fact that Anne Frank died in a concentration camp, we're often told that it was because the Nazis believed the Jews were genetically inferior, that they were lesser than Aryans. That's true, but to some extent Anne Frank died in a concentration camp because the U.S. Congress believed that as well.",[]

toggle caption Xinhua News Agency

It took Abdul Arian months to realize that his decision to migrate from his home country, Afghanistan, to Germany was a huge mistake.

He set off nearly a year ago, hoping to be granted asylum so that he could go to university and study psychology.

His journey, organized by smugglers, was long and perilous. Arian, 24, says he nearly drowned off the shores of Greece, when the inflatable dinghy he was traveling in capsized.

He says he and his fellow travelers got lost somewhere in Hungary and walked through the rain for 24 hours before they found the path again.

Yet the reason that Arian finally saw his mistake was not because something nasty or dangerous happened to him. It was because nothing really happened at all.

When Arian arrived in Germany, he was placed in a migrants' reception center.

""We had nothing to do in the camp,"" he says. ""We just stayed there.""

He played a lot of soccer. He ate a lot of jelly sandwiches. He moped about. Officials wrote down his name. In the end, he says, he was in Germany for 10 months, yet ""no one asked me why I went there and why I was there."" No one seemed to want to listen to him explain why he should be allowed to stay.

It also soon became clear to Arian that local Germans did not appreciate his presence. While people from the church and social workers helped the migrants and were ""very nice,"" residents of the nearby village seemed hostile.

""When we were walking along the sidewalk, people would avoid us,"" says Arian.

Germany Says Many Must Leave

Last year, 150,000 Afghans arrived in Germany. The German authorities estimate less that half qualify for asylum.

German officials say at present a tiny number of Afghans  1,600, according to estimates given to them by Afghan officials in Germany  are willing to go back home voluntarily.

But many will have to leave, says Germany's ambassador to Afghanistan, Markus Potzel.

""It means that more than half of them have to be sent back because they can't stay,"" says Potzel. ""There are some obstacles for them to be sent back immediately, but we have a huge number of Afghans who are not eligible to stay in Germany and should be sent back.""

During Arian's time in Germany, he began to notice that Syrian migrants were being treated very differently. They were provided with language lessons and eventually passports, he says.

""When we complained to the social workers, they responded frankly. They said, 'We've invited Syrians here, not Afghans,' "" he says.

This prompted some of Arian's fellow Afghans to stage demonstrations.

""They were shouting, 'We don't want to go back to Afghanistan! There is a war there!' "" he says. ""But no one listened to them.""

The weeks rolled by. Arian was moved to another center. But still nothing happened. He grew steadily more convinced that he had no chance of being allowed to stay in Germany. Then depression set in.

""I was in very bad condition. I couldn't sleep. I decided to go back to Afghanistan, before I went crazy,"" he says.

Arian returned home last month. He was one of 125 Afghans sent back to Afghanistan on a charter flight organized by the German and Afghan governments. The passengers all signed a form saying they were returning voluntarily.

Arian's family spent most of their savings on his trip to Germany. To pay the smuggler's bill of $7,500, they sold land and a car. Arian is now worrying about what his family feels about that.

""So far, I haven't seen any reaction from them because I've just arrived back. But I don't know what's in their hearts,"" he says.

Arian is faced with finding work amid rampant unemployment in a society where good jobs are very hard to find without political or personal connections  or cash for a hefty bribe.

Humiliation For Some

That much is clear from the experience of Shirdil Bayat, 40. He was deported from Denmark two years ago, after a court rejected his request for asylum  which he'd based on a claim that his life was threatened by the Taliban in his home city, Kandahar.

Lacking personal connections, Bayat took 16 months to find permanent work as an office cleaner in the capital, Kabul. He says returning home to Kandahar is still too risky. On a recent day when he was interviewed by NPR, he'd been laid off because of budget cuts. He says he has no idea what he'll do next.

Bayat says returning to Afghanistan after having failed in Europe can be very humiliating. Some families are sympathetic, but far from all.

""People jeer at you. They ask, 'Why did so-and-so get citizenship in Europe while you did not? Maybe you're useless,' "" he says.

The Germans are running a PR campaign in Afghanistan, trying to deter Afghans from traveling to their land. They've posted announcements on billboards, buses and the Internet, urging Afghans to think twice before setting off.

Germany views many of the Afghans who've arrived on its soil as economic migrants seeking jobs or education.

German officials maintain that under international law, Germany is not required to grant asylum to those migrants  unlike Syrians, who are fleeing a war zone.

The United Nations estimates that last year, some 11,000 civilians were killed or injured by conflict in Afghanistan. Afghans say that bolsters proof that there is war in Afghanistan, too  and that Afghans should therefore be granted protection by European nations.

""Afghans are not leaving Afghanistan because of a lack of jobs, "" says Ashraf Haidari, director-general of policy and strategy at Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry. ""They are fleeing generalized violence. Terrorism that is killing men, women and children,"" he says. ""That - and political uncertainty as a result of withdrawal of international forces and diminishing international development aid.""

Germany Draws A Distinction

However, Potzel, Germany's ambassador, says the situation in Afghanistan differs hugely from Syria's.

""Here in Afghanistan, you don't have a government who would bomb their own population,"" he says. ""Here, the government tries to protect their own people. There are unsafe regions and there are less unsafe regions in Afghanistan, and there are regions  especially in the big cities  where a sort of normal life is going on.""

Germany is one of the main international donors to Afghanistan. Over the last 14 years, it has poured a great deal of money into the country. It seems unlikely that it would wish to risk making Afghanistan still more unstable by forcibly returning large numbers of Afghans over a short time span.

Yet there is considerable concern in Afghanistan about what might happen if significant numbers of angry and disillusioned young Afghans are eventually sent back from Europe.

Some European countries provide financial support packages to help people settle in, but the sums are generally small and over a limited time period.

Professor Sayed Masoud, an economist based in Kabul, foresees ""disaster.""

""Either they will join the Taliban or become drug addicts,"" he says, ""because the government can't provide jobs.""

Meanwhile, Afghans keep heading on the trail to Europe. On a recent early morning in Kabul, hundreds of men were lined up outside the government office that issues passports.

Among them was Wahidullah Mohammadi, 19, who wants to migrate to Europe to go to school. He is aware of the risk of being deported back home  and of losing the thousands of dollars he'll pay to smugglers.

Still, he still thinks the odds are worth it.

""The situation is not good here and there is no guaranteed future,"" he says. ""This is why I have to accept this risk.""",[]

It's a gift idea for all your friends and loved ones who want, let's say, a cumbersome, frustrating, time-consuming present this holiday season, one that can take up an entire room.

ADRIAN CHESTERMAN: Yeah. It's massive.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

We're talking about a puzzle, a 33,600-piece jigsaw puzzle. It's 18 feet long, 5 feet wide and weighs more than 35 pounds.

CORNISH: Yikes.

SHAPIRO: The image on it is a fantasy forest with every imaginable animal. It's called ""Wilderness.""

CORNISH: ""Wilderness"" is the creation of Adrian Chesterton (sic). He's an artist living in Spain. He says he's done lots of other puzzles.

CHESTERMAN: But I've never done one this big. They're usually about a thousand-piece, 1,500 pieces. But (laughter) obviously, 33,600 is kind of an exception.

CORNISH: Chesterton (sic) says this enormous jigsaw puzzle is just the latest volley in an ever-escalating battle.

CHESTERMAN: There's a company in Germany called Ravensburger, and the company I did this for is Spanish, called Educa Borras. And Educa Borras and Ravensburger have been competing to who has the biggest jigsaw puzzle in the world for the last 10 years. So one produced one of at 8,000, and then the other produced one at 10 and then at 12. And it leapt to 16, and then it went to 18 and then 24. This is like a game of tennis. And the last one was Ravensburger - did a 25,000-pieces puzzle.

SHAPIRO: Adrian Chesterton (sic) would like his town to sponsor an event for charity and get schoolchildren to complete this monstrous puzzle. And then he wants the competition to make an ever-bigger puzzle to end.

CHESTERMAN: I mean. it's getting so silly. You'd need a house the size - I mean, you'd have to be the queen of England or - I don't know - live in a house the size of the White House.

CORNISH: That's Adrian Chesterton (sic). His artwork is featured on the world's largest jigsaw puzzle. It's called ""Wilderness."" And by the way, he hasn't assembled it himself because he's too busy. He told us the most recent jigsaw puzzle he solved had just 12 pieces.

There were incidents at high school basketball games where fans chanted ""build a wall"" at teams made up of minority students. David Greene talks to Washington Post sports columnist Kevin Blackistone.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

There was a basketball game last month near Gary, Ind. Two Catholic high schools were playing, and some students began to chant, Trump, Trump, and build a wall. They were chanting at the rival team which was mostly Hispanic. There was a similar incident in Iowa not long before that - also a high school basketball game, also involving a team made up of minority players. In both cases, school and community leaders quickly denounced the incidents, but we've been wondering what those incidents tell us about the campaign and maybe the country. Kevin Blackistone, sports columnist at The Washington Post and journalism professor at the University of Maryland is on the line via Skype.

Kevin, good morning. Welcome back to the program.

KEVIN BLACKISTONE: Thank you David. How're you doing?

GREENE: I'm well, thank you. What did you make of those basketball games?

BLACKISTONE: Well, it's very disturbing. You know, time has shown that generally it is sports language and discourse that kind of seeps into our political discussions.

GREENE: Like using a term like, Hail Mary, or something like that.

BLACKISTONE: Exactly. And this time, we happened to see it the other way around, which tells me a couple of things. One, that the course - discourse of this political season has really reached deep into the fabric of our society when kids at a high school game have picked up upon it. And also, it's disturbing that they would pick up on the absolute worst part of this discourse and turn it into verbal weaponry against kids of color. That's very, very disturbing.

GREENE: And I guess it's really important to point out - I mean, this is obviously not something that Donald Trump or his campaign would have been responsible for, these are people just using his name in an environment like this. I guess I'm just so struck because not so, so long ago - I mean, I was going to my high school basketball games. I don't remember talking about politics or using campaign slogans or names of candidates at all.

BLACKISTONE: No, and it may be a reflection of social media, or it may be a reflection of the way that we've - we in the media have come to cover this political campaign. It has been 24-7 on any number of networks. It has seeped into late-night television as entertainment. It is everywhere. On the one hand, I would embrace this if in fact this means that teenagers who soon will be of voting age have become very, very interested in our political process, but on the other hand, I'm just very, very disturbed about the part of the campaign that they've picked up. And, you know, if you look to Europe or even South America to see how sports and politics have oftentimes been married into the hooliganism that you see in soccer that oftentimes has been organized around fascist politics...

GREENE: You're talking about some of the violent riots we've seen, like, at soccer games and so forth in Europe and South America.

BLACKISTONE: Exactly. And particularly, we saw it back in Yugoslavia when it was disintegrating in the early 1990s. I don't want to elevate high school - what I'd like to dismiss as high school pranks - to that level, but nonetheless, if you see it in high school sports, where will you see it next in our sporting landscape?

GREENE: All right. We'll have to stop there.

Kevin, thanks so much for joining us, as always.

BLACKISTONE: Thanks for the invite.

Most people remember the first time they fall in love. In this excerpt from ""Modern Love: The Podcast,"" the author writes about the actual fall that marked her first love.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Now for a story about falling in love, and not just figuratively. In 2012, Natalie Lindeman went on a first date and she fell a hundred feet down a mountainside into a canyon. Lindeman wrote about her date, that fall and what happened next in an essay for the popular New York Times Sunday column ""Modern Love."" Now, NPR member station WBUR and The New York Times have collaborated to produce ""Modern Love: The Podcast,"" which turns those columns into an experience for the ear.

Here, actor Dakota Fanning reads Natalie Lindeman's essay, ""The Plunge.""

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DAKOTA FANNING: (Reading) Last summer, I fell 100 feet into one of the steepest canyons in the United States. After tumbling 75 feet down the near-vertical canyon side, I dropped another 25 feet in freefall, landing in a dry stream bed between granite boulders.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) I have always loved falling. When I was 3, my favorite game was mantle jumping. My dad would place me on the mantle, steady me and step back. I'd push off and fall for that perfect rush of a second before he caught me, swinging me to the ground. In high school, I found a teenage version of mantle jumping by leaping off high, rocky cliffs with my friends into the ocean below. I loved the way the wind whistled in my ears, making me feel so alive. Yet if I was passionate about adventure, I was cautious about passion. A boyfriend would only slow me down.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) Then near the end of my junior year of high school, a senior named Wilder asked me to prom, and I said yes. Right after I said yes though, my heart started pounding and I raced into an empty classroom to breathe for a minute alone. The smile on my face was so big it hurt. I was determined to keep things casual as we headed out on our first real date.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) To escape the early summer heat, we decided to hike the sage-lined trail to the waterfall in Eaton Canyon. Dozens of hikers were already splashing in the pool when college-age hiker asked if we had heard of the second waterfall only a mile beyond. Although the path was unmarked, we tramped another 20 minutes up the steep incline and found it, beautiful and isolated. It was so easy to be with him. We were coming around a curve in the canyon wall, hurrying to get back while it was still light. Wilder went first, searching for notches and footholds, finally making it around. Then I went, feeling for handholds, my face inches from the rock. I traced to where he had grasped, reaching back with my left foot, searching for the ledge. And suddenly, I wasn't holding onto anything. Sandy grit was skittering down the mountain alongside me. I was falling.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) I woke up to the sound of helicopter blades. A cable carried me into the air. It struck me; I had just fallen, and now they were taking me up even higher. My dad found me in the too-bright emergency room and tried to hold my hands, but they were a bloody mess like the rest of me. Wilder's in the waiting room, he said. Nurses cut away my clothes with giant scissors and wiped the dirt and blood from my body. I heard scattered phrases - 100 feet, fractured vertebrae, a miracle. Wilder visited as soon as he was allowed. You're off the hook, I said. What do you mean, he asked? I explained in my drugged speech that he didn't have to come to the hospital or hang out with a broken girl all summer. No guilt. I'd call him when I was healed and back to normal. He stayed with me until a nurse kicked him out.

Five days later, I was home. Doctors said I would have to wear a corset-like brace from my hips to my neck for eight to 12 weeks, and then we could talk about recuperation. Sitting up for 20 minutes exhausted me, and I could barely move without wincing in pain.

Wilder kept visiting, and it scared the hell out of me. I fought to look like the girl he had asked to prom. I looked as if I had been mauled by a tiger, but the brace covered most of it. I'd laugh, roll out of bed and walk around as if keeping in constant motion would prove I was strong, independent and unhurt. I figured he'd leave while I slept, but I'd doze off listening to him playing basketball with my little brother and when I'd wake up, he'd be eating dinner with my family.

Sometimes I think my body saved itself that day by learning to surrender, that those years of falling prepared me to relax into the 100-foot plunge. But it was weeks after the fall before I could truly let go. I thought I could use my injuries as an excuse to push Wilder away. I thought I could forget the look on his face as I fell and ignore the terrified feeling of longing in my chest. But I couldn't. Maybe it was the way he said, I'd rather spend my summer with you than any other girl. Maybe it was how being around him made me forget the brace and the wounds, made me feel whole and unbroken. Finally, surrender became not just inevitable but exhilarating. I didn't want to hold onto anything anymore. I wanted to fall, and I already had. And I knew that this time, too, I would be OK.

MARTIN: That was Dakota Fanning reading Natalie Lindeman's essay, ""The Plunge,"" for WBUR and The New York Times's ""Modern Love: The Podcast.""

Appearing at a Cruz rally in Miami on Wednesday morning, Fiorina said she voted for Cruz in Virginia's recent primary, and praised his record in challenging Washington's status quo.

Calling Cruz a ""real constitutional conservative,"" she said ""he is a fearless fighter and reformer, and he didn't care much whether he got invited to the cocktail parties in Washington, D.C."" Fiorina said.

npr.org,,"On Why Its Not OK To Ask Friends, Family Or Fixers To Take Photos For Us",[],"On Why Its Not OK To Ask Friends, Family Or Fixers To Take Photos For Us

Heres what everyone needs to know: When on assignment, do not turn to friends, family members, freelance producers or foreign fixers and ask them to take a picture to go with the digital version of your story.

This has been happening in recent months and as the Visuals team notes, its a problem. Among the issues:

 In most cases, the people being asked to take photographs are not trained journalists, so NPR may not be able to vouch for the journalistic integrity of their image-making.

 In some cases, the person whos been asked to take a photo is being employed by NPR to do a very specific job. Because the photo-making is not negotiated ahead of time, its asking someone to do more work than theyve signed on to do.

 Why not just pay them another $50? Well, the budget for photos is limited, so Visuals must carefully weigh whether to hire a photographer to cover any particular story. If the budget gets drained by ad hoc arrangements, we may not be able to hire professionals for other stories.

 Whats wrong with having your son or daughter come along to take photos? Asking minors to work for us raises child labor issues, liability issues and ethical issues.

We understand that it can be hard to collect tape and make images and do everything else that goes into being a multi-platform journalist. Heres what the Visuals team asks:

If reporters think they wont be able to handle gathering images in the field on their own, they and their editors should come to us and well figure out a solution. If a story warrants original imagery, that decision and hire should be made by a photo editor on the Visuals team.

Meanwhile, everyone should be on notice that photos taken by my friend Buzz or my nephew whos really good with a camera will be turned down for one or more of the reasons above.

Bottom line: Its important to remember that all assets for stories gathered in the field should be collected by NPR journalists, or NPR-commissioned journalists. The images that go with our reports are important. Think about it this way: Would you hand a microphone to that precocious niece of yours and have her do some interviews?

npr.org,,Guidance: On Station Reporters & News About Their Universities Or Institutions,[],"Guidance: On Station Reporters & News About Their Universities Or Institutions

When there is news involving the university or institution that holds an NPR member stations license, conflicts of interest  perceived and actual  must be considered. So NPR editors ask questions:

 Is it a breaking news situation in which a station reporter could be our eyes on the ground and voice from the scene? Also is it a story that is about an event more than the institution? In recent years, this has happened most often when an institution is on lock-down because of a shooting or reports of a shooter. We would likely want to hear from a station reporter in our Newscasts and on our news magazines about what is happening.

 Is it a story that involves the institution but is not really about the institution? A recent example was the death of North Carolina basketball coach Dean Smith. We felt it would not be a problem for a station reporter to file an obit-type report for us. Yes, Smith was a towering figure at the university. But he was not controversial in the way that Joe Paterno, for example, became at Penn State. There wasnt anything about his time at UNC that we felt would give the appearance of a conflict if a station reporter was on our air. Bottom line: the news was about Smith, not the school.

 Is it a story about that institution? In such cases, we consider very carefully whether it would look like there was a conflict of interest if a station reporter files for us. We err on the side of caution. We know that listeners/readers may rightfully question whether a reporter who is paid by an institution should report about it. For example, if a schools football coach was under fire for putting a football player back on the field too soon after a concussion  leading to calls for the coachs firing and questions about the universitys response  that is a story we would not want to take from a station reporter at the school. The Penn State/Jerry Sandusky story was another that we felt should not be covered, on our airwaves, by a reporter from the schools station.

 Has the nature of a story shifted? Heres an example: While a station reporter is likely the logical person to use in the first hours after a campus shooting, that reporter and his/her station probably are not the right person or place to turn if questions start to come up about the universitys response to the incident.

We cant anticipate every possibility. The discussion above is designed to offer general guidelines and recent examples of how things have been handled. Situations will be considered case-by-case.

These things dont change from story to story: We value and need the solid reporting that member stations provide. We start with the assumption that we want to use their reports. Sometimes we may need to say no. But at all times we want to talk through the issues.

We have worked with some station-based news directors and PRNDI on the guidelines above; we welcome more feedback about our thinking and this guidance.

i toggle caption Dieter Endlicher/AP Dieter Endlicher/AP

Nancy Reagan, the influential and stylish former first lady who died on Sunday at 94, was fond of saying: ""A woman is like a tea bag. You never know how strong it is until it's in hot water.""

Reagan was merely quoting a line attributed to another first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt (though historians have never confirmed whether Roosevelt said it).

Reagan got a chance to test that quip at the 1985 Geneva Summit, when she met the first lady of the Soviet Union, Raisa Gorbachev, over tea, at two tensely choreographed tete-a-tetes.

While their husbands discussed nuclear disarmament  this meeting was the first step in a historical detente that would end with the fall of the Wall  the two wives chatted over tea.

The press hyped the tea parties as the ""Tea Summit."" After all, Gorbachev, a political science lecturer, was called ""the Kremlin's secret weapon,"" and everyone knew that Reagan was not only her husband's most trusted adviser, but that it was she who had encouraged him to talk to the Russians.

Reagan played host first, inviting Gorbachev to tea at the beautiful lakeside mansion loaned to the Reagans by the Aga Khan. Things didn't start well. Gorbachev's long motorcade rolled up 15 minutes late, a tardiness bitterly noted by the waiting journalists whiplashed by the icy November winds.

Matters scarcely improved inside when Gorbachev began to behave like the Red Queen from Alice in Wonderland. ""When she didn't like the chair she was seated in, she snapped her fingers to summon her KGB guards, who promptly moved her to another chair,"" recounted a startled Reagan in her memoirs, My Turn. ""After sitting in the new spot for a couple of minutes, she decided she didn't like that one either, so she snapped her fingers and they moved her again."" But since the imperious behavior was not repeated, Reagan correctly chalked it up to nerves.

""I offered Raisa a choice of coffee or decaffeinated almond tea, my personal favorite,"" wrote Reagan. ""She chose the tea and seemed to enjoy it.""

Surprisingly, given the strained atmosphere, the visit lasted more than an hour, but neither the freshly baked cookies nor the crackling fire could rescue the ""dry, impersonal and tedious"" conversation.

""She was lecturing me about Communism, and I couldn't wait for her to stop,"" recalls an exasperated Reagan.

Although Reagan tried to make out that it had all gone marvelously, telling the press that her guest had ""talked a lot about Russia and the expanse of Russia, and the different sections and climates of Russia,"" her irritation was apparent. ""I discussed my children,"" she said. ""We didn't get around to her children, maybe tomorrow.""

At 4 p.m. sharp the next afternoon, Reagan arrived at the Soviet Mission, a boxy, officelike building. She was surprised to see the glamorous ""Bo Derek of the Steppes,"" as the press called Gorbachev, dressed ""like a prison matron"" in a black skirt, a white shirt and a black tie. Soon enough she understood why: ""They were taking the only photograph of her at the Geneva Summit that would be shown back home.""

Gorbachev was still smarting from the criticism she had received from the Soviet press about her recent visit to Paris, where she had hobnobbed with the bourgeois capitalist designers Pierre Cardin and Yves Saint Laurent. It had earned her the catty epithet of ""Gucci comrade""  something she was determined to avoid this time.

But though both the U.S. and USSR assiduously projected the first ladies' teas as serious business devoted to promoting peace, the press continued to compare Reagan's sheer stockings with Gorbachev's opaque ones.

The Russian tea came with an hors de 'oeuvre of propaganda. After being dragged through children's drawings decorating the hall, with her host providing a granular commentary on each sketch, Reagan felt ""condescended to.""

""I wanted to say, 'Enough. You don't have to tell me what a missile is. I get the message.' ""

She brightened, however, at the sight of the sumptuous spread laid out for her. ""On the table was a lovely antique samovar, and next to it was a mouth-watering array of delicacies: blinis with caviar, cabbage rolls, blueberry pie, cookies, chocolates, honey and jam. I couldn't possibly try everything, and I finally had to give up.""

Gorbachev called it ""a typical Russian tea,"" provoking a sarcastic riposte in Reagan's memoirs: ""If that was an ordinary housewife's tea, then I'm Catherine the Great.""

Both women were no doubt relieved when the tea charade ended. They would meet again in Washington and Moscow; both meetings were strained affairs, and despite them holding hands in public  a Russian custom  few were fooled. All the hot tea they drank failed to dispel the chill between them.

Tea Tuesdays is an occasional series exploring the science, history, culture and economics of this ancient brewed beverage.

He lives vicariously through himself. He has won the lifetime achievement award, twice. In museums, he is allowed to touch the art. He is ...

... out of a job.

Since 2006, Jonathan Goldsmith has played The Most Interesting Man In The World in a popular series of ads for Dos Equis. His catchphrase  ""I don't always drink beer. But when I do, I prefer Dos Equis""  has worked its way into Internet culture.

YouTube

But his reign is ending. The newest ad for Dos Equis shows Goldsmith, as the Most Interesting Man, taking off in a spaceship on a one-way trip to Mars.

Executives from Heineken USA, which owns Dos Equis, told Ad Age that the ad campaign will continue with a new actor.

""They declined to [identify] the new star, or share details about ad plotlines, other than to say they are seeking to contemporize the campaign,"" the trade magazine reports.

Ad Age also reports that, according to the beer company, the switch is not related to Goldsmith's recent legal dispute with a former agent.

Last year, NPR's Danny Hajek spoke with Goldsmith about his career before Dos Equis  which included a stint as a garbage truck driver, a series of villainous appearances in Westerns and years spent outside of Hollywood altogether.

He tried out for the Most Interesting Man role at the suggestion of his then-agent and now wife, Barbara ... with some posthumous help from his friend Fernando Lamas, an Argentine-born actor, whose accent he adopted for the role.

His Fernando impression delighted the audition room, but Goldsmith almost didn't get the part. Here's more from the NPR interview:

""Barbara received a call from Joe Blake, the casting director. He told Barbara that they loved Goldsmith's performance, but they felt like they had to go younger. "" 'And in her infinite wisdom, she took a long pause and she said, ""Joe, how can the most interesting man in the world be young?""' Goldsmith says. 'He said, ""I'll get back to you."" ' ""Soon after, the casting director called back. He got the part.""

And as for his now-retired character, blasting off into space in an impeccable tuxedo?

""His only regret,"" the voiceover says, ""is not knowing what regret feels like.""",[]

Named for the dystopian city in Akira, ""Neo Tokyo"" opens the album in typical Perturbator fashion: Heavy cyberpunk synths deliver savage four-on-the-floors with soaring Gothic melodies. This is where Kent excels, for sure, but here, his sense of texture and composition gives more weight to the finer details. Crank the bass and there's something truly disorienting about those subs, which in lesser hands might just be noise. After a glitching break, a tonal shift occurs that breaks up the darkness for just the briefest moment before giving way to cacophonous strings.

While most of the country would be happy never to hear the word ""Deflategate"" ever again, people named Goodell are still very concerned with the year-old scandal and whether New England Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady tampered with game balls.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell  whose four-game suspension of Brady was overturned by a judge  is likely keeping a close eye on the Deflategate case as it winds its way through federal appeals court. But there's another Goodell committed to proving Brady didn't do it.

Ben Goodell, a seventh-grader from Lynn, Mass., dedicated his science fair project to measuring how weather conditions affected the PSI [pounds per square inch] of footballs in a bid to prove the Patriots did nothing illicit.

""I wanted to prove that Tom Brady is innocent,"" the 12-year-old St. Pius V Elementary School student, who isn't related to the NFL commissioner, told local TV station NECN.

And his project won.

Goodell was one of approximately 120 students who participated in the school's annual science fair, and one of only eight to win the Outstanding Project Award, according to The Daily Item. The newspaper reports Goodell began his experiment with a football inflated to the NFL standard and then exposed it to different weather conditions, including humidity, snow, wind chill, cold and ice.

""Every time, it dropped two PSI [pounds per square inch],"" Goodell, a Patriots fan, told the Item. ""The lowest PSI recorded during deflategate was 2 PSI under proper inflation.""

Principal Paul D. Maestranzi said the goal of the science fair is to get students to try and answer an everyday question.

""It's more tied in with current thinking,"" he told the newspaper. ""I think some people think science is only in a laboratory. It's really all around us all the time. That's what gets kids hooked: relevance.""

So, kudos to Ben Goodell for his experiment. Hopefully, Deflategate  the stale and bungled controversy that it is  will soon cease to be relevant.",[]

John Powers reviews a new graphic novel that he describes as an astonishing work of imagination by the Singaporean writer and illustrator Sonny Liew. It's called The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. Our critic-at-large John Powers has a review of a new graphic novel that he describes as an astonishing work of imagination. It's by the Singaporean writer and illustrator Sonny Liew, who was born in Malaysia, studied philosophy at Cambridge University and is best known in the U.S. for his DC Comics series Doctor Fate about an Egyptian-American superhero. His new graphic novel, his biggest and most ambitious work, spans decades. Here's John's review of ""The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye.""

JOHN POWERS, BYLINE: It wasn't so long ago that comics were considered artistically marginal, adolescent fantasy. All that changed with the 1986 release of ""Maus."" Art Spiegelman's graphic novel - as they're now called - tackled the Holocaust and its effect on his family. ""Maus"" won a Pulitzer Prize and unleashed the ongoing wave of masterful books that includes Alan Moore's ""Watchmen,"" Chris Ware's ""Jimmy Corrigan"" and Allison Bechdel's ""Fun Home."" Grappling with everything from sex and politics to violence and alienation, these comics took you places that you haven't gone before.

That happens again in ""The Art of ""Charlie Chan Hock Chye,"" a startlingly brilliant tour de force by the Singapore artist and writer Sonny Liew. Although the premise sounds simple - it's the biography of a fictional comic book artist - what Liew does with it is anything but. At once dizzyingly meta and deeply heartfelt, the book spans 80 years and in its complicated layering remind me of everything from ""Maus"" and ""The Tin Drum"" to, believe it or not, ""Ulysses.""

The book's hero is Chan Hock Chye. His English-language name in a little joke is Charlie. Chan is born in 1938 Singapore. And from the beginning, this shopkeeper's son loves to draw. When he first discovers comic books at the local library, he's forever smitten. He dedicates his whole life to making them, becoming a monk of the craft. Never married, he turns down commercial jobs to spend decades creating comics that don't make money. But while Chan personally leads a quiet, almost invisible existence, his career is shot through with the great drama of history.

He lives through the epic transformation of his tiny island home from a Third World outpost of the British Empire to a sleek country often called the Switzerland of Asia, clean, orderly and so prosperous that its per capita GDP is one and a half times our own. Over the years, Chan experiences the Japanese invasion of World War II, Singapore's messy struggle for independence and the eventual emergence of a seemingly all-powerful ruling party. He watches this skillfully run if sometimes repressive state become a safe haven where billionaires move to stash their cash.

Now, Liew doesn't present this transformation so baldly. We watch it happen by reading the comics that Chan supposedly creates about these events. Of course, Liew himself creates them all, both naive and sophisticated, with dazzling virtuosity. Man, can this guy draw. Giving us a grand tour of comic book history, he works in styles that reference everything from Britain's ""The Beano"" and Japanese manga to Mad Magazine, ""Pogo,"" ""Spiderman,"" even Scrooge McDuck. Every page hums with visual invention, including those pages in which Liew himself turns up, a bespectacled little dude, to comment on the action.

Although ""The Art Charlie Chan Hock Chye"" is probably the greatest work of art ever produced in Singapore, the book was controversial there. It's not a country big on dissent, and Liew points out the cracks in the official myths erected by the party that's ruled for the last half-century. Yet at the same time, he hasn't written a subversive tract or poisoned pen letter.

Even as he regrets the country's missed opportunities, the book is filled with affection, even love. It's a Valentine to cartooning, to old buildings and street food, to heroes written out of official history, to ordinary people trying to make a better life. Most moving and most universal is Liew's portrait of the artist as a young, middle-aged and old man. By today's standards, Chan would be considered a failure. His work doesn't sell. His apartment is modest. And as the country around him grows richer and glossier, he lives in obscurity, all alone, creating comics about a success-mad culture that ignores him.

Near the end, the aging Chan jets to San Diego to attend Comic-Con in hopes of finding kindred spirits and maybe landing some work. The trip doesn't pan out, yet he doesn't let this disappointment stop him. Back home, surrounded by his pens and ink bottle, he keeps doing what he's always done - pursuing his art in the face of a world that doesn't seem to want it. You see, Chan would rather remain marginal forever than give up doing what he cares about most. And Liew makes it heartbreakingly clear that such devotion is one of the highest forms of grace.

We speak and write well most of the time.

There are, however, words and phrases that trip us up. Listeners, readers and our colleagues cringe at the mistakes.

This is going to be a living post. Were starting with some of the common mistakes. There are some links to where you can get help on the proper usages. Well add to the list as suggestions  perhaps we should say complaints  come in. The hope is that if the problem cases are identified, theyll become less common as times goes on.

 Advance planning: One of many pleonasms we should avoid.

 Anniversary: It is redundant to say one-year or five-year or 10-year ... anniversary.



 Begs the question: If you think that means raises the question, you will incur the wrath of dozens or more audience members.

 But: Its a little word we use far too often and in ways we shouldnt.

-- Countless: Do you really mean there are too many to count? Or that theres an indefinitely large number? Should you be saying hundreds or thousands?



 Data: At NPR, we use plural verbs and pronouns when referring to data  unless, that is, were confident were using the word as a collective noun. Tip: If you can substitute the word information, thats a sign youre using data as a collective noun. If the word numbers is the proper substitute, than you need plural verbs and pronouns.

 Farther and further: Use farther when discussing distances. Further is for issues involving matters of degree.

 Fewer or less? Do you choose your supermarket based on what the sign says over the express aisle? Some people do. Fewer is the word to use when things can be counted. Less is to be used when when youre talking about mass quantities.

 Interpreters and translators: An interpreter turns spoken words into another language. A translator works with written words.

 Lay and lie: Stop and check yourself before choosing between these words. Go here or here. At the very least, remember this: You lay down a book; you lie down to rest.

 Lecterns and podiums: You stand on a podium. You put your notes on a lectern, which you sit or stand behind.



 Marine, sailor, soldier: A Marine is not a soldier or a sailor. A sailor is not a Marine or a soldier. A soldier is not a sailor or a Marine. Be careful when referring to them.

 Media: NPR treats media as a plural.

 Percent and percentage point: When comparing changes in two percentages, the difference is expressed in percentage points. For example, if 36% of Little Valley Central Schools class of 76 show up at next years reunion, that will be an increase of 5 percentage points from the 31% turnout 10 years ago. Attendance, though, will go up 15%. Thats because the 15 who come next year would mark a 15% increase from the 13 who attended in 06.

 Reticent and reluctant: They do not mean the same thing. Websters defines reticent as habitually silent or uncommunicative; disinclined to speak readily; reserved; taciturn and having a restrained, quiet or understated quality.



 Shrink, shrank and shrunk; sink, sank and sunk: William Safire weighed in on these words back in 1995. Tip: The movie should have been called Honey, I Shrank the Kids.

 Vast majority: The best advice is to just not say it. Youll probably be wrong. Use facts instead.

But it was still heard 202 times in the past year. The odds are a bit better than 50-50 that it will be said in the next 24 hours.

Thats a problem.

After all, since we cant seem to agree on what the words mean or when they should be put together, it seems reasonable to conclude that listeners arent sure either. Whats more, attaching the word vast to majority is a judgment call. Whos saying its a vast majority? Whats the proof? Maybe its just a significant majority. Or a sizeable one. Or just a majority.

When possible, the best course is to use facts rather than just the vast majority label. Establish, for example, that

92 percent of those surveyed agreed and then, perhaps, talk about what such a vast majority means.

This brings to mind other guidance about:

 Avoiding cliches.

 Labels.

 Killing adjectives.

 Precision writing and editing.

 Words that get abused.

Note: My thanks to listener/reader Anne Sovik for suggesting we look into vast majority.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. Master percussionist Roman Diaz has releases his debut album as a leader called ""L'o Da Fun Bata."" Diaz arrived in New York from Havana, Cuba in 1999 and has since become a mainstay in the avant-garde jazz and Afro-Cuban music communities. Milo says this new album is the best presentation he's ever heard of musical ceremonies honoring deities transplanted from Nigeria to Cuba.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ELEGUA"")

ROMAN DIAZ: (Singing in foreign language).

MILO MILES, BYLINE: It's easy to forget when oceans of music are available for streaming at any time but certain powerful styles are tough to make effective as straight recordings. Muslim Sufi music, for instance, can be mildly engrossing as pure sound but only clicks when it's experienced along with the whirling, hypnotic dancers. For me, an even more confounding example are musical ceremonies attached to the Afro-Cuban religious practice known as Santeria or Lucumi or Osha, originally transported from the Aruba people of Nigeria. Roman Diaz's version of the style, like all others, is purely voices and percussion.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""OGGUN"")

DIAZ: (Singing in foreign language).

MILES: Over the years, I've heard more than a few albums that featured or at least included Lucumi ceremonies. Now, what I call drum and chant records are intrinsically challenging to get across to an audience that cannot see the performance and does not speak the language. There seemed to be too much emphasis on simplicity and authenticity. These are works you could study but not enjoy. You felt like a tourist, not a captivated listener. This is not the case with Roman Diaz's ""L'o Da Fun Bata,"" which is a joy for those unfamiliar with the tradition. Diaz introduces most tracks by reciting brief oracle poetry in the Afrocubanismo style developed during the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s and '30s. The biggest surprise of the record is that these passages do not break up the flow but enhance the rhythmic texture.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""OBATALA"")

DIAZ: (Singing in foreign language).

MILES: It's tricky to pin down exactly why ""L'o Da Fun Bata"" excels at being both a spiritual statement and essential work of art. The tracks present nonstop variety, as though the personalities of the Osha deities are more vividly detailed than on other recordings. Perhaps the choir work is more frankly melodic, and it's certainly impeccably harmonized. I would single out the soaring Nina Rodriguez as my favorite voice. The most likely explanation is that ""L'o Da Fun Bata"" never feels like sequences of bata drums, choirs, solo sings, more bata drums, but a mesh of all the players. As Diaz himself puts it, we are molecules in one nucleus. We all work together as one. If you are the least interested in this venerable African, Cuban, American tradition, ""L'o Da Fun Bata"" is where to begin.

GROSS: Milo Miles reviewed the new album ""L'o Da Fun Bata"" led by percussionist Roman Diaz. Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, inside the East Bay Rats, an Oakland motorcycle club with a reputation for boozing and brawling. Our guest will be writer Alex Abramovich who wrote about the Rats after discovering that one of the members was the guy who bullied him years ago when they were kids. Abramovich has a new book called ""Bullies: A Friendship."" I hope you'll join us.

Did Myanmar hold its most free elections in decades?

No, as a listener told us, it held its freest elections in decades.

Todays question: When should we use more or most instead of -er or -est to form comparatives and superlatives?

To figure out the answer, it helps to count syllables.

Fowlers Modern English Usage says that adjectives of one or two syllables normally form their comparative and superlative forms by adding er and est. ... Adjectives of more than two syllables are normally preceded by more or most ...

The BBC puts it this way: It is clear that adjectives of one syllable normally end in -er and est in their comparative and superlative forms whilst the comparative and superlative of adjectives with three or more syllables are formed with more and most.

The Chicago Manual of Style agrees. It notes, however, that a few one-syllable adjectives  such as real, right, and wrong  can take only more and most. ... Eager, proper, and somber, unlike many two-syllable adjectives, also take only more and most. It sagely advises consulting a good dictionary. (NPR uses Websters New World College Dictionary, Fifth Edition.)

Finally, in 1925 my great uncle Frederick Memmott and fellow educator Nell Young, in the sixth grade edition of their textbooks Good English in Speaking and Writing, told students that nearly all our adjectives containing only one syllable are compared by adding the syllables -er and -est. Some of our adjectives containing two or more syllables are compared by adding -er and -est, but others require the use of the words more and most. All the adjectives containing more than two syllables require the use of more and most in comparing things.

There you go. If the adjective has one or two syllables, you almost always add er and est. When there are three or more syllables, more and most are almost certainly the words to choose. Check the dictionary if youre not sure.

Uncle Frederick died 32 years before I was born. I dont know this for sure, but I trust he would have thanked us for keeping these guidelines in mind.

i Todd Davidson/Illustration Works/Corbis Todd Davidson/Illustration Works/Corbis

As we launch into Thanksgiving week, consider this: Research shows that feeling grateful doesn't just make you feel good. It also helps  literally helps  the heart.

A positive mental attitude is good for your heart. It fends off depression, stress and anxiety, which can increase the risk of heart disease, says Paul Mills, a professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California San Diego School of Medicine. Mills specializes in disease processes and has been researching behavior and heart health for decades. He wondered if the very specific feeling of gratitude made a difference, too.

So he did a study. He recruited 186 men and women, average age 66, who already had some damage to their heart, either through years of sustained high blood pressure or as a result of heart attack or even an infection of the heart itself. They each filled out a standard questionnaire to rate how grateful they felt for the people, places or things in their lives.

It turned out the more grateful people were, the healthier they were. ""They had less depressed mood, slept better and had more energy,"" says Mills.

And when Mills did blood tests to measure inflammation, the body's natural response to injury, or plaque buildup in the arteries, he found lower levels among those who were grateful  an indication of better heart health.

So Mills did a small follow-up study to look even more closely at gratitude. He tested 40 patients for heart disease and noted biological indications of heart disease such as inflammation and heart rhythm. Then he asked half of the patients to keep a journal most days of the week, and write about two or three things they were grateful for. People wrote about everything, from appreciating children to being grateful for spouses, friends, pets, travel, jobs and even good food.

After two months, Mills retested all 40 patients and found health benefits for the patients who wrote in their journals. Inflammation levels were reduced, and heart rhythm improved. And when he compared their heart disease risk before and after journal writing, there was a decrease in risk after two months of writing in their journals. Those results have been submitted to a journal, but aren't yet published.

Mills isn't sure exactly how gratitude helps the heart, but he thinks it's because it reduces stress, a huge factor in heart disease.

""Taking the time to focus on what you are thankful for,"" he says, ""letting that sense of gratitude wash over you  this helps us manage and cope.""

And helps keep our hearts healthy.",[]

Alex Abramovich was in his 30s when he looked up a guy who had bullied him in grade school. In his new memoir, Abramovich writes about reconnecting with Trevor, now the head of a motorcycle club.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. You've probably had the experience of reconnecting with a childhood friend and being surprised at the direction your friend's life has taken and perhaps discovering that you each have different memories of that childhood friendship. Our guest, writer Alex Abramovich, was in his 30s when he looked up a guy who'd bullied him in grade school, and he found his old tormentor, Trevor, was still using his fists. He headed a motorcycle club in Oakland, called the East Bay Rats, which had a reputation for boozing and brawling. The Rats regularly held neighborhood fistfights at a boxing ring behind their clubhouse, events they promoted with sweatshirts that read, East Bay Fight Night, Support Consensual Bloodshed. Abramovich wrote a magazine piece about the East Bay Rats then moved to Oakland for four years, where he spent so much time with the club that members like to say that he'd embedded with them. His new memoir is about the biker subculture, the struggling city of Oakland and his reflections on the violence in the East Bay Rats' lives and his own. It's called ""Bullies: A Friendship."" He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies.

DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Alex Abramovich, welcome to FRESH AIR. Tell us about your memories of Trevor Latham as a child.

ALEX ABRAMOVICH: I remember Trevor as a large, menacing, angry boy, which is funny because when I went back and met him years later and saw photos of him, it turned out that he was a little boy - we were both pretty little kids - and he only had his growth spurt years after I'd initially met him. But I remembered him as just this malevolent force in my life.

DAVIES: When you were how old?

ABRAMOVICH: I would've been 7 years old, and this was in the fourth grade and my dad and I had just moved to a new town. I'd only moved in with my dad the previous year. My mom had died that year so I'd moved in with my father. And then my dad lost his job almost immediately so we moved from Massachusetts in with my grandma in Brooklyn, and then towards the end of that year, we moved to Long Island, which is where I met Trevor. And I was only in that school for two years, but in my memory he loomed as this sort of - the archetypal bully. He was the bully I remembered out of all the bullies I'd known.

DAVIES: So you were classmates. Would he, like, wait for you after school or - what kinds of - if you remember, what kinds of encounters were they?

ABRAMOVICH: Well, our memories are different. My memories diverge from Trevor's. My memory is of Trevor, you know, being the sort of kid that would meet you at the schoolhouse door and threaten to meet you back there at the end of the school day and threaten to beat me up, threaten to kill me. And the way I remember it, he did meet me at the schoolhouse door at the end of the day and he did beat me up, and I remember rolling around on the ground with him tussling, kicking, biting - a lot of fear.

DAVIES: And, if you remember, why was he bullying you? Do you recall having a sense of what motivated him?

ABRAMOVICH: At the time, I had no idea. At the time, I was just this confused, scared kid and here was this force of nature that I suddenly encountered and couldn't quite get around. So I was beyond thinking of motivations at that point. I was just - you know, I was just a mess.

DAVIES: So a lot of time goes by and you reconnect. How did that happen?

ABRAMOVICH: You know how people you met before the Internet existed, you sort of never think to Google them?

DAVIES: Right.

ABRAMOVICH: It was that sort of thing with Trevor. I remembered him and I remembered his name, but I'd never thought to Google him until one day I did. And a very short thing came up on the screen that said, I moved to California, became a bouncer and started a motorcycle club. So I knew at that point that we were - we would meet again. That was too good to pass up.

DAVIES: So you connect and you go out to Oakland. And when you saw him for the first time as an adult, what did he look like?

ABRAMOVICH: He looked like a whale walking upright. He's a massive guy, shaved head, goatee, Roman nose. Just big, big. All of those guys are big, all of the guys in his club. And he was surrounded by the guys in his club the first time I saw him, but even then he stood out. And he looked nothing at all like the boy I'd known, but somehow I knew him immediately. I recognized him, I knew exactly which one he was. And the first time I saw him, he had a - it was in a bar, and he was a bouncer at the bar and he had a guy backed up against the wall and was holding him by the scruff of his shirt so he looked extra menacing.

DAVIES: Did you connect right away? I mean, what - how did he react to your getting in touch?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor's club is the East Bay Rats, that's his motorcycle club, and they have a website - a very bare-bones, old-fashioned website, but Trevor's number is on it. It was a 510 number, and I dialed it, and he was at the bar when I called him. And I said, you don't know me but I used to know you in grade school. We used to know each other in grade school. And, without missing a beat, he said, Alex Abramovich? It was very strange. And we started emailing - texting, but mostly emailing. It was really before texting - late at night, and sort of comparing memories, which turned out to be very different, his and mine. So there was a basis for communication by the time I got out to Oakland, and we got along well. We sat at his bar and - he stopped bouncing - sat down at the bar, and we drank whiskey and then we were drunk. So that's how that first meeting went.

DAVIES: And you hadn't seen each other since the fourth grade, but you clearly remembered him. You'd spoken to your friends about him. So the bullying really left an impression on you. When you reconnected as adults, what was his memory of your relationship as kids?

ABRAMOVICH: Well, I remembered him in part, I think - in retrospect, it seems to me that I remembered him because Trevor Latham is such a strong, good name for a bully. The way he remembered it - it's interesting, in the specific details of what we did - our fights, our memories - pretty much aligned. He remembers fighting, he remembers fighting in the classroom, teachers breaking us up. He remembers us getting sent down to the principal's office. He remembered our fathers having to pick us up at school - much more specific memories than I had, actually. But, weirdly enough, he also remembers that I was bullying him as much as he was bullying me, and, moreover, he remembers that despite that we were good friends at the time. He remembers us playing chess, going to each other's houses. I don't remember any of this. Didn't then, don't now.

DAVIES: And with the light of all of the experience, what's your best guess as to who's right?

ABRAMOVICH: I think in way we're both right. You know, I was an angry, messed-up kid and I'm sure that there were times when I was the aggressor, especially if this was an ongoing, you know, broken relationship between us. But what's also interesting about it is that our - the specific details of our memories line up, but that makes me think that Trevor's a bully, whereas it leads him to think that because we were fighting all the time that meant we must've been friends.

DAVIES: Wow. So he saw - he saw somebody he fought with all the time as a friend.

ABRAMOVICH: Well, not only that, but he grew up to be friends with people he fought with all the time, professionally.

DAVIES: Right, which we're going to get to. But before that, tell me a little about your family and his family when you were kids.

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. Trevor comes from a very, very old family in Long Island, the Lathams, and if you go out to the very northernmost tip of Long Island to Orient, the town called Orient, you'll see the name everywhere on farm stands, hardware stores - it's Latham, Latham, Latham. So his family had been on Long Island forever, and they became very successful. They were lawyers and architects, and there was money. And Trevor's father grew up on an estate on the North Shore in these sort of Gatsby-esque surroundings, but by the time I knew Trevor, the money was sort of gone. His family had split up. His mother and sisters had moved to California so it was just Trevor and Trevor's dad - who was unemployed at the time - sort of stuck in that house.

DAVIES: And do you know what kind of relationship he had with his dad?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor describes his father as being a very angry individual. I think there was a lot of rage. There were holes in the sheetrock where his dad had punched through them. What Trevor told me when I met him was, my father didn't really hit me but the threat was always there, and the threat was more frightening than actually being hit because when anything is possible all the time, sort of all bets are off.

DAVIES: And what was your childhood like with your dad after your mom died?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, my family immigrated to America in 1976 so we didn't really know anyone in the country. And my parents split up about six months after we got here so my mom and I went to live in Pittsburgh and my dad went to live in New York. And he'd visit and I'd see him. We were close, but physically, we were removed by hundreds of miles. And then when my mom got too sick to take care of me, I stayed with a series of family friends. So by the time I went to live with my dad, there'd been a series of sort of dislocations for me, and I think I was already a pretty messed up and somewhat out-of-control kid and a lot for my father to handle. My father - who would've been younger than I am now, I think - all of a sudden is saddled with this damaged, you know, semi-feral child, which was what I was at that time, and I think it was overwhelming for him in some ways. I know I was a lot to handle. And then on top of that, they weren't the best economic times and we had no family in the country, we had no economic safety net. We didn't really know our neighbors so it was very isolating, and all the more isolating because we kept moving. I think by the time I started fourth grade, I had been to eight or nine schools - something like that. So it was hard at home. I think Trevor in some ways had it harder than me, but there were certainly points at which I could relate to his story when I met him.

DAVIES: Well, you go out to Oakland, you connect with Trevor, and he is the head of the East Bay Rats motorcycle club. There are lots of different kinds of motorcycle clubs, you know, some more benign than others. Give us your early impressions of the East Bay Rats.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah, I mean, I think most people picture, you know, ""Sons Of Anarchy,"" let's say, when they picture a motorcycle club, and there's a grain of truth to that depiction, although there's a lot that actual bikers would quibble with. The Rats sort of ride the line between presenting as a criminal organization, but they're not really criminals. They're more - they're miscreants and they're hooligans, but there are no real criminal enterprises. That said, there are a lot of them. There are about 35 at any given time. It's about the size of an Army platoon. They're big. They're not conflict-averse. And they're intimidating, they're in uniform. They're wearing motorcycle leathers, they're wearing armor, they're wearing helmets, they're wearing basically the best gear you could possibly wear in a street fight. And they know what they look like - they're very self-aware - so they're very good at gauging how intimidating they're being or presenting at any given moment.

DAVIES: Describe the clubhouse.

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. The clubhouse is an old barbershop on San Pablo Avenue, which was the oldest street in the East Bay, it used to be the Camino Real. And the clubhouse was - it was always sort of a clubhouse. It was a barbershop. It was an African-American barbershop. So it was always sort of a meeting place. In 2006, the first time I saw it, there was a speak-easy bar next door. That bar, I found out, used to be Huey Newton's speak-easy when he was on that stretch of San Pablo. So it was always this community center, that block, but that said, it had fallen on very tough times indeed. There were a lot of homeless people, there were a lot of recyclers pushing shopping carts, a lot of drugs. There was a lot of violence. So, you know, there'd be bloodstains on the sidewalk and - and the clubhouse itself was about the size of a barbershop with a backyard. And it was a concrete floor, sheetrock walls, boxing equipment wherever you looked. There was a bar that Trevor had installed stripper poles on and women would get up there during parties they threw. And, in the back, there was a barbecue pit and Trevor's old truck, and it was an old Ford Bronco that he'd painted flat black, and a boxing - well, the first time I saw it, there was no boxing ring. There were couches arranged in a square, and that's what served as a boxing ring. Later on, they got an actual boxing ring and put it in back there.

DAVIES: You said that these guys are not conflict averse, which is a nice way of saying they seem to love to mix it up. And there's a section that I'd like you to read here where you're talking about one of the club's members, a guy named John Firpo (ph), and his interaction with a stranger who had said the wrong thing. Do you want to read this for us?

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. (Reading) John Firpo had George Bellows' painting tattooed on his torso. Now I watched him punch the stranger who'd said the wrong thing. A single blow was all that it took to put the man on the concrete. This was a thing the Rats did, for the bored and unstable, for masochists or men who are eager to show off and prove themselves in some dumb way. There was no shame in getting beaten up by one of the Rats. Anyone could walk into the clubhouse, tell one of them off. They'd kick your [expletive] immediately without getting mad or taking things personally.

They were not conflict averse. They wouldn't even gang up on you necessarily. Beat downs were like a community service the Rats provided. The stranger didn't take his personally. He got back on his feet and apologized, told Firpo that his mom had just died, that he'd been messed up, at his wits end and had not meant to say anything all. Now that he had, he was sorry. I'm sorry about your mother, said Firpo as he guided the man out of the clubhouse.

DAVIES: (Laughter) That's a - this is a remarkable scene, and it's almost as if these guys use violence the way others use language, isn't it?

ABRAMOVICH: That's a beautiful way of putting it. Yeah, it's a form of communication and it's also a form of exchanging affections.

DAVIES: Alex Abramovich is our guest. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, our guest is writer Alex Abramovich. His new book, ""Bullies: A Friendship,"" is about a friendship that he renewed with a kid he'd known from his youth who turns out to have founded a motorcycle club in Oakland. Alex Abramovich spent a lot of time there.

Now, the club, as we read your book, seems less about riding bikes than about fighting. And Trevor organized fight nights at which the public would be invited and he would have people in the boxing ring out back. Initially you say it was just a bunch of couches arranged in a square, but eventually there was a boxing ring. Do you want to describe one of these events for us?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, they sound different than they are to attend. They're fun in real life, although they're bloody and violent. And sometimes they were impromptu. Sometimes people - fights would just break out. But sometimes they were very organized and they would have themes. There was, in fact, the Jews versus Gentiles fight night, which would be a two-man versus two-man fight, so a four-man fight. And it would be over bragging rights for who could name the next holiday party. Would it be a Christmas party or would it be a Hanukkah party. And it was billed as the battle of the sects.

DAVIES: The battle of the sects, OK, S-E-C-T, OK.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. So fliers went out all over town. And there was a series of undercards, so a lot of other people fought before the Jews and the Gentiles got into the ring. And oddly enough, I didn't know that there were too many Jewish bikers out there. I'd never really run into them in New York, but there are a couple. In the ring, the violence was very contained. And the further away you went from the ring, the more violent things got. And sort of once you slipped into the shadows, you'd start seeing really nasty things happening. So at the time that the Jews and the Gentiles are fighting in the ring in the back, out front on San Pablo Avenue some recyclers are maybe getting beaten up for instance.

DAVIES: Recyclers - these are, like, guys who pick up cans to get, you know, food for their habits or whatever, right?

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. I mean, there's a recycling center that's a few blocks from the clubhouse. And it's a source of constant tension in the neighborhood because not only are the recyclers with their shopping carts always clogging up San Pablo Avenue, but there are problems having to do with people's houses getting broken into, tools getting stolen, pipes getting stolen. In fact, the East Bay Rats' clubhouse was broken into while I was there and Trevor's plumbing was stolen.

And then there are also issues having to do with public urination, public defecation, prostitution, drug dealing. And remarkably enough, some of the recyclers seem to think that if they'd break their bags full of bottles - they're sold by weight. So they think that if they break their bags full of bottles they'll weigh more because broken glass weighs more than intact bottles. So there's this constant soundtrack of breaking glass.

DAVIES: You describe an incident that you witnessed between some members of the motorcycle club, the East Bay Rats, and a recycler. You want to tell us about that?

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. So the recyclers are kind of a constant presence and when the Rats drink beer, which they do all the time and in fact there's a soda machine that sells dollar beers in the clubhouse, they'll just toss the empties outside and the empties will be gone within 30 seconds or a minute. And that's their form of recycling.

So at the night of one of the fight nights, there was a recycler who kept hovering right around the door. And usually what'll happen at a fight night or an East Bay Rats party is all of the Rats and people belonging to other clubs will ride up to the clubhouse and park their bikes in a neat line down the length of the block. So it makes for quite a visual. And on one night, I saw there was a recycler who kept darting in in between their legs right outside the clubhouse front door to get the cans, basically, to get empty beer cans.

And, you know, there are often people hanging around the Rats who want to impress them, who want to be prospects for the club. And someone like that was around that evening. And he got up at one point, got up off the motorcycle he was sitting on, walked over to the recycler and shoved him hard into the line of bikes. And, you know, I was holding my breath, and for a minute I thought it was going to be OK, but it wasn't OK. Another Rat came up and touching the bike was enough it turned out. Everyone was drunk and a Rat went up and he knocked the man down to the ground. And then a couple of other Rats came out and they knocked the man to the ground. And San Pablo is a wide avenue. It's four lanes with a big median strip. And the man crawled over - the recycler crawled over the median strip and - onto the oncoming traffic lane. And I turned and I saw one of the Rats flip the visor on his helmet down and he was on his motorcycle and he rode it around the median strip. And he rode it up to the recycler who was lying on the ground at this point bleeding. And he rolled his bike back and forth sort of nudging the recycler a few times with the front tire. And then he gunned it and he rode over the recycler's torso, which was very horrible to watch and horrible to think about and horrible also to think that I could've done something to stop it in real time. And I didn't realize that in real time and didn't do anything to stop it, so not a proud moment for me.

DAVIES: And the recycler survived, got up and walked away?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I turned around and I thought I was going to throw up when I saw them ride over the recycler's body. And when I turned back around, the recycler was gone. I was expecting him to be lying on the cement with broken bones, but he had scampered away. The next time I saw Trevor, Trevor said, you'd be surprised. Crack heads are surprisingly resilient, and I said I wish I could've done something to stop it, and Trevor said you could've. All it takes is someone saying stop.

GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Alex Abramovich about his new book, ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll hear more of the interview after a break. And we'll remember The Beatles' record producer George Martin, who died yesterday at age 90. We'll listen back to an interview I recorded with him about helping shape their early sound and about producing ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Alex Abramovich about his new memoir, ""Bullies: A Friendship."" It's about reconnecting with a guy who'd bullied him when they were kids. When they reconnected, that guy, Trevor, was the head of a motorcycle club in East Oakland called the East Bay Rats, which was known for their bruising and brawling. The book is in part about that subculture.

DAVIES: What was the East Bay Rats' attitude towards racial diversity? I mean, there's - it's a city with a history of some racial issues certainly.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. I didn't know this before I started writing the book, but it turns out that many motorcycle clubs are formed along racial lines. I mean, they form along all sorts of lines. They form along - the police themselves in Oakland have a motorcycle club. In fact, there are two motorcycle clubs associated with the police out there. But well-known national clubs tend to break down along racial lines, and the Rats do not. There are African-American members. There are Jewish members, as I mentioned. There are Mexican-American members. So for the Rats, that's never really been an issue. It's very inclusive in that way. And it's also inclusive sexually I would say. Gays and lesbians are always welcome in the clubhouse. They're welcome in the - at fight nights. It's an interesting question what would happen if an openly gay man were to try to join the Rats. I'm not sure how that would fly. But in terms of people they hang out with, it's absolutely copacetic. So in that sense, the Rats are not - I would say that the Rats are more evolved in certain ways than our present political moment.

DAVIES: And what about their attitude towards women? You know, you hear of motorcycle clubs having women with - wearing things saying that they're the club's property.

ABRAMOVICH: I mean, they're not models of enlightened 21st-century, you know, men. And the gender roles are - tend to be a little old-fashioned maybe by standards employed elsewhere in the Bay Area. There are a couple of young women who hung out with the Rats. Bea (ph) and an Amber (ph) are their names, and they made themselves patches that read East Bay Cats (ph). So they were sort of like the girls auxiliary. But that's not quite the same as saying property of. On the other hand, it's certainly true - and I saw this time and again - that the Rats are both incredibly attractive for and aware of their own attractiveness to certain kinds of women in Oakland. And they take full advantage of that. And the full advantage of that might involve orgies in the back of the bar or the clubhouse. I don't think they really do this anymore. You know, they've aged out of it and they're family men now, but there was a lot of stuff going on in relation to girls.

DAVIES: Were there any stories of rape or sexual abuse of women in the club?

ABRAMOVICH: No. I never heard anything remotely about a rape and I think that I would've. I spent four years with those guys and I spent a lot of that time with people who didn't like those guys, so I would've heard about it. I heard a lot of messed up sexual stories, but nothing that wasn't consensual.

The one thing that happened while I was out there was that at one of the fight nights there was a man that assaulted a young woman. And they were making out and he started choking her and then she was on the ground and then she ran into the clubhouse covered in blood. And she said that this guy had tried to rape her and the Rats came down immediately like avenging angels, and they beat that guy to within an inch of his life. And Trevor said that as I was hitting him I was really sad because I really like this guy but here he was, you know, but then he also felt sad that he didn't break the guy's legs with a shovel.

DAVIES: Because there was a code of some kind.

ABRAMOVICH: The code is - there are rules. They're written down. I wasn't allowed to see them. Prospects aren't even allowed to see them. You're only allowed to see them once you patch in as a member. But I know what some of the rules are, and there are rules governing the treatment of women and the word respect comes up very often. So not only do you not disrespect women when they're around you but you especially respect each other's girlfriends. You have to ask permission before you date someone's ex-girlfriend. As you would imagine, this leads to a certain amount of friction.

DAVIES: You spent some time with the motorcycle club the East Bay Rats when you were writing a magazine article. Then you went back to New York and eventually came back to Oakland with your girlfriend and lived there for quite a while. So you had a lot of experience and spent a lot of time with the guys in the club. What did they think of you?

ABRAMOVICH: They didn't know what to make of me. The first time I met them when I was writing the magazine article, Trevor had told everyone that I was his bully, so they couldn't wait to see the guy who had bullied the president of their motorcycle club. And they were surprised when this, you know, 5-foot-8 guy with glasses stepped out of his rental car.

DAVIES: (Laughter).

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor does not wear glasses and he's well over 6 feet tall. And they did what they would do to anyone that they liked initially - they hazed me. And they put me on a motorcycle on my first full day in Oakland, my first morning in Oakland. And they put me on a motorcycle that I was guaranteed to crash, which I did crash. And I crashed it right away and I crashed it badly. I think they expected a smaller crash, but I crashed it in style. And I broke my hand, but weirdly enough, my hand - I don't know if it was the adrenaline or just the way the nerves are arranged, but for whatever reason my hand didn't hurt until I got back to New York. So instead of going to the hospital, I wrapped it up in boxing tape and I stayed out there for a week, and I kept reporting.

So in a sense we sort of got the hazing out of the way very early and I think that I ended up presenting or appearing as a much braver person than I actually am. If my hand had actually been hurting I would've gone to the hospital. But then the magazine article came out six or seven months later and the Rats liked that very much. They're not criminals, so they don't make any money off the club, so the coin for them is publicity. And they're savvy when it comes to publicity, and this was publicity on a grand national scale, so they liked that a lot.

So the magazine article came out, and it brought them a fair amount of welcome attention, including sexual attention, and they like that. So there was a certain amount of goodwill, I would say, built in by the time I arrived back at the club. But it's a club with, you know, as I said, 35 members and some of them like the cameras and some of them don't like the cameras. And that's a dynamic in and of itself, just having a camera changes what's happening at the clubhouse. So there were Rats that didn't like me at all and probably still don't like me and they pretty much stayed away from me. John Firpo, who we mentioned already, took a very active dislike to me. And John Firpo is a very large and very intimidating, scary dude. And that was unpleasant. John and I got along fine now, but...

DAVIES: Well, I was going to - did you feel afraid ever? I mean, you were there for some long nights with a lot of drinking and I'm sure they got really rowdy. Did you feel afraid?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I didn't feel afraid because I was in - I was working. I was there to take notes. I was drinking sometimes, but I was still working. And there was a sort of circle of safety involved when you were with Trevor. So as long as I stayed within that circle of safety, I felt OK. Now, there were things that happened at the periphery that were not OK and that were scary and frightening and genuinely I would say lightweight dangerous.

DAVIES: Alex Abramovich is our guest. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, we're speaking with writer Alex Abramovich. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" It's about him reconnecting with a kid he'd known from his youth who turns out to have founded a motorcycle club in Oakland. Alex Abramovich spent a lot of time there.

You know, it's interesting. There are places in the book where you have long extended stories quoted verbatim from some of the bikers, particularly Trevor. I assume you carried a tape recorder a lot of the time. And he certainly sounds very well spoken. You do say you wondered at points if he was a sociopath. What made you wonder that?

ABRAMOVICH: Things he did. To give two very brief examples - one was a story that he told me. I picked him up one day. We were going somewhere and he said, you know, it's funny. A crackhead was peeing on my door last night and I opened up the door and there he was. And I took a shovel and, you know, I broke the guy's arm. I could tell I'd broken his arm from the way it was flopping around. But then, you know, I walked inside and I turned on the PlayStation and I was playing ""Star Wars Battlefront"" and I got the highest score I've ever gotten. I thought that was a strange story.

DAVIES: Trevor's life did change over time, right? What's he up to now?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor's got a very heteronormative life now. I mean, it was pretty heteronormative before, but now it's a pretty just normative let's say. He lives in Emeryville now, which is a small town next to Oakland. He moved out of Oakland because everyone is getting priced out of Oakland these days, or as Trevor put it, Oakland's getting nicer and that's great, but if it gets too much nicer, we'll all have to leave. So he left.

He got a job doing outdoor work with the city of Albany, which is another small town nearby that has really good schools that he can send his kids to. And Trevor has two little boys now. He got married. He stopped being a bouncer. At some point, he bought himself a purple Harley-Davidson. These guys all ride very fast Japanese sports bikes that they customize and turn into Rat bikes - what they call them. But Trevor bought this, you know, giant thing out of ""Purple Rain"" with a CD player, which he's since gotten rid of. Even that was too much for him. But he's got a - Trevor's very wily and he's sort of set himself up with the life that he wants and on the surface at least it looks pretty much like, you know, this American life.

DAVIES: And is there less violence in his life?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I never saw Trevor - Trevor got into fights while I was there at the bar, but I never saw Trevor inside the ring. I never actually saw him box. He and I sparred together. He taught me how to box, but I never saw him that directly involved in violence. Now he's not a bouncer at the club anymore, so that takes that whole part out of the equation. They still have fight nights, and the club's actually thriving now. It was in a bit of a lull when I was out there.

So on the one hand, he's surrounded by violence, but on the other hand, you know, he's also a father now. And he told me a funny story just this week actually. They were having a fight night and his boy Mason (ph) was there. And Mason's about 2-and-a-half, maybe going on 3 now. And Mason had seen lots of boxing and ultimate fighting on TV and he'd seen people spar at the clubhouse, but he'd never seen an actual fight. And now people are fighting in the boxing ring. And these were people that he knows and loves and cares about and they're hurting each other and they're getting hurt. And Trevor looked down at Mason and he thought, oh, my God, am I one of those parents? What am I exposing my kid to? And before he could do anything, Mesa looked up at his mom and handed her his dinosaurs and ran into the clubhouse. And Trevor - you know, Trevor went after him and he was expecting to find Mason in the corner crying, but instead Trevor said Mason was in there hitting the heavy bag.

DAVIES: Wow (laughter). How well do you feel that you know him? I mean, are you good friends now? Do you feel like you understand him?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, he's my oldest friend, I think. I've known him for 30 - is that right - 35 years now and I'm only 43. And I'm his oldest friend. So in a sense there's a very deep connection and whenever we don't see each other for a while, we pick up the thread very quickly. As far as understanding him, I think my understanding of him is contained in that I can sort of walk around him and describe him. And I think I did a pretty good job of it in the book of describing how he comes across, how his very, very unusual mind works. But in terms of really, really going in there and untangling the motivations, yeah, you know, the short answer is I do think I get it and I think I described it. He functions under tremendous internal pressures and he has absorbed a great deal of poison and he's gotten better and better at with every passing year at lancing that poison and finding productive ways to - or at least non-self-destructive ways to let seep back out into the world.

DAVIES: Well, Alex Abramovich, thanks so much for speaking with us.

ABRAMOVICH: Thanks so much, Dave. It was a pleasure.

GROSS: Alex Abramovich is the author of the new memoir ""Bullies: A Friendship."" He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies, who is also WHYY's senior reporter. Coming up, we remember George Martin who produced 13 albums by The Beatles. He died yesterday. We'll listen back to my interview with him about working with The Beatles. This is FRESH AIR.

Alex Abramovich was in his 30s when he looked up a guy who had bullied him in grade school. In his new memoir, Abramovich writes about reconnecting with Trevor, now the head of a motorcycle club.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. You've probably had the experience of reconnecting with a childhood friend and being surprised at the direction your friend's life has taken and perhaps discovering that you each have different memories of that childhood friendship. Our guest, writer Alex Abramovich, was in his 30s when he looked up a guy who'd bullied him in grade school, and he found his old tormentor, Trevor, was still using his fists. He headed a motorcycle club in Oakland, called the East Bay Rats, which had a reputation for boozing and brawling. The Rats regularly held neighborhood fistfights at a boxing ring behind their clubhouse, events they promoted with sweatshirts that read, East Bay Fight Night, Support Consensual Bloodshed. Abramovich wrote a magazine piece about the East Bay Rats then moved to Oakland for four years, where he spent so much time with the club that members like to say that he'd embedded with them. His new memoir is about the biker subculture, the struggling city of Oakland and his reflections on the violence in the East Bay Rats' lives and his own. It's called ""Bullies: A Friendship."" He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies.

DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Alex Abramovich, welcome to FRESH AIR. Tell us about your memories of Trevor Latham as a child.

ALEX ABRAMOVICH: I remember Trevor as a large, menacing, angry boy, which is funny because when I went back and met him years later and saw photos of him, it turned out that he was a little boy - we were both pretty little kids - and he only had his growth spurt years after I'd initially met him. But I remembered him as just this malevolent force in my life.

DAVIES: When you were how old?

ABRAMOVICH: I would've been 7 years old, and this was in the fourth grade and my dad and I had just moved to a new town. I'd only moved in with my dad the previous year. My mom had died that year so I'd moved in with my father. And then my dad lost his job almost immediately so we moved from Massachusetts in with my grandma in Brooklyn, and then towards the end of that year, we moved to Long Island, which is where I met Trevor. And I was only in that school for two years, but in my memory he loomed as this sort of - the archetypal bully. He was the bully I remembered out of all the bullies I'd known.

DAVIES: So you were classmates. Would he, like, wait for you after school or - what kinds of - if you remember, what kinds of encounters were they?

ABRAMOVICH: Well, our memories are different. My memories diverge from Trevor's. My memory is of Trevor, you know, being the sort of kid that would meet you at the schoolhouse door and threaten to meet you back there at the end of the school day and threaten to beat me up, threaten to kill me. And the way I remember it, he did meet me at the schoolhouse door at the end of the day and he did beat me up, and I remember rolling around on the ground with him tussling, kicking, biting - a lot of fear.

DAVIES: And, if you remember, why was he bullying you? Do you recall having a sense of what motivated him?

ABRAMOVICH: At the time, I had no idea. At the time, I was just this confused, scared kid and here was this force of nature that I suddenly encountered and couldn't quite get around. So I was beyond thinking of motivations at that point. I was just - you know, I was just a mess.

DAVIES: So a lot of time goes by and you reconnect. How did that happen?

ABRAMOVICH: You know how people you met before the Internet existed, you sort of never think to Google them?

DAVIES: Right.

ABRAMOVICH: It was that sort of thing with Trevor. I remembered him and I remembered his name, but I'd never thought to Google him until one day I did. And a very short thing came up on the screen that said, I moved to California, became a bouncer and started a motorcycle club. So I knew at that point that we were - we would meet again. That was too good to pass up.

DAVIES: So you connect and you go out to Oakland. And when you saw him for the first time as an adult, what did he look like?

ABRAMOVICH: He looked like a whale walking upright. He's a massive guy, shaved head, goatee, Roman nose. Just big, big. All of those guys are big, all of the guys in his club. And he was surrounded by the guys in his club the first time I saw him, but even then he stood out. And he looked nothing at all like the boy I'd known, but somehow I knew him immediately. I recognized him, I knew exactly which one he was. And the first time I saw him, he had a - it was in a bar, and he was a bouncer at the bar and he had a guy backed up against the wall and was holding him by the scruff of his shirt so he looked extra menacing.

DAVIES: Did you connect right away? I mean, what - how did he react to your getting in touch?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor's club is the East Bay Rats, that's his motorcycle club, and they have a website - a very bare-bones, old-fashioned website, but Trevor's number is on it. It was a 510 number, and I dialed it, and he was at the bar when I called him. And I said, you don't know me but I used to know you in grade school. We used to know each other in grade school. And, without missing a beat, he said, Alex Abramovich? It was very strange. And we started emailing - texting, but mostly emailing. It was really before texting - late at night, and sort of comparing memories, which turned out to be very different, his and mine. So there was a basis for communication by the time I got out to Oakland, and we got along well. We sat at his bar and - he stopped bouncing - sat down at the bar, and we drank whiskey and then we were drunk. So that's how that first meeting went.

DAVIES: And you hadn't seen each other since the fourth grade, but you clearly remembered him. You'd spoken to your friends about him. So the bullying really left an impression on you. When you reconnected as adults, what was his memory of your relationship as kids?

ABRAMOVICH: Well, I remembered him in part, I think - in retrospect, it seems to me that I remembered him because Trevor Latham is such a strong, good name for a bully. The way he remembered it - it's interesting, in the specific details of what we did - our fights, our memories - pretty much aligned. He remembers fighting, he remembers fighting in the classroom, teachers breaking us up. He remembers us getting sent down to the principal's office. He remembered our fathers having to pick us up at school - much more specific memories than I had, actually. But, weirdly enough, he also remembers that I was bullying him as much as he was bullying me, and, moreover, he remembers that despite that we were good friends at the time. He remembers us playing chess, going to each other's houses. I don't remember any of this. Didn't then, don't now.

DAVIES: And with the light of all of the experience, what's your best guess as to who's right?

ABRAMOVICH: I think in way we're both right. You know, I was an angry, messed-up kid and I'm sure that there were times when I was the aggressor, especially if this was an ongoing, you know, broken relationship between us. But what's also interesting about it is that our - the specific details of our memories line up, but that makes me think that Trevor's a bully, whereas it leads him to think that because we were fighting all the time that meant we must've been friends.

DAVIES: Wow. So he saw - he saw somebody he fought with all the time as a friend.

ABRAMOVICH: Well, not only that, but he grew up to be friends with people he fought with all the time, professionally.

DAVIES: Right, which we're going to get to. But before that, tell me a little about your family and his family when you were kids.

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. Trevor comes from a very, very old family in Long Island, the Lathams, and if you go out to the very northernmost tip of Long Island to Orient, the town called Orient, you'll see the name everywhere on farm stands, hardware stores - it's Latham, Latham, Latham. So his family had been on Long Island forever, and they became very successful. They were lawyers and architects, and there was money. And Trevor's father grew up on an estate on the North Shore in these sort of Gatsby-esque surroundings, but by the time I knew Trevor, the money was sort of gone. His family had split up. His mother and sisters had moved to California so it was just Trevor and Trevor's dad - who was unemployed at the time - sort of stuck in that house.

DAVIES: And do you know what kind of relationship he had with his dad?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor describes his father as being a very angry individual. I think there was a lot of rage. There were holes in the sheetrock where his dad had punched through them. What Trevor told me when I met him was, my father didn't really hit me but the threat was always there, and the threat was more frightening than actually being hit because when anything is possible all the time, sort of all bets are off.

DAVIES: And what was your childhood like with your dad after your mom died?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, my family immigrated to America in 1976 so we didn't really know anyone in the country. And my parents split up about six months after we got here so my mom and I went to live in Pittsburgh and my dad went to live in New York. And he'd visit and I'd see him. We were close, but physically, we were removed by hundreds of miles. And then when my mom got too sick to take care of me, I stayed with a series of family friends. So by the time I went to live with my dad, there'd been a series of sort of dislocations for me, and I think I was already a pretty messed up and somewhat out-of-control kid and a lot for my father to handle. My father - who would've been younger than I am now, I think - all of a sudden is saddled with this damaged, you know, semi-feral child, which was what I was at that time, and I think it was overwhelming for him in some ways. I know I was a lot to handle. And then on top of that, they weren't the best economic times and we had no family in the country, we had no economic safety net. We didn't really know our neighbors so it was very isolating, and all the more isolating because we kept moving. I think by the time I started fourth grade, I had been to eight or nine schools - something like that. So it was hard at home. I think Trevor in some ways had it harder than me, but there were certainly points at which I could relate to his story when I met him.

DAVIES: Well, you go out to Oakland, you connect with Trevor, and he is the head of the East Bay Rats motorcycle club. There are lots of different kinds of motorcycle clubs, you know, some more benign than others. Give us your early impressions of the East Bay Rats.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah, I mean, I think most people picture, you know, ""Sons Of Anarchy,"" let's say, when they picture a motorcycle club, and there's a grain of truth to that depiction, although there's a lot that actual bikers would quibble with. The Rats sort of ride the line between presenting as a criminal organization, but they're not really criminals. They're more - they're miscreants and they're hooligans, but there are no real criminal enterprises. That said, there are a lot of them. There are about 35 at any given time. It's about the size of an Army platoon. They're big. They're not conflict-averse. And they're intimidating, they're in uniform. They're wearing motorcycle leathers, they're wearing armor, they're wearing helmets, they're wearing basically the best gear you could possibly wear in a street fight. And they know what they look like - they're very self-aware - so they're very good at gauging how intimidating they're being or presenting at any given moment.

DAVIES: Describe the clubhouse.

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. The clubhouse is an old barbershop on San Pablo Avenue, which was the oldest street in the East Bay, it used to be the Camino Real. And the clubhouse was - it was always sort of a clubhouse. It was a barbershop. It was an African-American barbershop. So it was always sort of a meeting place. In 2006, the first time I saw it, there was a speak-easy bar next door. That bar, I found out, used to be Huey Newton's speak-easy when he was on that stretch of San Pablo. So it was always this community center, that block, but that said, it had fallen on very tough times indeed. There were a lot of homeless people, there were a lot of recyclers pushing shopping carts, a lot of drugs. There was a lot of violence. So, you know, there'd be bloodstains on the sidewalk and - and the clubhouse itself was about the size of a barbershop with a backyard. And it was a concrete floor, sheetrock walls, boxing equipment wherever you looked. There was a bar that Trevor had installed stripper poles on and women would get up there during parties they threw. And, in the back, there was a barbecue pit and Trevor's old truck, and it was an old Ford Bronco that he'd painted flat black, and a boxing - well, the first time I saw it, there was no boxing ring. There were couches arranged in a square, and that's what served as a boxing ring. Later on, they got an actual boxing ring and put it in back there.

DAVIES: You said that these guys are not conflict averse, which is a nice way of saying they seem to love to mix it up. And there's a section that I'd like you to read here where you're talking about one of the club's members, a guy named John Firpo (ph), and his interaction with a stranger who had said the wrong thing. Do you want to read this for us?

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. (Reading) John Firpo had George Bellows' painting tattooed on his torso. Now I watched him punch the stranger who'd said the wrong thing. A single blow was all that it took to put the man on the concrete. This was a thing the Rats did, for the bored and unstable, for masochists or men who are eager to show off and prove themselves in some dumb way. There was no shame in getting beaten up by one of the Rats. Anyone could walk into the clubhouse, tell one of them off. They'd kick your [expletive] immediately without getting mad or taking things personally.

They were not conflict averse. They wouldn't even gang up on you necessarily. Beat downs were like a community service the Rats provided. The stranger didn't take his personally. He got back on his feet and apologized, told Firpo that his mom had just died, that he'd been messed up, at his wits end and had not meant to say anything all. Now that he had, he was sorry. I'm sorry about your mother, said Firpo as he guided the man out of the clubhouse.

DAVIES: (Laughter) That's a - this is a remarkable scene, and it's almost as if these guys use violence the way others use language, isn't it?

ABRAMOVICH: That's a beautiful way of putting it. Yeah, it's a form of communication and it's also a form of exchanging affections.

DAVIES: Alex Abramovich is our guest. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, our guest is writer Alex Abramovich. His new book, ""Bullies: A Friendship,"" is about a friendship that he renewed with a kid he'd known from his youth who turns out to have founded a motorcycle club in Oakland. Alex Abramovich spent a lot of time there.

Now, the club, as we read your book, seems less about riding bikes than about fighting. And Trevor organized fight nights at which the public would be invited and he would have people in the boxing ring out back. Initially you say it was just a bunch of couches arranged in a square, but eventually there was a boxing ring. Do you want to describe one of these events for us?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, they sound different than they are to attend. They're fun in real life, although they're bloody and violent. And sometimes they were impromptu. Sometimes people - fights would just break out. But sometimes they were very organized and they would have themes. There was, in fact, the Jews versus Gentiles fight night, which would be a two-man versus two-man fight, so a four-man fight. And it would be over bragging rights for who could name the next holiday party. Would it be a Christmas party or would it be a Hanukkah party. And it was billed as the battle of the sects.

DAVIES: The battle of the sects, OK, S-E-C-T, OK.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. So fliers went out all over town. And there was a series of undercards, so a lot of other people fought before the Jews and the Gentiles got into the ring. And oddly enough, I didn't know that there were too many Jewish bikers out there. I'd never really run into them in New York, but there are a couple. In the ring, the violence was very contained. And the further away you went from the ring, the more violent things got. And sort of once you slipped into the shadows, you'd start seeing really nasty things happening. So at the time that the Jews and the Gentiles are fighting in the ring in the back, out front on San Pablo Avenue some recyclers are maybe getting beaten up for instance.

DAVIES: Recyclers - these are, like, guys who pick up cans to get, you know, food for their habits or whatever, right?

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. I mean, there's a recycling center that's a few blocks from the clubhouse. And it's a source of constant tension in the neighborhood because not only are the recyclers with their shopping carts always clogging up San Pablo Avenue, but there are problems having to do with people's houses getting broken into, tools getting stolen, pipes getting stolen. In fact, the East Bay Rats' clubhouse was broken into while I was there and Trevor's plumbing was stolen.

And then there are also issues having to do with public urination, public defecation, prostitution, drug dealing. And remarkably enough, some of the recyclers seem to think that if they'd break their bags full of bottles - they're sold by weight. So they think that if they break their bags full of bottles they'll weigh more because broken glass weighs more than intact bottles. So there's this constant soundtrack of breaking glass.

DAVIES: You describe an incident that you witnessed between some members of the motorcycle club, the East Bay Rats, and a recycler. You want to tell us about that?

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. So the recyclers are kind of a constant presence and when the Rats drink beer, which they do all the time and in fact there's a soda machine that sells dollar beers in the clubhouse, they'll just toss the empties outside and the empties will be gone within 30 seconds or a minute. And that's their form of recycling.

So at the night of one of the fight nights, there was a recycler who kept hovering right around the door. And usually what'll happen at a fight night or an East Bay Rats party is all of the Rats and people belonging to other clubs will ride up to the clubhouse and park their bikes in a neat line down the length of the block. So it makes for quite a visual. And on one night, I saw there was a recycler who kept darting in in between their legs right outside the clubhouse front door to get the cans, basically, to get empty beer cans.

And, you know, there are often people hanging around the Rats who want to impress them, who want to be prospects for the club. And someone like that was around that evening. And he got up at one point, got up off the motorcycle he was sitting on, walked over to the recycler and shoved him hard into the line of bikes. And, you know, I was holding my breath, and for a minute I thought it was going to be OK, but it wasn't OK. Another Rat came up and touching the bike was enough it turned out. Everyone was drunk and a Rat went up and he knocked the man down to the ground. And then a couple of other Rats came out and they knocked the man to the ground. And San Pablo is a wide avenue. It's four lanes with a big median strip. And the man crawled over - the recycler crawled over the median strip and - onto the oncoming traffic lane. And I turned and I saw one of the Rats flip the visor on his helmet down and he was on his motorcycle and he rode it around the median strip. And he rode it up to the recycler who was lying on the ground at this point bleeding. And he rolled his bike back and forth sort of nudging the recycler a few times with the front tire. And then he gunned it and he rode over the recycler's torso, which was very horrible to watch and horrible to think about and horrible also to think that I could've done something to stop it in real time. And I didn't realize that in real time and didn't do anything to stop it, so not a proud moment for me.

DAVIES: And the recycler survived, got up and walked away?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I turned around and I thought I was going to throw up when I saw them ride over the recycler's body. And when I turned back around, the recycler was gone. I was expecting him to be lying on the cement with broken bones, but he had scampered away. The next time I saw Trevor, Trevor said, you'd be surprised. Crack heads are surprisingly resilient, and I said I wish I could've done something to stop it, and Trevor said you could've. All it takes is someone saying stop.

GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Alex Abramovich about his new book, ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll hear more of the interview after a break. And we'll remember The Beatles' record producer George Martin, who died yesterday at age 90. We'll listen back to an interview I recorded with him about helping shape their early sound and about producing ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Alex Abramovich about his new memoir, ""Bullies: A Friendship."" It's about reconnecting with a guy who'd bullied him when they were kids. When they reconnected, that guy, Trevor, was the head of a motorcycle club in East Oakland called the East Bay Rats, which was known for their bruising and brawling. The book is in part about that subculture.

DAVIES: What was the East Bay Rats' attitude towards racial diversity? I mean, there's - it's a city with a history of some racial issues certainly.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. I didn't know this before I started writing the book, but it turns out that many motorcycle clubs are formed along racial lines. I mean, they form along all sorts of lines. They form along - the police themselves in Oakland have a motorcycle club. In fact, there are two motorcycle clubs associated with the police out there. But well-known national clubs tend to break down along racial lines, and the Rats do not. There are African-American members. There are Jewish members, as I mentioned. There are Mexican-American members. So for the Rats, that's never really been an issue. It's very inclusive in that way. And it's also inclusive sexually I would say. Gays and lesbians are always welcome in the clubhouse. They're welcome in the - at fight nights. It's an interesting question what would happen if an openly gay man were to try to join the Rats. I'm not sure how that would fly. But in terms of people they hang out with, it's absolutely copacetic. So in that sense, the Rats are not - I would say that the Rats are more evolved in certain ways than our present political moment.

DAVIES: And what about their attitude towards women? You know, you hear of motorcycle clubs having women with - wearing things saying that they're the club's property.

ABRAMOVICH: I mean, they're not models of enlightened 21st-century, you know, men. And the gender roles are - tend to be a little old-fashioned maybe by standards employed elsewhere in the Bay Area. There are a couple of young women who hung out with the Rats. Bea (ph) and an Amber (ph) are their names, and they made themselves patches that read East Bay Cats (ph). So they were sort of like the girls auxiliary. But that's not quite the same as saying property of. On the other hand, it's certainly true - and I saw this time and again - that the Rats are both incredibly attractive for and aware of their own attractiveness to certain kinds of women in Oakland. And they take full advantage of that. And the full advantage of that might involve orgies in the back of the bar or the clubhouse. I don't think they really do this anymore. You know, they've aged out of it and they're family men now, but there was a lot of stuff going on in relation to girls.

DAVIES: Were there any stories of rape or sexual abuse of women in the club?

ABRAMOVICH: No. I never heard anything remotely about a rape and I think that I would've. I spent four years with those guys and I spent a lot of that time with people who didn't like those guys, so I would've heard about it. I heard a lot of messed up sexual stories, but nothing that wasn't consensual.

The one thing that happened while I was out there was that at one of the fight nights there was a man that assaulted a young woman. And they were making out and he started choking her and then she was on the ground and then she ran into the clubhouse covered in blood. And she said that this guy had tried to rape her and the Rats came down immediately like avenging angels, and they beat that guy to within an inch of his life. And Trevor said that as I was hitting him I was really sad because I really like this guy but here he was, you know, but then he also felt sad that he didn't break the guy's legs with a shovel.

DAVIES: Because there was a code of some kind.

ABRAMOVICH: The code is - there are rules. They're written down. I wasn't allowed to see them. Prospects aren't even allowed to see them. You're only allowed to see them once you patch in as a member. But I know what some of the rules are, and there are rules governing the treatment of women and the word respect comes up very often. So not only do you not disrespect women when they're around you but you especially respect each other's girlfriends. You have to ask permission before you date someone's ex-girlfriend. As you would imagine, this leads to a certain amount of friction.

DAVIES: You spent some time with the motorcycle club the East Bay Rats when you were writing a magazine article. Then you went back to New York and eventually came back to Oakland with your girlfriend and lived there for quite a while. So you had a lot of experience and spent a lot of time with the guys in the club. What did they think of you?

ABRAMOVICH: They didn't know what to make of me. The first time I met them when I was writing the magazine article, Trevor had told everyone that I was his bully, so they couldn't wait to see the guy who had bullied the president of their motorcycle club. And they were surprised when this, you know, 5-foot-8 guy with glasses stepped out of his rental car.

DAVIES: (Laughter).

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor does not wear glasses and he's well over 6 feet tall. And they did what they would do to anyone that they liked initially - they hazed me. And they put me on a motorcycle on my first full day in Oakland, my first morning in Oakland. And they put me on a motorcycle that I was guaranteed to crash, which I did crash. And I crashed it right away and I crashed it badly. I think they expected a smaller crash, but I crashed it in style. And I broke my hand, but weirdly enough, my hand - I don't know if it was the adrenaline or just the way the nerves are arranged, but for whatever reason my hand didn't hurt until I got back to New York. So instead of going to the hospital, I wrapped it up in boxing tape and I stayed out there for a week, and I kept reporting.

So in a sense we sort of got the hazing out of the way very early and I think that I ended up presenting or appearing as a much braver person than I actually am. If my hand had actually been hurting I would've gone to the hospital. But then the magazine article came out six or seven months later and the Rats liked that very much. They're not criminals, so they don't make any money off the club, so the coin for them is publicity. And they're savvy when it comes to publicity, and this was publicity on a grand national scale, so they liked that a lot.

So the magazine article came out, and it brought them a fair amount of welcome attention, including sexual attention, and they like that. So there was a certain amount of goodwill, I would say, built in by the time I arrived back at the club. But it's a club with, you know, as I said, 35 members and some of them like the cameras and some of them don't like the cameras. And that's a dynamic in and of itself, just having a camera changes what's happening at the clubhouse. So there were Rats that didn't like me at all and probably still don't like me and they pretty much stayed away from me. John Firpo, who we mentioned already, took a very active dislike to me. And John Firpo is a very large and very intimidating, scary dude. And that was unpleasant. John and I got along fine now, but...

DAVIES: Well, I was going to - did you feel afraid ever? I mean, you were there for some long nights with a lot of drinking and I'm sure they got really rowdy. Did you feel afraid?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I didn't feel afraid because I was in - I was working. I was there to take notes. I was drinking sometimes, but I was still working. And there was a sort of circle of safety involved when you were with Trevor. So as long as I stayed within that circle of safety, I felt OK. Now, there were things that happened at the periphery that were not OK and that were scary and frightening and genuinely I would say lightweight dangerous.

DAVIES: Alex Abramovich is our guest. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, we're speaking with writer Alex Abramovich. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" It's about him reconnecting with a kid he'd known from his youth who turns out to have founded a motorcycle club in Oakland. Alex Abramovich spent a lot of time there.

You know, it's interesting. There are places in the book where you have long extended stories quoted verbatim from some of the bikers, particularly Trevor. I assume you carried a tape recorder a lot of the time. And he certainly sounds very well spoken. You do say you wondered at points if he was a sociopath. What made you wonder that?

ABRAMOVICH: Things he did. To give two very brief examples - one was a story that he told me. I picked him up one day. We were going somewhere and he said, you know, it's funny. A crackhead was peeing on my door last night and I opened up the door and there he was. And I took a shovel and, you know, I broke the guy's arm. I could tell I'd broken his arm from the way it was flopping around. But then, you know, I walked inside and I turned on the PlayStation and I was playing ""Star Wars Battlefront"" and I got the highest score I've ever gotten. I thought that was a strange story.

DAVIES: Trevor's life did change over time, right? What's he up to now?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor's got a very heteronormative life now. I mean, it was pretty heteronormative before, but now it's a pretty just normative let's say. He lives in Emeryville now, which is a small town next to Oakland. He moved out of Oakland because everyone is getting priced out of Oakland these days, or as Trevor put it, Oakland's getting nicer and that's great, but if it gets too much nicer, we'll all have to leave. So he left.

He got a job doing outdoor work with the city of Albany, which is another small town nearby that has really good schools that he can send his kids to. And Trevor has two little boys now. He got married. He stopped being a bouncer. At some point, he bought himself a purple Harley-Davidson. These guys all ride very fast Japanese sports bikes that they customize and turn into Rat bikes - what they call them. But Trevor bought this, you know, giant thing out of ""Purple Rain"" with a CD player, which he's since gotten rid of. Even that was too much for him. But he's got a - Trevor's very wily and he's sort of set himself up with the life that he wants and on the surface at least it looks pretty much like, you know, this American life.

DAVIES: And is there less violence in his life?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I never saw Trevor - Trevor got into fights while I was there at the bar, but I never saw Trevor inside the ring. I never actually saw him box. He and I sparred together. He taught me how to box, but I never saw him that directly involved in violence. Now he's not a bouncer at the club anymore, so that takes that whole part out of the equation. They still have fight nights, and the club's actually thriving now. It was in a bit of a lull when I was out there.

So on the one hand, he's surrounded by violence, but on the other hand, you know, he's also a father now. And he told me a funny story just this week actually. They were having a fight night and his boy Mason (ph) was there. And Mason's about 2-and-a-half, maybe going on 3 now. And Mason had seen lots of boxing and ultimate fighting on TV and he'd seen people spar at the clubhouse, but he'd never seen an actual fight. And now people are fighting in the boxing ring. And these were people that he knows and loves and cares about and they're hurting each other and they're getting hurt. And Trevor looked down at Mason and he thought, oh, my God, am I one of those parents? What am I exposing my kid to? And before he could do anything, Mesa looked up at his mom and handed her his dinosaurs and ran into the clubhouse. And Trevor - you know, Trevor went after him and he was expecting to find Mason in the corner crying, but instead Trevor said Mason was in there hitting the heavy bag.

DAVIES: Wow (laughter). How well do you feel that you know him? I mean, are you good friends now? Do you feel like you understand him?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, he's my oldest friend, I think. I've known him for 30 - is that right - 35 years now and I'm only 43. And I'm his oldest friend. So in a sense there's a very deep connection and whenever we don't see each other for a while, we pick up the thread very quickly. As far as understanding him, I think my understanding of him is contained in that I can sort of walk around him and describe him. And I think I did a pretty good job of it in the book of describing how he comes across, how his very, very unusual mind works. But in terms of really, really going in there and untangling the motivations, yeah, you know, the short answer is I do think I get it and I think I described it. He functions under tremendous internal pressures and he has absorbed a great deal of poison and he's gotten better and better at with every passing year at lancing that poison and finding productive ways to - or at least non-self-destructive ways to let seep back out into the world.

DAVIES: Well, Alex Abramovich, thanks so much for speaking with us.

ABRAMOVICH: Thanks so much, Dave. It was a pleasure.

GROSS: Alex Abramovich is the author of the new memoir ""Bullies: A Friendship."" He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies, who is also WHYY's senior reporter. Coming up, we remember George Martin who produced 13 albums by The Beatles. He died yesterday. We'll listen back to my interview with him about working with The Beatles. This is FRESH AIR.

Some people in the line were not sure what to do with their phones. A man in his mid-50s, who'd traveled all the way from Kansas with his sister, thought it would be fine to keep his hidden away in his pocket. He had no intention of using it, he said. But he's been diagnosed with cancer and, understandably, was a little anxious about being uncontactable for several hours, so far away from home in the depths of Minnesota.

""You use it, you lose it!"" bellowed Paisley Park staff as we waited at a local bus station to receive our wristbands and be transported in coaches to the venue. Holders of VIP tickets ($250) were allowed to park at Paisley. But however much you'd paid for a ticket, one rule was being enforced above all others: no cellphones, no cameras. There were quite a few locals in the friendly, mostly middle-aged crowd, people who'd been to Paisley many times. They were unequivocal. ""Don't bother bringing a phone,"" said Sean, who was dressed in a purple suit. ""They'll take it off you."" I locked mine in the rental car, away from temptation. Most others did the same, including the gentleman from Kansas. Prince, armed with just a microphone and a piano, was playing a couple of intimate midweek shows in one night, in his own studio complex just outside Minneapolis.

""From all over the world, the people came,"" brags Prince's last great B-side, before the Internet changed the way we think of singles. The song is called ""Rock 'n' Roll is Alive (And It Lives In Minneapolis),"" and on a cold night in January, both the opening lyric and the title of this 1995 track still seemed to hold true. Given Prince's notoriously antagonistic relationship with the Internet, it is not a surprise that this song is unavailable to legally stream or download anywhere.

There are probably two main reasons for the cellphone ban at Paisley Park. First is an attempt to preserve the purity of the live music experience, to encourage people to watch and absorb the show rather than their screens. Apart from a woman who used her phone flashlight to look for something she'd dropped, earning a stern word from an alert member of staff, everyone seemed to respect the rules. At one point, while he scrolled through his iPad, deciding what to play next, Prince playfully asked why everyone was looking at him. Later, I could only find a single, blurry image from the show on social media.

The other reason is Prince's fierce commitment to protection of copyright. He does not take kindly to unauthorized recordings and images. There is surprisingly little to be found in places like YouTube. What does exist is usually unauthorized and only survives for as long as it takes to issue a takedown notice. Which Prince, or whoever he's paying to handle this task, does with great regularity. There is plenty of Prince material on non-U.S. video sites, which are harder to deal with under American law.

""Copyright law has not caught up with the way the Internet works,"" explains Professor Chris Bavitz of Harvard Law School. ""The Internet itself is premised on making copies. Every time you load a web page you are making a copy. But technically, according to the U.S. Copyright Act, you are violating the rights of whoever owns the content on that page.""

Bavitz has been immersed in the music industry for many years. Between 2003 and 2008 he was in-house counsel at EMI, at the time one of the four major record labels. Among other things, he now teaches a Music and Digital Media class at Harvard.

Today, relatively few people buy physical copies of music. After its slow initial response to the rise of illegal file-sharing in the 2000s, the industry now supplies music in several ways using the Internet. You can pay to download individual tracks and albums using something like iTunes; you can stream music of your choice by subscribing to a service like Spotify; you can select a genre or artist on Pandora and let the service's algorithm choose similar songs for you. Artists also have their own channels on audio and video platforms like Soundcloud and YouTube, to which fans can subscribe for free. But Prince has mostly stood apart from these developments.

""The Internet's completely over,"" he said in 2010. ""I don't see why I should give my new music to iTunes or anyone else."" Since then, Prince has removed most of his music from the streaming service Spotify, instead aligning with the newer, smaller, Jay-Z-backed Tidal. There is some music available on iTunes, but the latest releases appear several weeks earlier on Tidal. There are many Prince songs and albums that are completely unavailable on any of the major digital platforms.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), an important civil liberty organization that specifically focuses on digital technology, created The Raspberry Beret Lifetime Aggrievement Award for Prince, in 2013, because of his ""extraordinary abuses of the takedown process in the name of silencing speech."" It sees Prince's takedowns not merely as a copyright issue, in which an artist can claim to be protecting his work, but as outright censorship.

In 2007, Stephanie Lenz posted a 29-second video of her young children dancing in the kitchen. Faintly in the background, the Prince song ""Let's Go Crazy"" is playing. The correct response would probably have been to do nothing, but Universal Music, Prince's label at the time, decided to issue a takedown. The ensuing legal battle, in which the EFF represents Lenz, is still not quite over after nine long years of decisions and appeals. Though he's not the plaintiff, the EFF still blames Prince.

The association is understandable. That same year, Prince not only threatened legal action against eBay and YouTube but also against three websites that were run by his fans. He wanted them to remove anything linked to his likeness: photos, album art, even images of Prince-inspired tattoos. A letter from his lawyers asked them to provide ""substantive details of the means by which you propose to compensate our clients [Paisley Park Entertainment Group, NPG Records and AEG] for damages."" In response, the fansites formed a coalition, Prince Fans United, to contest the action. Prince then created a one-off website where he uploaded an unflattering song about them, the frankly awesome ""PFunk."" In the end, nobody got sued and pretty much everyone loved the track. ""With everything that's going on, we continue to listen to his music,"" said Karen Avera from the Housequake fansite, at the time. ""We'll continue to buy his music, because we appreciate his music."" But it was an ugly episode, nonetheless.

Infamously, Prince managed to take down a YouTube clip of himself performing a cover of Radiohead's ""Creep"" at the Coachella music festival in 2008, despite the band's lead singer Thom Yorke making it very clear who the song actually belongs to. The law does not provide a great deal of clarity in these cases, unfortunately.

""My guess is that Prince at least claimed to be an owner or co-owner of the rights in this video, even if not the song, thus giving him the right to demand its removal,"" says Bavitz. ""But, actually parsing out the basis for that claim is a bit messy."" The video was uploaded yet again last year, this time apparently with Prince's approval. He's now using Twitter and Instagram again and posted a link to it.

YouTube

Among his devoted fans, who have vast collections of Prince albums and have seen him live many times, there is a general acceptance of this stance. They don't worry too much about the lack of grainy clips on YouTube or the absence of music on Spotify.

Some I met at Paisley Park shook their heads in weary resignation as they muttered, ""Yeah, he hates the Internet.""

Amanda Palmer certainly does not hate the Internet. The singer/songwriter is famous for her personal interactions with fans, both on and offline. She has more than a million Twitter followers; she takes the time to answer many of their questions and generally engage in conversation; she allows all photography and filming at her live shows. This is pretty much the opposite of Prince's approach. Palmer has built such a rapport with fans that she managed to raise $1.2 million on the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter, to support a tour and the recording of a 2012 album. This was not without some controversy, with a few musicians upset about her calls for volunteers to play on some songs alongside her main band.

Palmer grew up idolizing Prince. But the music industry has changed since the days when she had posters of him on her bedroom wall. She makes an analogy with the silent movie stars who, brilliant as they may have been, could not cope with the inevitability of a technological revolution that would pass them by. Prince was successful in an era of lucrative music sales  and, to be fair, patient support from a major record label  that has now largely gone. ""What Prince wants is just not possible anymore,"" she says. ""But it is important that people don't hold it against him. He grew up and is completely fluent in a language that is dying. Almost all of my early heroes are struggling in the same way.""

But it is not clear that technology is the main issue here. Even before the Internet came along, Prince was trying to control the distribution of his music. At the Paisley Park concert, many people were exchanging stories of how and where they got hold of old bootleg Prince recordings. This is how an artist like Prince truly endures, how dedicated fandom develops. For these people, Purple Rain is for the masses.

For an obsessive teenage music fan, an artist's official back catalog is rarely sufficient. In London in the early 1990s, a few of us would pick up the Northern Line from Kings Cross and make the short journey to Camden Town. There, in the famous, sprawling market surrounding by indie-music pubs full of underage drinkers, we'd head for the music stalls to look for unofficial tracks, concert recordings, demos, whatever we could get our hands on. I still have a poor-quality vinyl pressing of the once-legendary Black Album.

Very early on a sunny morning in 1994, a small group of us once again headed to Camden. Not, this time, to buy more tapes in the market, but because Prince was actually opening his own store there. He wasn't even called Prince that day, because he had changed his name to a symbol and was in the middle of a fight to extract himself from his contract at Warner Brothers. A few dozen people were waiting patiently. Presumably they'd also been mocked at school. My mum had made sandwiches.

At its peak, the crowd was no bigger than a couple of hundred. Bear in mind this was one of the most famous people in the world just showing up in a popular, touristy part of London. But we had no Internet access, no cellphones, no digital cameras. We only knew about it because one of us subscribed to a photocopied, crudely stapled fanzine. Today, social media would force the police to shut the whole thing down. Eventually, Prince himself appeared on the balcony, wearing a bright yellow jumpsuit. He cut a ribbon, waved for a few seconds, the crowd went nuts and he was gone. I bought posters, some CDs and regrettably, a large earring in the shape of the Prince symbol.

Sadly, there are very few records of that day  a Google search only reveals a few poor quality photos and a very early online forum discussion with about four participants. The store closed down two years later, but it was an early attempt by Prince to bypass established music industry distribution channels.

My old friend Sidh Solanki was with us that morning. An extremely talented musician even as a teenager, he has since forged a successful career as a producer and is now based in Los Angeles. Solanki, despite his deep roots in the industry, does not listen to music on Spotify or any other streaming service, partly because he feels it doesn't compensate music creators properly. ""These people have been pumping music out to their subscribers for years without paying people for their copyrights,"" he says. ""Prince has a lot to be wary of when he puts music out there.""

Nobody thought the music royalties system was completely fair in the old days, but Solanki suggests that it was at least straightforward. The record label would manage the process and he got a certain amount every time someone bought a record or it got played on the radio. But now, he thinks they have changed listeners' expectations. ""Music is now freely available everywhere so it has no value to the consumer,"" he says.

A recent report from the Berklee School of Music in Boston is highly critical of the streaming services and their investors, who happen to include major record labels. Essentially, the report accuses the music industry of a deliberate lack of transparency. The technology exists to track downloads and streams to a very fine degree, something that would enable artists to see what they are owed and help create a common standard. It might not make everyone rich but it would at least be fair. But the industry chooses not to use technology that is easily available, so we now have, the report says, ""a tremendously mismatched ecosystem in which we have surface-level, profit-generating elements without the proper digital infrastructure to support them.""

""The resulting opaque industry,"" it concludes starkly, ""is one in which many artists can reach a wide number of fans, but only a few can truly make a living from their craft, and even fewer can understand the problems they are facing.""

Prince probably does not need to earn a living any more. He can charge $250 a ticket for a concert in his house. But Solanki still approves of his attempts to control distribution and experiment with new methods of getting his music and brand out there, which includes that London store more than twenty years ago. ""Prince is just doing what he thinks is best,"" he says. ""We have maybe a few years before we figure out the norms for where we get our music from and how we all get paid properly. There isn't a solution yet. Because if he hasn't found it, no-one's found it.""

Towards the end of Prince's most commercially successfully period, Galaxie 500, a critically-acclaimed indie rock band, formed at Harvard in the late eighties. Damon Krukowski, the band's soft-spoken drummer, says the three musicians who had made up the group took a major hit with the rise of digital music services. They used to make a clear profit on physical records sold and a successful album could generate enough income to live on for a while, even though they accepted early on that they were never going to be selling millions. Streaming not only killed off the idea of a back catalog as a chronology of music, but dramatically reduced their income.

Prince, says Krukowski, has thought harder about the industry than other musicians. He is entrepreneurial and ambitious. ""Prince was always destined to be a pop star and had his eye on being huge,"" he says. ""But he would show up and watch these obscure bands that only other musicians liked, in tiny venues in Minneapolis. He always wanted to know everything that was going on.""

Krukowski thinks artists should abandon the idea of expecting fans to pay to stream their music and just offer that particular service for free. They could still sell downloads on iTunes and elsewhere. In his view, it would be fairer and more practical for digital streams to ""flow freely  from everyone, fans included  instead of only from companies that have cut deals with the copyright holders."" That way, at least everyone is on a level playing field. ""I believe if we relinquish control and claim over the stream,"" he says. ""We clarify what it is we actually do own and can profit from as musicians and songwriters.""

For emerging artists today, there is an acceptance that streaming services in their current form, however unfair their business practices might seem when it comes to royalties, cannot be ignored. The Internet in general offers an enormous opportunity to reach audiences  and generate revenue from elsewhere  at a scale that was once impossible without the backing of a record label. Prince was 18 when Warner Brothers gave him a multi-album deal, even allowing the precocious teenager to produce his own albums. It was not until his fifth effort, 1999, that he could be considered a major star. His sixth, incidentally, was Purple Rain. This level of patience and support was unusual at the time but it would not happen at all today.

Dani Leigh was also just 18 when Prince invited her to direct the video for his ""Breakfast Can Wait"" single in 2013. Two years later, as one half of the duo Curly Fryz, the Florida native performed on the standout track of a recent Prince album, a storming piece of braggadocio funk called ""Like A Mack."" As a new solo artist, she says she is lucky to have Prince in her corner. But unlike her mentor, she is not in a position to shun the Internet. Her first single is available on every platform. ""That's where everyone gets their music nowadays,"" she says. ""It's easier for Prince to do what he does, because he's Prince. A lot of people will go out of their way to find his music.""

He still refuses to back down. ""I was right about [the Internet],"" Prince said in November 2015. Leigh worries about his legacy among a new generation of music fans, because of his absence from Spotify and YouTube. ""I know a lot of younger kids who don't know Prince and don't realize who he is,"" she says.

Although nobody else of his status behaves this way today, a decade ago, just before he started threatening to sue everyone in sight, Prince was considered a genuine Internet hero: ""It is with great pleasure and admiration that we present The Webby Lifetime Achievement award to Prince, who has forever altered the landscape of online musical distribution as the first major artist to release an entire album  1997's Crystal Ball  exclusively on the web. Prince's leadership online has transformed the entertainment industry and reshaped the relationship between artist and fan.""

From the very beginning, Prince had always been interested in computers and how an artist might use them, says Berklee professor and Prince fan Ben Houge. Songs like ""Something In The Water (Does Not Compute)"" (1982) and ""Computer Blue"" (1984) were early examples right there in his music; in the Internet era there are tracks like ""Emale"" and ""My Computer"" (both 1996). The latter's lyrics are even prescient of social media: ""I scanned my computer, looking for a site. Somebody to talk to, funny and bright.""

Later, he used the available technology to create ""experiences,"" not merely albums, that were more than just music, combining sound, visuals and a sense of interactivity. The liner notes for 1997's Crystal Ball, specifically cited by the Webby Awards, were presented as a web page, which was unique at the time. Professor Houge argues that Prince is sensitive to everything that is part of a musical experience. ""Of course it's incredibly convenient to have music instantly accessible on a streaming service, but so much information is lost,"" he says. ""Not only textual information like credits, lyrics, bios and essays but also visual information like photos, font, layout and graphic design, so many things that convey an important extra-musical dimension to an artist's vision.""

In 2001, Prince launched his most ambitious Internet project of all, the NPG Music Club, a subscription service that was initially priced at $100 a year. It was an attempt to distribute exclusive new music directly to fans and give members first preference and VIP access to concerts. It also featured a weekly, fan-hosted radio show. It didn't always work very well. Eventually, the price was lowered to just $25 for a lifetime membership, so I too signed up. I never got a VIP pass to a concert.

The site closed down in 2006, the same year Prince won the lifetime Webby. There has never been a prince.com, a consistent, high-quality Internet home. Someone has registered the domain but there is no website. Prince has instead had a series of short-lived sites, dating all the way back to thedawn.com in 1996. Most of them were designed to sell a specific album or event and none lasted very long. He periodically dips in and out of social media.

This is not the only musical genius to have tried, with limited success, to use the Internet and realize its potential for music. ""Peace, David Bowie,"" said Prince, quietly and a little unexpectedly, as he was sitting at his piano at Paisley Park. ""I only met him once. He was nice to me. Seems like he was nice to everyone."" It was a gentle, humble moment.

In 1994, Bowie was the first major artist to release a song solely on the Internet, was also into interactive experiences, and by 1998, had gone a lot further than Prince by launching his own service provider, Bowienet, which offered Internet access, a Bowienet email address and an official, high-quality Bowie website that was full of music and visual material. By 2002, Bowie had accepted that the Internet would change the way musicians functioned. ""I'm fully confident that copyright, for instance, will no longer exist in 10 years, and authorship and intellectual property is in for such a bashing,"" he told The New York Times. ""You'd better be prepared for doing a lot of touring because that's really the only unique situation that's going to be left.""

Bowie was wrong about the demise of copyright but right about the increased value of live performances. In the 2000s, Prince did not sell many records but was one of the highest-grossing live acts in the world. In 1996, following his debilitating battle with Warners  the era of the unpronounceable symbol for a name and ""slave"" written on his face  the comedian Chris Rock had also told Prince to just get on the stage. ""You talk about owning your music,"" said Rock. ""The thing you have that is worth more than anything else is your reputation as a live performer, which will feed you when all else fails.""

Prince's entire history with the Internet can be understood in terms of a great artist experimenting with available technology to retain control of his music and artistic vision, trying to maintain a separation between live performance and recordings, and achieving a business model that rewards artists for their work and talent. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, an era of largely open platforms  before iTunes, Spotify, social media  what he wanted to achieve might have seemed possible. But neither the NPG Music Club nor Bowienet were suited to the way the Internet was changing and, looking back, it is perhaps no surprise they were both finished by 2006. Ultimately, Houge thinks Prince has tried really hard: ""I think his issues with the Internet, relatively recent in his long-term relationship with the medium, are more a result of disappointment of the ways in which its potential has not been realized than in a lack of vision.""

It was approaching 2:00 a.m. when the lights went up and we were gently ushered to the heated coaches that would return us to our cars a couple of miles away. It was cold outside and there was light snow. ""There aren't any rules in Paisley Park,"" Prince had sung, but many would beg to differ.

For nearly four hours, the performances were perfect, with just one or two songs repeated across the two concerts. Prince was relaxed and funny, and played the obscure songs this crowd craved, as well as some of the bigger hits. There are nearly 40 albums to choose from. For many fans, it is not an overstatement to describe this as a pilgrimage, a visit to the birthplace of the soundtrack to their lives. Prince's staff filmed the performance but it is likely that the footage will end up in his semi-mythical vault, where it is thought he stores thousands of recordings that very few people have heard.

On the Internet, meanwhile, there is that solitary unauthorized photo on Instagram and nothing at all of this concert on YouTube. If you want to see the show, to have the memories, you have to buy a ticket. The Internet can do great things for music but it still cannot replicate an experience like this.",[]

When she was 17, Tracey Helton Mitchell was prescribed an opioid pain killer after getting her wisdom teeth extracted. The medicine helped her deal with the pain related to the extraction, but when the prescription ran out, her desire for its euphoric high remained. That's when she turned to heroin.

As a teenager, Mitchell imagined heroin to be glamorous, but she found it wasn't once she became an addict. She tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that the drug ruined her health and her self-esteem. She lived in an alley, shot drugs into the bottom of her feet, sold her body for money and was jailed several times. She was also featured in a 1999 documentary about addicts called Black Tar Heroin.

At one of her lowest points, Mitchell says, ""I was having heart palpitations, because I was using stimulants, and I thought, 'They're going to pull me out of this hotel, I have no ID, my parents, my family ... will never know that I died and I'll just be a Jane Doe and this is how I'm going to expire in this place.' ""

But Mitchell didn't die from her addiction. Rather, with the help of the nondenominational 12-step program LifeRing and other support groups and therapies, she eventually stopped using and became a certified addiction specialist. She has been clean for 18 years.

In her new memoir, The Big Fix, Mitchell writes about her addiction and her path to recovery, and also shares insights into today's heroin epidemic. When it comes to our current treatment system, Mitchell says we would do better to reach out to addicts as individuals, by recognizing each user's unique needs and motivations.

Our current method of treatment is ""sort of a one-size-[fits]-all approach,"" she says. ""We need to have a variety of different kinds of treatment interventions that address people's needs.""

Interview Highlights

On what it's like to watch Black Tar Heroin now that she's clean

It can be painful to watch, especially when I think about my life now and I contrast that. ... My legs did look like I was dropped in a dumpster and picked out by rats. I had, I think, 34 or 36 abscesses. I have scars that have healed, but I had to have surgeries on some and in the summertime when everybody else is wearing shorts and stuff like that, I see those things  even right now sitting here at the table I can see one of the scars on my arms. It's a good thing in that it reminds me of where I was, but then it's also very challenging, because this documents a very unpleasant part of my life that can't be changed.

On why she agreed to be filmed

I really believed that I was going to die, or be murdered. There was lots of evidence to make me feel that way, and I wanted it to be something that people would see after I was dead that showed that heroin was not the glamorous thing that I had thought it was when I was a teenager and had imagined it. I wasn't paid for the film; it was a huge inconvenience in my life, but I feel like it still is sort of my legacy to the world, because it's something that's watched today. Millions of people still watch it.

On black tar heroin in the '90s versus heroin today

There's still tar heroin. The heroin that most people get today is much, much stronger. We didn't have to worry about fentanyl  of us dropping dead from an overdose, because no one cut it with fentanyl. The thing that we really worried about was getting flesh-eating [bacteria, necrotizing fasciitis] ... or getting some kind of wound botulism or getting abscesses. There certainly were overdoses then. You could get arrested for overdosing and a lot of people were rolled out at the hospitals or left outside to die ... but there wasn't this culture of heroin where heroin is prevalent absolutely everywhere. It was more localized to big cities, more urban areas.

On 'hitting bottom'

i toggle caption Michael Kerner Photography/Seal Press Michael Kerner Photography/Seal Press

I don't believe in the concept of a bottom. I think that if the opposite of addiction is connection, that addicts or people who use drugs are really seeking out  they need some kind of connection with people. And I would say I've had a wide variety of bottoms, but I wasn't ready to stop until I started to believe that there was a possibility that I actually could stop and saw reasons for myself to stop, and my motivation is totally different.

On being ready to get clean

One of the myths about addiction is that you come to this incredible moment of clarity and that you decide that you're going to stop. And so over the course of my using I had various moments of clarity and I had various points where I had wanted to stop, but they were not always congruent with my opportunities.

So there [were] very few opportunities where I really could truly try to stop, but I would stop using for a few days, I'd try to kick on my own, I'd switch to different drugs, I'd move to different places. I tried different things to stop, but I wasn't completely ready, because all these different traumas had accumulated in my life, and I wasn't prepared to deal with the emotional consequences of all these different things. And that's what to me being off drugs meant  was that I would have to then figure out how I was going to fix all these things on my own. And it wasn't until I got an idea that maybe other people would help me, talking to my mother, knowing that I would have some kind of emotional support where I'd start seeing [that] maybe I don't have to totally do all of this on my own.

On needle exchange programs

At the time there was no needle exchange at all [in Cincinnati] and so you would use the same syringe over and over again and hopefully it didn't break off in your arm. Until the numbers wore off of it, you would sharpen it on a matchbook, and it was just horrible; it was like a rusty nail sticking in your arm.

So I came to San Francisco and they had needle exchanges, which was a revelation, because so many people in the country were suffering from HIV and AIDS, particularly AIDS, because there was no anti-retrovirals. ... So the syringe exchange people provided me education about my drug use. ...

I've seen in my life so many examples of where not having a clean syringe never stopped anyone. I've seen people pick them up out of the gutters. Even here in San Francisco, where there's a lot of access, people break open sharps containers that they've stolen from hospitals because they needed a syringe and they don't have one. ... It doesn't stop people. All it does is spread a public health crisis.

On harm reduction and the argument that harm reduction enables users

My answer is, you can't get clean if you're dead, so there has to be harm reduction. We're not encouraging people to do anything, we're taking a look at their public health behaviors and then addressing what the particular needs are, so look at the cost of one syringe versus the cost of someone getting hepatitis C and having to take care of them for a lifetime.

Look at the public health cost of various other medical conditions that a person can have. From not using sterile water or alcohol pads, someone having endocarditis or some other infection, so having a safe system for people to take care of themselves and treating addicts, users not just addicts, there's plenty of people who use who are not necessarily considered on the spectrum of drug addicts, treating people humanely and having them have access to public health services and the things that they need.

On coping with depression since becoming clean

Part of the reason why I wanted to write The Big Fix is because I felt like there's no ... real education on long-term recovery about what really happens over time. So dealing with topics like untreated depression and anxiety and all the other kind of things that you go through when you take the drugs away, and then you have new issues, because before you use drugs, you didn't have all these guilty, shameful things that you ... now have to deal with, if you're a person like me and you get off drugs.

So I've had a very complicated relationship with my emotions in the past 18 years that I've been clean. I've dealt with very serious post-traumatic stress disorder, being very checked out and dissociative at various points, having to deal with the constant specter of depression, every once in a while having suicidal thoughts. And one of the things that I try to do is really normalize those feelings when people want to know what recovery is really like. It's like, some days you really feel crappy. You really have some things that are going on with you, and I think the prevalent idea is that you get clean and everything is supposed to be great. ... You can have a great life and still not feel all that great.",[]

i LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR

The Internet has not killed the book.

For film critic David Denby, this wasn't immediately obvious. He would watch young people hunched over their phones  on the subway, in coffee shops, walking down the street  and wonder: Are kids still learning to read books?

Denby, who is best known for his work in The New Yorker, went back to high school to find out. He describes his experience in Lit Up: One Reporter. Three Schools. Twenty-Four Books That Can Change Lives.

He followed three high school English classes for a full year: a 10th-grade class at The Beacon School in Manhattan, Mamaroneck High School near New York City and James Hillhouse High School in New Haven, Conn.

Seated on a table in the back of a New York classroom  pushing copies of Shakespeare and Herman Hesse out of the way to make space for himself Denby learned that schools can absolutely still teach kids to love literature.

I asked him to talk about some of his discoveries. Here's our conversation, edited for length:

Why did you only look at three schools, and why did you look at the students in those schools so intensely?

I dislike this American metric prejudice whereby no assertion can be considered of any value unless it's backed up with statistics, surveys, probabilities. Particularly in the education world.

We're talking about young people becoming adults. Becoming themselves. Becoming souls. Becoming conscious. And I don't see how that's measurable.

And I was sick of failure.

I was sick of almost the pornographic reveling in American ineptitude. I wanted to see something that worked.

I didn't want to write a handbook for teachers. I didn't want to write a survey. I wanted to follow one organic development of a class.

I chose Beacon because someone told me about the school. I found that this was a very interesting class because this guy, Sean Leon, was asking students questions that challenged them, I don't know how else to put it, existentially. I mean, they were reading Dostoyevsky and Herman Hesse and Vonnegut, and Faulkner and Hawthorne and so on.

The books that they read tended, with his help, to focus attention to these questions: Who are you? Why do you live? Where are you going? What are you doing?

You know, if you take a typically sarcastic, joking, self-deprecating, media-hip American teenager and scratch him two or three times, you'll find this sort of earnestly questing person underneath. That's what he did.

So, not every school is Beacon ...

Hillhouse is a large inner-city school ... a very different environment.

The kids had strength of feeling and perception. What they weren't, was eager readers.

At the beginning of the year, these were 15- and 16-year-olds, African-American kids, they weren't willing to do the reading at all. The teacher would give them an assignment and they would come in the next day and be blank about it. They couldn't see, particularly the boys, the point of reading in English class. What was it going to do for them?

So that was what Jessica Zylenski, the teacher [at Hillhouse], was trying to engage with and, if necessary, break down.

It's funny to me because, you explicitly said that your book is not a handbook. But the Hillhouse chapters, they do tend to focus on techniques that teachers might use.

The issue always was: How do you get them started?

They read To Kill A Mockingbird, which may seem an odd choice. In other words, they read about poor white people in Alabama in 1930. She wanted them, however, to go from those lives to their own life. From how people lived then to how they lived in New Haven in the 21st century.

So initially they were unwilling to read and they started reading in class together, and then she started moving them to other things. They tried a little Shakespeare. A little Melville. They loved stories by Vonnegut and Hemingway. By the end of the year, they were choosing among four books. And she plunged them into difficult and tragic material because that was what seemed real to them.

I want to pivot back to Sean Leon's class. He always seems to see them right where they are and get them where they need to go.

Well, I know I could never be a teacher.

To be a great teacher, you have to be in touch with what 15 or 20 or, in Sean Leon's case, 32 teenagers are feeling at any one moment.

He has that sixth or seventh sense of where the kids are and how far he can push them. He would plunge into a text, play them off against each other. He never just sat down, laid down the law.

He would pull them out of their defensiveness and get them to perform. Jump from the text and to bring it right into the center of their lives.

I am always bothered by people saying, ""Technology is the worst thing that could happen to the world."" But that's not what you do here.

Exactly. I mean, who am I to say that only literature matters and only books matter? I spent 45 years as a movie critic.

I am addicted to email. I use Facebook and so on. I'm on the Web for all sorts of information. But I also love best to read, and I feel I have to pull back.

He [teacher Sean Leon] was saying you've got to have yourself. You've got to have your family. You've got to have conversation. Movies are fine. The Internet is incredibly useful. But don't think you're going to find yourself there. You may find certain reflections of yourself, but you cannot find your soul there.

In the book, Leon's students wind up doing a pretty good analysis of the hypocrisy of the show Teen Mom. It's almost like he's saying: ""It's fine to be watching TV, but think critically about it.""

I mean, it's an enormously powerful critical tool, reading literature and addressing the world. It's not simple lessons, of course. And it doesn't happen overnight. It's incremental. It happens over your entire life.

All of life is an education.",[]
npr.org,2010-07-18 00:00:00,Is One-Year Anniversary Redundant?,['Ben Zimmer'],"Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Neale Gifford writes: ""One practice that annoys me is the use of 'one-year anniversary' or 'five-year anniversary' instead of 'first' or 'fifth.' Reason? Anniversary is derived from the Latin annus meaning 'year.' "" Ed Morman writes of ""n-year anniversary,"" ""It's not very mellifluous and it is, of course redundant. Help me bring back 'nth anniversary.' ""



Gifford and Morman aren't alone in their irritation. A few years ago, when The San Francisco Chronicle ran a headline reading, ""Four-year anniversary draws protests,"" an irate reader left a profanity-riddled voicemail that unkindly insinuated what substance could be found between the ears of Phil Bronstein, then the editor of The Chronicle. (The same reader was even more offended by the appearance of ""pilotless drone"" in the newspaper, and his recorded rant became something of a Web sensation.)



The New York Times, too, is hardly immune to this redundancy. The June 28 edition, for instance, featured an article on Dylan Ratigan's ""one-year anniversary at MSNBC"" and another stating that New York's first gay pride parade commemorated ""the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall uprising."" Philip Corbett, the newsroom's style guru, has frequently complained about this usage in his ""After Deadline"" blog but laments that his reminders have ""little effect.""



What has happened to the word anniversary? Even though the idea of yearly recurrence is built into the word etymologically, that idea has been clouded over centuries of use. And when an element of a word's meaning becomes more opaque, redundancy is one method, however inelegant, that gets used to unmuddy the waters.

As the annual aspect has moved to the background of anniversary, the shift has opened the door for use of the term to mark the passing of shorter units of time. The 11th edition of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, in its entry for the word, states that anniversary can refer more broadly to a date following a notable event ""by a specified period of time measured in units other than years,"" giving the example, ""the 6-month anniversary of the accident.""



Linguists call this process ""semantic bleaching"": the lessening of a word's force through generalization. The bleaching of anniversary has been going on for quite a while, even if dictionaries are only now catching up. For more than a century, English speakers have been modifying anniversary with numbers of days, weeks or months. An article in the May 5, 1901, Atlanta Constitution described the Vanderbilt family's Biltmore mansion in North Carolina, where little Cornelia Stuyvesant Vanderbilt ""celebrated the three-months anniversary of her birth by planting out a tree on the estate."" A few years later, The San Jose Evening News reported on the unseemly nature of a widow marrying on ""the third-month anniversary of her husband's death.""



Anniversary has been pressed into service for nonannual commemorations in part because English has no other commonly used terms that can fill the gap. At various times since the 19th century, the monthly equivalent of anniversary has been dubbed a mensiversary, using the Latin root mensis for ""month,"" but this ad-hoc coinage has never caught on. (Members of the Facebook group ""Make 'Mensiversary' a Word"" continue to fight the good fight.) A more recent suggestion is the clunky English-Latin hybrid monthiversary.



With pressure on anniversary to expand its reach to subannual units, it's no wonder that ""nth anniversary"" can somehow feel insufficient for traditional yearly celebrations, in need of the more explicit form, ""n-year anniversary."" But if you don't want to see the meaning of the word weakened any further, stick to the ""nth"" version and trust that others will have the good sense to discern anniversary's annualness.",[]
npr.org,,Warning: This Post Contains Language That May Offend; Such Words Should Not Be Used In Podcasts Or On The Air,[],"Warning: This Post Contains Language That May Offend; Such Words Should Not Be Used In Podcasts Or On The Air

There was a good discussion this week among correspondents and editors in the New York bureau about whether we can use some offensive language in podcasts that we cant on the air.

The immediate question was this (NOTE: sensitive readers may find the next sentence objectionable):

Can we call an asshole an asshole?

The answer was no, we dont want an NPR correspondent to say that on a podcast.

The process, by the way, worked. A correspondent consulted his editor. The editor consulted his boss and the Standards & Practices noodge. A case was made, consideration was given and a decision was reached that everyone understood.

This is a good time to ask: How do we feel about offensive language in podcasts?

As an organization, we respect our audience and set a high bar on use of language that may be offensive.

That line was originally written about what we say on the air, but we made clear three years ago when the Ethics Handbook was published that the bar applies to our other platforms as well:

Online, if sound or text containing potentially offensive language has been approved for use by a Managing Editor or someone above that level, it too must be preceded by text (and in the case of audio, a verbal warning as well) advising the NPR.org audience that what follows contains language some may find offensive.

The environment is changing quickly. Some very popular podcasts do not worry about whether their language might offend. Their hosts conversational and sometimes profane ways of speaking are probably pulling in far more listeners than they repel.

We dont want to seem boring and out-of-step. We do want to sound like America. But, the bar that NPR journalists need to get over before using such language themselves has to be set incredibly high  so high, in fact, that its almost impossible to get over.

Were professional communicators at a major news organization. What we say and write in public reflects on NPR. No matter what platform were using or where were appearing, we should live up to our own standards. Yes, theres more room in podcasts to let guests speak freely and for our journalists to be looser with their language. But it doesnt mean NPR correspondents are free to use words or phrases in podcasts that they would never use on the air.

We should always be the news outlet that revels in language. There are so many wonderful words. Use them!

The most common offensive words and phrases are among the least creative ways of expressing yourself. Theyre akin to cliches in the sense that theyre easy ways out. We pride ourselves on using words that pop out because theyre funny, provocative, rarely heard or just perfect. Again, use them!

You may be asking: Who needs to sign off on what is permissible language in a podcast, what does and does not need to be bleeped and what kind of warnings need to be given to listeners? The people to consult are: the deputy managing editors (Chuck Holmes & Gerry Holmes) and the standards & practices editor (Mark Memmott).

Our panelists predict what the GOP will try next to bring down Donald Trump.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Now panel, how will the GOP next try to take down the Donald? Adam Burke.

ADAM BURKE: They're going to kidnap him and replace him with an imposter. The plan isn't going to work when the surrogate too closely resembles a human being.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Roxanne Roberts.

ROXANNE ROBERTS: In a genius move, the GOP will nominate a true man of the people, someone born in America, a man beloved by everybody, especially Chris Christie. I speak, of course, of Bruce Springsteen.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Bobcat Goldthwait.

BOBCAT GOLDTHWAIT: They're going to replace his self-tanner with barbecue sauce...

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: ...And wait for him to stand dangerously close to Chris Christie.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

BILL KURTIS: Well, panel, if any of that happens, we're going to ask you about it on WAIT WAIT... DONT TELL ME.

SAGAL: Thank you, Bill Kurtis. Thanks also to Adam Burke, Roxanne Roberts and Bobcat Goldthwait. Thanks to all of you for listening. I appreciate it, glad you did. We'll see you next from New York City.

Most people remember the first time they fall in love. In this excerpt from ""Modern Love: The Podcast,"" the author writes about the actual fall that marked her first love.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Now for a story about falling in love, and not just figuratively. In 2012, Natalie Lindeman went on a first date and she fell a hundred feet down a mountainside into a canyon. Lindeman wrote about her date, that fall and what happened next in an essay for the popular New York Times Sunday column ""Modern Love."" Now, NPR member station WBUR and The New York Times have collaborated to produce ""Modern Love: The Podcast,"" which turns those columns into an experience for the ear.

Here, actor Dakota Fanning reads Natalie Lindeman's essay, ""The Plunge.""

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DAKOTA FANNING: (Reading) Last summer, I fell 100 feet into one of the steepest canyons in the United States. After tumbling 75 feet down the near-vertical canyon side, I dropped another 25 feet in freefall, landing in a dry stream bed between granite boulders.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) I have always loved falling. When I was 3, my favorite game was mantle jumping. My dad would place me on the mantle, steady me and step back. I'd push off and fall for that perfect rush of a second before he caught me, swinging me to the ground. In high school, I found a teenage version of mantle jumping by leaping off high, rocky cliffs with my friends into the ocean below. I loved the way the wind whistled in my ears, making me feel so alive. Yet if I was passionate about adventure, I was cautious about passion. A boyfriend would only slow me down.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) Then near the end of my junior year of high school, a senior named Wilder asked me to prom, and I said yes. Right after I said yes though, my heart started pounding and I raced into an empty classroom to breathe for a minute alone. The smile on my face was so big it hurt. I was determined to keep things casual as we headed out on our first real date.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) To escape the early summer heat, we decided to hike the sage-lined trail to the waterfall in Eaton Canyon. Dozens of hikers were already splashing in the pool when college-age hiker asked if we had heard of the second waterfall only a mile beyond. Although the path was unmarked, we tramped another 20 minutes up the steep incline and found it, beautiful and isolated. It was so easy to be with him. We were coming around a curve in the canyon wall, hurrying to get back while it was still light. Wilder went first, searching for notches and footholds, finally making it around. Then I went, feeling for handholds, my face inches from the rock. I traced to where he had grasped, reaching back with my left foot, searching for the ledge. And suddenly, I wasn't holding onto anything. Sandy grit was skittering down the mountain alongside me. I was falling.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

FANNING: (Reading) I woke up to the sound of helicopter blades. A cable carried me into the air. It struck me; I had just fallen, and now they were taking me up even higher. My dad found me in the too-bright emergency room and tried to hold my hands, but they were a bloody mess like the rest of me. Wilder's in the waiting room, he said. Nurses cut away my clothes with giant scissors and wiped the dirt and blood from my body. I heard scattered phrases - 100 feet, fractured vertebrae, a miracle. Wilder visited as soon as he was allowed. You're off the hook, I said. What do you mean, he asked? I explained in my drugged speech that he didn't have to come to the hospital or hang out with a broken girl all summer. No guilt. I'd call him when I was healed and back to normal. He stayed with me until a nurse kicked him out.

Five days later, I was home. Doctors said I would have to wear a corset-like brace from my hips to my neck for eight to 12 weeks, and then we could talk about recuperation. Sitting up for 20 minutes exhausted me, and I could barely move without wincing in pain.

Wilder kept visiting, and it scared the hell out of me. I fought to look like the girl he had asked to prom. I looked as if I had been mauled by a tiger, but the brace covered most of it. I'd laugh, roll out of bed and walk around as if keeping in constant motion would prove I was strong, independent and unhurt. I figured he'd leave while I slept, but I'd doze off listening to him playing basketball with my little brother and when I'd wake up, he'd be eating dinner with my family.

Sometimes I think my body saved itself that day by learning to surrender, that those years of falling prepared me to relax into the 100-foot plunge. But it was weeks after the fall before I could truly let go. I thought I could use my injuries as an excuse to push Wilder away. I thought I could forget the look on his face as I fell and ignore the terrified feeling of longing in my chest. But I couldn't. Maybe it was the way he said, I'd rather spend my summer with you than any other girl. Maybe it was how being around him made me forget the brace and the wounds, made me feel whole and unbroken. Finally, surrender became not just inevitable but exhilarating. I didn't want to hold onto anything anymore. I wanted to fall, and I already had. And I knew that this time, too, I would be OK.

MARTIN: That was Dakota Fanning reading Natalie Lindeman's essay, ""The Plunge,"" for WBUR and The New York Times's ""Modern Love: The Podcast.""

npr.org,2016-03-09 00:00:00,New Guidelines Help Protect Unborn Babies Of Pregnant Women With Malaria,[],"Studies Reinforce The Urgency Of Treating Pregnant Women With Malaria

i toggle caption Karen Kasmauski/Corbis Karen Kasmauski/Corbis

The world is focused on finding a link between pregnant women infected with the Zika virus and severe birth defects. But two studies and an editorial in this week's New England Journal of Medicine are reminders that malaria, a disease that killed about half a million people in 2015, also has profound consequences for pregnant women and their infants. The new studies provide much-needed guidance on how to prevent and treat malaria during pregnancy.

""Malaria during pregnancy is a major public health concern,"" says Dr. Joel Tarning, Head of Clinical Pharmacology at Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand, and author of the NEJM editorial ""Treatment of Malaria in Pregnancy.""

Recommended treatment for malaria is artemisinin combination therapy, or ACT, a mix of drugs shown to effectively treat the disease. But until now, the treatment has not been tested on women expecting babies.

""Pregnant women are often excluded from clinical trials, which hampers the implementation of these drug treatments,"" says Tarning.

If malaria is left untreated during pregnancy, infected red blood cells gather in the placenta and block the crucial exchange of nutrients from mother to fetus. The result can be miscarriage, stillbirth and low birth weight, says Tarning.

In sub-Saharan Africa, malaria during pregnancy is thought to be responsible for 20 percent of low birth weight babies each year, leading to 100,000 infant deaths, according to a recent NEJM study.

In Africa many people are immune from malaria and show no symptoms when infected, but pregnancy reduces a woman's immunity. Even when an infected woman has no symptoms, the disease can still harm the fetus, again resulting in low birth weight, miscarriage or stillbirth.

Despite a lack of clinical trial evidence on how to safely and effectively prevent and treat malaria during pregnancy, the consequences of no treatment are severe.

""Not treating pregnant women with malaria is not an option, since this is a life-threatening disease,"" says Tarning.

So the current WHO recommendations are that women living in areas where malaria is prevalent sleep under pesticide-treated nets; that women be given two doses of malaria prevention drugs during their pregnancy; and that women with malaria be treated during the second and third trimester.

Those WHO guidelines on treating malaria in pregnant women haven't changed, but now, with good evidence that they are safe and effective, health ministries can be more confident in carrying them out.

""I hope that these studies provide the needed evidence for countries to use ACTs in the treatment of pregnant women with malaria,"" says Tarning.

And they provide support for being treated earlier in pregnancy. Tarning pointed out a new study in The Lancet Infectious Diseases that treatment with ACTs is safe and effective during the first trimester. ""It's time to reconsider first-trimester anti-malarial treatment recommendations,"" he says.

Just as important, he says, the studies show that in countries where many pregnant women are infected with malaria but show no symptoms because of built-up immunity, treatment with ACTs will benefit them and their unborn babies. ""Hopefully, this will start the debate on using ACTs as preventive treatment in this group,"" he says.

Now there is clear guidance on how malaria drugs affect pregnant women. In another study, 3,428 pregnant women with malaria from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Malawi and Zambia were treated with four different anti-malaria drug combinations. Cure rates ranged from 95 percent to 99.2 percent, with few side effects. And the study on preventive treatment in 300 pregnant women with no malaria symptoms found that the drug combination of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, one of the combination drugs, prevented the disease and raised no safety concerns.

These studies on malaria's effect on pregnant women, a group previously not studied adequately in clinical trials, should go a long way in protecting mothers and babies from the harmful consequences of the disease.",[]

I'll Take You There: R&B From NPR Music Loading... I'll Take You There: R&B From NPR Music

""I'll Take You There"" is a 24/7 R&B and soul channel from NPR Music. Curated and hosted by Jason King of the Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music at New York University, the playlist runs the gamut from the genre's origins in the 1940s to today's slow jam stunners. You can follow the program on Twitter at @NPRandB and Jason King's personal Twitter account at @jasonkingsays.

Rhythm and blues is a feeling. Rhythm and blues is about getting up to get down to get on the good foot to get happy and enjoy yourself when the suffering hits, when the blues wants to envelop you like a fog.

In the 1940s, R&B was the marketing term journalist-turned-Atlantic Records-producer Jerry Wexler coined to describe the raucous and jumpy sounds African-Americans were concocting in urban hotspots like New Orleans; it was a newfangled phrase to lift black music from the racist connotation of ""race music."" Rhythm and blues was '40s shouters like Wynonie Harris hollering over tight, post-swing rhythm combos  it was three-dimensional bass lines bouncing around driving beats and spastic saxophones honking like farm pigs.

By the '50s, white folks repackaged the music as rock 'n' roll, but it wasn't long before R&B sprouted new arms, extending itself into the gospelized frenzy of soul, the stairstep harmonies of doo-wop, the cool crossover pop of Motown, the hot circular grooves of funk in the '60s, the boudoir hush of quiet storm and the aspirational sleekness of disco in the '70s. But R&B also left its trace on Jamaican reggae, Nigerian afrobeat, Ghanaian highlife, Chicago and Detroit house, not to mention '80s boogie, synth-funk and hi-NRG, and all those British post-Northern-soul variants. Contrary to popular wisdom, the rise of drum machines and samplers in the '80s and '90s never killed R&B: the music only mutated, reformed, transmogrified and got itself a brand new bag in the form of new jack swing, hip-hop-soul, neo-soul, broken beat and drum 'n' bass. The energy never dies.

At its best, R&B remains a morally and spiritually resonant music about love and intimacy, about carnal pleasure, about unrequited dreams, about girls knocking out boys in outstanding ways.

What links R&B across all that space and time is its emphasis on dance, sex and romance. At its best, R&B remains a morally and spiritually resonant music about love and intimacy, about carnal pleasure, about unrequited dreams, about girls knocking out boys in outstanding ways. It's about being overjoyed and underpaid and living for the weekend and turning your house into a home. It's the music of picket lines and picket signs, of sin and salvation, of hustles, twists and Soul Trains. It's the soundtrack of cities being burned by riots, of communities struggling to be free, of people darker than blue saying it loud and proud to be right on and free. It's the music of corner bars and shabeens and dancehalls and supermarkets and bathhouses and weddings and barbecues and family reunions. It's happy feelings and silent tears, hot grits and raining men, tempestuous telephone calls and profound pillow talk. It's feel-deep music, vibration and frequency meant to resonate in the marrow of your bones and the cells of your blood.

I've curated a 24/7 stream of thousands of songs for NPR that reflect the vast range of what R&B was and what it is and where it's going. You're likely to hear anything from Aretha Franklin to Little Richard to Sylvester to Jodeci to Ruth Brown to IG Culture to Carl Hall to Disclosure to Dinah Washingtonto Roy Ayers to Kelela to The Righteous Brothers to Jorge Ben to Amos Milburn to Jeff Buckley to Louis Jordan. It's all elemental  earth, fire, water and wind music for the body, spirit and mind.",[]

Alex Abramovich was in his 30s when he looked up a guy who had bullied him in grade school. In his new memoir, Abramovich writes about reconnecting with Trevor, now the head of a motorcycle club.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. You've probably had the experience of reconnecting with a childhood friend and being surprised at the direction your friend's life has taken and perhaps discovering that you each have different memories of that childhood friendship. Our guest, writer Alex Abramovich, was in his 30s when he looked up a guy who'd bullied him in grade school, and he found his old tormentor, Trevor, was still using his fists. He headed a motorcycle club in Oakland, called the East Bay Rats, which had a reputation for boozing and brawling. The Rats regularly held neighborhood fistfights at a boxing ring behind their clubhouse, events they promoted with sweatshirts that read, East Bay Fight Night, Support Consensual Bloodshed. Abramovich wrote a magazine piece about the East Bay Rats then moved to Oakland for four years, where he spent so much time with the club that members like to say that he'd embedded with them. His new memoir is about the biker subculture, the struggling city of Oakland and his reflections on the violence in the East Bay Rats' lives and his own. It's called ""Bullies: A Friendship."" He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies.

DAVE DAVIES, BYLINE: Well, Alex Abramovich, welcome to FRESH AIR. Tell us about your memories of Trevor Latham as a child.

ALEX ABRAMOVICH: I remember Trevor as a large, menacing, angry boy, which is funny because when I went back and met him years later and saw photos of him, it turned out that he was a little boy - we were both pretty little kids - and he only had his growth spurt years after I'd initially met him. But I remembered him as just this malevolent force in my life.

DAVIES: When you were how old?

ABRAMOVICH: I would've been 7 years old, and this was in the fourth grade and my dad and I had just moved to a new town. I'd only moved in with my dad the previous year. My mom had died that year so I'd moved in with my father. And then my dad lost his job almost immediately so we moved from Massachusetts in with my grandma in Brooklyn, and then towards the end of that year, we moved to Long Island, which is where I met Trevor. And I was only in that school for two years, but in my memory he loomed as this sort of - the archetypal bully. He was the bully I remembered out of all the bullies I'd known.

DAVIES: So you were classmates. Would he, like, wait for you after school or - what kinds of - if you remember, what kinds of encounters were they?

ABRAMOVICH: Well, our memories are different. My memories diverge from Trevor's. My memory is of Trevor, you know, being the sort of kid that would meet you at the schoolhouse door and threaten to meet you back there at the end of the school day and threaten to beat me up, threaten to kill me. And the way I remember it, he did meet me at the schoolhouse door at the end of the day and he did beat me up, and I remember rolling around on the ground with him tussling, kicking, biting - a lot of fear.

DAVIES: And, if you remember, why was he bullying you? Do you recall having a sense of what motivated him?

ABRAMOVICH: At the time, I had no idea. At the time, I was just this confused, scared kid and here was this force of nature that I suddenly encountered and couldn't quite get around. So I was beyond thinking of motivations at that point. I was just - you know, I was just a mess.

DAVIES: So a lot of time goes by and you reconnect. How did that happen?

ABRAMOVICH: You know how people you met before the Internet existed, you sort of never think to Google them?

DAVIES: Right.

ABRAMOVICH: It was that sort of thing with Trevor. I remembered him and I remembered his name, but I'd never thought to Google him until one day I did. And a very short thing came up on the screen that said, I moved to California, became a bouncer and started a motorcycle club. So I knew at that point that we were - we would meet again. That was too good to pass up.

DAVIES: So you connect and you go out to Oakland. And when you saw him for the first time as an adult, what did he look like?

ABRAMOVICH: He looked like a whale walking upright. He's a massive guy, shaved head, goatee, Roman nose. Just big, big. All of those guys are big, all of the guys in his club. And he was surrounded by the guys in his club the first time I saw him, but even then he stood out. And he looked nothing at all like the boy I'd known, but somehow I knew him immediately. I recognized him, I knew exactly which one he was. And the first time I saw him, he had a - it was in a bar, and he was a bouncer at the bar and he had a guy backed up against the wall and was holding him by the scruff of his shirt so he looked extra menacing.

DAVIES: Did you connect right away? I mean, what - how did he react to your getting in touch?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor's club is the East Bay Rats, that's his motorcycle club, and they have a website - a very bare-bones, old-fashioned website, but Trevor's number is on it. It was a 510 number, and I dialed it, and he was at the bar when I called him. And I said, you don't know me but I used to know you in grade school. We used to know each other in grade school. And, without missing a beat, he said, Alex Abramovich? It was very strange. And we started emailing - texting, but mostly emailing. It was really before texting - late at night, and sort of comparing memories, which turned out to be very different, his and mine. So there was a basis for communication by the time I got out to Oakland, and we got along well. We sat at his bar and - he stopped bouncing - sat down at the bar, and we drank whiskey and then we were drunk. So that's how that first meeting went.

DAVIES: And you hadn't seen each other since the fourth grade, but you clearly remembered him. You'd spoken to your friends about him. So the bullying really left an impression on you. When you reconnected as adults, what was his memory of your relationship as kids?

ABRAMOVICH: Well, I remembered him in part, I think - in retrospect, it seems to me that I remembered him because Trevor Latham is such a strong, good name for a bully. The way he remembered it - it's interesting, in the specific details of what we did - our fights, our memories - pretty much aligned. He remembers fighting, he remembers fighting in the classroom, teachers breaking us up. He remembers us getting sent down to the principal's office. He remembered our fathers having to pick us up at school - much more specific memories than I had, actually. But, weirdly enough, he also remembers that I was bullying him as much as he was bullying me, and, moreover, he remembers that despite that we were good friends at the time. He remembers us playing chess, going to each other's houses. I don't remember any of this. Didn't then, don't now.

DAVIES: And with the light of all of the experience, what's your best guess as to who's right?

ABRAMOVICH: I think in way we're both right. You know, I was an angry, messed-up kid and I'm sure that there were times when I was the aggressor, especially if this was an ongoing, you know, broken relationship between us. But what's also interesting about it is that our - the specific details of our memories line up, but that makes me think that Trevor's a bully, whereas it leads him to think that because we were fighting all the time that meant we must've been friends.

DAVIES: Wow. So he saw - he saw somebody he fought with all the time as a friend.

ABRAMOVICH: Well, not only that, but he grew up to be friends with people he fought with all the time, professionally.

DAVIES: Right, which we're going to get to. But before that, tell me a little about your family and his family when you were kids.

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. Trevor comes from a very, very old family in Long Island, the Lathams, and if you go out to the very northernmost tip of Long Island to Orient, the town called Orient, you'll see the name everywhere on farm stands, hardware stores - it's Latham, Latham, Latham. So his family had been on Long Island forever, and they became very successful. They were lawyers and architects, and there was money. And Trevor's father grew up on an estate on the North Shore in these sort of Gatsby-esque surroundings, but by the time I knew Trevor, the money was sort of gone. His family had split up. His mother and sisters had moved to California so it was just Trevor and Trevor's dad - who was unemployed at the time - sort of stuck in that house.

DAVIES: And do you know what kind of relationship he had with his dad?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor describes his father as being a very angry individual. I think there was a lot of rage. There were holes in the sheetrock where his dad had punched through them. What Trevor told me when I met him was, my father didn't really hit me but the threat was always there, and the threat was more frightening than actually being hit because when anything is possible all the time, sort of all bets are off.

DAVIES: And what was your childhood like with your dad after your mom died?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, my family immigrated to America in 1976 so we didn't really know anyone in the country. And my parents split up about six months after we got here so my mom and I went to live in Pittsburgh and my dad went to live in New York. And he'd visit and I'd see him. We were close, but physically, we were removed by hundreds of miles. And then when my mom got too sick to take care of me, I stayed with a series of family friends. So by the time I went to live with my dad, there'd been a series of sort of dislocations for me, and I think I was already a pretty messed up and somewhat out-of-control kid and a lot for my father to handle. My father - who would've been younger than I am now, I think - all of a sudden is saddled with this damaged, you know, semi-feral child, which was what I was at that time, and I think it was overwhelming for him in some ways. I know I was a lot to handle. And then on top of that, they weren't the best economic times and we had no family in the country, we had no economic safety net. We didn't really know our neighbors so it was very isolating, and all the more isolating because we kept moving. I think by the time I started fourth grade, I had been to eight or nine schools - something like that. So it was hard at home. I think Trevor in some ways had it harder than me, but there were certainly points at which I could relate to his story when I met him.

DAVIES: Well, you go out to Oakland, you connect with Trevor, and he is the head of the East Bay Rats motorcycle club. There are lots of different kinds of motorcycle clubs, you know, some more benign than others. Give us your early impressions of the East Bay Rats.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah, I mean, I think most people picture, you know, ""Sons Of Anarchy,"" let's say, when they picture a motorcycle club, and there's a grain of truth to that depiction, although there's a lot that actual bikers would quibble with. The Rats sort of ride the line between presenting as a criminal organization, but they're not really criminals. They're more - they're miscreants and they're hooligans, but there are no real criminal enterprises. That said, there are a lot of them. There are about 35 at any given time. It's about the size of an Army platoon. They're big. They're not conflict-averse. And they're intimidating, they're in uniform. They're wearing motorcycle leathers, they're wearing armor, they're wearing helmets, they're wearing basically the best gear you could possibly wear in a street fight. And they know what they look like - they're very self-aware - so they're very good at gauging how intimidating they're being or presenting at any given moment.

DAVIES: Describe the clubhouse.

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. The clubhouse is an old barbershop on San Pablo Avenue, which was the oldest street in the East Bay, it used to be the Camino Real. And the clubhouse was - it was always sort of a clubhouse. It was a barbershop. It was an African-American barbershop. So it was always sort of a meeting place. In 2006, the first time I saw it, there was a speak-easy bar next door. That bar, I found out, used to be Huey Newton's speak-easy when he was on that stretch of San Pablo. So it was always this community center, that block, but that said, it had fallen on very tough times indeed. There were a lot of homeless people, there were a lot of recyclers pushing shopping carts, a lot of drugs. There was a lot of violence. So, you know, there'd be bloodstains on the sidewalk and - and the clubhouse itself was about the size of a barbershop with a backyard. And it was a concrete floor, sheetrock walls, boxing equipment wherever you looked. There was a bar that Trevor had installed stripper poles on and women would get up there during parties they threw. And, in the back, there was a barbecue pit and Trevor's old truck, and it was an old Ford Bronco that he'd painted flat black, and a boxing - well, the first time I saw it, there was no boxing ring. There were couches arranged in a square, and that's what served as a boxing ring. Later on, they got an actual boxing ring and put it in back there.

DAVIES: You said that these guys are not conflict averse, which is a nice way of saying they seem to love to mix it up. And there's a section that I'd like you to read here where you're talking about one of the club's members, a guy named John Firpo (ph), and his interaction with a stranger who had said the wrong thing. Do you want to read this for us?

ABRAMOVICH: Sure. (Reading) John Firpo had George Bellows' painting tattooed on his torso. Now I watched him punch the stranger who'd said the wrong thing. A single blow was all that it took to put the man on the concrete. This was a thing the Rats did, for the bored and unstable, for masochists or men who are eager to show off and prove themselves in some dumb way. There was no shame in getting beaten up by one of the Rats. Anyone could walk into the clubhouse, tell one of them off. They'd kick your [expletive] immediately without getting mad or taking things personally.

They were not conflict averse. They wouldn't even gang up on you necessarily. Beat downs were like a community service the Rats provided. The stranger didn't take his personally. He got back on his feet and apologized, told Firpo that his mom had just died, that he'd been messed up, at his wits end and had not meant to say anything all. Now that he had, he was sorry. I'm sorry about your mother, said Firpo as he guided the man out of the clubhouse.

DAVIES: (Laughter) That's a - this is a remarkable scene, and it's almost as if these guys use violence the way others use language, isn't it?

ABRAMOVICH: That's a beautiful way of putting it. Yeah, it's a form of communication and it's also a form of exchanging affections.

DAVIES: Alex Abramovich is our guest. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, our guest is writer Alex Abramovich. His new book, ""Bullies: A Friendship,"" is about a friendship that he renewed with a kid he'd known from his youth who turns out to have founded a motorcycle club in Oakland. Alex Abramovich spent a lot of time there.

Now, the club, as we read your book, seems less about riding bikes than about fighting. And Trevor organized fight nights at which the public would be invited and he would have people in the boxing ring out back. Initially you say it was just a bunch of couches arranged in a square, but eventually there was a boxing ring. Do you want to describe one of these events for us?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, they sound different than they are to attend. They're fun in real life, although they're bloody and violent. And sometimes they were impromptu. Sometimes people - fights would just break out. But sometimes they were very organized and they would have themes. There was, in fact, the Jews versus Gentiles fight night, which would be a two-man versus two-man fight, so a four-man fight. And it would be over bragging rights for who could name the next holiday party. Would it be a Christmas party or would it be a Hanukkah party. And it was billed as the battle of the sects.

DAVIES: The battle of the sects, OK, S-E-C-T, OK.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. So fliers went out all over town. And there was a series of undercards, so a lot of other people fought before the Jews and the Gentiles got into the ring. And oddly enough, I didn't know that there were too many Jewish bikers out there. I'd never really run into them in New York, but there are a couple. In the ring, the violence was very contained. And the further away you went from the ring, the more violent things got. And sort of once you slipped into the shadows, you'd start seeing really nasty things happening. So at the time that the Jews and the Gentiles are fighting in the ring in the back, out front on San Pablo Avenue some recyclers are maybe getting beaten up for instance.

DAVIES: Recyclers - these are, like, guys who pick up cans to get, you know, food for their habits or whatever, right?

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. I mean, there's a recycling center that's a few blocks from the clubhouse. And it's a source of constant tension in the neighborhood because not only are the recyclers with their shopping carts always clogging up San Pablo Avenue, but there are problems having to do with people's houses getting broken into, tools getting stolen, pipes getting stolen. In fact, the East Bay Rats' clubhouse was broken into while I was there and Trevor's plumbing was stolen.

And then there are also issues having to do with public urination, public defecation, prostitution, drug dealing. And remarkably enough, some of the recyclers seem to think that if they'd break their bags full of bottles - they're sold by weight. So they think that if they break their bags full of bottles they'll weigh more because broken glass weighs more than intact bottles. So there's this constant soundtrack of breaking glass.

DAVIES: You describe an incident that you witnessed between some members of the motorcycle club, the East Bay Rats, and a recycler. You want to tell us about that?

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. So the recyclers are kind of a constant presence and when the Rats drink beer, which they do all the time and in fact there's a soda machine that sells dollar beers in the clubhouse, they'll just toss the empties outside and the empties will be gone within 30 seconds or a minute. And that's their form of recycling.

So at the night of one of the fight nights, there was a recycler who kept hovering right around the door. And usually what'll happen at a fight night or an East Bay Rats party is all of the Rats and people belonging to other clubs will ride up to the clubhouse and park their bikes in a neat line down the length of the block. So it makes for quite a visual. And on one night, I saw there was a recycler who kept darting in in between their legs right outside the clubhouse front door to get the cans, basically, to get empty beer cans.

And, you know, there are often people hanging around the Rats who want to impress them, who want to be prospects for the club. And someone like that was around that evening. And he got up at one point, got up off the motorcycle he was sitting on, walked over to the recycler and shoved him hard into the line of bikes. And, you know, I was holding my breath, and for a minute I thought it was going to be OK, but it wasn't OK. Another Rat came up and touching the bike was enough it turned out. Everyone was drunk and a Rat went up and he knocked the man down to the ground. And then a couple of other Rats came out and they knocked the man to the ground. And San Pablo is a wide avenue. It's four lanes with a big median strip. And the man crawled over - the recycler crawled over the median strip and - onto the oncoming traffic lane. And I turned and I saw one of the Rats flip the visor on his helmet down and he was on his motorcycle and he rode it around the median strip. And he rode it up to the recycler who was lying on the ground at this point bleeding. And he rolled his bike back and forth sort of nudging the recycler a few times with the front tire. And then he gunned it and he rode over the recycler's torso, which was very horrible to watch and horrible to think about and horrible also to think that I could've done something to stop it in real time. And I didn't realize that in real time and didn't do anything to stop it, so not a proud moment for me.

DAVIES: And the recycler survived, got up and walked away?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I turned around and I thought I was going to throw up when I saw them ride over the recycler's body. And when I turned back around, the recycler was gone. I was expecting him to be lying on the cement with broken bones, but he had scampered away. The next time I saw Trevor, Trevor said, you'd be surprised. Crack heads are surprisingly resilient, and I said I wish I could've done something to stop it, and Trevor said you could've. All it takes is someone saying stop.

GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Alex Abramovich about his new book, ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll hear more of the interview after a break. And we'll remember The Beatles' record producer George Martin, who died yesterday at age 90. We'll listen back to an interview I recorded with him about helping shape their early sound and about producing ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies recorded with Alex Abramovich about his new memoir, ""Bullies: A Friendship."" It's about reconnecting with a guy who'd bullied him when they were kids. When they reconnected, that guy, Trevor, was the head of a motorcycle club in East Oakland called the East Bay Rats, which was known for their bruising and brawling. The book is in part about that subculture.

DAVIES: What was the East Bay Rats' attitude towards racial diversity? I mean, there's - it's a city with a history of some racial issues certainly.

ABRAMOVICH: Yeah. I didn't know this before I started writing the book, but it turns out that many motorcycle clubs are formed along racial lines. I mean, they form along all sorts of lines. They form along - the police themselves in Oakland have a motorcycle club. In fact, there are two motorcycle clubs associated with the police out there. But well-known national clubs tend to break down along racial lines, and the Rats do not. There are African-American members. There are Jewish members, as I mentioned. There are Mexican-American members. So for the Rats, that's never really been an issue. It's very inclusive in that way. And it's also inclusive sexually I would say. Gays and lesbians are always welcome in the clubhouse. They're welcome in the - at fight nights. It's an interesting question what would happen if an openly gay man were to try to join the Rats. I'm not sure how that would fly. But in terms of people they hang out with, it's absolutely copacetic. So in that sense, the Rats are not - I would say that the Rats are more evolved in certain ways than our present political moment.

DAVIES: And what about their attitude towards women? You know, you hear of motorcycle clubs having women with - wearing things saying that they're the club's property.

ABRAMOVICH: I mean, they're not models of enlightened 21st-century, you know, men. And the gender roles are - tend to be a little old-fashioned maybe by standards employed elsewhere in the Bay Area. There are a couple of young women who hung out with the Rats. Bea (ph) and an Amber (ph) are their names, and they made themselves patches that read East Bay Cats (ph). So they were sort of like the girls auxiliary. But that's not quite the same as saying property of. On the other hand, it's certainly true - and I saw this time and again - that the Rats are both incredibly attractive for and aware of their own attractiveness to certain kinds of women in Oakland. And they take full advantage of that. And the full advantage of that might involve orgies in the back of the bar or the clubhouse. I don't think they really do this anymore. You know, they've aged out of it and they're family men now, but there was a lot of stuff going on in relation to girls.

DAVIES: Were there any stories of rape or sexual abuse of women in the club?

ABRAMOVICH: No. I never heard anything remotely about a rape and I think that I would've. I spent four years with those guys and I spent a lot of that time with people who didn't like those guys, so I would've heard about it. I heard a lot of messed up sexual stories, but nothing that wasn't consensual.

The one thing that happened while I was out there was that at one of the fight nights there was a man that assaulted a young woman. And they were making out and he started choking her and then she was on the ground and then she ran into the clubhouse covered in blood. And she said that this guy had tried to rape her and the Rats came down immediately like avenging angels, and they beat that guy to within an inch of his life. And Trevor said that as I was hitting him I was really sad because I really like this guy but here he was, you know, but then he also felt sad that he didn't break the guy's legs with a shovel.

DAVIES: Because there was a code of some kind.

ABRAMOVICH: The code is - there are rules. They're written down. I wasn't allowed to see them. Prospects aren't even allowed to see them. You're only allowed to see them once you patch in as a member. But I know what some of the rules are, and there are rules governing the treatment of women and the word respect comes up very often. So not only do you not disrespect women when they're around you but you especially respect each other's girlfriends. You have to ask permission before you date someone's ex-girlfriend. As you would imagine, this leads to a certain amount of friction.

DAVIES: You spent some time with the motorcycle club the East Bay Rats when you were writing a magazine article. Then you went back to New York and eventually came back to Oakland with your girlfriend and lived there for quite a while. So you had a lot of experience and spent a lot of time with the guys in the club. What did they think of you?

ABRAMOVICH: They didn't know what to make of me. The first time I met them when I was writing the magazine article, Trevor had told everyone that I was his bully, so they couldn't wait to see the guy who had bullied the president of their motorcycle club. And they were surprised when this, you know, 5-foot-8 guy with glasses stepped out of his rental car.

DAVIES: (Laughter).

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor does not wear glasses and he's well over 6 feet tall. And they did what they would do to anyone that they liked initially - they hazed me. And they put me on a motorcycle on my first full day in Oakland, my first morning in Oakland. And they put me on a motorcycle that I was guaranteed to crash, which I did crash. And I crashed it right away and I crashed it badly. I think they expected a smaller crash, but I crashed it in style. And I broke my hand, but weirdly enough, my hand - I don't know if it was the adrenaline or just the way the nerves are arranged, but for whatever reason my hand didn't hurt until I got back to New York. So instead of going to the hospital, I wrapped it up in boxing tape and I stayed out there for a week, and I kept reporting.

So in a sense we sort of got the hazing out of the way very early and I think that I ended up presenting or appearing as a much braver person than I actually am. If my hand had actually been hurting I would've gone to the hospital. But then the magazine article came out six or seven months later and the Rats liked that very much. They're not criminals, so they don't make any money off the club, so the coin for them is publicity. And they're savvy when it comes to publicity, and this was publicity on a grand national scale, so they liked that a lot.

So the magazine article came out, and it brought them a fair amount of welcome attention, including sexual attention, and they like that. So there was a certain amount of goodwill, I would say, built in by the time I arrived back at the club. But it's a club with, you know, as I said, 35 members and some of them like the cameras and some of them don't like the cameras. And that's a dynamic in and of itself, just having a camera changes what's happening at the clubhouse. So there were Rats that didn't like me at all and probably still don't like me and they pretty much stayed away from me. John Firpo, who we mentioned already, took a very active dislike to me. And John Firpo is a very large and very intimidating, scary dude. And that was unpleasant. John and I got along fine now, but...

DAVIES: Well, I was going to - did you feel afraid ever? I mean, you were there for some long nights with a lot of drinking and I'm sure they got really rowdy. Did you feel afraid?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I didn't feel afraid because I was in - I was working. I was there to take notes. I was drinking sometimes, but I was still working. And there was a sort of circle of safety involved when you were with Trevor. So as long as I stayed within that circle of safety, I felt OK. Now, there were things that happened at the periphery that were not OK and that were scary and frightening and genuinely I would say lightweight dangerous.

DAVIES: Alex Abramovich is our guest. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" We'll continue our conversation in just a moment. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, we're speaking with writer Alex Abramovich. His new book is ""Bullies: A Friendship."" It's about him reconnecting with a kid he'd known from his youth who turns out to have founded a motorcycle club in Oakland. Alex Abramovich spent a lot of time there.

You know, it's interesting. There are places in the book where you have long extended stories quoted verbatim from some of the bikers, particularly Trevor. I assume you carried a tape recorder a lot of the time. And he certainly sounds very well spoken. You do say you wondered at points if he was a sociopath. What made you wonder that?

ABRAMOVICH: Things he did. To give two very brief examples - one was a story that he told me. I picked him up one day. We were going somewhere and he said, you know, it's funny. A crackhead was peeing on my door last night and I opened up the door and there he was. And I took a shovel and, you know, I broke the guy's arm. I could tell I'd broken his arm from the way it was flopping around. But then, you know, I walked inside and I turned on the PlayStation and I was playing ""Star Wars Battlefront"" and I got the highest score I've ever gotten. I thought that was a strange story.

DAVIES: Trevor's life did change over time, right? What's he up to now?

ABRAMOVICH: Trevor's got a very heteronormative life now. I mean, it was pretty heteronormative before, but now it's a pretty just normative let's say. He lives in Emeryville now, which is a small town next to Oakland. He moved out of Oakland because everyone is getting priced out of Oakland these days, or as Trevor put it, Oakland's getting nicer and that's great, but if it gets too much nicer, we'll all have to leave. So he left.

He got a job doing outdoor work with the city of Albany, which is another small town nearby that has really good schools that he can send his kids to. And Trevor has two little boys now. He got married. He stopped being a bouncer. At some point, he bought himself a purple Harley-Davidson. These guys all ride very fast Japanese sports bikes that they customize and turn into Rat bikes - what they call them. But Trevor bought this, you know, giant thing out of ""Purple Rain"" with a CD player, which he's since gotten rid of. Even that was too much for him. But he's got a - Trevor's very wily and he's sort of set himself up with the life that he wants and on the surface at least it looks pretty much like, you know, this American life.

DAVIES: And is there less violence in his life?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, I never saw Trevor - Trevor got into fights while I was there at the bar, but I never saw Trevor inside the ring. I never actually saw him box. He and I sparred together. He taught me how to box, but I never saw him that directly involved in violence. Now he's not a bouncer at the club anymore, so that takes that whole part out of the equation. They still have fight nights, and the club's actually thriving now. It was in a bit of a lull when I was out there.

So on the one hand, he's surrounded by violence, but on the other hand, you know, he's also a father now. And he told me a funny story just this week actually. They were having a fight night and his boy Mason (ph) was there. And Mason's about 2-and-a-half, maybe going on 3 now. And Mason had seen lots of boxing and ultimate fighting on TV and he'd seen people spar at the clubhouse, but he'd never seen an actual fight. And now people are fighting in the boxing ring. And these were people that he knows and loves and cares about and they're hurting each other and they're getting hurt. And Trevor looked down at Mason and he thought, oh, my God, am I one of those parents? What am I exposing my kid to? And before he could do anything, Mesa looked up at his mom and handed her his dinosaurs and ran into the clubhouse. And Trevor - you know, Trevor went after him and he was expecting to find Mason in the corner crying, but instead Trevor said Mason was in there hitting the heavy bag.

DAVIES: Wow (laughter). How well do you feel that you know him? I mean, are you good friends now? Do you feel like you understand him?

ABRAMOVICH: You know, he's my oldest friend, I think. I've known him for 30 - is that right - 35 years now and I'm only 43. And I'm his oldest friend. So in a sense there's a very deep connection and whenever we don't see each other for a while, we pick up the thread very quickly. As far as understanding him, I think my understanding of him is contained in that I can sort of walk around him and describe him. And I think I did a pretty good job of it in the book of describing how he comes across, how his very, very unusual mind works. But in terms of really, really going in there and untangling the motivations, yeah, you know, the short answer is I do think I get it and I think I described it. He functions under tremendous internal pressures and he has absorbed a great deal of poison and he's gotten better and better at with every passing year at lancing that poison and finding productive ways to - or at least non-self-destructive ways to let seep back out into the world.

DAVIES: Well, Alex Abramovich, thanks so much for speaking with us.

ABRAMOVICH: Thanks so much, Dave. It was a pleasure.

GROSS: Alex Abramovich is the author of the new memoir ""Bullies: A Friendship."" He spoke with FRESH AIR contributor Dave Davies, who is also WHYY's senior reporter.

i toggle caption Lydia Thompson/NPR Lydia Thompson/NPR

Bernie Sanders was the story of Tuesday night as he beat Hillary Clinton in Michigan's Democratic presidential primary. It wasn't a walloping  he won by less than 2 points  but still a big coup considering Clinton led in most polls by double digits before the race.

Michigan is Sanders' ninth state win, though Clinton still leads in delegates overall.

That means Sanders is only partway up a steep hill to the nomination.

""I am used to climbing steep hills,"" Sanders told NPR's Ari Shapiro, host of All Things Considered, noting that when he began his campaign he was unknown to most Americans. ""Stay tuned. I think we are going to go further and we have a good chance to pull off the biggest political upset in the modern history of America. We can win this thing.""

As far as the delegate count so far goes, he admits, ""We have not done well in the deep South,"" but adds that ""it's not surprising. The South is a pretty conservative area, I'm not a conservative.""

But he points out the wins he has had in New England, the Midwest and West. Given those, he said, he thinks he has a ""pretty good chance"" to win in New York and an ""excellent chance"" in California, Oregon, Hawaii and smaller states like Montana and Idaho.

However, an NPR analysis found that even if on Tuesday, Sanders wins 55 percent of the delegates in Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, but Clinton wins 60 percent in North Carolina, Sanders would slip further behind, needing 54 percent of all remaining delegates.

After next week, even if Sanders wins four large, non-Southern contests (Wisconsin, Oregon, Washington and California) with 60 percent, he would still need to pick up 51 percent of the delegates from all remaining contests to win a majority of pledged delegates.

And there's another challenge ahead of him. He won Michigan largely thanks to white voters, but has struggled to appeal to African-Americans. He won a larger share of black votes in Michigan than he had been winning, but still not a majority  just around 30 percent.

The real hurdle, he says, is getting his message out to black voters  in a way that Hillary Clinton hasn't already.

""I don't think it's a question of us winning over black voters, I think it is a question of Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton having very strong support in the African-American community,"" he said. ""I congratulate them.""

Sanders also responded to his comment in the last debate that drew ire from some black leaders (""When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto""), emphasizing his track record on poverty.

""There's no candidate who has talked more about poverty in this country than I have. White poverty, black poverty and Latino poverty,"" he said. ""Now it would be nice if every once in a while the media paid attention to those issues, which we don't.""",[]

(Note on Aug. 19, 2015: This guidance has been mostly superseded. Go here to see our new guidance.)

Five months after we issued guidance on how to refer to the group known as the Islamic State, is it time to do away with the rule that listeners and readers be reminded that it is self-declared, self-proclaimed, self-styled or known as?

The consensus from the foreign desk editors is that it is not time to do that.

The reasoning remains the same:

 The words help distinguish the Islamic State from nations, such as the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.

 Not adding the words implies that the organization is a state, when in fact it is not an independent government ... within defined borders. Those are key parts of the words definition.

There is one tweak to the guidance. So-called is not one of the phrases we should rely on. It doesnt convey as much information as self-declared or self-proclaimed, which make clear to listeners and readers where the name came from.

Related note: ISIS remains our style on second reference. If someone we speak with uses ISIL or Daesh, we can again remind the audience that the group is also known by those names. Also, if a show has already introduced the Islamic State in one segment, theres probably no need to go through the self-proclaimed/self-declared/etc. steps again in a subsequent segment.

npr.org,,Please Read The CJR Report About Rolling Stone,[],"Please Read The CJR Report About Rolling Stone

The particulars of Rolling Stones failure make clear the need for a revitalized consensus in newsrooms old and new about what best journalistic practices entail, at an operating-manual-level of detail.

That line from the Columbia Journalism Reviews dissection of Rolling Stones infamous investigation of an alleged gang rape underscores why the CJR report is highly recommended reading. It reminds us that the basics matter  a lot.

CJR concludes that better and clearer policies about reporting practices, pseudonyms and attribution might well have prevented the magazines errors. ... Stronger policy and clearer staff understanding in at least three areas might have changed the final outcome. From the report:

 Pseudonyms. [Editors] said using pseudonyms at Rolling Stone is a case by case issue that requires no special convening or review. Pseudonyms are inherently undesirable in journalism. They introduce fiction and ask readers to trust that this is the only instance in which a publication is inventing details at its discretion. Their use in this case was a crutch  it allowed the magazine to evade coming to terms with reporting gaps. Rolling Stone should consider banning them. If its editors believe pseudonyms are an indispensable tool for its forms of narrative writing, the magazine should consider using them much more rarely and only after robust discussion about alternatives, with dissent encouraged.  Checking Derogatory Information. [The reporter and her editor] made the fateful agreement not to check [a key part of the accuser's story that put three people in an unfavorable light] with the three friends. If the fact-checking department had understood that such a practice was unacceptable, the outcome would almost certainly have changed.  Confronting Subjects With Details. When [the reporter] sought comment, she missed the opportunity to hear challenging, detailed rebuttals from [the fraternity] before publication. The fact-checker relied only on [the reporter's] communications with the fraternity and did not independently confirm with Phi Kappa Psi the account Rolling Stone intended to publish. ... If both the reporter and checker had understood that by policy they should routinely share specific, derogatory details with the subjects of their reporting, Rolling Stone might have veered in a different direction.

Our Ethics Handbook deals with those points. Here is where NPR stands:

 Dont Create Pseudonyms For Sources Whose Names We Withhold. When we decide to withhold a sources name from a story, we dont invent a pseudonym for that source. Again, our job is to present factual  not fabricated  information. Instead, we use pronouns and descriptions to make clear who is speaking or whom were referring to. (Or we may refer to him or her without using a last name, if the source is comfortable with that degree of anonymity, and the situation meets our standards for granting anonymity. ... )  No Attacks. In our coverage, anonymous or unnamed sources generally cannot make pejorative comments about the character, reputation, or personal qualities of another individual, or derogatory statements about an institution. ... [Exceptions are made only after] careful deliberation with senior news managers.  Give Sources Time To Respond. If our audience wonders what someone we report about had to say in his or her defense, and we havent provided that information or explained our efforts to get it, we have failed.  Give Subjects Enough Information To Be Able To Respond Effectively. In 2005, NPR aired a story about the new editor of the Paris Review. Former staffers of the magazine  some of whom had been let go  were heard saying that the new leader was betraying the vision of the Reviews founder, George Plimpton. What was the editors response to that charge? He didnt get the chance to say. Our interview with him was done before the critics were contacted, and the editor wasnt contacted again. NPR subsequently apologized on the air for not giving the editor the chance to answer his critics. As Bill Marimow, then-NPR vice president for news, said: If the subject of the story doesnt know what youre going to report, how can we be fair to them? 

CJRs analysis makes clear that several people are to blame for Rolling Stones failures, starting with the reporter and extending to her editors. So heres another reminder from our handbook:

Edit Like A Prosecutor. Great journalism comes in part from the collaborative efforts of reporters, editors and producers, who all play a key role in ensuring accuracy. We believe in teamwork. But good editors are also good prosecutors. They test, probe and challenge reporters, always with the goal of making NPRs stories as good (and therefore as accurate) as possible.

Attempting to escape Lady Schrapnell's demands and find some bedrest, Ned absconds to 1880s Oxford  where his arrival triggers a sequence of events as hilarious as they are inventive. This beautiful comedy of manners includes a charming homage to Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat, as Ned bumbles his way through boating, dogs, romance, eccentric Oxford dons and dreadful contemporary taste in a desperate search for the fantastical bishop's bird stump.

Sheryl Sandberg. Hillary Clinton. Malala Yousafzai. Oprah. Even Taylor Swift.

These names pop up when you Google ""women changing the world."" Depending on your politics and point of view, you may agree that these influencers have broken stereotypes, raised global awareness for critical issues like energy and education, and/or served as role models for girls.

What about Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy? Etheldreda Nakimuli-Mpungu? Kiran Gandhi? Have you heard of them?

Probably not.

But they deserve a Google shout-out too. They're some of the unsung women making strides in the developing world. In honor of International Women's Day and Women's History Month, here's a collection of some amazing global women that NPR has profiled in just the past few months. Maybe in a few years they'll top Google's lists of women changing the world in ways large and small.

Rosa Coj Bocel, student

Bocel, 27, is the star of a short documentary about her life in rural Guatemala, Rosa  These Storms. The indigenous Mayan woman grew up in poverty, was pulled out of school early, then became pregnant. Her daughter died at the age of 2 from hydrocephalus, a condition marked by a buildup of fluid in the brain. Despite these hardships, Bocel persevered. A few years ago, she graduated from high school and is now studying to be a registered nurse. Her dream is to open a pharmacy in her village.

Dr. Odontuya Davaasuren, doctor and professor

Davaasuren, a family doctor and professor at the Mongolian National University of Medical Sciences in Ulaanbaatar, has one goal: to improve the way people die. Called ""the mother of palliative care"" in her country, she's helped raise more awareness and funding for end-of-life care. Now poor families taking care of a terminally ill person can get about 36,000 tugrik [$18] each month from the government until the patient dies. ""It's very small but still supportive,"" says Davaasuren.

Kiran Gandhi, period activist

Gandhi, 26, a Los Angeles-based musician and feminist, ran the London Marathon while on her period without using any hygiene products. She wanted to let her blood flow freely to encourage women not to feel embarrassed about their periods, and raise awareness for girls and women around the world who do not have access to feminine care products.

Stephanie Linus, filmmaker

Linus, 33, a Nigerian filmmaker and actor, created a Nollywood movie called Dry about obstetric fistula  a hole between the vagina and bladder (or rectum in some cases) that can result from prolonged obstructed labor in childbirth, leaving a woman unable to control her bodily waste. Some 2 million women are affected worldwide. Surgery can help but is not always an option, since many of the women affected are poor. She hopes her film educates the world about the problem, and she's raising money for the Extended Hands Foundation, which she set up to support surgical help.

Dr. Etheldreda Nakimuli-Mpungu, scientist

Mpungu, 41, is a Ugandan doctor and researcher who is a pioneer in treating symptoms of depression in people with HIV. The medical community in sub-Saharan Africa believed these individuals were ""beyond help,"" she says. She's developed therapeutic programs that have been welcomed by the patients: ""We were surprised because we had thought maybe people wouldn't want to come ... due to stigma, but they actually wanted something like this  so badly.""

Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, documentary filmmaker

Chinoy won the Oscar for best documentary, short subject, for A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness, which tells the story of honor killings in her home country of Pakistan from a rare point of view: the survivor's. Saba, an 18-year-old girl, was shot and thrown in a river by her own family for secretly eloping. But she lived to tell the tale. After the Pakistani prime minister watched the film, he pledged to change the laws to protect girls from honor killing.

Garmai Sumo, nurse, Ebola body collector

Sumo, 29, a nurse in Liberia, is the star of the Oscar-nominated short documentary Body Team 12. Amid the chaos of Ebola, Sumo was a voice of hope and faith. Today she works with children orphaned by the deadly virus.

Jugbeh Tarpleh Kekula, nurse

Kekula is a registered nurse who works nights in the emergency room at the Liberia Government Hospital in Buchanan, the third-largest city in the country. She also educates people about family planning through Planned Parenthood of Liberia. In December 2015, she won a contest called ""Integrity Idol"" for being an ""honest government official."" As she puts it: ""I do not hide my feelings. I'm someone who is bold; I am to the point. If even the oldest person does wrong to me, I will go and [say], 'What you did to me, I don't like it.' I believe in truthfulness; I believe in fairness. I hate lies. You know, stick to your words.""

npr.org,2014-07-03 00:00:00,Motorcycles As Literary Metaphor,['Matthew B'],"Vroom, Vroom, Hmmmm: Motorcycles As Literary Metaphor

i toggle caption Solvejg Wastvedt Solvejg Wastvedt

Motorcycles provide an open road for literature  literally and figuratively. They're sometimes the dramatic device writers use to talk about many things: adventure, rebellion, even inner peace. But motorcycles aren't just a metaphor at Bartel's Harley-Davidson shop in Marina Del Rey, Calif. They're loud and shiny and very real.

More on the Book Your Trip series For more great cycling tales, check out NPR's Book Your Trip series. We've got recommendations for literary travel by train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time machine and even giant peach.

This is where we find Jeff Bragg, who claims he has been riding since he was 3. He reads an excerpt from Hunter S. Thompson's book Hell's Angels: ""Tense for the action, long hair in the wind, beards and bandanas flapping, earrings, armpits, chains, whips, swastikas and stripped-down Harleys flashing chrome as traffic on 101 moves over, nervous, to let the formation pass like a burst of dirty thunder.""

In literature, motorcycles  and the people who ride them  often represent an outlaw spirit, danger and sex. For motorcyclist Allie MacKenzie, that's a no-brainer. ""Who in their right mind can pass up a bad boy on a bike?"" MacKenzie rides a Harley Sportster Forty-Eight. At Bartel's, she picks a passage from the book Motorcycle Man by Kristen Ashley: ""I was panting, and he was cursing. It was the most wonderful thing that had ever happened to me. If he would have asked me to, I would have jumped on the back of his bike and ridden to the ends of the Earth with him.""

On the opposite end of the motorcycle fascination spectrum sits Matthew B. Crawford. By his own description, he's in the ""knowledge industry."" He has a Ph.D. and has worked at think tanks. He also owns his own motorcycle repair shop in Richmond, Va., and he's the author of Shop Class as Soulcraft  a manifesto for the importance of working with one's own hands. Fixing, restoring and riding motorcycles, he says, is very different from writing about them.

Writing ... is like pulling teeth ... it's rare where you hit that state of flow where things are just clicking  which is kind of the routine experience on a bike.

""Writing-with-a-T is like pulling teeth,"" he says, enunciating the ""t"" sound. ""There are moments of pleasure when you feel like you've really nailed it. But it's this activity where I have to force myself to sit and go over something over and over again to try to get it right, and it's rare where you hit that state of flow where things are just clicking  which is kind of the routine experience on a bike, especially when there's like heavy traffic that's moving fast and there's all these obstacles. All of your senses are just keyed in and kind of hyper alert, so it's a very heightened state of consciousness.""

That state is what Rachel Kushner captures in her novel The Flamethrowers: ""I was going one hundred miles an hour now, trying to steer properly from my hunched position as insects ticked and thumped and splatted against the windscreen. It was suicide to let the mind drift,"" she reads.

Kushner's protagonist, Reno, races through the desert trying to break a land-speed record. ""She's in the moment, very present to it, because she doesn't want to crash,"" says Kushner. ""I wrote it based on, to some degree, my own experience. I know what it's like to go very fast on motorcycles. Those moments, they stay with you.""

In literature, motorcycle trips are sometimes an escape, a way to chase away a bad marriage, a midlife crisis. A more profoundly political coming-of-age ride took place in 1952, when a 23-year-old, pre-revolutionary Che Guevara set off from Buenos Aires with a friend on the back of a Norton 500 to explore South America. Guevara's book The Motorcycle Diaries was published in 1993, years after his death, and was later turned into a movie.

""These two young men with a shared love of adventure, of women, of speed, and this bike, and this shared political yearning,"" says journalist Jon Lee Anderson, author of Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life. Anderson says the seven- or eight-month motorcycle trip was really a coming of age for medical student Guevara and his friend.

""The idea [was] that they needed to see something of their continent beyond the rather privileged confines of their Argentina, their white Argentina,"" says Anderson. ""They took off on this bike and traveled through the indigenous and mestizo back roads and backwoods of their continent. It was an extraordinary experience for young Guevara. It really was a determinant in his life, deciding what he would become.""



The Norton broke down, as motorcycles will  but even that experience can take you someplace, a phenomenon Robert Pirsig examines in his now classic 1974 book Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.

""When you get stuck on fixing motorcycles, that's not a bad moment. That's actually a pretty good moment,"" he told NPR in 1974. ""The times I've been stuck, I've been able to catch myself at being stuck and, instead of getting mad, just gone off and had a cup of coffee. And I notice whenever I'm stuck like that, that if I look at the clouds, the clouds are much more beautiful. I find at the very moment of stuckness, if you just stop and look around you, you find the world is very real.""

Back at Bartel's, biker Ron Hamberg reads from Zen, a moment in which Pirsig contrasts riding a motorcycle with the more passive act of driving in a car. In a car, Pirsig writes, ""you're a passive observer and it is all moving by you boringly in a frame. On a cycle, the frame is gone. You're completely in contact with it all. You're in the scene, not just watching it anymore. And the sense of presence is overwhelming.""

Hamberg  covered with tattoos  rides a Harley. He says he has read books by Charles Dickens, Mark Twain and Mahatma Gandhi. But as for books about motorcycles, he growls, ""I just ride 'em. I don't read about 'em.""",[]

Our panelists answer questions about the week's news....Half Off.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

We want to remind everyone they can join us most weeks right here at the Chase Bank Auditorium in downtown Chicago, Ill. For tickets and more information, go over to wbez.org or you can find a link at our website, waitwait.npr.org. Right now panel, it is time for you to answer some questions about this week's news. Adam, for years, scientists have been looking for the female Viagra. Well, a little while ago, something purporting to be the female Viagra was put on the market. And after studying its benefits, we now know it provides its users on average how many, quote, ""satisfying sexual encounters"" per month?

(LAUGHTER)

BOBCAT GOLDTHWAIT: Oh, I know this one.

ADAM BURKE: Here's my question...

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: Two questions - does it require someone else to be there, and how big is this pill?

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: It's a valid point.

SAGAL: Perhaps...

GOLDTHWAIT: Does this pill cuddle?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So as you know, Viagra, invented some years ago, has been a huge best-seller because it gets men, as you know, ready, willing and able.

BURKE: As I know - thanks. Thanks, Pete.

SAGAL: You're welcome. And according to careful studies of nearly 6,000 women who use this regularly, the effect of this pill was to arrange or create for them how many satisfying sexual experiences per month?

BURKE: Oh, like a frightening amount. Like...

SAGAL: Take a guess.

BURKE: Like debilitating.

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: Let's say - I have no idea - 15.

SAGAL: Lower.

BURKE: Is that...

SAGAL: Fewer, fewer, I should say.

BURKE: Yeah. I don't know, six?

SAGAL: Fewer.

BURKE: Really?

SAGAL: Yes.

BURKE: So, like, one?

SAGAL: Fewer.

BURKE: What?

GOLDTHWAIT: Zero.

ROXANNE ROBERTS: That's what I was going to - yeah.

BURKE: Wait, what is half of a satisfying sexual experience?

SAGAL: That's exactly right.

BURKE: Wow.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: One half of one satisfying sexual experience.

BURKE: Wait, yeah, one half of a satisfying sexual experience - that just describes most heterosexual couples.

SAGAL: Exactly.

GOLDTHWAIT: Yeah or when her husband comes home.

SAGAL: Yeah, pretty much. One half of one per month, every month. It's like a sex timeshare.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: You have to get a roll in the hay, but first you have to sit through a 45-minute presentation.

npr.org,2014-07-19 00:00:00,The Lure Of Literary Time Travel,['Connie Willis'],"Watch Out For That Butterfly: The Lure Of Literary Time Travel

i toggle caption The Kobal Collection The Kobal Collection

Where would you go, if you had a time machine? Ancient Egypt? Tang Dynasty China? The Globe Theater, in 1599? Or maybe to the 25th century, because who knows, Buck Rogers might actually be there.

Sadly, no one's likely to invent a working time machine any time soon. But that hasn't stopped the legions of writers who've been exploring time travel ever since H. G. Wells described his first Morlock. Slips and drops and nets and projections and paradoxes  writers have thought up a hundred ways to travel backwards and forwards in time. And that's one of the great things about literary time travel: the way every writer seems to invent the mechanism all over again, every time they put pen to paper.

You can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

""We can actually do whatever we want,"" says science fiction author Connie Willis. She's won all kinds of awards for her tales of time-traveling historians  like Doomsday Book and To Say Nothing of the Dog. Willis says the best thing about time travel is no one's invented it yet  so it can be whatever you want.



""You know, you can change history or not change history, you can go as an observer, you can go where you actually become part of the past and help fulfill history, it's pretty limitless.""

Well, within reason  don't go stepping on any ancient butterflies, or accidentally shooting your own grandfather. You don't want to cause a paradox. ""The trickiest part of writing time travel is the paradoxes,"" Willis says, ""because the truth is, you know, we can't go back in time, one of the reasons is, just by being there we would change things, you know, so that's what you spend most of your time doing!""

Avoiding paradoxes is especially tricky for Willis, who's generally keeping track of multiple characters jumping around to different points in time. ""And I have to remember, that happened earlier, but later, and hasn't happened yet  and I usually end up writing angry notes to myself at the head of every page: she still thinks he's a murderer!""

Unlike Willis's historians, I can't go back in time  but I can do the next best thing, which is to visit Readercon, a speculative fiction convention that happens every year in Boston. If anyone knows about time travel literature, it's these folks. In fact, this year they held an entire panel devoted to time travel. Panel moderator  and occasional NPR contributor  K. Tempest Bradford is working on a time travel novel herself, ""basically doing Shakespeare's Twelfth Night with time travel instead of shipwrecks,"" she says.

Part of the appeal of time travel, Bradford adds, is the lure of experiencing other times and places. But it's also a chance for a cosmic do-over. ""I know that if I were to travel back in time, I might warn some people that they shouldn't do this or that thing, or they should maybe be careful who they trade blankets with.""

Writer, bookseller and Readercon attendee Leah Bobet says the past is fascinating because it's the one place we can't go, ""and there are so many ways time travel stories both question and reinforce the past-is-past paradigm. And so it's grappling with regret, it's learning to emotionally deal with the consequences of the one thing we can't really undo.""

It tends to be the past that people talk about, when they talk about time travel. ""And that's interesting,"" says Bobet, ""because the future is always coming. The future's coming whether you like it or not, second by second by second  the past is never coming again.""

Unless, of course, you have a time machine  and that brings us to the quintessential time traveler's dilemma: Assuming you could get to Berlin in 1937, should you kill Hitler? ""Oh yeah,"" says Connie Willis. ""That's the dilemma of time travel, is that no event is unconnected to every other event. And so you could bring about something much worse. Except that Hitler was so bad and so unique, I have a tendency to think that given the chance, yeah. You betcha.""

Personally, I might go back to Sarajevo in 1914 and slip Gavrilo Princip a knockout drop instead. If I had a time machine.",[]

SAGAL: Canadians can no longer apply to be contestants on ""Jeopardy."" ""Jeopardy"" says - it's a little unclear. They say it's because of Canada's new privacy laws on electronic communication. The Canadian government no longer allows ""Jeopardy"" to communicate with Canadian people the way that they want to, so no more Canadians.

The Labs' engineering group is recognized internationally as a radio technology authority. In 2003 the team developed digital multicasting for HD Radio, the replacement technology for analog radio, and they conducted research and tests that led to improvements in the performance of HD technology.

Multicasting makes it possible for all radio stations  commercial and non-commercial  to offer multiple streams of programming on one channel, free to the public. More Labs-initiated innovations in digital radio are underway, including development of accessible media services for those with hearing and vision impairments.

Satellite and International Radio

Beyond the radio station network, and web and mobile services and applications, NPR programs a channel on Sirius XM Satellite Radio and one web-based stream. NPR also produces multiple international services heard in more than 150 countries, provides programming for Armed Services Radio and operates a radio station in Berlin.

A Brief History Of NPR And Public Radio

1920s-'40s

Our roots go back to the earliest days of American broadcasting. In the 1920s, many of the country's first radio stations grew up at colleges and universities who wanted to experiment with this new medium to educate and entertain the public. In the late 1940s, the Federal Communications Commission allotted the lower end of the new FM band exclusively to noncommercial, educational stations, setting the stage for a major station expansion. This is where most public stations are still found today.

1950s-'60s

As commercial radio began its first decline with the advent of TV, public radio grew, along with public TV. The big breakthrough came in 1967, when President Lyndon Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act. This new law led to the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which Congress called upon to encourage ""the growth and development of non-commercial radio"" and to develop ""programming that will be responsive to the interests of the people.""

CPB introduced technical and professional standards to improve what were then mainly small stations. Soon, CPB and individual stations saw the need for a national radio service to bring Johnson's vision to life.

1970s

NPR was incorporated on Feb. 26, 1970, by 90 forward-thinking charter stations to provide national news programming. In April 1971, NPR hit the air with live coverage of the Senate hearings on the war in Vietnam. Just a month later, NPR debuted its first weekday newsmagazine, All Things Considered. In 1977, NPR assumed a new responsibility  to represent the interests of NPR member stations (who had grown from 90 to 190)  before Congress, the FCC and others. NPR's morning newsmagazine, Morning Edition, launched in 1979, signaling that the network was becoming an all-day news service.

1980s

This was a decade of transformational and tumultuous change. NPR launched the first ever nationwide, satellite-delivered radio distribution network to serve a growing network of about 250 stations, ushering in a decade that saw an explosion in new national programs for public radio. In 1983, NPR suffered a severe financial crisis; it emerged with stronger governance and management, and an improved business model that ultimately propelled growth for both NPR and stations.

1990s

A growing interest in news  local, national and international, led to expanded distribution of NPR programming and growth in audience. The Gulf War inspired the 1991 launch of NPR's first talk program, Talk of the Nation, and ultimately, the emergence of the public radio news-talk format. NPR launched NPR Worldwide in 1993, providing programming beyond the boundaries of the U.S., and throughout the decade NPR stations expanded their services  acquiring additional stations and growing their own programming and operations. The effort in 1994 to eliminate federal funding for public broadcasting led to an unprecedented burst in contributions from listeners, and a groundswell of non-partisan political support from the public. Federal support for public broadcasting was maintained.

2000s

Sept. 11, 2001, was a turning point for NPR, a catalyst to shift our orientation even more fully to high-quality, contextual, timely news  both domestic and foreign. Over the past few years, NPR has extended its focus to build an equally compelling service on NPR.org, as well as mobile sites and apps. These digital platforms offer more ways to listen, learn and experience NPR and its member stations, and new people are discovering the network every day.

Today NPR is experiencing another era of innovation, not unlike the earliest days of radio  though much faster, and more chaotic and dynamic. The network's radio service offers a strong foundation, as NPR and its stations are actively embracing the power and potential of digital media to serve our mission.",[]

It's also a deeply cinematic story  in fact, it's currently in development as a miniseries at AMC. And even in its darkest moments, it's a compelling read: The Sparrow follows the crew of a near-future first-contact expedition to an alien planet, alongside the testimony of Jesuit priest Emilio Sandoz, who is recovering from his part in the ordeal. This isn't just a story about the rigors of space travel and the difficulties of establishing communication after contact. It also explores the way travel forces us to acknowledge what we've left at home, how travel can be an act of faith (regardless of religion), and the ways in which journeys demand internal audits to determine how we've changed in the crossing. (And if you can't get enough of Sandoz, you can follow him in The Sparrow's sequel, Children of God.)

There have been a couple times in recent weeks when people weve interviewed asked that we remove their names from the stories we posted on the Web. We have issued guidance on this topic several times before. Reminders seem to be in order about how to avoid getting into such situations and how to handle them if they arise.

Click on these headlines to see our guidance:

 This Story About You Is Going To Be On The Web Forever And You May Come To Regret That

 Reminder: Whether To Go With First-Name-Only Needs To Be Discussed And Explained

 How To Explain Why We Wont Take Down A Story

 When Were Asked To Remove A Photo, Heres What We Do

Here are some important points from those notes:

 Were not saying that Sen. Doe or Mayor Smith or CEO Jones need to be reminded that what they say to us is on the record and will be available to anyone with a Web connection. They should know what theyre doing.

 The notes dont cover reporting done in war zones or situations when stopping to have a long conversation about the long tail of the Web isnt safe or practical.

 But the guidance does cover other situations involving people who are vulnerable. Those include survivors of sexual assault, people with serious medical conditions and those whose lives may be put in danger if they are fully identified. As the handbook says, we minimize undue harm and take special care with those who are vulnerable or suffering.

We do not preview our stories for those we interview. But it is essential that vulnerable individuals understand in general how we will be using the information we get from them, how we will identify them and whether any images of them will be published (remember: visuals are important parts of our journalism and we treat them that way). There may be times when people say we can use their full names and photos and we are not comfortable doing so.

It must be made clear to such individuals that our stories do not only air on the radio  they live on various digital forms and will be searchable on the Web.

How such individuals names, biographical details and images will be handled must be discussed with a senior editor well before anything is aired or published. That means a supervising senior editor, a deputy managing editor or the standards & practices editor. In reality, theyll all probably be involved.

One other reminder (because were asked about it at least once a week):

When we decide to withhold a sources name from a story, we dont invent a pseudonym for that source.

i toggle caption Kevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty Images Kevin Mazur/WireImage/Getty Images

At pretty much any Lady Gaga performance, you can count on spectacle: whirling lights, elaborate sets and many, many costume changes. When she took the stage at the Grammy Awards this year, things were no different  except that she was deploying her famous pipes in the service of another artist's music. As she pinballed through David Bowie's catalog in a career-spanning tribute to the late icon, it was a reminder that the 29-year-old Gaga is as much a chameleonic overachiever as her hero. After six Grammys of her own, a Golden Globe for her role on American Horror Story: Hotel, duets with Tony Bennett, a Super Bowl national anthem and one very famous meat dress, there appears to be little that the woman born Stefani Germanotta cannot do.

And yet, she recently surprised herself. Alongside veteran hitmaker Diane Warren, Gaga co-wrote the song ""Til It Happens to You"" for the 2015 film The Hunting Ground, a documentary about rape on college campuses. The track is up for an Oscar, but the bigger breakthrough is a personal one. Like Warren, Gaga is a survivor of sexual assault, and says the decision to work on the song didn't come easily  but that once it was out there, stories from other survivors came flooding in, some prefaced with the admission that they'd never felt comfortable sharing their experiences until now.

Lady Gaga joined NPR's Michel Martin from New York to talk about songwriting that hits close to home, how artists and fans benefit from mutual support, and what David Bowie meant to her as a teenager gazing on the cover of Aladdin Sane for the first time. Hear the radio version at the audio link, and read more of their conversation below.

Michel Martin: I want to start off by talking about ""Til It Happens to You,"" which is nominated for an Oscar. I know it's not easy to talk about, but may I ask how you came to be involved in this project?

Lady Gaga: ""Til It Happens to You"" is something that has come out of a group of women coming together, who decided that they wanted to make a change. And that's me and Diane Warren and Bonnie [Greenberg], who was the music supervisor. When we first started talking, I was really not sure what to do. I have a very uncomfortable relationship with this topic because it's so personal to me, and I didn't know if I was ready to be a part of it. And as soon as I met Diane and she started to talk to me about what she wanted to do, I knew that I had to be brave, and I had to help tell this story to the world.

So, Diane and I met in New York City. She played me this song idea that she had started, and I immediately started crying. I was really unsure, even in that moment, if I was going to be able to do it. And she said, ""Well, I want you to make it your own. I want it to be something that you feel connected to."" And we started to change the song together  make it something that reflected both of our experiences with sexual assault. I guess it's a long story, but what I'm trying to say is that it's a quite complicated one. And it starts with me, when I was a young girl: I had this traumatic experience, and it's sort of coming full circle now, and really ending in a way for me, as I'm healing from it in writing this song with Diane.

Have other artists come to you since you recorded this song to talk about this issue? It just seems as though a number of people in your industry have had similar experiences and didn't talk about it for years, or ever.

Yeah, there are. I wouldn't reveal names of anyone that came to me personally to express that they had been through something similar. But there's a lot of people, men and women all over the world, who have experienced sexual assault not only on campuses and not only in the music industry, but within their own families and within their own relationships. It has been kind of overwhelming for both Diane and I, the amount of letters and people on the street that stop us to talk about this song and to tell us how much it means to them. I've had reporters tell me about their experiences with sexual assault in interviews, and they've told me, ""I've never ever told anyone that but you."" You know, that's a powerful thing to witness.

As an artist, and also through your foundation, you've worked on some really raw and emotionally complex issues. Given that you have a voice you can use to elevate a topic, how do you decide what you want to talk about?

Well, I always have been an activist for things that were just authentically a part of my life, that I felt connected to. In terms of my involvement in ""don't ask, don't tell"" and marriage equality and anti-bullying and social emotional learning in schools  these are all things that arise out of my relationship with the world and with my fans. I listen to them, I meet with them, they write me letters; I'm in tune with what people want to change in the world, and I want to be a part of moving that forward. I just genuinely feel that that's what you do when you're an artist: You stick up for the people around you.

I imagine that's draining, emotionally and physically. How do you manage that work and still do all the other things you do?

I guess I don't really think about it that way, you know? This thing that I do with caring about the message in my music, it's not separate from my work as a commercial artist; they're totally one and the same. I'm always going to be thinking about what my voice means. When I was 22, putting out my first couple records, I was a baby  and nobody really views you as any type of role model or anything. But as you get older, you realize that you have the attention of a lot of young people. And you think, ""OK, well, what should I say now? What can I say that will be impactful in a positive way?""

You know, just bringing it back to ""Til It Happens To You"": What happened to me happened 10 years ago. And then I became famous like overnight, it felt like, and I never really had time to deal with my issues. As soon as you start to make money selling your music, there's a lot of people around you that are very excited about what you have to offer financially to business, and they start to maybe forget that there's a person underneath all of that. [So] my team now, they spend every day making sure that I am healthy and happy and that I am able to focus on the things that I love.

We have to talk about David Bowie and your tribute to him at the Grammys this year. He's somebody you've been compared to in some ways: constantly reimagining yourself, testing the boundaries of presentation. Your performance actually used computer graphics to draw his famous lightning bolt on your face as you sang. How did you get to this point?

YouTube

Well, the moment that I saw the Aladdin Sane cover for the first time, I was 19 years old, and it just changed my perspective on everything, forever. It was an image that changed my life. I remember I took the vinyl record out of the casing and I put it on my vinyl player  which was on my stovetop in my kitchen, because I was living in this really tiny apartment and I had my turntable on my stove. ""Watch That Man"" came on and, I mean, that was just the beginning of my artistic birth. I started to dress more expressively. I started to go to the library and look through more art books. I took an art history class. I was playing with a band.

I guess what I'm trying to tell you is, my friends and I in New York, we've lived a lifestyle of total immersion in music, fashion, art and technology since we were kids  and this is because of him. I just would never be here, or have the philosophy that I have, if I didn't have someone to look up to that you know blew my mind so intensely. You know the way that Nile Rodgers talks about Coltrane, and the way that Coltrane makes him think about jazz? That's how David Bowie is for me. You meet or see a musician that has something that is of another planet, of another time, and it changes you forever. I believe everyone has that, don't you? That one thing you saw as a kid that made you go, ""Oh, okay. Now I know who I am.""

How do you feel now that the tribute is over? I mean, it had to come together so quickly, and it was so complex and had so many layers to it.

How do I feel now that it's over? I mean, I feel like my whole career is a tribute to David Bowie.

So it's not! It's ongoing, right?

It's still going. I've been watching his videos all day long, and also listening to Blackstar, his last album, which is a truly incredible piece of music. It's one of the single greatest things an artist has ever done: making a masterpiece album that is their own eulogy. Can you imagine? To go into the studio every day and put your heart in that place, where you are saying goodbye to life? I mean, his art made him strong.",[]

The National Park Service wants you to get out into nature.

But the success of campaigns like the National Park Service's Find Your Park and others from state tourism offices has created a huge demand. Last year, a record 305 million people visited national parks. As the Park Service likes to point out, that's more people than went to every single Disney park, NFL, NBA and MLB game and NASCAR race combined.

Zion National Park  famous for its jaw-dropping, red sandstone cliffs and colorful panoramic views  recently had lines 300 deep just to get on a shuttle bus that goes from the park to the visitors center.



Last year, Zion in southern Utah set its own record. Nearly 4 million people squeezed into this 6-mile-long canyon, most coming between March and November.

No, thanks, says Norma Dunton, who made a point to plan her recent trip for a weekday, in winter, when crowds tend to thin out. She is worried about the future of these protected places.

""They have to save the parks. Our children need to have to have this connection with nature,"" Dunton says.

Dunton has been coming to Zion to hike for 40 years, and every year she says the congestion gets worse.

""As much as I don't like the idea of reservations to get into the parks, but, it would be worth it to save the parks if that's what they have to do,"" Dunton says.

Pretty much every idea is on the table right now for some of the country's oldest and most popular parks like Zion: reservations, phased entries for cars, daily caps on visitors.

Jack Burns is in charge of crowd management at Zion. He's standing at one of the worst pinch points in the canyon: the popular Temple of Sinawava.

""Zion was never designed to see, literally, millions of people,"" Burns says.

About 15 years ago, traffic and air pollution got so bad here that the park banned cars at certain times. Now Zion's mandatory shuttle system is held up as an example of how parks can better manage crowds. But it is getting stretched to its limit.

""We also realize that we are looking at a capacity issue here,"" Burns says.

At extremely busy parks like this, managers are starting to talk about turning people away at the gates. This is where things get sticky. The mission of the Park Service is to keep these public lands open and accessible. More visitors getting out into nature is a good thing. But it's straining infrastructure. There's a nearly $12 billion backlog on maintenance. Search and rescue teams are understaffed.

And the number of human-wildlife conflicts is on the rise.

So are we loving our national parks to death?

""We're running out of room for people to have these wonderful experiences, and the agency and the partners of the agency are going to have to do a great job of figuring this out and probably figuring it out pretty soon,"" says Joan Anzelmo, a retired park superintendent in Jackson, Wyo. She's now with the Coalition to Protect the National Parks.

Anzelmo says we're getting used to having to make reservations for concerts or other popular activities, and we might need to start thinking that way for some of our most popular national parks.

""If we want to have these places for another 100 years and beyond, you might not be able to do everything at the same time. There may need to be certain kinds of modest limits on what you can do or how you can access certain areas of a national park,"" she says.

i toggle caption Kirk Siegler/NPR Kirk Siegler/NPR

For this, the Park Service's centennial year, one of its main strategies is to try to divert people to other, less visited parks. So instead of going to Zion, have you considered Capitol Reef next door or maybe the Great Basin in Nevada? Or if you do go to Zion, why not go now, beat the crowds?

That was Chung Kim's plan. He's taking his parents who are visiting from Korea on a winter swing through the national parks of the Southwest.

""We've been to Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, and this [Zion] is like, my third national park here. I like this national park the best,"" he says.

In Korea's national parks, Kim says, people regularly line up just to get on a hiking trail.

So to his parents, the gorgeous open valley where the Virgin River dumps out of a narrow slot canyon looks like pristine wilderness, Kim says.

""Still less crowded than in Korea, so, they like it here,"" he says.",[]

A BBC journalist tweeted Wednesday that Queen Elizabeth II had been admitted to King Edward VIIs Hospital in London, leading at least one other major news outlet  CNN  to tell its affiliates that the queen had been hospitalized and setting off speculation that she had died.

The queen is apparently fine and is not in the hospital. The backstory, according to the BBC, is that it was conducting a technical rehearsal for an obituary and tweets were mistakenly sent from the account of a BBC journalist.

The BBC has apologized. CNN, which tweeted the news without citing any source, subsequently told affiliates to please disregard our previous tweet about Queen Elizabeth. It was sent in error.

We should note that there but for the grace of God go we. But this is also a reminder of why, as the Ethics Handbook says, we do not just spread information we see on social media, even if its posted by usually reliable news outlets. We are careful and skeptical.

Heres part of what we say in the handbook:

When determining whether to pass along information being reported on social media sites by other news outlets or individuals, be thoughtful. When we point to what others are saying, in the eyes of many we are effectively reporting that information ourselves. ... Above all, proceed with caution, especially when news is breaking and accounts vary widely about what is happening. Reach out to other sources for confirmation. And the general standard is simple: Tweet and retweet as if what youre saying or passing along is information that you would put on the air or in a traditional NPR.org news story. If it needs context, attribution, clarification or knocking down, provide it. News moves fast on the Internet, and we know that speed and accuracy are fierce rivals, so keep your guard up. Ask questions, report and engage as you would in any public setting. But remember that everything you say or do in a social media environment is effectively a public statement from an NPR journalist, so dont pass along inaccurate information.

i toggle caption Theo Wargo/Getty Images Theo Wargo/Getty Images

On Friday night, I finally got to see Hamilton, the critically acclaimed musical I've been surprisingly obsessed with since Frannie Kelley's glowing write-up of the cast album last fall.

I say ""surprising"" because I am not a fan of musical theater, the kind of not-a-fan-of-musical-theater who pointedly self-describes as such should musical theater come up in conversation. But there I was, gripping my seat, as Leslie Odom Jr., the virtuoso who plays Aaron Burr, stood onstage by his lonesome in ""Wait For It,"" my favorite song in a show lousy with fantastic songs.

That number, all about frustrations and ambition and jealousy and doubt, knocked me on my ass the first time I heard it on the album,  like, wtf, do I actually like musicals now?  and the live experience was equally overwhelming. I'd read somewhere that Odom and other cast members regularly focus their attentions on particular audience members while performing, and I'm 95 percent sure that Odom was looking dead at me in the sixth row, as I mouthed along all the words to his song. Just two Philly dudes separated by a few dozen feet and a gaping chasm of musical ability sharing this moment of real connection.

I told my colleague/friend Stephen Thompson, who was with me that night, about this during intermission, and he joked that it was probably because Odom and I seemed to be the only black guys in the theater that night. We laughed, but it was hard not to notice that while Hamilton has been hailed for deliberately casting actors of color as some of America's most venerated Dead White Men, and ""reclaiming the American story ... for the people whom history habitually forgets,"" the actors onstage seemed to make up the majority of brown people in the house the night I went.

This is of course an unscientific study, based on me craning my neck and looking around the room, but three other folks who've seen the show recently tell me the audience was overwhelmingly white when they went, too. Yesterday, I asked folks on Twitter who've seen the show to share their experience, and many of them told me the same thing.

I'm avoiding making a too-obvious ""Great White Way"" joke here, but it seems these observations track with Broadway audiences in general; according to The Broadway League, the trade association for the Broadway theater industry, nearly 8 in 10 people who saw Broadway shows in 2014-2015 were white and in their mid-40s. (That's more diverse and a decade younger than NPR's audience, for the record.) About 80 percent had college degrees and about 40 percent had graduate degrees.

Now, I'm not arguing that black and brown folks ""should"" go to Broadway shows, and there is, of course, lots of theater, far from Broadway, that caters to audiences of color. But it's worth asking why this ostensibly uber-POC-friendly phenomenon isn't consistently pulling a notably black and brown audience.

A bunch of folks in the Twitter conversation yesterday suggested that who goes to Broadway shows is a simple matter of dollars and cents. James McMaster at HowlRound recently made a similar assertion about Hamilton, which you pretty much can't see without parting with a couple of hundred bucks:

The exorbitantly high ticket prices coupled with the perpetually sold-out status of the production prohibit most working class people of color from attending the show. Given that the production's audience, then, is overwhelmingly white and upper-middle-class, one wonders about the reception of the show's racial performance. How many one-percenters walk away from Hamilton thinking that they are on the right side of history simply because they exchanged hundreds of dollars for the opportunity to sit through a racialized song and dance? My guess: too many.

This is a compelling argument, but then again, nearly half a million folks book flights and hotels and tickets for EssenceFest in New Orleans each year. Then there's the mad rush a few weeks back for tickets for Beyonce's surprise tour. That is to say, there's a whole lot of pricey entertainment that people of color are willing to drop serious dough on, but Broadway shows like Hamilton don't seem to rate. Money matters, of course, but it's not the whole story.

When it comes to race and Broadway audiences, a big part of the story seems to be acculturation. Theater has a long history of segregated seating and plays chock full of racist caricatures that meant black folks, in particular, never warmed to Broadway. ""Theatergoing on Broadway is supported by families who collected programs going back 50 or 80 years,"" James Hatch, the co-author of A History of African American Theatre, told WNYC in 2012. ""Blacks did not have that tradition, and apparently still don't.""

That plays out today in the important, subtle social cues about who belongs. It's hard enough getting comfortable in a social space when you're unfamiliar with its rules and conventions. It's even harder when you're aware of how much you stand out. At Broadway shows like Hamilton, you get the honor of having that experience for a few hundred dollars. Even as Hamilton exceeded my impossibly high expectations, I felt a vague unease sitting there that night, like I was at a hip-hop show where my favorite group was performing, but I might get shushed for rapping along too loudly. (But c'mon, y'all: HERCULES MULLIGAN!)

Not being a regular theatergoer or a Broadway vet meant I didn't know exactly how to be in the audience. I was unfamiliar enough with the ritual and customs of that space to be worried that I might be doing it wrong somehow. Could that disconnect be keeping folks who might shell out comparable cash for Bey, even if it means traveling to another city, from doing the same for Hamilton? Something I've been chewing on, and sound off on Twitter if you think I'm wildly off-base here.",[]

But it granted actor Ben Afflecks request that it not mention his slave-owning ancestor. Affleck says he was embarrassed by the discovery and didnt want any television show about my family to include a guy who owned slaves.

For the record, the decision made by Finding Your Roots was not in line with our standards.

PBS ombudsman Michael Getler has had some things to say about what happened:

 Any serious program about genealogy, especially dealing with celebrities, cannot leave out a slave-owning ancestor.  This censorship should have been stopped cold and mistakes should have been admitted publicly.

Over the past few decades, New York City has become safer, richer and a lot more crowded than it used to be. All over Manhattan these days, you can see apartment buildings going up  and yet finding a decent place to live has become tougher than ever.

""We are in an official housing crisis, period, in New York City,"" says Alicia Glen, New York City's deputy mayor for housing and development. ""Our population is growing much more rapidly than our housing stock and so we have a really imbalanced housing market.""

Mayor Bill de Blasio has proposed a plan to ease the housing shortage, but it's encountering opposition from some of the people hit hardest by the shortfall.

According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, New York is the fourth most expensive state to rent a two-bedroom unit. In a city where most people rent, the apartment vacancy rate now is just 3 percent.

Glen says in recent years, a lot of new people have moved into the city and there are more single people living alone. Changes in rent control laws caused the city to lose 250,000 affordable apartments over the past few decades, leading to an even tighter market.

But the problem of affordable rents is not just in New York. The Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies found a record number of ""cost-burdened"" households in 2013 nationally, and the NLIHC reports that the cost of housing has continued to rise as incomes for minimum-wage and low-wage workers have stagnated.

And as the housing crisis forces middle-income earners to migrate out of cities, the low-income earners find themselves being pushed out by newcomers.

A City Too Expensive To Live In

David Infante and Simon Keyes are two buddies from college in their 20s with pretty good jobs. Not long ago, they spent three days looking for an apartment in lower Manhattan. Keyes says they wanted two bedrooms and a dishwasher and they didn't want to walk up too many flights of stairs.

""We didn't want to spend more than ... $1,400 per person was the absolute limit and those things combined with the dishwasher made things pretty hard in New York City,"" he says.

Eventually they found something in their price range, but it was in a gritty part of Brooklyn, across from a hospital where they often hear sirens. Infante says he expected to have trouble finding a place to live in New York. It's almost part of the glamour of the place, but it wears you down.

""If you sort of did an exit poll on people who did five years in New York, 10 years in New York and decided to get out, housing and the constant runaround of it would probably be something that everyone cites, or at least most people,"" Infante says. ""That's something that will probably ultimately drive me from New York, for example.""

In New York, after controlling for inflation, median rents have increased 12 percent in eight years  at a time when incomes are up just 2 percent, says Ingrid Ellen, professor of public policy and urban planning at New York University.

""Low-income households are struggling to pay their rent in every city in the United States,"" Ellen says. ""And what really makes New York City stand out is that moderate-income renters are struggling.""

City officials are worried that a lot of people will be driven from the city. Landlords typically demand that prospective tenants have $40,000 in annual income for every $1,000 in rent, which means a six-figure income will get you a pretty nice one-bedroom in much of Manhattan and Brooklyn.

""It may be hard for somebody who lives in the Midwest or the South to believe that you could make $100,000 a year here and have a family of four and not be able to find an affordable place to live,"" says Glen, the deputy mayor. ""But a $100,000 a year could be a teacher and a nurse, and those people are the lifeblood of New York City.""

Glen says new housing is being built in New York, but the high cost of construction and land makes it hard for developers to earn a profit except at the high end.

Douglas Wagner, an executive at a real estate firm in New York, says even as competition for affordable housing surges, there is an oversupply of expensive apartments  places that start at $8,500 a month.

""Now especially in better buildings, there are a lot of empty apartments looking for tenants and for the first time in some time, offering major incentives to get tenants to take apartments at this level,"" he says.

A Plan To Increase Affordability

i toggle caption James Keivom/New York Daily News via AP James Keivom/New York Daily News via AP

Mayor de Blasio has a plan to ease the housing shortage by rezoning some neighborhoods to allow more construction and requiring developers to build more affordable housing.

Bedford-Stuyvesant is a neighborhood in Brooklyn once synonymous with crime and urban neglect. Now, it attracts a lot of young people who move there in search of affordable rents. BRP Cos., a real estate developer, is taking advantage of the opportunity.

""There had been a lot of disinvestment, but the bones were there and it was a close commute to Manhattan and we just thought it was a good bet for development,"" says Andy Cohen, director of the company.

BRP is a for-profit company, but many of the apartments it builds are set aside for low- and moderate-income people with the help of tax credits and other government programs.

Using developers like BRP, the de Blasio administration plans to build or preserve some 200,000 affordable apartments.

""We put together what has been characterized as the most ambitious and comprehensive affordable housing plan in the country by far,"" Glen says.

The plan would harness some of the intense development pressure sweeping the city. The mayor wants to rezone neighborhoods like Bedford-Stuyvesant to make it easier for private developers to build by modifying some of the zoning regulations that drive up costs, such as building height restrictions or the requirement that apartment buildings have underground garages.

Jerilyn Perine, executive director of nonprofit Citizens Housing and Planning Council, says a lot of these regulations are obsolete.

""Department of City Planning now is really trying to sort of step back and say there were things that were done, particularly in the mid-'80s, they were good ideas, they were helpful then. But now we really need to make sure that we can add to our housing stock,"" she says.

In exchange, the city would force developers that want to build in the city to construct more affordable apartments, Glen says.

""It's both attacking it from a supply-and-demand perspective, but then saying the market alone will not actually solve this problem,"" she says. ""We need to aggressively subsidize and use every tool we have to make sure that we're bringing on enough affordable housing.""

But the plan is encountering opposition from some of the people hit hardest by the housing shortage.

Gentrification At The Heels Of Development

The housing shortage is driving more and more middle-income New Yorkers into the further reaches of Brooklyn and Queens, bringing a new wave of gentrification that threatens to displace a lot of low-income people from those neighborhoods.

The mayor's plan has encountered opposition in some of the poorest neighborhoods. The buildings, like a BRP apartment in Brooklyn called the Bradford, are designed to house people of different income levels. Gone are the days when large projects were built to house huge groups of poor people.

""We think generally it's better to have a mix of incomes living in a neighborhood rather than either a low or high income because you just get a more vibrant community,"" Cohen says.

The Bradford houses some very poor people, but the largest group of tenants is moderate income, which in New York can mean an annual salary of $120,000 for a family of four. The rent they pay to live there can reach $2,400 a month. That puts it well out of reach for a lot of the neighborhood's poorest residents.

Rachel Rivera, a mother of six, showed up at a town hall meeting in East New York to protest the mayor's plan. Rivera lives on disability. She says local landlords are already pushing people out of their apartments to lure newcomers with higher incomes and she worries that there won't be enough apartments for people like her under the rezoning plan.

""What I'm worried about is that I get pushed out and I won't be able to afford these 'affordable housing' that they say that they're going to put up,"" she says.

City officials are aware of concerns like Rivera's. But they say allowing a mix of incomes is the best way to make sure buildings stay economically viable. They also say that by replacing some of the city's low-rise neighborhoods with higher-density apartment towers, they will ultimately be able to build more low-income housing.

As a wave of development pressure is washing over New York, the challenge now is to channel that pressure to build the kind of city that New Yorkers want.",[]

toggle caption Dr. P. Marazzi/Science Source

Medicare is going to test new ways to reimburse doctors for medications, in hopes they'll choose less expensive drugs.

The plan would alter Medicare Part B, which pays for medicines administered in doctors offices or outpatient hospital clinics  to eliminate incentives for doctors to use the most expensive drugs.

The changes would have an outsize effect on cancer doctors and clinics. Medicare Part B shelled out about $7.8 billion on cancer drugs in 2014, or 42 percent of its total spending on drugs that year.

The program now reimburses the doctors or clinics for the cost of the medication plus a 6 percent fee. That means doctors and hospitals earn more money when they use pricier drugs.

As it is now, Dr. Patrick Conway, chief medical officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, called the reimbursement structure ""perverse.""

""We've heard from oncologists who feel pressure from their health system to pick higher cost drugs even when they are not appropriate for a patient,"" he said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.

The agency plans to test a reimbursement formula that would pay the cost of the drug, plus a 2.5 percent surcharge and a flat fee of $16.80.

Under the current system, a doctor earns just 60 cents for administering a $10 medication. An equivalent drug that cots $1,000, however, would bring in $60. Under the proposed formula, the cheaper drug in this example would generate a payment of $16.93 and the second one $41.80, according to CMS.



CMS officials say that change would mostly eliminate the incentive to choose a high priced drug over one that may be more appropriate. Medicare Part B spent about $20 billion on outpatient medicines last year.

""We're trying to align the incentives to what's best for patients and doctors,"" Conway said.

The Medicare Part B plan would also reduce or eliminate the share of the drugs' costs that patients have to pay.

Dr. Peter Bach, director of The Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, says research shows doctors prescribe higher priced drugs when they bring in more profit.

""It is refreshing to see Medicare move towards an experiment where they pay for drugs using a flat fee reimbursement, where what doctors and hospitals make is related to giving the drug, not how much it costs,"" Bach said in a statement to Shots.

But other cancer doctors aren't so thrilled.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology opposes the CMS proposal. The proposal could have a major effect on oncologists because many cancer patients receive their chemotherapy treatments in doctors offices or clinics.

""It is inappropriate for CMS to manipulate choice of treatment for cancer patients using heavy-handed reimbursement techniques,"" said ASCO CEO Allen Lichter in a statement posted on the physician group's website.

ASCO, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association and about 100 other physician and advocacy groups sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell last week opposing the payment changes.

""We believe that this type of initiative, implemented without sufficient stakeholder input, will adversely affect the care and treatment of Medicare patients with complex conditions,"" the letter said.

The agency plans to field test the new reimbursement formula, as well as a handful of others ideas, in different regions of the country starting later this year. CMS will then compare the results to determine which changes are effective at reducing drug spending.

CMS is also planning to test a handful of so-called value-based pricing ideas. The first would pay for drugs according to how well they work.

For example, if a cancer medication is very effective in eliminating a specific tumor, but is also used on a second, different condition with less success, Medicare will pay less when it is used for the second condition than the first. Sloan Kettering's Bach, who served as an adviser to CMS on cancer policy in 2005 and 2006, argued for varying payments for drugs this way in a 2014 paper published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association. The approach is called indication-based pricing.

The agency also plans to work with drugmakers to link prices to patient outcomes, perhaps paying less for medications when patients end up being admitted to a hospital.

Private insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been testing similar ideas.

Cigna last month said it had agreed with drugmaker Novartis on a pay-for-performance deal for the heart failure drug Entresto. Under the agreement, Cigna will pay less if patients taking the medication are hospitalized for heart failure.

And Express Scripts, the biggest manager of pharmacy benefits, says it's working with cancer drug manufacturers to pay indication-based prices that tie cost to how well the drugs perform.

The CMS proposal is open for public comment until May 9. Conway said the field tests will begin after the comment period is complete.",[]

Florida is the next prize on the GOP primary calendar with 99 delegates at stake. Most polls show Trump in the lead. Florida is Marco Rubio's home state but analysts don't expect him to eke out a win.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Two more huge prizes loom in the presidential campaign next week. One is Ohio, where Gov. John Kasich hopes at last to win a state. Another is Florida, where immense amounts of money are being spent - we're told - to challenge Donald Trump and support home state Sen. Marco Rubio. NPR's Asma Khalid is in Miami. She's been following both the Trump and Rubio campaigns. Asma, good morning.

ASMA KHALID, BYLINE: Good morning, Steve.

INSKEEP: I hope it's nice in Miami. How organized is Donald Trump in Florida?

KHALID: You know, I think that's been the perennial question about the Trump campaign is how organized is he anywhere? And thus far I don't know that that's mattered. But I will say in Florida so far I have been fascinated by how organized he does seem to be. You know, folks here say that this is kind of like a second home for him. He has a bunch of properties here. And he also started coming to the state months ago. And these were not, you know, just small visits to a retirement community here and there. These were massive rallies as far back as October. And I think the other thing that's really interesting is that he made some strategic hires early on. And he's connected to people who know grassroots organizing in the state. You know, for example, his deputy director used to be the data director for the state party. And so he made these key hires. And I think that's helped him so far.

INSKEEP: And when you say data director, you are alluding to what we're talking about. Do you have names of people who could be supporters? Do you have an organization to phone them or knock on their doors? Are you reaching out to people? Do have prominent Republicans on your side? That's what Trump is trying to do. What about on Rubio's side? Obviously he's the home state guy. Does he have a good organization?

KHALID: You know, Rubio is essentially banking everything here on Florida. I was at his Miami office the other day. And there are people there phone banking both in English and in Spanish. You know, I think what's important to understand is that not only is he the home state senator but that he is really campaigning. And he has been campaigning here nonstop. You know, he wasn't even focused on those March 8 contests yesterday. He was spending the past couple of days here in Florida. And his campaign says that they're really focused on two big geographic areas. He wants to do well in the I-4 corridor. So that's the area that stretches from Orlando to Tampa. The thinking is that there's just a lot of people there and there's certainly a lot of suburban and urban voters.

INSKEEP: Yeah.

KHALID: And we've seen Rubio, you know, do better with those kinds of voters. The other part of his strategy entails a really big win in Miami-Dade County. You know, this is Rubio's home turf. And he needs his neighbors to show up in record numbers at the polls. I think that's a big question. They are - certainly they got, I think, into the game, some could say, later than perhaps the Trump campaign and certainly later than the Jeb Bush folks who had a headquarters here in Miami. But they are in an intense media blitz. You can turn on the radio. You'll hear the campaign advertising on local Spanish stations even here on the radio.

INSKEEP: OK, just got about 20 seconds left. What about Ted Cruz? Is he a factor in Florida?

KHALID: You know, Cruz is campaigning. This morning he's actually holding a rally here in Miami. He's also opened up about 10 offices in the state. And I think it would be a huge surprise for Cruz to actually be able to win Florida. But what he wants to do is he wants to ensure Rubio does not win Florida because I think Cruz is eager to turn this campaign into a two-man race, especially given how poorly Rubio did last night.

INSKEEP: OK, Asma, thanks very much.

KHALID: You're welcome.

The official statistics for shootings by police in America are bad to non-existent. The totals are under-reported, and the Justice Department admits it doesn't have crucial details such as the race of people shot, and whether they were armed.

Since the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Mo., after the police killing of Michael Brown, this lack has become an embarrassment. But that's slowly beginning to change.

KPCC Analysis Of Police Shooting Data i toggle caption KPCC KPCC

Take, for instance, the nation's second-largest metro area, where NPR member station KPCC in Pasadena, Calif., has created a database of shootings by law enforcement officers in Los Angeles County from 2010 to 2014.

KPCC analyzed paperwork from the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office, which reviews police shootings; the L.A. County medical examiner provided the ethnicity of fatal shooting victims.

During those five years, KPCC found, police shot 375 people; no officers were prosecuted. Of the people shot, about one in four was unarmed. And 24 percent of those shot and killed were black, while African-Americans make up 8 percent of the L.A. County population.

The dataset also includes a breakdown of factors such as the justifications given by police who shoot suspects.

For instance, 148 people were shot for moving their hands out of sight or reaching for their waistbands; of those, 47 turned out to be unarmed.

When Is Use Of Force Justified?

Whether that proportion seems high is up for debate. As KPCC's reporting about those shootings puts it:

""[Michigan State University criminologist William Terrill] said he doesn't think missing hands alone are enough to justify self-defense. 'If they were shooting all the suspects that reach or don't show their hands when the officer wants them to,' he said, 'I can't imagine the number of police shootings  if the public thinks there's a high number now  I can't imagine what there would be.' Los Angeles Sheriff's Department Commander Rod Kusch, whose homicide bureau investigates all deputy shootings, disagrees. 'There is nothing that requires us to actually wait and see the gun or wait to see the knife,' he said. Deputies' 'background, training and experience' with armed suspects triggers a self-protection response when a suspect's hands disappear, he said.""

American police have considerable leeway in these situations because of two Supreme Court rulings in the late 1980s. In essence, the court held that officers may use deadly force if they have a reasonable belief that the suspect poses imminent danger of bodily harm to them or someone else. In addition, officers may not be judged based on information they didn't have at the moment they employed deadly force.

In fact, on Monday, the Supreme Court bolstered the protections for officers, when it ruled that an officer in Texas could not be sued for shooting into a fleeing car from a highway overpass.

Police say these standards are only fair, and without them they would live in constant fear of being second-guessed after the fact. They say if they had to worry about being prosecuted for honest mistakes or for misreading a threat, they wouldn't be able to do their job.

On the other side, groups such as Black Lives Matter say this benefit of the doubt has gone too far. They say prosecutors are too deferential to police, and overly aggressive use of force routinely gets a pass.

Growing Efforts To Collect Statistics

Missing from this debate are good numbers. The federal government has tried  and failed  to get police agencies to report details about the use of deadly force. FBI Director James Comey often complains about how little data Americans have to work with, when debating policing and race.

Even some police organizations say it's a problem; they say the current national discussion relies too much on anecdotes and high-profile incidents caught on video, and they say better statistics would create a more sympathetic view of how police use force.

The federal government isn't about to require police agencies to start reporting these numbers, but it is experimenting with the next best thing. The Bureau of Justice Statistics has a pilot program to gather detailed information about ""arrest-related deaths"" in America  and they're going to use ""open-source data"" as a basis for their statistics.

In other words, they'll draw on information that media organizations such as KPCC are collecting on police shootings. Equipped with these numbers, the BJS will then ask police agencies directly for more information on the cases that have been identified.",[]

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. Our guest today is writer Richard Price, whose novels and screenplays vividly portray the lives of cops, criminals, hustlers and people doing their best to do good. His latest novel, ""The Whites,"" is now out in paperback.

Price wrote ""Clockers,"" the novel about police detectives and drug dealers which Price and Spike Lee adapted into a film. And he wrote for the HBO series ""The Wire,"" which was also about police detectives and drug dealers. Price started his career with the novel ""The Wanderers,"" about street gangs in the Bronx, where he grew up. He wrote the screenplay for ""Sea Of Love,"" which starred Al Pacino as a homicide detective, and the screenplay for the movie adaptation of his novel ""Freedomland,"" which starred Samuel Jackson.

Richard Price returns to the world of police detectives in his latest novel, ""The Whites,"" which is set in New York. In a New York Times book review, Michiko Kakutani praised Price for using detective work as a framework on which to build complex investigations into the human soul.

Terry spoke to Richard Price last year, when ""The Whites"" was published in hardback.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

Richard Price, welcome back to FRESH AIR. I love your writing, so I'm going to ask you to start with a reading from your new novel.

RICHARD PRICE: OK. This is from the first page of the first chapter.

(Reading) As Billy Graves drove down Second Avenue to work, the crowds worried him. Quarter past 1 in the morning, and there were still far more people piling into the bars than leaving them - everyone coming and going having to muscle their way through the swaying clumps of half-hammered smokers standing directly outside the entrances. He hated the no-smoking laws. They created nothing but problems - late-night noise for the neighbors, elbow room enough for the bar-cramped beefers to finally start swinging and a plague of off-duty limos and radio cabs, all tapping their horns to hustle fares.

It was the night of St. Patrick's - worst of the year for NYPD's night watch, the handful of detectives under Billy's command responsible for covering all of felony-weight Manhattan, from Washington Heights to Wall Street between 1 a.m. and 8 a.m., when there were no active squads in any of the local precincts. There were other worst nights - Halloween and New Year's Eve for two - but St. Patrick's was the ugliest - the violence, the most spontaneous and low-tech - stompings, blunt objects, fists, more stitches than surgeries, but some very malicious acting out.

One-fifteen in the a.m. - tonight, as always, the calls could come in at any time. But experience had taught him that the most fraught hours, especially on a drinking holiday, were between 3 a.m., when the bars and clubs started shutting down, everyone pouring out into the streets at once, and 5 a.m., when even the most hard-core animals were out of fuel and lurching off to oblivion. On the other hand, the city being the city, Billy never knew exactly when he'd see his pillow again. Eight a.m. could find him at a local precinct writing up bullets on an ag assault for the incoming day squad, while the actor was either still in the wind or snoring in a holding cell. It could find him hanging around the ER at Harlem Hospital or Beth Israel or St. Luke's Roosevelt, interviewing family and/or witnesses while waiting for the victim to either go out of the picture or pull through. It could find him strolling around an outdoor crime scene, hands in pockets, toe-searching through the detritus for shell casings.

Or - or - or if the prince of peace was afoot, and Yonkers-bound traffic was light, he could actually be home in time to take his kids to school. There were gung-ho detectives out there, even on the lobster shift, but Billy was not one of them. Mainly, he hoped each night that most of Manhattan's nocturnal mayhem was not worthy of his squad's attention - just petty nonsense that could be kicked back to patrol.

GROSS: That's Richard Price reading from his new novel ""The Whites."" Why did you want to return to writing about cops?

PRICE: Because it just finally dawned on me I always gravitate toward urban characters - street people, cops, the police and the policed because I can laugh when I write. I just love the language. I don't know how to make lawyers laugh. I don't know how to make doctors funny. I just need to feel like these people are zingers, no matter how heavy or tragic or light the subject is. I have to feel like I can be dead on.

GROSS: Why are cops funny in a way that, say, doctors aren't? They're both facing life-and-death situations - one in hospitals, one on the streets.

PRICE: I'm not saying the job is funny. I'm not saying surgery is funny. I'm just saying I know, I understand cops. A lot of the people I grew up with became cops. I mean, it's sort of like myself talking. A lot of the people in the street are people I've known all my life. I'm just very comfortable with them. And I feel like humor comes not out of being comical, but out of being dead-on accurate.

GROSS: So the main character in your novel ""The Whites"" is a cop who was demoted after he shot what you describe as a giant armed with a - with an already bloody lead pipe. And the bullet passed through that guy and hit a 10-year-old Hispanic boy and nearly killed him. So this double shooting earned the cop both a citation for bravery and a civilian review board hearing and kind of a demotion, too, and this is why he's on night watch.

So you're writing about this cop who totally accidentally shoots a 10-year-old boy. You're writing about - this is published at a time when there's so many people who are angry at police because of the deaths of young men like Michael Brown and Eric Garner. You're writing in this book about cops who have done good and cops who have done bad and cops who have done bad with the intention of doing good. And you're writing about everybody with a lot of empathy. And I'm wondering what it's like for you to have this novel about cops published at this time in our culture?

PRICE: Well, I think this time in our culture has always been with us. Ferguson, Eric Garner, the kid in the Pink Houses in Brooklyn who was shot by that rookie cop in the stairwell - things like this happen all the time. But this is the age of, you know, iPhones and cell snaps, but, you know, this has been through - God, can you imagine what it was like 75 years ago?

I wasn't intending to write about racial elements of, you know, police versus the police, as I've done in the past. But now that Eric Garner's happened, that Ferguson has happened, I feel people ask me, well, is this what your book's about? And frankly, it isn't. If I were to write a book that was inspired by the Eric Garner incident, I would not have used a pen name because that would be a book, like many of my others, that is talking to a larger ailment in the culture.

What I intended to write was a tight urban thriller where what you see is what you get. And for me, it was a very different kind of book. Of course, it resonates now, I mean, because - you know, because of the media blow-up over the latest types of incidents. But they were not in my mind when I was writing this book.

GROSS: Having spent so much time with cops and written so much about cops, I'd be curious to hear what it's been like for you to follow the news of those stories and to see how it's affected cops, how it's affected people who are so angry about the deaths of these young men.

PRICE: Well, my thoughts go to two places. One is that when cops are attacked, they close ranks. I mean, I'm not talking about the blue wall of silence, but I think what happens is us versus them. And I'm talking about incidents which the cops - like Ferguson, where an unarmed man was shot. When they get under attack with the media, they just close ranks. It's like Cape Buffalo, you know, when they see lions out there. You know, they're going to form a phalanx like Roman soldiers.

The other thing is that I think there are certain sub-climates of cop culture in which a city like Cleveland, which also - it was bad news that a guy shot an unarmed 12-year-old kid - or cities like Ferguson. Or, you know, as many cops have told me, Staten Island is an island unto itself, very unlike Manhattan Island, where I think the cops are insulated, you know, and have their own culture. And it's - they've always been this way. You know, it's like from time immemorial.

When cops feel isolated, when cops feel like there's nothing attacking their infallibility because the culture and the politicians around them, they kind of feel like they're in a world of their own, that they're the sheriffs. And what they do is what they do. And I think that is what you've been seeing, you know, in various places. They just close ranks, and honestly, they're feeling like it's been this way since time immemorial here in Cleveland. You know, how are we to be different?

GROSS: Right. You have so much empathy for all the characters in your books - for the cops, for some of the criminals, for the families of people who have been killed. Does that kind of empathy come naturally to you?

PRICE: I feel if you're going to write about a, quote, unquote, ""villain,"" and you make him just a villain, you know, might as well make a movie for, you know, the old 42nd Street movie strip. I mean, what's interesting is the gray. No one is all one way. Everybody became that way over the course of their life. And to just see them on the surface as the bad guy or the good guy - it's all paper tiger land. I mean, yeah, that's what makes a novel - the complexity of the characters.

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR, and if you're just joining us, my guest is Richard Price, who has a new novel is called ""The Whites."" Why don't you explain what ""The Whites"" are? It's not a racial reference.

PRICE: No. But given my history of writing, you know, I don't mind, you know, that it's a little confusing because any time you write about police and justice, there's always a racial undertone, you know, even if it's not addressed directly. I mean, that's the world.

""The Whites"" - I've always seen detectives. Since 1986 there's always been one guy in every precinct who's been so haunted by a case that they either knew who did it and couldn't prove it or the guy walked and the cop - it just gets inside this cop to the point when they retire, they're sneaking out all the legal boxes with, you know, all the case files, all the transcripts, the interviews and everything. And they're going to continue working on it in their basement - you know, have a six pack of beer and start making odd calls like they're still cops. They can't let go of this thing. This thing can't let go of them. And it's different for every cop.

What - in a world - 20 years of mayhem - they each pick one case that got to them. And it's rarely the goriest case. It's rarely about a body count. It's about some element of this crime that spoke to them - identification with the aggressor, identification with the victim, there but for the grace of God go I. The grieving family just feels like the family wish I had and I never had. It's a kid - anybody who touches a kid. It's an old person. The point is, all these obsessed cops with their single case that's like malaria to them, they all reminded me of Ahab. So therefore, you know, they're looking for their whales. They're looking for their whites.

GROSS: Their great white whale. Did you actually like ""Moby Dick"" when you read it, and did you read it in high school?

PRICE: I tried reading it about five times before I actually got through it. And, yeah, I think it was, you know, when I was mature enough to read it and read it like, you know, a person that had some life under their belt, yeah, I thought it was a fantastic book. It does not obsess me. It's not the book I think about all the time. It just seemed apropos in terms of what I wanted to write.

DAVIES: Richard Price's novel ""The Whites"" is now out in paperback. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're listening to Terry's interview with writer Richard Price. His novel, ""The Whites,"" is now out in paperback.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

GROSS: One of the things I love about your writing is the great details in it and things you observe. There's a character - I won't say much about who he is - but there's a character named Milton Ramos who's Puerto Rican and had been married to a Jewish woman. So he's visiting his Jewish aunt at an assisted living facility. And in her room there's a bowl of silver and gold paper mache fruit, a plaster pair of life-sized praying hands, two ceramic menorahs and a glazed and mounted ram's horn, as well as a framed print of a fiddler floating sideways above an off-balance ghetto. I can't tell you how many times I've seen those things (laughter) in the 1960s.

PRICE: Well, you know what?

GROSS: What?

PRICE: That's my mother's room in assisted living.

GROSS: Really?

PRICE: Yeah, and she's not religious, except, you know, she identifies, and she's very emotional about being a Jew. But that's - I don't think she's been in a synagogue since I was bar-mitzvahed. But, you know, the whole point for me to go out is not - you know, the obvious things are the obvious things. But what breathes life, you know, into a scene or what my eyes register or what my heart registers are the tiny things. You know that I was vaguely describing a Chagall print. I can't tell you in my mother's place - which is nondenominational - I mean, even the Christians have Chagall paintings, you know, in their living rooms. The praying hands, all that - I mean, some of this stuff is obviously made up - or not obviously, but it is. But you can't tell which is which. But it's always been about the details for me, always.

I mean, the cops used to feel - I'd come out - what I wrote about in ""Clockers"" was really small. I mean, it was a small, petty life, you know, petty crime, a routine investigation. And a lot of the cops, after the book came out, said I can't believe you wrote about this stuff. You know, we intercepted, you know, a 50-kilo cocaine shipment. Why didn't you write about that? Because that's the stuff that's - you can read about that in the newspapers. What you can't read about is that this guy who had a fearsome reputation in the street not only lived with his grandmother, but didn't have a chest of drawers in his room and kept all his clothes in a jumble, in a pile going up to his hips. You know, and that's how he chose how to dress. But on the street, he was a legend. At his home, he looked like somebody should buy him a chest of drawers.

GROSS: There's more obesity in this novel than has been in previous novels of yours, which makes sense because there's more obesity in our culture than there used to be. Was that a conscious decision to put in, you know, several obese characters and to - also there's a former cop who's now a funeral director, and in one week he gets a 400- and a 500-pound corpse. And he realizes that if he adds on the weight of the coffin that his front steps are going to collapse from the weight. So he actually has to send these bodies to another funeral home because they're just too darn heavy.

PRICE: And the other funeral home was smart enough to put in reinforced steel on their steps because they know the situation.

GROSS: Yeah. So can you tell me a little bit about wanting to include obesity and deciding how you were going to get that to figure into the novel?

PRICE: Well, it wasn't a theme in any way. I wasn't responding to anything I read in, you know, Hello or Ok or People or Us, you know? But, you know, I live in Harlem and there's an obesity problem around where I live now that is hard not to see. Like I described in the book, you'll see a Roy Rogers, a Dunkin' Donuts and a big woman's muumuu shop and then a funeral home. You know, and it's like a de-evolution cartoon. It was right in front of my eyes.

I've been living there for close to seven years now and it was - depends where. You're not going to see that kind of obesity if I was writing about, you know, Gramercy Park or Tribeca, you know, but there are other parts of the city and, [expletive], the country. I mean, like I said, you know, there are fat people in Nebraska, too. You know, and it's a national plague, but I wasn't thinking about it anymore than just making observations through the eyes of a funeral director.

GROSS: Since you mentioned you live in Harlem now and have been living there for seven years, how come you moved there?

PRICE: Because when I was with my soon-to-be wife Lorraine Adams, the novelist, she - we were sitting there one day when we decided we were going to ultimately live together. And it just came up - where do you want to live? And it just came out of her mouth - Harlem. Now, I - my experience with Harlem, even though my grandmother had been born there in the turn of the 20th century, my experience with Harlem for the last 15 years before that was going up there with the crime scene unit to - or the night watch - to process a dead body on the sidewalk. And, you know, so I had a very narrow view of Harlem. I'd just go up there for death. So when she said Harlem, you know, I thought - gulp. OK, here's this big-deal writer, this big, macho writer of ""Clockers"" and ""Freedomland."" All of a sudden, you know, his mate says Harlem, and he has to swallow a golf ball.

Then I realized she, Lorraine, had been to Iran, Afghanistan. She's been to Pakistan seven times - always on her own. And now she's with a guy - this big-shot street guy. I was just too embarrassed to say no. So I said OK. And I'm going, all right, what's going to happen? So we rent a house. I go up there. It's the first day. I'm bracing. And I can't get close to my house because there are trailers - movie trailers because they're shooting an episode of ""Sesame Street"" in the house across the street. So that was my first day in Harlem.

DAVIES: Richard Price speaking with Terry Gross, recorded last year. Price's novel, ""The Whites,"" is now out in paperback. After a break, Price will tell a remarkable story about his grandfather, who was locked up in jail a number of times. He'll tell us why. I'm Dave Davies, and this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies, in for Terry Gross. We're listening to Terry's interview, recorded last year, with writer Richard Price. His latest novel, ""The Whites,"" is now out in paperback. It's about a police detective in New York who, like a number of cops Price knows, is troubled by a killer who was never prosecuted and got away with the crime. Those cops can't forget - can't let go of those cases. The killers that got away are called the whites, like the white whale Captain Ahab couldnt stop chasing in ""Moby Dick."" Richard Price's other books include ""The Wanderers,"" ""Clockers"" and ""Freedomland,"" which were each adapted into films.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

GROSS: There are several characters, you know, like, the police and the police precinct are characters in your novel, but hospitals are characters, too. One of, you know, the main character - the main detective's wife is a nurse. You describe her as a triage nurse in the St. Anne's knife-and-gun-club ER. And I'm wondering if you've had to spend a lot of time in hospitals for friends, family, for parents.

PRICE: Well, I had an infantile hernia when I was 3, and I was born in a hospital - but not an awful lot. The thing is, if you're going to be a cop that's responding to crime scenes, you're going to wind up in a hospital about three or four times a night talking to victims, talking to the people that brought the victim in, talking to the doctors, talking to the witnesses. Every time I went out with night watch, I saw some of the finer and some of the grimier ERs in Manhattan. It's just the nature of the job. You know, you're responding to felonies. You're responding to violence. You're going to wind up in the hospital 'cause that's where your victim is, invariably. I mean, that's just the nature of the job, and to not acknowledge that would be to leaving out a huge chunk of what a night watch cop's job is.

The other thing is that in my experience - I'm not a sociologist, but I would say so many cops are married to nurses, and it's just the way it is. It's - you know, mom's a nurse, dad's a cop, or mom and dad are cops. Rarely are mom and dad, you know, doctor, nurses. And you know what? You talk about meeting cute - you know, that's where they're going to meet their spouses, you know, following up a homicide, following up an aggravated assault, you know? And you go to the same hospital maybe three times a week for a couple of months, you get to know these people, and they get to know you pretty well. And it's kind of like this medical courtship around mayhem.

GROSS: The last time you were on FRESH AIR, which was about five years ago, after the publication of your novel, ""Lush Life,"" which was set in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, you mentioned that your grandfather was locked up a number of times on the Lower East Side of Manhattan for violent crimes. And somehow I think I neglected to ask you the follow-up question - what crimes? So I'm going to ask you today. What crimes?

PRICE: Well, first of all, I might have been a little romantic and mythical about my grandfather. You know, he wasn't a killer. He wasn't a - he was a poor kid in a ghetto neighborhood of the Lower East Side. And all the poor kids, just like today, they idolized the gangsters. And he idolized the gangsters in his environment, and he started running with them. And he was a gofer for them, and one time he was collared for - he had to hide a gun after a murder because he was this 14-year-old gee-whiz kid looking up to his gods, who were 17, in the pool hall. And they said, hey, Artie, do me favor. Keep this shoebox in your closet. And he - and they said don't open it, which, if that was me, the first thing I'd do is open it. But anyways, so he just came home from peddling shoelaces on the street, he told me that one day. And his tenement apartment was flooded with cops, and they had a murder weapon and he had it. So he went away for that when he was in his - and he's also a guy who thought with his hands, you know? He was kind of like an emotional - he was a violent mama's boy in a way, where he was very sentimental and he - he just liked to fight, you know? And he liked an opportunity to prove himself, and it got him into some bad situations. And there was a time - during the Depression, he was a poultry truck driver coming out of the Hunts Point Terminal delivering chickens to Chinese restaurants. And he was fired by his boss because he took two chicks home for my mother who was probably 6 at the time. And the boss fired him, and he went down to this poultry wholesaling place, which used to be on 14th Street, you know, to beg for his boss to, you know, take him back. And the boss not only didn't take him back, but he said you're blackballed out of this industry. You'll never work again. And my grandfather lost it and beat the guy to an inch of his death. He just broke all his ribs. He was just going insane, you know, and he was spirited out of there, you know, by other guys that he knew on the job. But he was arrested in his home, and he went to a cop in the Bronx - in South Bronx - southeast Bronx. This was Vyse Avenue for those who live there.

Anyways, and he begged the cop if he could help him out. And the cop said to him, well, here's what's going to happen. You're going to go in front of a judge. The judge is going to throw the book at you. He's going to scream and curse you out, you know, for the subhuman that you are. You're going to be steered towards the door - a side door - and you're going to go out in cuffs through that side door, and that's what's going to happen. My grandfather went there. The guy he beat up was there. He was wearing an entire body cast like, you know, something out of a Mel Brooks movie with just the middle finger exposed. And the judge, you know, tore him a new one, sentenced him. He went out that door in cuffs. The minute he was out the door, he realized he was in an alley. And one second later, this cop, who was behind him, booted him in the behind so hard that he went off the ground - both feet. And the cop, after that, uncuffed him and said, if you ever make me do this for you again, I'm going to say to hell with you.

GROSS: So who told you the story? Was it your grandfather or your parents?

PRICE: My grandfather. I had a - at the end of my grandfather's life he was in - he was 86. My second daughter was just born. I realized my grandfather's not going to be around forever. And so I went to him, and I had a tape recorder. And I said, gramps, just tell me the stories again. He's been telling - I know these stories, but I wanted to have his voice. I wanted - for my kids - I wanted them to have their great-grandfather's voice that propelled me to be a writer - all these stories. And they're always working-class stories. They're always ghetto stories. And he didn't want to do it, but he did it. And he talked for two hours - every bad thing that ever happened to him. And it was all bad. It was just, you know, hard-luck Charlie stories. And he would be crying. He would be choked up about things that happened to him in 1917. And I was so tormented by making my grandfather - at the age of 86 - relive this stuff for hours. When he finally finished, I thanked him profusely and I went to turn off the tape recorder and realized I never pushed play.

GROSS: Oh, no.

PRICE: Yeah. Put that in your pipe and smoke it.

GROSS: Wow. Oh, that's heartbreaking.

PRICE: Well, it's...

GROSS: And then you couldn't - you felt like you couldn't put him through it a second time?

PRICE: No, I would never, after three hours, just say, listen, we're going to do a second take on the next three hours. It'll probably kill you. But, you know what? It's good for the kids. I want them to have this. So, you know...

GROSS: (Laughter) Oh, that's a shame. That's really a shame. But I didn't realize what an influence your grandfather was on your storytelling and your subject matter.

PRICE: Well, what happened was, my grandfather - that grandfather was an influence on me because of the drama in his life and the ways that both my grandparents had of telling stories - what happened to them. That was my maternal grandfather who had all these events in his life that were just, to me - to the little version of me - were just mind-blowing. And I never forgot. I loved hearing them again and again.

My other grandfather, who had no stories, was a Jew that immigrated as a teenager from Russia, worked as a foreman in a chrome plating factory for a living and was literate and read, you know, basically - I had somebody in my family who read all the great Russians in Russian. He was involved in the Yiddish theater as a stagehand. And I would see when I was a kid that he would write these poems in Yiddish that - was it Yiddish or Russian? I'm not even sure. It was probably Yiddish because my father would do the translating. And they'd show up in these mimeographed YMHA, you know, Brooklyn regional journals. You know, it was just this poem, and it said Morris Price. And it made an enormous impression on me. I was, like, 8 or 9 at the time. And my father was in awe of my grandfather. He really looked up to him as a learned man. And, you know, I wanted some of that. I wanted to be that guy that my father would be in awe of. So - and I always say, you know, listen, it's a good thing my grandfather wasn't a Mexican wrestler

GROSS: (Laughter) But, you know...

PRICE: You know, by Mexican, you know - el diablo, I mean.

GROSS: But it's interesting because your parents didn't have faith that you could become a writer, not because of your lack of ability but because people didn't become writers. But your grandfather was a writer.

PRICE: In their world, you know, writers are mostly coming from more comfortable backgrounds - that the family is more professional. They're not so haunted by the fact that their kid might have a number of years driving a cab, you know, that the kid themselves will feel like, you know, I've been taken care of all my life. I'm going to be OK. I have the confidence to, you know, experiment for a couple of years of my life before I go to law school, you know, if I have go to law school. That's not true on the working-class level. It was sheer panic.

GROSS: Did your grandfather who wrote ever get to read your work?

PRICE: You know what? He died before my first novel, and I dedicated it to him. And to this day I always think about - I'm at the age where you really start thinking about the people in your family who are no longer there and you're dying. You wish you could just have one more good conversation with them. You know, you weren't curious enough when you were a kid because it was your everyday living life. And you never asked the questions that became important to you once they were gone and you were older and had become more reflective. So, yeah, it always galls me - not galls me, but, you know, I feel really sad that my grandfather never lived to see my book. Then again, he might not have liked it because it had dirty words in it.

DAVIES: Richard Price's novel, ""The Whites,"" is now out in paperback. We'll hear more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR, and we're listening to Terry's interview with Richard Price. His novel, ""The Whites,"" is now out in paperback.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

GROSS: How were your parents' lives changed by your success?

PRICE: Yeah, a lot. I mean, the irony is that when you come from a working-class family, such as I did in the Bronx - where my father was a cab driver and a small store window dresser. My mother was a housewife. She had a tiny hosiery store. Later on, she was a bank teller. And these are people that were born in the '20s, and they grew up haunted by the Depression. And they never had children that surpassed them and actually went to college and had some real options out in the world. So they couldn't understand the fact that I wanted to be a writer because there's no job coming. You know, there's no context, and there's no security to validate your kid wanting to be something in the arts when you grew up struggling. So they were totally upset that I didn't take the job at Blue Cross management trainee program, which was offered to me when I graduated 'cause I wanted to go to Columbia and study just fiction workshops for two years. And it was very hard for them to accept. And when I had success after that, they were poleaxed. They weren't poleaxed 'cause they didn't have confidence in me, but they were poleaxed that something like this can work. And they, like myself, they were kind of knocked over by my success. You know, to - every time I saw my father up until his 80s, he would look at me and just say, we didn't know.

GROSS: (Laughter).

PRICE: You know, in that plaintiff, kind of shrugging-your-shoulders, like, what do you want? We didn't know. We did our best. I think - it wasn't like they didn't have confidence in me. They didn't have confidence in the situation, and they were very protective and anxious that I wouldn't wind up being a ditch digger.

GROSS: Did your success change their standard of living?

PRICE: I helped them out, yeah. It just - I mean, they were very comfortable and social people, but yeah, I helped them out financially, just enough to, you know, to keep them not looking over their shoulder for the wolf. Yeah, I changed their - you know, and you know, they're parents. They're proud.

GROSS: So you're 65 now. Do you ever think about when your parents were 65, and what you thought 65 meant?

PRICE: Oh, of course. The older you get, the more you hate arithmetic.

GROSS: (Laughter).

PRICE: You know, so - OK, when they were 65, I was like 59 or - no, I mean...

GROSS: No. (Laughter).

PRICE: You know, they're also the generation where they got young and had kids in their - you know, by the time everybody was 25. You know, I waited till I was - I think my first daughter was born when I was 37. You know, 65 meant cemetery when I was growing up. Somebody was 65 - they were my grandmother's grandmother, you know. And they were shapeless, and they would toddle from foot to foot and let gravity kick in for forward momentum. I mean, 65, to me, was George Washington if he was still alive. Yeah, but - and they say - well, I want to tell you something. This is what I've discovered, Terry. Sixty-five is the new 64.

GROSS: (Laughter) Well, probably when you are very young, you thought 65 was a world where the people in your family spoke Yiddish.

PRICE: No. No, people - my family spoke English, but they were fluent in Yiddish.

GROSS: Right.

PRICE: And whenever they started talking Yiddish, it was something I wasn't allowed to hear.

GROSS: Yes.

PRICE: And so, of course, I'm going what does that mean? What does that mean? I remember there was a bawdy female comedian named Belle Barth, and she had all these naughty albums - comedy albums. And so I'd be laying in bed. My parents and their friends would be in the living room, and they'd be listening to Belle Barth jokes. And it would be something like, well, you know, the rabbi, you know, went to the beach and was on the beach next to the nun. It got really hot, and the nun took off her top. And it got really hot, and the rabbi took off his bottom. And the nun got really hot and took off her bottom. And then the rabbi turns to the nun and says (unintelligible). It was in Yiddish.

GROSS: (Laughter).

PRICE: I going crazy. I was just running out in my Davy Crockett pajamas. What did the rabbi say? You know, but that's the story of my life in Yiddish.

GROSS: (Laughter) So you've been quoted as saying what you really want to do most - that you write for TV, you do movies - but what you really want to do is write novels. And I'm thinking much as I love your novels, why would you be so insistent on writing novels in an age when fewer and fewer people, sadly, read them?

PRICE: Well, it's all that crap. The novel is dead. You know, cable took over, you know, the novel's purpose. It's just a bunch of nonsense. You know, the novel will outlive us all - will be at our funeral.

And of all the art forms for a storyteller, everyone that pays better - screenplays, TV - there's a committee over your head that determines what you're supposed to do. You are basically writing for them to feel like, yeah, this is marketable. We can get a maximum audience for this. When I'm writing my books, nobody tells me anything. You know, if I trust my editor and have a rapport with my editor, I listen. And with my current editor, John Sterling, I listen very hard. He was the editor for me for ""Clockers"" and ""Freedomland."" But I'm free. I'm free to write what I want. I don't have to worry about whether people in Montana, you know, are going to tune into my novel. You know, it's just me writing about what I know the best way I can, answering to no one.

GROSS: Well, keep writing, please. Richard Price, it's such a pleasure to talk with you. Thank you so much for coming back to the show.

PRICE: Oh, you're welcome.

No matter where you are in Tucson, Ariz., you're no more than 20 miles from Saguaro National Park. The park and its tall, pronged, namesake cactus literally surround Tucson. There's the rounded top of the park's cactus-studded Wasson Peak to the west, the park's desert-to-forest Rincon Mountain Range to the east and about a million people living between.

But if you go around Tucson  to its historic barrio neighborhoods, swap meets or hiking trails  and ask people about their neighboring national park, you might be surprised.

""Saguaro High School?""

""I have no idea.""

""What's that?""

Darla Sidles, Saguaro National Park's superintendent, is not surprised by those responses. She knows better than most the disconnect that exists between a lot of locals here and the park next door. ""The type of people that are coming to the park versus the people just five minutes away in Tucson is really an issue for us here,"" she says.

The reason: The type of people that are coming to the park don't reflect the type of people living in the community. Tucson is about 44 percent Hispanic or Latino. Of the park's roughly 650,000 annual visitors, less than 2 percent self-identify as Hispanic. ""If we're not being relevant to almost half of the population, then 30, 40, 50 years from now, the park isn't going to matter to them,"" Sidles says.

A Call To Action

The disconnect between Tucson's minority populations and Saguaro National Park is striking given their proximity, but it's hardly unique.

The National Park Service overall has a diversity problem. There were a record 307.2 million visits to U.S. national parks in 2015, and it's fair to say that the majority of those visitors were white. The National Park Service doesn't track the demographics of its visitors, but the most recent survey commissioned by the Park Service to see how different populations groups related to the parks found that 9 percent of American visitors were Hispanic. African-Americans accounted for 7 percent. Asian-Americans were 3 percent. Collectively, minorities made up just over 20 percent of the visitors to national parks, despite the fact that they made up nearly 40 percent of the U.S. population.

toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR

""We know that visitation does not reflect the diversity of the nation,"" says Jon Jarvis, the director of the National Park Service. ""And that's a concern.""

It's a concern on multiple levels. For one, the national parks depend on public money, political support and community engagement for funding. The Census Bureau is projecting that non-whites will make up the majority of the U.S. population within the next 25 years. Urbanization is growing. And millennials are now the biggest generation in history. Add that all up and it's not hard to predict that multicultural, mostly-urban millennials ""will assume all seats of power and responsibilities for the nation,"" Jarvis says. ""So connecting to that generation is essential to the Park Service's ability to thrive in our second century.""

The other reason it's important to connect to all of America's shifting demographics, Jarvis says, is it's the Park Service's job. ""The Park Service has a responsibility that Congress and the president have granted us over our history,"" he says.

To that end, Jarvis has made increasing diversity at the national parks a top priority as the Park Service approaches its centennial. His Call to Action plan  a vision for the organization's future  states: ""In our second century, we will fully represent our nation's ethnically and culturally diverse communities.""

'This Is Not Your Space'



Figuring out why there's a disconnect between Tucson's minority groups and Saguaro National Park is about to be Cam Juarez's job. Juarez, from Tucson, is a leader in the Hispanic community serving on the city's school board. In a couple of weeks, he's going to start working for Saguaro National Park as their outreach coordinator.

toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR

Juarez getting a jump start on that by visiting a couple of schools in Tucson to ask parents, teachers, administrators and students if they know about Saguaro and, if not, why. He's also going to try to get them interested in the park and what it has to offer. ""It's like we're out there selling snake oil,"" he says on the way to a charter school in south Tucson, which is predominantly Hispanic. ""I'd wager to say that there's a whole lot of folks here that don't use the park, close as they are to it.""

In a way, Juarez is the perfect person for this job because he can relate. To date, he says, he's visited three national parks, including Saguaro. Growing up, his family never went to national parks. They never even talked about it. ""It just wasn't something we did,"" he says.

His family was poor. ""We didn't have camping gear or fishing gear,"" he says. ""We had hoes and shovels; work implements and school books.""

Even as he got older, Juarez says, he thought of national parks as a place for ""folks that were white or folks that had resources and sometimes you likened them to each other."" Either way, he didn't think the parks were for people like him.

He's not alone in that sentiment. That survey of park visitors released in 2011 found that non-whites were three times more likely to say that parks provide poor service and are not safe places to visit. And Juarez heard some of that at the schools he went to.

Oscar Medina, a teacher at Changemaker High School, talked about how he visited a park with his family ""and none of the information signs were in Spanish."" A mom at Carrillo Intermediate talked about how she wanted to go to Saguaro with her family, but there weren't facilities for a large group. Another pointed out there's no public transportation.

Some of the reasons were universal: the cost is prohibitive; not enough time because of work; the lack of shade in a desert park.

i toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR

Others were more subtle. Luis Perales, the chief academic officer at Changemaker High School, says that the reasons minorities, and particularly Latinos, aren't going to national parks is that ""spaces either are inviting or are rejecting in many ways. And I think a lot of what's been created [with national parks] is this idea that this is not your space.""

It's not that Latinos don't want to go outside. Go to any park or hiking trail in Tucson and you'll see that's not the case. It's that they might want to have a different experience in the outdoors. A lot of what the national parks promote is the solitude and quiet of a John Muir photo. ""Go out on your own, enjoy nature, don't harm it,"" Perales says. That messaging of ""rugged individualism"" doesn't necessarily work with Latinos, Perales says. ""It's like no, I'm going to bring my whole family, we're going to be loud, we're going to explore,"" he says. ""That's not what's promoted at this point. It has to be a compromise.""

'Reflect The Face Of The People We Want To Attract'

There's another reason that people gave for not feeling connected or welcome at the national parks, and it's one that many people danced around. Bella Furr, an intern and temporary worker at Saguaro National Park had no such qualms: ""The other thing is the Park Service is full of white men.""

That's not entirely accurate, but it's not far off the mark. According to the most recent survey, 80 percent of Park Service's roughly 22,000 employees are white. Anecdotally, people involved with the Park Service say, the demographics breakdown of the Park Service's estimated 220,000 volunteers is similar.

At Saguaro National Park, Sidles estimates about 75 percent of their workforce is white. ""We don't have as diverse a staff as we should have,"" she says. ""We have to reflect the face of the people we want to attract.""

That idea of reflecting the diversity of the public in its workforce is one the National Park Service has been pushing for a long time. Programs have been in put place nationally and initiatives have been launched, but little has changed. That's bred some cynicism about the service's efforts in some quarters. One former long-time National Park Service employee interviewed for this story not-so-jokingly said that the National Park Service could also be celebrating the centennial of its efforts to be more diverse.

There's a myriad of reasons park managers and officials give for the slow rate of change. There's the labyrinthian federal job application system as well as preferential hiring mandates that can keep the resumes of diverse, local candidates off of hiring manager's desks. More directly, there's low job turnover and few new opportunities for diverse candidates. With baby boomers nearing retirement though, that's expected to change and open opportunities for more diversity.

i toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR

Saguaro National Park wants to be ready for that opportunity and being ready means having young, diverse, experienced candidates for jobs as they come open. That's why they've partnered with the nonprofit group Friends of Saguaro National Park to hire a group of young locals like Yesenia Gamez on temporary contracts.

Gamez is what's called a Next Generation Ranger. She works at Saguaro National Park's visitor centers and in its interior, but she also works in Tucson, visiting local schools and working at information stands at local events.

On a recent weekend, she showed off a big bleached grizzly bear skull to a group of young kids at community health event at a park in downtown Tucson. They guessed what animal it was.

Gamez says she loves doing events like this because she gets to interact with people who otherwise don't get to experience the park. ""People that come to the park are usually retirees who can drive out there,"" she says. ""This is a low socioeconomic thing. It's in the heart of Tucson. It's kind of like we're bringing the park to them.""

By doing that, she says, the Next Gen Rangers can provide a friendly, familiar face and appeal to people where they're comfortable. They can also tell younger versions of themselves about the opportunities that exist in the National Park Service  if those opportunities exist.",[]
npr.org,2016-03-09 00:00:00,U.S. Hopes ISIS Prisoner Will Lead Americans To Chemical Weapons : The Two-Way : NPR,[],"U.S. Hopes ISIS Prisoner Will Lead Americans To Chemical Weapons

The Pentagon hopes an ISIS chemical weapons engineer captured in Iraq last month will lead U.S. troops to possible weapons sites and help prevent chemical attacks by the Islamic State.

Defense officials hope that Sleiman Daoud al-Afari will help them find storage sites for chemical munitions including mustard agent, which can blister the skin and lungs and lead to death in high concentrations. Iraqi officials told the Associated Press that al-Afari worked for Saddam Hussein's military and has long been a member of ISIS, which seized portions of Iraq last summer.

Al-Afari's capture has already led to some U.S. airstrikes against suspected ISIS chemical weapons stockpiles, one U.S. national security official confirmed to NPR.

Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Jeff Davis declined to confirm the capture of al-Afari but he talked about the chemical threat in general terms.

""We've said before that they have used chemical weapons in both Iraq and Syria, sulphur mustard specifically,"" Davis said. Anyone who's making and using weapons of mass destruction, particularly a terrorist group like ISIL, would be well advised to know that we don't intend to let them keep doing that.""

Al-Afari was captured as part of a new strategy in which Army Delta Force special operators go after Islamic State leaders with the goal of bringing them in and interrogating them about the terror group's operations. American officials are questioning al-Afari but they do not plan to detain him; they expect him to be handed over to Iraqi custody.

Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the capture and interrogation of al-Afari showed Washington's new approach in Iraq is already paying off.

""While these on-the-ground captures pose real dangers to our troops and can risk bringing the U.S. more fully into this conflict, the rewards can be great in terms of vital intelligence collected, ISIS operations disrupted, and attacks thwarted  including those which may involve chemical weapons,"" he said in a statement.

Meanwhile, Kurdish officials in northern Iraq reported that this week some 40 civilians suffered from skin irritation and choking after mortar shells with ""poisonous substances"" were fired into a village south of Kirkuk, which is under Kurdish control.

And separately, Syrian Kurdish officials say jihadists on Tuesday used phosphorous in a chemical attack on the city of Aleppo. Five people remain hospitalized.

There have been numerous reports since last summer of chemical weapons use by ISIS and other jihadi groups. Some of the chemicals have been stolen from old military stockpiles, while others amount to a homemade brew. Also, there is an abundance in Syria and Iraq of chlorine, which is used as a water purifier but can also be weaponized by placing high concentrations into an artillery shell.

Last August, NPR reported on an artillery attack on a village just south of the Iraqi city of Mosul, sickening Kurdish troops.

And recently, on the CBS News show 60 Minutes, CIA Director John Brennan was asked by reporter Scott Pelley about the use of chemical weapons by ISIS:

""Scott Pelley: Does ISIS have chemical weapons? ""John Brennan: We have a number of instances where ISIL has used chemical munitions on the battlefield. ""Scott Pelley: Artillery shells. ""John Brennan: Sure. Yeah. ""Scott Pelley: ISIS has access to chemical artillery shells? ""John Brennan: Uh-huh (affirm). There are reports that ISIS has access to chemical precursors and munitions that they can use.""

With ISIS under continual pressure by U.S. airstrikes and local forces, officials said, there are concerns that ISIS could turn more to the use of chemical weapons in desperation.",[]

Resident Connie Sawyer, 103, has lived here since 2004. She got into show business when she was 8. ""I worked in vaudeville and nightclubs. I played every saloon in the business,"" she says. She was in a Broadway show called A Hole in the Head, which caught the attention of one of Frank Sinatra's managers. Sawyer says the manager told Sinatra, "" 'You gotta buy that property. It'll make a wonderful movie.' He said, 'Buy it! Bring the author.' "" But the author wouldn't go without Sawyer, who created her stage character  a funny, tipsy gal who got lots of laughs. So the manager called Sinatra back and, according to Sawyer, ""He said, 'Bring the drunk!' ""

Today, Sawyer is still working  she did a Super Bowl ad for Dodge last year. She says the secret of her longevity is ""Move. Don't sit on the couch. All my life, I played golf, I swam. And even here, I go to the exercise class.""

Sawyer takes special swim classes for her arthritis in a pool Jodie Foster contributed to the campus. (Water therapy helped the actress' mother, and she wanted to help others.)

The Motion Picture and Television Fund is home to 200-plus residents who once worked on screen, behind cameras, in production rooms and in secretarial pools  industry people in an extremely fickle industry. Fund President Bob Beitcher says most were freelancers.

""They might be working on [a] TV series that [is] supposed to be 13 episodes; six weeks into it, it gets canceled, they're out of work,"" he says. ""They work in a feature film, feature films end and then they're out of work. So it really is an industry where you never know what lies in your future.""

The founders of the fund, some of film's greatest early stars, decided to create some stability. In 1921, they formed a fund so working industry folks could make contributions to those without work.

""That was the vision of Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith,"" Beitcher says. ""And they say that if you worked on a Mary Pickford picture, she had a little galvanized bucket on the set with a little flag on it and if you were lucky enough to be working that day, she expected you to drop something in the bucket to reflect your gratitude for getting paid for the work.""

They might be working on [a] TV series that [is] supposed to be 13 episodes; six weeks into it, it gets canceled, they're out of work. They work in a feature film, feature films end and then they're out of work.

All these years later, the industry still pitches in. Fund chairman and DreamWorks Animation head Jeffrey Katzenberg has raised about half a billion dollars in the past 23 years. The money supports thousands of industry people in need, including residents who can't afford the $3,000 to $8,000 monthly fee. It also pays for health centers that care for industry people all around LA.

Ken Scherer, CEO of the Motion Picture and Television Fund foundation, says many facilities on campus are named for the film giants who endowed them, like Kirk Douglas.

""He would tour the Alzheimer's unit that he helped build, and then he would come and have dinner,"" Scherer says. ""And inevitably a resident would walk up and say to Kirk Douglas, 'You were in my last picture.' Now that person could've been a grip [lighting and rigging technician], but in his head, Kirk Douglas worked on his picture.""

Film and TV giants have also used the campus' facilities  Norma Shearer and Mary Astor lived there. Hattie McDaniel died there, and comedian Bud Abbott came in for physical therapy.

More recently, a meeting at the campus was almost movielike: TV writer Tony Lawrence, 87, moved to the campus 11 years ago with his wife, Nancy, who had Alzheimer's. They had been married 50 years when she died. ""And that's why it was so astonishing and such a miracle to find ... someone like Madi in my life,"" he says.

Madi is Madeline Smith, 75, a former NBC administrative assistant who moved to the campus in 2014. A year later, she and Lawrence got married in the rose garden. On the couch in their small cottage, the newlyweds sit so close together you couldn't fit a piece of paper between them. This is what, in showbiz, you'd call a happy ending. Especially since neither wanted to move here.

""I thought, 'Oh no, this is a bunch of old people. I don't want to live here,' "" Smith recalls

npr.org,,"If Weve Bleeped It, Do We Also Need To Warn Listeners? Maybe Not",[],"If Weve Bleeped It, Do We Also Need To Warn Listeners? Maybe Not

Is it necessary to alert listeners that theres offensive/disturbing/troubling/etc. language in a report if weve already bleeped the nettlesome word or words?

The short answer is, not always.

Previous guidance has been too strict on this point. Lets try this:

If its been decided after discussions with senior editors that a word or phrase will be bleeped, dont assume listeners do or do not need to be alerted. Instead, consider the context.

 Is the cut still intense, graphic or disturbing even after its been bleeped? Then a heads up for listeners could be warranted. By the way, it may not have to be a line that sounds like a warning. The language can be conversational and informational (more on that below).

 Is the cut funny and a naughty word or two are said in jest? Then a heads up probably isnt necessary.

 Is it one bleep in an otherwise family-friendly piece and the word wasnt said in anger? Then, again, there could be no need for a heads up.

Basically, its a judgment call. Talk to the deputy managing editors (Chuck Holmes & Gerry Holmes) and/or the standards & practices editor (Mark Memmott). It will get figured out.

Two related notes:

 Heres the part about being conversational and informational. If we think listeners should be alerted, we dont always need to say something like we should warn you. On Morning Edition recently, there was a piece about the comic Chris Gethard. Two F-bombs were bleeped. In the introduction, David Greene said of Gethard that, Chris is funny and weird. But he doesnt shock audiences. Youll only hear a couple of bleeps this morning. That told listeners something about Gethard and tipped them off to what was coming without saying they needed to be on guard.

 Any time theres bleeped language in a piece, the DACS line must tell stations what that word is, when it appears (or approximately if were still editing) and that it will be bleeped. Obviously, on the occasions when we dont bleep offensive language, the DACS need to explain that.

Pat Conroy, adopted son of the South Carolina low country has died. The novelist who wrote nearly a dozen books, including ""The Prince Of Tides"" and ""The Great Santini,"" was 70. Just last month, he announced he had pancreatic cancer.

Conroy's books sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, and four of them were made into movies. ""The Prince Of Tides"" stared Nick Nolte and Barbra Streisand and earned Conroy an Oscar nomination for his work on the screenplay.

The boy stood on the burning deck. The highwayman came riding, riding, riding. I can still hear her voice.

She read - ""Gone with the Wind"" was the first novel she ever read to me. In her genius in reading that novel was being able to take players in that novel and compare them to people in our own life.

Melanie Wilkes was my tacky Aunt Helen (ph), who lived in Orlando. And she'd have Frank Kennedy as my Uncle Joe (ph), who lived in Jacksonville. Naturally, she took on the role of Scarlett O'Hara. And that swashbuckling figure of a man was Rhett Butler - was my father, who was fighting in warplanes in Korea at that time.

And she gave me, you know, I think my first clues that there was a relationship between life and art that was very close. And you just had to pay attention to find it.

SCOTT SIMON, BYLINE: I have to tell you, Pat - and I say this being a Chicagoan like your father - to some of us, ""Gone With The Wind"" is about the death of a civilization that richly deserved to die.

CONROY: Of course. It is. And it did. But here's what I like about it, Scott.

SIMON: Yeah.

CONROY: A girl from the place who lost outwrote all you Yankee boys and girls who wrote about the victors.

SIMON: As long as we keep the victories literary (laughter), I guess that's all right.

CONROY: You don't want it to be politically, and you don't want slavery. And I was just surprised when I went back to read it how extraordinarily good it was.

SIMON: You know, Pat, it's inescapable that - obviously, I mean, you've written a book about - you've written, I think in a number of places, including this book, that when you were growing up, you were - you thought your father might kill you and your family. And you were actually glad when he went off to war because it meant...

CONROY: I used to pray for war against places like Vatican City. I didn't care where it was, but if it would get him in the sky over some country that wasn't near me...

SIMON: Yeah. And did that - so therefore, did you find a kind of refuge in reading?

CONROY: There's no question. Dad would not hit you if he saw you reading. He thought you were studying. And it was the one time - you know, one place you could go to get away from his fists. And it worked every time.

The New York Times is reviewing some of its reporting about the San Bernardino terrorist couple, Washington Post media blogger Erik Wemple writes. The Times is looking back at a story that said Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik had talked openly on social media about her views on violent jihad.

The Times is examining the story and the anonymous sourcing for that claim because the FBI says it has not found any public social media postings by Farook and Malik that might have tipped off authorities to the couples extremist views, as The Two-Way writes. Instead, it looks like the couple communicated via emails and private messages.

Whether the communications were public or private is important. Wemple calls it a gigantic deal because the Times story went on to say that American immigration officials failed to uncover what Ms. Malik had made little effort to hide  that she talked openly on social media about her views on violent jihad. Thats a damning conclusion if the couple had been communicating in the open. If they werent doing that, the story went too far.

But this Memmo isnt just about what the Times did. Its about what NPR did.

Carrie Johnson, Dina Temple-Raston, Phil Ewing, Martin Kaste, Nathan Rott, Richard Gonzalez, Matt Guilhem, the Two-Way team, the Newscast desk and everyone else who touched the story* stuck to what we were confident we could say and avoided things that werent solid. They were precise in their language. For example, we were careful to say federal sources were telling NPR that Malik had posted a message on Facebook at the time of the shooting. That information has held up.

Most writers would give everything they own to have just one masterpiece to their name. British author Helen Oyeyemi is barely 31, and she already has at least three of them. That includes her last two novels, Mr. Fox and Boy, Snow, Bird, both of which received extensive critical acclaim in the U.S. and around the world.

It also includes her latest book, the short story collection What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours. The book contains the same sly humor, gorgeous writing and magical characters as her previous efforts. It is, in a word, flawless.

The nine stories in the book are mostly linked  characters in early stories show up in later ones, to wonderful effect. And the stories are all joined thematically; each one has a lock or key as a significant plot point. The result is that the book feels like a novel, but one that moves freely through time and geography.

The collection opens with ""Books and Roses,"" a remarkable love story about Montserrat, a foundling girl left in a Catalonia chapel with a key hanging around her neck. She grows up and finds work in a laundry, where she encounters Senora Lucy, a painter who also wears a key. Montserrat eventually discovers that she and Lucy are linked when she finds the lock that fits her key. Her reaction is bittersweet: ""She'd carried the key to this place for so long and now that she was there she didn't know where she was.""

In ""'Sorry' Doesn't Sweeten Her Tea"" (Oyeyemi clearly has a gift for great titles), sisters Day and Aisha, who are being raised by their father and his boyfriend, deal with the news that their favorite singer has been accused of savagely beating a woman. Day returns later in the funny, deeply sweet ""A Brief History of the Homely Wench Society,"" as a member of the titular club, formed at Cambridge University as an answer to an all-male student association.

Aisha, as well as some other characters from previous stories, is featured in ""Freddy Barrandov Checks ... In?"", about a young man being pressured to work in the hotel that employs his parents. Freddy is resistant to the idea: ""She wants to see good hearts and good brains put to proper use, but I'm not convinced that everybody ought to live like that, or even that everybody can.""

Oyeyemi seems to be incapable of writing anything that's not wholly original. ""Is Your Blood As Red As This?"" follows the lives of students at a bizarre puppetry school; one character is a ghost, and another, Rowan, is a ""wooden devil"" in genderless human form. ""No matter how soft his skin appears to be he is entirely wooden, and it is not known exactly what animates him  no clock ticks in his chest,"" Oyeyemi writes. ""His fellow students already had all those confusing hormone surges to deal with. So most of them stayed away, though I'm sure they all dreamed of him, her, hir, zir, a body with a tantalizing abundance of contours, this Rowan who is everything but mostly tree.""

It's one thing to write so beautifully about youth and desire; it's another thing entirely to do it in such a vividly imagined, unique setting. Oyeyemi manages to make the story both realistic and fantastical, and the characters are rendered with grace and compassion.

You could say the same thing for every story in What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours, from the subtle ""Presence"" to the chilling ""If a Book Is Locked There's Probably a Good Reason for That Don't You Think."" And even in the darkest moments of the book, Oyeyemi never loses her sense of humor  as one character notes, ""Sometimes I dream I'm falling, and it's not so much frightening as it is tedious, just falling and falling until I'm sick of it, but then a noose stops me short and I think, well, at least I'm not falling anymore.""

What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours is a lot of things: dreamy, spellbinding, and unlike just about anything you can imagine. It's a book that resists comparisons; Oyeyemi's talent is as unique as it is formidable. It's another masterpiece from an author who seems incapable of writing anything that's less than brilliant.",[]

Frozen in Time An Epic Story of Survival and a Modern Quest for Lost Heroes of World War II by Mitchell Zuckoff Paperback, 393 pages | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

Lost in Shangri-La A True Story Of Survival, Adventure, And The Most Incredible Rescue Mission Of World War II by Mitchell Zuckoff Paperback, 432 pages | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

Author Sarah Lotz is terrified of flying, so naturally every time she gets on a plane she imagines the worst. ""I imagine how it's going to smell if things start burning,"" she says. ""I imagine the thunk of luggage falling out of the compartments at the top. ... I imagine it all in absolutely horrible detail.""

All those horrible imaginings came in handy when Lotz was writing her new book The Three  the story of three children who are the only survivors of four separate plane crashes that occur in different parts of the world on the same day.

Lotz's book is part of a long tradition of travel disaster stories. After all, travel tales don't often end well: Planes crash into dense jungles and frozen tundras. Shipwreck victims spend months in rickety boats on the high seas. Survivors are stranded on far-flung islands and must overcome terrible odds.

Indeed you could think of Odysseus' long journey home in The Odyssey as just one travel disaster after another, says Eric Wilson, author of Everyone Loves a Train Wreck.

Odysseus endures ""just one test after another of his mettle,"" Wilson explains. ""Is he wily enough, is he crafty enough, is he strong enough, is he brave enough ... and the answer in all cases is yes!""

Travel disasters typically thrust people into extreme conditions. Not only is their bravery tested, but so is their moral fortitude. Mitchell Zuckoff has written about real-life stories of travelers stranded in remote locations in his books Lost in Shangri-La and Frozen in Time. He says people get a vicarious thrill reading about such perilous adventures from the safety of their homes. But it also makes them think: ""We all fly, we all get on boats  if the worst happened, how would I react? That fascinates me,"" says Zuckoff.

One of Zuckoff's favorites is A Night to Remember, Walter Lord's account of the sinking of the Titanic, which was made into a film in 1958. Lord based his book on interviews with survivors and included the haunting image of the band that continued to play as the ship went down. But these stories don't end once the ship has sunk or the plane has crashed  often that is just the beginning.

""Most travel disasters turn into something else,"" Zuckoff says, ""a story of survival, a story of bravery, of heroism, sometimes villainy. You just don't know when it starts where it's going to go because they are unexpected events.""

It is usually the survivors who are left to tell the rest of us what really happened. In Lotz's book, the young survivors become the center of a media storm. They are suspected of being aliens or harbingers of the apocalypse.

""There is something about a miracle  for example, surviving an air crash  that to us makes them extremely special,"" Lotz says. ""They've beaten death. That really fascinates us.""

Survivors often find themselves struggling not only with forces of nature but also with each other. In Frozen in Time, Zuckoff's retelling of a cargo plane that crash-landed in Greenland during World War II, the survivors proved to be heroic.

""It was amazing,"" Zuckoff says. "" ... Every guy inside the tail section of that plane felt as though: What can I give to the guy next to me? Can I warm his feet? Can I share my rations? How do I help him survive?""

But survivors can also turn on each other, sometimes savagely, as in the novel Lord of the Flies. Being trapped in an isolated place  or a small space like a lifeboat  with a bunch of strangers can bring out the best or the worst in us, says author Eric Wilson.

""Suddenly they have to work together as a team,"" he says. "" ... There's this idea of extreme behavior where oftentimes the normal guy becomes the hero and oftentimes the seemingly extraordinary guy becomes the goat. And then there's always the possibility of cannibalism. Again, the idea that something extreme is going to happen, and in the extreme context people will learn things about themselves they did not know before.""

Wilson believes writers keep returning to the story of travels gone wrong because there is something immensely satisfying about it.

""When there is danger, when there is destruction, we kind of feel like we're on the edge of life, fully alive,"" he says. ""And that can really bring out some strong prose. And it can allow us to think about some of the great questions in the universe, such as what is the meaning of suffering?""

Sometimes a journey that ends in a disaster can bring the survivor in touch with the sublime. That's literally what happens in James Hilton's Lost Horizon, where survivors of a plane crash in the Himalayas find themselves in a paradise called Shangri-La.

The only problem is ... you'd have to survive a plane crash to get there.",[]

On Super Tuesday Eve, heres a reminder: theres no cheering [or booing] in the press box.

This is very important, so were recirculating the guidance we posted last October about social media. It still applies.

Everyone should be familiar with our thinking:

The presidential campaign ... and breaking news events ... draw many of us to social media. We want to monitor the news, post our reporting, share the interesting information we find and offer our thoughts.

Thats great. Have fun out there.

But ... (theres always a but) ... all of us  journalists as well as those in other departments  need to remember that what we post and retweet can reflect on NPR. None of us want NPRs reputation for fairness to be put in doubt because of things we do on digital platforms.

Our resources:

 The Social Media section of the handbook. The introduction specifically mentions NPRs journalists, but the principles apply to others here as well. If youre in doubt, talk to your supervisor:

The Internet and the social media communities it encompasses can be incredible resources. They offer both a remarkably robust amount of historical material and an incredible amount of real-time reporting from people at the scenes of breaking news events. But they also present new and unfamiliar challenges, and they tend to amplify the effects of any ethical misjudgments you might make. So tread carefully. Conduct yourself online just as you would in any other public circumstances as an NPR journalist. Treat those you encounter online with fairness, honesty and respect, just as you would offline. Verify information before passing it along. Be honest about your intent when reporting. Avoid actions that might discredit your professional impartiality. And always remember, you represent NPR.

 Some Guidance About Social Media On Election Day. You could substitute the words Debate Night [or ""Super Tuesday""] for Election Day.

 Reminder: There Is No Privacy On The Web, And Personal Pages Are Not Safe Zones. Heres a key paragraph:

Matt Thompson offers a test. Before posting something about your work or a news event or an issue, even if youre putting it on what you think of as a personal page, ask this question: Is it helping my journalism, or is it hurting my journalism?

When reporting about or from Myanmar, it is no longer necessary to say at the top that it is Myanmar, also known as Burma, as our style has been since 2011. We feel there are very few in the audience who still need that immediate reminder.

It is also no longer necessary to include the reminder about the name Burma in every report. Use your judgment. In longer pieces, and especially in those tracing the countrys recent history, an also known as Burma is appropriate and helpful.

Meanwhile, our guidance (and APs) has been that Myanmarese is the adjective to use when describing the people of that country. You should know, however, that there is disagreement over whether that is the proper adjectival form and that people in Myanmar do not refer to themselves that way. Many authorities say Burmese is the word to use, even when referring to the country as Myanmar. One way around all that, of course, is to say something such as the people of Myanmar or the people here.

Sir George Martin, the music producer who signed the Beatles to a recording contract in 1962 and was their intimate collaborator as they together transformed popular music, died Tuesday at the age of 90.

Martin's death was confirmed by Adam Sharp, his manager in the U.K. In a statement, Sharp said:

Sir George Martin passed away peacefully at home yesterday evening, Tuesday March 8th. The family would like to thank everyone for their thoughts, prayers and messages of support.

Martin was often referred to as the ""Fifth Beatle."" He scoffed, but the band wouldn't have been the Beatles we know without him.

Martin's 1979 memoir (co-authored with Jeremy Hornsby) was titled All You Need Is Ears  but his ears, and his instincts as a music producer, were extraordinary.

A classically trained composer, George Martin began to work for the British record label EMI's imprint Parlophone Records in 1950, overseeing classical recordings as well as comedy records by the likes of Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Bernard Cribbins.

By 1962, when Cribbins' song ""Right Said Fred"" became a hit in the U.K., George Martin was running Parlophone Records and looking to sign up a rock 'n' roll band. The Beatles auditioned for him in June of 1962.

In a 2011 BBC interview, Martin said: ""They had this wonderful charisma. They made you feel good to be with them. And I thought their music was rubbish.""

Martin signed the Beatles anyway, and came to love their songs. For the rest of the 1960s, he was their closest collaborator, producing almost all of the band's music, playing piano with them, writing their orchestral arrangements and figuring out how to turn John Lennon and Paul McCartney's wilder ideas into records.

In 2011, Martin described how he'd produced one of Lennon's signature songs:

""There was one time on 'Rain' when I decided to play around with tapes, and I took John's voice off as a separate item and put it on a quarter-inch tape and turned it back to front and slid it around a bit and then put it in on the end of the song. And I played it to John when he came back and he said, 'That's gear! What is it?' And I said, 'It's you!' And I explained to him what I'd done. And from that moment he wanted everything backward.""

When he wasn't in the studio with the Beatles, George Martin produced records by British pop acts like Cilla Black, Gerry and the Pacemakers and Shirley Bassey.

In 1977, while visiting the West Indies, Martin fell in love with the island of Montserrat. He built a recording complex for his company AIR Studios there with the money he'd made producing post-Beatles hits like the band America's ""Sister Golden Hair.""

AIR Studios Montserrat was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and Martin gradually retired from recording as hearing loss robbed him of his golden ears. His final hit song was the best-selling single of all time: a year after being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, he produced Elton John's ""Candle in the Wind 1997.""

""As a whole, I've had a wonderful life,"" Martin told the BBC in 1995. ""I've met the most wonderful people, worked with the greatest of artists. I'm very fortunate. I've got no gripes at all.""",[]

The question comes up about once a week: Should we say Islamic or Islamist when referring to fighters from such groups as Boko Haram and the self-proclaimed Islamic State?

Islamist is a noun meaning an advocate or supporter of Islamism  which in turn is defined as a movement advocating the social and political establishment of Islamic fundamentalism.

Compound nouns such as Islamist fighters or Islamist militants describe who we are reporting about because they make the connection to the fundamentalist movement.

Islamic is too general. Its just the adjective formed from the noun Islam.

Steve Inskeep talks to Univision anchor Jorge Ramos about his book, Take A Stand: Lessons From Rebels. Ramos will be one of the moderators at Wednesday's Washington Post-Univision Democratic debate.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Let's meet a journalist who sometimes makes himself part of the story. He's Jorge Ramos. He's an anchor for the Spanish-language network Univision. At a press conference last year, Ramos stood to challenge Donald Trump on his plan to deport millions of immigrants who were here illegally. Trump first refused to call on Ramos and then had security guards remove him.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. Sit down. You weren't called. Sit down. Sit down.

JORGE RAMOS: I have the right to ask a question.

TRUMP: Go back to Univision.

RAMOS: It's the first time in 30 years as a journalist in the United States in which I'd been ejected from a press conference for asking a question. The only other time in which I'd been prevented from asking a question was with Fidel Castro.

INSKEEP: Jorge Ramos was eventually allowed back in at the urging of other reporters. He asked several questions although Trump gave no ground. Early this year Ramos made headlines again. He was the one who interviewed former Mexican President Vicente Fox about Trump's claim that he will make Mexico pay for a great wall on the border. Fox replied...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

VICENTE FOX: I'm not going to pay for that [expletive] wall. He should pay for it. He's got the money.

INSKEEP: Tonight Jorge Ramos is in the spotlight once again. He will moderate a debate among Democrats Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton - a race that once again is intensely interesting. Ramos has interviewed candidates, presidents and other world leaders for decades now. He's about to publish a book about his experience and his view of journalism. It is called ""Take A Stand.""

Do you think of yourself as an advocacy journalist? Is that the right phrase for what you do?

RAMOS: I have been asking if I'm an activist or a journalist. And my answer is very simple. I'm just a journalist who asks questions. The difference is that I'm completely convinced that there are few moments, important moments, in which you have to take a stand as a journalist. When it comes to racism, discrimination, corruption, public lies, dictatorships and human rights, you have to take a stand as a reporter because I think our responsibility as journalist is to confront those who are abusing power. You know, I've been reading a lot about neutrality. Elie Wiesel, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, he says, we must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. In other words, as journalist, I'm completely convinced we have to take a stand sometimes.

INSKEEP: You work through in this book an account of a time that you believed that President Obama was wrong and in fact that you feel he broke a promise that he made in an interview with you regarding immigration reform. What did he say?

RAMOS: He was a candidate 2008. And he said, you know, I cannot promise that I'll propose immigration reform during the first 100 days, but I can do that within one year. And everybody in the Hispanic community call that la promesa de Obama, Obama's promise. And he just didn't keep his word.

INSKEEP: Well, this is an interesting part of this story, though. You assert that that would have made a difference, that had he gone ahead and proposed immigration reform early in his first term that it would have passed. Do you really believe that?

RAMOS: Not only do I believe that, it was so easy to understand. The Senate was controlled by the Democrats. The House was controlled by the Democrats. And they had all the votes. And they waited and waited and waited. If he really didn't mean that he was going to propose immigration reform during his first year in office then he shouldn't have promised that.

INSKEEP: How do you think it has affected your outlook on life that you are one of this very small group of people who can call up almost anybody and talk with them?

RAMOS: You know, I became a journalist - one of the reasons why I became a journalist was because I wanted to be able to talk to the people who are changing the world. And I do learn from powerful people. On the other hand, Oriana Fallaci, the Italian journalist who died recently...

INSKEEP: Right.

RAMOS: He used to say that interviews were a war and that sometimes the interview would win and sometimes the interviewer would win.

INSKEEP: Can you think of an interview where you feel like the interviewee won?

RAMOS: Oh, many times, (laughter) many times. I don't think I win most interviews. For instance, with Fidel Castro, I only spoke with him one minute and three seconds. But I think he won because I couldn't get anything from him. With the former president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, it happened exactly the same thing. And as a Mexican, for me it is incredibly frustrating to talk to the president of Mexico - former presidents of Mexico - because I can't get to them. It is very difficult. On the other hand - I know you'll find this surprising - but it is so refreshing to talk to American presidents because they are much more open than Latin American presidents.

INSKEEP: How many American presidents have you spoken with?

RAMOS: Every U.S. president since George Bush Sr. I have been able to...

INSKEEP: And you found them all relatively open to your questions?

RAMOS: Not relatively open - much more open than to talk to Latin American dictators or Latin American presidents. When you talk to a Latin American president, they make you feel so tiny right from the beginning, right from the moment when they shake your hands. Once I - I'm not going to say exactly in which country - but I asked to go to the bathroom right before the interview and a general followed me all the way to the bathroom...

INSKEEP: (Laughter).

RAMOS: ...And waited outside. But they make you feel you really have no power. And when you have 80 journalists who have been killed in Mexico, for instance, in the last decade, yeah, you realize how lucky we are here in the United States in which you can go to the White House, talk to the president and go back to your house. And then you can take a bike ride and go to the supermarket and no one is going to kill you. No one is going to do anything against you. That's a huge difference.

INSKEEP: So as we're talking, you are preparing for a debate between two would-be presidents - Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.

RAMOS: Right.

INSKEEP: Don't give away your specific questions here. I'm not asking that. But what is the essence of what you want to know from each of those two?

RAMOS: You want to know who they really are and what they believe in. So what I'm going to try to do tonight is to put aside some of the statements that they've said and try to get to know the real candidate, the real person, the person who is behind the candidate, the person who might become the president of the United States. And it's not easy.

INSKEEP: Meaning you might not get them to agree with you but you want to push them to the point were they have to level with you about something?

RAMOS: Exactly, and then if we talk tomorrow and I was not able to put them on the defensive then I didn't do my job.

INSKEEP: Jorge Ramos is the author of ""Take A Stand"" and also of course a longtime anchor for Univision. Thank you very much.

RAMOS: Thank you.

INSKEEP: Jorge Ramos is also moderating tonight's Democratic debate between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.

Shorter frequently revisits some of his earlier compositions. But his objective isn't retrospective, or to recreate his older style. He always makes it a point to try to make his music new again.

""It's almost like as an adult to go outside and play with some other adults like they used to do when they were kids,"" Shorter says.

The man who called himself ""Mr. Weird"" as a kid is a huge film buff and loves science fiction. He's also a practicing Nichiren Buddhist, and that pushes him forward too.

""Hon Nim Myo,"" Shorter says. ""It means from this moment, from this moment forward is the first day of my life. And don't, we don't lie and sit on accolades and rewards and awards and what-do-you-call-it, trophies, Grammys and this and that and bank accounts and fame and all that. That's the worst kind of fuel that you can rely on. The best kind of fuel that you can rely on is Hon Nim Myo. You start from now.""

In this episode of Jazz Night In America, we hear selections from the concerts he performed with the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra in New York. And we visit Shorter at his house in Southern California to find out more about his many sources of inspiration.

""I always tell the kids when they ask, 'What do you think about when you play?'"" Shorter says. ""I say, 'All right, let's try to play what you wish for.' Play what you wish for. Play what you wish for the world to be.""

i toggle caption iStockphoto iStockphoto

When it comes to enjoying the flavors in food, our tongues really aren't that useful. They can detect just a few basic tastes: sweet, salt, sour, bitter, umami, and maybe fat.

But real complexity comes from a food or drink's aroma, and the main way we sense all the compounds isn't from sniffing. Our bodies actually blast scents from the back of our mouths up into our nasal cavity where we can take in the difference between merlot and Chianti, according to a study published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.

Of course, you can smell foods by holding them up to your face and huffing. But that's not quite the same as taking in all the flavors of a food. ""When we have food or drink in our mouths, [the flavor] has to be going from the back of the mouth up and into the noise  going backwards,"" says Dr. Gordon Shepherd, a neuroscientist at Yale University.

To figure out how that works, Shepherd and a team of Yale engineers and neuroscientists built a model of the inside of a person's mouth, throat and nasal cavities. Then they used the model to analyze how air flows through it. They found that molecules from food we smell, or food volatiles, pile up at the back of our mouths and throats as we breathe.

When we're breathing in through the nose, as one might do while chewing, air whips down the nasal cavity and into the lungs, creating a kind of air curtain separating the throat and the mouth. ""That air curtain prevents all food volatiles from entering the lungs,"" says Rui Ni, a mechanical engineer at Penn State University and lead author on the study. When we exhale, air sweeps into the back of the mouth and throat where that heap of volatile compounds is and carries them up into the nose.

This all happens naturally, Ni says. ""But you can only do this effectively when you breathe smoothly,"" he says. If you're stuffing food with abandon down your throat or gasping for breath or heaving, you start to disrupt that normal pattern of airflow. Food volatiles won't store properly at the back of your mouth, and they could get sucked into your lungs and pass into the bloodstream.

The other problem, notes Laleh Golshahi, a mechanical engineer at Virginia Commonwealth University who was not involved with the study, is if you inhale too slowly while eating, that air curtain doesn't form effectively. Food volatiles don't get bounced out of the trachea and then could also be drawn into the lungs.

""[Breathing] not too fast and not too slow is the key,"" she tells The Salt in an email. ""Though the faster you exhale, you have a better chance to sweep food volatiles from the back of your throat toward the nasal cavity to smell.""

Ni agrees. And so the big takeaway from this study for us eaters is this: To get the best sensory experience from your food, eat slowly and breathe evenly as you do it.

The scientists behind the PNAS study only scanned the throat, nasal and oral cavities of one patient, Golshahi notes. So there could be variability among us that might make the situation different for each person. But best practices for anyone probably include relaxed eating and even breathing.

Savoring your food slowly seems to be the way to go for other reasons, too. One study found that when dieters ate slowly, it became easier to control their food intake. And kids who are forced to hurry down a meal in a few minutes ate less and threw out more food.",[]

It's hard not to wonder: After 35 years together, what could Karl Hyde and Rick Smith possibly cook up that's new? The Englishmen better known as Underworld have been filling arenas and festival mainstages with gargantuan, gorgeous techno for more than three decades, and are at this point considered one of the most influential electronic bands of all time. They've always prided themselves on breaking molds, but they're kicking things up a notch by billing their new album as a ""rebirth,"" or clean slate  which is even reflected in its title, Barbara Barbara, we face a shining future. That's pretty ambitious for two guys pushing 60, whose closest thing to a ""hit"" was a b-side mix that turned into one of techno's all-time greatest film placements: ""Born Slippy .NUXX"" in the '90s classic, Trainspotting.

Barbara Barbara does venture into new territory, at least for Underworld. And it comes at a pivotal time for big-room dance music, whose audience appears to be tiring of bubblegum bangers, and might just be searching for something more authentic and experimental. The group's tenth studio album is certainly that, mature and compact, its seven songs exploring both sounds they would have been unlikely to touch 20 years ago (the sitar-like twangs of ""Santiago Cuatro"") and harkens back to their guitar-band roots (the electric, thrashing ""Exhale"").

In that way, Barbara Barbara feels less like a new beginning and more a reminder of how far they've come. No track reflects this quite like ""Ova Nova,"" which blends elements from some of their best work into a swirl of synths and chants: ""Everybody, everybody, everybody..."" Hyde coos in the background. ""Change your mind..."" It has the upbeat euphoria of 2010's ""Diamond Jigsaw,"" and builds gradually, in layers, like the beloved ""Slippy,"" yet its rhythm and melodies are simple and infectious. As most of the lyrics are indecipherable, it's hard to pontificate about any greater meaning (the band requests that lyrics are not reprinted), but that leaves the blanks for the listener to fill in, personalizing the experience. Either way, Hyde and Smith have never relied on lyrics to communicate feeling. This song was designed for dancing  and crying, and hugging, and all the emotional, sentimental things people do when it becomes clear the show is almost over.

npr.org,,Guidance On Music In Broadcast Pieces,[],"Guidance On Music In Broadcast Pieces

An editor once told me that if I asked 12 economists what was likely to happen I would get 13 opinions.

That line came to mind in recent days as I talked to people across NPR News about whether we do or do not allow music to be embedded in longer news stories. Im talking about incidental music that is there, at the very least, to improve the listening experience, but otherwise has no obvious connection to the story. Im also talking about longer pieces that are broadcast, not podcasts.

 No ... I was told. NPR has a rule: No music; no sound effects. We dont put anything in our broadcast pieces that isnt true to the stories.

 Sure ... I was assured. Weve been adding music for years when its felt that scoring would improve a piece.

 Well ... others said. Music can be used as a bookend or to create a bridge between sections of a long report. But it should never be layered beneath reporting.

 But ... began some. If its obvious to listeners that the music is being used in a feature in a humorous way or in a long news story to set off a particular section, its OK to run it beneath the script.

 Only ... said some. Music may be OK in features, but only rarely and with a less is more approach. That is, be sparing. Were making news stories, not movies.

There was agreement on one thing. Music cant be used in news stories to make editorial statements or to steer a listener toward judgments or conclusions. We dont do those things  just as we would not tell the audience how to feel about the news were reporting.

But, but, but ... what is an editorial statement and when is something manipulative? We cant agree. Theres a know it when we see it sense.

After all that, heres where are:

 There is no rule against putting music into broadcast pieces. Its been done and is being done every week in features or special projects. Listen to WESUNs For The Record series, a recent Hidden Brain piece that was recast for radio, Morning Editions report on How The Libyan Revolution Opened The Door To The Islamic State and the Changing Lives of Women essay from the gray-haired granny who has gone punk rock. Judge for yourself whether the music worked.

 Even those who advocate for the use of music say that because it sounds cool is not a reason to use it. Dont do this either: Add music in the hope it will make a bad story better. Theres a problem with the story. Fix it or kill it.

 Theres agreement that music must be treated like any other piece of our journalism. An informed, editorially based decision is crucial. Be prepared to answer this question: Whats that doing there?

 Were also in agreement that incidental music should not be layered beneath straight-forward, standard news stories.

 Less is more is a very important concept. Yes, theres a case to be made that we need to keep up with the times and that some popular podcasts (including NPRs) use music very effectively. But, we care deeply about principles such as honesty, transparency and fairness. Adding music can quickly raise questions in listeners minds about whether were staying true to our principles. A decade ago in Jonathan Kerns Sound Reporting, Jay Kernis said that music could be added to certain feature stories and mini-documentaries  on rare occasions. The occasions are probably less rare these days, but were still thinking that they should be carefully considered.

This isnt a thou must or must not note, as you can see. We have to take these thoughts and apply them as cases come up. That means talking to each other. Executive producers and desk heads need to be in on decisions about whether music should or shouldnt be used in broadcast pieces. They should bring in the DMEs (Chuck Holmes and Gerry Holmes) or standards & practices editor (Mark Memmott) if outside opinions are needed. In coming months, watch for training opportunities about the use of music.

NPR's Kelly McEvers talks to petroleum-geologist-turned-writer Rick Bass about the art of the short story, specifically his short stories. A collection of the short stories he's written over the years is called, For A Little While.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

The life of author Rick Bass is quite a story. He grew up in Houston and became a petroleum geologist. He would write on his lunch breaks. And then, in 1987, he moved to rural Montana and became an environmental activist. Since then, he's written dozens of books - nonfiction, novels, short stories - and won many awards. His new short story collection is called ""For A Little While."" It's a mix of old and new stories. Rick Bass says a short story is the best way to deal with the fast pace of life right now.

RICK BASS: The short story is a beautiful reservoir that you enter. You learn something, and you get out. It fits our brain. It's a unique package, a lozenge, a lens that helps us process all kinds of information. The classic short story form with that elegant, tapered shape - it's not formulaic. It's organic, and it fits who we are as a species.

MCEVERS: Like Rick Bass, many of his characters are off the grid and surrounded by nature. And many of them are incredibly lonely, and so I asked him if loneliness is the price of living so close to the wild.

BASS: I don't think it's the woods that make them lonely. You know, it's just the atoms bouncing around faster and faster. We're being called upon to respond, respond, respond - less downtime, less leisure time, less thinking time, less - no processing time. And when you're tired, you don't have energy for passion. When you're tired or overwhelmed, you don't have the resources to dream a big life, live a big life, and that can present itself in the form of loneliness - like, gee, I wish I had a community where I could just have a meal and sit down and talk for a while. Or I wish I had time to hang out more with my kids, or I wish; I wish; I wish. I think, again, it comes back to a question of time, really. I think time is the - kind of the factor here, and the loneliness - again, not landscape or externalities.

MCEVERS: It's interesting you talk about that because, you know, your stories are very languid, you know? They move at their own pace. Do you feel that they've gotten more so as you've sort of sensed this yearning and need for more time and space?

BASS: I would suspect so. That wouldn't surprise me. What I'm hungering for as a reader is the visuals, the reminders that the world is a beautiful place, and I'm just trying to bring, you know, almost a painterly illumination on sentences, on objects, on subjects. And so there is going to be more attention to the brushwork. And I think we're so hungry to have our five senses engaged-slash-re-engaged, that that's the best way to do it - is with sentences. And the stories will take care of themselves from those sentences.

MCEVERS: There's this one story. It's called ""Pagans.""

BASS: Sure.

MCEVERS: First, can you just describe what's happening in that story and tell us where it's set?

BASS: It's set in Texas on the Gulf Coast in the 1970s, a time of great cultural and sociologic change. The two boys and the girl - they're just navigating adolescence. They're navigating the interesting interface between friendship and romantic love, skipping school and going off and mucking around on the bayou in this really rich, fertile, lush environment that's got a lot of toxins in it from ship channel plumes and so forth. And...

MCEVERS: Yeah. I mean, they're basically playing with these pieces of machinery that have been sunk in the river. The river, you say, is poisoned. They've built kind of an altar out of kind of a pile of garbage, you know? And yet, to them, it is beautiful. I'm wondering if you could read a passage. You have the book, right?

BASS: I do, yeah. I'd be happy to.

MCEVERS: To set this up, the character's looking back. It's at the very end of the story.

BASS: (Reading) He wonders sometimes if there are not the ghost or husks of their other lives living still far back in the past or far below or even further out into the future still together and still consorting other lives birth from that strange reservoir of joy and sweetness and utter newness. And if there are, how does he access that - through memory, through imagination? Even now, he marvels at how wise they were then and at all the paths they did not take.

MCEVERS: The passage is so interesting. You know, it almost sounds like you're talking directly to the reader and this idea that there's another version of this story, and it's being lived out now.

BASS: Yeah, yeah.

MCEVERS: That, to me, seems like what must be the joy of writing - is that you get to think up those versions.

BASS: You're totally on it. And I would not have thought of it myself consciously, but it comes back to this idea of scale and time. You know, as a geologist, one of the mystifying and challenging things about mapping is, you know, unconformities, these vast stretches of settlement deposition that have been re-eroded, washed away. So you'll have an old formation, then the middle formation will be gone. then you'll have a younger formation on top of it. And there'll just be this missing chunk of, you know, 200 million years or something that - and you might find a few fossils down in another formation. And you might have a fault in truth that lifts up older rock up above younger rock. But there's a lot of stuff that happens that we never know about, yeah, you know, under the ground.

MCEVERS: And the fun is filling in the blanks.

BASS: It really is, yeah, and trying to connect dots from just a very few clues.

MCEVERS: Well, Rick Bass, thank you so much for your time today.

BASS: Thank you, Kelly. I appreciate it.

MCEVERS: That's Rick Bass. He's the author of ""For A Little While,"" a new collection of stories new and old. It's out now.

On page 33 of Jonathan Kerns Sound Recording theres an entry titled: Avoid Meaningless Attributions.

Beware of the overused terms officials, analysts, critics and experts,  Jonathan writes. His message: Obviously, we should push to use actual names as often as possible. But when we cant do that, its often the case that other words can be found that are precise and offer relief from repetitive references to officials say this and experts say that.

The ubiquitous experts, for example, might be biologists, historians or numismatists, depending on their specialties. (Yes, Korva, we want you to use numismatists on the air some day.)

In some cases officials can just disappear from a line altogether. Jonathans example: Instead of writing Ford officials say theyre coming out with a new hybrid car, say Ford is coming out with a new hybrid car.

We bring this up because a look back over the past year indicates were not heeding his advice.

 Officials was heard 2,022 times.

 Critics was heard 1,055 times.

 Experts was heard 636 times.

 Analysts was heard 351 times.

Our guests were certainly responsible for many of the times those words were used. But NPR officials would have to concede that critics, experts and analysts are correct when they say that weve contributed more than our fair share. Robert Siegel can testify to that. He says in Sound Reporting that he has spent a lifetime trying to pull officials out of All Things Considered.

But, But, But ...

By now, every member of the Washington desk is poised to send an email that points out they often have to say administration officials or White House officials or Justice Department officials or some variation of those words that their sources insist on. We understand. All we ask is that alternatives be kept in the mix: Top advisers, close aides and others.

Emails are probably being drafted by the business desk (which has to deal with analysts), the science desk (experts) and others.

Dave Mattingly is surely wondering what hes supposed to do when he doesnt have time for even just a few more words.

Again, the guidance is to look for alternatives. After all, not only are the words overused, they can be problematic. Experts, for instance, is both vague and often too-readily bestowed. Critics can be a backdoor way of getting in the other side without identifying them.

The old newsroom adage if your mother says she loves you, check it out, applies to information on the Internet as well.

We all know this, but occasionally we get reminders of how important it is not to trust everything we see on the Web and to be sure to do our due diligence before passing along any information we get from there.

Case in point: On Wednesday, WAMUs Diane Rehm said to Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vt., senator, you have dual citizenship with Israel. Sanders quickly corrected her, but Diane went on to say that his name was on a list of lawmakers with such dual citizenship. Sanders told her that was some of the nonsense that goes on in the Internet.

Diane later issued a statement saying she had gotten the incorrect information from a comment on Facebook.

Diane has apologized. She stated as fact something that wasnt.

We didnt learn something from this episode. This is a relearning.

We have an entry about this in the Ethics Handbook entitled Give preference to original sources. Heres what it says:

For years, NPR journalists have been cautioned by their editors that an all- too-common pitfall of fact checking is verifying facts through second sources, such as other news media outlets, that do not have direct knowledge about what they supposedly know. The problem has only gotten more serious as the Internet has made it ever easier to find what others have reported as fact. Thats why we value primary sources for our facts and we check them before broadcast or publication. And we value the work of the NPR reference librarians in helping our journalists get to those original sources (to email them, look for NPR Library in the NPR internal email address book). We value our own reporting and fact-gathering over that done by other news outlets. We strongly prefer to confirm and verify information ourselves before reporting. When reporting on events we did not witness personally, we seek multiple independent perspectives to get a sharper, more accurate understanding of what happened. And if we cant verify what others are reporting, but still believe the news is important and needs to be reported, we tell listeners and readers that NPR has not yet independently confirmed the news. Too often, incorrect information is passed down from one news story to another because of the failure of the first outlet to get it right. We strive to never pass on errors in this way.

In other words, check, double-check and triple-check those so-called facts you find on the Internet. Be very skeptical about the credibility of the sources. Get first-hand information. Go right to the original source.

Confirm with mom just how she feels.

Lost in Shangri-La A True Story Of Survival, Adventure, And The Most Incredible Rescue Mission Of World War II by Mitchell Zuckoff Paperback, 432 pages | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

Author Sarah Lotz is terrified of flying, so naturally every time she gets on a plane she imagines the worst. ""I imagine how it's going to smell if things start burning,"" she says. ""I imagine the thunk of luggage falling out of the compartments at the top. ... I imagine it all in absolutely horrible detail.""

All those horrible imaginings came in handy when Lotz was writing her new book The Three  the story of three children who are the only survivors of four separate plane crashes that occur in different parts of the world on the same day.

Lotz's book is part of a long tradition of travel disaster stories. After all, travel tales don't often end well: Planes crash into dense jungles and frozen tundras. Shipwreck victims spend months in rickety boats on the high seas. Survivors are stranded on far-flung islands and must overcome terrible odds.

Indeed you could think of Odysseus' long journey home in The Odyssey as just one travel disaster after another, says Eric Wilson, author of Everyone Loves a Train Wreck.

Odysseus endures ""just one test after another of his mettle,"" Wilson explains. ""Is he wily enough, is he crafty enough, is he strong enough, is he brave enough ... and the answer in all cases is yes!""

Travel disasters typically thrust people into extreme conditions. Not only is their bravery tested, but so is their moral fortitude. Mitchell Zuckoff has written about real-life stories of travelers stranded in remote locations in his books Lost in Shangri-La and Frozen in Time. He says people get a vicarious thrill reading about such perilous adventures from the safety of their homes. But it also makes them think: ""We all fly, we all get on boats  if the worst happened, how would I react? That fascinates me,"" says Zuckoff.

One of Zuckoff's favorites is A Night to Remember, Walter Lord's account of the sinking of the Titanic, which was made into a film in 1958. Lord based his book on interviews with survivors and included the haunting image of the band that continued to play as the ship went down. But these stories don't end once the ship has sunk or the plane has crashed  often that is just the beginning.

""Most travel disasters turn into something else,"" Zuckoff says, ""a story of survival, a story of bravery, of heroism, sometimes villainy. You just don't know when it starts where it's going to go because they are unexpected events.""

It is usually the survivors who are left to tell the rest of us what really happened. In Lotz's book, the young survivors become the center of a media storm. They are suspected of being aliens or harbingers of the apocalypse.

""There is something about a miracle  for example, surviving an air crash  that to us makes them extremely special,"" Lotz says. ""They've beaten death. That really fascinates us.""

Survivors often find themselves struggling not only with forces of nature but also with each other. In Frozen in Time, Zuckoff's retelling of a cargo plane that crash-landed in Greenland during World War II, the survivors proved to be heroic.

""It was amazing,"" Zuckoff says. "" ... Every guy inside the tail section of that plane felt as though: What can I give to the guy next to me? Can I warm his feet? Can I share my rations? How do I help him survive?""

But survivors can also turn on each other, sometimes savagely, as in the novel Lord of the Flies. Being trapped in an isolated place  or a small space like a lifeboat  with a bunch of strangers can bring out the best or the worst in us, says author Eric Wilson.

""Suddenly they have to work together as a team,"" he says. "" ... There's this idea of extreme behavior where oftentimes the normal guy becomes the hero and oftentimes the seemingly extraordinary guy becomes the goat. And then there's always the possibility of cannibalism. Again, the idea that something extreme is going to happen, and in the extreme context people will learn things about themselves they did not know before.""

Wilson believes writers keep returning to the story of travels gone wrong because there is something immensely satisfying about it.

""When there is danger, when there is destruction, we kind of feel like we're on the edge of life, fully alive,"" he says. ""And that can really bring out some strong prose. And it can allow us to think about some of the great questions in the universe, such as what is the meaning of suffering?""

Sometimes a journey that ends in a disaster can bring the survivor in touch with the sublime. That's literally what happens in James Hilton's Lost Horizon, where survivors of a plane crash in the Himalayas find themselves in a paradise called Shangri-La.

The only problem is ... you'd have to survive a plane crash to get there.",[]

Mary Lattimore is a classically trained harpist from Philadelphia who incorporates experimental techniques and technologies into her music. She has performed and recorded with Kurt Vile, Sharon Van Etten, Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth and Steve Gunn, among others; and is a frequent collaborator of Philly producer and multi-instrumentalist Jeff Zeigler. Lattimore's newest album, At the Dam, is the result of a prestigious fellowship she received in 2014 from the Pew Center for Arts & Heritage. She used the grant to fund a road trip across America with her harp and laptop, writing and recording songs at stops along the way, drawing inspiration from the locations, and letting the environments help define her work. The result is evocative, delicate and haunting music. The album is named for a Joan Didion essay about the Hoover Dam. ""It's enchanting, grandiose practicality, operating in its own solitude, even when humans aren't around,"" says Lattimore.

The tranquil ""Otis Walks Into the Woods"" was written in Marfa, Texas, after a visit to her family in North Carolina. About the song Lattimore says: ""I was traveling across the country with my great friend Natalie in my Volvo station wagon. I stopped home to see my parents in Polkville before picking up Natalie in Asheville. They live on the Lattimore family farm, which has some pastures, woods, a family cemetery, and have restored my great-grandfather's birthplace. We had a sweet blind black lab named Otis, an older dog, and he stuck close to the back door. The farm cats would sleep on his back and the other dog Gracie would nestle beside him. He was a cozy old guy. Before going to bed herself, my mom would let him inside to sleep on a blanket in the room off of the screened-in porch. After my visit, Natalie and I were driving through Louisiana and mom called to let me know that when she went to let Otis into the house that night, he was nowhere to be found. Dad went looking for him with Gracie and the flashlight, went deep into the woods to look for him, but he vanished without a trace. They looked and looked for weeks, but never saw a sign of him ever again. When Natalie and I got to Marfa, I set up to record at a friend's place and Otis was still on my mind, so I made him a song. I guess noble animals leave the pack to pass away in solitude and Otis, even being blind, found his way to where he wanted to go. It's a sad story but it's an ode to our pet.""

The video for ""Otis Walks Into the Woods"" captures a similarly peaceful, restful, elegant state of emotion. Shot and edited by Derrick Belcham, and choreographed and performed by Emily Terndrup and Maxwell Perkins. Lattimore says Belcham ""had this footage of dancers at the Philip Johnson Glass House, a place where I've played several times and I feel is an incredible gem."" The mini-movie captures a calm spirituality infused in Lattimore's repetitive, affecting music. It's a great match.

npr.org,2016-03-06 00:00:00,An Audacious Transformation Bogs Down In 'Blackass',[],"An Audacious Transformation Bogs Down In 'Blackass'

""Furo Wariboko awoke this morning to find that dreams can lose their way and turn up on the wrong side of sleep."" That's the first sentence of Blackass, the debut novel from Nigerian author A. Igoni Barrett, and if it sounds familiar, there's a good reason for that. The book is a long, bizarre riff on Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis, in which a salesman wakes up to find he's become an insect.

Furo's metamorphosis is markedly different: ""His hands were not black but white ... same as his legs, his belly, all of him."" His hair has become red; his eye color has changed to green. He's gone ""full oyibo,"" a Nigerian Pidgin word for a white person.

After realizing that he is not, in fact, dreaming, Furo panics. He has a job interview that he can't be late for, but he doesn't want his family to see how he's transformed. He's able to sneak out of the house that he shares with his parents and sister, and instantly draws stares as he walks to his prospective employer. ""Lone white face in a sea of black, Furo learned fast,"" Barrett writes. ""And he learnt how it felt to be seen as a freak: exposed to wonder, invisible to comprehension.""

Furo is shocked when he's instantly hired as a salesman for a book distributor. He encounters a woman named Syreeta, who lets him move in with her. And he befriends a writer named Igoni, who he meets in a shopping mall food court. Furo decides to embrace his new life as a white man (or mostly white  he learns, from Syreeta, that his buttocks have remained black). He changes his name to Frank Whyte, and throws himself into the bookselling business. He doesn't make contact with his family, who are trying desperately to find him.

It's obvious that Blackass is a satire; what's less clear is what exactly Barrett is satirizing. He does write beautifully, and sometimes humorously, on the topics of race and identity. Furo is initially homeless after he's hired at the company, and starts to question his previous assumptions: ""He had always thought that white people had it easier, in this country anyway, where it seemed that everyone treated them as special, but after everything that he had gone through since yesterday, he wasn't so sure any more.""

Barrett also has a lot to say about Nigeria, and the city of Lagos in particular, and these reflections are among the best parts of the book. ""Life in Lagos was locked in a constant struggle against empathy,"" he writes. ""Empathy was too much to ask for, too much to give: it was good only for beggars to exploit in their sob stories aimed at your pocket through your heart."" Barrett's depictions of Lagos are cutting, but also reluctantly admiring.

But the rest of Blackass gets mired down by the increasingly rambling plot. Furo's relationship with Syreeta is interesting, but Barrett's depiction of the young man's life at work is aimless and plodding; it almost feels like an afterthought.

It's obvious that 'Blackass' is a satire; what's less clear is what exactly Barrett is satirizing.

Perhaps the most bizarre sections of Blackass are the ones narrated by Igoni, who appears to be a fictional version of the author. (The character Igoni quotes lines from an interview he once gave, and they're nearly identical to ones from an interview Barrett did with Granta.) The character Igoni becomes obsessed with Furo's sister's Twitter account, and abruptly announces that he's transitioning to a woman. Neither of these things is ever really explained; they feel like another novel shoehorned into this one.

Barrett's writing is strong enough that it almost doesn't matter  it's an easy novel to read, very funny in places, and undoubtedly audacious. And he's capable of the kind of profundity that seems obvious, but really isn't: ""No one asks to be born, to be black or white or any colour in between, and yet the identity a person is born into becomes the hardest to explain to the world.""

It's a fascinating observation, and one that might explain why Blackass, though very good in parts, doesn't really work as a novel. Barrett definitely has great ideas and original observations, but it seems like he's tried too hard to force them all into one book. The result is a novel that's not unenjoyable, but one that never really comes together.",[]
npr.org,2016-03-09 00:00:00,'What Is Not Yours' Is Flawless,[],"'What Is Not Yours' Is Flawless

Most writers would give everything they own to have just one masterpiece to their name. British author Helen Oyeyemi is barely 31, and she already has at least three of them. That includes her last two novels, Mr. Fox and Boy, Snow, Bird, both of which received extensive critical acclaim in the U.S. and around the world.

It also includes her latest book, the short story collection What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours. The book contains the same sly humor, gorgeous writing and magical characters as her previous efforts. It is, in a word, flawless.

The nine stories in the book are mostly linked  characters in early stories show up in later ones, to wonderful effect. And the stories are all joined thematically; each one has a lock or key as a significant plot point. The result is that the book feels like a novel, but one that moves freely through time and geography.

The collection opens with ""Books and Roses,"" a remarkable love story about Montserrat, a foundling girl left in a Catalonia chapel with a key hanging around her neck. She grows up and finds work in a laundry, where she encounters Senora Lucy, a painter who also wears a key. Montserrat eventually discovers that she and Lucy are linked when she finds the lock that fits her key. Her reaction is bittersweet: ""She'd carried the key to this place for so long and now that she was there she didn't know where she was.""

In ""'Sorry' Doesn't Sweeten Her Tea"" (Oyeyemi clearly has a gift for great titles), sisters Day and Aisha, who are being raised by their father and his boyfriend, deal with the news that their favorite singer has been accused of savagely beating a woman. Day returns later in the funny, deeply sweet ""A Brief History of the Homely Wench Society,"" as a member of the titular club, formed at Cambridge University as an answer to an all-male student association.

Aisha, as well as some other characters from previous stories, is featured in ""Freddy Barrandov Checks ... In?"", about a young man being pressured to work in the hotel that employs his parents. Freddy is resistant to the idea: ""She wants to see good hearts and good brains put to proper use, but I'm not convinced that everybody ought to live like that, or even that everybody can.""

Oyeyemi seems to be incapable of writing anything that's not wholly original. ""Is Your Blood As Red As This?"" follows the lives of students at a bizarre puppetry school; one character is a ghost, and another, Rowan, is a ""wooden devil"" in genderless human form. ""No matter how soft his skin appears to be he is entirely wooden, and it is not known exactly what animates him  no clock ticks in his chest,"" Oyeyemi writes. ""His fellow students already had all those confusing hormone surges to deal with. So most of them stayed away, though I'm sure they all dreamed of him, her, hir, zir, a body with a tantalizing abundance of contours, this Rowan who is everything but mostly tree.""

It's one thing to write so beautifully about youth and desire; it's another thing entirely to do it in such a vividly imagined, unique setting. Oyeyemi manages to make the story both realistic and fantastical, and the characters are rendered with grace and compassion.

You could say the same thing for every story in What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours, from the subtle ""Presence"" to the chilling ""If a Book Is Locked There's Probably a Good Reason for That Don't You Think."" And even in the darkest moments of the book, Oyeyemi never loses her sense of humor  as one character notes, ""Sometimes I dream I'm falling, and it's not so much frightening as it is tedious, just falling and falling until I'm sick of it, but then a noose stops me short and I think, well, at least I'm not falling anymore.""

What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours is a lot of things: dreamy, spellbinding, and unlike just about anything you can imagine. It's a book that resists comparisons; Oyeyemi's talent is as unique as it is formidable. It's another masterpiece from an author who seems incapable of writing anything that's less than brilliant.",[]

i toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images

It appears that the attacks on presidential candidate Donald Trump's business record seem to have touched a nerve.

Despite three more primary and caucus victories on Tuesday, Trump eschewed a traditional victory speech, adding in a press conference  and something else: a table piled high with a veritable Trump-ucopia of Trump-branded products.

""I have very successful companies,"" the New York billionaire told reporters at the event at Trump National Golf Club Jupiter, in Jupiter, Fla., as raw steaks, bottles of wine and vodka, and magazines stood near the man himself.

In particular, Trump appeared irked about last week's speech by 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who declared, ""Whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there's Trump magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage. A business genius he is not.""

So what's the backstory of those products Trump pitched as a sign of his success?

Trump Steaks

Raw meat  of the real and rhetorical kinds  was front and center last night.

""Do we have steaks? We have Trump steaks,"" Trump boasted. ""If you want to take one, we'll charge you about, what, 50 bucks a steak?""

Trump did have an eponymous steak line, sold via Sharper Image. The company's website notes, however:

""Unfortunately, Trump Steaks are no longer available, but their legacy endures.""

A search for ""Trump"" on QVC's website finds various Melania Trump jewelry products, a line of Trump mattresses and one entry for Trump Steaks. But they're not actual steaks; they're ""Certified Angus Beef Steakburgers"" and QVC notes, ""We're sorry, this item is not available at this time.""

A reporter present at Trump's press conference notes that the steaks on the table were not actually a Trump brand, but appear, ironically, to have come from a company named ""Bush Brothers.""

Trump Magazine

""[Romney] said Trump Magazine is out. I said, it is? I thought I read one two days ago. This comes out, and it's called The Jewel of Palm Beach, and we  it goes to all of my clubs,"" said Trump, before throwing a copy out to the audience.

There is indeed a magazine called The Jewel of Palm Beach published by the Palm Beach Media Group that is described as ""the exclusive publication of Donald J. Trump's spectacular Mar-a-Lago Club"" and other Trump properties.

Trump does not appear to own the publisher, and the magazine only comes out on an annual basis.

There was a Trump magazine, which went out of circulation in 2009. The New York Daily News reported:

""The last iteration of the luxury lifestyle mag reached a circulation of 100,000 and sold for $5.95 before it flopped. Issues are nowhere to be found online and hardcopies are likely a rare collector's item.""

Trump Airline

""Well, I sold the airline, and I actually made a great deal, complicated and in really terrible times. The economy was horrible and I made a phenomenal deal,"" said Trump, referring to the Trump Shuttle.

NBC News recently looked back at the venture, and summarized Trump's ownership this way:

""Back in 1989, Trump pounced at the chance to buy the troubled Eastern Air Lines shuttle service for $365 million. He put the Trump name on the planes, dressed them up inside  and waited for business to boom. It didn't. But the business took on too much debt and eventually defaulted. It was sold to USAir.""

Trump University

Trump launched Trump University in 2005 to help budding real-estate entrepreneurs, but it ran afoul of regulators, who noted that it was not a degree-granting institution. Former students sued, claiming they were tricked into spending tens of thousands of dollars for seminars that didn't do anywhere near what was advertised.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is also suing and claiming that Trump and his associates defrauded students of a collective $40 million. The now-renamed Trump Entrepreneur Initiative is mostly dormant.

Trump is challenging those lawsuits and says he will win and that, when that happens, he will reopen Trump U: ""It's going to do very well,"" Trump said, ""and it will continue to do very well.""

Trump Winery

The table was stacked with bottles of Trump Wine, and Trump declared of the winery, ""I own it 100 percent, no mortgage, no debt.""

The winery's website says something different: ""Trump Winery is a registered trade name of Eric Trump Wine Manufacturing LLC, which is not owned, managed or affiliated with Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization or any of their affiliates.""

Trump, who is a teetotaler, also used to sell Trump Vodka, although that venture has also been discontinued. A review described the vodka's taste this way:

""Vodka from The Donald. Nosings reveal dry, earthy scents of grain, paraffin, kid leather, jasmine, flowers, moss and soot. Palate entry displays far better than average grain focus and viscosity; at midpalate, the taste profile turns off-dry, intensely breakfast cereal-like and biscuity. Finishes oily/creamy and snack cracker-like.""

Trump Water

There were also pallets of Trump Water on stage. On Trump's website, the water is touted as ""one of the purest natural spring waters bottled in the world.""

""I mean, we sell water, and we have water, and it's a very successful,"" Trump said, ""you know, it's a private little water company, and I supply the water for all my places, and it's good.""

So does Trump own the natural springs or bottle the water himself? According to reporters at the event who looked the label, probably not.

As Trump himself put it Tuesday night, ""So you have the water; you have the steaks; you have the airline that I sold. I mean, what's wrong with selling? Every once in a while you can sell something. You have the wines and all of that, and Trump University, we're going to start it up as soon as I win the lawsuit. Does that make sense? I mean, that's it. OK.""",[]
npr.org,2016-03-05 00:00:00,"'Rodeo' Gets In Touch With The Wild, Both Inside And Out",[],"'Rodeo' Gets In Touch With The Wild, Both Inside And Out

What would the United States be without its immigrants? Imagine no pizza, no New York City Ballet, no Saul Bellow  and no new waves of talented emigre authors helping us to see American culture from fresh angles. With his first novel, A Replacement Life, Boris Fishman (who came to the United States from Belarus in 1988 when he was nine) staked himself a spot in the impressive lineup of immigrant writers born in the former Soviet Union. He shares a satirical edginess with Gary Shteyngart, but his tragi-comic worldview and inverted sentence cadences evoke Bernard Malamud as he zeroes in on the rub between his characters' native and adoptive lands and the theme of reinvention.

Fishman's second novel, Don't Let My Baby Do Rodeo, comes harnessed with what is surely one of the oddest titles of the year. Could it refer to an assimilating immigrant's resolve to draw the line at an American pastime that outdoes even football in its violence? Fishman quickly bucks that idea. His story focuses on a Jewish couple  originally from Belarus and Ukraine  who adopt a blonde, ""unquestionable goy"" baby from Montana. ""Please don't let my baby do rodeo"" is the biological mother's sole, parting request. Huh? Well, her young husband's addiction to rodeo has destroyed both his body and their prospects.

Fishman rides the theme of adoption hard as a metaphor for cultural transplantation. Baby Max is repotted in New Jersey with Maya and Alex Rubin and Alex's overbearing parents. Maya, torn from her mother and her native culture in Kiev, can identify; she feels smothered by her life with the Rubins, who she refers to not as in-laws but as her adopted family.

Related NPR Stories

The novel jumps around in both time and tone. Set mostly in 2012, it reels back to 2004, when the couple adopt Max, and 1992, when Maya Shulman meets Alex Rubin just as her student visa is about to run out. Alex, a coddled only child who came to America at eight, is smitten by Maya's bold capriciousness: ""This is what happens when Maya comes around  her presence kneads the unease inside him until it shapes into insight.""

Unfortunately, as Fishman's focus shifts almost entirely onto restless, flighty Maya, Alex becomes a distant cipher, a void not just in Maya's life but the book. ""How will Maya know whether she said yes to the man or the country?"" her mother astutely wonders at her wedding. Twenty years later, the question eats at Maya more and more.

Max turns out to be a quiet, easy child, causing little worry  until, at eight, he begins to display a growing communion with nature, which the Rubins find bewilderingly alien. Their prejudices against wildlife run almost as deep as their prejudices against adoption, leading them to wonder whether Max's so-called ""acting out"" and ""wildness"" are written into his DNA. ""Genes are not water,"" Alex's father reminds them. ""Biologically, he is and always will be the child of those people.""

Fishman's novel veers from gently, quasi-comical to broad-stroke satirical to earnestly heartfelt. Along the way, there are plenty of sharp observations about American culture, parenting, and the adoption process. ""A unicorn comes online more often than Jewish,"" says their adoption counselor  who shares the name Mishkin with Dostoyevsky's saintly idiot.

It takes nearly two hundred pages for the Rubins to head west in search of Max's roots  by which point readers may be as restless as Maya. Once they hit the road in their aptly named Escape, the novel gains momentum. Maya confronts her alienation, homesickness, and frustrated yearning and behaves badly in the Badlands. The plains may be flat and barren, but Fishman's narrative swerves repeatedly in refreshingly unexpected directions. After a bumpy start, Don't Let My Baby Do Rodeo grows on you as it stretches beyond themes of adaptation to champion the importance of getting in touch with the great wilderness  both in nature and oneself.",[]

i Katherine Du/NPR Katherine Du/NPR

Miss Manners and skilled prep cooks should be pleased: Our early human ancestors likely mastered the art of chopping and slicing more than 2 million years ago. Not only did this yield daintier pieces of meat and vegetables that were much easier to digest raw, with less chewing  it also helped us along the road to becoming modern humans, researchers reported Wednesday.

And our ancestors picked up these skills at least 1.5 million years before cooking took off as a common way to prepare food, the researchers say.

Chewing, it turns out, takes a lot of time and energy, say Katherine Zink and Daniel Lieberman, evolutionary biologists at Harvard University. They recently set about measuring precisely how much effort is required to chew raw food, and to what degree simple stone tools might have eased the toil.

""Every time I go out to dinner, I watch people chew,"" Lieberman tells us. ""And sometimes, I actually count how many times they chew.""

It's not just a hobby. Lieberman's interest gets to some basic questions of how humans evolved.

Scientists have long known that Homo erectus, an ancestor of modern humans who lived about 2 million years ago, had already evolved to have a bigger body and brain than earlier hominins, and would have needed much more daily energy to survive. But the jaw and teeth of H. erectus were much like ours today  significantly smaller and less powerful than those of Australopithecus afarensis, or other hominins of earlier epochs.

A diet that included cooked meat would have provided that ready energy without the need for sharp canines and big grinders. But the research evidence is pretty clear that cooking didn't become common until about 500,000 years ago, Lieberman says. So, how did H. erectus get the needed calories?

To test a long-held hypothesis that simple food processing might be the answer, Zink and Lieberman invited some Harvard colleagues to what Zink calls ""a lab cafe,"" and served them small portions of carrots, beets, jewel yams and goat meat. The food was served variously as roasted or raw; sliced, pounded or left in hunks.

""If I were to give you raw goat,"" Lieberman says, ""you'd chew, and nothing would happen."" Like a lot of wild game, goat meat tends to be stringy, he says. Chewing a big piece makes it more elastic, but it doesn't readily break into pieces.

""But if you cut goat into smaller pieces,"" he says, ""your ability to chew it would improved dramatically.""

All the volunteers (14 for the vegetables and just 10 for the goat meat) wore a number of small sensors pasted to their faces, to detect and count contractions of various muscle fibers as they chewed the bite of food to the point of swallowing. The scientists then translated those contractions into a measure of muscular effort, and also checked to see how well the food was broken up.

Their results, published in the journal Nature, suggest that when eating a diet made up of one-third meat, if early humans pounded the vegetables before eating them, and sliced the meat, they would need to chew 17 percent less often and 26 percent less forcefully than if they started with larger slabs of the food. Every little flex of the jaw and grinding of the teeth adds up: Over the course of a year, Lieberman says, simply having a sharp stone to slice meat would reduce the number of ""chews"" needed by 2.5 million.

""I think it's amazing,"" he says, ""to think that the simple stone tool could have a massive effect on how effectively we chew a piece of meat.""

It's possible, he and Zink think, that the benefits of meat-eating and food processing favored the transition to smaller teeth and jaws.

But it seems more likely, they write in their study, that tool use and meat-eating simply reduced the evolutionary pressure to have big, powerful jaws and sharp teeth, ""thus permitting selection to decrease facial and dental size for other functions, such as speech production, locomotion, thermoregulation, or, perhaps even changes in the size and shape of the brain.""

Pat Conroy, the beloved author of The Great Santini, The Lords of Discipline and The Prince of Tides, has died. Conroy  who announced last month that he had pancreatic cancer  died Friday night at his home among his family in Beaufort, S.C. He was 70 years old.

Pat Conroy was a master storyteller, blending the raw material of his difficult family life with the landscape of coastal South Carolina. In 1986, Conroy told me that the reason he wrote was to explain his own life to himself.

""Writing has been not therapeutic for me, but it has been essential,"" he said in an interview for Morning Edition. ""I have written about my mother, my father, my family ... and if I get it on paper, I have named the demon.""

Conroy's best known work is The Prince of Tides, a novel about a troubled South Carolina native recounting his story to a New York psychiatrist.

The prologue begins: ""My wound is geography.""

I was born and raised on a Carolina sea island and I carried the sunshine of the low country, inked in dark gold, on my back and shoulders. As a boy I was happy above the channels, navigating a small boat between the sandbars with their quiet nation of oysters exposed on the brown flats at the low watermark.

Nan Talese was Pat Conroy's editor for the past 35 years, beginning with The Prince of Tides  a span that saw Conroy's book sales rise to a total of 20 million copies worldwide.

She recalled the first thing he said to her when they met. ""He said, 'I will tell you, if there are ten words for something, I will use all ten. Your job is to take them out.'""

Talese said Conroy touched people with his language and his honesty.

""His incredible sense of empathy with people. ... I think that his books influenced a lot of people because he was so open and honest. And it really struck their hearts.""

Pat Conroy was born in 1945 in Atlanta. He was a self-described ""military brat."" His family moved every year until they settled in Beaufort when he was 12.

YouTube

In his 1976 book The Great Santini, Conroy wrote about his relationship with his abusive father, a Marine aviator. In the 1979 film version of the story, the father is played by Robert Duvall. In one scene, he addresses his four young children after a move, as if they are soldiers under his command.

After high school, Pat Conroy's father sent his oldest son to The Citadel, Charleston's storied military academy, where Pat began to write fiction. Conroy said his natural storytelling ability was never affected by literary theory.

""I missed all the classes in the art of fiction,"" Conroy said in 1986. ""We didn't have any. I'm great on military science. But I missed all the classes on 'Is this a great technique for fiction?' I never learned any of that stuff.""

His education as a writer came elsewhere.

""I came from a family of great storytellers,"" he said. ""That is something about the South I think has been preserved. The yarn, the story, and the ability to tell one well, is a beloved trait in several of my uncles and aunts. And a great story changes the world for you  changes the way you look at life.""

Pat Conroy said he looked for stories that told something about the world that he didn't know before.

And he said he faced challenges along the way. ""The one thing I've had is a very painful life filled with utter moments of great joy. Things happen to me for reasons I cannot figure out. And things have continued to happen to me all my life, and happen to my family all my life, and now happen to my friends. ... What I hope is that I don't die before I can tell all the stories I still haven't told.""

Conroy was telling those stories until the end. Before he died he finished a short novel called Aquarius, set in the Vietnam era, and dedicated to his ""friends who become teachers.""",[]

When she was 17, Tracey Helton Mitchell was prescribed an opioid pain killer after getting her wisdom teeth extracted. The medicine helped her deal with the pain related to the extraction, but when the prescription ran out, her desire for its euphoric high remained. That's when she turned to heroin.

As a teenager, Mitchell imagined heroin to be glamorous, but she found it wasn't once she became an addict. She tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that the drug ruined her health and her self-esteem. She lived in an alley, shot drugs into the bottom of her feet, sold her body for money and was jailed several times. She was also featured in a 1999 documentary about addicts called Black Tar Heroin.

At one of her lowest points, Mitchell says, ""I was having heart palpitations, because I was using stimulants, and I thought, 'They're going to pull me out of this hotel, I have no ID, my parents, my family ... will never know that I died and I'll just be a Jane Doe and this is how I'm going to expire in this place.' ""

But Mitchell didn't die from her addiction. Rather, with the help of the nondenominational 12-step program LifeRing and other support groups and therapies, she eventually stopped using and became a certified addiction specialist. She has been clean for 18 years.

In her new memoir, The Big Fix, Mitchell writes about her addiction and her path to recovery, and also shares insights into today's heroin epidemic. When it comes to our current treatment system, Mitchell says we would do better to reach out to addicts as individuals, by recognizing each user's unique needs and motivations.

Our current method of treatment is ""sort of a one-size-[fits]-all approach,"" she says. ""We need to have a variety of different kinds of treatment interventions that address people's needs.""

Interview Highlights

On what it's like to watch Black Tar Heroin now that she's clean

It can be painful to watch, especially when I think about my life now and I contrast that. ... My legs did look like I was dropped in a dumpster and picked out by rats. I had, I think, 34 or 36 abscesses. I have scars that have healed, but I had to have surgeries on some and in the summertime when everybody else is wearing shorts and stuff like that, I see those things  even right now sitting here at the table I can see one of the scars on my arms. It's a good thing in that it reminds me of where I was, but then it's also very challenging, because this documents a very unpleasant part of my life that can't be changed.

On why she agreed to be filmed

I really believed that I was going to die, or be murdered. There was lots of evidence to make me feel that way, and I wanted it to be something that people would see after I was dead that showed that heroin was not the glamorous thing that I had thought it was when I was a teenager and had imagined it. I wasn't paid for the film; it was a huge inconvenience in my life, but I feel like it still is sort of my legacy to the world, because it's something that's watched today. Millions of people still watch it.

On black tar heroin in the '90s versus heroin today

There's still tar heroin. The heroin that most people get today is much, much stronger. We didn't have to worry about fentanyl  of us dropping dead from an overdose, because no one cut it with fentanyl. The thing that we really worried about was getting flesh-eating [bacteria, necrotizing fasciitis] ... or getting some kind of wound botulism or getting abscesses. There certainly were overdoses then. You could get arrested for overdosing and a lot of people were rolled out at the hospitals or left outside to die ... but there wasn't this culture of heroin where heroin is prevalent absolutely everywhere. It was more localized to big cities, more urban areas.

On 'hitting bottom'

i toggle caption Michael Kerner Photography/Seal Press Michael Kerner Photography/Seal Press

I don't believe in the concept of a bottom. I think that if the opposite of addiction is connection, that addicts or people who use drugs are really seeking out  they need some kind of connection with people. And I would say I've had a wide variety of bottoms, but I wasn't ready to stop until I started to believe that there was a possibility that I actually could stop and saw reasons for myself to stop, and my motivation is totally different.

On being ready to get clean

One of the myths about addiction is that you come to this incredible moment of clarity and that you decide that you're going to stop. And so over the course of my using I had various moments of clarity and I had various points where I had wanted to stop, but they were not always congruent with my opportunities.

So there [were] very few opportunities where I really could truly try to stop, but I would stop using for a few days, I'd try to kick on my own, I'd switch to different drugs, I'd move to different places. I tried different things to stop, but I wasn't completely ready, because all these different traumas had accumulated in my life, and I wasn't prepared to deal with the emotional consequences of all these different things. And that's what to me being off drugs meant  was that I would have to then figure out how I was going to fix all these things on my own. And it wasn't until I got an idea that maybe other people would help me, talking to my mother, knowing that I would have some kind of emotional support where I'd start seeing [that] maybe I don't have to totally do all of this on my own.

On needle exchange programs

At the time there was no needle exchange at all [in Cincinnati] and so you would use the same syringe over and over again and hopefully it didn't break off in your arm. Until the numbers wore off of it, you would sharpen it on a matchbook, and it was just horrible; it was like a rusty nail sticking in your arm.

So I came to San Francisco and they had needle exchanges, which was a revelation, because so many people in the country were suffering from HIV and AIDS, particularly AIDS, because there was no anti-retrovirals. ... So the syringe exchange people provided me education about my drug use. ...

I've seen in my life so many examples of where not having a clean syringe never stopped anyone. I've seen people pick them up out of the gutters. Even here in San Francisco, where there's a lot of access, people break open sharps containers that they've stolen from hospitals because they needed a syringe and they don't have one. ... It doesn't stop people. All it does is spread a public health crisis.

On harm reduction and the argument that harm reduction enables users

My answer is, you can't get clean if you're dead, so there has to be harm reduction. We're not encouraging people to do anything, we're taking a look at their public health behaviors and then addressing what the particular needs are, so look at the cost of one syringe versus the cost of someone getting hepatitis C and having to take care of them for a lifetime.

Look at the public health cost of various other medical conditions that a person can have. From not using sterile water or alcohol pads, someone having endocarditis or some other infection, so having a safe system for people to take care of themselves and treating addicts, users not just addicts, there's plenty of people who use who are not necessarily considered on the spectrum of drug addicts, treating people humanely and having them have access to public health services and the things that they need.

On coping with depression since becoming clean

Part of the reason why I wanted to write The Big Fix is because I felt like there's no ... real education on long-term recovery about what really happens over time. So dealing with topics like untreated depression and anxiety and all the other kind of things that you go through when you take the drugs away, and then you have new issues, because before you use drugs, you didn't have all these guilty, shameful things that you ... now have to deal with, if you're a person like me and you get off drugs.

So I've had a very complicated relationship with my emotions in the past 18 years that I've been clean. I've dealt with very serious post-traumatic stress disorder, being very checked out and dissociative at various points, having to deal with the constant specter of depression, every once in a while having suicidal thoughts. And one of the things that I try to do is really normalize those feelings when people want to know what recovery is really like. It's like, some days you really feel crappy. You really have some things that are going on with you, and I think the prevalent idea is that you get clean and everything is supposed to be great. ... You can have a great life and still not feel all that great.",[]

It appears that the attacks on presidential candidate Donald Trump's business record seem to have touched a nerve.

Despite three more primary and caucus victories on Tuesday, Trump eschewed a traditional victory speech, adding in a press conference  and something else: a table piled high with a veritable Trump-ucopia of Trump-branded products.

""I have very successful companies,"" the New York billionaire told reporters at the event at Trump National Golf Club Jupiter, in Jupiter, Fla., as raw steaks, bottles of wine and vodka, and magazines stood near the man himself.

In particular, Trump appeared irked about last week's speech by 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney, who declared, ""Whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there's Trump magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage. A business genius he is not.""

So what's the backstory of those products Trump pitched as a sign of his success?

Trump Steaks

Raw meat  of the real and rhetorical kinds  was front and center last night.

""Do we have steaks? We have Trump steaks,"" Trump boasted. ""If you want to take one, we'll charge you about, what, 50 bucks a steak?""

Trump did have an eponymous steak line, sold via Sharper Image. The company's website notes, however:

""Unfortunately, Trump Steaks are no longer available, but their legacy endures.""

A search for ""Trump"" on QVC's website finds various Melania Trump jewelry products, a line of Trump mattresses and one entry for Trump Steaks. But they're not actual steaks; they're ""Certified Angus Beef Steakburgers"" and QVC notes, ""We're sorry, this item is not available at this time.""

A reporter present at Trump's press conference notes that the steaks on the table were not actually a Trump brand, but appear, ironically, to have come from a company named ""Bush Brothers.""

Trump Magazine

""[Romney] said Trump Magazine is out. I said, it is? I thought I read one two days ago. This comes out, and it's called The Jewel of Palm Beach, and we  it goes to all of my clubs,"" said Trump, before throwing a copy out to the audience.

There is indeed a magazine called The Jewel of Palm Beach published by the Palm Beach Media Group that is described as ""the exclusive publication of Donald J. Trump's spectacular Mar-a-Lago Club"" and other Trump properties.

Trump does not appear to own the publisher, and the magazine only comes out on an annual basis.

There was a Trump magazine, which went out of circulation in 2009. The New York Daily News reported:

""The last iteration of the luxury lifestyle mag reached a circulation of 100,000 and sold for $5.95 before it flopped. Issues are nowhere to be found online and hardcopies are likely a rare collector's item.""

Trump Airline

""Well, I sold the airline, and I actually made a great deal, complicated and in really terrible times. The economy was horrible and I made a phenomenal deal,"" said Trump, referring to the Trump Shuttle.

NBC News recently looked back at the venture, and summarized Trump's ownership this way:

""Back in 1989, Trump pounced at the chance to buy the troubled Eastern Air Lines shuttle service for $365 million. He put the Trump name on the planes, dressed them up inside  and waited for business to boom. It didn't. But the business took on too much debt and eventually defaulted. It was sold to USAir.""

Trump University

Trump launched Trump University in 2005 to help budding real-estate entrepreneurs, but it ran afoul of regulators, who noted that it was not a degree-granting institution. Former students sued, claiming they were tricked into spending tens of thousands of dollars for seminars that didn't do anywhere near what was advertised.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is also suing and claiming that Trump and his associates defrauded students of a collective $40 million. The now-renamed Trump Entrepreneur Initiative is mostly dormant.

Trump is challenging those lawsuits and says he will win and that, when that happens, he will reopen Trump U: ""It's going to do very well,"" Trump said, ""and it will continue to do very well.""

Trump Winery

The table was stacked with bottles of Trump Wine, and Trump declared of the winery, ""I own it 100 percent, no mortgage, no debt.""

The winery's website says something different: ""Trump Winery is a registered trade name of Eric Trump Wine Manufacturing LLC, which is not owned, managed or affiliated with Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization or any of their affiliates.""

Trump, who is a teetotaler, also used to sell Trump Vodka, although that venture has also been discontinued. A review described the vodka's taste this way:

""Vodka from The Donald. Nosings reveal dry, earthy scents of grain, paraffin, kid leather, jasmine, flowers, moss and soot. Palate entry displays far better than average grain focus and viscosity; at midpalate, the taste profile turns off-dry, intensely breakfast cereal-like and biscuity. Finishes oily/creamy and snack cracker-like.""

Trump Water

There were also pallets of Trump Water on stage. On Trump's website, the water is touted as ""one of the purest natural spring waters bottled in the world.""

""I mean, we sell water, and we have water, and it's a very successful,"" Trump said, ""you know, it's a private little water company, and I supply the water for all my places, and it's good.""

So does Trump own the natural springs or bottle the water himself? According to reporters at the event who looked the label, probably not.

As Trump himself put it Tuesday night, ""So you have the water; you have the steaks; you have the airline that I sold. I mean, what's wrong with selling? Every once in a while you can sell something. You have the wines and all of that, and Trump University, we're going to start it up as soon as I win the lawsuit. Does that make sense? I mean, that's it. OK.""",[]

 Police say it didnt happen.

In situations such as this, we should first ask whether we should repeat the claim. After all, repeating it might give it more life. But if the answer to that question is yes, we should get to the point and say what weve found. Heres how The Two-Way has done it:

We asked our library to look through contemporaneous news reports. They tell us that that they could not turn up any news accounts of American Muslims cheering or celebrating in the wake of Sept. 11.

Another way to say that might be: NPR has searched for credible news accounts about large groups of American Muslims celebrating during or after the Sept. 11 attacks. No such accounts have been found.

We could also flatly report that no evidence has been found in police or credible media accounts from the time to indicate there were large numbers of Muslim-Americans in New Jersey celebrating. We have used the no evidence framing on the air.

Regarding The Washington Post report from Sept. 18, 2001, that Trump has cited, it stated that in Jersey City, within hours of two jetliners plowing into the World Trade Center, law enforcement authorities detained and questioned a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding tailgate-style parties on rooftops while they watched the devastation on the other side of the river. But as we said on Morning Edition this week, there is no reference in the [Washington Post] article to Trumps claim of seeing thousands and thousands Muslims celebrating in Jersey City.

FactCheck.org has noted that:

The Post story said that Jersey City police detained a number of people who were allegedly seen celebrating the attacks and holding a tailgate-style party in Jersey City. That allegation was unattributed and unverified. Even if it did happen, and there is no evidence of it, the celebrating was not on TV and did not involve thousands and thousands of people.

Before Black Lives Matter was a hashtag, before it was a slogan chanted by protesters in cities across the country, before it was a national movement, it was a Facebook post by an Oakland-based activist named Alicia Garza. She wrote it after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the shooting death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. It read in part: ""I continue to be surprised at how little black lives matter, and I will continue that. Stop giving up on black life."" She ended by saying, ""Black people, I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.""

NPR's Kelly McEvers spoke with Jelani Cobb, who recently wrote an article in the New Yorker about Black Lives Matter, how the movement started and where it stands today. He talks about how those three words were later adopted as a rallying cry by protesters from around the country who came to Ferguson, Mo. after 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer.

Interview Highlights

On tensions about who speaks for the movement

""I think there's been a conflict that's played itself out publicly in terms of the people who founded the idea or came up with the name and the people who really did the pivotal work on the ground in Ferguson. In some ways, it's an entity that has two births. It's conceived after one tragedy and really comes to fruition after another. And we've talked about the Internet and social media and the ways that those things have really revolutionized and changed the way social activism happens. In some ways that's a plus, but it can be a really big liability as well because a good bit of the conflict between the various factions of Black Lives Matter has played itself out in public and on social media...

""A little more recently, Alicia Garza was going to come to St. Louis to give a speech at Webster University, and a great deal of social media chatter erupted about this and whether or not she had any place coming there, and whether it was more appropriate to think of the people who were in St. Louis and Ferguson as the founders. When I spoke to Alicia Garza about it, she said that she got death threats and threats of violence, and she wound up canceling the talk. That became kind of a crucial moment in the history of this organization where a person who is organizing about African-Americans and their lives is really not giving a talk because of threats to her own.""

On how earlier ideas of leadership don't necessarily work for this movement

""We associate whole blocks of history with W.E.B. Du Bois or Booker T. Washington or Malcolm X or Dr. King. Entire constellations of history are distilled down to two individuals, almost always male. There's been a certain kind of fatigue, and Black Lives Matter represents that. They find a more horizontal ethic of leadership to be more important, and they find inspiration from Ella Baker, who was one of the most central figures of the civil rights movement in - partly due to her belief in kind of grassroots and local leadership in her aversion to the spotlight. Her story wasn't as well known. And so they have kind of resurrected her idea that it's better to have 10,000 candles than a single spotlight.""

On who Black Lives Matter represents

""Movements tend to pick up where the last one left off. When people look back at the civil rights movement, one of the most glaring shortcomings that emerges is in many ways the marginalization of women within the movement or things like Bayard Rustin, who was the pivotal organizer of the March on Washington, but also faced discrimination as a gay black man. Those are the things that Black Lives Matter look at and say, we want to not replicate those things. We want to not replicate the errors of the past.""

On the effects of having a diffuse organization

""When I talked with Alicia Garza, she was very clear about making a distinction between Black Lives Matter the organization and Black Lives Matter as a movement. But it's been almost kind of like a franchising effect. The fact that there's a low barrier to entry has been useful when there are people who have never participated in a political protest before and they're willing to come out and say, 'OK, I can be part of this Black Lives Matter thing, and I agree with, you know, what's happening here.' At the same time, it makes it a little bit more difficult to have a kind of discipline within the ranks. And then you have a third element, which is the tendency of people to refer to any statement by a disgruntled black person as...connected to Black Lives Matter.""

On where Black Lives Matter could go from here

""I don't think it's easy to predict these things. But one of the things that I think we ought to take note of is the circumstances that allow Black Lives Matter to flourish. One is the existence of a black presidency and these sorts of egregious racial problems continuing in the context of a black presidency, which contributed to a climate of frustration. And we're in the last year of the Obama presidency, and so that will change. In addition to that, precisely because we're in an election year, we've seen the movement to be able to leverage influence and - helping to shape and push the direction in which these two candidates on the Democratic side, at least, are moving. I don't think that necessarily will happen after the presidential election. Or at least it's not as easily achieved.""

On the distance between the political process and everyday realities

""It's not necessarily that the black president is not doing more, because I don't think it all lays at President Obama's feet. I think it's the frustration of having both of these circumstances coexist, that you can be represented at the most powerful level of electoral politics and you can have incidents like the death of Trayvon Martin and the subsequent acquittal of George Zimmerman. Those two things are fully capable of coexisting.""

npr.org,,"When Were Asked To Remove A Photo, Heres What We Do",[],"When Were Asked To Remove A Photo, Heres What We Do

Occasionally, someone in a photo we have posted asks that we remove the image from our website.

Any such request must be redirected to:

 Kainaz Amaria or another editor from the Visuals team.

 Chuck and/or Gerry Holmes, the deputy managing editors.

In most cases, the correspondent producer or staff photographer who took the image will already be aware of the request, as will the editor who handed the report. If not, they will be drawn into the discussion by Kainaz, Chuck and/or Gerry.

Others who will be brought in:

 Digital ME Scott Montgomery.

 Standards & Practices editor Mark Memmott.

The executive editor, VP for News and SVP for News will be looped in too.

The issue of whether to remove an image is a serious matter. As weve said before when discussing requests to take down stories, we agree with the AP that:

We are guided by a newsroom policy that says it is inappropriate to remove content from our Website. If a report is inaccurate, we will correct it and state why it has been altered. If relevant new information emerges, we will update or do a follow-up story. But our content is a matter of public record and is part of our contract with our audience. To simply remove it from the archive diminishes transparency and trust and, in effect, erases history. This is not a practice engaged in by credible news organizations or in line with ethical journalism.

A key question that will be asked when such requests come in: What was the person told about how the photo or photos would be used?

It is important that people know were not doing stories that only go on the air. We spend time making sure they understand that the stories live on our website and that the photos we take will be there as well. And as weve said before:

Kainaz Amaria from NPRs visuals team says she has found that the more transparent I am about my intentions with people in my story, the more they are willing to share their time and moments. It may sound counterintuitive, but in fact its been proven to me every time I step out of the office and into someones life. If people trust you, trust you are there to listen and learn, youll be surprised at the access they will offer you. ... If people say, Wait you are radio, why do you want my picture? I usually say something like, Well, many of our stories go online to reach a wider audience and to get more eyeballs. Chances are if they see you, then they will connect with your story. 

Kainaz and the Visuals team have considerable experience dealing with this issue. If a request comes in, they should take the lead. In most cases, it should be someone from Visuals who gets back to the person who wants a photo removed.

ROSENTHAL: OK.

BILL KURTIS: A war against calmness I wage. This pose is called rat in a cage. I scream and I swear as the metal jams blare. My yoga is fueled by...

ROSENTHAL: My rage?

SAGAL: Yes, rage.

KURTIS: Rage, doctor.

ROSENTHAL: Yes.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: So it turns out Calgary, Canada, is apparently on the cutting edge of the yoga scene. A couple weeks ago, we told you about a studio in Calgary offering couple's nude yoga. This week, we learned about a Calgary yoga instructor that is - who is offering rage yoga. It's just a coincidence. It's easy to imagine how a nude couples yoga could lead to directly to rage yoga. But rage yoga, as advertised in Calgary - it's just regular yoga but with more swearing, loud music and beer. And instead of a yoga studio, rage yoga is down in the basement of a pub. So really it's a lot less like yoga and more like having a woman yell at you what while you try to bend yourself out of the way.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: I just - I mean, I've been doing yoga and it's very nice. I just can't imagine doing it while somebody's yelling at me.

ADAM BURKE: I can't imagine it any other way.

SAGAL: OK.

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: Can you - can you imagine doing it nude? Because that seems...

SAGAL: No, no...

ROBERTS: Yeah, I see that...

SAGAL: We discussed this at some length. There's no way ever, no.

GOLDTHWAIT: Wait, imagine myself or other people?

SAGAL: Anybody.

ROBERTS: Anybody.

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: Stop it. Open your eyes.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, here is your next limerick, Lila.

ROSENTHAL: OK, ready.

KURTIS: When I'm tired, my teeth crave more crunchies. I'm full but I'll snack on this fun cheese. It's sleep that I need, but I act high on weed. Fatigue is the cause of my...

ROSENTHAL: Muchies.

SAGAL: Yes.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

KURTIS: It is.

ROSENTHAL: Come on, I'm in Boulder, for heaven's sake.

SAGAL: You are.

(LAUGHTER)

KURTIS: You ought to know.

SAGAL: You don't have to be stoned though to get the munchies. You just have to be tired. Researchers at the University of Chicago - go Chicago - found out that when...

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Yes, when you're sleep-deprived, your brain releases chemicals, endocannabinoids, that act very similar to those of marijuana. And this is why when you're sort of tired and staggering around the kitchen you eat so much. You're not baked; you're just high on life. And now that we know our brains can produce the same chemicals as pot, think about how much money we'll save. Your drug dealer is your own brain, although weirdly, you still don't want to talk to it more than you have to.

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: How much did this research cost to unlock the old food-energy paradigm?

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: Turns out when you're tired, you might need to eat something.

GOLDTHWAIT: You might get a little...

SAGAL: Well, no, no, the idea is - you know, the munchies are just sort of a kind of a hunger - I want to eat something even though you're not necessarily hungry with the munchies.

GOLDTHWAIT: I think that's true. Like, I've had a lot of insomnia, and I do get ravenous. And I think I'm going to eat and then it's going to put me to sleep.

SAGAL: No, it never works.

ROBERTS: So what do you much on?

GOLDTHWAIT: Just everything - well, I don't eat much, you know? I mean, I don't get this body by abusing it.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, here, Lila, is your last limerick.

ROSENTHAL: OK.

KURTIS: Though Kanye might think himself regal, his actions are weird but still legal. He would keep drones at bay with some grand birds of prey. As guards, he'll trade dogs for an...

ROSENTHAL: Seagull.

(LAUGHTER)

ROSENTHAL: Sagal.

BURKE: The confidence.

KURTIS: Good for you.

(APPLAUSE)

GOLDTHWAIT: Do you know - do you know how - do you know how close...

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: Do you know how close the American bald seagull was our...

SAGAL: Yeah, no.

GOLDTHWAIT: ...National bird?

ROSENTHAL: Oh, man. It's eagle?

SAGAL: It is eagle, yeah.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Although I was excited because of course, the American bald seagull is my second cousin.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Say what you - it's eagle - say what you will about rapper Kanye West - he's narcissistic, he's thin-skinned, he's the biggest [expletive] in the Kardashian family.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: But he's a brilliant innovator in all things. And so when Kanye has been thinking about protecting his family, especially from paparazzi, he went right to mercenary-trained in eagles. Kanye West is reportedly trying to hire these eagles that Danish police have trained to attack drones. He's tired of these paparazzi drones sent to take pictures of himself and his family. But he can't help himself. Eagle tries to do its job, eagle's attacking the drone, Kanye would drop in and say I'm going to let you finish but a falcon is the best raptor of all time.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Bill, how did Lila do on our quiz?

KURTIS: Well, Lila was a winter before she tried to change the national bird. But congratulations anyway, Lila from Boulder.

SAGAL: Thank you so much, Lila.

ROSENTHAL: Thank you.

SAGAL: Bye-bye.

As Canada's new leader, Justin Trudeau should by rights be moving into the official prime minister's residence in Ottawa. It was a place where he spent much of his childhood, when his father, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, led the nation. But after years of neglect, the 34-room riverfront mansion is in such bad repair that Trudeau and his family have to live elsewhere.

Complaints about the residence at 24 Sussex Drive are legendary. Margaret Trudeau, the new prime minister's mother, famously called the residence ""the crown jewel of the federal penitentiary system."" The wife of a former Canadian prime minister placed buckets in the living room to catch rain leaking through the roof. Another complained it was freezing in the winter.

From a distance, the 138-year-old limestone structure looks distinguished and befitting a Canadian leader. But it shows its age when you get up close.

Diane Beckett, the interim director of the Sierra Club of Canada, visited 24 Sussex Drive a few years ago and describes it as ""quite worn down and quite faded."" The kitchen was minuscule, she says, and the place was drafty.

""They put in this 1960s cheap patio door that you would have in your cottage. And so when I was there, they had actually covered it in plastic to keep the cold out,"" Beckett says.

In 2008, Canada's auditor general released a report saying decades of neglect had left just about everything in the residence in critical need of repairs: floors, ceilings, electrics, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, not to mention the asbestos that needs to be removed. The cost of those repairs was estimated at $10 million Canadian, or about $7.5 million U.S., and those estimates will likely double at the very least.

Historian and author Charlotte Gray says the residence has had no major repairs in more than 50 years because prime ministers don't want to spend the political capital.

""It's always absolutely red meat for the opposition,"" she says. ""This is the perfect opportunity to say your government is spending your dollars on luxury for their leader.""

Gray says some former leaders learned this the hard way. ""When Pierre Trudeau, the present prime minister's father, put in a swimming pool, that was seen as enormously self-indulgent,"" she says. ""And then when Prime Minister [Brian] Mulroney, he tried to upgrade it because he had a much swankier lifestyle  again, it was seen as he was putting on airs.""

Many other leaders simply chose to ignore the problems, Gray says.

Now that Trudeau has decided to move his family to another home, there is debate about what to do with the official residence. Many Canadians believe it's a heritage building that needs to be restored, and the hosts of two popular home renovation TV shows have offered their services.

Environmentalists like the Sierra Club's Beckett say the residence needs to be made energy efficient, in keeping with Trudeau's commitment to fighting climate change.

Greg Furlong, an energy specialist with Canada's EnviroCentre, says either way, great care needs to be taken with any sort of renovation on an old stone building.

""A lot of these older structures stay standing just because they were built in a certain era with certain conditions in mind,"" Furlong says. ""And sometimes if you change the conditions, then the structure will start to deteriorate.""

Maureen McTeer, the wife of former Prime Minister Joe Clark, says it's time to tear the place down. She told the CBC's Ontario Today program that it's not worth spending millions of dollars just to make 24 Sussex livable when there could be a new, modern prime minister's residence.

""I would very much like to see a house built which is worthy of all that is best in Canada, our best people putting it together, our best architects,"" she said.

A decision on the fate of the prime minister's residence isn't expected anytime soon.",[]
npr.org,,Guidance On Key Words That Come Up In The Planned Parenthood Stories,[],"Guidance On Key Words That Come Up In The Planned Parenthood Stories

Flatly saying or writing that Planned Parenthood officials have been secretly recorded discussing the sale of fetal tissue is akin to concluding that they committed a crime. That is a problem. We should not attach such judgments to people or institutions until the confessions or convictions are in.

Weve been on the story. Meanwhile, both FactCheck.org and PolitiFact have explored what is and isnt known at this point about what Planned Parenthood has done. FactCheck links to the 1993 law that defines what is and is not legal regarding the use of fetal tissue. Here are two key sections:

 PURCHASE OF TISSUE  It shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human fetal tissue for valuable consideration if the transfer affects interstate commerce.

 The term valuable consideration does not include reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.

The video makers and other Planned Parenthood critics say the organization was selling fetal tissue. Planned Parenthood says the tissue has been donated, not sold, and that only the organizations costs (reasonable payments) have been covered.

The facts are not all in.

For now, just as we would report that prosecutors say John Doe robbed the bank, we should attribute references to fetal tissue being sold. Theyre coming from Planned Parenthoods critics, for example. Conversely, at this point it is for Planned Parenthood to say  not us  that these were donations, not sales.

In the short space of a Newscast spot, an allegedly or accused of may be required when there isnt time to say more.

There are cases to be made for saying that Planned Parenthood officials were heard discussing how they could provide fetal tissue to researchers, or how those researchers could procure or obtain it. The issue of money being paid should be addressed in most reports. But, again, attribution is important when characterizing those payments.

A NASA mission to Mars that was originally scheduled to launch this month  then was canceled when a flaw was discovered in a pivotal piece of equipment  is back on the calendar. If all goes well, it will launch in 2018.

The InSight mission  or ""Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport"" mission  has been in the works since 2012. It will send a lander to the Red Planet to measure Mars' seismic activity and interior temperature, among other things.

Data on marsquakes and the planet's interior heat will help researchers better understand Mars' ""deep interior,"" NASA says. That, in turn, could help expand scientists' understanding of the formation of all rocky planets, including Earth.

The original launch was planned for March 2016. But in December, the mission had to be suspended because a flaw in the lander's French-built seismometer couldn't be fixed in time.

The instrument needs to work inside a vacuum ""to provide the exquisite sensitivity needed for measuring ground movements as small as half the radius of a hydrogen atom,"" NASA says  and the container needed to maintain that vacuum was leaking.

At the time, it wasn't clear if the mission would be postponed or called off altogether. But on Wednesday, NASA announced that it would resume work on the project.

No matter how quickly the vacuum issue is resolved, March 5, 2018, is the earliest the mission could launch. That window of opportunity depends on the alignment of the orbits of Earth and Mars.

The InSight mission is a part of NASA's Discovery Program, in which scientists compete for approval of relatively low-cost planetary missions. (The total cost of InSight was to be capped at $675 million, Science Magazine reported last December. At that time, NASA had already spent $525 million, and the space agency is currently assessing the cost added by the two-year delay.)

When InSight was picked, it beat out two other finalists  one that would have sent a probe to a comet to hop across its surface and study multiple locations, and another that would have sent a boat to Titan, one of the moons of Saturn, to travel across its hydrocarbon oceans.

NASA is currently in the process of selecting the next Discovery Program mission  or missions  from a set of five finalists, including projects studying Venus and a probe to land on a metallic asteroid.

NASA had originally suggested it might select two winners, instead of just one, this year. It's not yet clear if InSight's rescheduled launch will affect that decision or any other planned NASA missions.",[]

Sir George Martin, the music producer who signed the Beatles to a recording contract in 1962 and was their intimate collaborator as they together transformed popular music, died Tuesday at the age of 90.

Martin's death was confirmed by Adam Sharp, his manager in the U.K. In a statement, Sharp said:

Sir George Martin passed away peacefully at home yesterday evening, Tuesday March 8th. The family would like to thank everyone for their thoughts, prayers and messages of support.

Martin was often referred to as the ""Fifth Beatle."" He scoffed, but the band wouldn't have been the Beatles we know without him.

Martin's 1979 memoir (co-authored with Jeremy Hornsby) was titled All You Need Is Ears  but his ears, and his instincts as a music producer, were extraordinary.

A classically trained composer, George Martin began to work for the British record label EMI's imprint Parlophone Records in 1950, overseeing classical recordings as well as comedy records by the likes of Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Bernard Cribbins.

By 1962, when Cribbins' song ""Right Said Fred"" became a hit in the U.K., George Martin was running Parlophone Records and looking to sign up a rock 'n' roll band. The Beatles auditioned for him in June of 1962.

In a 2011 BBC interview, Martin said: ""They had this wonderful charisma. They made you feel good to be with them. And I thought their music was rubbish.""

Martin signed the Beatles anyway, and came to love their songs. For the rest of the 1960s, he was their closest collaborator, producing almost all of the band's music, playing piano with them, writing their orchestral arrangements and figuring out how to turn John Lennon and Paul McCartney's wilder ideas into records.

In 2011, Martin described how he'd produced one of Lennon's signature songs:

""There was one time on 'Rain' when I decided to play around with tapes, and I took John's voice off as a separate item and put it on a quarter-inch tape and turned it back to front and slid it around a bit and then put it in on the end of the song. And I played it to John when he came back and he said, 'That's gear! What is it?' And I said, 'It's you!' And I explained to him what I'd done. And from that moment he wanted everything backward.""

When he wasn't in the studio with the Beatles, George Martin produced records by British pop acts like Cilla Black, Gerry and the Pacemakers and Shirley Bassey.

In 1977, while visiting the West Indies, Martin fell in love with the island of Montserrat. He built a recording complex for his company AIR Studios there with the money he'd made producing post-Beatles hits like the band America's ""Sister Golden Hair.""

AIR Studios Montserrat was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and Martin gradually retired from recording as hearing loss robbed him of his golden ears. His final hit song was the best-selling single of all time: a year after being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, he produced Elton John's ""Candle in the Wind 1997.""

""As a whole, I've had a wonderful life,"" Martin told the BBC in 1995. ""I've met the most wonderful people, worked with the greatest of artists. I'm very fortunate. I've got no gripes at all.""",[]

Unless Sen. Marco Rubio doffs a fedora and flings it into flag-festooned circle of red, white and blue balloons as fireworks go off and a band plays the national anthem, there is no need today to say he tossed his hat into the ring.

In fact, how about if we try to make it through the next few weeks or months without saying anyone tossed their hat into anything? (Unless, that is, were reporting about boxing  where the phrase originated.)

If you havent read the news we posted Thursday, please do. Click on these headlines:

- Editors Note: Ethics Violations Identified In Several NPR Music And WQXR Reports

- Stories By A Contributing Writer Published On NPR.org That Contain Plagiarism

- NPR Acknowledges Plagiarism In 10 Music Stories

The ombudsman has also posted:

- Plagiarism Found In 10 NPR Music Stories

Before describing how this situation was handled, we should note that the Ethics Handbook is clear: Plagiarism  taking someone elses work and intentionally presenting it as if it is your own  is theft. At NPR its an unforgivable offense.

The Handbook goes on to say:

That means no material from another source should ever be included verbatim, or substantially so, without attribution. This includes material from Associated Press reports. We do not, for example, produce news spots or other pieces that closely resemble wire service stories. NPRs standard is that our writing should be our own. There is no excuse for writing that repeats the wire stories that we use word-for-word, or nearly so.

Now, about how things were handled once we knew the extent of the problem.

We started from the position that when we make mistakes, we acknowledge them. Steps were taken to do that:

1. We stated as clearly as possible, in multiple places, what had happened and what we had done to correct the mistakes. Thats why there is an editors note signed by Mike Oreskes and WQXR General Manager Graham Parker, an editors note on top of the page where the stories in question were collected and editors notes on each of the 10 pages where the pieces originally appeared.

2. We did not try to hide the stories. They were all put on one page because we felt that would be a simple and user-friendly way to make them available to anyone who wanted to see what was in those pieces that had appeared elsewhere before.

3. We highlighted the words and phrases that had appeared elsewhere and linked to the places they had been drawn from. Again, we aimed to make it as simple as possible for anyone to see what had been done.

4. A headline and link to the main editors note was put on the NPR.org homepage.

5. The Two-Way was given no instructions other than to cover the news as it saw fit.

We will make mistakes, though hopefully none this serious. Steps similar to those taken in this situation may need to be repeated. Having them written down here may prove helpful in the future.

Before finishing, a couple more things should be noted.

The first sign that there was a problem came last Friday when copy editor Mark Mobley was checking an unusual spelling and came across a document with phrases much like those in the piece he was editing. He brought the duplication to the attention of editors at NPR Music. That was exactly the right thing to do. Mark was then asked to start going through the pieces the writer had done for NPR.org in the past. His research turned up the multiple examples.

Tom Huizenga, Jessica Goldstein and Jacob Ganz worked through this situation with what I would say was firm compassion. It is not easy to deal with news such as this when it involves a person you like and have enjoyed working with. They stayed focused on what was the right thing to do for NPR and its audience.

We all owe Mark, Tom, Jessica and Jacob a thanks.

What has happened to the GOP since it was trounced in the last presidential election? Henry Barbour, co-authored of the autopsy report, looks at whether his party paid attention to its conclusions.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Another round of presidential primaries has intensified the pressure on Republicans hoping to defeat Donald Trump. He won three primaries last night, including the big state of Michigan.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

Ted Cruz won a single state - Idaho. John Kasich won nowhere but had a strong showing in Michigan.

INSKEEP: Marco Rubio had one of his worst nights yet. He finished nowhere better than third and sometimes didn't even get 10 percent of the vote.

GREENE: We're going to talk through the Republican results and the future of the party with Henry Barbour. He is a Republican strategist, part of an important political family. He was co-author of a report trying to point the party in a new direction. He endorsed Marco Rubio and he's on the line now from Yazoo City, Miss. Good morning.

HENRY BARBOUR: Good morning.

INSKEEP: Got to ask you, what's wrong with your candidate?

BARBOUR: Well, look, every campaign has its ups and downs. And certainly Marco decided and the campaign decided to make a shift to focus on Florida, the 99 delegates. It's winner-take-all in Florida, is a win that he has to have. And so he's taken his positive and inspiring message to Florida, where we are going to vote next week on Tuesday, and what will be a blockbuster day for the campaign and a really decisive day for the campaign next Tuesday. Between now and next Tuesday, 433 delegates up for grabs. And 165 of them, between Ohio and Florida, are winner-take-all. So those are huge states.

INSKEEP: And you're sure that your candidate, Marco Rubio, will stay in the race through Florida, through that Tuesday result?

BARBOUR: Yeah, Marco is actually going to win next Tuesday. And certainly - look, the map was not good for him last night. And such is life. But in Florida, Sen. Rubio has been told before, look, you can't win. When he decided to run for the U.S. Senate the first time, he was told, you can't run. There's a sitting governor running for the Senate. And he took on the establishment. He was successful, had tea party support and did very well. And, you know, one of the things that's really positions him well in Florida is you've got about 60 percent, 65 percent of Republican voters voting against Donald Trump. So the vote in Florida for Marco Rubio essentially is you're a vehicle if you want to stop Donald Trump. And he has a big early vote advantage.

GREENE: Well, if - we want to turn to talk about Florida and that - sort of where the race is going. But let's hear first, if we can, you said the campaign is full of ups and downs. It was certainly an up moment for Donald Trump yesterday. And let's listen to our colleague Don Gonyea, who's been following the whole Republican race.

BARBOUR: Great.

DON GONYEA, BYLINE: There were some worrying signs for Donald Trump going into yesterday's primaries. His lead in national polls was narrowing. In primaries and caucuses over the weekend, he had not done as well as expected, especially among voters who decided late. But last night - well, last night looked a lot like Super Tuesday all over again. Here's how Trump described his challengers Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Marco Rubio.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: They didn't do so well tonight, folks, OK. I'm not going to say anybody didn't do well. They didn't do well. There's only one person did well tonight - Donald Trump. I will tell you. It's true.

(CHEERING)

GONYEA: Trump was declared the easy winner in the two biggest states yesterday - Michigan and Mississippi. All this despite a well-funded anti-Trump movement launched not just by his opponents but also by 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and super PACs that funded attack ads.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TRUMP: And I don't think I've ever had so many horrible, horrible things said about me in one week.

(LAUGHTER)

TRUMP: Thirty-eight million dollars worth of horrible lies, but that's OK. It shows you how brilliant the public is.

GONYEA: Trumps remarks, delivered at Trump National Golf Club, sometimes felt more like an ad for Trump-branded products stacked high on a table by the stage where Trump Wine, Trump Steaks, Trump Water, Trump Magazine. It was a rebuttal to Romney, who in a speech this past week listed some of these same products as Trump business failures. As for the other candidates, Ted Cruz spoke to his supporters at a rally in North Carolina even before he'd finished second in Michigan and Mississippi and before he scored a late win in the Idaho primary.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TED CRUZ: There is only one campaign that has beaten Donald Trump repeatedly and that can and will beat Donald Trump in this nomination.

GONYEA: Ohio Gov. John Kasich, meanwhile, speaking in Columbus, put an upbeat spin on a disappointing showing in Michigan, a state where he worked harder than any other candidate.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

JOHN KASICH: Listen, we are very pleased with what's happened and when you think about where we've come.

GONYEA: A few weeks ago, Kasich was in single digits in Michigan. He rose to a very respectable 24 percent of the vote but still came in third just behind Cruz. For Kasich now, it's a last stand back home where Ohio holds a big winner-take-all primary next Tuesday.

KASICH: We're all familiar with March Madness. And now the home court advantage is coming North. And next week we are going to win the state of Ohio. It will be a...

(APPLAUSE)

GONYEA: Cruz and Kasich's goal now is to deny Trump the 1,237 delegate votes needed for nomination at this summer's GOP convention. That's the big hope for Sen. Marco Rubio, as well. But his once-promising campaign finished dead last in Michigan and Mississippi yesterday - stuck in single digits with no delegates won. He spoke to supporters before polls closed.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MARCO RUBIO: And in this election it is not just a choice between candidates. We are deciding the definition of what it means to be a conservative in the 21st century. And we are deciding our identity as a nation and as a people.

GONYEA: Rubio now needs a big win in his home state of Florida next Tuesday. But he'll have to score an upset to get it. Ultimately, the day belonged to Trump. As long as multiple opponents continue to split the opposing vote, he can continue to add to his triple-digit delegate lead.

GREENE: That is NPR's Don Gonyea. And we were listening to that story with Henry Barbour, who's on the line. And he's a Republican strategist.

i toggle caption Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images

No matter where you are in Tucson, Ariz., you're no more than 20 miles from Saguaro National Park. The park and its tall, pronged, namesake cactus literally surround Tucson. There's the rounded top of the park's cactus-studded Wasson Peak to the west, the park's desert-to-forest Rincon Mountain Range to the east and about a million people living between.

But if you go around Tucson  to its historic barrio neighborhoods, swap meets or hiking trails  and ask people about their neighboring national park, you might be surprised.

""Saguaro High School?""

""I have no idea.""

""What's that?""

Darla Sidles, Saguaro National Park's superintendent, is not surprised by those responses. She knows better than most the disconnect that exists between a lot of locals here and the park next door. ""The type of people that are coming to the park versus the people just five minutes away in Tucson is really an issue for us here,"" she says.

The reason: The type of people that are coming to the park don't reflect the type of people living in the community. Tucson is about 44 percent Hispanic or Latino. Of the park's roughly 650,000 annual visitors, less than 2 percent self-identify as Hispanic. ""If we're not being relevant to almost half of the population, then 30, 40, 50 years from now, the park isn't going to matter to them,"" Sidles says.

A Call To Action

The disconnect between Tucson's minority populations and Saguaro National Park is striking given their proximity, but it's hardly unique.

The National Park Service overall has a diversity problem. There were a record 307.2 million visits to U.S. national parks in 2015, and it's fair to say that the majority of those visitors were white. The National Park Service doesn't track the demographics of its visitors, but the most recent survey commissioned by the Park Service to see how different populations groups related to the parks found that 9 percent of American visitors were Hispanic. African-Americans accounted for 7 percent. Asian-Americans were 3 percent. Collectively, minorities made up just over 20 percent of the visitors to national parks, despite the fact that they made up nearly 40 percent of the U.S. population.

toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR

""We know that visitation does not reflect the diversity of the nation,"" says Jon Jarvis, the director of the National Park Service. ""And that's a concern.""

It's a concern on multiple levels. For one, the national parks depend on public money, political support and community engagement for funding. The Census Bureau is projecting that non-whites will make up the majority of the U.S. population within the next 25 years. Urbanization is growing. And millennials are now the biggest generation in history. Add that all up and it's not hard to predict that multicultural, mostly-urban millennials ""will assume all seats of power and responsibilities for the nation,"" Jarvis says. ""So connecting to that generation is essential to the Park Service's ability to thrive in our second century.""

The other reason it's important to connect to all of America's shifting demographics, Jarvis says, is it's the Park Service's job. ""The Park Service has a responsibility that Congress and the president have granted us over our history,"" he says.

To that end, Jarvis has made increasing diversity at the national parks a top priority as the Park Service approaches its centennial. His Call to Action plan  a vision for the organization's future  states: ""In our second century, we will fully represent our nation's ethnically and culturally diverse communities.""

'This Is Not Your Space'



Figuring out why there's a disconnect between Tucson's minority groups and Saguaro National Park is about to be Cam Juarez's job. Juarez, from Tucson, is a leader in the Hispanic community serving on the city's school board. In a couple of weeks, he's going to start working for Saguaro National Park as their outreach coordinator.

toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR

Juarez getting a jump start on that by visiting a couple of schools in Tucson to ask parents, teachers, administrators and students if they know about Saguaro and, if not, why. He's also going to try to get them interested in the park and what it has to offer. ""It's like we're out there selling snake oil,"" he says on the way to a charter school in south Tucson, which is predominantly Hispanic. ""I'd wager to say that there's a whole lot of folks here that don't use the park, close as they are to it.""

In a way, Juarez is the perfect person for this job because he can relate. To date, he says, he's visited three national parks, including Saguaro. Growing up, his family never went to national parks. They never even talked about it. ""It just wasn't something we did,"" he says.

His family was poor. ""We didn't have camping gear or fishing gear,"" he says. ""We had hoes and shovels; work implements and school books.""

Even as he got older, Juarez says, he thought of national parks as a place for ""folks that were white or folks that had resources and sometimes you likened them to each other."" Either way, he didn't think the parks were for people like him.

He's not alone in that sentiment. That survey of park visitors released in 2011 found that non-whites were three times more likely to say that parks provide poor service and are not safe places to visit. And Juarez heard some of that at the schools he went to.

Oscar Medina, a teacher at Changemaker High School, talked about how he visited a park with his family ""and none of the information signs were in Spanish."" A mom at Carrillo Intermediate talked about how she wanted to go to Saguaro with her family, but there weren't facilities for a large group. Another pointed out there's no public transportation.

Some of the reasons were universal: the cost is prohibitive; not enough time because of work; the lack of shade in a desert park.

i toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR

Others were more subtle. Luis Perales, the chief academic officer at Changemaker High School, says that the reasons minorities, and particularly Latinos, aren't going to national parks is that ""spaces either are inviting or are rejecting in many ways. And I think a lot of what's been created [with national parks] is this idea that this is not your space.""

It's not that Latinos don't want to go outside. Go to any park or hiking trail in Tucson and you'll see that's not the case. It's that they might want to have a different experience in the outdoors. A lot of what the national parks promote is the solitude and quiet of a John Muir photo. ""Go out on your own, enjoy nature, don't harm it,"" Perales says. That messaging of ""rugged individualism"" doesn't necessarily work with Latinos, Perales says. ""It's like no, I'm going to bring my whole family, we're going to be loud, we're going to explore,"" he says. ""That's not what's promoted at this point. It has to be a compromise.""

'Reflect The Face Of The People We Want To Attract'

There's another reason that people gave for not feeling connected or welcome at the national parks, and it's one that many people danced around. Bella Furr, an intern and temporary worker at Saguaro National Park had no such qualms: ""The other thing is the Park Service is full of white men.""

That's not entirely accurate, but it's not far off the mark. According to the most recent survey, 80 percent of Park Service's roughly 22,000 employees are white. Anecdotally, people involved with the Park Service say, the demographics breakdown of the Park Service's estimated 220,000 volunteers is similar.

At Saguaro National Park, Sidles estimates about 75 percent of their workforce is white. ""We don't have as diverse a staff as we should have,"" she says. ""We have to reflect the face of the people we want to attract.""

That idea of reflecting the diversity of the public in its workforce is one the National Park Service has been pushing for a long time. Programs have been in put place nationally and initiatives have been launched, but little has changed. That's bred some cynicism about the service's efforts in some quarters. One former long-time National Park Service employee interviewed for this story not-so-jokingly said that the National Park Service could also be celebrating the centennial of its efforts to be more diverse.

There's a myriad of reasons park managers and officials give for the slow rate of change. There's the labyrinthian federal job application system as well as preferential hiring mandates that can keep the resumes of diverse, local candidates off of hiring manager's desks. More directly, there's low job turnover and few new opportunities for diverse candidates. With baby boomers nearing retirement though, that's expected to change and open opportunities for more diversity.

i toggle caption Nathan Rott/NPR Nathan Rott/NPR

Saguaro National Park wants to be ready for that opportunity and being ready means having young, diverse, experienced candidates for jobs as they come open. That's why they've partnered with the nonprofit group Friends of Saguaro National Park to hire a group of young locals like Yesenia Gamez on temporary contracts.

Gamez is what's called a Next Generation Ranger. She works at Saguaro National Park's visitor centers and in its interior, but she also works in Tucson, visiting local schools and working at information stands at local events.

On a recent weekend, she showed off a big bleached grizzly bear skull to a group of young kids at community health event at a park in downtown Tucson. They guessed what animal it was.

Gamez says she loves doing events like this because she gets to interact with people who otherwise don't get to experience the park. ""People that come to the park are usually retirees who can drive out there,"" she says. ""This is a low socioeconomic thing. It's in the heart of Tucson. It's kind of like we're bringing the park to them.""

By doing that, she says, the Next Gen Rangers can provide a friendly, familiar face and appeal to people where they're comfortable. They can also tell younger versions of themselves about the opportunities that exist in the National Park Service  if those opportunities exist.",[]
npr.org,2015-02-18 00:00:00,"Why you should always use ""transgender"" instead of ""transgendered""",['German Lopez'],"Questions of language are deeply ingrained in the fight for transgender rights and equality. It's not just a matter of being polite. If someone calls a trans man a woman, it fundamentally cuts against the person's gender identity.

But there are still big barriers, even among traditionally liberal media outlets, toward getting the basics of trans-inclusive vocabulary right. A recent story in the New Republic referred to trans people as ""transgendered,"" ""transman,"" and ""transwomen""  all of which are offensive to many trans people.

BuzzFeed LGBT Editor Saeed Jones echoed some of the offense in a recent tweet:

Also, its ""transgender,"" not ""transgendered."" ""Transgendered"" is the linguistic equivalent of describing someone as ""blacked.""  Saeed Jones (@theferocity) February 17, 2015

Getting this right isn't just a matter of being inclusive toward trans people, although that should be reason enough. It can also help readers become familiar with the correct terms.

As New York Times Public Editor Margaret Sullivan explained last week, one of the major challenges for news outlets is that most readers just aren't familiar with how to correctly refer to people with non-traditional gender identities. And in some cases, referring to someone with the correct terms can be a little confusing  calling Chelsea Manning, a transgender soldier who's in prison for leaking secret US documents, ""she"" after years of addressing her in news stories as ""he"" may have confused some readers, even though using the correct pronoun for Manning is the right editorial call.

Of course, there are ways around this. A writer could explain what the terms mean within a story. News outlets could link readers to clear definitions, similar to what BuzzFeed does with its house style guide. Stories could also point readers to more in-depth glossaries, like the GLAAD Media Reference Guide or UC Berkeley Gender Equity Resource Center's definition of terms.

Most importantly, media outlets have to first get the terms right for themselves. But two common mistakes persist, as seen in the New Republic's use of the terms ""transgendered,"" ""transman,"" and ""transwoman."" Here's why those terms are not just inaccurate but can cause such great offense when they're used.

Transgender vs. transgendered

The umbrella term for people who identify with a gender different than the one assigned to them at birth is ""transgender"" or ""trans."" These words are adjectives, not nouns. Additionally, the word ""transgendered"" is offensive to trans people and unnecessarily confusing.

As trans advocate Joanne Herman noted in the Huffington Post, calling someone transgendered is a bit like calling someone ""colored."" ""One problem with this label was that it implied something happened to make the person 'of color,' which denied the person's dignity of being born that way,"" Herman wrote. Similarly, transgendered suggests that being trans is something that happens to someone, as opposed to an identity someone is born with.

The implication behind transgendered flies in the face of science: people can know their gender identity at a very young age. A recent study from the TransYouth Project found that transgender children as young as five years old respond to psychological gender-association tests, which evaluate how people view themselves within gender roles, as quickly and consistently as those who don't identify as trans.

Transgendered is also unnecessarily long and confusing. LGBT group GLAAD explained: ""The adjective transgender should never have an extraneous '-ed' tacked onto the end. An '-ed' suffix adds unnecessary length to the word and can cause tense confusion and grammatical errors. It also brings transgender into alignment with lesbian, gay, and bisexual. You would not say that Elton John is 'gayed' or Ellen DeGeneres is 'lesbianed,' therefore you would not say Chaz Bono is 'transgendered.'""

Trans men and trans women vs. transmen and transwomen

A trans man is someone who identifies as a man but was designated female at birth. A trans woman is someone who identifies as a woman but was designated male at birth. Some trans people prefer to leave the word transgender or trans out altogether, since they only identify as a man or woman.

Writers shouldn't use ""transman"" or ""transwoman."" The word trans is an adjective that helps describe someone's gender identity, and it should be treated like other adjectives. Merging the adjective and the noun risks suggesting that a trans man or woman is more (or less) than just a man or just a woman, which goes against how many trans people identify themselves.

npr.org,,Dont Be Careless With The Word Countless,[],"Dont Be Careless With The Word Countless

Its tempting to say that weve used one word a countless number of times.

But that would be wrong, because we can quantify it:

 Countless showed up 255 times in the past year on NPR.org.

 The word is in 112 broadcast transcripts from that same period.

There are two points to make about this:

 We (and our guests) use the word too much. We cannot have found that many things that qualify as countless.

 We (and our guests) often misuse the word, either because what were talking about can be counted or because a better word would paint a clearer picture. Countless just ends up sounding like a throwaway word that conveys little information.

This is the point in this post where we should go the dictionary. The adjective countless is defined as too many to count; innumerable; myriad. If you want to make the case that youre using it as a synonym for myriad, please be prepared to prove that youre speaking of an indefinitely large number.

A pretty good use of the word was a reference we made to the countless other people around the world who showed support for the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists. That group could be considered an indefinitely large number. (Might millions have been a better word? Theres a case to be made that the answer is yes.)

A poor use of the word was this headline: The Countless Lives Of Lauren Bacall. The appreciation of her life that ran with the headline details about a dozen times she reinvented herself. Thats not indefinitely large.

What to say instead? A look through our reports shows that, depending on the context, more precise words would have included:

 Many

 Dozens

 Hundreds

 Thousands

 Millions

 Billions

By the way, it is not a job requirement that reporters covering the 2016 campaign always put countless before the words handshakes, pork chops, county fairs, town halls and stump speeches.

SALIE: The Vatican has a confession to make. For the past two and a half weeks, tourists have encountered scaffolding obscuring Raphael's most famous work ""The School Of Athens."" Museum officials were hoping disappointed art lovers would just assume that the restoration of the masterpiece is on Italian time. But when recently pressed to explain the delay, Romia Cametti, chief of the Vatican Laboratories of Restoration, admitted to the media that her lab engineers have run out of paint. Specifically, the paint needed to touch up Socrates' amber robe. You see, by the laws of their own municipality, Vatican restoration artists must work with the exact same pigment that Raphael used. Problem is the only way to produce that particular color is to mix Persian saffron with the poop of an endangered species called the Tuscan turtledove. The Vatican has only one such dove in captivity, and he named Rocco. And Rocco is well, constipated...

SALIE: Or (foreign language spoken) as they say. Dramatic appeals have been made to his bowels, including around-the-clock rosary circle prayed by the sisters of perpetual regularity.

In an official statement, Disney has claimed that Eeyore suffers from depression.

POUNDSTONE: He has been put on mandatory unpaid leave and required to seek counseling and a more permanent tail repair.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Eeyore misbehaving at Disney World. Their excuse - he's depressed. Your last story of someone telling the truth - they swear - comes from Roy Blount, Jr.

ROY BLOUNT, JR.: Citizens of Brussels, Belgium, want to know why is Brussels' motor vehicle traffic so chaotic, so prone to gridlock? Officials of Brussels answer mice. What, too many mice on the roads? No, it's because some many of our underground tunnels are crumbling. And that's caused by - mice. Mice? Mice ate the tunnels? No, mice ate the plans - the master plans that could have been used to repair the crumbling tunnels.

(LAUGHTER)

BLOUNT: You know, you store master plans away inside a pier, under a viaduct for 20 years and then you go find them and mice already have. Well, this explanation has inspired a rich strain of mirth in Belgium and especially in neighboring France, where even Belgian people are regarded as comical. And blame it on the mice jokes abound. Unfortunately, to American ears, all these jokes sound like mice speaking untranslatable Walloon-inflected French, sort of like (foreign language spoken, laughter).

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So here are the three stories.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: I will present them to you, Jay, in the form of the excuse. Was it from Faith - oh, I'm sorry we can't finish the restoration of this famous painting because we don't have the paint because the birds won't poop, from Paula Poundstone - oh, I'm sorry, Eeyore was behaving badly here at Disney World; he was just really depressed or from Roy Blount Jr. - oh, we can't fix the infrastructure here in Brussels. The mice ate all the plans? Which of these was the real excuse offered this week?

STEWART: I really want A to be the truth.

SAGAL: You want the story of the poop paint in Rome?

SALIE: God bless you, Jay.

SAGAL: The pontiff's poop paint, in fact.

STEWART: I change a lot of diapers.

SAGAL: I understand.

SAGAL: All right, well, that's your choice. Let's hear from somebody who knows a little bit about this real excuse.

NIRAJ CHOKSHI: When they went back 20 years later, they couldn't find the plans. His best guess as to what happened was that they were eaten by mice.

SAGAL: That was Niraj Chokshi. That's the journalist who wrote about the Belgian mice for The Washington Post. So I'm sorry, you didn't win. But you earned a point for Faith, which might have been your intent, I think, judging the way you approached this. So thank you for doing that. Thanks so much for playing, Jay, good-bye.

Since we started making Tiny Desk Concerts almost eight years ago, we've had more than 500 artists play the Tiny Desk, our own little makeshift concert venue right in the middle of NPR's offices in DC. From huge stars like Adele to T-Pain to up-and-comers like Car Seat Headrest and actual big bands like Mucca Pazza, all these musicians actually play behind MY desk  but I move out of the way when they set up.

This is one of the things that always surprises people when they visit NPR: that the Tiny Desk isn't a set. So we decided to give everyone a peek behind the scenes on a Monday afternoon earlier this month, when Wilco just happened to be stopping by.

We invited a company called RYOT to bring two 360-degree cameras to our offices and put them right in the front row of the audience. Then we filmed the whole thing, starting before Wilco even set up, before the staff flocked from all over the building to see the band play. Not only can you see the band up close, but if you look around, you'll see everything else that goes into making a Tiny Desk concert. You'll see our brilliant and calm engineer, Josh Rogosin. You'll see our lead videographer and producer of Tiny Desk Concerts, Niki Walker, along with her intern, Kara Frame. Then, of course, there's the crowd  what a lucky bunch. Many of them work here, many are lucky friends of people who work here. You'd probably recognize some of the voices in this radio crowd.

If you've never watched a 360-degree video before, we can help. There's lots to look around and spot  in fact, if you look really carefully, you might be able to find seven of Wilco's album covers around the desk and references to each one that we hid in the crowd. And of course, enjoy the song itself, one of Wilco's unforgettable tunes, ""Misunderstood"" from the 1996 album Being There. In front starting from the left you'll see Mikael Jorgensen playing the melodica, Nels Cline on that resonator guitar, Jeff Tweedy singing and strumming, John Stirratt playing guitar and singing strongly alongside Jeff and Pat Sansone on banjo and glockenspiel. In the back, holding it all together and sometimes tearing it apart, is drummer Glenn Kotche.

And when you're all done here, you can watch Wilco play all four of the songs they performed at this Tiny Desk concert. For those of us here at NPR, you can guess how boring the day seemed after this.",[]

i Matailong Du/NPR Matailong Du/NPR

In 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, by a vote of 8 to 1, to uphold a state's right to forcibly sterilize a person considered unfit to procreate. The case, known as Buck v. Bell, centered on a young woman named Carrie Buck, whom the state of Virginia had deemed to be ""feebleminded.""

Author Adam Cohen tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that Buck v. Bell was considered a victory for America's eugenics movement, an early 20th century school of thought that emphasized biological determinism and actively sought to ""breed out"" traits that were considered undesirable.

""There were all kinds of categories of people who were deemed to be unfit [to procreate],"" Cohen says. ""The eugenicists looked at evolution and survival of the fittest, as Darwin was describing it, and they believed 'We can help nature along, if we just plan who reproduces and who doesn't reproduce.' ""

All told, as many as 70,000 Americans were forcibly sterilized during the 20th century. The victims of state-mandated sterilization included people like Buck who had been labeled ""mentally deficient,"" as well as those who who were deaf, blind and diseased. Minorities, poor people and ""promiscuous"" women were often targeted.

Cohen's new book about the Buck case, Imbeciles, takes its name from the terms eugenicists used to categorize the ""feebleminded."" In it, he revisits the Buck v. Bell ruling and explores the connection between the American eugenics movement and the rise of the Nazi party in Germany.

Cohen notes that the instinct to ""demonize"" people who are different is still prevalent in the U.S. today, particularly in the debate over immigration.

""I think these instincts to say that we need to stop these other people from 'polluting us,' from changing the nature of our country, they're very real,"" Cohen warns. ""The idea that those who don't remember the past are condemned to repeat it  it's very troubling that we don't remember this past.""

Interview Highlights

On the case of Carrie Buck

This is this poor young woman, really nothing wrong with her physically or mentally, a victim of a terrible sexual assault, and there's a little hearing, she's declared feebleminded and she gets sent off to the colony for epileptics and feebleminded. ...

Imbeciles The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck by Adam Cohen Hardcover, 402 pages | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

When she's at the colony, the guy who is running the colony, Dr. Albert Priddy, is on the prowl. He's looking for someone to put at the center of this test case that they want to bring, so he's looking for someone to sterilize, and he sees Carrie Buck when she comes in, he does the examination himself, and there are a lot of things about her that excite him. She is deemed to be feebleminded, she has a mother who is feebleminded, so that's good because you can show some genetics, and then they're hoping that [her] baby could be determined to be feebleminded too, then you could really show a genetic pattern of feeblemindedness. The fact that she had been pregnant out of wedlock was another strike against her. So he fixes on her and thinks Carrie Buck is going to be the perfect potential plaintiff. ...

He chooses her, and then under the Virginia law, they have to have a sterilization hearing at the colony, which they do and they give her a lawyer (who is really not a lawyer for her; it's really someone who had been the chairman of the board of the colony and was sympathetic to the colony's side) and they have a bit of a sham hearing where she is determined to be a suitable person for sterilization; they vote to sterilize her, and that is the order that then gets challenged by Carrie as the plaintiff first in the Virginia court system and then in the Supreme Court.

On why he considers Buck v. Bell to be one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in American history

If you start by just looking at all the human misery that was inflicted, about 70,000 Americans were sterilized as a result of this decision, so that's an awful lot of people who wanted to have children who weren't able to have children. Also, we have to factor in all the many people who were being segregated, who were being held in these institutions for eugenic reasons, because they were feebleminded, whose lives unfolded living in places like the colony, rather than living in freedom. Beyond the human effect though, there was something just so ugly about this decision and when [we] think about what we want the Supreme Court to be, what the founders wanted the Supreme Court to be, it was supposed to be our temple of justice, the place that people could go when all the other parts of our society, all the other parts of the government, were not treating them right.

On how eugenicists sought to address the ""threat"" to the gene pool

The eugenicists saw two threats to the national gene pool: One was the external one, which they were addressing through immigration law; the other was the internal one  what to do about the people who were already here. They had a few ideas.

The first eugenics law in the United States was passed in Connecticut in 1895, and it was a law against certain kinds of marriages. They were trying to stop certain unfit people from reproducing through marriage. It wasn't really what they wanted, though, because they realized that people would just reproduce outside of marriage.

So their next idea was what they called segregation. The idea was to get people who were deemed unfit institutionalized during their reproductive years, particularly for women, keep them there, make sure they didn't reproduce, and then women were often let go when they had passed their reproductive years because they were no longer a threat to the gene pool. That had a problem too, though. The problem was that it would be really expensive to segregate, institutionalize the number of people the eugenicists were worried about. ...

Their next idea was eugenic sterilization and that allowed for a model in which they would take people in to institutions, eugenically sterilize them, and then they could let them go, because they were no longer a threat. That's why eugenic sterilization really became the main model that the eugenicists embraced and that many states enacted laws to allow.

On deeming people ""feebleminded""

""Feebleminded"" was really the craze in American eugenics. There was this idea that we were being drowned in a tide of feeblemindedness  that basically unintelligent people were taking over, reproducing more quickly than the intelligent people  but it was also a very malleable term that was used to define large categories of people that again, were disliked by someone who was in the decision-making position. So, women who were thought to be overly interested in sex, licentious, were sometimes deemed feebleminded. It was a broad category and it was very hard to prove at one of these feeblemindedness hearings that you were not feebleminded.

On the involuntary sterilization procedure

For men it was something like a vasectomy. For women it was a salpingectomy, where they cauterized the path that the egg takes toward fertilization. It was, in the case of women, not minor surgery and when you read about what happened, it's many, many days of recovery and it had certain dangers attached to it, and a lot of the science was still quite new. ...

When you add onto all that, the fact that in many, many cases the women involved were not told what was being done to them, they might be told that they were having an appendectomy, they weren't being told that the government has decided that you are unfit to reproduce and we're then going to have surgery on you, so that just compounds the horror of the situation.

On how the Nazis borrowed from the U.S. eugenics sterilization program

We really were on the cutting edge. We were doing a lot of this in the 1910s and 1920s. Indiana adopted a eugenic sterilization law, America's first in 1907. We were writing the eugenics sterilization statutes that decided who should be sterilized. We also had people who were writing a lot of what might be thought of as pro-Aryan theory. So you have people like Madison Grant who wrote a very popular book called The Passing of a Great Race, which really talked about the superiority of Nordics, as he called them, and how they were endangered by all the brown people and the non-Nordics who were taking over.

On a 1924 immigration law, which was inspired by eugenicists, that prevented Anne Frank's family from entering the U.S.

Under the old immigration laws where it was pretty much ""show up,"" they would've been able to emigrate, but suddenly they were trapped by very unfavorable national quotas, so this really was a reason that so many Jews were turned away.

One very poignant aspect of it that I've thought about as I was working on the book is in the late '90s some correspondence appeared, was uncovered, in which Otto Frank was writing repeatedly to the State Department begging for visas for himself and his wife and his two daughters, Margot and Anne, and was turned down, and that was because there were now these quotas in place. If they had not been, it seems clear that he would've been able to get a visa for his whole family, including his daughter Anne Frank.

So when we think about the fact that Anne Frank died in a concentration camp, we're often told that it was because the Nazis believed the Jews were genetically inferior, that they were lesser than Aryans. That's true, but to some extent Anne Frank died in a concentration camp because the U.S. Congress believed that as well.",[]

Democrat Cory Booker, formerly the mayor of Newark, is now a senator and a frequent entry on ""Washington's Most Eligible Bachelors"" lists. We've invited him to play a game called ""New Jersey? I prefer Old Jersey!"" Three questions about old sports jerseys.

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

And now the game where we ask important people about very unimportant things. Sen. Cory Booker began his public career as mayor of Newark, a city that people said could never come back. But he went there, and he famously repainted the entire city - himself. That got him elected to the U.S. Senate. He joins us now from a terminal at Washington National Airport. Sen. Cory Booker, welcome to WAIT WAIT... DONT TELL ME.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: So - so you grew up in New Jersey - as I did - and both of us got out. And you went back. What brought you back? Did someone have some dirt on you?

CORY BOOKER: (Laughter) Listen, don't get my Jersey pride going. We are the most densely-populated state in America 'cause some many people who know the secret want to live there.

SAGAL: Oh, is that why?

BOOKER: Yes.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So you were - you became the mayor of Newark as a relatively young man. And Newark at that time did not have a good reputation.

BOOKER: No. I think that was one of the problems. We were one of America's most underestimated cities. It was a city that had a lot of challenges. But after all eight years of work, it's had its biggest economic development boom in 60 years. I'm really proud.

SAGAL: Yeah, yeah, that's so great. Tell us about the Hot Pockets.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: No because I - this is - one of the great things about your career as the mayor of Newark is you were constantly, like, doing stuff for people. You were out shoveling walks and - but there was an incident during - it was during Hurricane Sandy, right?

BOOKER: Sometimes I'd get the strangest requests. And during Hurricane Sandy - I couldn't believe it, but I saw somebody tweet me and asked me to bring them some Hot Pockets. So I jokingly told them hey, this is a problem you can handle. I believe in you. But the next thing I knew, the company Hot Pockets sent me a thousand free coupons for Hot Pockets, which I donated to a food pantry, except for I gave a few to the young man who was bold enough in the midst of a hurricane to ask me for Hot Pockets.

SAGAL: Did you ever actually stop a crime in progress, like Batman?

BOOKER: I am definitely not Batman. And in fact, as I write about in my book, I did stupid things. So yeah, a couple of times I got involved in some foot chases and other incidents.

SAGAL: Oh, wait a minute, like what?

BOOKER: Well, in my first couple weeks in office, I was coming out of City Hall and there was an armed bank robbery going on. And so I gave chase to the robber who had just held up a woman who was making a deposit. Then he got caught by a police officer, swung at him with his knife. Thank God it only ripped his shirt. And I came upon the situation while the officer had drawn his gun on a crowded sidewalk and just thought to myself this is a bad situation. And very imprudently, I decided I didn't want the officer to shoot so that I would sprint at the man with the knife. And he fortunately did what I hoped he would do, which is not to stand there but actually turn and run.

SAGAL: Wait a minute.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So - so a few moments ago when I asked you if you ever actually prevented a crime and you said no, what you really meant was yes that you actually...

BOOKER: No.

SAGAL: ...Apprehended a bank robber.

BOBCAT GOLDTHWAIT: No, he said he's not Batman.

(LAUGHTER)

ADAM BURKE: Now that's government in action.

SAGAL: It really is.

BOOKER: Yes, yes.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: But that sounds like fun. So now you're in the Senate. How miserable is that, Sen. Booker?

BOOKER: Well (laughter) it's a lot easier to chase down Mitch McConnell then it is...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So...

BOOKER: No, it's - look, it's a challenge. We have a government that has problems that are well-celebrated. But despite all that, you know, I've gotten legislation passed with everybody from Ted Cruz to even today worked with Marco Rubio and Cory Gardner.

SAGAL: Wait a minute, Marco Rubio was there?

BOOKER: No, but we have legislation together.

SAGAL: All right, so you've worked with Ted Cruz. I have to say - I've never met the man; I've read a lot about him; he doesn't seem popular with his colleagues. Do you get along with him? Do you like him?

BOOKER: You know, in America, our differences matter but our country matters more. That's the attitude I wanted to take to the Senate. And it's been fruitful so far in the first few years.

SAGAL: So what I feel you're saying - what I feel you're saying, senator, is that he's a total jerk face.

(LAUGHTER)

ROXANNE ROBERTS: No Peter, what the senator is too modest to say is that everybody likes him. He likes everybody. He's little Mr. Sunshine. He's gorgeous.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Hang on a second. Now, you actually - Roxanne, thank you for bringing this up - Sen. Booker, you were one of Town & Country Magazine's Top 40 Bachelors. You were named that. You're a well-known single man about town in Washington. What's it like - what's it like in Washington, you know, when the world is your oyster, you've got no strings attached?

BOOKER: Well, it's not the best thing. I don't recommend it if you want a date to be a United States senator. There are definitely a lot of constrictions. It's not the kind of job where you just jump on, you know, match.com or Tinder or something like that and try to meet people. It's...

SAGAL: Why not? Can you imagine how exciting that would be for the young ladies of Washington to be looking at their Tinder and going oh my God, it's Cory Booker - right, right, right, right.

BURKE: Also - also, think back to your mayor days when you showed up at peoples' front door with a present. Like, just do that.

(LAUGHTER)

BOOKER: I have a feeling that this whole conversation my mom put you up to it.

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

BOOKER: You know, this is taking a turn in a direction I did not (unintelligible).

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: No, no, no, can you tell us what you're looking for? Maybe we can find out if one of our - I'm guessing if you like people who listen to NPR, we can help you out.

BOOKER: Well, can I tell you about criminal just reform or tax reform instead?

SAGAL: Yeah, yeah, I think a lot of people listening just decided to maybe go hit on the Dick Durbin instead.

SAGAL: Well, Sen. Cory Booker, what a pleasure to talk to you. We've asked you here to play a play game called...

BILL KURTIS: New Jersey? I Prefer Old Jersey.

BOOKER: Oh.

SAGAL: Yes, senator, you're a life-long resident and champion in New Jersey. But what do you know about old jersey, specifically old sports jerseys? Answer two of our three questions correctly, you'll win our prize for one of our listeners - Carl Kasell's voice on their voicemail. Bill, who is Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey playing for?

KURTIS: Gary Currier of Oregon City, Ore.

BOOKER: All right, I'm ready.

SAGAL: Fans love - love - the jerseys of their favorite players. You know that. One fan expressed his fandom in a very sincere way. What was it? A, one Christopher Lackner of Chicago, Ill., every day has his wife shave the number 34 into his back hair, in honor of the late Walter Payton, B, in 2005, a prisoner successfully lobbied to have his prison sentence raised from 30 to 33 years in honor of number 33 Larry Bird, or C, an Atlantan named BJ Maxwell only dates women who are 31 years old in honor of number 31 on the Braves, Greg Maddux.

BOOKER: Wow, OK.

(LAUGHTER)

BOOKER: I cannot believe I'm saying these two words on a national radio show - back hair.

SAGAL: You're going to go for the guy who has the number 34 shaved into his back to honor sweetness, Walter Payton?

BOOKER: Yes.

SAGAL: No. I'm afraid no. It was actually the prisoner.

(LAUGHTER)

BOOKER: It was a guy in Oklahoma, and he got sentenced to 30 years. And he said no, I want 33 'cause he said if I was going to go down, he was going to go down in Larry Bird's jersey number. All right, you still have two more chances here, senator.

BOOKER: OK, this is pressure. Go ahead.

SAGAL: Yeah. There are tributes out there to athlete's jersey numbers that you may not know about, such as one of these. Is it A, Colt 45 malt liquor named not for the famous gun but for football player Jerry Hill, number 45 for the Baltimore Colts, B, Heinz 57, named for Pittsburgh Pirates legend Frank Bork, or C, Adele's record ""21,"" which she named for Manchester United star footballer Ander Herrera.

BOOKER: Wow, wow. I've always thought Colt 45 was the weapon, and I would love the opportunity to talk with you about sensible gun safety.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: You know...

BURKE: Nicely done.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Sen. Booker - Sen. Booker, no offense but as we talk, I'm getting a clear idea of why you're single.

(LAUGHTER)

BOOKER: I'm really disappointed you don't think infrastructure is sexy.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, so you were just about to make your choice. So which is it going to be?

BOOKER: I'm going to go with the Colt 45 with the understanding that we're going to do more to get guns out of the hands of...

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: You are...

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: You are incorrigible, sir. You're also right.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: It turns out - we were surprised, too.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Colt 45 named not for the gun but for a Baltimore Colts star of yesteryear, number 45. All right, last question. If you get this right, you win. Archie Manning - he's the father of Peyton and Eli Manning and some other more boring kids. He wore number 18 when he was a football star at Ole Miss, a fact everyone there in Oxford still remembers. Why? A, because they carved the number 18 into the back of Jefferson Davis' jacket on his statue in the middle of campus, B, because the campus speed limit at Ole Miss is at an annoyingly-slow 18 miles per hour in his honor or C, because to this day you can buy his favorite meal - a dozen boiled crawfish and a can of Abita beer for 18 cents.

BOOKER: Wow. OK, well, number one is definitely not it. And in this day and age in America and our economy, I don't think you can get much for 18 cents anymore. So I'm going to stick with traffic safety 'cause it might give me a chance to talk about the importance of infrastructure.

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: That's amazing.

SAGAL: You - honestly, Sen. Booker, you are unstoppable. And you are right. The answer was the speed limit...

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: And not only has it been 18 for years because of Archie Manning, in 2012, it was slowed down to honor his son, who wore number 10. And drivers were not happy. Bill, how did Sen. Booker do on our quiz?

KURTIS: He won - 2 out of 3, senator. Congratulations.

SAGAL: Thank you, very well done.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Cory Booker's book ""United"" is out now. Sen. Cory Booker, thank you so much for joining us here on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.

BOOKER: Thank you.

SAGAL: Thank you, sir. Take care.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""I LIKE JERSEY BEST"")

JOHN PIZZARELLI: (Singing) I've been a lot of places, seen pictures of the rest. But of all the places I can think of, I like Jersey best.

SAGAL: In just a minute, you can fly like an eagle in our Listener Limerick Challenge. Call 1-888-WAIT-WAIT to join us on the air. We'll be back with more of WAIT WAIT... DONT TELL ME from NPR.

i toggle caption Jeffrey Vock/Getty Images Jeffrey Vock/Getty Images

Pat Conroy, the beloved author of The Great Santini, The Lords of Discipline and The Prince of Tides, has died. Conroy  who announced last month that he had pancreatic cancer  died Friday night at his home among his family in Beaufort, S.C. He was 70 years old.

Pat Conroy was a master storyteller, blending the raw material of his difficult family life with the landscape of coastal South Carolina. In 1986, Conroy told me that the reason he wrote was to explain his own life to himself.

""Writing has been not therapeutic for me, but it has been essential,"" he said in an interview for Morning Edition. ""I have written about my mother, my father, my family ... and if I get it on paper, I have named the demon.""

Conroy's best known work is The Prince of Tides, a novel about a troubled South Carolina native recounting his story to a New York psychiatrist.

The prologue begins: ""My wound is geography.""

I was born and raised on a Carolina sea island and I carried the sunshine of the low country, inked in dark gold, on my back and shoulders. As a boy I was happy above the channels, navigating a small boat between the sandbars with their quiet nation of oysters exposed on the brown flats at the low watermark.

Nan Talese was Pat Conroy's editor for the past 35 years, beginning with The Prince of Tides  a span that saw Conroy's book sales rise to a total of 20 million copies worldwide.

She recalled the first thing he said to her when they met. ""He said, 'I will tell you, if there are ten words for something, I will use all ten. Your job is to take them out.'""

Talese said Conroy touched people with his language and his honesty.

""His incredible sense of empathy with people. ... I think that his books influenced a lot of people because he was so open and honest. And it really struck their hearts.""

Pat Conroy was born in 1945 in Atlanta. He was a self-described ""military brat."" His family moved every year until they settled in Beaufort when he was 12.

YouTube

In his 1976 book The Great Santini, Conroy wrote about his relationship with his abusive father, a Marine aviator. In the 1979 film version of the story, the father is played by Robert Duvall. In one scene, he addresses his four young children after a move, as if they are soldiers under his command.

After high school, Pat Conroy's father sent his oldest son to The Citadel, Charleston's storied military academy, where Pat began to write fiction. Conroy said his natural storytelling ability was never affected by literary theory.

""I missed all the classes in the art of fiction,"" Conroy said in 1986. ""We didn't have any. I'm great on military science. But I missed all the classes on 'Is this a great technique for fiction?' I never learned any of that stuff.""

His education as a writer came elsewhere.

""I came from a family of great storytellers,"" he said. ""That is something about the South I think has been preserved.

And he said he faced challenges along the way. ""The one thing I've had is a very painful life filled with utter moments of great joy. Things happen to me for reasons I cannot figure out. And things have continued to happen to me all my life, and happen to my family all my life, and now happen to my friends. ...

Iran's military tested two ballistic missiles Wednesday, and an Iranian officer says the missiles are designed to reach Israel, according to an Iranian news agency. Iran has conducted a number of other ballistic missile tests this week.

The tests, which come after Iran won sanctions relief in January by curbing its nuclear program, seem to be ""aimed at demonstrating that Iran will push forward with its ballistic program,"" The Associated Press reports.

NPR's Peter Kenyon tells our Newscast unit that ""the tests may violate a U.N. Security Council resolution barring Iran from test-firing missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons."" Here's more from Peter:

""Iran says its missiles aren't designed for nuclear weapons. The U.S. says Iran's missile program is not part of last year's nuclear agreement, but Iran has warned that any new sanctions could mean an end to the deal.""

Iran's Press TV has video of the ballistic missile launch on its website. You can watch it here.

As Reuters reports, ""the missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran."" Additionally, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ""maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East.""

Iran denies that this test was ""provocative,"" according to the wire service.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest told journalists that the reported missile launches underscore the importance of the nuclear deal with Iran. ""Iran is working aggressively to try to enhance their ballistic missile capability, and preventing them from being able to nuclearize their missiles is  is obviously important to our national security here in the United States,"" he says.

Earnest adds that it ""would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days.""

NPR's Michele Kelemen says the State Department and the White House are taking a ""cautious line"" on the missile test. The State Department says ""Secretary of State John Kerry raised this in a phone call with his Iranian counterpart,"" Michele reports.

Hillary Clinton took a harder line than the current administration. She said in a statement that Iran's ""blatant violation"" of the Security Council resolution should have ""consequences."" She adds: ""Iran should face sanctions for these activities, and the international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats toward Israel will not be tolerated.""",[]

A NASA mission to Mars that was originally scheduled to launch this month  then was canceled when a flaw was discovered in a pivotal piece of equipment  is back on the calendar. If all goes well, it will launch in 2018.

The InSight mission  or ""Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport"" mission  has been in the works since 2012. It will send a lander to the Red Planet to measure Mars' seismic activity and interior temperature, among other things.

Data on marsquakes and the planet's interior heat will help researchers better understand Mars' ""deep interior,"" NASA says. That, in turn, could help expand scientists' understanding of the formation of all rocky planets, including Earth.

The original launch was planned for March 2016. But in December, the mission had to be suspended because a flaw in the lander's French-built seismometer couldn't be fixed in time.

The instrument needs to work inside a vacuum ""to provide the exquisite sensitivity needed for measuring ground movements as small as half the radius of a hydrogen atom,"" NASA says  and the container needed to maintain that vacuum was leaking.

At the time, it wasn't clear if the mission would be postponed or called off altogether. But on Wednesday, NASA announced that it would resume work on the project.

No matter how quickly the vacuum issue is resolved, March 5, 2018, is the earliest the mission could launch. That window of opportunity depends on the alignment of the orbits of Earth and Mars.

The InSight mission is a part of NASA's Discovery Program, in which scientists compete for approval of relatively low-cost planetary missions. (The total cost of InSight was to be capped at $675 million, Science Magazine reported last December. At that time, NASA had already spent $525 million, and the space agency is currently assessing the cost added by the two-year delay.)

When InSight was picked, it beat out two other finalists  one that would have sent a probe to a comet to hop across its surface and study multiple locations, and another that would have sent a boat to Titan, one of the moons of Saturn, to travel across its hydrocarbon oceans.

NASA is currently in the process of selecting the next Discovery Program mission  or missions  from a set of five finalists, including projects studying Venus and a probe to land on a metallic asteroid.

NASA had originally suggested it might select two winners, instead of just one, this year. It's not yet clear if InSight's rescheduled launch will affect that decision or any other planned NASA missions.",[]

The presidential campaign, particularly the debates, and breaking news events such as this weeks mass shooting in Oregon draw many of us to social media. We want to monitor the news, post our reporting, share the interesting information we find and offer our thoughts.

Thats great. Have fun out there.

But ... (theres always a but) ... all of us  journalists as well as those in other departments  need to remember that what we post and retweet can reflect on NPR. None of us want NPRs reputation for fairness to be put in doubt because of things we do on digital platforms.

Weve issued guidance on this before. Everyone is expected to be familiar with our thinking. Please reread:

 The Social Media section of the handbook. The introduction specifically mentions NPRs journalists, but the principles apply to others here as well. If youre in doubt, talk to your supervisor:

The Internet and the social media communities it encompasses can be incredible resources. They offer both a remarkably robust amount of historical material and an incredible amount of real-time reporting from people at the scenes of breaking news events. But they also present new and unfamiliar challenges, and they tend to amplify the effects of any ethical misjudgments you might make. So tread carefully. Conduct yourself online just as you would in any other public circumstances as an NPR journalist. Treat those you encounter online with fairness, honesty and respect, just as you would offline. Verify information before passing it along. Be honest about your intent when reporting. Avoid actions that might discredit your professional impartiality. And always remember, you represent NPR.

i toggle caption Sony Pictures Television Sony Pictures Television

Visiting the set of a historical drama can be a surreal experience, and Underground was no exception.

As the Louisiana sun beat down on an actual historical plantation near Baton Rouge last July, director Kate Woods oversaw a scene where an adorable small boy  actor Maceo Smedley  is picking cotton.

""Could someone go and put more blood on his hands?"" she shouted.

The second the filming stopped, someone dashed over with an umbrella to protect the 8-year-old from the stultifying heat, while the extras playing female field workers pulled bottles of Gatorade and cellphones from their 18th-century skirts.

Underground premieres on the basic cable channel WGN America tonight. It's the first major scripted drama taking the Underground Railroad as a setting. Enslaved people in the American South journeyed hundreds of miles to freedom, assisted by abolitionists, black and white. Given the drama of the actual history, it's almost hard to believe the Underground Railroad hasn't been a setting for a TV show before. (As it happens, NBC also planned a miniseries, called Freedom Run, last year, but it didn't pan out.)

Co-creators Misha Green and Joe Pokaski met while working as writers for the series Heroes, which ran for four seasons on NBC. It was Green's idea to draw on their shared love of comic books and action movies for a show that in some ways would be more 24 than Roots. They wanted to make it exciting and high-stakes, real and relevant.

i toggle caption Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television

Underground is, in the manner of Game of Thrones, a multilayered drama following different groups. Here: slave catchers, abolitionists, a plantation family in Georgia, the enslaved people forced to work there, and those who try to escape. Among them, a housemaid played by actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell. She compares Underground to spy thrillers where characters must rely on cryptic clues to make their way to freedom.

""They could use a star or they could use a song, or they could use code words or glances or markings on a tree,"" she says. The song ""Follow the Drinking Gourd,"" for example, is said to contain coded messages about navigating north by using the Big Dipper.

Other TV shows have dramatized American slavery  but not many. And such shows tend to be miniseries, not regularly scheduled dramas that could air for years. The great Roots, from 1977, was a miniseries. So was BET's critically acclaimed The Book of Negroes, from 2015. (Roots is scheduled for a remake this year.) The PBS series Mercy Street, which debuted this year, is set during the Civil War.

""But slavery is folded within it and not at all its center,"" writes Lisa Woolfork, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies representations of American slavery.

Woolfork says she's heard complaints about ""slavery fatigue"" since the success of high-profile movies such as 12 Years a Slave and Django Unchained. Writers Kara Brown in Jezebel and Demetria Lucas D'Oyley in The Root both recently wrote about it. Woolfork says she wholeheartedly understands wanting to put a shameful past behind us.

""We want to have it safely away so it doesn't impede on our everyday life,"" Woolfork says. ""But one way to understand why our present is the way it is, is rooted in the past. As Faulkner said, 'The past is never dead. It isn't even past.' ""

i toggle caption Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television

I hadn't yet talked to Woolfork when lead actor Aldis Hodge and production designer Meghan Rogers took me to Undeground's reconstructed slave quarters outside the Rural Life Museum at Louisiana State University  another exterior set. Seven wooden shacks were arranged around a vegetable garden, all authentic slave cabins from the 1830s that had been moved from another location.

""This was creepy sometimes,"" Rogers admitted.

""Very creepy,"" Hodge agreed. ""The first time on set, all of us, we didn't know where to step, we didn't know how to act, we didn't want to touch anything. You could feel the presence.""

Hodge says that sense of authenticity helped when he had to play very difficult scenes as the leader of the resistance. On one of the first days of shooting, he said, his character had to beg for his life on his knees after being caught.

""Those are the hard days,"" he said. ""It hurts, and there's no way you can come from set without taking a little piece of that with you.""

Filming Underground wasn't just emotionally draining for the actors. It was physically challenging. When Rogers created the set for the abolitionists' house, she built a secret passageways and a bunker where actors playing runaways had to crouch for hours.

""We play a lot of action of people standing on top of people hiding,"" she said. ""You could see a slave catcher standing right on top of someone.""

The production designer was incredibly attentive to tiny details and nuances. For example, she designed the dresses of the plantation housemaids to nearly fade into the wallpaper of the big house, so the women are almost like furniture. And she made the color yellow a motif  the color of freedom. It's the color of a ribbon carried by a runaway, and the color of the lanterns set in the window of the abolitionists' house as a signal.

""Throughout the entire show. I had somebody putting yellow flowers all over the place when they're on their journey,"" Rogers said. ""It's echoing the color of the lantern, the light of the lantern.""

It's fair to say that nothing in Underground is sepia-toned. The music is contemporary, and so is much of the language. Co-creator Misha Green said she aimed to pull American history off the wall of the proverbial museum.

""The Underground Railroad was the first integrated civil rights movement,"" she said. ""And it's a great example of when we work together, what we can go against. Which is 600 miles of crazy terrain being chased by slave catchers to get people to be what they should be in the first case  which is free.""",[]

To avoid any mistaken impressions about who was in charge, geographic and historic references to prisoner of war camps, concentration camps and death camps must be carefully worded. For instance, during WWII, the Japanese military held prisoners in the Philippines. Do not simply say they were Philippine prisoner of war camps. They were Japanese-run prisoner of war camps in the Philippines. Likewise, Auschwitz was not a Polish death camp. It was a Nazi- (or German) death camp in Poland.

In late 2014, Apple settled a class-action lawsuit over e-book pricing that had been brought by consumers and 33 U.S. states, but the payments in that case were predicated upon the outcome of Apple's appeal of the federal antitrust case. Today's rejection by the Supreme Court triggers Apple's payment of some $400 million to people who bought e-books.

""Most e-book purchasers will receive reimbursement for the higher prices Apple's conduct caused them to pay through automatic credits at their e-book retailers,"" the Justice Department says. ""They will be able to apply these credits to future purchases.""

The case's roots date back at least six years, when Apple sold its first iPad models and sought to compete with books giant Amazon as well as Barnes and Noble (both companies had already released their own e-book devices). Apple also launched an e-book marketplace for the iPad  and it was found to have conspired with five large book publishers to set prices that were higher than Amazon's.

Back in 2013, NPR reported that Apple's CEO Steve Jobs had been found to have sent an email to News Corp. executive James Murdoch, urging the participation of News Corp. property HarperCollins, including this line: ""Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream ebooks market at $12.99 and $14.99.""",[]

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Thank you, Bill.

SAGAL: In just a minute, Bill Kurtis is nominated for a rhyme-time Emmy in our Listener Limerick challenge. If you'd like to play, give us a call 1-888-WAIT-WAIT. That's 1-888-924-8924. Right now panel, some more questions for you from the week's news. Bobcat, please listen to this interesting statement.

BILL KURTIS: Ms. Eisenstein, one question...

SAGAL: OK, it's not that interesting. What is interesting is the person who said it. Who asked his first question in 10 years?

BOBCAT GOLDTHWAIT: First question in 10 years.

SAGAL: Yeah.

ROXANNE ROBERTS: It happened in Washington.

GOLDTHWAIT: Yeah, that's not going to help me.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: For 10 years...

ADAM BURKE: He doesn't even know which Washington you mean.

GOLDTHWAIT: Yeah.

SAGAL: For 10 years, this guy's had a job with until recently eight other people. And they all ask questions. He never asks a question. He finally did it this week.

BURKE: And it's not anyone on ""The Voice.""

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: Is it a Supreme Court justice?

SAGAL: It is.

GOLDTHWAIT: Yeah, that's - I'm out.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: That's all you got? No, wait a minute. You don't know their names. It's not a question of...

GOLDTHWAIT: Yeah, yeah.

SAGAL: ...Remembering. You just don't know.

GOLDTHWAIT: You are startled by not my stupidity but my honesty.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Yeah, no, I think it's actually admirable.

GOLDTHWAIT: It's refreshing, yeah.

BURKE: Wait, did you just quote Donald Trump?

SAGAL: All right.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: So I'm going to have to - I'm going to have to throw it open. And I know both of you know.

BURKE: Yeah.

ROBERTS: Clarence Thomas.

SAGAL: Clarence Thomas.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: Clarence Thomas.

GOLDTHWAIT: Oh, I know him.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: No, you don't. Ten years almost to the day after he last asked a question in court, Justice Thomas spoke. And observers were amazed that the first thing to come out of his mouth wasn't, say, a cocktail frank he'd been choking on since 2006.

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: It sounds like a new hearing-aid battery.

SAGAL: You think?

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: He just didn't know what they were doing all this time.

(LAUGHTER)

BURKE: It was so weird. Today at work was so weird. These guys came in...

GOLDTHWAIT: They were all talking and yammering.

SAGAL: I don't want to say anything because I'm embarrassed I can't hear. Here, I'll just sign this order banning abortion - fine.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Roxanne, this week, there was a milestone in the development of driverless car technology. For the first time, a driverless car did what?

ROBERTS: It got into a fender-bender.

SAGAL: It did.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: It caused an accident...

ROBERTS: Yes.

SAGAL: ...Which has never happened before. Driverless cars have been in accidents before, but it's never been their fault. The blame was always on driver-full car. In this incident, a Google car changed lanes suddenly, went right into a bus. Then, as its programming dictated, it pretended to have whiplash.

(LAUGHTER)

ROBERTS: It was going 2 miles an hour. How could they even tell?

BURKE: Even more impressive, that car blew a 2.1 blood-alcohol content.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Yes.

GOLDTHWAIT: But there's been other driverless cars. They just didn't have computers in them.

SAGAL: That's true.

(LAUGHTER)

GOLDTHWAIT: I grew up with many driverless cars.

SAGAL: Sure.

GOLDTHWAIT: We - our driveway was on a slant.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: You were a technological genius before your time.

BURKE: Yeah.

GOLDTHWAIT: I'm telling you just - you know, after a couple of pops, my dad didn't always put it in park.

SAGAL: Safe, yeah.

GOLDTHWAIT: We invented the driverless car.

Bernie Sanders was the story of Tuesday night as he beat Hillary Clinton in Michigan's Democratic presidential primary. It wasn't a walloping  he won by less than 2 points  but still a big coup considering Clinton led in most polls by double digits before the race.

Michigan is Sanders' ninth state win, though Clinton still leads in delegates overall.

That means Sanders is only partway up a steep hill to the nomination.

""I am used to climbing steep hills,"" Sanders told NPR's Ari Shapiro, host of All Things Considered, noting that when he began his campaign he was unknown to most Americans. ""Stay tuned. I think we are going to go further and we have a good chance to pull off the biggest political upset in the modern history of America. We can win this thing.""

As far as the delegate count so far goes, he admits, ""We have not done well in the deep South,"" but adds that ""it's not surprising. The South is a pretty conservative area, I'm not a conservative.""

But he points out the wins he has had in New England, the Midwest and West. Given those, he said, he thinks he has a ""pretty good chance"" to win in New York and an ""excellent chance"" in California, Oregon, Hawaii and smaller states like Montana and Idaho.

However, an NPR analysis found that even if on Tuesday, Sanders wins 55 percent of the delegates in Florida, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio, but Clinton wins 60 percent in North Carolina, Sanders would slip further behind, needing 54 percent of all remaining delegates.

After next week, even if Sanders wins four large, non-Southern contests (Wisconsin, Oregon, Washington and California) with 60 percent, he would still need to pick up 51 percent of the delegates from all remaining contests to win a majority of pledged delegates.

And there's another challenge ahead of him. He won Michigan largely thanks to white voters, but has struggled to appeal to African-Americans. He won a larger share of black votes in Michigan than he had been winning, but still not a majority  just around 30 percent.

The real hurdle, he says, is getting his message out to black voters  in a way that Hillary Clinton hasn't already.

""I don't think it's a question of us winning over black voters, I think it is a question of Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton having very strong support in the African-American community,"" he said. ""I congratulate them.""

Sanders also responded to his comment in the last debate that drew ire from some black leaders (""When you're white, you don't know what it's like to be living in a ghetto""), emphasizing his track record on poverty.

""There's no candidate who has talked more about poverty in this country than I have. White poverty, black poverty and Latino poverty,"" he said. ""Now it would be nice if every once in a while the media paid attention to those issues, which we don't.""",[]

But, being a pioneer story, it isn't a smooth journey. In Minnesota, the family is held up by mud from rains, and it takes the opportunity to trade its tired horses for a pair of mustangs. In Kansas, those same mustangs struggle to swim the family's covered wagon across a deep creek, and Pa has to dive in to guide them to the other side. More adventures await after the Ingalls settle on the Plains  from building a house to meeting the neighbors to fighting off fevers and dealing with Indians.

I remember that reading this book as a kid, I was struck by how tough 19th century life was. But now I'm more impressed by the story's grown-ups.

We wrote about this last month. The New York Times public editor weighed in this week. Its worth repeating:

When politicians and public officials (or anyone, for that matter) say things that dont fit the facts, we should point it out  and we are, as the Break It Down fact-checks show.

Our earlier post suggested several ways to say and write that what Candidate A or City Official B just said doesnt stand up to scrutiny. The Times Margaret Sullivan pointed to other approaches, such as noting that they spoke without citing any evidence or that the statement has no basis in fact.

If the evidence shows that a claim clearly doesnt add up, we dont need to qualify with a critics contend or a some say. State what is known and how weve reached that conclusion (for example, an NPR search of news accounts and police records found no evidence to support the claim).

Sullivan also noted something we agree with: that as much as possible, the fact-checking should be done in real time. That is, as soon as possible after a claim is made. Weve been doing that very effectively after the presidential debates and notable claims by candidates.

Obviously, politicians and public officials arent the only people who make claims that cant be substantiated. Keep in mind that, as the Ethics Handbook says, our purpose is to pursue the truth. Diligent verification is critical. We take great care to ensure that statements of fact in our journalism are both correct and in context. Also, we shouldnt just spread information.

Late Thursday evening, Kendrick Lamar crept back into our lives like a thief in the night. With his new album untitled unmastered., Lamar and his label Top Dawg Entertainment offer us a look at the steps it took to get to his fully formed magnum opus  2015's To Pimp A Butterfly  and show us that they can stop the world when they feel like it.

Officially deemed a collection of ""demos,"" the raw tracks are nameless and featureless, identified only by the date they were presumably recorded. Up until now, Lamar had only given a few hints that this music existed. He performed one song on The Tonight Show just this January, part of another on the Grammys even more recently, and another on the Colbert Report in 2014. ""Untitled 03,"" the song from his Colbert appearance, was recorded more than a year and a half before he performed it. We're listening to Lamar's past in the present here. It feels like we're playing catch-up.

The project shows us demos within demos, with parts of one song appearing on another song  sometimes recorded years apart. One of the more forward-thinking tracks is called ""Untitled 07"": It feels and sounds like Lamar is shaking off flakes of the old him and growing a new skin by the minute. In that song and others, we get a direct line into Kendrick Lamar's experimentation with using his voice as an instrument. We hear him strain and yell and whisper his way through his own evolution.

untitled. unmastered. is both the fire and ashes from which To Pimp A Butterfly rose. As I listen, the only thought running through my mind is: What does the material Kendrick Lamar recorded yesterday sound like? And when will we be ready for it?",[]

i ImageZoo/Corbis ImageZoo/Corbis

When she was 17, Tracey Helton Mitchell was prescribed an opioid pain killer after getting her wisdom teeth extracted. The medicine helped her deal with the pain related to the extraction, but when the prescription ran out, her desire for its euphoric high remained. That's when she turned to heroin.

As a teenager, Mitchell imagined heroin to be glamorous, but she found it wasn't once she became an addict. She tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that the drug ruined her health and her self-esteem. She lived in an alley, shot drugs into the bottom of her feet, sold her body for money and was jailed several times. She was also featured in a 1999 documentary about addicts called Black Tar Heroin.

At one of her lowest points, Mitchell says, ""I was having heart palpitations, because I was using stimulants, and I thought, 'They're going to pull me out of this hotel, I have no ID, my parents, my family ... will never know that I died and I'll just be a Jane Doe and this is how I'm going to expire in this place.' ""

But Mitchell didn't die from her addiction. Rather, with the help of the nondenominational 12-step program LifeRing and other support groups and therapies, she eventually stopped using and became a certified addiction specialist. She has been clean for 18 years.

In her new memoir, The Big Fix, Mitchell writes about her addiction and her path to recovery, and also shares insights into today's heroin epidemic. When it comes to our current treatment system, Mitchell says we would do better to reach out to addicts as individuals, by recognizing each user's unique needs and motivations.

Our current method of treatment is ""sort of a one-size-[fits]-all approach,"" she says. ""We need to have a variety of different kinds of treatment interventions that address people's needs.""

Interview Highlights

On what it's like to watch Black Tar Heroin now that she's clean

It can be painful to watch, especially when I think about my life now and I contrast that. ... My legs did look like I was dropped in a dumpster and picked out by rats. I had, I think, 34 or 36 abscesses. I have scars that have healed, but I had to have surgeries on some and in the summertime when everybody else is wearing shorts and stuff like that, I see those things  even right now sitting here at the table I can see one of the scars on my arms. It's a good thing in that it reminds me of where I was, but then it's also very challenging, because this documents a very unpleasant part of my life that can't be changed.

On why she agreed to be filmed

I really believed that I was going to die, or be murdered. There was lots of evidence to make me feel that way, and I wanted it to be something that people would see after I was dead that showed that heroin was not the glamorous thing that I had thought it was when I was a teenager and had imagined it. I wasn't paid for the film; it was a huge inconvenience in my life, but I feel like it still is sort of my legacy to the world, because it's something that's watched today. Millions of people still watch it.

On black tar heroin in the '90s versus heroin today

There's still tar heroin. The heroin that most people get today is much, much stronger. We didn't have to worry about fentanyl  of us dropping dead from an overdose, because no one cut it with fentanyl. The thing that we really worried about was getting flesh-eating [bacteria, necrotizing fasciitis] ... or getting some kind of wound botulism or getting abscesses. There certainly were overdoses then. You could get arrested for overdosing and a lot of people were rolled out at the hospitals or left outside to die ... but there wasn't this culture of heroin where heroin is prevalent absolutely everywhere. It was more localized to big cities, more urban areas.

On 'hitting bottom'

i toggle caption Michael Kerner Photography/Seal Press Michael Kerner Photography/Seal Press

I don't believe in the concept of a bottom. I think that if the opposite of addiction is connection, that addicts or people who use drugs are really seeking out  they need some kind of connection with people. And I would say I've had a wide variety of bottoms, but I wasn't ready to stop until I started to believe that there was a possibility that I actually could stop and saw reasons for myself to stop, and my motivation is totally different.

On being ready to get clean

One of the myths about addiction is that you come to this incredible moment of clarity and that you decide that you're going to stop. And so over the course of my using I had various moments of clarity and I had various points where I had wanted to stop, but they were not always congruent with my opportunities.

So there [were] very few opportunities where I really could truly try to stop, but I would stop using for a few days, I'd try to kick on my own, I'd switch to different drugs, I'd move to different places. I tried different things to stop, but I wasn't completely ready, because all these different traumas had accumulated in my life, and I wasn't prepared to deal with the emotional consequences of all these different things. And that's what to me being off drugs meant  was that I would have to then figure out how I was going to fix all these things on my own. And it wasn't until I got an idea that maybe other people would help me, talking to my mother, knowing that I would have some kind of emotional support where I'd start seeing [that] maybe I don't have to totally do all of this on my own.

On needle exchange programs

At the time there was no needle exchange at all [in Cincinnati] and so you would use the same syringe over and over again and hopefully it didn't break off in your arm. Until the numbers wore off of it, you would sharpen it on a matchbook, and it was just horrible; it was like a rusty nail sticking in your arm.

So I came to San Francisco and they had needle exchanges, which was a revelation, because so many people in the country were suffering from HIV and AIDS, particularly AIDS, because there was no anti-retrovirals. ... So the syringe exchange people provided me education about my drug use. ...

I've seen in my life so many examples of where not having a clean syringe never stopped anyone. I've seen people pick them up out of the gutters. Even here in San Francisco, where there's a lot of access, people break open sharps containers that they've stolen from hospitals because they needed a syringe and they don't have one. ... It doesn't stop people. All it does is spread a public health crisis.

On harm reduction and the argument that harm reduction enables users

My answer is, you can't get clean if you're dead, so there has to be harm reduction. We're not encouraging people to do anything, we're taking a look at their public health behaviors and then addressing what the particular needs are, so look at the cost of one syringe versus the cost of someone getting hepatitis C and having to take care of them for a lifetime.

Look at the public health cost of various other medical conditions that a person can have. From not using sterile water or alcohol pads, someone having endocarditis or some other infection, so having a safe system for people to take care of themselves and treating addicts, users not just addicts, there's plenty of people who use who are not necessarily considered on the spectrum of drug addicts, treating people humanely and having them have access to public health services and the things that they need.

On coping with depression since becoming clean

Part of the reason why I wanted to write The Big Fix is because I felt like there's no ... real education on long-term recovery about what really happens over time. So dealing with topics like untreated depression and anxiety and all the other kind of things that you go through when you take the drugs away, and then you have new issues, because before you use drugs, you didn't have all these guilty, shameful things that you ... now have to deal with, if you're a person like me and you get off drugs.

So I've had a very complicated relationship with my emotions in the past 18 years that I've been clean. I've dealt with very serious post-traumatic stress disorder, being very checked out and dissociative at various points, having to deal with the constant specter of depression, every once in a while having suicidal thoughts. And one of the things that I try to do is really normalize those feelings when people want to know what recovery is really like. It's like, some days you really feel crappy. You really have some things that are going on with you, and I think the prevalent idea is that you get clean and everything is supposed to be great. ... You can have a great life and still not feel all that great.",[]

Crusty editors arent the only ones who extol the merits of precision writing and editing.

Heres what comedian Hasan Minaj had to say about Jon Stewart during Elizabeth Blairs piece on Morning Edition today:

Hes always been really great about cutting. ... Because we only have 22 minutes to convey a lot and in a field piece you only have 4 1/2, 5 minutes, maybe 6 minutes tops. ... Cutting out extraneous stuff, even if its extra laughs. ... Cutting those things out to convey the story and to convey the narrative and the argument. And youll still get great jokes in there. But once you really establish and lay that groundwork out, thats where it goes to that next level.

i Katherine Du/NPR Katherine Du/NPR

Serekalem Alemu is crocheting a basket.

Wearing a grey fleece jacket and a long grey skirt speckled with blue flowers, Alemu sits on a sofa on the second floor of a former warehouse in the industrial section of Tel Aviv. A damp Mediterranean winter breeze blows in through the open window. Traffic whizzes by on the boulevard below. With her thick black hair held back in a ponytail, the 28-year-old winds long, narrow strips of teal-colored fabric into a ball, which will eventually become a basket.

When she's finished  it takes her about three hours to make a basket about 10 inches in diameter  her handiwork will go on sale for $25 in a boutique. She'll keep half of that and the rest goes to keep the program going.

But for Alemu, the basket isn't just about earning some money. It's therapy. It makes her feel better. And she has a lot of reasons to feel bad.

Alemu is one of 43,000 African asylum-seekers, mainly from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan, who traveled by foot and vehicle many hundreds of miles to reach Israel. They're part of the largest global wave of asylum seekers since World War II.

Many of these migrants suffer along the way. Alemu says she was tortured by her smugglers but will not elaborate. When she reached Israel in 2011, she fell into depression and was hospitalized twice in a psychiatric ward.

Other migrant women have reported rape and human trafficking, saying they are passed from one group of smugglers to another, who torture them until they pay large sums of money for their freedom. They often ask family members or friends abroad to send the money. Humanitarian aid groups estimate that some 4,000 to 6,000 of the Africans who've made it to Israel have been victimized.

But when they were offered the chance to talk with a therapist in Israel, it didn't work.

""I soon realized that wasn't an appropriate approach,"" says psychologist Diddy Mymin Kahn, who has worked as a therapist for the Tel Aviv African Refugee Development Center.

Women often didn't show up for their appointments. Those who did would not share their stories, says Kahn.

So she teamed up with an art therapist to found the Kuchinate African Women's Collective, funded by grants and donations from organizations and individuals. Sister Azezet Kidane, a Roman Catholic nun from Eritrea and a registered nurse, soon joined to help develop the program.

Kuchinate means ""crochet"" in Tigrigna, an Eritrean language, and that's what the participants do. There are 40 members of the collectives. Twice a week, many of these female asylum seekers come to the refurbished Tel Aviv warehouse to crochet baskets, using long strips of colorful polyester fabric. Back home, they used to weave baskets from the flexible fronds of the doum species of palm tree, but the tree is rare in Israel.

There's something about the experience of crocheting that encourages them to open up.

As they make the baskets, they talk about dealing with the stress and trauma of their migration as well as the uncertainty of life in Israel. Most of them currently live without any official status or rights until a government policy is established for the asylum seekers.

""Many of them are traumatized when they come here, but this group gives them strength to bring it out, to talk about it,"" says Kidane. ""It's a process of healing.""

She and Kahn sit and talk to the women while they crochet, sometimes steering conversation to topics like how to handle stress or traumatic memories. When one participant shares her difficulties or feelings, others speak up, either telling the group or going into a side room to speak privately with Kidane and Kahn.

""Our people, they don't do counseling one-on-one, you need a group, a circle,"" Kidane said. ""Many of the asylum-seekers were raped, and they often keep it secret because they think it's only them and they are ashamed. But here they meet other people with the same experiences and feel, oh, I am not alone.""

""It's a major crisis,"" said Kim Yuval, coordinator of psychotherapy at Physicians for Human Rights, who has also studied the prevalence of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder among asylum seekers as part of his doctoral research at the University of Haifa. ""Many people are resilient, but as a community the situation is very bad, and it's important that we deal with these problems."" In one study involving 116 Sudanese asylum-seekers in Tel Aviv, Yuval found that 60 percent suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, and roughly a quarter suffer from depression.

These problems are not isolated to those from Sudan or those in Israel, Yuval said, but are seen among asylum-seekers globally.

""When I am at home I cry all day,"" said 31-year-old Lula Gebrekidan, who left Eritrea five years ago hoping to eventually pave the way for her three daughters and husband, who is currently jailed for political opposition to the regime there. ""When I am here, I don't cry. I talk to others.""

Her eyes swell with tears as she describes scenes she witnessed in the two weeks she spent in the Sinai, where she paid a smuggler $3,000 to drive her to the Israeli border.

""I saw rape, a woman who had sex with six men all right after each other. I also saw a 5-year-old boy buried in the dirt up to his neck, with men throwing rocks at his head until his family would pay more money to their smugglers,"" Gebrekidan said. ""Talking about it brings some relief.""

She said she was only able to talk about her experiences after hearing similar stories from others. ""At home it is forbidden to discuss things like this,"" Gebrekidan said.

Kahn and Kidane say that many of the women here need help beyond this program, but this is a start to pulling them out of depression and assessing their needs.

""They see, ah, I am still alive, I am still capable,"" Kidane said. ""For them it is a door opening.""

The room is lined with floor-to-ceiling shelves, full of hundreds of baskets made by these women. In the corner of the studio, Gebrekidan roasts cardamom-scented coffee beans over hot coals in a metal box. The studio's kitchenette is equipped with electric burners, but she prefers to make coffee in this traditional way, the aromatic steam and smoke from the smoldering coals floating out the nearby open window. She is preparing the coffee for a group of Israeli mothers from a suburban Tel Aviv school who will soon arrive for a crochet workshop taught by the women of the collective.

For a couple of hours the asylum-seekers teach the Israelis how to crochet, then serve them Gebrekidan's coffee along with injera, a flat sourdough bread common in Eritrea and Ethiopia, and dips made of lentils and chickpeas. The mothers leave, most of them with baskets they purchased. The African women again gather in a circle of chairs and continue making more baskets and talking.

For Alemu, the two days a week when she comes here are critical.

""I still have a problem in my head,"" she said. ""But my head is better here.""",[]

One of the long-standing tenets of rap bravado is truth-telling. For an MC to be deemed ""real,"" the stories he pens must be more than mere stories; they must be rooted in fact. Rap has often viewed verses as a house of mirrors, always reflecting one's reality even if, at times, the image is distorted. Saint Paul, Minnesota's Allan Kingdom isn't one for convention; he's a nonconformist and a stylist with malleable, half-sung flows, but he too subscribes to this particular principle. As a decidedly Bohemian, free-thinker type, his message is often clear: Be yourself and be honest about it.

toggle caption courtesy of the artist

His recent mixtape, Northern Lights, explores this sentiment in many hues, seemingly taking sonic cues from the cosmos. Yet its anchor, ""Fables"", is an ominous, prowling tune less concerned with the Aesop variety, than with the complete obfuscation of truth. Over heavy, plodding electric piano keys and swirling, disembodied vocals that pass through the track like apparitions, Kingdom delivers straight talk about being true to oneself.He creeps through some cadences and stretches others, using one of the oldest parables to help paint his picture: ""Cain and Abel since the cradle/ Couldn't hate or hurt my bro/ In a maze with all your tales/ I don't know which way to go."" The voices wisp in and out as the air grows still around him.

The turning point in ""Fables"" is the spellbinding third verse, performed dutifully by reggae singer Chronixx with a resonant tone that's almost built for carving out echoes in this cavernous setting. His presence is more fleshed out than Kingdom's, and the contrast adds depth and perspective, providing small insights into being forthcoming: ""Call a spade a spade and throw your cards on the table,"" he sings, swelling into a crescendo. But it is still the shape-shifting Kingdom who drives the point home with his own self-awareness: ""Don't tell no fables, now I'm able/ I know, can't hit every note/ Yeah I know, but hit that feeling that be deep up in your soul."" He seems to understand what many don't: the realness that makes the greatest impact is the absolute kind, a willingness to bare one's most intimate self, even when the effect is raw and not necessarily positive.

For many writers, the migrant's journey is a storytellers' dream. The transition from one part of the world to another is filled with anticipation, conflict and inherent literary drama. While trains and planes become the mundane means of transportation for most travelers, those trips can herald life-changing transformations for a migrant remaking his or her life through that journey.

Novelist Amitav Ghosh is finishing an epic trilogy of novels  Sea of Poppies, River of Smoke, Flood of Fire  set at sea in the midst of the Opium Wars of the 19th century. They're filled with countless characters from around the world navigating the stormy seas in search of better lives.

The novels examine questions of empire, power and class, but the real star of Ghosh's books is an old-fashioned sailing ship named the Ibis. The former slave ship begins its journey in Baltimore and sails around Africa, onto India and China after it's bought by a British merchant living in Calcutta. As the Ibis docks in ports around the world, a global cast of characters assembles on board  which allows Ghosh to craft a kaleidoscopic portrait of characters.

""The journeys of the people who've come there are themselves so interesting,"" Ghosh says. ""What brings people into this very enclosed space  people with such different histories and experiences  all of that creates endless possibilities."" Beyond the literary possibilities, Ghosh says that convergence of identities echoes the way modern migration has brought so many people together.

""Every ship was in a sense a microcosm of the world,"" says Ghosh, who was inspired by Herman Melville's Moby Dick. ""This is one of Melville's great themes ... how completely different kinds of people are thrust together and how very often their roles just completely change.""

Change is also at the heart of Yann Martel's best-selling novel Life of Pi and its Oscar-winning film adaptation. An Indian boy sailing to Canada with his family survives a shipwreck. He's lost at sea on a lifeboat with a tiger. They must learn to coexist, and they forge a community of survivors.

""The notion of shipwreck in the Life of Pi I think is a perfect metaphor for the experience of exile,"" says Reza Aslan, a best-selling author and editor of the anthology Tablet and Pen. ""Being adrift, looking for a land to call home, that's an experience that I myself have experienced as an exile from Iran,"" he says.

Aslan says Life of Pi shows how the immigrant's journey leaves an individual unmoored  how it throws an identity into flux.

The idea of how immigrants reconcile their past with the future inspired Jhumpa Lahiri's novel The Namesake, which also became a film. In it, a father survives a traumatic train accident as a young man in India.

""We have to go through that darkness, through that chaos and confusion, in order to ... ultimately figure out that the person we are today still has fragments of the person we were before we immigrated,"" says Ilan Stavans, professor of literature at Amherst College and editor of the anthology Becoming Americans. ""What immigrant writers have done in American literature is shown us that America is a microcosm of the world  that all cultures converge here  that we have connections, tentacles to the rest of the world, and that we are a society in constant movement.""

That movement is very much in the headlines today, and it was the subject of Sonia Nazario's Pulitzer Prize-winning Enrique's Journey. Nazario followed a young boy from Honduras searching for his mother in the United States.

""He travels the only way that he can  with little or no money  which is gripping onto the tops and the sides of these freight trains that travel up the length of Mexico. It's a modern-day odyssey that these children go on.""

It's a book of reporting written with a novelist's eye. ""There were gangsters that controlled the train tops,"" Nazario says. ""I would see these guys  they would roam from car to car and surround a group of migrants and say, 'Your money, or your life'  and strip you of your clothes, look for any coins they can find, and sometimes hurdle you down to the churning wheels below.""

Reza Aslan says part of what's fueling the stories of migration are a new generation of writers with roots in multiple parts of the world. ""When you have these writers who have these hyphenated identities,"" he says, ""they have the ability ... to draw from those cultures and to really get at the heart of what literature is about  how we as human beings navigate an indeterminate world; how we understand our place in this planet.""

And ultimately these stories of migration aren't really about the external journey. ""It doesn't matter the mode of transportation  whether by foot or by camel or by car or by plane,"" says Aslan. ""It doesn't matter the destination, and even the journey itself is secondary to the transformation that occurs in the individual making the journey.""

And even for the individual sitting still, reading about those journeys can become its own means of transformation.",[]

When James Corden took over The Late Late Show one year ago, the question on everyone's mind was, ""James who?""

He was big in the U.K. In the U.S. he had starred in the movie Into the Woods and won a Tony for the play One Man, Two Guvnors on Broadway. But beyond that, he was relatively unknown.

So it's kind of unreal that after just one year in the chair, his show has broken records for people watching on YouTube.

That's mostly thanks to a segment called ""Carpool Karaoke."" Corden drives along with celebrities, just the two of them  in a car with a few mounted cameras  singing along to the stereo.

The Late Late Show with James Corden YouTube

The video he made with Adele has been viewed more than 80 million times. He has also done Carpool Karaoke with about a dozen other pop stars, including Justin Bieber and Elton John. The Wall Street Journal called it one of the most successful YouTube franchises of all time.

My producer and I met Corden at his office on the CBS lot in LA where he films The Late Late Show. ""All right, let's light a candle, shall we?"" said Corden. ""Three open-minded, broad-minded guys kicking back with a candle, right?"" The candle has a masculine scent, like leather-bound books. Corden's T-shirt exposes his new temporary tattoo: Cookie Monster, courtesy of his young son.

Corden told me the idea for Carpool Karaoke came out of a segment he filmed with George Michael for a charity back in the U.K., but he couldn't get anybody in the U.S. to sing along.

Finally, he tried Mariah Carey. ""It was a chance meeting with a lady at Mariah Carey's record company, who was here in our office, actually,"" he said. ""And I pulled her in here, to this very office that we're sitting in now, and I played her the clip of George Michael singing, and I was like, it's joyful. And that's what people want, you want to see the joy in people, and you want to see the person that always dreamt of being a star, you know? You want to see people having a great time. So Mariah Carey is a huge fan of George Michael, she said 'if George will do it, I'll do it, let's do it on Sunday!' ""

On the reaction to the first Carpool Karaoke

The second person we did it with was Jennifer Hudson, and that went through the roof. And then there's just been a couple of moments where  we did the one with Justin Bieber, which kind of went crazy, and I think is at 65 million views on YouTube right now. Both Justin and his manager were like, ""that's me. That's the real me in that car, that's me who you're seeing on TV.""

The Late Late Show with James Corden YouTube

On whether Carpool Karaoke serves as a kind of image rehab for some stars

Sometimes you can have a reputation for not being relatable and nice because you had a bad day once. That's the thing. And I think that's particularly pertinent with Justin, because you just forget how young he is. When he gets in a car with me and I feel that about him  and I don't ever want to make a show which is snarky or trying to do someone over, or trying to make it about me, somehow. All I want is our guests to shine, because if our guests shine, our show shines, and if our show shines, then I shine. I don't ever want to come out and make anything about me ... and the whole thing is a collaboration, those carpools.

On whether he dreamed, as a child, of being a pop or theater star

Of course! To be honest, all I wanted to do, all I ever, ever wanted to do, I just wanted to perform. I just wanted to perform in whatever capacity, whether it was acting, singing, dancing, comedy  whatever it was, I just loved it and felt at my absolute happiest when I was performing for people. And if that's what you want from a job, then this is the best job you could ever do.",[]

i toggle caption Theo Wargo/Getty Images Theo Wargo/Getty Images

On Friday night, I finally got to see Hamilton, the critically acclaimed musical I've been surprisingly obsessed with since Frannie Kelley's glowing write-up of the cast album last fall.

I say ""surprising"" because I am not a fan of musical theater, the kind of not-a-fan-of-musical-theater who pointedly self-describes as such should musical theater come up in conversation. But there I was, gripping my seat, as Leslie Odom Jr., the virtuoso who plays Aaron Burr, stood onstage by his lonesome in ""Wait For It,"" my favorite song in a show lousy with fantastic songs.

That number, all about frustrations and ambition and jealousy and doubt, knocked me on my ass the first time I heard it on the album,  like, wtf, do I actually like musicals now?  and the live experience was equally overwhelming. I'd read somewhere that Odom and other cast members regularly focus their attentions on particular audience members while performing, and I'm 95 percent sure that Odom was looking dead at me in the sixth row, as I mouthed along all the words to his song. Just two Philly dudes separated by a few dozen feet and a gaping chasm of musical ability sharing this moment of real connection.

I told my colleague/friend Stephen Thompson, who was with me that night, about this during intermission, and he joked that it was probably because Odom and I seemed to be the only black guys in the theater that night. We laughed, but it was hard not to notice that while Hamilton has been hailed for deliberately casting actors of color as some of America's most venerated Dead White Men, and ""reclaiming the American story ... for the people whom history habitually forgets,"" the actors onstage seemed to make up the majority of brown people in the house the night I went.

This is of course an unscientific study, based on me craning my neck and looking around the room, but three other folks who've seen the show recently tell me the audience was overwhelmingly white when they went, too. Yesterday, I asked folks on Twitter who've seen the show to share their experience, and many of them told me the same thing.

I'm avoiding making a too-obvious ""Great White Way"" joke here, but it seems these observations track with Broadway audiences in general; according to The Broadway League, the trade association for the Broadway theater industry, nearly 8 in 10 people who saw Broadway shows in 2014-2015 were white and in their mid-40s. (That's more diverse and a decade younger than NPR's audience, for the record.) About 80 percent had college degrees and about 40 percent had graduate degrees.

Now, I'm not arguing that black and brown folks ""should"" go to Broadway shows, and there is, of course, lots of theater, far from Broadway, that caters to audiences of color. But it's worth asking why this ostensibly uber-POC-friendly phenomenon isn't consistently pulling a notably black and brown audience.

A bunch of folks in the Twitter conversation yesterday suggested that who goes to Broadway shows is a simple matter of dollars and cents. James McMaster at HowlRound recently made a similar assertion about Hamilton, which you pretty much can't see without parting with a couple of hundred bucks:

The exorbitantly high ticket prices coupled with the perpetually sold-out status of the production prohibit most working class people of color from attending the show. Given that the production's audience, then, is overwhelmingly white and upper-middle-class, one wonders about the reception of the show's racial performance. How many one-percenters walk away from Hamilton thinking that they are on the right side of history simply because they exchanged hundreds of dollars for the opportunity to sit through a racialized song and dance? My guess: too many.

This is a compelling argument, but then again, nearly half a million folks book flights and hotels and tickets for EssenceFest in New Orleans each year. Then there's the mad rush a few weeks back for tickets for Beyonce's surprise tour. That is to say, there's a whole lot of pricey entertainment that people of color are willing to drop serious dough on, but Broadway shows like Hamilton don't seem to rate. Money matters, of course, but it's not the whole story.

When it comes to race and Broadway audiences, a big part of the story seems to be acculturation. Theater has a long history of segregated seating and plays chock full of racist caricatures that meant black folks, in particular, never warmed to Broadway. ""Theatergoing on Broadway is supported by families who collected programs going back 50 or 80 years,"" James Hatch, the co-author of A History of African American Theatre, told WNYC in 2012. ""Blacks did not have that tradition, and apparently still don't.""

That plays out today in the important, subtle social cues about who belongs. It's hard enough getting comfortable in a social space when you're unfamiliar with its rules and conventions. It's even harder when you're aware of how much you stand out. At Broadway shows like Hamilton, you get the honor of having that experience for a few hundred dollars. Even as Hamilton exceeded my impossibly high expectations, I felt a vague unease sitting there that night, like I was at a hip-hop show where my favorite group was performing, but I might get shushed for rapping along too loudly. (But c'mon, y'all: HERCULES MULLIGAN!)

Not being a regular theatergoer or a Broadway vet meant I didn't know exactly how to be in the audience. I was unfamiliar enough with the ritual and customs of that space to be worried that I might be doing it wrong somehow. Could that disconnect be keeping folks who might shell out comparable cash for Bey, even if it means traveling to another city, from doing the same for Hamilton? Something I've been chewing on, and sound off on Twitter if you think I'm wildly off-base here.",[]

 The conversations start from this position: We report the news, good and bad.

 But we cant be callous. The video may show someones death. Out of respect for that person and that persons family, we consider carefully what should be shown or heard. Our general rule is that we do not post video or play audio of someones moment of death. There will be exceptions, but only after discussion.

 We also respect our audience. They want the facts. But for many, reading or hearing descriptions will be more than enough. Seeing or hearing disturbing events could leave them too shaken to follow the rest of a story.

 Every other news outlet else is using it is not on its own a justification for posting or broadcasting anything.

 Especially in the first minutes and hours after such content surfaces, its credibility may be in doubt. Proceed with caution.

 The content may be propaganda. For example, extremist groups spread their messages and try to spread terror by putting out videos of hostages being murdered. We do not blindly post or air propaganda. It would be highly unusual for us to even link to it.

Rigid rules about what to do wont work. Each situation is different. However:

 If its decided that videos with potentially disturbing content can be posted, they should never start automatically when a webpage loads. They must require a click to begin. They must either have a warning note embedded in them or it must appear directly above them.

 Likewise, on the air listeners should never hear potentially disturbing content without first being told that its coming. For instance, cellphone audio of gunshots that kill a man should not be heard until after a caution has been given.

 We should consider whether a videos disturbing moments and sounds can and should be blurred and bleeped, for posting online and using on the air.

 If the original content is too disturbing to post and we do not have a blurred/bleeped version that we are comfortable using, we may decide to link to another news outlets edited version if it is in line with our standards. We should caution readers that it includes potentially disturbing content. The language should be simple and clear. For example: The Daily Planet has posted a clip from the video here. Reminder: It is graphic.

 When a member station is chasing the same story, we should talk with the news director about how to handle the content. Often, well be in agreement and can link to the stations coverage.

But, But, But:

 Does this mean well never put such content online or on the air?

No. See above: We report the news, good and bad. We would not have edited a video of the Challenger explosion, for example, to blur the key moments.

 Are we treating the audience like children?

Some will say we are. We believe were making editorial judgments.

Note: The guidance above applies to images as well. We do not post potentially disturbing photos without first discussing.

i toggle caption Andi Harman/Courtesy of the artist Andi Harman/Courtesy of the artist

As one of the two guitarists and principal songwriters in the Denton, Texas, bands The Marked Men and Radioactivity, Mark Ryan indulges his gifts for heart-on-the-sleeve melodic punk and power-pop, respectively. But his band Mind Spiders seems to act as the warehouse in which Ryan stores his other obsessions: vaguely sci-fi-influenced, tightly wound, good-time rock 'n' roll, set off by dual drummers and the occasional synth. Mind Spiders' three albums prior to Prosthesis did little to deviate from this path, but technology has caught up with Ryan and his cohorts: Daniel Fried, Gregory Rutherford and Marked Men bandmate Mike Throneberry.

Prosthesis is Mind Spiders' darkest release yet, both in themes and atmosphere, and electronics feature more prominently in its eight songs than ever before. ""Cold,"" ""Ulcer"" and ""No Filter"" hit a particularly doomed note, but the synths and drum machine provide a presence rather than drive the proceedings; if anything, Mind Spiders uses them as pace-setting devices for the guitars and live drummer to outrun, in sprints of strident downpicking and on-the-beat hi-hat/snare work. Even ""Split In Two""  in which the digital tones create jarring tone clashes that bear a resemblance to Devo  also reflects the group's insistence on precision, a foil for the band to continue attacking the beat.

As for its dystopian concept, that's for Mind Spiders to explain, but it's telling that the group's most engaged record to date is also its most brooding. Prosthesis provides a modern soundtrack to the world inspired by the film Logan's Run, with Ryan and his bandmates seeking an escape and ultimately getting someplace worth going.",[]
npr.org,2016-03-08 00:00:00,'A Man Lies Dreaming' By Lavie Tidhar,[],"Unnerving WWII Noir In 'A Man Lies Dreaming'

Books that imagine a different version of the World War II era are as old as Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle and as new as Philip Roth's 2005 novel The Plot Against America. But few of these alternate histories are as bold and unnerving as Lavie Tidhar's A Man Lies Dreaming. First published in the UK in 2014, the novel is now out in the U.S., and it couldn't appear at a more unnerving time: As if mirroring our current election cycle, it depicts a right-wing politician successfully stoking the fires of xenophobia and bigotry. But in the case of Dreaming, the setting is London in 1939  in a world where the Nazis never rose to power in Germany, and the British Fascist leader Oswald Mosley is leading the race to become the new Prime Minister.

Oswald, however, is not the main character in Dreaming. Tidhar's choice is far more audacious: The book centers around Wolf, a down-and-out private eye in London who escaped Germany in 1933 when the communists  not the National Socialists  took over. It becomes clear very early on that Wolf is, in fact, Adolf Hitler.

Tidhar has handled reviled, real-life figures in his fiction before, most notably in 2011's Osama, and at first Dreaming feels like a reprise. Tidhar has other plans, though. The plot of Dreaming unfolds like a hardboiled detective yarn, with Wolf being hired by a mysterious  and Jewish  femme fatale to find her missing sister. At the same time, he takes on a second case for Oswald, whom he both admires and resents for capitalizing on the same anti-Semitic, nationalistic ideas that Wolf himself once spread. Wolf, at heart, is still the Hitler of our world, with the same virulent beliefs and lust for power: ""Give me a large enough lever and I would move the very world,"" he snarls in frustration, a would-be despot who was never given the chance to twist the world into his own image.

If that kind of alt-history speculation comprised the entirety of Dreaming, it'd be an intriguing read. But it's only the tip of Tidhar's iceberg. In a story that intersects Wolf's, a Jew named Shomer  hailing from our version of reality  is a prisoner at Auschwitz. He's also a writer of pulp detective stories. The interplay between the two storylines grows profound as they progress. Wolf's investigations take bizarre, grotesque, blackly comedic turns while Shomer's horrific existence grows symbolic  and then something magically more than symbolic  when the SS assigns him the task of making doors.

'Dreaming' is a book of big ideas, from the pathological origins of racist ideology to the way humanizing and dehumanizing those we love or loathe are flip sides of the same coin.

Like any good alt-history, Dreaming is exhaustively researched. A multitude of historical figures pop up in its pages, including many literary ones  among them A. A. Milne, J. R. R. Tolkien, Ian Fleming, and Evelyn Waugh. Some feel gratuitous and even distracting; others, like G. K. Chesterton and his notions of law and anarchy from The Man Who Was Thursday, feed into the thematic fabric that Tidhar weaves. Dreaming is a book of big ideas, from the pathological origins of racist ideology to the way humanizing and dehumanizing those we love or loathe are flip sides of the same coin.

Functionally, Hitler is the hero of Dreaming. Tidhar evokes a flesh-crawling sympathy for the most hated man in modern history while degrading him physically, emotionally, and sexually. He also paints a bloodcurdling picture of Auschwitz, where ""men die like smoke"" and ""women die like air."" Holocaust survivor Yehiel De-Nur  author of the infamously lurid House of Dolls  appears briefly as a character in the book, observing that ""this is an alien planet [...]. This is Planet Auschwitz."" A few pages earlier, Wolf is absurdly, hilariously envisioning how he might have brutally subjugated Oz if he'd been its dictator, all while grudgingly admitting to himself how much he loves ""Over the Rainbow.""

Tidhar tightropes between fantasy, farce, and historical fiction, all while grounding things in brisk, gritty noir. Parallels to our current state of affairs abound, but if anything, they're simply symptoms of how the past can recycle itself in frightening new ways  a process that Dreaming compellingly picks apart and rewires. History isn't written by the winners or the losers, Tidhar illustrates, but by those who know how to shroud it and spin it the most entertainingly. Which only makes Dreaming all the more chilling.

""The Native American wizarding community was particularly gifted in animal and plant magic, its potions in particular being of a sophistication beyond much that was known in Europe.""

That's what J.K. Rowling writes in the first of a four-part essay series, collectively called History of Magic in North America. ""The most glaring difference between magic practised by Native Americans and the wizards of Europe was the absence of a wand.""

It's just one tidbit from the essay titled ""Fourteenth Century  Seventeenth Century"" and published on the Pottermore website on Tuesday.

The writing is full of details to whet fans' appetites ahead of the November release of the Harry Potter spinoff film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Set in New York City in 1926, the movie documents the life of wizard Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne), who wrote the ""Fantastic Beasts"" textbook featured in the Harry Potter series.

For example, Rowling writes that ""while every nationality has its own term for 'Muggle,' the American community uses the slang term No-Maj, short for 'No Magic.' "" The essay also explains the ""legend of the Native American 'skin walker'  an evil witch or wizard that can transform into an animal at will.""

A member of the All Things Considered family has died. Alan Cheuse, who reviewed books on our air nearly every week since the early 1980s, passed away today after a car accident in California two weeks ago. He was 75 years old.

In two minutes every week, Alan paid his respects to good writing in his soft, intense, passionate voice.

Who ever read as much as Alan did? When he wasn't reading, he was teaching  over the years at Bennington, the University of Virginia, University of Michigan, and for the last two-plus decades, at George Mason University. And when he wasn't reading and teaching, he was writing. Five novels, novellas, short stories, textbooks.

It's a miracle that he found time for the solitude and concentration that writing demands: He was at the center of literary life in Washington, D.C., and a truly loving husband, father, and grandfather. But Alan did manage to do it all. Summers in Santa Cruz gave him solitary writing time, and time to teach at the Squaw Valley Writers Workshop. It was driving back from Northern California that he had the car accident.

Alan Cheuse was such a generous man. He always made time for his students. He always had suggestions to us, about writers to keep track of, as well as ones to avoid. He was a wonderful, caring, funny friend, full of stories and totally apt literary quotations. Good gossip too.

Those who knew him will remember him for all of that. Listeners will remember, and thank him, for all the reading in our behalf.

NPR's Kelly McEvers talks to petroleum-geologist-turned-writer Rick Bass about the art of the short story, specifically his short stories. A collection of the short stories he's written over the years is called, For A Little While.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

The life of author Rick Bass is quite a story. He grew up in Houston and became a petroleum geologist. He would write on his lunch breaks. And then, in 1987, he moved to rural Montana and became an environmental activist. Since then, he's written dozens of books - nonfiction, novels, short stories - and won many awards. His new short story collection is called ""For A Little While."" It's a mix of old and new stories. Rick Bass says a short story is the best way to deal with the fast pace of life right now.

RICK BASS: The short story is a beautiful reservoir that you enter. You learn something, and you get out. It fits our brain. It's a unique package, a lozenge, a lens that helps us process all kinds of information. The classic short story form with that elegant, tapered shape - it's not formulaic. It's organic, and it fits who we are as a species.

MCEVERS: Like Rick Bass, many of his characters are off the grid and surrounded by nature. And many of them are incredibly lonely, and so I asked him if loneliness is the price of living so close to the wild.

BASS: I don't think it's the woods that make them lonely. You know, it's just the atoms bouncing around faster and faster. We're being called upon to respond, respond, respond - less downtime, less leisure time, less thinking time, less - no processing time. And when you're tired, you don't have energy for passion. When you're tired or overwhelmed, you don't have the resources to dream a big life, live a big life, and that can present itself in the form of loneliness - like, gee, I wish I had a community where I could just have a meal and sit down and talk for a while. Or I wish I had time to hang out more with my kids, or I wish; I wish; I wish. I think, again, it comes back to a question of time, really. I think time is the - kind of the factor here, and the loneliness - again, not landscape or externalities.

MCEVERS: It's interesting you talk about that because, you know, your stories are very languid, you know? They move at their own pace. Do you feel that they've gotten more so as you've sort of sensed this yearning and need for more time and space?

BASS: I would suspect so. That wouldn't surprise me. What I'm hungering for as a reader is the visuals, the reminders that the world is a beautiful place, and I'm just trying to bring, you know, almost a painterly illumination on sentences, on objects, on subjects. And so there is going to be more attention to the brushwork. And I think we're so hungry to have our five senses engaged-slash-re-engaged, that that's the best way to do it - is with sentences. And the stories will take care of themselves from those sentences.

MCEVERS: There's this one story. It's called ""Pagans.""

BASS: Sure.

MCEVERS: First, can you just describe what's happening in that story and tell us where it's set?

BASS: It's set in Texas on the Gulf Coast in the 1970s, a time of great cultural and sociologic change. The two boys and the girl - they're just navigating adolescence. They're navigating the interesting interface between friendship and romantic love, skipping school and going off and mucking around on the bayou in this really rich, fertile, lush environment that's got a lot of toxins in it from ship channel plumes and so forth. And...

MCEVERS: Yeah. I mean, they're basically playing with these pieces of machinery that have been sunk in the river. The river, you say, is poisoned. They've built kind of an altar out of kind of a pile of garbage, you know? And yet, to them, it is beautiful. I'm wondering if you could read a passage. You have the book, right?

BASS: I do, yeah. I'd be happy to.

MCEVERS: To set this up, the character's looking back. It's at the very end of the story.

BASS: (Reading) He wonders sometimes if there are not the ghost or husks of their other lives living still far back in the past or far below or even further out into the future still together and still consorting other lives birth from that strange reservoir of joy and sweetness and utter newness. And if there are, how does he access that - through memory, through imagination? Even now, he marvels at how wise they were then and at all the paths they did not take.

MCEVERS: The passage is so interesting. You know, it almost sounds like you're talking directly to the reader and this idea that there's another version of this story, and it's being lived out now.

BASS: Yeah, yeah.

MCEVERS: That, to me, seems like what must be the joy of writing - is that you get to think up those versions.

BASS: You're totally on it. And I would not have thought of it myself consciously, but it comes back to this idea of scale and time. You know, as a geologist, one of the mystifying and challenging things about mapping is, you know, unconformities, these vast stretches of settlement deposition that have been re-eroded, washed away. So you'll have an old formation, then the middle formation will be gone. then you'll have a younger formation on top of it. And there'll just be this missing chunk of, you know, 200 million years or something that - and you might find a few fossils down in another formation. And you might have a fault in truth that lifts up older rock up above younger rock. But there's a lot of stuff that happens that we never know about, yeah, you know, under the ground.

MCEVERS: And the fun is filling in the blanks.

BASS: It really is, yeah, and trying to connect dots from just a very few clues.

MCEVERS: Well, Rick Bass, thank you so much for your time today.

BASS: Thank you, Kelly. I appreciate it.

MCEVERS: That's Rick Bass. He's the author of ""For A Little While,"" a new collection of stories new and old. It's out now.

A Reading List For Riding The Rails : NPR,[],"Patricia Highsmith and Agatha Christie made well-known use of the train as a confined setting for their thrillers  but a less well-known example is this violent, mesmerizing book from the great French novelist Emile Zola. It's part of his 20-volume Les Rougon-Macquart cycle, but don't worry, I've been assured that you don't have to read the other 19 if your beach bag just won't fit them and your sunscreen. La Bete Humaine isn't exactly a sunny read, though  it's an exploration of what kinds of murderous tendencies we've all got locked up in our psychological cupboards and how accessible the keys are. The book, with its high body count, is set against the backdrop of the railway between Paris and Le Havre. In just the first chapter a woman confesses to a sexual molestation in her past, is beaten and threatened by her own husband for the sin committed against her, and a plot to murder the molester is concocted. And we haven't even met the other main character, loosely based on Jack the Ripper, whose most potent love affair is with the train. Hey, it's not called The Human Kitten. What's the fun in reading this grisly story, besides the racing plot? It's Zola's exploration of what creates the desire to kill  all experienced from the safety of your own (hopefully) locked cupboard.

npr.org,,Iron Council,[],"Excerpt: Iron Council

Chapter One

A man runs. Pushes through thin bark-and-leaf walls, through the purposeless rooms of Rudewood. The trees crowd him. This far in the forest there are aboriginal noises. The canopy rocks. The man is heavy-burdened, and sweated by the unseen sun. He is trying to follow a trail.

Just before dark he found his place. Dim hotchi paths led him to a basin ringed by roots and stone-packed soil. Trees gave out. The earth was tramped down and stained with scorching and blood. The man spread out his pack and blanket, a few books and clothes. He laid down something well-wrapped and heavy among loam and centipedes.

Rudewood was cold. The man built a fire, and with it so close the darkness shut him quite out, but he stared into it as if he might see something emergent. Things came close. There were constant bits of sound like the bronchial call of a nightbird or the breath and shucking of some unseen predator. The man was wary. He had pistol and rifle, and one at least was always in his hand.

By flamelight he saw hours pass. Sleep took him and led him away again in little gusts. Each time he woke he breathed as if coming out of water. He was stricken. Sadness and anger went across his face.

""I'll come find you,"" he said.

He did not notice the moment of dawn, only that time skidded again and he could see the edges of the clearing. He moved like he was made of twigs, as if he had stored up the night's damp cold. Chewing on dry meat, he listened to the forest's shuffling and paced the dirt depression.

When finally he heard voices he flattened against the bank and looked out between the trunks. Three people approached on the paths of leaf-mould and forest debris. The man watched them, his rifle steadied. When they trudged into thicker shanks of light, he saw them clearly and let his rifle fall.

""Here,"" he shouted. They dropped foolishly and looked for him. He raised his hand above the earth rise.

They were a woman and two men, dressed in clothes more ill-suited to Rudewood than his own. They stood before him in the arena and smiled. ""Cutter."" They gripped arms and slapped his back.

""I heard you for yards. What if you was followed? Who else is coming?""

They did not know. ""We got your message,"" the smaller man said. He spoke fast and looked about him. ""I went and seen. We were arguing. The others were saying, you know, we should stay. You know what they said.""

""Yeah, Drey. Said I'm mad.""

""Not you.""

They did not look at him. The woman sat, her skirt filling with air. She was breathing fast with anxiety. She bit her nails.

""Thank you. For coming."" They nodded or shook Cutter's gratitude off: it sounded strange to him, and he was sure to them too. He tried not to make it sound like his sardonic norm. ""It means a lot."" * * * They waited in the sunken ground, scratched motifs in the earth or carved figures from dead wood. There was too much to say.

""So they told you not to come?""

The woman, Elsie, told him no, not so much, not in those words, but the Caucus had been dismissive of Cutter's call. She looked up at him and down quickly as she spoke. He nodded, and did not criticise.

""Are you sure about this?"" he said, and would not accept their desultory nods. ""Godsdammit are you sure? Turn your back on the Caucus? You ready to do that? For him? It's a long way we've got to go.""

""We already come miles in Rudewood,"" said Pomeroy.

""There's hundreds more. Hundreds. It'll be bastard hard. A long time. I can't swear we'll come back.""

I can't swear we'll come back.

Pomeroy said, ""Only tell me again your message was true. Tell me again he's gone, and where he's gone and what for. Tell me that's true."" The big man glowered and waited, and at Cutter's brief nod and closed eyes, he said, ""Well then.""

Others arrived then. First another woman, Ihona; and then as they welcomed her they heard stick-litter being destroyed in heavy leaps, and a vodyanoi came through the brush. He squatted in the froggish way of his race and raised webbed hands. When he jumped from the bank, his bodyhead and trunk all one fat sacrippled with impact. Fejhechrillen was besmirched and tired, his motion ill-suited to woodland.

They were anxious, not knowing how long they should wait, if any others would come. Cutter kept asking how they had heard his message. He made them unhappy. They did not want to consider their decision to join him: they knew there were many who would think it a betrayal.

""He'll be grateful,"" Cutter said. ""He's a funny bugger and might be he'll not show it, but this'll mean a lot, to me and to him.""

After silence Elsie said: ""You don't know that. He didn't ask us, Cutter. He just got some message, you said. He might be angry that we've come.""

Cutter could not tell her she was wrong. Instead he said: ""I don't see you leaving, though. We're here for us, maybe, as well as for him.""

He began to tell them what might be ahead, emphasising dangers. It seemed as if he wanted to dissuade them though they knew he did not. Drey argued with him in a rapid and nervy voice. He assured Cutter they understood. Cutter saw him persuading himself, and was silent. Drey said repeatedly that his mind was made up.

""We best move,"" said Elsie, when noon went. ""We can't wait forever. Anyone else is coming, they've obviously got lost. They'll have to go back to the Caucus, do what's needed in the city."" Someone gave a little cry and the company turned.

At the hollow's edge a hotchi rider was watching them, astride his gallus. The big war-cockerel plumped its breastfeathers and raised one spurred claw-foot in curious pose. The hotchi, squat and tough hedgehog man, stroked his mount's red comb.

""Militia coming."" His accent was strong and snarling. ""Two men militia coming, a minute, two."" He sat forward in the ornate saddle and turned his bird around. With very little sound, with no metal to jangle on wood-and-leather straps and stirrups, it picked away high-clawed and belligerent, and was hidden by the forest.

""Was that?"" ""What?"" ""Did you fucking?""

But Cutter and his companions were shushed by the sound of approach. They looked in unsaid panic, too late to hide.

Two men came stepping over fungused stumps into view. They were masked and uniformed in the militia's dark grey. Each had a mirrored shield and ungainly pepperpot revolver slack at his side. As they came into the clearing they faltered and were still, taking in the men and women waiting for them.

There was a dragged-out second when no one moved, when befuddled and silent conference was heldare you, are they, what, should we, should we?till someone shot. Then there were a spate of sounds, screams and the percussion of shots. People fell. Cutter could not follow who was where and was gut-terrified that he had been hit and not yet felt it. When the guns' heinous syncopation stopped, he unclenched his jaw.

Someone was calling Oh gods oh fucking gods. It was a militiaman, sitting bleeding from a belly-wound beside his dead friend and trying to hold his heavy pistol up. Cutter heard the curt torn-cloth sound of archery and the militia man lay back with an arrow in him and stopped his noise.

Again a beat of silence then ""Jabber"" ""Are you, is everyone?"" ""Drey? Pomeroy?""

First Cutter thought none of his own were hit. Then he saw how Drey was white and held his shoulder, and that blood dyed his palsying hands.

""Sweet Jabber, man."" Cutter made Drey sit (Is it all right? the little man kept saying.) Bullet had taken muscle. Cutter tore strips from Drey's shirt, and wound those cleanest around the hole. The pain made Drey fight, and Pomeroy and Fejh had to hold him. They gave him a thumb-thick branch to bite while they bandaged him.

""They must've fucking followed you, you halfwit bastards."" Cutter was raging while he worked. ""I told you to be fucking careful""

""We were,"" Pomeroy shouted, jabbing his finger at Cutter.

""Didn't follow them."" The hotchi reappeared, its rooster picking. ""Them patrol the pits. You been here long time, a day nearly."" It dismounted and walked the rim of the arena. ""You been too long.""

It showed the teeth in its snout in some opaque expression. Lower than Cutter's chest but rotundly muscular, it strutted like a bigger man. By the militia it stopped and sniffed. It sat up the one killed by its arrow and began to push the missile through the body.

""When them don't come back, them send more,"" it said. ""Them come after you. Maybe now."" It steered the arrow past bones through the dead chest. It gripped the shaft when it came out the corpse's back, and pulled the fletch through with a wet sound. The hotchi tucked it bloody into his belt, picked the revolving pistol from the militiaman's stiffening fingers and fired it against the hole.

Birds rose up again at the shot. The hotchi snarled with the unfamiliar recoil and shook its hand. The arrow's fingerthick burrow had become a cavity.

Pomeroy said: ""Godspit . . . who in hell are you?""

""Hotchi man. Cock-fighting man. Alectryomach. Help you.""

""Your tribe . . ."" said Cutter. ""They're with us? On our side? Some of the hotchi are with the Caucus,"" he said to the others. ""That's why this place's all right. Or was supposed to be. This lad's clan got no time for the militia. Give us passage. But . . . can't risk a real fight with the city, so they've to make it look like it was us killed the officers, not their arrows."" He understood as he said it.

Pomeroy and the hotchi rifled the killed men together. Pomeroy threw one of the pepperpot revolvers to Elsie, one to Cutter. It was modernistic and expensive and Cutter had never held one before. It was heavy, with its six barrels arranged in a fat rotating cylinder.

""They ain't reliable,"" said Pomeroy, harvesting bullets. ""Fast, though.""

""Jabber . . . we better fucking go."" Drey's voice went up and down with pain. ""Fucking guns going off going to call them for miles . . .""

""Not so many nearby,"" said the hotchi. ""Maybe none to hear. But you should gone, yes. What you for? Why leave city? You looking for him come by on the clay man?""

Cutter looked to the others and they watched him carefully, letting him speak.

He said: ""You seen him?"" He stepped toward the busy hotchi. ""You seen him?""

The world has frozen over in the movie Snowpiercer. Set after a climate change disaster, all the action happens aboard a train that has to keep circling the globe for its passengers to stay alive.

More From The Book Your Trip Series For more great train tales, check out NPR's Book Your Trip series. We've got recommendations for literary travel by train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time machine and even giant peach.

The movie itself is uniquely international: Snowpiercer is based on the French graphic novel Le Transperceneige by Jacques Lob, Benjamin Legrand and Jean-Marc Rochette. It's directed by a Korean auteur and stars Hollywood A-listers including Tilda Swinton and Ed Harris. The movie opened in South Korea last summer. Since then it has played all over the world, and certain Americans have been wildly impatient for Snowpiercer to open here.

What kinds of Americans, you ask? Well, film nerds, science fiction nerds, Tilda Swinton nerds and fans of director Bong Joon-ho.

Grady Hendrix, who co-runs the New York Asian Film Festival, says Bong's movies, such as 2003's Memories of Murder, masterfully subvert genres. ""His serial killer movie was actually an amazing movie about Korean history but also delivered the thrills you want in a serial killer movie,"" he explains.

And Bong's 2006 movie The Host was both a sly critique of American intervention in Korea dating back to the Korean War  and about a giant monster eating people. The Host smashed South Korean box office records and became an international sensation.

So it was hardly a surprise when the director's next big action film  Snowpiercer  was immediately snapped up by Hollywood distributors Bob and Harvey Weinstein.

""Uncle Harvey. We had a long process,"" Bong wryly remembers during an interview at NPR West in Culver City.

Snowpiercer's U.S. release was delayed for months as Bong and Weinstein  known in the film world as Harvey Scissorhands  wrangled over Weinstein's insistence over cutting 20 minutes from the two-hour film and adding a voice-over. Bong adamantly refused. The international film community rallied behind Bong Joon-ho. Eventually, the Weinsteins agreed to release Snowpiercer intact.

""Their idea to simplify was a very silly one,"" Hendrix observes. ""The movie is incredibly simple. It is a train. The poor people live in the back. The rich people live in the front. And the poor people in back want to get to the front.""

Bong says an oppressed underclass rebelling against huge wealth gaps is not exactly science fiction right now. ""[It's] similar to Occupy Wall Street in terms of the 99 percent versus the 1 percent,"" he says. ""That's something that happens in other countries and also in Korea.""

The film has been getting rave reviews, partly because of Bong's knack for keeping viewers off balance. Take a meditative, dreamlike scene where the freedom fighters pause for a snack in a train car that's also an aquarium and a sushi counter. (Of course, sushi is sort of shorthand for the preferred food of the 1 percent.)

It's really about having fun with the audience. People go to the movies with certain genre conventions in mind. They go to the movies to have certain expectations met. It's always fun to play around with those expectation

""Outside the window, you can see the frozen ocean, where the fish inside the tanks used to swim,"" Bong says.

Before the ocean was ruined  partly to make this food. Such pointed, ironic juxtapositions are Bong's stock in trade.

""It's really about having fun with the audience,"" he explains. ""People go to the movies with certain genre conventions in mind. They go to the movies to have certain expectations met. It's always fun to play around with those expectations, to deliver what they came to see, but also give them things they didn't expect.""

Like a message about income inequality or environmental cataclysm  in a high-octane summer action flick. That's what Bong delivers  along with violence, explosions and special effects.",[]

WHAT, you might ask, is Anna Karenina doing on the same summer reading list as The Little Engine That Could?

Let me explain.

In previous summers, we gave you lists and lists and lists of new books organized by genre. And that was fun. But this summer we wanted to try something different.

Back in December, when we worked on the year-end 2013 Best Books Concierge, one of the things we enjoyed most was finding common threads in very different books (just look at the unlikely titles that live together under the ""Funny Stuff"" category, or the ""Family Matters"" category). And that's how we ended up settling on this year's Book Your Trip project  a series that is much more about the journey than the destination, and aims to create a surprising, serendipitous book discovery experience for the summer months.

In March, the NPR Books team  Petra Mayer, Nicole Cohen, Rose Friedman and myself  reached out to our trusted reviewers, librarians and Arts Desk colleagues and asked them to brainstorm books that featured themes or memorable scenes of transportation and transit. As usual, they wrote back with hundreds of titles  both old and new. We spent the next month or so sorting those books  recommended by Lynn Neary, Michele Norris, Nancy Pearl, Maureen Corrigan, Neda Ulaby and many more. (You can hear Petra talk more about that process with Linda Wertheimer in the audio at the top of this page.)

Do LSD trips count? (Yes!) Can we call 'time' a mode of transit, or do we have to say time machine? (Eh. Still not sure. We couldn't agree.) Do the dogs and cat who travel by paw in 'The Incredible Journey' qualify for the 'by foot' list? (Sure, why not!) What do we do with 'James and the Giant Peach'? (Create a big 'miscellaneous' list, obviously.)

There were some pretty straightforward categories  train, plane, bike, boat ... but it didn't take long for things to get squirrelly. Do LSD trips count? (Yes!) Can we call ""time"" a mode of transit, or do we have to say time machine? (Eh. Still not sure. We couldn't agree.) Do the dogs and cat who travel by paw in The Incredible Journey qualify for the ""by foot"" list? (Sure, why not!) What do we do with James and the Giant Peach? (Create a big ""miscellaneous"" list, obviously.)

It wasn't always pretty, but eventually we settled on 12 lists: train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time and a miscellaneous category that includes drugs, dragons and giant peaches. (A moment of silence here for a fun list called ""Connections"" that included books featuring multiple modes of transit  like Nellie Bly's Around the World in Seventy-Two Days. Things were just getting too unwieldy, and it didn't make the cut.)

Speaking of things that didn't make the cut: These lists are not comprehensive. They aren't even a little comprehensive. Months before we pressed publish, we were bracing ourselves for the inevitable: NPR, HOW DARE YOU PUBLISH A LIST OF HORSE BOOKS AND NOT INCLUDE [INSERT NAME OF FAVORITE HORSE BOOK HERE]  I'LL NEVER DONATE ANOTHER DIME!!

Honestly, these lists could have gone on forever. We had to stop somewhere. So please don't stop supporting your local member station because Misty of Chincoteague didn't make it. (If you must know: It's because we decided it was about horses, but not horses as a mode of transit). We tried to select an idiosyncratic mix of old and new, known and unknown, and books for new and experienced readers alike. The point is book discovery, so we didn't always pick obvious books; we hope browsing this series feels like wandering into an unfamiliar section of the library.

On the car list, you'll find 'Go, Dog, Go!' and 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.' And  perhaps for the first time ever  Che Guevara and Beverly Cleary are hanging out together with 'The Motorcycle Diaries' and 'The Mouse and the Motorcycle.'

Our favorite thing about these lists is the surprising and funny combinations you get when you decide to look at a very specific slice of something. We love that Anna Karenina and The Little Engine That Could are side by side. On the car list, you'll find Go, Dog. Go! and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. And  perhaps for the first time ever  Che Guevara and Beverly Cleary are hanging out together with The Motorcycle Diaries and The Mouse and the Motorcycle.

Is this a useful way to organize books? We're not really sure. But it was a fun and interesting exercise, and it made us all add a bunch of new titles to our own reading lists. We hope you'll find some books that are new to you as well. Stay tuned in the coming months  our friends on the Arts Desk will be bringing you Book Your Trip stories on-air. (Bob Mondello has had us tapping our toes to transit-themed show tunes for weeks.)

And of course, outrage aside, we really would like to hear about the books that you would add to the lists. So please share your favorites with us in the comments section of the lists, or tweet them with the hashtag #bookyourtrip.

As always, we know you have a choice when you listen, so we'd like to thank you for choosing NPR Airwaves. You are now free to move about the cabin.",[]

He announced his diagnosis on Facebook almost three weeks ago, saying ""I intend to fight it hard.""

Today's statement from Todd Doughty, executive director of publicity at Doubleday included comments from Conroy's wife and his longtime editor:

i Matailong Du/NPR Matailong Du/NPR

In 1927, the U.S. Supreme Court decided, by a vote of 8 to 1, to uphold a state's right to forcibly sterilize a person considered unfit to procreate. The case, known as Buck v. Bell, centered on a young woman named Carrie Buck, whom the state of Virginia had deemed to be ""feebleminded.""

Author Adam Cohen tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that Buck v. Bell was considered a victory for America's eugenics movement, an early 20th century school of thought that emphasized biological determinism and actively sought to ""breed out"" traits that were considered undesirable.

""There were all kinds of categories of people who were deemed to be unfit [to procreate],"" Cohen says. ""The eugenicists looked at evolution and survival of the fittest, as Darwin was describing it, and they believed 'We can help nature along, if we just plan who reproduces and who doesn't reproduce.' ""

All told, as many as 70,000 Americans were forcibly sterilized during the 20th century. The victims of state-mandated sterilization included people like Buck who had been labeled ""mentally deficient,"" as well as those who who were deaf, blind and diseased. Minorities, poor people and ""promiscuous"" women were often targeted.

Cohen's new book about the Buck case, Imbeciles, takes its name from the terms eugenicists used to categorize the ""feebleminded."" In it, he revisits the Buck v. Bell ruling and explores the connection between the American eugenics movement and the rise of the Nazi party in Germany.

Cohen notes that the instinct to ""demonize"" people who are different is still prevalent in the U.S. today, particularly in the debate over immigration.

""I think these instincts to say that we need to stop these other people from 'polluting us,' from changing the nature of our country, they're very real,"" Cohen warns. ""The idea that those who don't remember the past are condemned to repeat it  it's very troubling that we don't remember this past.""

Interview Highlights

On the case of Carrie Buck

This is this poor young woman, really nothing wrong with her physically or mentally, a victim of a terrible sexual assault, and there's a little hearing, she's declared feebleminded and she gets sent off to the colony for epileptics and feebleminded. ...

Imbeciles The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck by Adam Cohen Hardcover, 402 pages | purchase Purchase Featured Book Your purchase helps support NPR Programming. How?

When she's at the colony, the guy who is running the colony, Dr. Albert Priddy, is on the prowl. He's looking for someone to put at the center of this test case that they want to bring, so he's looking for someone to sterilize, and he sees Carrie Buck when she comes in, he does the examination himself, and there are a lot of things about her that excite him. She is deemed to be feebleminded, she has a mother who is feebleminded, so that's good because you can show some genetics, and then they're hoping that [her] baby could be determined to be feebleminded too, then you could really show a genetic pattern of feeblemindedness. The fact that she had been pregnant out of wedlock was another strike against her. So he fixes on her and thinks Carrie Buck is going to be the perfect potential plaintiff. ...

He chooses her, and then under the Virginia law, they have to have a sterilization hearing at the colony, which they do and they give her a lawyer (who is really not a lawyer for her; it's really someone who had been the chairman of the board of the colony and was sympathetic to the colony's side) and they have a bit of a sham hearing where she is determined to be a suitable person for sterilization; they vote to sterilize her, and that is the order that then gets challenged by Carrie as the plaintiff first in the Virginia court system and then in the Supreme Court.

On why he considers Buck v. Bell to be one of the worst Supreme Court decisions in American history

If you start by just looking at all the human misery that was inflicted, about 70,000 Americans were sterilized as a result of this decision, so that's an awful lot of people who wanted to have children who weren't able to have children. Also, we have to factor in all the many people who were being segregated, who were being held in these institutions for eugenic reasons, because they were feebleminded, whose lives unfolded living in places like the colony, rather than living in freedom. Beyond the human effect though, there was something just so ugly about this decision and when [we] think about what we want the Supreme Court to be, what the founders wanted the Supreme Court to be, it was supposed to be our temple of justice, the place that people could go when all the other parts of our society, all the other parts of the government, were not treating them right.

On how eugenicists sought to address the ""threat"" to the gene pool

The eugenicists saw two threats to the national gene pool: One was the external one, which they were addressing through immigration law; the other was the internal one  what to do about the people who were already here. They had a few ideas.

The first eugenics law in the United States was passed in Connecticut in 1895, and it was a law against certain kinds of marriages. They were trying to stop certain unfit people from reproducing through marriage. It wasn't really what they wanted, though, because they realized that people would just reproduce outside of marriage.

So their next idea was what they called segregation. The idea was to get people who were deemed unfit institutionalized during their reproductive years, particularly for women, keep them there, make sure they didn't reproduce, and then women were often let go when they had passed their reproductive years because they were no longer a threat to the gene pool. That had a problem too, though. The problem was that it would be really expensive to segregate, institutionalize the number of people the eugenicists were worried about. ...

Their next idea was eugenic sterilization and that allowed for a model in which they would take people in to institutions, eugenically sterilize them, and then they could let them go, because they were no longer a threat. That's why eugenic sterilization really became the main model that the eugenicists embraced and that many states enacted laws to allow.

On deeming people ""feebleminded""

""Feebleminded"" was really the craze in American eugenics. There was this idea that we were being drowned in a tide of feeblemindedness  that basically unintelligent people were taking over, reproducing more quickly than the intelligent people  but it was also a very malleable term that was used to define large categories of people that again, were disliked by someone who was in the decision-making position. So, women who were thought to be overly interested in sex, licentious, were sometimes deemed feebleminded. It was a broad category and it was very hard to prove at one of these feeblemindedness hearings that you were not feebleminded.

On the involuntary sterilization procedure

For men it was something like a vasectomy. For women it was a salpingectomy, where they cauterized the path that the egg takes toward fertilization. It was, in the case of women, not minor surgery and when you read about what happened, it's many, many days of recovery and it had certain dangers attached to it, and a lot of the science was still quite new. ...

When you add onto all that, the fact that in many, many cases the women involved were not told what was being done to them, they might be told that they were having an appendectomy, they weren't being told that the government has decided that you are unfit to reproduce and we're then going to have surgery on you, so that just compounds the horror of the situation.

On how the Nazis borrowed from the U.S. eugenics sterilization program

We really were on the cutting edge. We were doing a lot of this in the 1910s and 1920s. Indiana adopted a eugenic sterilization law, America's first in 1907. We were writing the eugenics sterilization statutes that decided who should be sterilized. We also had people who were writing a lot of what might be thought of as pro-Aryan theory. So you have people like Madison Grant who wrote a very popular book called The Passing of a Great Race, which really talked about the superiority of Nordics, as he called them, and how they were endangered by all the brown people and the non-Nordics who were taking over.

On a 1924 immigration law, which was inspired by eugenicists, that prevented Anne Frank's family from entering the U.S.

Under the old immigration laws where it was pretty much ""show up,"" they would've been able to emigrate, but suddenly they were trapped by very unfavorable national quotas, so this really was a reason that so many Jews were turned away.

One very poignant aspect of it that I've thought about as I was working on the book is in the late '90s some correspondence appeared, was uncovered, in which Otto Frank was writing repeatedly to the State Department begging for visas for himself and his wife and his two daughters, Margot and Anne, and was turned down, and that was because there were now these quotas in place. If they had not been, it seems clear that he would've been able to get a visa for his whole family, including his daughter Anne Frank.

So when we think about the fact that Anne Frank died in a concentration camp, we're often told that it was because the Nazis believed the Jews were genetically inferior, that they were lesser than Aryans. That's true, but to some extent Anne Frank died in a concentration camp because the U.S. Congress believed that as well.",[]

SOMINI SENGUPTA: They join the labor force. They register to vote. They embrace the Internet, many of them for the first time. They fall in love. And all those things change their own country profoundly.

SHAPIRO: It's a country with a democratic government, a country with constitutional guarantees. And that means it's a country with enormous expectations and challenges.

SENGUPTA: One is how to level the playing field so that there's at least some equality of opportunity for both men and women and, I would argue, particularly women who have really not enjoyed the equality that the Constitution of India had promised them 70 years ago. And the other related challenge is how much to let this generation speak their mind. India has always had a very ambivalent relationship with free expression, and that is all the more pronounced now during the Internet age.

SHAPIRO: Somini Sengupta follows seven young people and their aspirations in her latest book, ""The End Of Karma: Hope And Fury Among India's Young.""

SENGUPTA: I call this ""The End Of Karma"" because the people I write about - they're all trying to overcome their past. They were born with one destiny. They are trying to make another. And they're all stories of incredible grit and resilience and great hope but also a bit of fury - quite a bit of fury, which is why the subtitle of the book is ""Hope And Fury Among India's Young.""

SHAPIRO: And this idea of trying to overcome your past - how new is that for India - that your past is not necessarily destined to be your future.

SENGUPTA: I'll tell you the story of one child who I met in reporting this book. Her name what's in reporting this book. Her name is Varsha (ph). She was the daughter of what's known as a presswala (ph). Her family had a business pressing clothes at the end of a block under a tree. And ever since Varsha was a small girl, she would go around collecting the rumpled bundles of clothes, and she would help her parents pressing them - saris and salwar kameezes and button-down shirts. And the one thing she didn't want to be was a presswala or a presswala's wife. And she really, really wanted to be a cop, a policewoman.

And her father, who was her great champion, was also very much against this idea. He wanted to marry her off to a good family, and he couldn't bear the idea of her being a policewoman. So the story of Varsha is really the story of a girl who tries to overcome her past, who tries to grow wings and a story of a father who has to decide how far he will let her go.

SHAPIRO: Do you expect that five years from now she'll be a police officer or a presswala or something else?

SENGUPTA: I think it depends largely on how hard Varsha is willing to push. She has already pushed her father to go quite a mile. Her father did not want her to even finish high school or go to college. He was very nervous about what would happen to her, and she's managed to push him ever so steadily just by dint of determination and resilience. But she has also had to tamp down her dreams every step of the way.

SHAPIRO: So many of the stories in this book reminded me of stories we hear about early 20th century America. And almost the minute that thought entered my head, (laughter) I reached the sentence you wrote, this country is not a country of Horatio Algers, referring, of course, to the quintessential story of transcending destiny in early 20th century America. So while many of the stories do follow this model that the U.S. seems to have followed a hundred years ago, you're saying, no, there's a big difference here.

SENGUPTA: Well, I think the myth of Horatio Alger has increasingly been shown to be a myth even in our own country. But I think you're absolutely right that the parallels between India and the United States are just remarkable. India was a very unlikely country at its birth in 1947. It was made up of a bunch of different ethnicities, a lot of different languages. And frankly, there were a lot of naysayers who said there's no way that a country that is so poor, that is so diverse is ever going to hold together.

It did hold together, and it has made some remarkable gains since independence. My parents, who were born during the independence era - they're called midnight's children. In their time, life expectancy was 32, and today, it's 66. In their time, infant mortality rates were sky high, and now it's diminished remarkably. In my father's time, when he went to school, there were fewer than half of all Indian children who were enrolled in school. They certainly didn't include dalits or outcasts. They certainly didn't include many girls. And today, nearly all Indian children are in school.

SHAPIRO: Your parents, who, as you say, came of age in the era of Indian independence, were known as midnight's children, a phrase made famous by Salman Rushdie in his novel. You call this young generation noonday's children. Explain what that means.

SENGUPTA: This generation of Indians, because their expectations are so high, they are so demanding and so restive in many ways that I think of India at this moment as a country at high noon. And I'll tell you one story. I remember going out to a school in rural India in a state called Bihar. And it was wintertime, and it was early in the morning. It was a bright, sunny, crisp morning. The mist was rising from the fields. And all these children were just streaming into school, carrying these empty rice sacks because that's what they would sit on. There was not enough chairs or tables or benches for them, and so they would spread them out on the floor, on the grass outside of school, and they would try to get an education.

Now, I went there with a remarkable Indian NGO called Bhutan. They were trying to assess what children were actually learning in school. And as it turned out, half of all fifth-graders couldn't read a basic sentence. Half of all fifth-graders couldn't subtract. And these were children who had been in school for five years. And I'll never forget what one of the social workers who I accompanied - he said to me, you know, when these children grow up, they'll curse us. They'll say, we came to school, and we learned nothing.

SHAPIRO: And your commitment to these people whose stories you tell really comes across in the book where, again and again, I was struck by the number of times you would follow up with a 14-year-old as a 17-year-old (laughter) or an 18-year-old as a 21-year-old, not just tracking their stories but perhaps giving them career advice and helping provide perspective. You come across as very, very invested in these stories.

SENGUPTA: Well, thank you. I did get pretty close to all of these young people, some more than others. And I have to say, I had to resist giving the girl that I described earlier, Varsha - I had to resist giving her too much career advice because I did, at one point, consider giving her the form - the application form to fill out for the Indian Police Service. And then I stopped myself. I thought, well, you know, that's for her to do.

SHAPIRO: Somini Sengupta covers the United Nations for The New York Times, and her new book is called ""The End Of Karma: Hope And Fury Among India's Young"" - great talking to you. Thank you so much.

SENGUPTA: Thank you, Ari.

From Chuck Holmes:

Please use separatist fighters and their Russian allies to describe the anti-government forces in eastern Ukraine. Using separatist fighters alone could suggest that only locals are involved.

Kevin Beesley and Corey Flintoff offer the following guidance:

Pro-Russian Separatists could mislead our audience into thinking that most of the fighting is being done by local fighters. There is a lot of evidence that most, though not all, of the anti-government forces involved are Russian citizens  although Russia denies its military is directly involved. So weve come up with another construction that we think more accurately reflects the situation on the ground: Separatist fighters and their Russian allies. As in: After weeks of heavy fighting, a strategic town in eastern Ukraine has fallen to separatist fighters and their Russian allies.

i toggle caption Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty Images Damien Meyer/AFP/Getty Images

An investigation into a clinical test in France that left one person dead and put five in the hospital has found evidence of brain damage in people who took high doses of the experimental pain medicine.

The early-stage clinical study, conducted by Biotrial in France, was halted in January when the side effects surfaced. It was the first time the drug, made by the Portuguese company Bial and known as ""BIA 10-2474,"" was tested in humans.

A report released Monday by a committee of scientists says people who got high cumulative doses of the drug sustained damage to their brains, specifically the hippocampus and pons. Those who got lower doses had no consistent adverse reactions.

The reports says the patients' symptoms and injuries were ""completely unusual, with no relatedness to a known disease or toxicity.""

Previous tests in rats, mice, dogs and monkeys involved doses up to 650 times those given to human subjects. While some animals had brain damage or died when given extremely high doses, there were no consistent signs indicating the drug would be unsafe for humans.

The molecule is meant to inhibit an enzyme called fatty acid amide hydrolase with a central role in the endocannabinoid system, a set of receptors also involved in processing THC, an ingredient in marijuana.

In all, 90 people took the experimental drug, at different doses. The six who were hospitalized had gotten the highest dose, which was 10 to 40 times higher than that needed to completely block the enzyme.

""We don't know by what mechanism the molecule caused these lesions, and I fear we won't know it for a long time since they couldn't have been due to the endocannabinoid system that was targeted by the molecule,"" Dr. Bernard Begaud, who leads the scientific committee investigating the incident, told the French publication Sciences et Avenir.

Two similar compounds were abandoned by other companies because they weren't deemed effective.

Often, the intensity of a drug's side effects increase with the dose. But in this case, the investigators note, there was no sign of a linear pattern. People who received a cumulative dose less than 200 milligrams were, for the most part, fine. But all six patients who received a cumulative dose higher than 250 milligrams had ""serious central nervous system symptoms.""

At those doses, the report authors hypothesize, the molecule may have suppressed the target enzyme too much, preventing it from breaking down other chemicals. That may have allowed a chemical like anandamide, which is present in chocolate in tiny amounts, to build up to dangerous concentrations in the brain.

Another idea is that the molecule acted on unintended enzymes or that it produced toxic byproducts in the brain.

The group, set up by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety, will reconvene later this month to review hypotheses on what went wrong and to make recommendations to the French government to improve clinical trial regulations.

The committee has also asked Bial to explain why the company did preliminary studies in four species of animals, as opposed to the usual two, why it decided to continue studies on the potential pain reliever when it only worked in two animal tests, and why it chose to test such high cumulative doses in people.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is also investigating the case. The agency said in late January that while this drug hasn't been tested in the U.S., there are studies on other drugs that work the same way.",[]

In a decision that triggers hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of payments to consumers, the Supreme Court on Monday denied Apple's request to hear its appeal of a lower court's ruling that the tech company had illegally fixed prices with publishers of e-books.

""The Justice Department says today's decision means Apple's liability in the price fixing case is settled once and for all,"" NPR's Lynn Neary reports. ""The Supreme Court let stand a $450 million settlement reached in a lower court in 2014.""

All of the publishers that were named in the case have already settled with the government, paying a combined $166 million.

In late 2014, Apple settled a class-action lawsuit over e-book pricing that had been brought by consumers and 33 U.S. states, but the payments in that case were predicated upon the outcome of Apple's appeal of the federal antitrust case. Today's rejection by the Supreme Court triggers Apple's payment of some $400 million to people who bought e-books.

""Most e-book purchasers will receive reimbursement for the higher prices Apple's conduct caused them to pay through automatic credits at their e-book retailers,"" the Justice Department says. ""They will be able to apply these credits to future purchases.""

The case's roots date back at least six years, when Apple sold its first iPad models and sought to compete with books giant Amazon as well as Barnes and Noble (both companies had already released their own e-book devices). Apple also launched an e-book marketplace for the iPad  and it was found to have conspired with five large book publishers to set prices that were higher than Amazon's.

Back in 2013, NPR reported that Apple's CEO Steve Jobs had been found to have sent an email to News Corp. executive James Murdoch, urging the participation of News Corp. property HarperCollins, including this line: ""Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream ebooks market at $12.99 and $14.99.""",[]

As part of NPR's ""Book Your Trip"" series, TV critic Eric Deggans looks at a different kind of summertime journey, described in two books that became TV shows: PBS's documentary Freedom Summer, debuting tonight, and The Hallmark Channel's The Watsons Go to Birmingham.

When I was a kid in the mid-1970s, friends around my Indiana hometown talked about summers ""down South"" like they were heading to Disney World.

The trip was an annual, comforting ritual for black families up North with roots in the Deep South.

But there was a time, just a decade earlier, when traveling down South could mean taking your life in your hands if you were black.

""Spending a summer in Mississippi taught me a lot about this country,"" says volunteer Karin Kunstler in the first moments of PBS's American Experience documentary Freedom Summer. ""My high school social studies teacher taught me that we all have rights. Mississippi summer taught me that we didn't all have rights.""

Watch a Preview of 'Freedom Summer' PBS YouTube

Kunstler was one of more than 700 mostly white student volunteers who headed to Mississippi in the summer of 1964 to challenge segregation. Freedom Summer tells the tumultuous, emotional story of that journey, using archival photos and fresh interviews with the participants to re-create one of the most dangerous summertime trips of that time.

Volunteers rode buses from Ohio to Mississippi, where they would live with black families scattered throughout the state.

At first, they felt a joyous excitement known as a ""freedom high,"" says Freedom Summer author Bruce Watson. But then, reality hit home.

""There was a lot of singing, a lot of freedom songs being sung on the bus, until they reached Mississippi,"" Watson says. ""And then, in most cases, the buses were met at the state line by highway patrolmen, who had known, of course, that they were coming. And many volunteer[s] told me that at that point, when they crossed the line, the singing stopped and it got very serious from then on.""

Once in Mississippi, volunteers faced another journey, learning to live in the crushing poverty and strict segregation suffered by their hosts.

""It's 100 years of Jim Crow ... that insisted that black people defer to whites in a way that was really shocking to everyone from the North,"" says Watson. ""Black people had to get off the sidewalk if a white person approached; black people were never called by Mr. or Mrs., they were always called by their first name or just 'boy.' All of these things, the degradation and poverty, was really startling to the volunteers, even though they had been told about it.""

Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the District of Columbia in Congress, was a law student in 1964 who helped develop training programs for Freedom Summer volunteers.

""It's very different, even for a black kid ... going [down South] in '63 or '64,"" says Norton. ""Because then you're going with the civil rights movement in hand. So you're going critical of the environment ... which is something you might not have done in the 1950s.""

Norton also saw racist violence up close, when she tried to rescue noted activist Fannie Lou Hamer from a Mississippi jail.

toggle caption Annette Brown/Hallmark Channel

""When I asked to see Miss Hamer, this storied woman leader of the civil rights movement in the South that she was to become, she had been beaten unmercifully by a black trusty,"" she says. ""And [the white prison guards] told him, if you don't beat her [hard enough], we'll see just how you beat her and we're going to beat you even harder.""

But even the worst violence, the murder of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, didn't keep volunteers away.

For a less violent, more personal journey, viewers can watch the Hallmark Channel's adaptation of The Watsons Go to Birmingham. It's a story about an unassuming black family caught up in the civil rights struggle while visiting relatives in Alabama  a perfect metaphor for the bitttersweet experience of traveling south back then, according to the book's author, Christopher Paul Curtis.

""When people would discuss about going south, there would be almost this idyllic tone to what they were saying,"" Curtis says. ""And you know that's not quite true, when people are being lynched and you can't have certain jobs and take care of things like that. But I think it's human nature ... [to] gloss over the bad things and remember the good.""

In one scene, the parents must tell their children how rules for travel are different in the deep South than in their Michigan hometown, noting they'll be traveling during daylight and exercising care about where they make rest stops.

Curtis says he based such scenes on information he got from older relatives who once traveled in the segregated South. ""When African-American people would travel from the North to the South, you had to do a lot of planning beforehand,"" he adds. ""There were actually books that told black people where they could stop, that gave restaurants that were either black owned or would serve black people.""

The contrast between both shows is telling. The Hallmark Channel movie features a family who joins the civil rights struggle, almost by accident. PBS's Freedom Summer shows volunteers who deliberately challenged injustice.

But both TV programs also depict another important journey: how the nation was led away from segregation by people willing to take a dangerous stand for equality.",[]

It took Abdul Arian months to realize that his decision to migrate from his home country, Afghanistan, to Germany was a huge mistake.

He set off nearly a year ago, hoping to be granted asylum so that he could go to university and study psychology.

His journey, organized by smugglers, was long and perilous. Arian, 24, says he nearly drowned off the shores of Greece, when the inflatable dinghy he was traveling in capsized.

He says he and his fellow travelers got lost somewhere in Hungary and walked through the rain for 24 hours before they found the path again.

Yet the reason that Arian finally saw his mistake was not because something nasty or dangerous happened to him. It was because nothing really happened at all.

When Arian arrived in Germany, he was placed in a migrants' reception center.

""We had nothing to do in the camp,"" he says. ""We just stayed there.""

He played a lot of soccer. He ate a lot of jelly sandwiches. He moped about. Officials wrote down his name. In the end, he says, he was in Germany for 10 months, yet ""no one asked me why I went there and why I was there."" No one seemed to want to listen to him explain why he should be allowed to stay.

It also soon became clear to Arian that local Germans did not appreciate his presence. While people from the church and social workers helped the migrants and were ""very nice,"" residents of the nearby village seemed hostile.

""When we were walking along the sidewalk, people would avoid us,"" says Arian.

Germany Says Many Must Leave

Last year, 150,000 Afghans arrived in Germany. The German authorities estimate less that half qualify for asylum.

German officials say at present a tiny number of Afghans  1,600, according to estimates given to them by Afghan officials in Germany  are willing to go back home voluntarily.

But many will have to leave, says Germany's ambassador to Afghanistan, Markus Potzel.

""It means that more than half of them have to be sent back because they can't stay,"" says Potzel. ""There are some obstacles for them to be sent back immediately, but we have a huge number of Afghans who are not eligible to stay in Germany and should be sent back.""

During Arian's time in Germany, he began to notice that Syrian migrants were being treated very differently. They were provided with language lessons and eventually passports, he says.

""When we complained to the social workers, they responded frankly. They said, 'We've invited Syrians here, not Afghans,' "" he says.

This prompted some of Arian's fellow Afghans to stage demonstrations.

""They were shouting, 'We don't want to go back to Afghanistan! There is a war there!' "" he says. ""But no one listened to them.""

The weeks rolled by. Arian was moved to another center. But still nothing happened. He grew steadily more convinced that he had no chance of being allowed to stay in Germany. Then depression set in.

""I was in very bad condition. I couldn't sleep. I decided to go back to Afghanistan, before I went crazy,"" he says.

Arian returned home last month. He was one of 125 Afghans sent back to Afghanistan on a charter flight organized by the German and Afghan governments. The passengers all signed a form saying they were returning voluntarily.

Arian's family spent most of their savings on his trip to Germany. To pay the smuggler's bill of $7,500, they sold land and a car. Arian is now worrying about what his family feels about that.

""So far, I haven't seen any reaction from them because I've just arrived back. But I don't know what's in their hearts,"" he says.

Arian is faced with finding work amid rampant unemployment in a society where good jobs are very hard to find without political or personal connections  or cash for a hefty bribe.

Humiliation For Some

That much is clear from the experience of Shirdil Bayat, 40. He was deported from Denmark two years ago, after a court rejected his request for asylum  which he'd based on a claim that his life was threatened by the Taliban in his home city, Kandahar.

Lacking personal connections, Bayat took 16 months to find permanent work as an office cleaner in the capital, Kabul. He says returning home to Kandahar is still too risky. On a recent day when he was interviewed by NPR, he'd been laid off because of budget cuts. He says he has no idea what he'll do next.

Bayat says returning to Afghanistan after having failed in Europe can be very humiliating. Some families are sympathetic, but far from all.

""People jeer at you. They ask, 'Why did so-and-so get citizenship in Europe while you did not? Maybe you're useless,' "" he says.

The Germans are running a PR campaign in Afghanistan, trying to deter Afghans from traveling to their land. They've posted announcements on billboards, buses and the Internet, urging Afghans to think twice before setting off.

Germany views many of the Afghans who've arrived on its soil as economic migrants seeking jobs or education.

German officials maintain that under international law, Germany is not required to grant asylum to those migrants  unlike Syrians, who are fleeing a war zone.

The United Nations estimates that last year, some 11,000 civilians were killed or injured by conflict in Afghanistan. Afghans say that bolsters proof that there is war in Afghanistan, too  and that Afghans should therefore be granted protection by European nations.

""Afghans are not leaving Afghanistan because of a lack of jobs, "" says Ashraf Haidari, director-general of policy and strategy at Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry. ""They are fleeing generalized violence. Terrorism that is killing men, women and children,"" he says. ""That - and political uncertainty as a result of withdrawal of international forces and diminishing international development aid.""

Germany Draws A Distinction

However, Potzel, Germany's ambassador, says the situation in Afghanistan differs hugely from Syria's.

""Here in Afghanistan, you don't have a government who would bomb their own population,"" he says. ""Here, the government tries to protect their own people. There are unsafe regions and there are less unsafe regions in Afghanistan, and there are regions  especially in the big cities  where a sort of normal life is going on.""

Germany is one of the main international donors to Afghanistan. Over the last 14 years, it has poured a great deal of money into the country. It seems unlikely that it would wish to risk making Afghanistan still more unstable by forcibly returning large numbers of Afghans over a short time span.

Yet there is considerable concern in Afghanistan about what might happen if significant numbers of angry and disillusioned young Afghans are eventually sent back from Europe.

Some European countries provide financial support packages to help people settle in, but the sums are generally small and over a limited time period.

Professor Sayed Masoud, an economist based in Kabul, foresees ""disaster.""

""Either they will join the Taliban or become drug addicts,"" he says, ""because the government can't provide jobs.""

Meanwhile, Afghans keep heading on the trail to Europe. On a recent early morning in Kabul, hundreds of men were lined up outside the government office that issues passports.

Among them was Wahidullah Mohammadi, 19, who wants to migrate to Europe to go to school. He is aware of the risk of being deported back home  and of losing the thousands of dollars he'll pay to smugglers.

Still, he still thinks the odds are worth it.

""The situation is not good here and there is no guaranteed future,"" he says. ""This is why I have to accept this risk.""",[]

While most of the country would be happy never to hear the word ""Deflategate"" ever again, people named Goodell are still very concerned with the year-old scandal and whether New England Patriots' quarterback Tom Brady tampered with game balls.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell  whose four-game suspension of Brady was overturned by a judge  is likely keeping a close eye on the Deflategate case as it winds its way through federal appeals court. But there's another Goodell committed to proving Brady didn't do it.

Ben Goodell, a seventh-grader from Lynn, Mass., dedicated his science fair project to measuring how weather conditions affected the PSI [pounds per square inch] of footballs in a bid to prove the Patriots did nothing illicit.

""I wanted to prove that Tom Brady is innocent,"" the 12-year-old St. Pius V Elementary School student, who isn't related to the NFL commissioner, told local TV station NECN.

And his project won.

Goodell was one of approximately 120 students who participated in the school's annual science fair, and one of only eight to win the Outstanding Project Award, according to The Daily Item. The newspaper reports Goodell began his experiment with a football inflated to the NFL standard and then exposed it to different weather conditions, including humidity, snow, wind chill, cold and ice.

""Every time, it dropped two PSI [pounds per square inch],"" Goodell, a Patriots fan, told the Item. ""The lowest PSI recorded during deflategate was 2 PSI under proper inflation.""

Principal Paul D. Maestranzi said the goal of the science fair is to get students to try and answer an everyday question.

""It's more tied in with current thinking,"" he told the newspaper. ""I think some people think science is only in a laboratory. It's really all around us all the time. That's what gets kids hooked: relevance.""

So, kudos to Ben Goodell for his experiment. Hopefully, Deflategate  the stale and bungled controversy that it is  will soon cease to be relevant.",[]

Please avoid referring to the people in Baltimore who have injured police officers, started fires, looted stores and vandalized properties as simply protesters.

Reports from Baltimore indicate that some people are taking advantage of the situation to lash out at authorities or to grab what they can from businesses. Those are not just protesters in the sense of the word that normally comes to mind.

Likewise, it is too simple to say that protests turned violent. That paints a picture of a peaceful gathering that changed into a rock-throwing, tear-gas flying confrontation between citizens and police. Reports from Baltimore indicate thats not been the case in many instances.

As in other cases weve discussed, its wise to avoid labels. In this case, protesters is a label thats too broad. The better approach is to focus on action words and describe whats been happening.

On a Newscast this morning, Dave Mattingly said that rioting [in Baltimore] yesterday injured 15 police officers. More than a dozen buildings and nearly 150 vehicles were set on fire. He noted that the violence followed the funeral for 25-year-old Freddie Gray.

Korva Coleman used similar language, saying that Gov. Larry Hogan has declared a state of emergency in Baltimore, after rioting broke out yesterday. ... Some residents started fires and clashed with police.

Morning Edition introduced a report from Jennifer Ludden with this language:

Lets go directly to Baltimore, this morning. Thats where people threw cinder blocks at police and set stores on fire. They did all that after the funeral for a black man who died in police custody. NPRs Jennifer Ludden is tracking the aftermath of the death of Freddie Gray. Jennifer, whats it like in Baltimore?

LABELS AND WHY ITS WISE TO AVOID THEM

 Immigrants.

 Medical conditions.

 Teenager.

 Victims vs. survivors. (Particularly in cases of sexual assault.)

Update at 9:55 a.m. ET:

We should also avoid saying that Freddie Gray died while in police custody. He had been arrested, so he had been taken into custody. But it was a week after his arrest, and he was in a hospital, when he died. The phrase in police custody calls to mind someone who is in a jail cell, or who is in handcuffs in the back of a police cruiser.

A woman who runs an organization in mainly Kurdish Northern Iraq, where women face threats, is in Washington to receive an award from Vital Voices, a non-profit group that puts a spotlight on women.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

And now let's meet someone who has dedicated her life to promoting women's rights in a troubled part of the world. She will be honored tonight at the Kennedy Center here in Washington by the group Vital Voices. She's an Iraqi woman. Her fight began at home, as NPR's Michele Kelemen found out.

MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Khanim Latif was just about 12 years old when her father forced her 14-year-old sister into marriage. That was a moment that changed her life.

KHANIM LATIF: And when she left the school and get married, I upset - really upset - and give me a strong pain. I have to change something in my house and inside my family. And I don't let myself and other sister, which we have, to be like her.

KELEMEN: She started reading books about women's rights and became an activist not just inside her family but in her community. At age 45, she now runs a nonprofit called ASUDA, which has a shelter and a hotline for women in need.

LATIF: I'm fighting everyone in tradition, religion, conservative groups set up in the first shelter, independent shelter, which is very taboo in this time.

KELEMEN: Khanim Latif is from northern Iraq, a mainly Kurdish area that's often viewed as a fairly moderate part of the country. But she says she's faced a lot of pressure over the years from religious and community leaders as she protects women and girls from honor killings and helps victims of domestic abuse.

LATIF: To be the activist - to be the activist not belong the rich family, not belong the political party, not belong the famous family, it's very difficult. I built myself by myself.

KELEMEN: Her group is now trying to cope with a massive influx of people fleeing ISIS. They are providing psychological care to women and girls who were held captive by the group. The U.S. has been supporting Kurdish fighters who are battling ISIS, and the U.S. is supporting groups like hers, too.

LATIF: Fighting terrorism group like ISIS is not just about fighting this group. It's about how you'll build your society. And we could not do alone. We need the support from the State Department, from the United States.

KELEMEN: Her award from Vital Voices should help her fundraising efforts here in the U.S. It's also bringing her closer to her sister, the one who was forced into child marriage. She says her sister is more traditional and never liked her activism but did offer her congratulations on her award.

LATIF: Yesterday she calling me and she said, I am proud of you. This make me very prideful.

KELEMEN: Her sister is still married to the same man and has seven children. Khanim Latif says she married late in life and now has a 2-year-old daughter. Michele Kelemen, NPR News, Washington.

npr.org,2016-03-05 00:00:00,' An Imaginary Cartoonist Draws A Very Real Homeland,[],"'Charlie Chan:' An Imaginary Cartoonist Draws A Very Real Homeland

The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye feels like Singapore between two covers. The pressure-cooker country  tiny and polyglot, globally competitive and politically repressive  seems to have been poured into this dense book. As if to make it an even more authentic representation of its homeland, Charlie Chan Hock Chye has met with governmental opposition: Singapore's National Arts Council withdrew a grant from author Sonny Liew because of the book's ""sensitive content.""

Liew seems to have been diligent in assembling all this work by a mid-to-late 20th-century artist. He presents artifacts ranging from shabbily printed comics pages held together with yellowed scotch tape to elegant pencil sketches of people and buildings in Charlie's old neighborhood. Charlie's attempts at portraiture and commercial illustration add intriguing facets. Most remarkable, though, is what happens in the comics across a 30-year period. Their style evolves  or, to put it more accurately, bounds ecstatically  from bold, rounded shapes clearly influenced by Astro Boy creator Osamu Tezuka, to perky animal characters owing a debt to Walt Kelly's Pogo, to stringy musculature and hysterical faces out of EC Comics. There are parodies of Winsor McCay's Little Nemo in Slumberland and an appearance by an obnoxious-looking, brightly colored person who, we learn in one of the many footnotes, is popular Singaporean comics character Mr. Kiasu.

And yet the most persistent feeling in this book is one of disappointment, in people and in Singapore itself. Charlie can't make any money from his work; ""unpublished"" is a constant refrain appended to his most innovative strips. The artist deplores the political failure of 1950s Communist leader Lim Chin Siong, who was jailed without trial for years and kicked out of the country. Charlie clearly believes that if circumstances had been different  if, perhaps, the Communists had managed to negotiate the political rapids more cleverly  Lim might not have been sent into exile as a flower seller and the oppressive People's Action Party, headed by Lee Kuan Yew, might not have cemented a six-decade reign. Liew, meanwhile, seems disappointed in his subject. At the end of the book Charlie is poor and unmarried, unable to scrape together the money for an operation for his sick father. His entire life has been sacrificed to a vocation that never rewarded him. Also, he's imaginary.

In fact, there is no Charlie Chan Hock Chye. Liew created him to be the cartoonist he feels Singapore needs. As Liew sees it, that person must be a versatile genius on a par with  though artistically more adaptable than  the Japanese and American greats. They should be someone who's lived through the most turbulent decades of Singaporean history, a creator who channels seditious political opinions into potent, exciting comics.

It's a tall order. So Liew decided to become that man.

His transformation is virtuosic. First, Liew had to make his book look like a real dossier of an artist's work. His results are perfectly believable. Mixed in with the full-page, full-color comics are unfinished pencil sketches and convincingly dog-eared mockups of Dragon, the magazine Charlie is supposed to have tried unsuccessfully to publish in the 1950s. Someone has even sewed and photographed a little stuffed doll of one of the early characters. The portraits  of friends, family, Charlie himself and, significantly, both Lim and Lee  display Liew's high-art chops.

It's his versatility, though, that's really dazzling. Also enjoyable is his ability to acerbically polemicize Singaporean history stretching back to World War II. As Liew tells it, Charlie was quite radical in his sympathies. Most of the comics provide a mordant take on the issues of the day, using perky children and animals to lambast government oppression. Charlie ostensibly drew a strip in the 1950s and 1960s, the Pogo-esque Bukit Chapalang, satirizing the politics of colonial independence and the short-lived union with Malaysia. Only the first half of the strips were published, according to Liew, but even those seem more controversial than the real-life government would have allowed.

Throughout, Liew advances a consistent critique of Singaporean politics. He's deeply dedicated to the insurrectionist legacy of Lim, suggesting the man occupies a kind of opposite pole from Lee. But the fact remains that one is merely an exiled Communist, while the other led Singapore for decades.

That fact brings a sadness  or rather, another layer of sadness  to the book. For all that it brims over with diverse, colorful creations, it's fundamentally about a lack: the absence of an artist who should exist, but was never allowed to. The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye mourns all the creators who have never been permitted to thrive in Singapore. Liew's own existence seems to be evidence of a change, but only partly. The government withdrew its support from his book, but it didn't ban it outright. That's a kind of progress.

toggle caption Dr. P. Marazzi/Science Source

Medicare is going to test new ways to reimburse doctors for medications, in hopes they'll choose less expensive drugs.

The plan would alter Medicare Part B, which pays for medicines administered in doctors offices or outpatient hospital clinics  to eliminate incentives for doctors to use the most expensive drugs.

The changes would have an outsize effect on cancer doctors and clinics. Medicare Part B shelled out about $7.8 billion on cancer drugs in 2014, or 42 percent of its total spending on drugs that year.

The program now reimburses the doctors or clinics for the cost of the medication plus a 6 percent fee. That means doctors and hospitals earn more money when they use pricier drugs.

As it is now, Dr. Patrick Conway, chief medical officer for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, called the reimbursement structure ""perverse.""

""We've heard from oncologists who feel pressure from their health system to pick higher cost drugs even when they are not appropriate for a patient,"" he said in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday.

The agency plans to test a reimbursement formula that would pay the cost of the drug, plus a 2.5 percent surcharge and a flat fee of $16.80.

Under the current system, a doctor earns just 60 cents for administering a $10 medication. An equivalent drug that cots $1,000, however, would bring in $60. Under the proposed formula, the cheaper drug in this example would generate a payment of $16.93 and the second one $41.80, according to CMS.



CMS officials say that change would mostly eliminate the incentive to choose a high priced drug over one that may be more appropriate. Medicare Part B spent about $20 billion on outpatient medicines last year.

""We're trying to align the incentives to what's best for patients and doctors,"" Conway said.

The Medicare Part B plan would also reduce or eliminate the share of the drugs' costs that patients have to pay.

Dr. Peter Bach, director of The Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, says research shows doctors prescribe higher priced drugs when they bring in more profit.

""It is refreshing to see Medicare move towards an experiment where they pay for drugs using a flat fee reimbursement, where what doctors and hospitals make is related to giving the drug, not how much it costs,"" Bach said in a statement to Shots.

But other cancer doctors aren't so thrilled.

The American Society of Clinical Oncology opposes the CMS proposal. The proposal could have a major effect on oncologists because many cancer patients receive their chemotherapy treatments in doctors offices or clinics.

""It is inappropriate for CMS to manipulate choice of treatment for cancer patients using heavy-handed reimbursement techniques,"" said ASCO CEO Allen Lichter in a statement posted on the physician group's website.

ASCO, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association and about 100 other physician and advocacy groups sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell last week opposing the payment changes.

""We believe that this type of initiative, implemented without sufficient stakeholder input, will adversely affect the care and treatment of Medicare patients with complex conditions,"" the letter said.

The agency plans to field test the new reimbursement formula, as well as a handful of others ideas, in different regions of the country starting later this year. CMS will then compare the results to determine which changes are effective at reducing drug spending.

CMS is also planning to test a handful of so-called value-based pricing ideas. The first would pay for drugs according to how well they work.

For example, if a cancer medication is very effective in eliminating a specific tumor, but is also used on a second, different condition with less success, Medicare will pay less when it is used for the second condition than the first. Sloan Kettering's Bach, who served as an adviser to CMS on cancer policy in 2005 and 2006, argued for varying payments for drugs this way in a 2014 paper published in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association. The approach is called indication-based pricing.

The agency also plans to work with drugmakers to link prices to patient outcomes, perhaps paying less for medications when patients end up being admitted to a hospital.

Private insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been testing similar ideas.

Cigna last month said it had agreed with drugmaker Novartis on a pay-for-performance deal for the heart failure drug Entresto. Under the agreement, Cigna will pay less if patients taking the medication are hospitalized for heart failure.

And Express Scripts, the biggest manager of pharmacy benefits, says it's working with cancer drug manufacturers to pay indication-based prices that tie cost to how well the drugs perform.

The CMS proposal is open for public comment until May 9. Conway said the field tests will begin after the comment period is complete.",[]

i toggle caption Geoff Robins/AFP/Getty Images Geoff Robins/AFP/Getty Images

Tonight the two Democratic candidates  Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders  meet in Miami for a debate.

Before Tuesday night, the debate was looking like an unimportant afterthought to a race that could have been all wrapped up. But not anymore, after Sanders' stunningly unexpected win in Michigan last night.

Here are three things to watch:

1. Delegates or momentum?

Hillary Clinton's campaign says all that matters is delegates and by that measure she succeeded Tuesday night  increasing her delegate lead over Bernie Sanders. But her loss to Sanders exposed troubling weaknesses for Clinton which she needs to address tonight.

How will she try to woo independents (which she lost) and white working class voters (which she almost lost)?

2. Sanders' new lease on life

Just when pundits were getting ready to call him irrelevant, Sanders is now set up nicely for Ohio  another big Rust Belt state that votes next Tuesday.

Tonight in Miami, will he raise the electability question: If Clinton lost Michigan to a Democratic populist in March, why wouldn't she lose Michigan to a Republican populist (Donald Trump) in November?

3. The enthusiasm gap

Republicans keep on posting high turnout levels. Democratic turnout is below 2008 levels.

In addition, the news media are inclined to cover a rambling 45-minute infomercial by Trump  billed as a presidential style news conference  instead of speeches by the other candidates.

If Trump is the nominee and continues to drive ratings, the Democrats might be gasping for airtime this fall.",[]

i LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR

The Internet has not killed the book.

For film critic David Denby, this wasn't immediately obvious. He would watch young people hunched over their phones  on the subway, in coffee shops, walking down the street  and wonder: Are kids still learning to read books?

Denby, who is best known for his work in The New Yorker, went back to high school to find out. He describes his experience in Lit Up: One Reporter. Three Schools. Twenty-Four Books That Can Change Lives.

He followed three high school English classes for a full year: a 10th-grade class at The Beacon School in Manhattan, Mamaroneck High School near New York City and James Hillhouse High School in New Haven, Conn.

Seated on a table in the back of a New York classroom  pushing copies of Shakespeare and Herman Hesse out of the way to make space for himself Denby learned that schools can absolutely still teach kids to love literature.

I asked him to talk about some of his discoveries. Here's our conversation, edited for length:

Why did you only look at three schools, and why did you look at the students in those schools so intensely?

I dislike this American metric prejudice whereby no assertion can be considered of any value unless it's backed up with statistics, surveys, probabilities. Particularly in the education world.

We're talking about young people becoming adults. Becoming themselves. Becoming souls. Becoming conscious. And I don't see how that's measurable.

And I was sick of failure.

I was sick of almost the pornographic reveling in American ineptitude. I wanted to see something that worked.

I didn't want to write a handbook for teachers. I didn't want to write a survey. I wanted to follow one organic development of a class.

I chose Beacon because someone told me about the school. I found that this was a very interesting class because this guy, Sean Leon, was asking students questions that challenged them, I don't know how else to put it, existentially. I mean, they were reading Dostoyevsky and Herman Hesse and Vonnegut, and Faulkner and Hawthorne and so on.

The books that they read tended, with his help, to focus attention to these questions: Who are you? Why do you live? Where are you going? What are you doing?

You know, if you take a typically sarcastic, joking, self-deprecating, media-hip American teenager and scratch him two or three times, you'll find this sort of earnestly questing person underneath. That's what he did.

So, not every school is Beacon ...

Hillhouse is a large inner-city school ... a very different environment.

The kids had strength of feeling and perception. What they weren't, was eager readers.

At the beginning of the year, these were 15- and 16-year-olds, African-American kids, they weren't willing to do the reading at all. The teacher would give them an assignment and they would come in the next day and be blank about it. They couldn't see, particularly the boys, the point of reading in English class. What was it going to do for them?

So that was what Jessica Zylenski, the teacher [at Hillhouse], was trying to engage with and, if necessary, break down.

It's funny to me because, you explicitly said that your book is not a handbook. But the Hillhouse chapters, they do tend to focus on techniques that teachers might use.

The issue always was: How do you get them started?

They read To Kill A Mockingbird, which may seem an odd choice. In other words, they read about poor white people in Alabama in 1930. She wanted them, however, to go from those lives to their own life. From how people lived then to how they lived in New Haven in the 21st century.

So initially they were unwilling to read and they started reading in class together, and then she started moving them to other things. They tried a little Shakespeare. A little Melville. They loved stories by Vonnegut and Hemingway. By the end of the year, they were choosing among four books. And she plunged them into difficult and tragic material because that was what seemed real to them.

I want to pivot back to Sean Leon's class. He always seems to see them right where they are and get them where they need to go.

Well, I know I could never be a teacher.

To be a great teacher, you have to be in touch with what 15 or 20 or, in Sean Leon's case, 32 teenagers are feeling at any one moment.

He has that sixth or seventh sense of where the kids are and how far he can push them. He would plunge into a text, play them off against each other. He never just sat down, laid down the law.

He would pull them out of their defensiveness and get them to perform. Jump from the text and to bring it right into the center of their lives.

I am always bothered by people saying, ""Technology is the worst thing that could happen to the world."" But that's not what you do here.

Exactly. I mean, who am I to say that only literature matters and only books matter? I spent 45 years as a movie critic.

I am addicted to email. I use Facebook and so on. I'm on the Web for all sorts of information. But I also love best to read, and I feel I have to pull back.

He [teacher Sean Leon] was saying you've got to have yourself. You've got to have your family. You've got to have conversation. Movies are fine. The Internet is incredibly useful. But don't think you're going to find yourself there. You may find certain reflections of yourself, but you cannot find your soul there.

In the book, Leon's students wind up doing a pretty good analysis of the hypocrisy of the show Teen Mom. It's almost like he's saying: ""It's fine to be watching TV, but think critically about it.""

I mean, it's an enormously powerful critical tool, reading literature and addressing the world. It's not simple lessons, of course. And it doesn't happen overnight. It's incremental. It happens over your entire life.

Iran's military tested two ballistic missiles Wednesday, and an Iranian officer says the missiles are designed to reach Israel, according to an Iranian news agency. Iran has conducted a number of other ballistic missile tests this week.

The tests, which come after Iran won sanctions relief in January by curbing its nuclear program, seem to be ""aimed at demonstrating that Iran will push forward with its ballistic program,"" The Associated Press reports.

NPR's Peter Kenyon tells our Newscast unit that ""the tests may violate a U.N. Security Council resolution barring Iran from test-firing missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons."" Here's more from Peter:

""Iran says its missiles aren't designed for nuclear weapons. The U.S. says Iran's missile program is not part of last year's nuclear agreement, but Iran has warned that any new sanctions could mean an end to the deal.""

Iran's Press TV has video of the ballistic missile launch on its website. You can watch it here.

As Reuters reports, ""the missile tests underline a rift in Iran between hard-line factions opposed to normalizing relations with the West, and President Hassan Rouhani's relatively moderate government, which is trying to attract foreign investors to Iran."" Additionally, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ""maintains dozens of short and medium-range ballistic missiles, the largest stock in the Middle East.""

Iran denies that this test was ""provocative,"" according to the wire service.

White House press secretary Josh Earnest told journalists that the reported missile launches underscore the importance of the nuclear deal with Iran. ""Iran is working aggressively to try to enhance their ballistic missile capability, and preventing them from being able to nuclearize their missiles is  is obviously important to our national security here in the United States,"" he says.

Earnest adds that it ""would not be a surprise if there are additional launches over the next several days.""

NPR's Michele Kelemen says the State Department and the White House are taking a ""cautious line"" on the missile test. The State Department says ""Secretary of State John Kerry raised this in a phone call with his Iranian counterpart,"" Michele reports.

Hillary Clinton took a harder line than the current administration. She said in a statement that Iran's ""blatant violation"" of the Security Council resolution should have ""consequences."" She adds: ""Iran should face sanctions for these activities, and the international community must demonstrate that Iran's threats toward Israel will not be tolerated.""",[]

Her latest album is Abbar el Hamada (""Across the Hamada"")  Hamada is the word that Saharawi people use to describe the rocky desert landscape along the Western Sahara where tens of thousands of refugees are now stranded.

Tritha Electric

Tritha Sinha, the driving force behind the punk band Tritha Electric, grew up in Kolkata, India, and paid her way through college by singing in Bollywood films. Her Paris- and New Delhi-based band blends Indian classical and folk melodies with '70s-style psychedelic and punk music.

And she's all about girl power. Her latest album, called Pagli (""crazy lady"" in Bengali), tells the story of a woman who feels oppressed by tradition and finds liberation by breaking patriarchal rules.

Muthoni Ndonga aka Muthoni the Drummer Queen aka The Bauss Lady is a big deal in the Kenyan music scene. She's the CEO and founder of a wildly popular monthly music series, Blankets and Wine, which puts on shows in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.

The bio page on her website describes her as a ""living breathing singer of the hero variety,"" and I'd have to agree. Her funky, hip-hop sound features heavily in Nairobi's dance clubs, while her lyrics  in English and Swahili  address issues of social justice and poverty.

In the case of Jeff Buckley, who died at age 30 in 1997 after only a few years of recorded output, the phenomenon is even more pronounced: Because the years leading up to his death have been so picked over, vault-diggers have had to delve ever further into the past, all the way back to early, developmental recordings like 2002's Songs To No One, a batch of songs he'd recorded with Gary Lucas in 1991 and '92. To hear some of Buckley's oldest known recordings now is to watch an already ethereal musician age in reverse.

You And I collects 10 of his demos, which were recorded in February 1993, shortly after he'd signed to his label. For more than 20 years, they sat forgotten in the vaults  and, more to the point, were never bootlegged or otherwise circulated. Newly unearthed, they showcase a late-blooming 26-year-old artist who's still finding and harnessing his voice: learning how to manipulate its gale-force power, learning when and whether to hold back, and learning how to fully translate his influences into a sound of his own.

Most of these songs are covers, and the artists represented help lay out the contours of Buckley's own style: Two of the best (""I Know It's Over,"" ""The Boy With The Thorn In His Side"") are by The Smiths, while Bob Dylan, Sly & The Family Stone, Bukka White and Led Zeppelin help round out a set that also includes ""Calling You"" (written by Bob Telson and recorded by Jevetta Steele) and ""Don't Let The Sun Catch You Cryin'"" (popularized by Louis Jordan, Ray Charles and others). Other anthologies have captured Buckley's love of even clearer influences on his voice  Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, Nina Simone, et al  but the eight covers here still help provide a sense of where his rock and pop influences dovetailed with his love of blues and jazz. (Buckley rarely touched the catalog of his long-dead father, Tim Buckley, whom he famously resembled in both appearance and sound.)

Then there are the two originals: ""Grace,"" written with Lucas, would become one of Jeff Buckley's signature songs, while ""Dream Of You And I"" jots down the barest framework for what would become ""You And I."" That's where this collection is most illuminative. When the final version of ""You And I"" was released posthumously on 1998's Sketches For My Sweetheart The Drunk, it had fleshed out the ideas and sounds explored here  but it was still technically unfinished, which means Buckley spent roughly four years translating an evocative moment from a barely remembered dream into something he still couldn't quite embrace.

That's part of why collections such as this hold so much value: They show how songs breathe and evolve, and help explain how their creation can unfold over the course of many years. Bob Dylan's many archival sets showcase the same phenomenon all the time, but unlike Dylan, Buckley was anything but prolific as a songwriter; he interpreted more songs than he wrote. ""Dream Of You And I"" demonstrates how difficult it is to transform a few hauntingly sung words (""You and I, you and I, you and I / All for you"") into a finished work, while also capturing a few compelling moments of conversation wherein he lays out the song's meaning.

Like so much of Jeff Buckley's posthumous output  nearly 20 years' worth, at this point  You And I was never meant to be heard by the public. Under ordinary circumstances, it'd be little more than a curiosity, trotted out for obsessives only. But as it is, it's another crucial piece of a puzzle that, by definition, can never feel complete.",[]

Alfredo Rodriguez left Cuba for the United States seven years ago. The classically-trained pianist and composer has been mentored and produced by music legend Quincy Jones.

Leaving Cuba opened up the world to Alfredo Rodriguez, and globalism is most of what you hear on his new album, Tocororo. There's flamenco and tango and Bach; there's also an international cast of musicians, most enchantingly the Indian singer Ganavya, who soars over Rodriguez's piano trio on the title track.

What distinguishes Rodriguez's globalism is his ability to both compose and perform into a kind of ecstasy. Like most Cuban musicians, he can handle polyrhythms, and he uses them like a kaleidoscope, combining and shifting meters to bring new reflections and moods to his music.

YouTube

When Rodriguez does look back to Cuba on this album, it's with songs that are not so familiar abroad. The 1990s hit ""Sabanas Blancas"" is a love song to Havana and the emblematic white sheets that hang on its balconies. In Rodriguez's inventive arrangement, his thumping piano groove repeats under the duo Ibeyi's Afro-Cuban vocals.

The music develops parallel to the song's lyrics, gaining force and dimension verse by verse. Rodriguez isn't nostalgically dreaming about home here; he wants to create a musical ritual powerful enough to conjure Havana right there in the recording studio.

Tocororo is equal parts sophistication and sincerity. It's the sound of a prodigiously talented Cuban embracing the wider world of music. Best of all, the album resonates with the possibility of all the other new music we'll discover as Cuba itself opens up to the world.",[]

Sir George Martin, the music producer who signed the Beatles to a recording contract in 1962 and was their intimate collaborator as they together transformed popular music, died Tuesday at the age of 90.

Martin's death was confirmed by Adam Sharp, his manager in the U.K. In a statement, Sharp said:

Sir George Martin passed away peacefully at home yesterday evening, Tuesday March 8th. The family would like to thank everyone for their thoughts, prayers and messages of support.

Martin was often referred to as the ""Fifth Beatle."" He scoffed, but the band wouldn't have been the Beatles we know without him.

Martin's 1979 memoir (co-authored with Jeremy Hornsby) was titled All You Need Is Ears  but his ears, and his instincts as a music producer, were extraordinary.

A classically trained composer, George Martin began to work for the British record label EMI's imprint Parlophone Records in 1950, overseeing classical recordings as well as comedy records by the likes of Peter Sellers, Spike Milligan and Bernard Cribbins.

By 1962, when Cribbins' song ""Right Said Fred"" became a hit in the U.K., George Martin was running Parlophone Records and looking to sign up a rock 'n' roll band. The Beatles auditioned for him in June of 1962.

In a 2011 BBC interview, Martin said: ""They had this wonderful charisma. They made you feel good to be with them. And I thought their music was rubbish.""

Martin signed the Beatles anyway, and came to love their songs. For the rest of the 1960s, he was their closest collaborator, producing almost all of the band's music, playing piano with them, writing their orchestral arrangements and figuring out how to turn John Lennon and Paul McCartney's wilder ideas into records.

In 2011, Martin described how he'd produced one of Lennon's signature songs:

""There was one time on 'Rain' when I decided to play around with tapes, and I took John's voice off as a separate item and put it on a quarter-inch tape and turned it back to front and slid it around a bit and then put it in on the end of the song. And I played it to John when he came back and he said, 'That's gear! What is it?' And I said, 'It's you!' And I explained to him what I'd done. And from that moment he wanted everything backward.""

When he wasn't in the studio with the Beatles, George Martin produced records by British pop acts like Cilla Black, Gerry and the Pacemakers and Shirley Bassey.

In 1977, while visiting the West Indies, Martin fell in love with the island of Montserrat. He built a recording complex for his company AIR Studios there with the money he'd made producing post-Beatles hits like the band America's ""Sister Golden Hair.""

AIR Studios Montserrat was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989, and Martin gradually retired from recording as hearing loss robbed him of his golden ears. His final hit song was the best-selling single of all time: a year after being knighted by Queen Elizabeth II, he produced Elton John's ""Candle in the Wind 1997.""

""As a whole, I've had a wonderful life,"" Martin told the BBC in 1995. ""I've met the most wonderful people, worked with the greatest of artists. I'm very fortunate. I've got no gripes at all.""",[]

i Katherine Du/NPR Katherine Du/NPR

Miss Manners and skilled prep cooks should be pleased: Our early human ancestors likely mastered the art of chopping and slicing more than 2 million years ago. Not only did this yield daintier pieces of meat and vegetables that were much easier to digest raw, with less chewing  it also helped us along the road to becoming modern humans, researchers reported Wednesday.

And our ancestors picked up these skills at least 1.5 million years before cooking took off as a common way to prepare food, the researchers say.

Chewing, it turns out, takes a lot of time and energy, say Katherine Zink and Daniel Lieberman, evolutionary biologists at Harvard University. They recently set about measuring precisely how much effort is required to chew raw food, and to what degree simple stone tools might have eased the toil.

""Every time I go out to dinner, I watch people chew,"" Lieberman tells us. ""And sometimes, I actually count how many times they chew.""

toggle caption John Reader/Science Source

It's not just a hobby. Lieberman's interest gets to some basic questions of how humans evolved.

Scientists have long known that Homo erectus, an ancestor of modern humans who lived about 2 million years ago, had already evolved to have a bigger body and brain than earlier hominins, and would have needed much more daily energy to survive. But the jaw and teeth of H. erectus were much like ours today  significantly smaller and less powerful than those of Australopithecus afarensis, or other hominins of earlier epochs.

A diet that included cooked meat would have provided that ready energy without the need for sharp canines and big grinders. But the research evidence is pretty clear that cooking didn't become common until about 500,000 years ago, Lieberman says. So, how did H. erectus get the needed calories?

To test a long-held hypothesis that simple food processing might be the answer, Zink and Lieberman invited some Harvard colleagues to what Zink calls ""a lab cafe,"" and served them small portions of carrots, beets, jewel yams and goat meat. The food was served variously as roasted or raw; sliced, pounded or left in hunks.

""If I were to give you raw goat,"" Lieberman says, ""you'd chew, and nothing would happen."" Like a lot of wild game, goat meat tends to be stringy, he says. Chewing a big piece makes it more elastic, but it doesn't readily break into pieces.

""But if you cut goat into smaller pieces,"" he says, ""your ability to chew it would improved dramatically.""

All the volunteers (14 for the vegetables and just 10 for the goat meat) wore a number of small sensors pasted to their faces, to detect and count contractions of various muscle fibers as they chewed the bite of food to the point of swallowing. The scientists then translated those contractions into a measure of muscular effort, and also checked to see how well the food was broken up.

Their results, published in the journal Nature, suggest that when eating a diet made up of one-third meat, if early humans pounded the vegetables before eating them, and sliced the meat, they would need to chew 17 percent less often and 26 percent less forcefully than if they started with larger slabs of the food. Every little flex of the jaw and grinding of the teeth adds up: Over the course of a year, Lieberman says, simply having a sharp stone to slice meat would reduce the number of ""chews"" needed by 2.5 million.

""I think it's amazing,"" he says, ""to think that the simple stone tool could have a massive effect on how effectively we chew a piece of meat.""

It's possible, he and Zink think, that the benefits of meat-eating and food processing favored the transition to smaller teeth and jaws.

But it seems more likely, they write in their study, that tool use and meat-eating simply reduced the evolutionary pressure to have big, powerful jaws and sharp teeth, ""thus permitting selection to decrease facial and dental size for other functions, such as speech production, locomotion, thermoregulation, or, perhaps even changes in the size and shape of the brain.""

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Voters delivered a surprise last night. Michigan gave a Democratic primary win to Bernie Sanders.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

He narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton despite polls that showed him far behind. That was just one result on a night when Clinton also won Mississippi, not to mention Republican wins for Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.

INSKEEP: Let's focus for this moment on the Democrats. Margie Omero is with us again. She's a Democratic pollster. And she's on the line. Welcome back to the program.

MARGIE OMERO: Good morning, thanks for having me.

GREENE: And also on the line is John Feehery, who has served as a spokesman for leading Republican lawmakers. John, good morning to you.

JOHN FEEHERY: Good morning.

GREENE: Let me ask you both the same question, if I can. We've sort of enjoyed doing this on nights after voting to try and capture what happened. Margie, can you sum up the Democratic results last night in one sentence?

OMERO: Well, are we surprised by Sanders' gain, or are we surprised more by the polling? Is it more of a polling revolution that we may need to have? And if we look at the reason why, I think one reason could be trade. That certainly came out in exit polls and seems to have been an issue in the last few days before voting.

GREENE: All right. A long sentence, but we'll let you go with that. We look forward to exploring that more. John, what about you?

FEEHERY: Well, I think that it's Hillary Clinton's surprising weakness among African Americans in Michigan and the fact that Sanders had this upset victory. I think it's shocking.

INSKEEP: OK. We'll expand on those sentences in a moment. First, let's hear the candidates and some of their advisers. NPR's Tamara Keith is covering the campaign.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: If elections are about expectations and momentum, then Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders won the night last night. Hillary Clinton won the primary as expected in Mississippi by an overwhelming margin. But Michigan was the biggest prize. And polls leading into the primary had Clinton up by double digits. That's not how it turned out, not even close.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BERNIE SANDERS: I just want to take this opportunity to thank the people of Michigan, who kind of repudiated the polls that had us 20, 25 points down a few days ago.

KEITH: That was Bernie Sanders at almost 11 o'clock last night. He had given a speech hours earlier. But he was back to make a statement after it was clear voters in Michigan were making a statement of their own.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SANDERS: What tonight means is that the Bernie Sanders campaign, the people's - the revolution - the people's revolution that we are talking about, the political revolution that we are talking about is strong in every part of the country.

KEITH: In the final tally, Sanders won Michigan by 2 percentage points, a margin of about 20,000 votes out of a million cast. Exit polls indicate Sanders' message about international trade deals hurting American workers resonated with Michigan voters.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SANDERS: And frankly, we believe that our strongest areas are yet to happen.

KEITH: Sanders' campaign sent out a fundraising email celebrating the win and asking his supporters to pitch in just a little bit more. If history is a guide, this win will help Sanders raise millions of dollars in a matter of hours. And that money will help him compete and run TV ads in the next states on the election calendar - Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri and Ohio.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you so much. Hello, Cleveland. Hello, Ohio.

KEITH: Long before the results were in, Hillary Clinton, her campaign sensing Michigan wasn't going their way, spoke to supporters in Cleveland.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CLINTON: This will be a busy week here in Ohio.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And this campaign is about building a future where every American can live up to his or her full potential.

KEITH: For the Clinton campaign, losing to Sanders in Michigan is a speed bump, one they certainly would rather have avoided. But as Clinton's team sees it, this race isn't about momentum or expectations or even about wins. It's about delegates. And in that respect, Clinton didn't actually lose last night. She pulled further ahead. With her 66-point win in Mississippi and her close second in Michigan, she ended the night winning more pledged delegates than Sanders. As she spoke last night, it was clear that Clinton has one eye on Sanders but the other on Donald Trump.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CLINTON: Now, running for president shouldn't be about delivering insults. It should be about delivering results for the American people.

KEITH: The delegate math remains in Clinton's favor. But Sanders' campaign adviser, Tad Devine, says this is a marathon not a sprint. He described the campaign strategy over the weekend to Politico reporter Glenn Thrush in his podcast called ""Off Message.""

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, ""OFF MESSAGE"")

TAD DEVINE: We're going to try to beat her in pledged delegates. We think we've got until the end of the process to do that. We think we have - it's going to be hard. It's going to be tough. We know we have to win to get it done. But we think we can.

KEITH: And after their stunning come-from-behind win in Michigan, it's a whole lot harder to tell them they can't.

GREENE: All right. That's our colleague Tamara Keith reporting on the Democratic results last night. We were listening here with Republican consultant John Feehery and Democratic pollster Margie Omero. And, Margie, let me start with you. You said a couple things before we started listening to that piece. You suggested this was a polling revolution in Michigan. You also brought up the issue of trade. I mean, what are Michigan Democratic voters saying here?

OMERO: Well, a majority of Michigan primary voters said in the exit polls that they think that trade can hurt U.S. jobs. And you saw that come out in the last Democratic debate. And actually, there's been some really great analysis about website FiveThirtyEight, where that's actually - their views on trade are one of the big differentiators between Clinton voters and Sanders voters. I was surprised to see trade be so salient, frankly. It's something that's pretty complicated and dense and different for every voter and how they experience it. But it may be important, particularly in the Midwest. And this may - the results from last night may portend what we are going to see next week in some of the other contests.

INSKEEP: John Feehery, we had an economist on the program yesterday who pointed out that this is a major dividing issue in both political parties. The elites of each party may be in one place. Their voters may be in another place.

FEEHERY: Yeah, the interesting thing is Trump is kind of the Bernie Sanders of the Republican Party. And that could be a vulnerability for Hillary if Trump gets the nomination. Now, listen, I think Hillary is still going to get the nomination. She's got the superdelegates. She's going to eek this out. But it's not going to be winning pretty. It's going to be winning ugly, as Tad Devine kind of said - acknowledged. And the fact is that trade has become a big issue for both parties. And in the upper Midwest, in Illinois, where I'm from, Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan, you know, this is becoming a big issue for both parties. And I think both parties are going to take heat. I think the other problem for Hillary is she is the political establishment. And this seems to be an antiestablishment year in both parties.

GREENE: John, can I just ask you? You suggested that Hillary Clinton was seeing some weakness among African-American voters. Now, she seemed to do very well with black voters in Mississippi. And in Michigan, I mean, she certainly got a sizable amount of their support. What numbers are you looking at?

FEEHERY: What I was kind of - she didn't perform as well as people thought in Michigan. I think to Margie's point, the polls show that she was going to win Michigan easily. And she didn't get the turnout. And that's - I think Margie is exactly right. She did a trade in Michigan. But a little bit less of an issue in Mississippi, where obviously in the states in the South she's killing it. But in the upper Midwest, it's a real vulnerability. And that actually plays well for Republicans because you think about - Republicans are going to win the South. It's in the upper Midwest where they're going to have problems. And if Trump could be the nominee, that could present some problems for Hillary.

INSKEEP: You also have a fight over working-class voters, white voters particularly. Donald Trump has drawn a lot of of them and gotten a lot of attention. Bernie Sanders has fairly explicitly sought to attract working-class white voters back to the Democratic Party. What do these results suggest about how he's doing? Either of you...

FEEHERY: I think he's doing very well. And I think that - it's interesting that both Bernie and Trump are going for those same voters. And I think that they're doing better than expected in both parties. And it's been a fascinating fight.

INSKEEP: Margie Omero, do you think - I mean, this has been a subject of much debate. Do you think the Sanders voter is similar to the Trump voter? Or are we just kind of conflating two different movements here?

OMERO: You know, I cringe when I hear comparisons between Trump and Sanders. I mean, it's true that both, in the exit polls, show that voters who are particularly angry at the system, are angry at government, are more likely to vote for Sanders. And the Republican Party, they're more likely to vote for Trump. Trump is using just hateful language. I think it's something that Republicans should worry about. I think we should all be worrying about him becoming a nominee and what that means for our political process. Meanwhile, I don't think the same is true. Obviously, the same is not true for Sanders. And Democratic primary voters are much happier with either candidates Clinton or Sanders as their nominee. You don't see that in the Republican Party. There's a lot less satisfaction with any of the candidates being the nominee.

GREENE: Just about a minute left to talk to you both. Margie, let me just start with you. Something we've noticed, a lot of people have noticed. Turnout, much higher on the Republican side in a lot of states than on the Democratic side - is that a sign of more Republican excitement about this election? And are you worried about that?

OMERO: I'm not worried about that. I mean, one, when people make those comparisons, they compare Democratic turnout to 2008. It's higher than many other primaries. And 2008 was obviously different. It was historic for a variety of reasons. Also, the scene is competitive in nearly every state. And that obviously boosts turnout. And also, I think you're going to have a lot of voters who, you know - you have new voters coming on both sides. I don't think that having slightly new Republican voters and elevated turnout in Republican primaries means that they're going to be more competitive in the general. You have candidates on the Republican side who are incredibly unpopular nationwide.

INSKEEP: John Feehery, you've about 10 seconds here on turnout.

FEEHERY: I think the turnout is good for Republicans. The question is the turnout for which candidate? And that's the thing that's troubling. I think Margie's right - Trump and Cruz both trouble, I mean, to be honest with you.

INSKEEP: OK. Thanks very much to you both. Democratic pollster Margie Omero joined us this morning. Thank you very much.

OMERO: Thank you.

INSKEEP: Also, Republican strategist John Feehery, thanks to you.

FEEHERY: All right, thank you.

GREENE: Thank you both.

Steve Inskeep talks to Univision anchor Jorge Ramos about his book, Take A Stand: Lessons From Rebels. Ramos will be one of the moderators at Wednesday's Washington Post-Univision Democratic debate.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Let's meet a journalist who sometimes makes himself part of the story. He's Jorge Ramos. He's an anchor for the Spanish-language network Univision. At a press conference last year, Ramos stood to challenge Donald Trump on his plan to deport millions of immigrants who were here illegally. Trump first refused to call on Ramos and then had security guards remove him.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. Sit down. You weren't called. Sit down. Sit down.

JORGE RAMOS: I have the right to ask a question.

TRUMP: Go back to Univision.

RAMOS: It's the first time in 30 years as a journalist in the United States in which I'd been ejected from a press conference for asking a question. The only other time in which I'd been prevented from asking a question was with Fidel Castro.

INSKEEP: Jorge Ramos was eventually allowed back in at the urging of other reporters. He asked several questions although Trump gave no ground. Early this year Ramos made headlines again. He was the one who interviewed former Mexican President Vicente Fox about Trump's claim that he will make Mexico pay for a great wall on the border. Fox replied...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

VICENTE FOX: I'm not going to pay for that [expletive] wall. He should pay for it. He's got the money.

INSKEEP: Tonight Jorge Ramos is in the spotlight once again. He will moderate a debate among Democrats Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton - a race that once again is intensely interesting. Ramos has interviewed candidates, presidents and other world leaders for decades now. He's about to publish a book about his experience and his view of journalism. It is called ""Take A Stand.""

Do you think of yourself as an advocacy journalist? Is that the right phrase for what you do?

RAMOS: I have been asking if I'm an activist or a journalist. And my answer is very simple. I'm just a journalist who asks questions. The difference is that I'm completely convinced that there are few moments, important moments, in which you have to take a stand as a journalist. When it comes to racism, discrimination, corruption, public lies, dictatorships and human rights, you have to take a stand as a reporter because I think our responsibility as journalist is to confront those who are abusing power. You know, I've been reading a lot about neutrality. Elie Wiesel, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, he says, we must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. In other words, as journalist, I'm completely convinced we have to take a stand sometimes.

INSKEEP: You work through in this book an account of a time that you believed that President Obama was wrong and in fact that you feel he broke a promise that he made in an interview with you regarding immigration reform. What did he say?

RAMOS: He was a candidate 2008. And he said, you know, I cannot promise that I'll propose immigration reform during the first 100 days, but I can do that within one year. And everybody in the Hispanic community call that la promesa de Obama, Obama's promise. And he just didn't keep his word.

INSKEEP: Well, this is an interesting part of this story, though. You assert that that would have made a difference, that had he gone ahead and proposed immigration reform early in his first term that it would have passed. Do you really believe that?

RAMOS: Not only do I believe that, it was so easy to understand. The Senate was controlled by the Democrats. The House was controlled by the Democrats. And they had all the votes. And they waited and waited and waited. If he really didn't mean that he was going to propose immigration reform during his first year in office then he shouldn't have promised that.

INSKEEP: How do you think it has affected your outlook on life that you are one of this very small group of people who can call up almost anybody and talk with them?

RAMOS: You know, I became a journalist - one of the reasons why I became a journalist was because I wanted to be able to talk to the people who are changing the world. And I do learn from powerful people. On the other hand, Oriana Fallaci, the Italian journalist who died recently...

INSKEEP: Right.

RAMOS: He used to say that interviews were a war and that sometimes the interview would win and sometimes the interviewer would win.

INSKEEP: Can you think of an interview where you feel like the interviewee won?

RAMOS: Oh, many times, (laughter) many times. I don't think I win most interviews. For instance, with Fidel Castro, I only spoke with him one minute and three seconds. But I think he won because I couldn't get anything from him. With the former president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, it happened exactly the same thing. And as a Mexican, for me it is incredibly frustrating to talk to the president of Mexico - former presidents of Mexico - because I can't get to them. It is very difficult. On the other hand - I know you'll find this surprising - but it is so refreshing to talk to American presidents because they are much more open than Latin American presidents.

INSKEEP: How many American presidents have you spoken with?

RAMOS: Every U.S. president since George Bush Sr. I have been able to...

INSKEEP: And you found them all relatively open to your questions?

RAMOS: Not relatively open - much more open than to talk to Latin American dictators or Latin American presidents. When you talk to a Latin American president, they make you feel so tiny right from the beginning, right from the moment when they shake your hands. Once I - I'm not going to say exactly in which country - but I asked to go to the bathroom right before the interview and a general followed me all the way to the bathroom...

INSKEEP: (Laughter).

RAMOS: ...And waited outside. But they make you feel you really have no power. And when you have 80 journalists who have been killed in Mexico, for instance, in the last decade, yeah, you realize how lucky we are here in the United States in which you can go to the White House, talk to the president and go back to your house. And then you can take a bike ride and go to the supermarket and no one is going to kill you. No one is going to do anything against you. That's a huge difference.

INSKEEP: So as we're talking, you are preparing for a debate between two would-be presidents - Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.

RAMOS: Right.

INSKEEP: Don't give away your specific questions here. I'm not asking that. But what is the essence of what you want to know from each of those two?

RAMOS: You want to know who they really are and what they believe in. So what I'm going to try to do tonight is to put aside some of the statements that they've said and try to get to know the real candidate, the real person, the person who is behind the candidate, the person who might become the president of the United States. And it's not easy.

INSKEEP: Meaning you might not get them to agree with you but you want to push them to the point were they have to level with you about something?

RAMOS: Exactly, and then if we talk tomorrow and I was not able to put them on the defensive then I didn't do my job.

INSKEEP: Jorge Ramos is the author of ""Take A Stand"" and also of course a longtime anchor for Univision. Thank you very much.

RAMOS: Thank you.

INSKEEP: Jorge Ramos is also moderating tonight's Democratic debate between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.

As we approach the post-2000s future we'd originally imagined for ourselves in pop culture  hoverboards, city-obliterating smog, artificial intelligence, Martian exploration  gatekeepers and storytellers give these once-radical predictions continued life beyond current reality. In Perturbator, James Kent's retro-futurism is violent and surreal, but fully inhabited in his barrage of synths, which help conjure a dark urban future that's as sleek as a lightcycle and as menacing as a machine-gun arm. He says his latest album, The Uncanny Valley, was inspired by the '70s Italian horror film Suspira and the Japanese manga/anime classics Ghost In The Shell and Akira.

Named for the dystopian city in Akira, ""Neo Tokyo"" opens the album in typical Perturbator fashion: Heavy cyberpunk synths deliver savage four-on-the-floors with soaring Gothic melodies. This is where Kent excels, for sure, but here, his sense of texture and composition gives more weight to the finer details. Crank the bass and there's something truly disorienting about those subs, which in lesser hands might just be noise. After a glitching break, a tonal shift occurs that breaks up the darkness for just the briefest moment before giving way to cacophonous strings. Kent's melody is truly woven into ""Neo Tokyo"" in a way he hasn't attempted before, showing the contrast of its shimmering beauty against an industrial wasteland.

Steve Inskeep talks to Univision anchor Jorge Ramos about his book, Take A Stand: Lessons From Rebels. Ramos will be one of the moderators at Wednesday's Washington Post-Univision Democratic debate.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Let's meet a journalist who sometimes makes himself part of the story. He's Jorge Ramos. He's an anchor for the Spanish-language network Univision. At a press conference last year, Ramos stood to challenge Donald Trump on his plan to deport millions of immigrants who were here illegally. Trump first refused to call on Ramos and then had security guards remove him.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

DONALD TRUMP: Excuse me. Sit down. You weren't called. Sit down. Sit down.

JORGE RAMOS: I have the right to ask a question.

TRUMP: Go back to Univision.

RAMOS: It's the first time in 30 years as a journalist in the United States in which I'd been ejected from a press conference for asking a question. The only other time in which I'd been prevented from asking a question was with Fidel Castro.

INSKEEP: Jorge Ramos was eventually allowed back in at the urging of other reporters. He asked several questions although Trump gave no ground. Early this year Ramos made headlines again. He was the one who interviewed former Mexican President Vicente Fox about Trump's claim that he will make Mexico pay for a great wall on the border. Fox replied...

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

VICENTE FOX: I'm not going to pay for that [expletive] wall. He should pay for it. He's got the money.

INSKEEP: Tonight Jorge Ramos is in the spotlight once again. He will moderate a debate among Democrats Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton - a race that once again is intensely interesting. Ramos has interviewed candidates, presidents and other world leaders for decades now. He's about to publish a book about his experience and his view of journalism. It is called ""Take A Stand.""

Do you think of yourself as an advocacy journalist? Is that the right phrase for what you do?

RAMOS: I have been asking if I'm an activist or a journalist. And my answer is very simple. I'm just a journalist who asks questions. The difference is that I'm completely convinced that there are few moments, important moments, in which you have to take a stand as a journalist. When it comes to racism, discrimination, corruption, public lies, dictatorships and human rights, you have to take a stand as a reporter because I think our responsibility as journalist is to confront those who are abusing power. You know, I've been reading a lot about neutrality. Elie Wiesel, the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, he says, we must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. In other words, as journalist, I'm completely convinced we have to take a stand sometimes.

INSKEEP: You work through in this book an account of a time that you believed that President Obama was wrong and in fact that you feel he broke a promise that he made in an interview with you regarding immigration reform. What did he say?

RAMOS: He was a candidate 2008. And he said, you know, I cannot promise that I'll propose immigration reform during the first 100 days, but I can do that within one year. And everybody in the Hispanic community call that la promesa de Obama, Obama's promise. And he just didn't keep his word.

INSKEEP: Well, this is an interesting part of this story, though. You assert that that would have made a difference, that had he gone ahead and proposed immigration reform early in his first term that it would have passed. Do you really believe that?

RAMOS: Not only do I believe that, it was so easy to understand. The Senate was controlled by the Democrats. The House was controlled by the Democrats. And they had all the votes. And they waited and waited and waited. If he really didn't mean that he was going to propose immigration reform during his first year in office then he shouldn't have promised that.

INSKEEP: How do you think it has affected your outlook on life that you are one of this very small group of people who can call up almost anybody and talk with them?

RAMOS: You know, I became a journalist - one of the reasons why I became a journalist was because I wanted to be able to talk to the people who are changing the world. And I do learn from powerful people. On the other hand, Oriana Fallaci, the Italian journalist who died recently...

INSKEEP: Right.

RAMOS: He used to say that interviews were a war and that sometimes the interview would win and sometimes the interviewer would win.

INSKEEP: Can you think of an interview where you feel like the interviewee won?

RAMOS: Oh, many times, (laughter) many times. I don't think I win most interviews. For instance, with Fidel Castro, I only spoke with him one minute and three seconds. But I think he won because I couldn't get anything from him. With the former president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, it happened exactly the same thing. And as a Mexican, for me it is incredibly frustrating to talk to the president of Mexico - former presidents of Mexico - because I can't get to them. It is very difficult. On the other hand - I know you'll find this surprising - but it is so refreshing to talk to American presidents because they are much more open than Latin American presidents.

INSKEEP: How many American presidents have you spoken with?

RAMOS: Every U.S. president since George Bush Sr. I have been able to...

INSKEEP: And you found them all relatively open to your questions?

RAMOS: Not relatively open - much more open than to talk to Latin American dictators or Latin American presidents. When you talk to a Latin American president, they make you feel so tiny right from the beginning, right from the moment when they shake your hands. Once I - I'm not going to say exactly in which country - but I asked to go to the bathroom right before the interview and a general followed me all the way to the bathroom...

INSKEEP: (Laughter).

RAMOS: ...And waited outside. But they make you feel you really have no power. And when you have 80 journalists who have been killed in Mexico, for instance, in the last decade, yeah, you realize how lucky we are here in the United States in which you can go to the White House, talk to the president and go back to your house. And then you can take a bike ride and go to the supermarket and no one is going to kill you. No one is going to do anything against you. That's a huge difference.

i toggle caption Sony Pictures Television Sony Pictures Television

Visiting the set of a historical drama can be a surreal experience, and Underground was no exception.

As the Louisiana sun beat down on an actual historical plantation near Baton Rouge last July, director Kate Woods oversaw a scene where an adorable small boy  actor Maceo Smedley  is picking cotton.

""Could someone go and put more blood on his hands?"" she shouted.

The second the filming stopped, someone dashed over with an umbrella to protect the 8-year-old from the stultifying heat, while the extras playing female field workers pulled bottles of Gatorade and cellphones from their 18th-century skirts.

Underground premieres on the basic cable channel WGN America tonight. It's the first major scripted drama taking the Underground Railroad as a setting. Enslaved people in the American South journeyed hundreds of miles to freedom, assisted by abolitionists, black and white. Given the drama of the actual history, it's almost hard to believe the Underground Railroad hasn't been a setting for a TV show before. (As it happens, NBC also planned a miniseries, called Freedom Run, last year, but it didn't pan out.)

Co-creators Misha Green and Joe Pokaski met while working as writers for the series Heroes, which ran for four seasons on NBC. It was Green's idea to draw on their shared love of comic books and action movies for a show that in some ways would be more 24 than Roots. They wanted to make it exciting and high-stakes, real and relevant.

i toggle caption Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television

Underground is, in the manner of Game of Thrones, a multilayered drama following different groups. Here: slave catchers, abolitionists, a plantation family in Georgia, the enslaved people forced to work there, and those who try to escape. Among them, a housemaid played by actress Jurnee Smollett-Bell. She compares Underground to spy thrillers where characters must rely on cryptic clues to make their way to freedom.

""They could use a star or they could use a song, or they could use code words or glances or markings on a tree,"" she says. The song ""Follow the Drinking Gourd,"" for example, is said to contain coded messages about navigating north by using the Big Dipper.

Other TV shows have dramatized American slavery  but not many. And such shows tend to be miniseries, not regularly scheduled dramas that could air for years. The great Roots, from 1977, was a miniseries. So was BET's critically acclaimed The Book of Negroes, from 2015. (Roots is scheduled for a remake this year.) The PBS series Mercy Street, which debuted this year, is set during the Civil War.

""But slavery is folded within it and not at all its center,"" writes Lisa Woolfork, a professor at the University of Virginia who studies representations of American slavery.

Woolfork says she's heard complaints about ""slavery fatigue"" since the success of high-profile movies such as 12 Years a Slave and Django Unchained. Writers Kara Brown in Jezebel and Demetria Lucas D'Oyley in The Root both recently wrote about it. Woolfork says she wholeheartedly understands wanting to put a shameful past behind us.

""We want to have it safely away so it doesn't impede on our everyday life,"" Woolfork says. ""But one way to understand why our present is the way it is, is rooted in the past. As Faulkner said, 'The past is never dead. It isn't even past.' ""

i toggle caption Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television Skip Bolen/Sony Pictures Television

I hadn't yet talked to Woolfork when lead actor Aldis Hodge and production designer Meghan Rogers took me to Undeground's reconstructed slave quarters outside the Rural Life Museum at Louisiana State University  another exterior set. Seven wooden shacks were arranged around a vegetable garden, all authentic slave cabins from the 1830s that had been moved from another location.

""This was creepy sometimes,"" Rogers admitted.

""Very creepy,"" Hodge agreed. ""The first time on set, all of us, we didn't know where to step, we didn't know how to act, we didn't want to touch anything. You could feel the presence.""

Hodge says that sense of authenticity helped when he had to play very difficult scenes as the leader of the resistance. On one of the first days of shooting, he said, his character had to beg for his life on his knees after being caught.

""Those are the hard days,"" he said. ""It hurts, and there's no way you can come from set without taking a little piece of that with you.""

Filming Underground wasn't just emotionally draining for the actors. It was physically challenging. When Rogers created the set for the abolitionists' house, she built a secret passageways and a bunker where actors playing runaways had to crouch for hours.

""We play a lot of action of people standing on top of people hiding,"" she said. ""You could see a slave catcher standing right on top of someone.""

The production designer was incredibly attentive to tiny details and nuances. For example, she designed the dresses of the plantation housemaids to nearly fade into the wallpaper of the big house, so the women are almost like furniture. And she made the color yellow a motif  the color of freedom. It's the color of a ribbon carried by a runaway, and the color of the lanterns set in the window of the abolitionists' house as a signal.

""Throughout the entire show. I had somebody putting yellow flowers all over the place when they're on their journey,"" Rogers said. ""It's echoing the color of the lantern, the light of the lantern.""

It's fair to say that nothing in Underground is sepia-toned. The music is contemporary, and so is much of the language. Co-creator Misha Green said she aimed to pull American history off the wall of the proverbial museum.

""The Underground Railroad was the first integrated civil rights movement,"" she said. ""And it's a great example of when we work together, what we can go against. Which is 600 miles of crazy terrain being chased by slave catchers to get people to be what they should be in the first case  which is free.""",[]

John Powers reviews a new graphic novel that he describes as an astonishing work of imagination by the Singaporean writer and illustrator Sonny Liew. It's called The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. Our critic-at-large John Powers has a review of a new graphic novel that he describes as an astonishing work of imagination. It's by the Singaporean writer and illustrator Sonny Liew, who was born in Malaysia, studied philosophy at Cambridge University and is best known in the U.S. for his DC Comics series Doctor Fate about an Egyptian-American superhero. His new graphic novel, his biggest and most ambitious work, spans decades. Here's John's review of ""The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye.""

JOHN POWERS, BYLINE: It wasn't so long ago that comics were considered artistically marginal, adolescent fantasy. All that changed with the 1986 release of ""Maus."" Art Spiegelman's graphic novel - as they're now called - tackled the Holocaust and its effect on his family. ""Maus"" won a Pulitzer Prize and unleashed the ongoing wave of masterful books that includes Alan Moore's ""Watchmen,"" Chris Ware's ""Jimmy Corrigan"" and Allison Bechdel's ""Fun Home."" Grappling with everything from sex and politics to violence and alienation, these comics took you places that you haven't gone before.

That happens again in ""The Art of ""Charlie Chan Hock Chye,"" a startlingly brilliant tour de force by the Singapore artist and writer Sonny Liew. Although the premise sounds simple - it's the biography of a fictional comic book artist - what Liew does with it is anything but. At once dizzyingly meta and deeply heartfelt, the book spans 80 years and in its complicated layering remind me of everything from ""Maus"" and ""The Tin Drum"" to, believe it or not, ""Ulysses.""

The book's hero is Chan Hock Chye. His English-language name in a little joke is Charlie. Chan is born in 1938 Singapore. And from the beginning, this shopkeeper's son loves to draw. When he first discovers comic books at the local library, he's forever smitten. He dedicates his whole life to making them, becoming a monk of the craft. Never married, he turns down commercial jobs to spend decades creating comics that don't make money. But while Chan personally leads a quiet, almost invisible existence, his career is shot through with the great drama of history.

He lives through the epic transformation of his tiny island home from a Third World outpost of the British Empire to a sleek country often called the Switzerland of Asia, clean, orderly and so prosperous that its per capita GDP is one and a half times our own. Over the years, Chan experiences the Japanese invasion of World War II, Singapore's messy struggle for independence and the eventual emergence of a seemingly all-powerful ruling party. He watches this skillfully run if sometimes repressive state become a safe haven where billionaires move to stash their cash.

Now, Liew doesn't present this transformation so baldly. We watch it happen by reading the comics that Chan supposedly creates about these events. Of course, Liew himself creates them all, both naive and sophisticated, with dazzling virtuosity. Man, can this guy draw. Giving us a grand tour of comic book history, he works in styles that reference everything from Britain's ""The Beano"" and Japanese manga to Mad Magazine, ""Pogo,"" ""Spiderman,"" even Scrooge McDuck. Every page hums with visual invention, including those pages in which Liew himself turns up, a bespectacled little dude, to comment on the action.

Although ""The Art Charlie Chan Hock Chye"" is probably the greatest work of art ever produced in Singapore, the book was controversial there. It's not a country big on dissent, and Liew points out the cracks in the official myths erected by the party that's ruled for the last half-century. Yet at the same time, he hasn't written a subversive tract or poisoned pen letter.

Even as he regrets the country's missed opportunities, the book is filled with affection, even love. It's a Valentine to cartooning, to old buildings and street food, to heroes written out of official history, to ordinary people trying to make a better life. Most moving and most universal is Liew's portrait of the artist as a young, middle-aged and old man. By today's standards, Chan would be considered a failure. His work doesn't sell. His apartment is modest. And as the country around him grows richer and glossier, he lives in obscurity, all alone, creating comics about a success-mad culture that ignores him.

Near the end, the aging Chan jets to San Diego to attend Comic-Con in hopes of finding kindred spirits and maybe landing some work. The trip doesn't pan out, yet he doesn't let this disappointment stop him. Back home, surrounded by his pens and ink bottle, he keeps doing what he's always done - pursuing his art in the face of a world that doesn't seem to want it. You see, Chan would rather remain marginal forever than give up doing what he cares about most. And Liew makes it heartbreakingly clear that such devotion is one of the highest forms of grace.

GROSS: John Powers is film and TV critic for Vogue and vogue.com. He reviewed ""The Art of Charlie Chan Hock Chye"" by Sonny Liew.

npr.org,,Language To Use And Not Use When Reporting About The Occupation In Oregon,[],"Language To Use And Not Use When Reporting About The Occupation In Oregon

As of Monday, Jan. 4 a.m. 10 a.m. ET:

 We are not using the words militia or militiamen on their own. A militia is organized to resemble an army (Websters New World College Dictionary, Fifth Edition). At most, this group may be called a self-described or self-styled militia. It doesnt resemble an army. Note: Reporting indicates there may only be a dozen or so men doing the occupying.

 We are not calling this a standoff. A standoff requires two sides. Right now, one group is occupying some lands and buildings while the other (the government) is considering what to do. Theres an occupation and it may become a standoff, but its not there yet.

 We have been using the words protesters and armed protesters. But the word protesters is not entirely adequate. These are armed individuals who have occupied government property. They are not simply citizens peacefully expressing their opinions, which is how the word protesters is more often used. This is an armed occupation. They are armed occupiers. They are armed men or armed individuals.

Militants is a better word than protesters. A militant is ready and willing to fight, according to Websters. These men say they are. The dictionary also says a militant is vigorous or aggressive in supporting or promoting a cause.

 As weve previously discussed, its best to avoid labels if possible. Use action words to describe who these people are and what they want. They are an armed group. They want an end to federal management of public land in the west. They are armed anti-federalists who want the states to control public lands in the west (referring to them simply as anti-government is not quite right).

Addition at 1:30 p.m. ET:

When referring to the dispute that Cliven Bundy and others have with the federal government, dont say its over grazing rights. Instead, say grazing fees, grazing privileges, grazing permits or some combination of those words  such as grazing permits and fees.

Its that time of year again, so heres a reminder:

If you feel a holiday cliche trying to tiptoe into your copy, please resist.

From last years post on this topic:

  Tis the season to ... No, it tisnt.   Twas the night before ... It twas?  Over the river and through the woods ... Its been a while since we rode a sleigh to grandmothers house.  Bah, humbug. Be miserly with your references to Dickens.  Oh, the weather outside is ... Dont put that song in my head!  Its beginning to look a lot like ... Not that one either!  Yes, Virginia. No, Korva.  Christmas came early for ... Really? Seems like its always on Dec. 25.  Jing-a-ling. Jing-a-dont.  A Christmas Grinch stole ... Every burglar doesnt have to be be turned into a Dr. Seuss character this time of year.  Santas elves ... Theyre everywhere!  On the Xth day of Christmas ... The song is boring enough as it is.

As we also said last year, you may be able to play around with these holiday evergreens. You might stand one on its head, so to speak.

But the guidance weve given about adjectives applies in most cases to cliches as well: if you see one, kill it.

In other words, say no, no, no, not ho, ho, ho.

There have been times in recent weeks when potentially offensive language  bleeped, thankfully  was broadcast without a discussion beforehand with senior editors. Thats disturbing given the number of reminders that have gone out concerning such language and our policy. It should not happen.

Hopefully the points that follow are clear:

1. We have a detailed Policy On Use Of Potentially Offensive Language. Print it and read it.

2. Any clip with offensive language must be brought to the attention of the DMEs well before air time. Basically, as soon as you think you might be using it, talk to them. They may need time to consult with Legal.

Note: It does not matter if the words have already been bleeped. Be prepared to justify their use. a. By the way, its assumed show executive producers and desk chiefs will already have been consulted.

b. The standards & practices editor should also be flagged.

3. The DMEs have yea-or-nay authority.

4. DACs lines must tell stations the specific language that is in the cut, when it occurs and whether it is bleeped. Those lines must go out with as much lead time as we can give.

5. If the words are bleeped, they must be completely bleeped. No syllable can be heard.

6. We do all this because we respect our audience and know that certain language will offend many. We also know that community standards vary around the nation and that complaints to the FCC can be costly to our member stations.

7. Overall, NPR is conservative about potentially offensive language  not permissive. Theres a key line right at the top of our policy statement: NPR has always set a high bar on use of language that may be offensive to our audience. The words must be important to the piece.

Questions? See Chuck, Gerry or me.

i toggle caption Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist

Thanks to his production work on almost every Beatles album released in the 1960s  up through Abbey Road  Sir George Martin was often regarded as ""The Fifth Beatle."" As a producer and composer, Martin  who died Tuesday at the age of 90  assembled a body of work that spanned more than half of a century and was as varied as it is legendary. Encompassing acts as diverse as Ella Fitzgerald, Cilla Black, The Beatles and Peter Gabriel, Martin was arguably the most successful record producer in the history of popular music.

After accepting a job as an assistant to the president of the small U.K. label Parlophone Records in 1950, Martin was named the label's president just five years later. Thanks to his hands-on working relationship with the artists signed to his label, Martin was able to use his musical gifts to nurture those of the artists with which he worked. In the summer of 1962, he signed an act he described as ""pretty awful"" (at that time); known as The Beatles, the group would go on, with Martin's help, to revolutionize popular music and irrevocably transform the cultural landscape.

After The Beatles split in 1969, Martin worked with Kenny Rogers, Kate Bush, Elton John and Celine Dion, among many others, and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999. Though he ""retired"" in '98, Martin then worked with his son, producer Giles Martin, to reimagine and remix a selection of Beatles music for the Cirque du Soleil show Love. The package serves as a de facto history of popular music, beginning with 1950s big-band material and continuing through the '90s, in the process demonstrating the elder Martin's massive influence on the course of modern popular music.

""The Native American wizarding community was particularly gifted in animal and plant magic, its potions in particular being of a sophistication beyond much that was known in Europe.""

That's what J.K. Rowling writes in the first of a four-part essay series, collectively called History of Magic in North America. ""The most glaring difference between magic practised by Native Americans and the wizards of Europe was the absence of a wand.""

It's just one tidbit from the essay titled ""Fourteenth Century  Seventeenth Century"" and published on the Pottermore website on Tuesday.

The writing is full of details to whet fans' appetites ahead of the November release of the Harry Potter spinoff film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. Set in New York City in 1926, the movie documents the life of wizard Newt Scamander (played by Eddie Redmayne), who wrote the ""Fantastic Beasts"" textbook featured in the Harry Potter series.

For example, Rowling writes that ""while every nationality has its own term for 'Muggle,' the American community uses the slang term No-Maj, short for 'No Magic.' "" The essay also explains the ""legend of the Native American 'skin walker'  an evil witch or wizard that can transform into an animal at will.""

The remaining three parts will publish, one per day through Friday, at 8 a.m. ET on Pottermore. The series will cover magic-related topics in North America, such as the Salem witch trials and other native American legends.",[]

Please use phrases such as secretly recorded and covertly recorded when referring to the videos made by anti-abortion activists.

Undercover is another useful word. True, it may invoke in some listeners minds the image of a government spy who has gone under cover, but as an adjective it means acting or carried out in secret.

We have concluded that sting doesnt apply because it is defined as an elaborate confidence game or an elaborately planned operation engaged in by law enforcement agents to entrap criminals. Those dont fit in this context.

BILL KURTIS: From NPR in WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME, the NPR news quiz. Hey Gladys Knight, forget about Georgia. Take a midnight train to Bill - Bill Kurtis. And here is your host at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Peter Sagal.

(APPLAUSE)

PETER SAGAL, HOST:

Thank you, Bill.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Thank you, everybody. Thank you.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Why, that is some Southern hospitality. We are so happy to be back here at the beautiful Fox Theatre in downtown Atlanta. Later on, we are going to be joined onstage by Georgia native Trisha Yearwood, who went from being an aspiring country singer to one of the biggest country music stars of all time. She's a lifestyle guru, a TV star. We'll ask her when you are that successful, how do you keep writing sad songs?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Still, her last single ""My Private Jet Is So Empty Without You...""

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: ...Still went to number one. We want to hear your complaints, no matter how petty they might be. Give us a call. The number is 1-888-WAIT-WAIT. It is time to welcome our first listener contestant. Hi, you're on WAIT WAIT... DONT TELL ME.

KATE FINLEY: Hi, Peter, this is Kate. I'm calling from Athens, Ga.

SAGAL: Athens, Ga?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: There are some fans here.

FINLEY: (Laughter).

SAGAL: Athens, Ga., known as the Athens of Georgia.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: That's the home of the University, right, University of Georgia?

FINLEY: That's true.

SAGAL: That's true and...

FAITH SALIE: And the home of The B-52's and R.E.M.

SAGAL: That's also true.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Is there anything about Athens you can tell us that we don't already know?

FINLEY: Athens is crazy. There's the university, obviously, the music. And I'm a neuropsychologist here, and I play in a couple bands. And...

SAGAL: Oh, you play in a band? What kind of music do you play?

FINLEY: I play rock, punk.

SAGAL: Oh, I've got to ask, what is your punk band called?

FINLEY: Sex Barbecue.

ROY BLOUNT, JR.: Ooh.

(LAUGHTER)

BLOUNT: Ooh.

SAGAL: Wait a minute - not the Sex barbecue.

FINLEY: The only Sex Barbecue.

PAULA POUNDSTONE: That is a great Southern punk band name.

SAGAL: It really is.

FINLEY: We just put two of our favorite things together.

SAGAL: I think so.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: It makes sense. Kate, terrific to talk to you. Let me introduce you to our panel this week. First up, it's a comedian who will be appearing at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee on March 12, it's Paula Poundstone.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Next, it's a humorist and the author of the new book out this March, I'm really happy to say, ""Save Room For Pie."" It's Roy Blount, Jr.

(APPLAUSE)

BLOUNT: Hey. Hey, Kate.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: And finally, it's a contributor to ""CBS Sunday Morning,"" whose debut book ""Approval Junkie,"" in part about her growing up right here in Atlanta, will be released in April. It is Faith Salie.

SALIE: Hey, Kate.

FINLEY: Hey.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: So Kate, welcome to the show. You know what we're going to do. We're going to start the show off with Who's Bill This Time? Bill Kurtis is going to read for you three quotations from the week's news. Your job, of course, explain or identify to two of them, you'll win our prize - the voice of scorekeeper emeritus Carl Kasell on your home answering machine. You ready to go?

FINLEY: I'm ready. Hey, Bill.

SAGAL: All right, here is your first quote.

KURTIS: ""I love the poorly educated.""

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: That was a man giving a shout-out to one of the many demographics supporting him in his triumphant march to the Republican nomination. Who is it?

FINLEY: That must be Donald Trump.

SAGAL: Yes, that would be his last name...

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: ...Took you a second to remember it. Donald Trump - there is this moment in horror movies - I'm sure you've seen it - where the kids who have wandered into the old mansion on a dare realize that the kindly old man who lives there is really crazy. That's America right now.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: And we're all saying, come on, this isn't funny anymore. Let us out. Now, Trump did promise that with him, we would win so much, quote, ""we'd get tired of winning,"" unquote. Well, now that Donald Trump has won three states, we are tired of him winning. So...

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Now, he said in his speech - he was going through all the people who support him - you know, educated, uneducated. They - all those people who keep voting for him say they like him because he's says what's on his mind, no filters. But filters are good.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Filters are what give us coffee.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: They...

SALIE: Give us good selfies.

SAGAL: Exactly. What would we do on Instagram without filters? They keep your cigarette from killing you instantly.

BLOUNT: Right.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: You know who else doesn't like filters? Cholera.

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: I secretly though would love to see Melania be the first lady, OK, you know?

SAGAL: That would be pretty awesome.

SALIE: Like, she's not going to worry about childhood obesity or literacy. She's going to be, like, my platform is sunscreen.

SAGAL: Her platform is going to be - she wants to be, like, provide liposuction for the upper-middle-class...

SALIE: Right.

SAGAL: ...You know?

(LAUGHTER)

BLOUNT: Once he really lets her hair down and we get to know her...

SAGAL: I think it'll be great.

BLOUNT: ...I'm sure we'll warm up to her.

SAGAL: Now, people have said 'cause...

BLOUNT: Where is she from, by the way, Melania?

SAGAL: She's from Slovenia, I believe.

BLOUNT: Slovenia, oh, I thought...

SAGAL: She's a Slovenian model.

BLOUNT: See, I thought her name was Slovenia and she was from Melania.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: It's hard to tell.

POUNDSTONE: It happens with people from Chad.

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right, Kate, here is your next quote.

KURTIS: (Imitating Southern accent) ""There's not a snowball's chance in hell that's going to happen.""

SAGAL: That was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell saying there's no way in hell the Senate is going to do what?

FINLEY: Approve a nominee for the Supreme Court justice...

SAGAL: That's exactly...

FINLEY: ...by Obama.

SAGAL: ...Right.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: That's exactly right, very good.

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: We also would've accepted anything.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So the Republican Senate, led by Sen. McConnell, says they will refuse to consider any nomination the president puts forward to replace late Justice Scalia. He won't have hearings. They won't hold a vote. They won't even meet with the nominee. What if the nominee stops by anyway? It'll be weird to walk through the Senate office building and see Orrin Hatch standing behind a curtain going shhh...

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: The Senate has never done anything like this before in our entire history. But the Republicans are pointing to something Joe Biden said 20 years ago as support for their position. Dudes, you can find a Joe Biden quote that will support anything.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: It's like hey, why are you jumping off that roof holding a kite in each hand? Well, Joe Biden said it would be cool.

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: Here's the answer...

SAGAL: What's the answer?

SALIE: This is so obvious. Obama should appoint or nominate Donald Trump.

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: This will appeal to Trump's ego.

SAGAL: Yeah.

SALIE: And then the Republicans won't have to worry about him. They can say sure, they can approve the nomination.

SAGAL: Yeah.

SALIE: Put him on the Supreme Court.

SAGAL: Do you want Donald Trump on the Supreme Court?

SALIE: But he'll be surrounded by other people who can buffer the nutterness (ph).

SAGAL: Yeah, or here's another alternative since our government is totally gridlocked, why not just keep Justice Scalia on the bench postmortem?

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: That...

SAGAL: Seriously, think about it. He was old anyway. A little makeup, you staple his robe to the back of the chair so it doesn't slump.

SALIE: And he would still be more animated than Clarence Thomas.

SAGAL: Exactly.

(APPLAUSE)

POUNDSTONE: You know, do you think it's too early for dead Supreme Court-justice jokes?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right - all right, Kate, here is your last quote.

KURTIS: ""The Academy is mainly old white men, so either you wait for them all to die or kill them off slowly.""

SAGAL: That was Emma Thompson offering two alternatives to solving the problem hounding what award show this weekend?

FINLEY: That would be the Oscars.

SAGAL: It would be the Oscars...

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

SAGAL: ...Yes. The Oscars...

(APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: ...This weekend will be the whitest Academy Awards we've had since all the other Academy Awards.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: This is true - the array of Oscar-nominated actors male and female, leading and supporting, is actually less racially and ethnically diverse than the complete roster of GOP presidential candidates.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Now, this happened, this strange whiteout, if you will, happened not because there are no black people in good movies. For example, Michael B. Jordan starred in the movie ""Creed."" You liked the movie. He's a great actor. But he didn't get a nomination for Best Actor, but his co-star Sylvester Stallone got nominated for best supporting actor. Now, it is one thing to lose out to a white guy. It's way worse to lose out to a man covered in what looks like old naugahyde.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: But I really have to say, having no people of color on stage is a shame and unforgivable in terms of...

BLOUNT: Not any...

SAGAL: ...representing the life. Don't you think that, guys, Faith?

SALIE: #WaitWaitSoWhite.

SAGAL: Paula.

SALIE: White White... Don't Tell Me.

SAGAL: Yeah.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Bill, how did Kate do on our quiz?

KURTIS: Well, she did so well, we're going to order three orders of Sex Barbecue.

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: Yum.

FINLEY: Thank you.

SAGAL: Thank you so much for playing, Kate.

""Chug, chug, chug. Puff, puff, puff. Ding-dong, ding-dong.""

The beloved tale of the little blue engine  who helps bring a broken-down train of toys to the good little boys and girls on the other side of the mountain  has been chugging along for a very long time. But despite the locomotive's optimistic refrain  I think I can, I think I can, I think I can  the story has a somewhat checkered past: In its tracks, The Little Engine has left both a legal battle and a debate over whether the little blue engine is male or female.

The exact origins of the plucky, blue switch engine are a mystery. Variations on the tale have been around for more than 100 years.

""Interestingly, the oldest version of the story I could find was published in 1903 in Sweden,"" says Roy Plotnick, who spent 10 years investigating the little engine's back story as a hobby. (By day, Plotnick is a paleontologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago).

Another version he found appeared in a New York newspaper article in 1906 about a church in Brooklyn that had finally paid off its mortgage after 39 years. The article reported on the minister's sermon: ""They had a mortgage burning,"" says Plotnick, and the minister told a parable that is recognizable as a version of the story of the little engine:

He then went to another great engine and asked: ""Can you pull that train over the hill?"" ""It is a very heavy grade,"" it replied. The superintendent was much puzzled, but he turned to still another engine that was spick-and-span new, and he asked it: ""Can you pull that train over the hill?"" ""I think I can,"" responded the engine.

The most familiar version of the tale was inspired by a story called ""The Pony Engine"" and published in a children's magazine in 1916 by Massachusetts educator Mabel Bragg. She added new elements to the story including the broken-down train carrying cargo for kids like toys, peppermint drops, and  every child's favorite vegetable  spinach.

The first time The Little Engine That Could was published as a book was in 1930 with the credit ""as retold by Watty Piper,"" a pseudonym for Arnold Munk, who died in 1957. His daughter, Janet Fenton, was never too fond of the pen name.

""I think it's ridiculous, but he seemed to like it so that's what he used,"" says Fenton.

With all of the different versions of the engine story being told in one form or another, small wonder that Munk faced a legal battle. In the 1950s, a woman claimed that it was her cousin  Frances Ford  who wrote the story in 1910. The details of the case were sealed but Fenton says her father prevailed.

""I don't know if he sued somebody or somebody sued him, but he won,"" says Fenton.

Still, publishers of The Little Engine That Could did agree to let another company print an adaptation of Ford's story under the title The Pony Engine.

Now, to the next controversy: Children who read the story may not think much about whether the little blue engine is male or female. But adults do. If you remember the story, three trains  all male  refuse to help the broken-down engine over the mountain. They are too important, too busy, or too tired to pull an engine full of toys. (""I won't carry the likes of you!"" they said to the disappointed dolls and stuffed animals).

The little blue engine who (after significant cajoling) agrees to help is female  and also self-deprecating. ""They only use me for switching trains in the yard. I have never been on the other side of the mountain,"" she protests.

My colleague Beth Novey says that The Little Engine That Could was ""leaning in"" long before Sheryl Sandberg was. Francesco Sedita, president of the Penguin division that publishes The Little Engine That Could, likes the characterization.

She was ""literally the first to lean in! She really is the poster engine of the can-do attitude,"" says Sedita.

Now, over the years, some versions of the little blue engine have been male. And some folks have gotten pretty steamed over the issue. When the engine is a ""she,"" people have assumed the gender was changed to make the story politically correct. But in fact, she was a ""she"" as early as 1930.

Blogger Lara McKusky argues that the little blue engine is a do-it-all, Supermom martyr who is pressured into pulling more than she signed on for  while male trains had no problem setting boundaries and saying no.

Whatever your views on the little blue engine  male or female  the idea of a small train beating the odds through sheer will and determination is so old and so recognizable, it just had to be parodied. In 1976, Saturday Night Live did a bit about a little engine who has a heart attack and dies.

NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Somini Sengupta, the former New Delhi bureau chief for The New York Times, about her book, The End of Karma: Hope and Fury Among India's Young.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Somini Sengupta left India as a young child in 1975. Thirty years later, she returned as the New Delhi bureau chief for The New York Times. The 21st century country she found as a journalist was nothing like the one her parents grew up in. Today, India is youngest country in the world with 365 million people between the ages of 10 and 24. A million turn 18 every month.

SOMINI SENGUPTA: They join the labor force. They register to vote. They embrace the Internet, many of them for the first time. They fall in love. And all those things change their own country profoundly.

SHAPIRO: It's a country with a democratic government, a country with constitutional guarantees. And that means it's a country with enormous expectations and challenges.

SENGUPTA: One is how to level the playing field so that there's at least some equality of opportunity for both men and women and, I would argue, particularly women who have really not enjoyed the equality that the Constitution of India had promised them 70 years ago. And the other related challenge is how much to let this generation speak their mind. India has always had a very ambivalent relationship with free expression, and that is all the more pronounced now during the Internet age.

SHAPIRO: Somini Sengupta follows seven young people and their aspirations in her latest book, ""The End Of Karma: Hope And Fury Among India's Young.""

SENGUPTA: I call this ""The End Of Karma"" because the people I write about - they're all trying to overcome their past. They were born with one destiny. They are trying to make another. And they're all stories of incredible grit and resilience and great hope but also a bit of fury - quite a bit of fury, which is why the subtitle of the book is ""Hope And Fury Among India's Young.""

SHAPIRO: And this idea of trying to overcome your past - how new is that for India - that your past is not necessarily destined to be your future.

SENGUPTA: I'll tell you the story of one child who I met in reporting this book. Her name what's in reporting this book. Her name is Varsha (ph). She was the daughter of what's known as a presswala (ph). Her family had a business pressing clothes at the end of a block under a tree. And ever since Varsha was a small girl, she would go around collecting the rumpled bundles of clothes, and she would help her parents pressing them - saris and salwar kameezes and button-down shirts. And the one thing she didn't want to be was a presswala or a presswala's wife. And she really, really wanted to be a cop, a policewoman.

And her father, who was her great champion, was also very much against this idea. He wanted to marry her off to a good family, and he couldn't bear the idea of her being a policewoman. So the story of Varsha is really the story of a girl who tries to overcome her past, who tries to grow wings and a story of a father who has to decide how far he will let her go.

SHAPIRO: Do you expect that five years from now she'll be a police officer or a presswala or something else?

SENGUPTA: I think it depends largely on how hard Varsha is willing to push. She has already pushed her father to go quite a mile. Her father did not want her to even finish high school or go to college. He was very nervous about what would happen to her, and she's managed to push him ever so steadily just by dint of determination and resilience. But she has also had to tamp down her dreams every step of the way.

SHAPIRO: So many of the stories in this book reminded me of stories we hear about early 20th century America. And almost the minute that thought entered my head, (laughter) I reached the sentence you wrote, this country is not a country of Horatio Algers, referring, of course, to the quintessential story of transcending destiny in early 20th century America. So while many of the stories do follow this model that the U.S. seems to have followed a hundred years ago, you're saying, no, there's a big difference here.

SENGUPTA: Well, I think the myth of Horatio Alger has increasingly been shown to be a myth even in our own country. But I think you're absolutely right that the parallels between India and the United States are just remarkable. India was a very unlikely country at its birth in 1947. It was made up of a bunch of different ethnicities, a lot of different languages. And frankly, there were a lot of naysayers who said there's no way that a country that is so poor, that is so diverse is ever going to hold together.

It did hold together, and it has made some remarkable gains since independence. My parents, who were born during the independence era - they're called midnight's children. In their time, life expectancy was 32, and today, it's 66. In their time, infant mortality rates were sky high, and now it's diminished remarkably. In my father's time, when he went to school, there were fewer than half of all Indian children who were enrolled in school. They certainly didn't include dalits or outcasts. They certainly didn't include many girls. And today, nearly all Indian children are in school.

SHAPIRO: Your parents, who, as you say, came of age in the era of Indian independence, were known as midnight's children, a phrase made famous by Salman Rushdie in his novel. You call this young generation noonday's children. Explain what that means.

SENGUPTA: This generation of Indians, because their expectations are so high, they are so demanding and so restive in many ways that I think of India at this moment as a country at high noon. And I'll tell you one story. I remember going out to a school in rural India in a state called Bihar. And it was wintertime, and it was early in the morning. It was a bright, sunny, crisp morning. The mist was rising from the fields. And all these children were just streaming into school, carrying these empty rice sacks because that's what they would sit on. There was not enough chairs or tables or benches for them, and so they would spread them out on the floor, on the grass outside of school, and they would try to get an education.

Now, I went there with a remarkable Indian NGO called Bhutan. They were trying to assess what children were actually learning in school. And as it turned out, half of all fifth-graders couldn't read a basic sentence. Half of all fifth-graders couldn't subtract. And these were children who had been in school for five years. And I'll never forget what one of the social workers who I accompanied - he said to me, you know, when these children grow up, they'll curse us. They'll say, we came to school, and we learned nothing.

SHAPIRO: And your commitment to these people whose stories you tell really comes across in the book where, again and again, I was struck by the number of times you would follow up with a 14-year-old as a 17-year-old (laughter) or an 18-year-old as a 21-year-old, not just tracking their stories but perhaps giving them career advice and helping provide perspective. You come across as very, very invested in these stories.

SENGUPTA: Well, thank you. I did get pretty close to all of these young people, some more than others. And I have to say, I had to resist giving the girl that I described earlier, Varsha - I had to resist giving her too much career advice because I did, at one point, consider giving her the form - the application form to fill out for the Indian Police Service. And then I stopped myself. I thought, well, you know, that's for her to do.

SHAPIRO: Somini Sengupta covers the United Nations for The New York Times, and her new book is called ""The End Of Karma: Hope And Fury Among India's Young"" - great talking to you. Thank you so much.

SENGUPTA: Thank you, Ari.

In 1962, George Martin signed an unknown band: The Beatles. Steve Inskeep talks to Ray Connolly, who made a documentary series with Martin called The Rhythm of Life, about Martin's death at age 90.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

We are remembering Sir George Martin, who died yesterday at the age of 90. In 1962, while working for a British record label, he signed an unknown band called The Beatles. We're going to talk now with author and filmmaker Ray Connolly, who interviewed The Beatles many times and also made a documentary series with George Martin about music called ""The Rhythm Of Life."" Welcome to the program, sir.

RAY CONNOLLY: Good morning.

INSKEEP: Producer can be so many things for a musical group. What was Martin's job, really, with The Beatles?

CONNOLLY: He was the arranger. When they'd bring a song in, he's listen to it and say, well, you know, this is - this is OK. But have you thought about doing it in four-four time or maybe doing three-four time? That sort of thing - and then he would add all these instruments. He would sort of say, well, you know, that's great. But what else can you do? And then The Beatles would sort of throw out ideas themselves. So they would work in very, very close collaboration. The great thing about it was that George Martin knew everything there was to know about classical music. The Beatles knew whatever there was to know about rock n roll but nothing about classical music. So you put the two together - fantastic symbiosis. And so George took The Beatles from just rock n roll to ""Penny Lane,"" ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" ""Sgt. Pepper.""

INSKEEP: And added sophistication to the music, I would imagine.

CONNOLLY: Absolutely.

INSKEEP: What you're describing is the role of an editor, really, which can be psychologically challenging for the artist because Martin is the guy telling you your song is not right or your song is not complete. They must have really trusted him.

CONNOLLY: Well, yeah, at first, you know, they would do whatever he said because, you know, he was the boss. He was like a schoolteacher. And that's the way he came across all the time. He was like a schoolteacher. And he helped them. And then later on, of course, they wanted to have more say. In the end, when they finished - when they finished recording together, John Lennon - and actually John was being a bit mean about this. He kind of said, well, you know, we want to do it ourselves now. They weren't as good without George Martin.

INSKEEP: Did they resent it a little bit when there were stories suggesting that Martin was the guy who was...

CONNOLLY: Yeah, I think they did. I think John did. But then later on, he and George got together. And I remember George telling me how he'd been talking to John. And John had said, I wish I could record the songs again. George said, well, which songs, John? He said, all of them. But with George Martin doing it, you know.

INSKEEP: Oh, my goodness.

CONNOLLY: He was that important, you know.

INSKEEP: And when you listen to Beatles music, is there something - or anybody's music, really - is there something that causes you to say, that's George Martin? That's George Martin in there.

CONNOLLY: I can certainly do it on Beatle records because I know exactly what he did. On ""Penny Lane,"" played piano - he introduced the piccolo and the trumpet (ph), things like that. You know, if The Beatles hadn't met George Martin, they'd have been a fantastic rock 'n' roll band. Because they met George Martin, who would take them, you know, in other directions, they were much more interesting.

INSKEEP: Can I just mention there's something about Beatles music that feels timeless? There's so much music from the '60s that might be great music. But it's music from the '60s. The Beatles' music feels a little different to me. Was that George Martin's influence, particularly that classical music influence you mentioned?

CONNOLLY: I think it was partly that. I think, you know, rock 'n' roll is - it's American music. The Beatles took it further. And they made it English music - very, very English music. So you know, I mean, songs like ""Penny Lane,"" they are very English. And that's partly George too. I mean, when Paul sang ""When I'm 64,"" that was like an old-time English musical song. Well, George know how to do it, you know? Paul would say, well, what about this? And George would say, well, hang on. I've got an idea. At Abbey Road where they recorded, there was this sort of band room and these old instruments there. And the boys would bring things out and say, what does this sound like? And George would say, well, you can do this and do that with it, you know? Add a harpsichord here. Add this. Add that - you know? - fantastic.

INSKEEP: You said another interesting thing I hadn't thought about. We think of this British group that grabbed an American music style and even played, you know, old American tunes on some of their early records.

CONNOLLY: Yeah.

INSKEEP: But you're saying that Martin was the one who made them what they really were.

CONNOLLY: I think he was. I think he was. And I mean, The Beatles may say, no, we could do it without him. But I doubt it. I think George brought a hell of a lot to them.

INSKEEP: Author and filmmaker Ray Connolly, who knew George Martin for many years. Thanks very much.

CONNOLLY: You're welcome.

npr.org,2016-03-09 00:00:00,'What Is Not Yours' Is Flawless,[],"'What Is Not Yours' Is Flawless

Most writers would give everything they own to have just one masterpiece to their name. British author Helen Oyeyemi is barely 31, and she already has at least three of them. That includes her last two novels, Mr. Fox and Boy, Snow, Bird, both of which received extensive critical acclaim in the U.S. and around the world.

It also includes her latest book, the short story collection What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours. The book contains the same sly humor, gorgeous writing and magical characters as her previous efforts. It is, in a word, flawless.

The nine stories in the book are mostly linked  characters in early stories show up in later ones, to wonderful effect. And the stories are all joined thematically; each one has a lock or key as a significant plot point. The result is that the book feels like a novel, but one that moves freely through time and geography.

The collection opens with ""Books and Roses,"" a remarkable love story about Montserrat, a foundling girl left in a Catalonia chapel with a key hanging around her neck. She grows up and finds work in a laundry, where she encounters Senora Lucy, a painter who also wears a key. Montserrat eventually discovers that she and Lucy are linked when she finds the lock that fits her key. Her reaction is bittersweet: ""She'd carried the key to this place for so long and now that she was there she didn't know where she was.""

In ""'Sorry' Doesn't Sweeten Her Tea"" (Oyeyemi clearly has a gift for great titles), sisters Day and Aisha, who are being raised by their father and his boyfriend, deal with the news that their favorite singer has been accused of savagely beating a woman. Day returns later in the funny, deeply sweet ""A Brief History of the Homely Wench Society,"" as a member of the titular club, formed at Cambridge University as an answer to an all-male student association.

Aisha, as well as some other characters from previous stories, is featured in ""Freddy Barrandov Checks ... In?"", about a young man being pressured to work in the hotel that employs his parents. Freddy is resistant to the idea: ""She wants to see good hearts and good brains put to proper use, but I'm not convinced that everybody ought to live like that, or even that everybody can.""

Oyeyemi seems to be incapable of writing anything that's not wholly original. ""Is Your Blood As Red As This?"" follows the lives of students at a bizarre puppetry school; one character is a ghost, and another, Rowan, is a ""wooden devil"" in genderless human form. ""No matter how soft his skin appears to be he is entirely wooden, and it is not known exactly what animates him  no clock ticks in his chest,"" Oyeyemi writes. ""His fellow students already had all those confusing hormone surges to deal with. So most of them stayed away, though I'm sure they all dreamed of him, her, hir, zir, a body with a tantalizing abundance of contours, this Rowan who is everything but mostly tree.""

It's one thing to write so beautifully about youth and desire; it's another thing entirely to do it in such a vividly imagined, unique setting. Oyeyemi manages to make the story both realistic and fantastical, and the characters are rendered with grace and compassion.

You could say the same thing for every story in What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours, from the subtle ""Presence"" to the chilling ""If a Book Is Locked There's Probably a Good Reason for That Don't You Think."" And even in the darkest moments of the book, Oyeyemi never loses her sense of humor  as one character notes, ""Sometimes I dream I'm falling, and it's not so much frightening as it is tedious, just falling and falling until I'm sick of it, but then a noose stops me short and I think, well, at least I'm not falling anymore.""

What Is Not Yours Is Not Yours is a lot of things: dreamy, spellbinding, and unlike just about anything you can imagine. It's a book that resists comparisons; Oyeyemi's talent is as unique as it is formidable. It's another masterpiece from an author who seems incapable of writing anything that's less than brilliant.",[]

Republicans continued to post stunning voter-turnout numbers Tuesday night. In the four states that voted on the GOP side, turnout far exceeded what the party saw in 2012.

In Hawaii's, Michigan's and Mississippi's Republican races, turnout this year was 30 to 40 percent higher than it was in 2012. Idaho posted a nearly 400 percent bump, but that may be due in part to the fact that this year was a primary, whereas the party held a caucus in 2012; those contests tend to draw smaller crowds.

Democrats' numbers likewise require some context. In Michigan, this year's turnout far outstripped that in the state's 2008 contest. But then, in 2008, Barack Obama and John Edwards both bowed out of Michigan's race when the state broke party rules and scheduled its primary too early. That may have helped depress turnout.

Add together the 23 states where Republicans have voted or caucused this year, and you get 12.4 million people. That's nearly 5 million more GOP voters thus far this primary season than in those same states in 2012  a bump of nearly 67 percent across those states.

Contrast that with the Democratic side, whose turnout dropoff is nearly a mirror image of the GOP's spike, with nearly 8.7 million people voting thus far across 21 states' Democratic contests. That's down by nearly 23 percent from the party's stellar turnout in 2008.",[]

npr.org,2014-07-28 00:00:00,Tales Of Migration Explore Modern-Day Odysseys And 'Hyphenated Identities' : Code Switch : NPR,[],"Tales Of Migration Explore Modern-Day Odysseys And 'Hyphenated Identities'

For many writers, the migrant's journey is a storytellers' dream. The transition from one part of the world to another is filled with anticipation, conflict and inherent literary drama. While trains and planes become the mundane means of transportation for most travelers, those trips can herald life-changing transformations for a migrant remaking his or her life through that journey.

Novelist Amitav Ghosh is finishing an epic trilogy of novels  Sea of Poppies, River of Smoke, Flood of Fire  set at sea in the midst of the Opium Wars of the 19th century. They're filled with countless characters from around the world navigating the stormy seas in search of better lives.

The novels examine questions of empire, power and class, but the real star of Ghosh's books is an old-fashioned sailing ship named the Ibis. The former slave ship begins its journey in Baltimore and sails around Africa, onto India and China after it's bought by a British merchant living in Calcutta. As the Ibis docks in ports around the world, a global cast of characters assembles on board  which allows Ghosh to craft a kaleidoscopic portrait of characters.

""The journeys of the people who've come there are themselves so interesting,"" Ghosh says. ""What brings people into this very enclosed space  people with such different histories and experiences  all of that creates endless possibilities."" Beyond the literary possibilities, Ghosh says that convergence of identities echoes the way modern migration has brought so many people together.

""Every ship was in a sense a microcosm of the world,"" says Ghosh, who was inspired by Herman Melville's Moby Dick. ""This is one of Melville's great themes ... how completely different kinds of people are thrust together and how very often their roles just completely change.""

Change is also at the heart of Yann Martel's best-selling novel Life of Pi and its Oscar-winning film adaptation. An Indian boy sailing to Canada with his family survives a shipwreck. He's lost at sea on a lifeboat with a tiger. They must learn to coexist, and they forge a community of survivors.

""The notion of shipwreck in the Life of Pi I think is a perfect metaphor for the experience of exile,"" says Reza Aslan, a best-selling author and editor of the anthology Tablet and Pen. ""Being adrift, looking for a land to call home, that's an experience that I myself have experienced as an exile from Iran,"" he says.

Aslan says Life of Pi shows how the immigrant's journey leaves an individual unmoored  how it throws an identity into flux.

The idea of how immigrants reconcile their past with the future inspired Jhumpa Lahiri's novel The Namesake, which also became a film. In it, a father survives a traumatic train accident as a young man in India.

""We have to go through that darkness, through that chaos and confusion, in order to ... ultimately figure out that the person we are today still has fragments of the person we were before we immigrated,"" says Ilan Stavans, professor of literature at Amherst College and editor of the anthology Becoming Americans. ""What immigrant writers have done in American literature is shown us that America is a microcosm of the world  that all cultures converge here  that we have connections, tentacles to the rest of the world, and that we are a society in constant movement.""

That movement is very much in the headlines today, and it was the subject of Sonia Nazario's Pulitzer Prize-winning Enrique's Journey. Nazario followed a young boy from Honduras searching for his mother in the United States.

""He travels the only way that he can  with little or no money  which is gripping onto the tops and the sides of these freight trains that travel up the length of Mexico. It's a modern-day odyssey that these children go on.""

It's a book of reporting written with a novelist's eye. ""There were gangsters that controlled the train tops,"" Nazario says. ""I would see these guys  they would roam from car to car and surround a group of migrants and say, 'Your money, or your life'  and strip you of your clothes, look for any coins they can find, and sometimes hurdle you down to the churning wheels below.""

Reza Aslan says part of what's fueling the stories of migration are a new generation of writers with roots in multiple parts of the world. ""When you have these writers who have these hyphenated identities,"" he says, ""they have the ability ... to draw from those cultures and to really get at the heart of what literature is about  how we as human beings navigate an indeterminate world; how we understand our place in this planet.""

More From The Book Your Trip Series For more great car tales, check out NPR's Book Your Trip series. We've got recommendations for literary travel by train, plane, car, bike, boat, foot, city transit, horse, balloon, rocketship, time machine and even giant peach.

And ultimately these stories of migration aren't really about the external journey. ""It doesn't matter the mode of transportation  whether by foot or by camel or by car or by plane,"" says Aslan. ""It doesn't matter the destination, and even the journey itself is secondary to the transformation that occurs in the individual making the journey.""

And even for the individual sitting still, reading about those journeys can become its own means of transformation.",[]

No, me neither, because I've been busy reading their compact, torn, slightly damp (how did it get that way?) board book to my own budding geniuses. Spoiler alert: Harold, a mere child, has left his bedroom. Don't worry. He ""think[s] it over for some time."" What's more, he has gone by way of an oversized purple crayon. Here's the thing you might not remember about Harold if a short human hasn't sat on your lap in a while  he gets into some real scrapes. Sure, there are the unlimited pies, and a trip to the big city, but there's also a dragon, a near drowning and a quick descent off a mountain. And here's the best part: Everything that scares Harold is something he created  that dragon may be terrifying but it's the dragon he hath made. Harold draws the sea that swallows him and the boat that saves him. And when he gets home again  who can be sure that the bedroom he's drawn, with the moon in the window, is the same one he left? It isn't, really  and that's OK. It's still home  even when something's changed  even when you've changed. And of course, the question that still haunts me: Is Harold going to step on the crayon when he wakes up? That purple's going to leave a mark on the carpet. (For ages 3 to 7)

In 1962, George Martin signed an unknown band: The Beatles. Steve Inskeep talks to Ray Connolly, who made a documentary series with Martin called The Rhythm of Life, about Martin's death at age 90.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

We are remembering Sir George Martin, who died yesterday at the age of 90. In 1962, while working for a British record label, he signed an unknown band called The Beatles. We're going to talk now with author and filmmaker Ray Connolly, who interviewed The Beatles many times and also made a documentary series with George Martin about music called ""The Rhythm Of Life."" Welcome to the program, sir.

RAY CONNOLLY: Good morning.

INSKEEP: Producer can be so many things for a musical group. What was Martin's job, really, with The Beatles?

CONNOLLY: He was the arranger. When they'd bring a song in, he's listen to it and say, well, you know, this is - this is OK. But have you thought about doing it in four-four time or maybe doing three-four time? That sort of thing - and then he would add all these instruments. He would sort of say, well, you know, that's great. But what else can you do? And then The Beatles would sort of throw out ideas themselves. So they would work in very, very close collaboration. The great thing about it was that George Martin knew everything there was to know about classical music. The Beatles knew whatever there was to know about rock n roll but nothing about classical music. So you put the two together - fantastic symbiosis. And so George took The Beatles from just rock n roll to ""Penny Lane,"" ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" ""Sgt. Pepper.""

INSKEEP: And added sophistication to the music, I would imagine.

CONNOLLY: Absolutely.

INSKEEP: What you're describing is the role of an editor, really, which can be psychologically challenging for the artist because Martin is the guy telling you your song is not right or your song is not complete. They must have really trusted him.

CONNOLLY: Well, yeah, at first, you know, they would do whatever he said because, you know, he was the boss. He was like a schoolteacher. And that's the way he came across all the time. He was like a schoolteacher. And he helped them. And then later on, of course, they wanted to have more say. In the end, when they finished - when they finished recording together, John Lennon - and actually John was being a bit mean about this. He kind of said, well, you know, we want to do it ourselves now. They weren't as good without George Martin.

INSKEEP: Did they resent it a little bit when there were stories suggesting that Martin was the guy who was...

CONNOLLY: Yeah, I think they did. I think John did. But then later on, he and George got together. And I remember George telling me how he'd been talking to John. And John had said, I wish I could record the songs again. George said, well, which songs, John? He said, all of them. But with George Martin doing it, you know.

INSKEEP: Oh, my goodness.

CONNOLLY: He was that important, you know.

INSKEEP: And when you listen to Beatles music, is there something - or anybody's music, really - is there something that causes you to say, that's George Martin? That's George Martin in there.

CONNOLLY: I can certainly do it on Beatle records because I know exactly what he did. On ""Penny Lane,"" played piano - he introduced the piccolo and the trumpet (ph), things like that. You know, if The Beatles hadn't met George Martin, they'd have been a fantastic rock 'n' roll band. Because they met George Martin, who would take them, you know, in other directions, they were much more interesting.

INSKEEP: Can I just mention there's something about Beatles music that feels timeless? There's so much music from the '60s that might be great music. But it's music from the '60s. The Beatles' music feels a little different to me. Was that George Martin's influence, particularly that classical music influence you mentioned?

CONNOLLY: I think it was partly that. I think, you know, rock 'n' roll is - it's American music. The Beatles took it further. And they made it English music - very, very English music. So you know, I mean, songs like ""Penny Lane,"" they are very English. And that's partly George too. I mean, when Paul sang ""When I'm 64,"" that was like an old-time English musical song. Well, George know how to do it, you know? Paul would say, well, what about this? And George would say, well, hang on. I've got an idea. At Abbey Road where they recorded, there was this sort of band room and these old instruments there. And the boys would bring things out and say, what does this sound like? And George would say, well, you can do this and do that with it, you know? Add a harpsichord here. Add this. Add that - you know? - fantastic.

INSKEEP: You said another interesting thing I hadn't thought about. We think of this British group that grabbed an American music style and even played, you know, old American tunes on some of their early records.

CONNOLLY: Yeah.

INSKEEP: But you're saying that Martin was the one who made them what they really were.

CONNOLLY: I think he was. I think he was. And I mean, The Beatles may say, no, we could do it without him. But I doubt it. I think George brought a hell of a lot to them.

INSKEEP: Author and filmmaker Ray Connolly, who knew George Martin for many years. Thanks very much.

CONNOLLY: You're welcome.

Martin, who died yesterday in London, was among the earliest to recognize The Beatles' talents and is often credited with helping them develop their sound. Originally broadcast in 1980.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. We're going to remember George Martin, the British record producer who's credited with helping The Beatles develop their sound. He died yesterday at age 90. Martin produced 13 Beatles albums between 1962 and 1970. He offered advice, created arrangements and helped them execute their unconventional musical concepts. Before working with The Beatles, he'd produced pop and comedy albums as well as symphonic and choral recordings. Martin was a classically trained musician and was the first to encourage The Beatles to use orchestral musicians on their records. I spoke to George Martin in 1980, back when FRESH AIR was a local radio program in Philadelphia. He told me that when he first started working with The Beatles, he wasn't sure about their songwriting skills.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

GEORGE MARTIN: They showed no evidence of being great writers to begin with - in fact, they weren't. After ""Love Me Do,"" I was convinced that they were a hit group, but I knew I had to find a hit song for them. And I was scrabbling around all the publishers looking at the material, and I eventually found something that I thought was good. And I gave it to them. I said, look, we're going to record this, and with this you'll make your fame and fortune. This will be a No. 1, I promise you. They obviously weren't too keen on it. It wasn't their song, but they did it. They had to. And the song was called ""How Do You Do It?""

And they made a very - well, quite a credible record of it. I've heard it recently. It's not bad at all. But at the end of it, they said, look, we don't really want to record other people's material for singles anyway. We don't mind putting one on our albums, but can we do one of our own? And I said smugly, well, if you can do something as good as that then I'll listen to it, but otherwise no. So they said well, give us a few days and see if we can come up with something. So they revamped ""Please Please Me,"" which they'd had before, but it wasn't quite in that style. And they said they thought they had something. And I said, OK, we'll go into the studio and make it, and we did. And at the end of the take, I said, gentlemen, you've got your first No. 1.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""PLEASE PLEASE ME"")

THE BEATLES: (Singing) Last night I said these words to my girl. I know you never even tried, girl. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Please please me, whoa yeah, like I please you.

GROSS: Let's get back to the first tune that you recorded with them and that's ""Love Me Do."" The band right before that had had a different drummer than Ringo Starr. Who was the drummer and how did Ringo end up in the band?

MARTIN: Well, when I first met them and on the first tapes that I'd heard, the group was the three others and Pete Best - no Ringo. And Pete Best, in fact, was a very good-looking young man, a kind of sullen beauty about him. And he had a kind of James Dean-ish (ph) quality. But he wasn't too hot as a drummer - at least I didn't think so. And on the original tests, I said, you know, look, when we come to do our first single, I don't want to use Pete Best. I want to use a session drummer.

Well, unknown to me, the boys also felt the same way, and they were wanting to get rid of Pete anyway. So that my decision was a very convenient reason for them getting rid of him. So he got the boot. Poor Petey missed out on a fortune. And they looked around for another substitute, and they met up with Ringo who was playing in another Liverpool group. And when the next session came along, they bring in Ringo larger-than-life and say, well, our new member of our band. And I - aloof - said well, OK, I'll try him out. But I've got a session drummer I've already booked - Andy White. We'll use him if you don't mind. So we did a take with Andy.

And then I condescendingly allowed Ringo to have a go. And of course, Ringo was a very good drummer. And he quickly settled into the band. And in fact, his coming into the band was a kind of catalyst for the band. They kind of gelled then. They really got themselves together. And from that moment on, it was The Beatles against the world really.

GROSS: We're listening to my 1980 interview with George Martin, who died yesterday at age 90. Here's an excerpt of the interview in which we talked about producing The Beatles 1967 album ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" Martin told me that during the period those songs were written, John Lennon and Paul McCartney weren't - they weren't co-writing songs. They were each writing their own.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

MARTIN: By this time, they were writing quite different material. You could tell that - distinguish between their writings very easily. Contrary to most people's supposition, they very rarely wrote together. They did in the early days write ""From Me To You"" maybe together, but almost every song they wrote was a solo composition where the other one might help out with a word or two. And even though it's labeled John Lennon and Paul McCartney, looking back at it, you can easily tell which one's John and which one's Paul.

The Pepper idea only emerged after Paul had had this idea of writing a song called ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"" which was a kind of jolly little jingle. And it was his idea I think, which suddenly turned it around saying, look, how about if we make the song sung by the band themselves as though it was an actual performance by this fictitious band?

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND"")

THE BEATLES: (Singing) We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. We hope you enjoy the show. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, sit back and let evening go. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It's wonderful to be here. It's certainly a thrill. You're such a lovely audience. We'd like to take you home with us. We'd love to take you home.

MARTIN: Really, the songs don't link up very well. I mean, there's no real reason why we should have such diverse songs on it. It was a collection of songs still, but I tried to make it a coherent whole. And when we started - when we finished all our basic recordings, I then tried to link the whole lot together by means of sound effects and running one into another and so on. It was at that stage where the record almost grew of its own. It was like a crystal. It seemed to have a life of its own. And during most of the recordings, the boys were going through their sort of druggie phase anyway. They were fairly high quite a lot of the time. I'm sure they didn't really realize what was happening, but it just did seem to involve almost of its own generation.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS"")

THE BEATLES: (Singing) Picture yourself in a boat on a river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies. Somebody calls you. You'll answer quite slowly, a girl with kaleidoscope eyes.

MARTIN: In ""Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite!"" that song was built entirely around a poster that hung in John's house. You know how one decorates a house with odd things you pick up. Well, this was a genuine old circus poster, and on it were practically the lyrics of the song almost entirely as they are now. Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite, there will be a show at 10:15 on October the 27. The Henderson twins, Pablo Fanque's fair, Harry the horse - it was all down there. And he just wrote it into a song and came to me with it and wanted to do it, have an imagery of a circus. I always likened John and his songwriting - he had tremendous imagery. I regarded him not as being a drug person but more of a Salvador Dali of music. You know, he had a very free reining mind.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BEING FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR. KITE"")

THE BEATLES: (Singing) For the benefit of Mr. Kite, there will be a show tonight on trampoline. The Hendersons will all be there, late of Pablo Fanque's fair, what a scene. Over men and horses hoops and garters, lastly through a hogshead of real fire. In this way, Mr. K will challenge the world.

MARTIN: Obviously he wanted a calliope kind of sound. And I knew I needed steam organ sounds - you know, the kinds of things that used to be in fairs, fairground organs, which were driven by steam engines. And there were - and there still are - in existence many records of these. But they almost invariably play PD (ph) tunes, like ""Stars And Stripes Forever,"" and that kind of thing -marches. So I got a few of these records together. And I put them on tape. And I got the engineer. I picked out a few extracts. And I said to the engineer, OK, now, I want you to cut those tapes up into lengths of about a foot or 15 inches each. And having done that, he looked around - man, what do you want me to do with them?

I said, well, fling them up in the air. Of course, I was reputed to be eccentric anyway. SO he did just that. And now what do I do with them? I tell him, you pick them up again. And you put them back together again - but in whatever order it comes to. So he started tacking them all together. And he then quickly realized what I was on about. I wanted things to be in the wrong order. I wanted it to be jumbled - just a jigsaw of sound. And oddly enough, when he put it back together, a lot of the sounds were too much like the originals. So we had to turn things backwards - the odd bit here and there - and take it out and put it a few bars away. But we came up, eventually, with a hodgepodge of sound. It was just a kind of maelstrom of sound. It didn't - there was no particular tune at all. But it was calliope. It was steam organs, and it did give that sound. So I overdubbed that over the whole of the piece. You can hear it there, the kind of wish-wash background.

(SOUNDBITE OF THE BEATLES SONG, ""BEING FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR. KITE"")

GROSS: During that period and a little later on, a lot of people used to get high and play Beatles records backwards and listen for secret meanings.

MARTIN: Oh, yeah.

GROSS: Were there big secrets in those records?

MARTIN: There was - they were exactly what people - people found in them what they wanted to find. There was no messages. We'd put nothing in there. That was not intentional. At the end of ""Pepper,"" when we put it all together, we did two things which were in-jokes for us. One was to put a ridiculous amount of sound in the run-out groove and the other was to put an 18 kilocycle - kilohertz note on the end of it for dogs, we'd say, because poor dogs hadn't got anything to listen to. It was just an in-joke. We just did it for the heck of it. And the sounds that I put on in the inner groove, I just said to the chaps, the boys, all right, go down to the studio and do anything you like. Just sing anything or shout anything you like. And I just - they just do about five seconds of mumbo-jumbo, which really wasn't anything. And I lopped off two seconds of it and made a loop of it and put it on the run-out groove. Well, it so happened that people started playing it backwards and finding out all sorts of obscene messages, but it certainly wasn't intentional.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND"")

THE BEATLES: (Singing) I'd love to take you home.

For more than a century, mug shots have helped police catch criminals. Those photos of a person's face and profile trace their roots to Paris in the late 19th century.

Now, some of the earliest mug shots ever taken are on display at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The black-and-white photos were once on the cutting edge of how police identified suspects.

They were taken by a French criminologist named Alphonse Bertillon, and his techniques set the template that police use today.

Rise Of The Modern Mug Shot

Wilhelm Figueroa, director of the New York City Police Department's photo unit, says there are three parts of a mug shot the NYPD takes after arresting someone: the front view and both side views.

He estimates he has probably taken tens of thousands  and seen millions  of mug shots since he joined the department more than 30 years ago.

""No one looks like a criminal per se. There's nothing about a person's face that says, 'This person's a criminal,' "" he says. ""We're all capable of great good. We're all capable of being bad people.""

And profile mug shots are capable of helping police tell similar-looking people apart.

""Take 10 different people, take pictures of their ears and you'll be to identify each and every one of them because we all have different facets to our ears. Some of us have longer earlobes, some shorter, some thicker, some thinner,"" he says.

It's an observation that Bertillon championed back in the late 1800s. He went on to create a system for identification that the Paris Police Prefecture adopted in 1882, giving rise to the modern mug shot.

He wasn't the first to introduce mug shots to police, but he did standardize the way photos were taken and added the profile mug shot so police could zero in on a suspect's unique features.

""Men can grow facial hair to cover their chin, but you can't change the shape of your nose except through surgery. And you can't change the contours of your ear,"" explains Mia Fineman, one of the curators for the Met's new photo exhibition Crime Stories: Photography and Foul Play, which features some of Bertillon's work.

The mug shots were part of a broader system of measuring and comparing body parts to help police departments organize thousands of criminal records. In 1884, Bertillon's system helped Parisian police identify 241 repeat offenders. His work became so famous that in Arthur Conan Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles, a client offends Sherlock Holmes by calling him ""the second highest expert in Europe""  after Bertillon.

A Mug Shot Legacy

His reputation, though, faded as more police departments learned that fingerprinting was a simpler way to identify people.

Still, his style of mug shots became the standard. Jonathan Finn, a police photography expert who wrote Capturing the Criminal Image, says he is ""still very much with us"" today in other ways.

""Whenever you go through an airport or at a train station and anything else and somebody asks to see your identification document, that all has roots in the late 1800s and the work of people like Bertillon and his contemporaries,"" Finn says.

Figueroa says he thinks of Bertillon whenever he comes across an interesting mug shot.

""It could be an interesting curve of the ear, a unique tattoo. It could be a unique port-wine birthmark,"" he says.

Even in an age of DNA testing and iris scans, he says he doesn't think Bertillon's photo legacy is going anywhere.

""A victim still records the person had black hair, the person had a tattoo that said 'Mom' on their right shoulder. We still live in a very visual world,"" Figueroa says.

It's one that may have forgotten about Bertillon's name  but is still holding on to his mug shots.",[]

Give Rolling Stone some credit for transparency. Sean Penns account of his trip to meet Joaquin El Chapo Guzman is topped with this editors note:

Disclosure: Some names have had to be changed, locations not named, and an understanding was brokered with the subject that this piece would be submitted for the subjects approval before publication. The subject did not ask for any changes.

Theres a good discussion to be had about the line between activism and journalism and how far across it the El Chapo Speaks piece goes. Lets set that aside for now.

This post is about two simpler issues.

First, NPR does not create pseudonyms for sources. Doing so gives the audience a reason to ask what else might have been made up. If we need to protect someones identity, we most often use real first names, sometimes real middle names, sometimes real street or nicknames that the source is known by and sometimes descriptions (the husband, the sister, the officer, etc.). Whatever we do, we explain it in our reports. We include the reason why the person needs anonymity.

We also pay attention to the donts of anonymity. That is, no attacks, no disguises and no offers. The Ethics Handbooks guidance on anonymous sourcing is collected here. Of particular importance is this guideline: Describe Anonymous Sources As Clearly As You Can Without Identifying Them.

Second, NPR does not show its stories to sources before broadcast or posting. Here is our guidance:

For purposes of accuracy and fairness, there are times when we may want to review portions of a script with a source or read back a quotation to ensure we captured it correctly. We may also play audio or read transcripts of an interview to a third party if the purpose is to get that partys reaction to what another person has said. Otherwise, however, the public is the first audience for our work  we dont preview scripts or stories in advance of their broadcast or posting with sources, subjects of coverage or other parties outside NPR.

i toggle caption Craig Sugden/CBS Broadcasting, Inc Craig Sugden/CBS Broadcasting, Inc

When James Corden took over The Late Late Show one year ago, the question on everyone's mind was, ""James who?""

He was big in the U.K. In the U.S. he had starred in the movie Into the Woods and won a Tony for the play One Man, Two Guvnors on Broadway. But beyond that, he was relatively unknown.

So it's kind of unreal that after just one year in the chair, his show has broken records for people watching on YouTube.

That's mostly thanks to a segment called ""Carpool Karaoke."" Corden drives along with celebrities, just the two of them  in a car with a few mounted cameras  singing along to the stereo.

The Late Late Show with James Corden YouTube

The video he made with Adele has been viewed more than 80 million times. He has also done Carpool Karaoke with about a dozen other pop stars, including Justin Bieber and Elton John. The Wall Street Journal called it one of the most successful YouTube franchises of all time.

My producer and I met Corden at his office on the CBS lot in LA where he films The Late Late Show. ""All right, let's light a candle, shall we?"" said Corden. ""Three open-minded, broad-minded guys kicking back with a candle, right?"" The candle has a masculine scent, like leather-bound books. Corden's T-shirt exposes his new temporary tattoo: Cookie Monster, courtesy of his young son.

Corden told me the idea for Carpool Karaoke came out of a segment he filmed with George Michael for a charity back in the U.K., but he couldn't get anybody in the U.S. to sing along.

Finally, he tried Mariah Carey. ""It was a chance meeting with a lady at Mariah Carey's record company, who was here in our office, actually,"" he said. ""And I pulled her in here, to this very office that we're sitting in now, and I played her the clip of George Michael singing, and I was like, it's joyful. And that's what people want, you want to see the joy in people, and you want to see the person that always dreamt of being a star, you know? You want to see people having a great time. So Mariah Carey is a huge fan of George Michael, she said 'if George will do it, I'll do it, let's do it on Sunday!' ""

Interview Highlights

On the reaction to the first Carpool Karaoke

The second person we did it with was Jennifer Hudson, and that went through the roof. And then there's just been a couple of moments where  we did the one with Justin Bieber, which kind of went crazy, and I think is at 65 million views on YouTube right now. Both Justin and his manager were like, ""that's me. That's the real me in that car, that's me who you're seeing on TV.""

The Late Late Show with James Corden YouTube

On whether Carpool Karaoke serves as a kind of image rehab for some stars

Sometimes you can have a reputation for not being relatable and nice because you had a bad day once. That's the thing. And I think that's particularly pertinent with Justin, because you just forget how young he is. When he gets in a car with me and I feel that about him  and I don't ever want to make a show which is snarky or trying to do someone over, or trying to make it about me, somehow. All I want is our guests to shine, because if our guests shine, our show shines, and if our show shines, then I shine. I don't ever want to come out and make anything about me ... and the whole thing is a collaboration, those carpools.

On whether he dreamed, as a child, of being a pop or theater star

Of course! To be honest, all I wanted to do, all I ever, ever wanted to do, I just wanted to perform. I just wanted to perform in whatever capacity, whether it was acting, singing, dancing, comedy  whatever it was, I just loved it and felt at my absolute happiest when I was performing for people. And if that's what you want from a job, then this is the best job you could ever do.",[]

On Friday night, I finally got to see Hamilton, the critically acclaimed musical I've been surprisingly obsessed with since Frannie Kelley's glowing write-up of the cast album last fall.

I say ""surprising"" because I am not a fan of musical theater, the kind of not-a-fan-of-musical-theater who pointedly self-describes as such should musical theater come up in conversation. But there I was, gripping my seat, as Leslie Odom Jr., the virtuoso who plays Aaron Burr, stood onstage by his lonesome in ""Wait For It,"" my favorite song in a show lousy with fantastic songs.

That number, all about frustrations and ambition and jealousy and doubt, knocked me on my ass the first time I heard it on the album,  like, wtf, do I actually like musicals now?  and the live experience was equally overwhelming. I'd read somewhere that Odom and other cast members regularly focus their attentions on particular audience members while performing, and I'm 95 percent sure that Odom was looking dead at me in the sixth row, as I mouthed along all the words to his song. Just two Philly dudes separated by a few dozen feet and a gaping chasm of musical ability sharing this moment of real connection.

I told my colleague/friend Stephen Thompson, who was with me that night, about this during intermission, and he joked that it was probably because Odom and I seemed to be the only black guys in the theater that night. We laughed, but it was hard not to notice that while Hamilton has been hailed for deliberately casting actors of color as some of America's most venerated Dead White Men, and ""reclaiming the American story ... for the people whom history habitually forgets,"" the actors onstage seemed to make up the majority of brown people in the house the night I went.

This is of course an unscientific study, based on me craning my neck and looking around the room, but three other folks who've seen the show recently tell me the audience was overwhelmingly white when they went, too. Yesterday, I asked folks on Twitter who've seen the show to share their experience, and many of them told me the same thing.

I'm avoiding making a too-obvious ""Great White Way"" joke here, but it seems these observations track with Broadway audiences in general; according to The Broadway League, the trade association for the Broadway theater industry, nearly 8 in 10 people who saw Broadway shows in 2014-2015 were white and in their mid-40s. (That's more diverse and a decade younger than NPR's audience, for the record.) About 80 percent had college degrees and about 40 percent had graduate degrees.

Now, I'm not arguing that black and brown folks ""should"" go to Broadway shows, and there is, of course, lots of theater, far from Broadway, that caters to audiences of color. But it's worth asking why this ostensibly uber-POC-friendly phenomenon isn't consistently pulling a notably black and brown audience.

A bunch of folks in the Twitter conversation yesterday suggested that who goes to Broadway shows is a simple matter of dollars and cents. James McMaster at HowlRound recently made a similar assertion about Hamilton, which you pretty much can't see without parting with a couple of hundred bucks:

The exorbitantly high ticket prices coupled with the perpetually sold-out status of the production prohibit most working class people of color from attending the show. Given that the production's audience, then, is overwhelmingly white and upper-middle-class, one wonders about the reception of the show's racial performance. How many one-percenters walk away from Hamilton thinking that they are on the right side of history simply because they exchanged hundreds of dollars for the opportunity to sit through a racialized song and dance? My guess: too many.

This is a compelling argument, but then again, nearly half a million folks book flights and hotels and tickets for EssenceFest in New Orleans each year. Then there's the mad rush a few weeks back for tickets for Beyonce's surprise tour. That is to say, there's a whole lot of pricey entertainment that people of color are willing to drop serious dough on, but Broadway shows like Hamilton don't seem to rate. Money matters, of course, but it's not the whole story.

When it comes to race and Broadway audiences, a big part of the story seems to be acculturation. Theater has a long history of segregated seating and plays chock full of racist caricatures that meant black folks, in particular, never warmed to Broadway. ""Theatergoing on Broadway is supported by families who collected programs going back 50 or 80 years,"" James Hatch, the co-author of A History of African American Theatre, told WNYC in 2012. ""Blacks did not have that tradition, and apparently still don't.""

That plays out today in the important, subtle social cues about who belongs. It's hard enough getting comfortable in a social space when you're unfamiliar with its rules and conventions. It's even harder when you're aware of how much you stand out. At Broadway shows like Hamilton, you get the honor of having that experience for a few hundred dollars. Even as Hamilton exceeded my impossibly high expectations, I felt a vague unease sitting there that night, like I was at a hip-hop show where my favorite group was performing, but I might get shushed for rapping along too loudly. (But c'mon, y'all: HERCULES MULLIGAN!)

Not being a regular theatergoer or a Broadway vet meant I didn't know exactly how to be in the audience. I was unfamiliar enough with the ritual and customs of that space to be worried that I might be doing it wrong somehow. Could that disconnect be keeping folks who might shell out comparable cash for Bey, even if it means traveling to another city, from doing the same for Hamilton? Something I've been chewing on, and sound off on Twitter if you think I'm wildly off-base here.",[]

Nurith Aizenmans piece today on Morning Edition is highly recommended listening.

Travon Addison, an athletic 25-year-old with short cropped hair, a wispy beard and tattoos all over his arms, takes her through the Sandtown neighborhood of Baltimore. I wont spoil it by giving away what listeners learned from Addison. You should definitely keep listening to the end. Addison is a compelling character. Nurith and her editors tell his story well.

There are two other things worth noting:

 We use Addisons full name. That isnt a minor detail. It helps the piece enormously. In stories in which key characters are not fully identified, we have to explain why. That takes time and can lead listeners to wonder what else that person might be hiding.

Nurith didnt do what reporters at some news outlets do too often. She didnt start with the presumption that Addison would want to use just his first name or perhaps even remain anonymous (because he had been arrested earlier in the week). She assumed he would be fully IDd.

That is NPRs standard. As we have discussed before, we name names and do our due diligence. Whats more, whether to go with first-name-only needs to be discussed and explained.

Nurith says another person she met in Baltimore  a white woman who was marching with protesters  initially wanted only her first name to be used in any story. The woman said she didnt want to call attention to herself. Heres how Nurith convinced the woman to give her full name: by pointing out that doing otherwise could have just called more attention to her and raised questions about why she wanted to cloak her identity.

 We seize the moment. As she headed to Baltimore, Nurith ran through in her mind the sorts of stories she wanted to tell and the voices who could be part of those pieces. Those characters included people who live in Sandtown and could talk about what happened last week and in recent decades.

Nurith heard Addison complaining about how he and others werent being heard from and how outsiders dont know anything about his neighborhood and why there were riots. So she asked him to show me your Baltimore.

It was a simple request that produced an excellent story.

npr.org,2016-03-08 00:00:00,'A Man Lies Dreaming' By Lavie Tidhar,[],"Unnerving WWII Noir In 'A Man Lies Dreaming'

Books that imagine a different version of the World War II era are as old as Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle and as new as Philip Roth's 2005 novel The Plot Against America. But few of these alternate histories are as bold and unnerving as Lavie Tidhar's A Man Lies Dreaming. First published in the UK in 2014, the novel is now out in the U.S., and it couldn't appear at a more unnerving time: As if mirroring our current election cycle, it depicts a right-wing politician successfully stoking the fires of xenophobia and bigotry. But in the case of Dreaming, the setting is London in 1939  in a world where the Nazis never rose to power in Germany, and the British Fascist leader Oswald Mosley is leading the race to become the new Prime Minister.

Oswald, however, is not the main character in Dreaming. Tidhar's choice is far more audacious: The book centers around Wolf, a down-and-out private eye in London who escaped Germany in 1933 when the communists  not the National Socialists  took over. It becomes clear very early on that Wolf is, in fact, Adolf Hitler.

Tidhar has handled reviled, real-life figures in his fiction before, most notably in 2011's Osama, and at first Dreaming feels like a reprise. Tidhar has other plans, though. The plot of Dreaming unfolds like a hardboiled detective yarn, with Wolf being hired by a mysterious  and Jewish  femme fatale to find her missing sister. At the same time, he takes on a second case for Oswald, whom he both admires and resents for capitalizing on the same anti-Semitic, nationalistic ideas that Wolf himself once spread. Wolf, at heart, is still the Hitler of our world, with the same virulent beliefs and lust for power: ""Give me a large enough lever and I would move the very world,"" he snarls in frustration, a would-be despot who was never given the chance to twist the world into his own image.

If that kind of alt-history speculation comprised the entirety of Dreaming, it'd be an intriguing read. But it's only the tip of Tidhar's iceberg. In a story that intersects Wolf's, a Jew named Shomer  hailing from our version of reality  is a prisoner at Auschwitz. He's also a writer of pulp detective stories. The interplay between the two storylines grows profound as they progress. Wolf's investigations take bizarre, grotesque, blackly comedic turns while Shomer's horrific existence grows symbolic  and then something magically more than symbolic  when the SS assigns him the task of making doors.

'Dreaming' is a book of big ideas, from the pathological origins of racist ideology to the way humanizing and dehumanizing those we love or loathe are flip sides of the same coin.

Like any good alt-history, Dreaming is exhaustively researched. A multitude of historical figures pop up in its pages, including many literary ones  among them A. A. Milne, J. R. R. Tolkien, Ian Fleming, and Evelyn Waugh. Some feel gratuitous and even distracting; others, like G. K. Chesterton and his notions of law and anarchy from The Man Who Was Thursday, feed into the thematic fabric that Tidhar weaves. Dreaming is a book of big ideas, from the pathological origins of racist ideology to the way humanizing and dehumanizing those we love or loathe are flip sides of the same coin.

Functionally, Hitler is the hero of Dreaming. Tidhar evokes a flesh-crawling sympathy for the most hated man in modern history while degrading him physically, emotionally, and sexually. He also paints a bloodcurdling picture of Auschwitz, where ""men die like smoke"" and ""women die like air."" Holocaust survivor Yehiel De-Nur  author of the infamously lurid House of Dolls  appears briefly as a character in the book, observing that ""this is an alien planet [...]. This is Planet Auschwitz."" A few pages earlier, Wolf is absurdly, hilariously envisioning how he might have brutally subjugated Oz if he'd been its dictator, all while grudgingly admitting to himself how much he loves ""Over the Rainbow.""

Tidhar tightropes between fantasy, farce, and historical fiction, all while grounding things in brisk, gritty noir. Parallels to our current state of affairs abound, but if anything, they're simply symptoms of how the past can recycle itself in frightening new ways  a process that Dreaming compellingly picks apart and rewires. History isn't written by the winners or the losers, Tidhar illustrates, but by those who know how to shroud it and spin it the most entertainingly. Which only makes Dreaming all the more chilling.

We're so stoked to be heading back to Austin, Texas this month where NPR Music will host the South by Southwest opening night showcase, featuring live performances by some our favorite artists. It's one of the most sonically diverse lineups we've ever had on stage at Stubb's Barbecue, from the crushing rock of Mitski and Alt.Latino favorite Chicano Batman, to the rising country singer Margo Price, funk and soul master Charles Bradley, R&B singer Anderson .Paak and rapper Vince Staples.

If you're in Austin we hope you'll join us for the showcase. It starts at 7:30 p.m. CT on Wednesday, March 16 at Stubb's. But we'll also record every performance and post them here on NPR Music soon after.

Here's a bit more about each artist:

Charles Bradley came up in the 1960s and '70s during the glory days of soul and funk, but, remarkably, never had a record deal or released an album until 2011, when he was in his early 60s. That's when Daptone records discovered him at a James Brown tribute show and signed him up for his debut full-length, No Time For Dreaming. He followed it with 2013's Victim Of Love. His third full-length, Changes, is due out April 1. Here's Charles Bradley performing live at the 2012 Newport Folk Festival.

Chicano Batman hails from southern Los Angeles, with a sound Alt.Latino host Felix Contreras describes as ""'70s Chicano funk."" The group plays retro instruments from that era but blends cassic Brazilian bossa nova and samba with soul and psychedelic rock.

Mitski will bring the noise to our showcase this year. The singer and guitarist, whose great new song ""Your Best American Girl"" we featured on this week's All Songs Considered, is an intense performer who shreds the guitar. This summer she'll release her fourth full-length, the potent and memorable Puberty 2.

Margo Price is one of the most exciting new voices in country music this year. Based out of Nashville, she was rejected by the major labels but found a home as the first-ever country artist signed to Jack White's Third Man Records label. Her debut full-length, Midwest Farmer's Daughter is due out March 25. We recently featured her single ""About To Find Out"" on Songs We Love.

YouTube

Anderson .Paak (the dot stands for ""detail"") has been working for more than a decade on a meticulously crafted sound that rolls hip-hop together with electronic music and '70s soul. But his voice didn't reach a major audience until he appeared on a half-dozen tracks from Dr. Dre's 2015 album Compton. As far as some fans are considered, .Paak stole the show. His sophomore full-length, Malibu, was released Jan. 15.

YouTube

Vince Staples will close out our showcase. We first heard the rapper from Long Beach, Calif. guesting on songs by Earl Sweatshirt. Staples' 2014 song, ""Hands Up,"" from the EP Hell Can Wait, was a searing, chilling indictment against police violence and corruption. He followed it with Summertime '06, last year's full-length debut on Def Jam and one of our favorite records of 2015.

NPR's Kelly McEvers talks to petroleum-geologist-turned-writer Rick Bass about the art of the short story, specifically his short stories. A collection of the short stories he's written over the years is called, For A Little While.

KELLY MCEVERS, HOST:

The life of author Rick Bass is quite a story. He grew up in Houston and became a petroleum geologist. He would write on his lunch breaks. And then, in 1987, he moved to rural Montana and became an environmental activist. Since then, he's written dozens of books - nonfiction, novels, short stories - and won many awards. His new short story collection is called ""For A Little While."" It's a mix of old and new stories. Rick Bass says a short story is the best way to deal with the fast pace of life right now.

RICK BASS: The short story is a beautiful reservoir that you enter. You learn something, and you get out. It fits our brain. It's a unique package, a lozenge, a lens that helps us process all kinds of information. The classic short story form with that elegant, tapered shape - it's not formulaic. It's organic, and it fits who we are as a species.

MCEVERS: Like Rick Bass, many of his characters are off the grid and surrounded by nature. And many of them are incredibly lonely, and so I asked him if loneliness is the price of living so close to the wild.

BASS: I don't think it's the woods that make them lonely. You know, it's just the atoms bouncing around faster and faster. We're being called upon to respond, respond, respond - less downtime, less leisure time, less thinking time, less - no processing time. And when you're tired, you don't have energy for passion. When you're tired or overwhelmed, you don't have the resources to dream a big life, live a big life, and that can present itself in the form of loneliness - like, gee, I wish I had a community where I could just have a meal and sit down and talk for a while. Or I wish I had time to hang out more with my kids, or I wish; I wish; I wish. I think, again, it comes back to a question of time, really. I think time is the - kind of the factor here, and the loneliness - again, not landscape or externalities.

MCEVERS: It's interesting you talk about that because, you know, your stories are very languid, you know? They move at their own pace. Do you feel that they've gotten more so as you've sort of sensed this yearning and need for more time and space?

BASS: I would suspect so. That wouldn't surprise me. What I'm hungering for as a reader is the visuals, the reminders that the world is a beautiful place, and I'm just trying to bring, you know, almost a painterly illumination on sentences, on objects, on subjects. And so there is going to be more attention to the brushwork. And I think we're so hungry to have our five senses engaged-slash-re-engaged, that that's the best way to do it - is with sentences. And the stories will take care of themselves from those sentences.

MCEVERS: There's this one story. It's called ""Pagans.""

BASS: Sure.

MCEVERS: First, can you just describe what's happening in that story and tell us where it's set?

BASS: It's set in Texas on the Gulf Coast in the 1970s, a time of great cultural and sociologic change. The two boys and the girl - they're just navigating adolescence. They're navigating the interesting interface between friendship and romantic love, skipping school and going off and mucking around on the bayou in this really rich, fertile, lush environment that's got a lot of toxins in it from ship channel plumes and so forth. And...

MCEVERS: Yeah. I mean, they're basically playing with these pieces of machinery that have been sunk in the river. The river, you say, is poisoned. They've built kind of an altar out of kind of a pile of garbage, you know? And yet, to them, it is beautiful. I'm wondering if you could read a passage. You have the book, right?

BASS: I do, yeah. I'd be happy to.

MCEVERS: To set this up, the character's looking back. It's at the very end of the story.

BASS: (Reading) He wonders sometimes if there are not the ghost or husks of their other lives living still far back in the past or far below or even further out into the future still together and still consorting other lives birth from that strange reservoir of joy and sweetness and utter newness. And if there are, how does he access that - through memory, through imagination? Even now, he marvels at how wise they were then and at all the paths they did not take.

MCEVERS: The passage is so interesting. You know, it almost sounds like you're talking directly to the reader and this idea that there's another version of this story, and it's being lived out now.

BASS: Yeah, yeah.

MCEVERS: That, to me, seems like what must be the joy of writing - is that you get to think up those versions.

BASS: You're totally on it. And I would not have thought of it myself consciously, but it comes back to this idea of scale and time. You know, as a geologist, one of the mystifying and challenging things about mapping is, you know, unconformities, these vast stretches of settlement deposition that have been re-eroded, washed away. So you'll have an old formation, then the middle formation will be gone. then you'll have a younger formation on top of it. And there'll just be this missing chunk of, you know, 200 million years or something that - and you might find a few fossils down in another formation. And you might have a fault in truth that lifts up older rock up above younger rock. But there's a lot of stuff that happens that we never know about, yeah, you know, under the ground.

MCEVERS: And the fun is filling in the blanks.

BASS: It really is, yeah, and trying to connect dots from just a very few clues.

MCEVERS: Well, Rick Bass, thank you so much for your time today.

BASS: Thank you, Kelly. I appreciate it.

MCEVERS: That's Rick Bass. He's the author of ""For A Little While,"" a new collection of stories new and old. It's out now.

Recorded just before the duo's move to L.A., Dream All Over is a dusty piece of good-time rock 'n' roll that just wants to hit the open road. That's what appears to be the abstract narrative behind the video for ""Legends Of My Own.""

While Dylan Sharp normally shares vocal and guitar duties with Carrie Keith, Keith takes the vocal lead here on a melody that recalls Kim Wilde's ""Kids In America."" As a figure in a black hat gets busted on a deal, she sings, ""I looked familiar in a foreign land / I couldn't speak, but I could understand / From another life I rode / Into a desert of my own,"" like a drifter out to make the best of a bad situation.

Carrie Keith shot the L.A. scene on a ""Super 8 under the influence of the black sun,"" but from there, the story gets a little muddy:

Dececco came down with some silent concepts, and I had managed to acquire expired 16, so we shot with Mike Stoltz, and Nastassia plays the French shadow. I know Agnes Varda had been around, and she's often on my mind anyway. Late fall I was in Washington and went for a ride out to the coast with David Harris and Alex in her Cadillac, where we shot the color Super 8; some details I took from Melville, like the hat and overcoat against a cold background. The Camaro came back from Wyoming  my brother had souped it up  and my dad was running it around town, so we shot the two cars on a bridge over where the deal goes down.

CALLIE: Yeah.

SAGAL: OK, here is your first limerick.

CALLIE: Dad?

SAGAL: Dad, yes.

KURTIS: Yes, Callie, very, very good.

SAGAL: Very good, Callie. Lego want its toys - you know Lego, the toys - wants their toys to better reflect modern life. They've created a new figure called the stay-at-home dad. He comes with a baby, a stroller, an assorted tiny, tiny, tiny little miniature Lego bricks for him to step on and scream.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: It's a very accurate set. The mother who comes with it has a bottle to hand to the father to feed the baby. And she goes off to work in her professional-looking outfit.

FAITH SALIE: Is there a Lego breast pump?

SAGAL: There is probably.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: So she's working, he's at home. I guess we know whose pants snap into the torso in that family.

SAGAL: All right, Callie, that was very good. He was your next limerick.

KURTIS: With my face to the screen, I'm a numb clone. All my texting and swiping makes thumbs groan. Which providers sell plans for a string and two cans? I will downgrade and get me a dumb...

CALLIE: Phone?

SAGAL: Yes, phone.

KURTIS: Phone...

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

KURTIS: ...How about that?

SAGAL: People exhausted by the constant flow of information coming out of our smartphones are now going back to more basic phones. It's the 21st-century equivalent of quitting your job and joining a commune, except you can still bathe regularly. For example, one company called Light Phone - it makes a simple handset, doesn't do anything but make and receive calls. You pay for that. For an extra hundred bucks, you can get a cord that goes right into the wall.

(LAUGHTER)

SALIE: Do you remember when you had to use to uncurl the phone cords?

SAGAL: Oh, yeah, that was a big deal.

SALIE: Yes, I spent a lot of time doing that.

PAULA POUNDSTONE: What are you guys talking about? I still have phone cords.

(LAUGHTER)

POUNDSTONE: Yeah.

SAGAL: Is your phone one of those you have to pick up one part, hold to your mouth and the other part you hold to your ear like that?

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: Calling Western Union, I need to send a telegram.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: All right...

ROY BLOUNT, JR.: All right.

SAGAL: Here, Callie, is your last limerick.

KURTIS: For millennials, time is ethereal, so our food choices are cafeterial (ph). See, the effort it takes pouring milk on some flakes is just too much work making...

CALLIE: Cereal.

SAGAL: Cereal.

(SOUNDBITE OF BELL)

KURTIS: Cereal, Callie, 3 and 0.

SAGAL: We give millennials such a hard time. But as it turns out, they really are monsters. According to a survey of young adults that came out this week, millennials - people in their 20s - do not want cereal for breakfast because it is too much work.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: You've got the bowl; you have to put in the cereal. You have to add milk. Oh, my God. You're too exhausted to eat at that point.

(LAUGHTER)

SAGAL: General Mills has responded. They're very in touch with their consumer base. They've unveiled new Millennios cereal. It's just Cheerios, but it comes with a large mama bird who chews it up and regurgitates it directly into their mouth.

(LAUGHTER, APPLAUSE)

SAGAL: Bill, how did Callie do on our quiz?

KURTIS: She did perfect without any practice at all, 3 and 0.

SAGAL: Well done, Callie, thank you so much.

CALLIE: Thank you.

SAGAL: Thanks for playing.

npr.org,,Gyrocopter Story Raises An Old Question: When Should Journalists Intervene?,[],"Gyrocopter Story Raises An Old Question: When Should Journalists Intervene?

The Tampa Bay Times knew well in advance that a Florida postal worker planned to fly a gyrocopter over Washington, D.C., and on to the grounds of the Capitol.

From what the Times has reported, there seems to have been no evidence that the man, identified as 61-year-old Doug Hughes, intended to do himself or anyone else any harm. Theres also a case to be made that the Times had reason to believe authorities were keeping tabs on Hughes. The Times knew he had been interviewed some months back by a Secret Service agent. That means Hughes was  in theory  on authorities virtual radar. (He wasnt, it turns out, on any actual radar this week).

It isnt the Times job, or the job of any news outlet, to be the police.

But, the many ways things could have gone badly on Wednesday arent difficult to imagine. Well set aside the Hollywood scenarios of fighter jets and missiles.

Still:

 Hughes might have fooled the Times and had nefarious intentions.

 He could have been shot.

 If shots were fired, bystanders could have been hit.

 People could have been injured during evacuations or as police responded to the scene.

At the very least, as happened, streets would be closed and traffic tied up for blocks around.

The Times reporter on the story tells The Washington Post that the news outlet spent hours and hours talking about the ethics of this, and decided there was no need to tell authorities well before Hughes planned launch. The Times ended up calling the Secret Service while Hughes was in the air, less than a half hour before he landed.

Media ethicists, as the Post notes, disagree:  A news organization should be extremely knowledgeable of the potential harm a stunt like this could cause, said Edward Wasserman, dean of the University of California at Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. I really question their judgment. 

News outlets dont want sources to think reporters will run to the police about just anything potentially illegal that theyre told about.

But how about this? Apply common sense and weigh the value of the story against the potential harm to the public. That will continue to be our standard.

This is already happening, but its important not to forget that as we line up experts for two-ways and interviews about public policy issues, we need to know if theyre connected to or publicly support one of the presidential campaigns. A standard question these days should be something like are you advising any of the campaigns? Or, have you been called by any of the campaigns or candidates? Or, are you publicly supporting one of the candidates?

Check with them about connections to public policy groups and advocacy organizations as well.

We look for expertise on a wide variety of subjects that are campaign issues. They include climate change, criminal justice, economics, foreign affairs, immigration, national security and tax policy. The list could go on.

A yes response to one of our questions doesnt automatically disqualify someone, but it is information we need to know, weigh and tell our listeners and readers if its decided that person should be part of our report.

Meanwhile, our responsibility doesnt end with a no response from the expert. Trust, but verify. Do some searches to be sure that person hasnt shown up in stories about economists who support Smith or historians who are advising Jones. The expert may have an explanation. After all, campaigns sometimes exaggerate their support and academics sometimes sign on to things without quite realizing what theyve done.

Its also important to know whether someone has advised candidates or groups in the past. That information may help put the experts thinking in context.

How far down the ballot do we need to go? Its wise to ask whether theyre connected to any House, Senate or statewide races. We would also want to know if an expert in a particular field has gotten involved in a specific story  the Flint water crisis, for example.

Whos at the organic smoothie shop? Pat or Korva? Whos the she? When will she get back with that smoothie?

We offer this presumably fictional and rather convoluted sentence because many of us arent careful about making sure that the pronouns we use are clearly connected to the antecedents they replace. Editors see antecedent/pronoun problems in copy every day.

Lets pick apart the opening scene. This is what was happening:

 Korva wanted the car started at 3:07 a.m., not 3:05.

 Pat was at the organic smoothie shop getting Korvas Mango/Kale/Chia Supreme.

 Korva would have to wait until Pat returned to tell her about the new starting time.

Strunk and Whites The Elements of Style offers this advice: The relative pronoun should come, in most instances, immediately after its antecedent. Note, for instance, how much clearer it reads to say Korva would have to wait until Pat returned to tell her. Just four small words separate the antecedent from the pronoun. Its clear that Pat is her.

Please also take care to pair singular pronouns with singular antecedents and plurals with plurals. Gender agreement is important as well, but bear in mind that the choice of pronoun may be a sensitive issue when the subject is a transgender person.

As expected, Hillary Clinton won the Mississippi primary. Michigan was the bigger prize and polls leading into the primary had Clinton up by double digits, but that's not how it turned out.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

Voters delivered a surprise last night. Michigan gave a Democratic primary win to Bernie Sanders.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

He narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton despite polls that showed him far behind. That was just one result on a night when Clinton also won Mississippi, not to mention Republican wins for Donald Trump and also Ted Cruz.

INSKEEP: Let's focus on the Democratic results now with NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson, who's been covering all of this for many months. Mara, good morning.

MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Good morning.

INSKEEP: Can you put last night's Democratic results into one sentence?

LIASSON: Yes. Bernie Sanders once again exposes Hillary Clinton's potential weaknesses as a general election candidate.

GREENE: OK, there's the summary. We're going to talk much more about that, Mara. But - and we'll expand on that. Let's hear a little bit from the candidates and also from some of their advisers first. NPR's Tamara Keith has been covering the campaign.

TAMARA KEITH, BYLINE: If elections are about expectations and momentum, then Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders won the night last night. Hillary Clinton won the primary as expected in Mississippi by an overwhelming margin. But Michigan was the biggest prize. And polls leading into the primary had Clinton up by double digits. That's not how it turned out, not even close.

BERNIE SANDERS: I just want to take this opportunity to thank the people of Michigan, who kind of repudiated the polls that had us 20, 25 points down a few days ago.

KEITH: That was Bernie Sanders at almost 11 o'clock last night. He had given a speech hours earlier. But he was back to make a statement after it was clear voters in Michigan were making a statement of their own.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SANDERS: What tonight means is that the Bernie Sanders campaign, the people's - the revolution - the people's revolution that we are talking about, the political revolution that we are talking about is strong in every part of the country.

KEITH: In the final tally, Sanders won Michigan by 2 percentage points, a margin of about 20,000 votes out of a million cast. Exit polls indicate Sanders' message about international trade deals hurting American workers resonated with Michigan voters.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SANDERS: And frankly, we believe that our strongest areas are yet to happen.

KEITH: Sanders' campaign sent out a fundraising email celebrating the win and asking his supporters to pitch in just a little bit more. If history is a guide, this win will help Sanders raise millions of dollars in a matter of hours. And that money will help him compete and run TV ads in the next states on the election calendar - Florida, Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri and Ohio.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you so much. Hello, Cleveland. Hello, Ohio.

KEITH: Long before the results were in, Hillary Clinton, her campaign sensing Michigan wasn't going their way, spoke to supporters in Cleveland.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CLINTON: This will be a busy week here in Ohio.

(APPLAUSE)

CLINTON: And this campaign is about building a future where every American can live up to his or her full potential.

KEITH: For the Clinton campaign, losing to Sanders in Michigan is a speed bump, one they certainly would rather have avoided. But as Clinton's team sees it, this race isn't about momentum or expectations or even about wins. It's about delegates. And in that respect, Clinton didn't actually lose last night. She pulled further ahead. With her 66-point win in Mississippi and her close second in Michigan, she ended the night winning more pledged delegates than Sanders. As she spoke last night, it was clear that Clinton has one eye on Sanders but the other on Donald Trump.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

CLINTON: Now, running for president shouldn't be about delivering insults. It should be about delivering results for the American people.

KEITH: The delegate math remains in Clinton's favor. But Sanders' campaign adviser, Tad Devine, says this is a marathon not a sprint. He described the campaign strategy over the weekend to Politico reporter Glenn Thrush in his podcast called ""Off Message.""

(SOUNDBITE OF PODCAST, ""OFF MESSAGE"")

TAD DEVINE: We're going to try to beat her in pledged delegates. We think we've got until the end of the process to do that. We think we have - it's going to be hard. It's going to be tough. We know we have to win to get it done. But we think we can.

KEITH: And after their stunning come-from-behind win in Michigan, it's a whole lot harder to tell them they can't.

INSKEEP: That's NPR's Tamara Keith on the Democratic results from the primaries last night.

GREENE: And we were listening to that with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, who's still on the line. And Mara, Tamara just suggested the Clinton campaign is hoping that Michigan is just a speed bump. But you said a few moments ago that you see that state and Bernie Sanders' win exposing some potential weaknesses for Hillary Clinton. What are the weaknesses?

LIASSON: Well, I think that what it says is if she loses to a Democratic populist in Michigan, why wouldn't she lose to a Republican populist in Michigan in November? I mean, that's the whole Donald Trump argument. I can scramble the map. I can win in places that he says no, quote, ""normal Republican"" can win in. I can carry Michigan in the fall. I can do the same in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, et cetera. And I think it does expose her weaknesses. Populism is a very, very strong sentiment in the electorate in both parties.

INSKEEP: Now, in order to get to that general election for either candidate of course, they've got to win their party's nomination. And we just heard something interesting from a Sanders adviser that I want to translate. He said we're going to try to beat Hillary in pledged delegates. He's saying he wants to disregard these superdelegates, who have nearly all gone for Hillary Clinton and given her a huge advantage in the total number of delegates. Is it even mathematically possible, at this point, for Sanders' side to get a majority just of the pledged delegates and make some kind of a case at the convention that he ought to be the nominee?

LIASSON: Well, he has to win a very, very big percentage of the pledged delegates, over 50 percent, going forward if he's going to do that. And if he starts beating her in pledged delegates by large amounts, superdelegates will switch. We saw this happen in 2008, when Hillary Clinton was also ahead in superdelegates. But when Barack Obama started winning primaries, the superdelegates moved over.

GREENE: Mara, if you can, let's turn to one issue. I want to play you a bit of tape from a Democratic pollster, Margie Omero, who spoke to us a little bit earlier on the program this morning.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)

MARGIE OMERO: I was surprised to see trade be so salient, frankly. It's something that's pretty complicated and dense and different for every voter and how they experience it. But it may be important, particularly in the Midwest. And the results from last night may portend what we are going to see next week in some of the other contests.

GREENE: Bernie Sanders' message - sort of talking about the downside of free trade seemed to really resonate with Democrats in the state of Michigan. Is that something that Sanders can try and capitalize on in other states in the Midwest and elsewhere?

LIASSON: Well, absolutely. I think this sets him up very nicely for Ohio. What he's saying is, now I proved that I can win in a diverse state. Michigan is a state where the Democratic primary electorate is more like the national electorate. In other words, it has a lot of white voters but not a hugely disproportionate number of African-American voters. He can say that the Michigan electorate is more representative than the Democratic electorate in, say, Mississippi or South Carolina or any of the Southern states where she wins by huge amounts. So I think this really sets him up well for Ohio. And I think it would give the Clinton campaign some pause.

INSKEEP: Now, let's bring in another factor here and also talk a little bit about the Republicans because you mentioned Donald Trump appealing to a certain kind of voter, Sanders perhaps appealing to the same kind of voter. Does Hillary Clinton have the same power was the question you raised. We're told that Sanders won white working-class voters in Michigan. We're told that Trump appeals to white working-class voters. The question is, who are those people really? Let's listen from earlier today to Republican consultant John Feehery as well as Democrat Margi Omero again.

JOHN FEEHERY: Interesting that both Bernie and Trump are going for those same voters. And I think that they're doing better than expected in both parties.

OMERO: You know, I cringe when I hear comparisons between Trump and Sanders. I mean, Trump is using just hateful language. I think it's something that Republicans should worry about. I think we should all be worrying about him becoming a nominee and what that means for our political process. Meanwhile, I don't think the same is true. Obviously, the same is not true for Sanders.

INSKEEP: What do the numbers suggest about whether Trump and Sanders really are appealing to the same kinds of people?

LIASSON: Well, I think there is some overlap. And I think this is what Donald Trump is saying he can do in the fall. He can say he can bring in white working-class voters who either have never voted before, have voted for Democrats or they're independents. And that's why he's saying that he can win in November using these same issues. Now, he is certainly not - doesn't have the same message as Bernie Sanders, is much more nativist, much more xenophobic. But he is trying to temper it. Every so often, Donald Trump tries to sound more unifying, note, less belligerent and, you know, with varying degrees of success. But that's clearly his general election strategy.

GREENE: Mara, heading into this night, I mean, we had - the stop Trump campaign in full force, led by Mitt Romney and others, seemed on its face to backfire. But if you are a Republican and you do not want Donald Trump to be the nominee, is there anything you can look to last night that would give you some sort of hope?

LIASSON: Not much. I think there were some glimmers of hope over the weekend. But the only thing I think a Never Trump person could look to is that now even more money - many, many millions of dollars - are going to be spent against him next week in Ohio and Illinois and Florida. And maybe that will be kind of the last experiment of the Never Trump movement, to see if this negative advertising actually does slow him down. But I think if you're a Never Trump person, you have to be looking pretty hard at Ted Cruz.

INSKEEP: Just one - just about 10 seconds here. And this is just one poll, but there was an NBC poll finding that all of Trump's challengers would beat him if it were a head-to-head race. Is there still a large ambivalence among the Republican electorate, not the leaders - in about 10 seconds - about Trump?

LIASSON: Well, sure because for every new white working-class voter he brings in, he turns off a suburban college-educated woman and energizes 15 Hispanics.

INSKEEP: OK.

LIASSON: And that's why there's doubts.

INSKEEP: Mara, thanks as always.

LIASSON: Thank you.

INSKEEP: That's NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson, talking through the Democratic results primarily last night.

NPR's Ari Shapiro talks with Somini Sengupta, the former New Delhi bureau chief for The New York Times, about her book, The End of Karma: Hope and Fury Among India's Young.

ARI SHAPIRO, HOST:

Somini Sengupta left India as a young child in 1975. Thirty years later, she returned as the New Delhi bureau chief for The New York Times. The 21st century country she found as a journalist was nothing like the one her parents grew up in. Today, India is youngest country in the world with 365 million people between the ages of 10 and 24. A million turn 18 every month.

SOMINI SENGUPTA: They join the labor force. They register to vote. They embrace the Internet, many of them for the first time. They fall in love. And all those things change their own country profoundly.

SHAPIRO: It's a country with a democratic government, a country with constitutional guarantees. And that means it's a country with enormous expectations and challenges.

SENGUPTA: One is how to level the playing field so that there's at least some equality of opportunity for both men and women and, I would argue, particularly women who have really not enjoyed the equality that the Constitution of India had promised them 70 years ago. And the other related challenge is how much to let this generation speak their mind. India has always had a very ambivalent relationship with free expression, and that is all the more pronounced now during the Internet age.

SHAPIRO: Somini Sengupta follows seven young people and their aspirations in her latest book, ""The End Of Karma: Hope And Fury Among India's Young.""

SENGUPTA: I call this ""The End Of Karma"" because the people I write about - they're all trying to overcome their past. They were born with one destiny. They are trying to make another. And they're all stories of incredible grit and resilience and great hope but also a bit of fury - quite a bit of fury, which is why the subtitle of the book is ""Hope And Fury Among India's Young.""

SHAPIRO: And this idea of trying to overcome your past - how new is that for India - that your past is not necessarily destined to be your future.

SENGUPTA: I'll tell you the story of one child who I met in reporting this book. Her name what's in reporting this book. Her name is Varsha (ph). She was the daughter of what's known as a presswala (ph). Her family had a business pressing clothes at the end of a block under a tree. And ever since Varsha was a small girl, she would go around collecting the rumpled bundles of clothes, and she would help her parents pressing them - saris and salwar kameezes and button-down shirts. And the one thing she didn't want to be was a presswala or a presswala's wife. And she really, really wanted to be a cop, a policewoman.

And her father, who was her great champion, was also very much against this idea. He wanted to marry her off to a good family, and he couldn't bear the idea of her being a policewoman. So the story of Varsha is really the story of a girl who tries to overcome her past, who tries to grow wings and a story of a father who has to decide how far he will let her go.

SHAPIRO: Do you expect that five years from now she'll be a police officer or a presswala or something else?

SENGUPTA: I think it depends largely on how hard Varsha is willing to push. She has already pushed her father to go quite a mile. Her father did not want her to even finish high school or go to college. He was very nervous about what would happen to her, and she's managed to push him ever so steadily just by dint of determination and resilience. But she has also had to tamp down her dreams every step of the way.

SHAPIRO: So many of the stories in this book reminded me of stories we hear about early 20th century America. And almost the minute that thought entered my head, (laughter) I reached the sentence you wrote, this country is not a country of Horatio Algers, referring, of course, to the quintessential story of transcending destiny in early 20th century America. So while many of the stories do follow this model that the U.S. seems to have followed a hundred years ago, you're saying, no, there's a big difference here.

SENGUPTA: Well, I think the myth of Horatio Alger has increasingly been shown to be a myth even in our own country. But I think you're absolutely right that the parallels between India and the United States are just remarkable. India was a very unlikely country at its birth in 1947. It was made up of a bunch of different ethnicities, a lot of different languages. And frankly, there were a lot of naysayers who said there's no way that a country that is so poor, that is so diverse is ever going to hold together.

It did hold together, and it has made some remarkable gains since independence. My parents, who were born during the independence era - they're called midnight's children. In their time, life expectancy was 32, and today, it's 66. In their time, infant mortality rates were sky high, and now it's diminished remarkably. In my father's time, when he went to school, there were fewer than half of all Indian children who were enrolled in school. They certainly didn't include dalits or outcasts. They certainly didn't include many girls. And today, nearly all Indian children are in school.

SHAPIRO: Your parents, who, as you say, came of age in the era of Indian independence, were known as midnight's children, a phrase made famous by Salman Rushdie in his novel. You call this young generation noonday's children. Explain what that means.

SENGUPTA: This generation of Indians, because their expectations are so high, they are so demanding and so restive in many ways that I think of India at this moment as a country at high noon. And I'll tell you one story. I remember going out to a school in rural India in a state called Bihar. And it was wintertime, and it was early in the morning. It was a bright, sunny, crisp morning. The mist was rising from the fields. And all these children were just streaming into school, carrying these empty rice sacks because that's what they would sit on. There was not enough chairs or tables or benches for them, and so they would spread them out on the floor, on the grass outside of school, and they would try to get an education.

Now, I went there with a remarkable Indian NGO called Bhutan. They were trying to assess what children were actually learning in school. And as it turned out, half of all fifth-graders couldn't read a basic sentence. Half of all fifth-graders couldn't subtract. And these were children who had been in school for five years. And I'll never forget what one of the social workers who I accompanied - he said to me, you know, when these children grow up, they'll curse us. They'll say, we came to school, and we learned nothing.

SHAPIRO: And your commitment to these people whose stories you tell really comes across in the book where, again and again, I was struck by the number of times you would follow up with a 14-year-old as a 17-year-old (laughter) or an 18-year-old as a 21-year-old, not just tracking their stories but perhaps giving them career advice and helping provide perspective. You come across as very, very invested in these stories.

SENGUPTA: Well, thank you. I did get pretty close to all of these young people, some more than others. And I have to say, I had to resist giving the girl that I described earlier, Varsha - I had to resist giving her too much career advice because I did, at one point, consider giving her the form - the application form to fill out for the Indian Police Service. And then I stopped myself. I thought, well, you know, that's for her to do.

SHAPIRO: Somini Sengupta covers the United Nations for The New York Times, and her new book is called ""The End Of Karma: Hope And Fury Among India's Young"" - great talking to you. Thank you so much.

SENGUPTA: Thank you, Ari.

Please use the phrase temporary protective status, not temporary legal status, when referring to the provisions of DACA and DAPA.

Denice Rios advises that:

The term temporary legal status when it comes to DACA (Deferred Action for childhood Arrivals) ... keeps popping up and it isnt accurate. ... We all look for easy ways to describe complicated bureaucracy. But using the word legal even when preceded by temporary is problematic. DACA offers some benefits, like a work permit or a reprieve from deportation, but it doesnt offer all the benefits one would receive if one were here legally. Thats why temporary protective status or simply offering an example or two of what the actions offer are better ways to explain DACA and DAPA (Deferred Action for Parental Accountability).",[]

In Sunday's Democratic debate, the gloves came off between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. In tonight's Univision/Washington Post debate broadcast on CNN, don't expect them to go back on anytime soon.

i toggle caption Andreas Neumann/Courtesy of the artist Andreas Neumann/Courtesy of the artist

Given Iggy Pop's recent announcement that he may be retiring from the music business, it's been an introspective time for the rock giant. That might be part of why Pop's new album  a collaboration with Josh Homme  bears the title Post Pop Depression. Not that the album itself is quite as ominous as its name. Throughout its nine songs, Pop pipes in his most unctuous croon, a work of nature that's only become more monumental as it's eroded over the decades. But with Homme's acumen as the architect of Queens Of The Stone Age stirred into the mix, there's decadent ecstasy to the album that's as far from glum as you can get.

It is heavy, though. In addition to producing and co-writing Post Pop Depression, Homme provides guitar, bass, piano and backing vocals; also in the group are guitarist Dean Fertita (Homme's right-hand man in Queens Of The Stone Age, as well as Jack White's bandmate in The Dead Weather) and drummer Matt Helders of Arctic Monkeys. With that kind of lineup, it's clear that this isn't going to be any kind of retirement party, and Pop obliges his younger cohorts' zeal with plenty of his own. The album is all sharp angles and hard muscles, from the choppy, stomping riff of ""Break Into Your Heart"" to the splintered rage of ""Paraguay.""

""I have nothing but my name,"" Pop intones at the close of ""American Valhalla,"" his voice a study in smoke and gravel. For a man whose musical fortunes have seen many peaks and valleys  during some stretches of his long career, it has indeed felt as if Pop's name was all he had going for him  it's a chillingly vulnerable confession. But even when he lets out some morbid paranoia during ""In The Lobby"" (""My shadow is walking in front of me / And I hope I'm not losing my life tonight""), he seems more like a predator than prey.

Still, he never lets the album get too pensive. His spoken-word, expletive-laden, anti-laptop rant in ""Paraguay"" is the kind of get-off-my-lawn stuff that Pop has more than earned the right to unleash. But for every glimpse at the punk of old, Pop drops tender moments like ""Gardenia,"" a lush, catchy love song that's also ever-so-slightly eerie. The most sentimental moments, though, come when the band is clearly channeling Pop's high point as a solo artist: his collaborations with David Bowie in Berlin on the classic '70s albums The Idiot and Lust For Life. ""Sunday,"" for instance, unabashedly recalls that era with its skeletal yet punchy drumming, sculpted guitar and avant-garage edge.

In ""German Days,"" the record's most flagrantly nostalgic song, Homme and his team tap into the decadent, wiry menace of the Berlin albums while Pop glances back with rueful irony at Lust For Life: ""When your love of life is an empty beach / When it's painful to express the things you feel."" In lesser hands, that might come off as self-parody, but instead, the singer sounds like he's owning his legacy  and having a good time doing it, introspection notwithstanding. If Post Pop Depression does end up being Pop's last recorded hurrah, it's a worthy one.",[]

npr.org,2016-03-10 00:00:00,Wild Energy Flows Free In A Feminist Comics Anthology,[],"Wild Energy Flows Free In A Feminist Comics Anthology

Hot blue lightning seems to crackle, Star-Wars-Emperor-style, across the surface of The Complete Wimmen's Comix. Its title is a cheeky riff on the renaming passion that consumed feminism in the early '70s, and its two volumes come in a (actually rather ugly) salmon-colored box decorated with examples of the series' highly inconsistent artwork. The whole bulky thing feels like a suitcase bomb packed with jagged hunks of social revolution. And that energy keeps sparking throughout the 704 pages of this frenetic, anarchic, occasionally kamikaze production.

It's hard to think of an aspect of women's lives, real or fantastical, that Wimmen's Comix doesn't touch on. In 1971's ""Breaking Out,"" a cabal of female comics characters  including Little Lulu, Betty and Veronica, and Petunia Pig  rise up against sexist double standards. (Betty and Veronica picket outside the high school, demanding classes in karate and women's history.) In Joyce Farmer's 1975 ""Equal Rites,"" a dozen naked witches hold a birthing ritual to summon their forbears' spirits from outer space. Cecelia Capuana's ""Modemorphose,"" from 1985, shows women's bodies changing to reflect the strangeness of female fashion: The figures grow huge bottoms, uni-bosoms or multiple legs that stick out in all directions.

Many of the artists fantasize about crime. In 1976's ""Petite Morte,"" Joey Epstein envisions an all-woman street gang called the Tenderettes that rolls men for drug money  until one gang member develops a strange and lethal passion for their marks. In Melinda Gebbie's 1976 ""The Confectionary,"" a sex-starved woman holds up a couple, kills the woman and rapes the man. Sharon Rudahl tells of a woman helping her son escape from a Mexican jail in ""Jailbreak at Hermosillo.""

Some artists simply turn a wry eye on the mundanities of life. In 1988, Mary Fleener recalls her friendship with a self-dramatizing ""Trauma Mama."" In Teresa Richards' 1976 ""Chapstick,"" a woman fantasizes a steamy, explicit tryst on an elevator, then settles down to watch ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.""

It's genuinely painful to imagine the radical, clashing perspectives that might have been found in these pages if the collective had only reached out to more women of color.

It may be hard to see how ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"" and female-on-male rape can find homes in the same publication. But there's a strong, common current of energy unifying Wimmen's Comix. That's partly because some feminist issues, like abortion, are as fraught today as they were back in 1971. It's also because the collective seems to have remained mostly white, as far as can be judged from the photos in the introduction and the skin tone that predominates in the comics. It's genuinely painful to imagine the radical, clashing perspectives that might have been found in these pages if the collective had only reached out to more women of color.

They did reach out to a huge number of contributors  apparently regardless of artistic talent. The artwork is a total grab bag, ranging from the polished creations of Rudahl, Trina Robbins, Phoebe Gloeckner and Dot Bucher to painfully amateurish doodles by creators better left unnamed. Mixed in is subversive work in which wild, even ugly scrawls evoke an unnerving sense of chaos (Dori Seda, Diane Noomin and the perennially obstreperous Aline Kominsky-Crumb). There's even the occasional contribution from a soon-to-be-notable name (Lynda Barry, Alison Bechdel, Julie Doucet).

There's one more reason for the unity of spirit in Wimmen's Comix: These these artists, all clearly in agreement that ""the personal is political,"" are much more comfortable with the first half of that pairing. They do tackle equal pay for equal work in the publication's early years and AIDS in later ones, with a dizzying assortment of topics in between. Rape, prostitution, sexual harassment, vegetarian cooking, science fiction, gothic romances, socks, bondage, nuns, farting, motorcycles and magic all feature in these pages. There are feminist fairy tales, stories of Harriet Tubman and Julia Pastrana, the Ugliest Woman in the World, a board game, and a pointillist study of a cervix. There's even a 3-D issue (glasses included).

Still, though, these comics largely stick to the personal, to relationships and fantasies and the absurdities of everyday life. Whether it's 1971 or 1989, the contributors' favorite topics are self-definition and men, men, men. (Not to mention sex, sex, sex. Everyone is doing it in these pages, including cats and bugs.)

The new HBO series Vinyl explores the seedy underpinnings of the music business in the 1960s and '70s. The show, whose executive producers include Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, has been resurrecting and recreating great songs from those days in each Sunday night episode. One of the exciting ""cover"" tunes done for next week's show is ""Watch Your Step,"" an R&B song made famous by Bobby Parker in the summer of '61. Here it's covered by The Arcs. When we asked Dan Auerbach why the band played this song, he answered in a way that mimics the show: ""What Marty wants, Marty gets.""

""Watch Your Step"" is a tune whose influence  in particular Parker's guitar line  would be heard again and again in music in the early '60s, particularly in George Harrison's guitar line to The Beatles ""I Feel Fine"" and Jimmy Page's performance on Led Zeppelin's ""Moby Dick."" The song was a moderate hit in the U.K.

There's an 18 track collection of songs from the series that came out when the show launched, but Vinyl also has a series of mini soundtracks it releases each Friday tied to Sunday's episode. Along with The Arcs, here's what's on this week's show, and available as EP Volume 1.5.:

1) Rosco Gordon  Let's Get High

i toggle caption Geoff Robbins/AFP/Getty Images Geoff Robbins/AFP/Getty Images

The remaining four Republican candidates debate once again tonight in Miami. Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich will be on the stage together for the last time before next Tuesday's big primary night when voters in Ohio and Florida  Rubio and Kasich's home states  go to the polls. Tuesday is a make or break night for the two of them and tonight's debate is the last chance they have to change the dynamic in a race that has not been going their way.

Here are four things to watch  one for each candidate.

1. How will Trump behave?

Lately the front runner has been trying to appear more ""presidential,"" holding press conferences instead of rallies after his primary wins to project more gravitas. In the last debate, he announced that he was flexible and would change his positions if necessary in order to break the gridlock in Washington. But that was just minutes before  and after  he talked about the size of his hands and a certain part of his anatomy. So we're not sure which Trump will show up tonight  the one who calls his opponents stupid, fat, losers, or the one who promised on Tuesday night: ""I can be more presidential than anybody other than the great Abe Lincoln. He was very presidential, right?""

2. Does Cruz punch up or down?

Cruz is in the number two spot  only about 100 delegates behind Donald Trump. He has the strongest case to make that if the nominee is not going to be Trump, it should be him. Some establishment Republicans in the #nevertrump movement are coming around to the idea that as much as they dislike Cruz he might be their only choice. Lindsay Graham, no fan of Cruz's, says it may be time to rally around the Texas senator. Still, Cruz has a total of ZERO endorsements from his fellow senators.

Tonight, does Cruz use his formidable debating skills to try again, to cut Trump down to size, or does he attack Rubio and Kasich, whose continued presence in the race prevent him from consolidating the anti-Trump vote?

3. Rubio on the ropes

Now that Jeb Bush has left the race, Rubio has become Trump's preferred punching bag. Rubio tried undermining Trump with insults but that didn't work. Trump needled him about this on Tuesday night, helpfully pointing out that, ""hostility works for some people . It doesn't work for everybody, O.K.? ""

Rubio has the most to lose next week. If he doesn't win his home state of Florida, he will not only give up any shred of viability as a candidate, he could also hurt his political career going forward. Unlike Cruz and Kasich, who have day jobs they can keep, Rubio gave up his Senate seat to run for president and is not running for reelection in the fall.

4. Kasich needs to win something

Kasich has an even worse record in this primary than Rubio, who won in Minnesota and Puerto Rico. Kasich hasn't won anywhere. Tuesday was a disappointment for Kasich. He came in third in Michigan, which is a rust belt state like his own Ohio. Kasich once had hopes of winning there or placing a strong second.

Trump is beating him in the polls in Ohio and Kasich has said that if he doesn't win his home state he's done. So, tonight, what does Kasich do to claw his way back into contention? Does he continue his ""Mr. Nice Guy"" strategy, showing voters that he's a reasonable, not very partisan, not very angry candidate who is as fed up with the antics of his opponents as they are? Or does he actually try to take on Trump?

Granted, that hasn't worked for anyone else but there's not much time left.",[]

i toggle caption Elise Tyler/Courtesy of the artist Elise Tyler/Courtesy of the artist

""I went looking for a new direction / Indecisive, undecided,"" Damien Jurado sings in ""Onalaska,"" one of the eeriest tracks on his new album, Visions Of Us On The Land. He's singing in character; there's nothing remotely indecisive or undecided about Visions. His direction, though, is indeed pretty new. The album is the final installment of a loose trilogy Jurado began with 2012's Maraqopa and continued on 2014's Brothers And Sisters Of The Eternal Son. This time around, he's delivered a sprawling, 17-song story arc that picks up where Brothers left off  that is to say, somewhere near the edge of terra incognita. After a car crash sends the trilogy's unnamed protagonist on some hazy kind of metaphysical odyssey, he's arrived at a state of existential bemusement, searching his psyche for answers. It's a heady concept, for sure, but one that Jurado anchors in gorgeous songwriting and lush, layered indie-folk arrangements.

That said, Visions isn't folky in a heart-on-the-sleeve kind of way. Jurado's no stranger to sad, sparse songs  he built his early career on them  but on Visions' ""Sam And Davy,"" for instance, he forgoes the acoustic confessional in favor of something far grander. Not to mention bleak: With minor chords, booming bass-drum detonations and menacing flourishes of synth, Jurado yanks the wheel and forces a detour into the depths of psychedelic reverie, asking, ""Does your blood run cold / Or your eyes go white / On a borrowed soul / And on borrowed time?"" In ""Prisms,"" Jurado channels one of his longtime heroes, Nick Drake; a more skeletal, guitar-plus-vocal track, it ponders the nature of memory as Jurado sings, ""Do we still go on / Long after rewind?"" His voice is so ghostly and echoing, it answers his own question.

Things don't exactly get upbeat from there  although ""Exit 353,"" the first song he wrote for the album, has more of a left hook to it. A propulsive, chillingly lonely dirge spiked with a distorted, tooth-rattling guitar riff, it contains yet another unsettling question (""Are we all not lost in song?"") whose response is self-evident. And in ""A.M. A.M.,"" Jurado's singsong, reverb-cushioned melody is as plush as it is haunting. Richard Swift, an accomplished singer-songwriter in his own right, once again provides the assist as both producer and guest instrumentalist; his shadowy atmospherics stand out in ""Mellow Blue Polka Dot,"" a cooing, catchy shuffle that recalls Bill Callahan's dark pop explorations.

Jurado has been playing the long game with his trilogy of albums, but the story arc doesn't come to a satisfying conclusion  nor should it. After the fingerpicked, Dylan-esque hush of ""Orphans In The Key Of E,"" Jurado wraps up the album with a glance over the shoulder: ""When I look back upon my time, see the snapshots of my life,"" he sings, ""You will not be surprised to see your name across my smile."" It's a small, welcome moment of sentimental peace, but it's fraught with its own ominous sense of loss as the refrain of ""I will remember you / The way you are right now"" begins to sound more like a fading distress signal than a comfort. As works of mood-altering music go, Jurado has upped the dosage with Visions. It's a harrowing trip, led by a guide who's all too familiar with the territory.",[]

On how ISIS challenges American Muslims to think more critically

ISIS preys on our inability to walk and chew gum at the same time. It's making us think more critically. It's making us look critically at the way our media tells stories about how this happens. It's making us think and look critically at American foreign policy. It's making us think and look critically at the way we construct Islam in America.

On how ISIS thrives on ignorance and lack of critical thinking

ISIS is not doing these things just nilly-willy. They're very methodic. So as a Muslim if you go and you try to refute them, you're likely going to fail, because they'll be quoting scripture, sayings of the Prophet, historical events from early Islam. And most Muslims don't have that. They're not equipped with the proper knowledge, and so ISIS thrives on our own ignorance and our lack of critical thinking.

On the growth in both extremism and atheism

On one extreme, you have the yahoos, right? And they're going to go and be attracted by that rhetoric. Then on the other side you have the regular Muslims, and they're just, maybe they're not feeling it anymore. I mean, I know, personally, I get emails all the time, people doubting their faith.

On how Muslims need to make religious literacy a top priority

North Carolina voters are likely to be confused when they arrive at the polling place on March 15th. In addition to presidential candidates, voters will see congressional primary candidates on the ballot.

But thanks to a federal court decision, the districts those candidates represent no longer exist and any voters in those races won't count.

Thanks to three judges, two animal shapes and one hastily redrawn map of U.S. House seats, North Carolina politics have been thrown into chaos.

It started to go off the rails on February 5th when a panel of three federal judges determined that the boundaries of the state's 1st and 12th congressional districts were drawn in such a way to concentrate African American voters and dilute their overall influence.

Coming just five weeks ahead of voting, there was no choice but to ""Stop the current election, go back, redraw the lines,"" said Josh Lawson, general counsel for the North Carolina State Board of Elections.

Redrawing The Animal Shapes

If you're not familiar with North Carolina's congressional map, here's where the animals shapes come into play.

The 1st District looks kind of like an octopus, whose body hugs the Virginia border and whose tentacles stretch east and west and halfway down the state.

The 12th congressional district is more snake-like  sometimes no wider than the span of an interstate - and extends more than 80 miles from Charlotte to Winston-Salem.

The federal court decision surprised many in the state, especially because the U.S. Department of Justice approved the maps five years ago.

Faced with the court order, the state's Republican legislature opted for a drastic redrawing of North Carolina's entire congressional map, finishing the job in just two weeks.

""Eleven out of the 13 districts saw major changes,"" said Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College. ""Some sitting members of Congress woke up the next morning after these maps had been released and went, 'oh boy, I don't even live in the district now.'""

In fact, the home of U.S. Rep. Alma Adams (D-NC) in the old, snaking 12th District is two hours away from the borders of the newly-redrawn, short and squat 12th District.

Most of the other districts were also stretched or shifted, which means that ""lots of folks now have different representation than they did before,"" said Lawson.

Primary Chaos

The process has created a host of logistical hurdles for elections officials in North Carolina, starting with a process known as geo-coding to determine who represents every voter in the state. Next, officials need to reprint more than 4,5000 different types of ballots. And then there's the question of who's ON the ballot.

""Under the current map 46 people are currently running for Congress, but that number would be expected to grow substantially,"" said Lawson, because the state has reopened the filing period to allow more candidates to run in the newly-drawn districts.

All of this takes time  so state lawmakers moved the primaries for U.S. House races from March 15th to June 7th.

However, the March 15th ballots have already been printed and they include congressional candidates. So election officials have urged North Carolina voters to fill the entire ballot out - even though votes for U.S. House candidates won't be counted.

It's an effort to tamp down confusion although telling voters to cast votes in a non-existent race is a situation that Lawson admits he did not foresee.

The federal judges who threw out the original congressional map still have to approve the one drawn by the state lawmakers. If the judges reject it, they can tell the legislature to redraw the map or the judges will redistrict the state themselves.",[]

YouTube

Carolina Chelele is a contestant on a popular reality TV show. But it's not about dating, housewives or survival. It's about ... farming. Specifically farming by females.



She and her competitors have each been given a bag of mortar and a single seed. The cameras are rolling. Thousands of dollars in prizes are on the line. The producers ask them: How do you plant it?

Ready? Set? Go!

Some farmers planted the seed directly in the mortar (in case you're not sure what mortar is, it's a mix of sand and cement). Others mixed the mortar with soil or mud. But Chelele, 49, sat back. She didn't touch the stuff.

""This challenge is impossible,"" she said.

She was correct, of course  you can't plant a seed in mortar. Water would just make it harden and set around the seed, which would have no room to grow.

Chelele's agricultural smarts (and common sense) helped her beat 14 other women farmers and win season 5 of Tanzanian's Female Food Heroes last August.

The show, sponsored by the international charity Oxfam, was created to show Africans just how valuable hard-working, experienced women farmers like Chelele are  even though they're not reaching their full potential.

Women make up 53 percent of Tanzania's small crop producers, but produce, on average, 14 percent fewer crops per acre than plots managed by men  which means they earn less money. This is because they lack access to credit, labor and fertilizer, factors essential to productivity, according to a report from the One Campaign and the World Bank.

Despite the serious subtext, Female Food Heroes takes a lighthearted approach. The farmers compete in all kinds of tasks over a 21-day period: selling goods on the side of the road, repairing mud walls and vaccinating goats. Viewers help determine the winner by voting for their favorite contestants.

Since the TV version of the program, Mama Shujaa wa Chakula, began airing in Tanzania in 2011, the show, in partnership with East Africa TV, has reached about 37 million viewers throughout the region, says Oxfam. And each season, nearly 3,000 female farmers vie for one of the 18 to 20 spots on the TV show.

The idea for the initiative came about after campaigners at a regional Oxfam meeting in Africa decided they needed to change how people were talking about female farmers. ""A lot of what we were doing for smallholder women farmers wasn't having an impact,"" says Eluka Kibona, who manages Oxfam's involvement with the show.

They wanted less of a ""pity party"" and more of a ""celebration that would give them the status they deserve,"" she adds.

And that's exactly what the program is doing: transforming African women farmers into advocates for agriculture issues.

Chelele, who won season five of Female Food Heroes in Tanzania, has become a community leader. In addition to the grand prize, which included about $10,000, 7 acres of land, and farming and fishing tools, she says in an email to NPR that she has ""generated a small amount of fame, which is wonderful.""

Now that she's a winner, the mother of four and the sole provider for her household educates people and family members in her village about different farming methods. A few times a month, she goes on the local radio station. People call in and ask her about her experiences as a farmer and a women's rights advocate. She answers questions like ""How do I learn to make manure?"" ""How did I modernize my farming technique?"" and of course, ""How do I get on the show?""

Since the television show began in Tanzania, Female Food Heroes competitions and award ceremonies  which Oxfam describes as kind of like a ""beauty pageant""  have been held in Ethiopia and Nigeria. But the program, which started in 2012, has its own set of winners, judges and contestants. Unfortunately, it's not aired on TV.

The contestants don't seem to mind  they're just glad they have a chance to win. Monica Maigari, an energetic 59-year-old farmer, was the first-runner up in Nigeria's 2014 Female Food Heroes challenge.

On top of winning $1,000, which she used to buy land, there are other perks. She's currently in Washington, D.C., helping Oxfam lobby Congress on U.S. legislation to improve global humanitarian response and give local groups the tools and resources they need to act when disaster strikes  an idea that Maigari can stand behind.

And now that she's become a leader in her village  where ""even the men"" respect her, she says  she will use her power to help women farmers. She wants them to learn how to read and write, learn how to use the machines that will pack their food in containers for supermarkets, and get their foodstuffs registered and vetted in Nigeria's version of the FDA.

Don't even get her started on mangoes. ""They drop down and we cannot preserve them, they just go to waste,"" she says. ""It's a serious problem. They rot and we cannot sell them at the market.""

Maigari, who visited NPR this week, noticed our building's rooftop garden, looking pretty dead thanks to winter, and happily gave us some good advice.

She likes that our box garden is ""well-manured,"" and says it would be great for carrots, tomatoes and spinach. But no more than four kinds of crops, she says  that way NPR can ""grow enough to sell at the market.""",[]

American intelligence officers are trained to tackle tough targets.

But there are tough targets, and then there's Russian President Vladimir Putin, who plays his cards so closely that it's hard for his own advisers to divine what he's thinking, says Gregory Treverton, chairman of the National Intelligence Council.

""Putin is so isolated that the chances that he might miscalculate and do something rash are top of my list for things I worry about,"" says Treverton. ""I am fond of distinguishing between puzzles  those things that have an answer, though we may not know it  and mysteries, those things that are iffy and contingent. And so how Putin is going to behave is presumably a mystery, and probably even a mystery to Putin.""

Treverton is not alone in this view.

Retired Adm. James Stavridis, commander of NATO forces from 2009 to 2013, says Putin is exceptional in how little he telegraphs.

""He certainly has a cabinet of close advisers,"" Stavridis says.""But at the end of the day, the strategic terrain is not on a map somewhere  it's in between Vladimir Putin's ears.""

That makes it hard for the CIA and other spy agencies charged with tracking Russian military and economic assets  and with anticipating what Moscow might do next on the conflict in Syria, tensions in Crimea and a wide range of other matters.

Stavridis, now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, points to a couple of factors that make Putin such a difficult target.

One is the degree of control he has amassed in his 17 years as either prime minister or president of Russia. You have to look to North Korea, Stavridis says, or to Fidel Castro's long reign in Cuba to find another ruler who wields such absolute power.

The tools of espionage  phone intercepts, satellite imagery and more  can sometimes overcome such disadvantages, but may be of limited use against Putin: He's a trained spy himself.

Vladimir Putin joined the KGB in 1975, and was sent to Dresden in East Germany in order to spy on the West during the Cold War. There he learned both near-flawless German and near-flawless spycraft.

""Russia has always had a very strong counterintelligence capability, and Putin would be well-schooled in this,"" says John McLaughlin, who served as acting director of the CIA in 2004, during Putin's first stint as president. McLaughlin says the aides in whom Putin might confide are mostly ex-KGB, too. ""The inner circle there would be very conscious of how they communicate, conscious of who meets whom. So it's a tough environment for intelligence.""

But McLauglin adds that if you can't peer into Putin's mind, you still can analyze the realities he's grappling with, which may inform his actions.

""In the case of Russia, you would look at the effect of sanctions, which have been very heavy on them,"" McLaughlin says. ""The fact that the ruble is now at kind of an all-time low, the fact that they have a serious capital-flight problem.""

There's also the fact that Putin has spoken openly about his overarching goal of re-establishing Russia as a major world power. It's up to the CIA and other spy agencies to figure out how he plans next to go about it.",[]

The new HBO series Vinyl explores the seedy underpinnings of the music business in the 1960s and '70s. The show, whose executive producers include Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, has been resurrecting and recreating great songs from those days in each Sunday night episode. One of the exciting ""cover"" tunes done for next week's show is ""Watch Your Step,"" an R&B song made famous by Bobby Parker in the summer of '61. Here it's covered by The Arcs. When we asked Dan Auerbach why the band played this song, he answered in a way that mimics the show: ""What Marty wants, Marty gets.""

""Watch Your Step"" is a tune whose influence  in particular Parker's guitar line  would be heard again and again in music in the early '60s, particularly in George Harrison's guitar line to The Beatles ""I Feel Fine"" and Jimmy Page's performance on Led Zeppelin's ""Moby Dick."" The song was a moderate hit in the U.K.

There's an 18 track collection of songs from the series that came out when the show launched, but Vinyl also has a series of mini soundtracks it releases each Friday tied to Sunday's episode. Along with The Arcs, here's what's on this week's show, and available as EP Volume 1.5.:

Given Iggy Pop's recent announcement that he may be retiring from the music business, it's been an introspective time for the rock giant. That might be part of why Pop's new album  a collaboration with Josh Homme  bears the title Post Pop Depression. Not that the album itself is quite as ominous as its name. Throughout its nine songs, Pop pipes in his most unctuous croon, a work of nature that's only become more monumental as it's eroded over the decades. But with Homme's acumen as the architect of Queens Of The Stone Age stirred into the mix, there's decadent ecstasy to the album that's as far from glum as you can get.

It is heavy, though. In addition to producing and co-writing Post Pop Depression, Homme provides guitar, bass, piano and backing vocals; also in the group are guitarist Dean Fertita (Homme's right-hand man in Queens Of The Stone Age, as well as Jack White's bandmate in The Dead Weather) and drummer Matt Helders of Arctic Monkeys. With that kind of lineup, it's clear that this isn't going to be any kind of retirement party, and Pop obliges his younger cohorts' zeal with plenty of his own. The album is all sharp angles and hard muscles, from the choppy, stomping riff of ""Break Into Your Heart"" to the splintered rage of ""Paraguay.""

""I have nothing but my name,"" Pop intones at the close of ""American Valhalla,"" his voice a study in smoke and gravel. For a man whose musical fortunes have seen many peaks and valleys  during some stretches of his long career, it has indeed felt as if Pop's name was all he had going for him  it's a chillingly vulnerable confession. But even when he lets out some morbid paranoia during ""In The Lobby"" (""My shadow is walking in front of me / And I hope I'm not losing my life tonight""), he seems more like a predator than prey.

Still, he never lets the album get too pensive. His spoken-word, expletive-laden, anti-laptop rant in ""Paraguay"" is the kind of get-off-my-lawn stuff that Pop has more than earned the right to unleash. But for every glimpse at the punk of old, Pop drops tender moments like ""Gardenia,"" a lush, catchy love song that's also ever-so-slightly eerie. The most sentimental moments, though, come when the band is clearly channeling Pop's high point as a solo artist: his collaborations with David Bowie in Berlin on the classic '70s albums The Idiot and Lust For Life. ""Sunday,"" for instance, unabashedly recalls that era with its skeletal yet punchy drumming, sculpted guitar and avant-garage edge.

In ""German Days,"" the record's most flagrantly nostalgic song, Homme and his team tap into the decadent, wiry menace of the Berlin albums while Pop glances back with rueful irony at Lust For Life: ""When your love of life is an empty beach / When it's painful to express the things you feel."" In lesser hands, that might come off as self-parody, but instead, the singer sounds like he's owning his legacy  and having a good time doing it, introspection notwithstanding. If Post Pop Depression does end up being Pop's last recorded hurrah, it's a worthy one.",[]

The finest country songwriters understand that the best way to a big idea is often through a small detail. Consider the central gesture that dictates the action in Brandy Clark's beautiful song ""I Cried,"" which appears on producer Dave Cobb's graceful compilation album Southern Family. Contemplating a grandfather's death and his wife's ensuing loneliness, Clark builds the song's chorus around the phrase, ""I cried,"" her voice arching up into a tender, transcendent falsetto; in the next line, she takes the mood down again. ""I tried to hold my head high, it ended up in my hands."" That simple image so effectively captures the experience of living with grief: the attempt to show strength for others, for your own sanity, and the gradual, quiet, repetitive sag into vulnerability. Who hasn't experienced this moment at a funeral  or, as Clark describes, while simply talking on the phone with a fellow loved one left behind? There's no need for an angel's trumpets here. ""I Cried"" says more about mortality with a sigh.

Southern Family collects such moments in a bouquet of memories and treasured sentiments, in the process coalescing into one of the subtlest concept albums to ever bear that dangerously pretentious descriptor. Inspired by the 1979 album White Mansions, a song cycle about the Civil War spearheaded by the writer Paul Kennerly and produced by Glyn Johns, Cobb's own effort doesn't adhere to a linear narrative the way its predecessor does. It's more like the way we tell tales now, in dialogue across social media, our individual experiences adding up to a collective portrait of our times.

Mainstream country stars and Americana favorites show why those separate categories are increasingly meaningless  at least in Cobb's world, where a strong composition and an unfussy live arrangement always get to the core of things. Miranda Lambert's hymnlike ""Sweet Bye And Bye"" complements Jason Isbell's righteous ""God Is A Working Man"" (a great campaign song for the right candidate, by the way). ""Mama's Table,"" a perfect ballad Jamey Johnson originally wrote for the Oak Ridge Boys and himself sings here, gets an answer from Zac Brown in ""Grandma's Garden."" John Paul White offers his own funeral confession in the heartrending ""Simple Song 1,"" while Anderson East confronts another life passage  parents' divorce  in ""Learning."" Alongside offerings by Holly Williams, Morgane and Chris Stapleton, Shooter Jennings, the excellent newcomer Brent Cobb (cousin of Dave), and Rich Robinson (who brings gospel into the mix via the Settles Connection chorus in the grand closer ""The Way Home""), these songs ground place and community in the experience of the everyday: a kid's bottle of Cheerwise, a brother's initials carved in Grandma's table, an old song that means something different when you sing it in nursery school and, later, to your own child.

Hotly anticipated as Dave Cobb's grand statement about the generation of mostly Southern artists who, with his help, are shifting the definitions of both country and Americana music, this collection succeeds by being as modest as its helmsman. ""Southern"" and ""family"" are both fraught terms  as are ""country"" and ""Americana""  but instead of trying to clearly define them, Cobb (who plays guitar in nearly every track) encouraged his collaborators to approach them gently. The 12 resulting songs reflect family structures that are in flux but which endure because of love and memory, in a South constructed at backyard parties and in mothers' kitchens more than in any legislature or historical site.

Southern Family also reflects the eclecticism of the music that's long emanated from Nashville and its environs. Clark's track, enhanced by pedal steel and Mellotron, is high countrypolitan class; East's has the Muscle Shoals swagger he's made his trademark. Lambert invokes the Southern gospel her song title recalls. Brent Cobb gets swampy in the comical ""Down Home,"" while White finds the place where folk music meets The Beatles. Bluegrass and blues and righteous Southern rock all find a place here. More than anything else, Southern Family is an argument for tradition as an organic concept, not an imposed one. Family is in the details, and to capture those details we have to listen to each other and accept the joy, the pain and the differences.",[]

Glenn Jones makes real albums. That may seem obvious for someone who has released six full-length solo records. But in the musical form that Jones practices  an instrumental acoustic-guitar tradition known as American Primitive  it's not a given. Because the style requires technical skill, it can be tempting to just rip out a few displays of finger-picked prowess, slap them together and call it all an album.

For Jones, that wouldn't be enough. His records are consistently thematic and thoughtful, exploring ideas that work together rather than merely occupying the same piece of vinyl. Fleeting is his most cohesive album. Each song flows naturally into the next, with motifs repeated in small variations and moods that connect across track breaks. Many of Jones' artistic concerns  places and environments, musical forefathers, the passage of time  arise simultaneously, as if they're branches of a single tree.

The bright lines of ""Flower Turned Inside-Out"" seem mirrored by the slower, more pensive shapes of ""Close To The Ground."" Bittersweet plucks in ""Mother's Day"" evoke holidays spent with loved ones, while similar meditations strike a more forward-looking tone in ""June Too Soon, October All Over."" Two pieces, ""Cleo Awake"" and ""Cleo Asleep,"" are literal counterparts, as Jones plays the same melody on banjo and guitar to mimic the cycle of morning and night. Perhaps that's why he called the album Fleeting  the emotions he explores may recur, but the days they inhabit keep passing by.

On that count, two songs feel especially poignant. The searching banjo piece ""Spokane River Falls"", named after the city in Washington where Jones was born, is like an internal, nostalgic conversation. Short, sweet phrases return like memories that refuse to fade. In ""Portrait Of Basho As A Young Dragon,"" Jones converses with one of his biggest influences, the late guitarist Robbie Basho. With delicate notes and decisive strums, Jones reckons with Basho's legacy and adds to it in the process. In that sense, he's time-traveling, moving backward and forward until the present blurs, turning something fleeting into something beautiful.",[]

When Florida voters go to vote on March 15, the state's voting machines may once again be in the spotlight.

Back in 2000, the nation's most spectacular elections meltdown took place in Florida thanks to the infamous paper butterfly ballots, ancient voting machines and poorly trained poll workers. The ensuing chaos led to a massive recount, a Supreme Court battle and a narrow victory for George W. Bush.

Between the international scrutiny and federal funds, most Florida counties bought new voting machines after that. But almost 16 years later, this generation of machines is nearing the end of its life.

""We don't expect our laptops or our desktops to last a decade, and that's the kind of consumer electronics and technology that these machines are using,"" says Christopher Famaghetti of New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, who worked on a report about the state of voting machines nationwide.

toggle caption Renata Sago/WMFE

In Polk County, Fla., poll workers in training fumble with clunky beige machines, among the oldest in the state. Like teachers grading Scantron tests, they feed paper ballots into the equipment. Some 280,000 voters are expected to head to the polls in this part of central Florida.

Longtime poll worker William Carroway calls optical scan machines ""reliable.""

""People like the idea that they actually put their ballot in,"" he says. ""They want to know their ballot was counted. They don't see that with the touch screen.""

The machines scan ballots with an infrared reader and the results are transmitted to the state capital, old school, through a dial up modem.

It's 1990s technology that the county first used, ironically, during the 2000 election. Unlike other parts of the state, Polk County didn't suffer any of the voting meltdowns other Florida counties did that year.

While state and federal elections experts agree optical scan units are reliable, the issue that arises is age: Problems crop up when they hit the 10 year mark. This year, 43 states will be using machines that are least that old, according to the Brennan Center report.

Optical scan units are prone to especially serious problems, ""things like motherboard failures, papers jams, the rollers that pull paper ballots into the machines can dry up over time,"" said Famaghetti.

One Florida county had to buy parts off eBay because the manufacturer no longer made them. Famaghetti estimates the cost of new voting machines across the country could exceed $1 billion, a tab states and counties would have to pay themselves.

But it's not just about the money, argues Polk County's Supervisor Of Elections Lori Edwards.

""This equipment is accurate. The poll workers enjoy working with it and our voters feel very comfortable with the equipment,"" Edwards says.



The latest model optical scan units take a digital photo of each ballot that can be saved to a flash drive. Edwards questions the utility of this technology update.

Her philosophy on updating the county's equipment? Don't worry.

""If every piece of this equipment died on Election Day, we have every single ballot and we know where it is and we know how to count those,"" Edwards says. ""It may take a while, but we're very comfortable to be able to rely on those easy to read ballots.""

This scenario is unlikely, Famaghetti says. He stresses, ""... nobody we spoke with said that all the machines are going to break down at once.""

But the machines will break down sooner or later, and Famaghetti says state and local governments will eventually need to find the money to replace them.



Meanwhile, Edwards says it will likely be at least two to four years before Polk County voters will slide their ballots through new machines. She is looking ahead to next week's primary.



""If we weren't confident, we wouldn't be doing it this way,"" says Edwards. ""This is much too important. You can't put a price tag on democracy.""",[]

Record numbers of airline passengers will soon be taking off for spring break, expecting to find fun.

But first, they'll have to get through the Transportation Security Administration screening at the airport. Definitely no fun there.

Both the TSA and Airlines For America (A4A), an industry trade group, say travelers should brace for long waits in epic lines. ""It's a very serious concern,"" A4A Senior Vice President Sharon Pinkerton said on a conference call with journalists Wednesday.

Earlier this week, the TSA released a statement saying it ""expects passenger volumes to drastically increase throughout the month of March as spring breakers take to the skies and throughout the summer.""

TSA's top advice: ""Arrive early.""

How early? Experts say passengers should get to the airport two hours before a domestic departure and three hours for international flights to clear the snaking security lines.

Pinkerton says TSA needs more screeners. ""The staffing is not adequate and it needs to be,"" she said. In addition, TSA equipment should be better maintained to avoid breakdowns, she said.

TSA doesn't deny such problems, saying they reflect recent federal budget cuts. Also, officers must take more time this year to examine bags to reduce heightened terrorism risks.

At a Senate hearing last week, TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger said his agency needs more funding to ""right-size and appropriately resource TSA and halt further reductions in officer staffing.""

The Obama administration is asking Congress to support 42,848 officers by boosting TSA's fiscal 2017 budget to $3 billion, which would be $26.9 million more than fiscal 2016. Currently, TSA has roughly 41,000 officers on duty.

The TSA troubles are coming at a time when travel has been surging, especially to sunny vacation destinations. For example, TSA says it expects 13 percent more volume at checkpoints in Orlando, Fla., this March, and 8.5 percent more at Fort Myers, Fla., compared with last year.

A4A chief economist John Heimlich, also on the conference call, said Americans definitely are in the mood to travel. He said he's confident that in 2015, passengers set a record. The Transportation Department is expected to release the final headcount at 11 a.m. ET Thursday.

Heimlich said he expects new records for 2016. He noted that for March and April  the peak time for spring break and Easter vacation travel  U.S. airlines are expecting about 140 million passengers, up from last year's record of 136.2 million. Back in 2007, before Americans hunkered down for the recession, the March and April total was 135.1 million.

Airlines are responding to the new normal. ""To meet the extra demand, airlines are deploying new and larger aircraft on many routes,"" Heimlich said.

The strong demand has been allowing carriers to boost fares on many routes, especially in smaller markets with less competition. But carriers also have been offering discounts on popular flights in competitive markets.

Overall, fares are up about $22 per round trip compared with last year, according to FareCompare.com, which tracks such changes.

Last year, when jet fuel prices were falling, airline operating expenses were dropping as well  down by $14 billion, or 9.5 percent, the A4A said. A portion of those savings were passed along to consumers in the form of a 5.1 percent decline in fares for all of 2015.

Lower fuel prices, combined with the higher demand for tickets, have been boosting airline earnings. The A4A report showed the industry collectively reported pretax earnings of $23.2 billion, resulting in a margin of 14.6 percent  up from 6 percent in 2014.

But the trade group also pointed out how tough the recession was on the boom-and-bust industry. Over the past five years, U.S. carriers made a pre-tax profit of about 5 percent, far lower than the 13.8 percent average of the S&P 500 during the same period.",[]

""I went looking for a new direction / Indecisive, undecided,"" Damien Jurado sings in ""Onalaska,"" one of the eeriest tracks on his new album, Visions Of Us On The Land. He's singing in character; there's nothing remotely indecisive or undecided about Visions. His direction, though, is indeed pretty new. The album is the final installment of a loose trilogy Jurado began with 2012's Maraqopa and continued on 2014's Brothers And Sisters Of The Eternal Son. This time around, he's delivered a sprawling, 17-song story arc that picks up where Brothers left off  that is to say, somewhere near the edge of terra incognita. After a car crash sends the trilogy's unnamed protagonist on some hazy kind of metaphysical odyssey, he's arrived at a state of existential bemusement, searching his psyche for answers. It's a heady concept, for sure, but one that Jurado anchors in gorgeous songwriting and lush, layered indie-folk arrangements.

That said, Visions isn't folky in a heart-on-the-sleeve kind of way. Jurado's no stranger to sad, sparse songs  he built his early career on them  but on Visions' ""Sam And Davy,"" for instance, he forgoes the acoustic confessional in favor of something far grander. Not to mention bleak: With minor chords, booming bass-drum detonations and menacing flourishes of synth, Jurado yanks the wheel and forces a detour into the depths of psychedelic reverie, asking, ""Does your blood run cold / Or your eyes go white / On a borrowed soul / And on borrowed time?"" In ""Prisms,"" Jurado channels one of his longtime heroes, Nick Drake; a more skeletal, guitar-plus-vocal track, it ponders the nature of memory as Jurado sings, ""Do we still go on / Long after rewind?"" His voice is so ghostly and echoing, it answers his own question.

Things don't exactly get upbeat from there  although ""Exit 353,"" the first song he wrote for the album, has more of a left hook to it. A propulsive, chillingly lonely dirge spiked with a distorted, tooth-rattling guitar riff, it contains yet another unsettling question (""Are we all not lost in song?"") whose response is self-evident. And in ""A.M. A.M.,"" Jurado's singsong, reverb-cushioned melody is as plush as it is haunting. Richard Swift, an accomplished singer-songwriter in his own right, once again provides the assist as both producer and guest instrumentalist; his shadowy atmospherics stand out in ""Mellow Blue Polka Dot,"" a cooing, catchy shuffle that recalls Bill Callahan's dark pop explorations.

Jurado has been playing the long game with his trilogy of albums, but the story arc doesn't come to a satisfying conclusion  nor should it. After the fingerpicked, Dylan-esque hush of ""Orphans In The Key Of E,"" Jurado wraps up the album with a glance over the shoulder: ""When I look back upon my time, see the snapshots of my life,"" he sings, ""You will not be surprised to see your name across my smile."" It's a small, welcome moment of sentimental peace, but it's fraught with its own ominous sense of loss as the refrain of ""I will remember you / The way you are right now"" begins to sound more like a fading distress signal than a comfort. As works of mood-altering music go, Jurado has upped the dosage with Visions. It's a harrowing trip, led by a guide who's all too familiar with the territory.",[]

Once upon a time, the Democratic National Committee had a plan for just four debates among the party's candidates for president. The general feeling among activists was that too many debates risked overexposing the candidates, their differences and the divisions within the party.

There had been too many debates, they felt, in 2008. It was just bad politics.

Now, some months later, the DNC has allowed eight debates, the latest in Miami on Wednesday night, sponsored by Univision and The Washington Post and broadcast on CNN. The first few debates were tucked into difficult time slots involving holidays or major sports events, but the latest have been relatively easy for the country as a whole to see.

The cast of contenders, originally five, has for more than a month now been down to two, one of whom will almost surely be the nominee. And judging by this latest clash, and the previous edition last Sunday night, it is easy to see why the DNC originally wanted the series to be shorter.

Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had at each other for two hours in each of these events, trading accusations and answering journalists' questions laden with accusations. Their various vulnerabilities and shortcomings have been clearly on display.

And while these last two debates were not nearly as raw and rivalrous as the most recent Republican debates, neither were they as collegial as the first two Democratic debates last fall.

Sanders ripped into Clinton for taking money from Wall Street in contributions and speaking fees. Clinton pounded Sanders for his vote against the 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill negotiated by the late Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy.

Again on Wednesday night, both candidates had plenty of partisans in the audience to provide cheers and applause, as well as occasional hoots and other expressions of disapproval for the media moderators.

Both candidates also had plenty of prepared material, much of which was already familiar. Sanders talked about the ""rigged economy"" and the ""corrupt campaign finance system,"" the inequality of income (most of the income growth since the 2009 recession going to the top 1 percent) and the failure of capitalism to care about its workers.

Clinton talked about the need to extend President Obama's policies in virtually every area of governance, from the Affordable Care Act to the Dodd-Frank regulation of the financial sector. She defended her many contributions from the Wall Street world of finance in part by saying President Obama had taken Wall Street money, too.

But Clinton, like Sanders, did not defend the current administration's policies on deportation of recent immigrants without legal status. Both said they would end the deportation of children and the breaking up of families. It was a major area of agreement during the evening.

Asked for a specific commitment regarding the deportation of children, Clinton said: ""I will not deport children, I will not deport children."" She then proceeded to detail her priorities for other categories of people that might be subject to deportation, including violent criminals and those who plot terrorist attacks.

Sanders also disavowed child deportation, as well as the Obama administration's deportation policies, which have repatriated many thousands. He decried the very idea of mass deportations of the 11 million undocumented people now estimated to be in the U.S. While not contemplated by most of the policy community, just such a deportation is a cornerstone of the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

Clinton called Trump's ""very tall"" wall on the Mexican border ""a fantasy.""

Given the setting, the sponsors and the audience, questions about immigration were a natural centerpiece for the debate. But the questioners also touched on the vacancy on the Supreme Court, the minimum wage and a separate set of vulnerabilities unique to each.

Sanders was asked about a 1985 video in which he criticized the U.S. for its interventionist policies in Latin America, particularly regarding Cuba. He had some praise, in the video, for the Castro regime on that island.

Sanders did not repudiate the views in the video and said the U.S. had overstepped the enforcement of the Monroe Doctrine regarding its security in the hemisphere.

Clinton was challenged regarding her handling of her private email server and also her allegedly misleading remarks to the families of U.S. personnel after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. Both issues are fraught with political peril as both have been focal points for Republicans.

At one point, moderator Jorge Ramos of Univision asked her point-blank if she would withdraw from the race if indicted for the email arrangement.

""Oh for goodness ... "" Clinton began. ""That's not going to happen. I'm not even going to answer that question.""

Clinton was also put on the spot to explain her loss this week in the Michigan primary, which polls had predicted she would win easily. She smiled and said she had still received more votes and more delegates than Sanders that day because Michigan was such a close vote and her victory in Mississippi had been overwhelming.

Next week, the two candidates again face off in voting in varied parts of the country: Florida, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina and Missouri. While not as numerous as the states on ""Super Tuesday,"" these five are among the most populous states in the country and therefore supply a comparable payoff in terms of delegates. Their cumulative impact could be even greater.

Clinton has already passed the halfway point in pursuit of the 2,383 delegates needed to be nominated in Philadelphia in July. But Sanders' narrow win in Michigan changed the narrative again and raised questions about the reliability of polls in other states where Clinton has had a lead.

The failure of the pollsters and media to foresee Sanders' win in Michigan, where he had been behind by as much as 20 points and more, has cast doubt on all the tools used by observers to foresee results in any election.

That has been good news for Sanders' enthusiasts, who had a field day mocking their antagonists.",[]

i toggle caption AP AP

The Cleveland Clinic says it has removed a transplanted uterus  the first-ever in the U.S.  after the patient suffered from a ""sudden complication.""

The clinic conducted the landmark operation in late February. As we reported, the procedure is intended to ""open up another possible path to parenthood besides surrogacy or adoption for U.S. women who do not have a uterus, or who have a uterus that does not function.""

The transplant was part of a study that the clinic says is meant to include 10 women with uterine factor infertility, meaning ""they were born without a uterus, have lost their uterus, or have a uterus that no longer functions."" The clinic says in a statement that the study will continue despite this setback.

It has provided no details about the reason for the transplant's failure. ""At this time, the circumstance of the complication is under review and more information will be shared as it becomes available,"" the statement reads. The patient, identified only by her first name Lindsey, is ""doing well and recovering.""

Before the complication, the 26-year-old transplant recipient gave a statement at a press conference, carried by Fox 8 Cleveland. She said she was told she could not have children when she was 16. ""And from that moment on, I have prayed that God would allow me the opportunity to experience pregnancy. And here we are today at the beginning of that journey.""

Lindsey thanked her doctors after the procedure failed, saying in the statement: ""I just wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude towards all of my doctors. They acted very quickly to ensure my health and safety.""

For Muslim-Americans, there was a world before Sept. 11 and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and one after. Now, their community faces the dual threats of extremism and growing atheism.

Young Muslim-Americans are angry and frustrated, but not necessarily for the reasons you might think. While bound by their religion and their community, they have opinions as diverse as their backgrounds.

NPR's Tom Gjelten met a group of young American Muslims to discuss the challenges they see ahead for their community. Below, meet the participants; be sure to click the audio link above to hear their spirited conversation.

On how ISIS challenges American Muslims to think more critically

ISIS preys on our inability to walk and chew gum at the same time. It's making us think more critically. It's making us look critically at the way our media tells stories about how this happens. It's making us think and look critically at American foreign policy. It's making us think and look critically at the way we construct Islam in America.

On how ISIS thrives on ignorance and lack of critical thinking

ISIS is not doing these things just nilly-willy. They're very methodic. So as a Muslim if you go and you try to refute them, you're likely going to fail, because they'll be quoting scripture, sayings of the Prophet, historical events from early Islam. And most Muslims don't have that. They're not equipped with the proper knowledge, and so ISIS thrives on our own ignorance and our lack of critical thinking.

On the growth in both extremism and atheism

On one extreme, you have the yahoos, right? And they're going to go and be attracted by that rhetoric.

i toggle caption Michael W. Bunch/Courtesy of the artist Michael W. Bunch/Courtesy of the artist

The finest country songwriters understand that the best way to a big idea is often through a small detail. Consider the central gesture that dictates the action in Brandy Clark's beautiful song ""I Cried,"" which appears on producer Dave Cobb's graceful compilation album Southern Family. Contemplating a grandfather's death and his wife's ensuing loneliness, Clark builds the song's chorus around the phrase, ""I cried,"" her voice arching up into a tender, transcendent falsetto; in the next line, she takes the mood down again. ""I tried to hold my head high, it ended up in my hands."" That simple image so effectively captures the experience of living with grief: the attempt to show strength for others, for your own sanity, and the gradual, quiet, repetitive sag into vulnerability. Who hasn't experienced this moment at a funeral  or, as Clark describes, while simply talking on the phone with a fellow loved one left behind? There's no need for an angel's trumpets here. ""I Cried"" says more about mortality with a sigh.

Southern Family collects such moments in a bouquet of memories and treasured sentiments, in the process coalescing into one of the subtlest concept albums to ever bear that dangerously pretentious descriptor. Inspired by the 1979 album White Mansions, a song cycle about the Civil War spearheaded by the writer Paul Kennerly and produced by Glyn Johns, Cobb's own effort doesn't adhere to a linear narrative the way its predecessor does. It's more like the way we tell tales now, in dialogue across social media, our individual experiences adding up to a collective portrait of our times.

Mainstream country stars and Americana favorites show why those separate categories are increasingly meaningless  at least in Cobb's world, where a strong composition and an unfussy live arrangement always get to the core of things. Miranda Lambert's hymnlike ""Sweet Bye And Bye"" complements Jason Isbell's righteous ""God Is A Working Man"" (a great campaign song for the right candidate, by the way). ""Mama's Table,"" a perfect ballad Jamey Johnson originally wrote for the Oak Ridge Boys and himself sings here, gets an answer from Zac Brown in ""Grandma's Garden."" John Paul White offers his own funeral confession in the heartrending ""Simple Song 1,"" while Anderson East confronts another life passage  parents' divorce  in ""Learning."" Alongside offerings by Holly Williams, Morgane and Chris Stapleton, Shooter Jennings, the excellent newcomer Brent Cobb (cousin of Dave), and Rich Robinson (who brings gospel into the mix via the Settles Connection chorus in the grand closer ""The Way Home""), these songs ground place and community in the experience of the everyday: a kid's bottle of Cheerwise, a brother's initials carved in Grandma's table, an old song that means something different when you sing it in nursery school and, later, to your own child.

Hotly anticipated as Dave Cobb's grand statement about the generation of mostly Southern artists who, with his help, are shifting the definitions of both country and Americana music, this collection succeeds by being as modest as its helmsman. ""Southern"" and ""family"" are both fraught terms  as are ""country"" and ""Americana""  but instead of trying to clearly define them, Cobb (who plays guitar in nearly every track) encouraged his collaborators to approach them gently. The 12 resulting songs reflect family structures that are in flux but which endure because of love and memory, in a South constructed at backyard parties and in mothers' kitchens more than in any legislature or historical site.

Southern Family also reflects the eclecticism of the music that's long emanated from Nashville and its environs. Clark's track, enhanced by pedal steel and Mellotron, is high countrypolitan class; East's has the Muscle Shoals swagger he's made his trademark. Lambert invokes the Southern gospel her song title recalls. Brent Cobb gets swampy in the comical ""Down Home,"" while White finds the place where folk music meets The Beatles. Bluegrass and blues and righteous Southern rock all find a place here. More than anything else, Southern Family is an argument for tradition as an organic concept, not an imposed one. Family is in the details, and to capture those details we have to listen to each other and accept the joy, the pain and the differences.",[]

Once upon a time, the Democratic National Committee had a plan for just four debates among the party's candidates for president. The general feeling among activists was that too many debates risked overexposing the candidates, their differences and the divisions within the party.

There had been too many debates, they felt, in 2008. It was just bad politics.

Now, some months later, the DNC has allowed eight debates, the latest in Miami on Wednesday night, sponsored by Univision and The Washington Post and broadcast on CNN. The first few debates were tucked into difficult time slots involving holidays or major sports events, but the latest have been relatively easy for the country as a whole to see.

The cast of contenders, originally five, has for more than a month now been down to two, one of whom will almost surely be the nominee. And judging by this latest clash, and the previous edition last Sunday night, it is easy to see why the DNC originally wanted the series to be shorter.

Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had at each other for two hours in each of these events, trading accusations and answering journalists' questions laden with accusations. Their various vulnerabilities and shortcomings have been clearly on display.

And while these last two debates were not nearly as raw and rivalrous as the most recent Republican debates, neither were they as collegial as the first two Democratic debates last fall.

Sanders ripped into Clinton for taking money from Wall Street in contributions and speaking fees. Clinton pounded Sanders for his vote against the 2007 comprehensive immigration reform bill negotiated by the late Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy.

Again on Wednesday night, both candidates had plenty of partisans in the audience to provide cheers and applause, as well as occasional hoots and other expressions of disapproval for the media moderators.

Both candidates also had plenty of prepared material, much of which was already familiar. Sanders talked about the ""rigged economy"" and the ""corrupt campaign finance system,"" the inequality of income (most of the income growth since the 2009 recession going to the top 1 percent) and the failure of capitalism to care about its workers.

Clinton talked about the need to extend President Obama's policies in virtually every area of governance, from the Affordable Care Act to the Dodd-Frank regulation of the financial sector. She defended her many contributions from the Wall Street world of finance in part by saying President Obama had taken Wall Street money, too.

But Clinton, like Sanders, did not defend the current administration's policies on deportation of recent immigrants without legal status. Both said they would end the deportation of children and the breaking up of families. It was a major area of agreement during the evening.

Asked for a specific commitment regarding the deportation of children, Clinton said: ""I will not deport children, I will not deport children."" She then proceeded to detail her priorities for other categories of people that might be subject to deportation, including violent criminals and those who plot terrorist attacks.

Sanders also disavowed child deportation, as well as the Obama administration's deportation policies, which have repatriated many thousands. He decried the very idea of mass deportations of the 11 million undocumented people now estimated to be in the U.S. While not contemplated by most of the policy community, just such a deportation is a cornerstone of the campaign of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

Clinton called Trump's ""very tall"" wall on the Mexican border ""a fantasy.""

Given the setting, the sponsors and the audience, questions about immigration were a natural centerpiece for the debate. But the questioners also touched on the vacancy on the Supreme Court, the minimum wage and a separate set of vulnerabilities unique to each.

Sanders was asked about a 1985 video in which he criticized the U.S. for its interventionist policies in Latin America, particularly regarding Cuba. He had some praise, in the video, for the Castro regime on that island.

Sanders did not repudiate the views in the video and said the U.S. had overstepped the enforcement of the Monroe Doctrine regarding its security in the hemisphere.

Clinton was challenged regarding her handling of her private email server and also her allegedly misleading remarks to the families of U.S. personnel after the terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012. Both issues are fraught with political peril as both have been focal points for Republicans.

At one point, moderator Jorge Ramos of Univision asked her point-blank if she would withdraw from the race if indicted for the email arrangement.

""Oh for goodness ... "" Clinton began. ""That's not going to happen. I'm not even going to answer that question.""

Clinton was also put on the spot to explain her loss this week in the Michigan primary, which polls had predicted she would win easily. She smiled and said she had still received more votes and more delegates than Sanders that day because Michigan was such a close vote and her victory in Mississippi had been overwhelming.

Next week, the two candidates again face off in voting in varied parts of the country: Florida, Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina and Missouri. While not as numerous as the states on ""Super Tuesday,"" these five are among the most populous states in the country and therefore supply a comparable payoff in terms of delegates. Their cumulative impact could be even greater.

Clinton has already passed the halfway point in pursuit of the 2,383 delegates needed to be nominated in Philadelphia in July. But Sanders' narrow win in Michigan changed the narrative again and raised questions about the reliability of polls in other states where Clinton has had a lead.

The failure of the pollsters and media to foresee Sanders' win in Michigan, where he had been behind by as much as 20 points and more, has cast doubt on all the tools used by observers to foresee results in any election.

That has been good news for Sanders' enthusiasts, who had a field day mocking their antagonists.",[]

You might call it old wine in new bottles, but what sweet, masterfully crafted wine it is. Upheld by Stillness, the debut album by the young and vibrant British a cappella choir ORA, presents a contemporary twist on a 16th-century classic.

The group, founded in 2014 by Artistic Director Suzi Digby, asked a handful of today's choral composers to create a musical response to William Byrd's Mass for Five Voices, an intricate, richly scored polyphonic work popular with choirs around the world. Each composer took inspiration from one of the five movements of the Mass, while Byrd's original (written around 1595) forms the centerpiece of the album.

Roxanna Panufnik (daughter of the late Polish composer Andrzej Panufnik) chose Byrd's Kyrie, the traditional mass opener which pleads for God's mercy (""Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison"").

Beginning and ending in hushed reverence, Panufnik's version slowly blooms in contemporary harmonies. Voices interweave in dusky colors, pierced by strands of white light from the upper ranges of ORA's beautifully blended sopranos. Two minutes in, the piece pauses on a lovely drone from the basses, before the vocal engine chugs back up to speed  ominous and inevitable.

Hot blue lightning seems to crackle, Star-Wars-Emperor-style, across the surface of The Complete Wimmen's Comix. Its title is a cheeky riff on the renaming passion that consumed feminism in the early '70s, and its two volumes come in a (actually rather ugly) salmon-colored box decorated with examples of the series' highly inconsistent artwork. The whole bulky thing feels like a suitcase bomb packed with jagged hunks of social revolution. And that energy keeps sparking throughout the 704 pages of this frenetic, anarchic, occasionally kamikaze production.

It's hard to think of an aspect of women's lives, real or fantastical, that Wimmen's Comix doesn't touch on. In 1971's ""Breaking Out,"" a cabal of female comics characters  including Little Lulu, Betty and Veronica, and Petunia Pig  rise up against sexist double standards. (Betty and Veronica picket outside the high school, demanding classes in karate and women's history.) In Joyce Farmer's 1975 ""Equal Rites,"" a dozen naked witches hold a birthing ritual to summon their forbears' spirits from outer space. Cecelia Capuana's ""Modemorphose,"" from 1985, shows women's bodies changing to reflect the strangeness of female fashion: The figures grow huge bottoms, uni-bosoms or multiple legs that stick out in all directions.

Many of the artists fantasize about crime. In 1976's ""Petite Morte,"" Joey Epstein envisions an all-woman street gang called the Tenderettes that rolls men for drug money  until one gang member develops a strange and lethal passion for their marks. In Melinda Gebbie's 1976 ""The Confectionary,"" a sex-starved woman holds up a couple, kills the woman and rapes the man. Sharon Rudahl tells of a woman helping her son escape from a Mexican jail in ""Jailbreak at Hermosillo.""

Some artists simply turn a wry eye on the mundanities of life. In 1988, Mary Fleener recalls her friendship with a self-dramatizing ""Trauma Mama."" In Teresa Richards' 1976 ""Chapstick,"" a woman fantasizes a steamy, explicit tryst on an elevator, then settles down to watch ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.""

It's genuinely painful to imagine the radical, clashing perspectives that might have been found in these pages if the collective had only reached out to more women of color.

It may be hard to see how ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"" and female-on-male rape can find homes in the same publication. But there's a strong, common current of energy unifying Wimmen's Comix. That's partly because some feminist issues, like abortion, are as fraught today as they were back in 1971. It's also because the collective seems to have remained mostly white, as far as can be judged from the photos in the introduction and the skin tone that predominates in the comics. It's genuinely painful to imagine the radical, clashing perspectives that might have been found in these pages if the collective had only reached out to more women of color.

They did reach out to a huge number of contributors  apparently regardless of artistic talent. The artwork is a total grab bag, ranging from the polished creations of Rudahl, Trina Robbins, Phoebe Gloeckner and Dot Bucher to painfully amateurish doodles by creators better left unnamed. Mixed in is subversive work in which wild, even ugly scrawls evoke an unnerving sense of chaos (Dori Seda, Diane Noomin and the perennially obstreperous Aline Kominsky-Crumb). There's even the occasional contribution from a soon-to-be-notable name (Lynda Barry, Alison Bechdel, Julie Doucet).

There's one more reason for the unity of spirit in Wimmen's Comix: These these artists, all clearly in agreement that ""the personal is political,"" are much more comfortable with the first half of that pairing. They do tackle equal pay for equal work in the publication's early years and AIDS in later ones, with a dizzying assortment of topics in between. Rape, prostitution, sexual harassment, vegetarian cooking, science fiction, gothic romances, socks, bondage, nuns, farting, motorcycles and magic all feature in these pages. There are feminist fairy tales, stories of Harriet Tubman and Julia Pastrana, the Ugliest Woman in the World, a board game, and a pointillist study of a cervix. There's even a 3-D issue (glasses included).

Still, though, these comics largely stick to the personal, to relationships and fantasies and the absurdities of everyday life. Whether it's 1971 or 1989, the contributors' favorite topics are self-definition and men, men, men. (Not to mention sex, sex, sex. Everyone is doing it in these pages, including cats and bugs.)

This says something about the nature of women and the nature of comics. It may be that, however revolutionary women's goals are, our first impulse is always to change ourselves before we take on the world at large. And it seems that no matter how talented the artist, it's just really hard to be funny about equal pay for equal work.

Record numbers of airline passengers will soon be taking off for spring break, expecting to find fun.

But first, they'll have to get through the Transportation Security Administration screening at the airport. Definitely no fun there.

Both the TSA and Airlines For America (A4A), an industry trade group, say travelers should brace for long waits in epic lines. ""It's a very serious concern,"" A4A Senior Vice President Sharon Pinkerton said on a conference call with journalists Wednesday.

Earlier this week, the TSA released a statement saying it ""expects passenger volumes to drastically increase throughout the month of March as spring breakers take to the skies and throughout the summer.""

TSA's top advice: ""Arrive early.""

How early? Experts say passengers should get to the airport two hours before a domestic departure and three hours for international flights to clear the snaking security lines.

Pinkerton says TSA needs more screeners. ""The staffing is not adequate and it needs to be,"" she said. In addition, TSA equipment should be better maintained to avoid breakdowns, she said.

TSA doesn't deny such problems, saying they reflect recent federal budget cuts. Also, officers must take more time this year to examine bags to reduce heightened terrorism risks.

At a Senate hearing last week, TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger said his agency needs more funding to ""right-size and appropriately resource TSA and halt further reductions in officer staffing.""

The Obama administration is asking Congress to support 42,848 officers by boosting TSA's fiscal 2017 budget to $3 billion, which would be $26.9 million more than fiscal 2016. Currently, TSA has roughly 41,000 officers on duty.

The TSA troubles are coming at a time when travel has been surging, especially to sunny vacation destinations. For example, TSA says it expects 13 percent more volume at checkpoints in Orlando, Fla., this March, and 8.5 percent more at Fort Myers, Fla., compared with last year.

A4A chief economist John Heimlich, also on the conference call, said Americans definitely are in the mood to travel. He said he's confident that in 2015, passengers set a record. The Transportation Department is expected to release the final headcount at 11 a.m. ET Thursday.

Heimlich said he expects new records for 2016. He noted that for March and April  the peak time for spring break and Easter vacation travel  U.S. airlines are expecting about 140 million passengers, up from last year's record of 136.2 million. Back in 2007, before Americans hunkered down for the recession, the March and April total was 135.1 million.

Airlines are responding to the new normal. ""To meet the extra demand, airlines are deploying new and larger aircraft on many routes,"" Heimlich said.

The strong demand has been allowing carriers to boost fares on many routes, especially in smaller markets with less competition. But carriers also have been offering discounts on popular flights in competitive markets.

Overall, fares are up about $22 per round trip compared with last year, according to FareCompare.com, which tracks such changes.

Last year, when jet fuel prices were falling, airline operating expenses were dropping as well  down by $14 billion, or 9.5 percent, the A4A said. A portion of those savings were passed along to consumers in the form of a 5.1 percent decline in fares for all of 2015.

Glenn Jones makes real albums. That may seem obvious for someone who has released six full-length solo records. But in the musical form that Jones practices  an instrumental acoustic-guitar tradition known as American Primitive  it's not a given. Because the style requires technical skill, it can be tempting to just rip out a few displays of finger-picked prowess, slap them together and call it all an album.

For Jones, that wouldn't be enough. His records are consistently thematic and thoughtful, exploring ideas that work together rather than merely occupying the same piece of vinyl. Fleeting is his most cohesive album. Each song flows naturally into the next, with motifs repeated in small variations and moods that connect across track breaks. Many of Jones' artistic concerns  places and environments, musical forefathers, the passage of time  arise simultaneously, as if they're branches of a single tree.

The bright lines of ""Flower Turned Inside-Out"" seem mirrored by the slower, more pensive shapes of ""Close To The Ground."" Bittersweet plucks in ""Mother's Day"" evoke holidays spent with loved ones, while similar meditations strike a more forward-looking tone in ""June Too Soon, October All Over."" Two pieces, ""Cleo Awake"" and ""Cleo Asleep,"" are literal counterparts, as Jones plays the same melody on banjo and guitar to mimic the cycle of morning and night. Perhaps that's why he called the album Fleeting  the emotions he explores may recur, but the days they inhabit keep passing by.

On that count, two songs feel especially poignant. The searching banjo piece ""Spokane River Falls"", named after the city in Washington where Jones was born, is like an internal, nostalgic conversation. Short, sweet phrases return like memories that refuse to fade. In ""Portrait Of Basho As A Young Dragon,"" Jones converses with one of his biggest influences, the late guitarist Robbie Basho. With delicate notes and decisive strums, Jones reckons with Basho's legacy and adds to it in the process. In that sense, he's time-traveling, moving backward and forward until the present blurs, turning something fleeting into something beautiful.",[]

In 1962, George Martin signed an unknown band: The Beatles. Steve Inskeep talks to Ray Connolly, who made a documentary series with Martin called The Rhythm of Life, about Martin's death at age 90.

STEVE INSKEEP, HOST:

We are remembering Sir George Martin, who died yesterday at the age of 90. In 1962, while working for a British record label, he signed an unknown band called The Beatles. We're going to talk now with author and filmmaker Ray Connolly, who interviewed The Beatles many times and also made a documentary series with George Martin about music called ""The Rhythm Of Life."" Welcome to the program, sir.

RAY CONNOLLY: Good morning.

INSKEEP: Producer can be so many things for a musical group. What was Martin's job, really, with The Beatles?

CONNOLLY: He was the arranger. When they'd bring a song in, he's listen to it and say, well, you know, this is - this is OK. But have you thought about doing it in four-four time or maybe doing three-four time? That sort of thing - and then he would add all these instruments. He would sort of say, well, you know, that's great. But what else can you do? And then The Beatles would sort of throw out ideas themselves. So they would work in very, very close collaboration. The great thing about it was that George Martin knew everything there was to know about classical music. The Beatles knew whatever there was to know about rock n roll but nothing about classical music. So you put the two together - fantastic symbiosis. And so George took The Beatles from just rock n roll to ""Penny Lane,"" ""Strawberry Fields Forever,"" ""Sgt. Pepper.""

INSKEEP: And added sophistication to the music, I would imagine.

CONNOLLY: Absolutely.

INSKEEP: What you're describing is the role of an editor, really, which can be psychologically challenging for the artist because Martin is the guy telling you your song is not right or your song is not complete. They must have really trusted him.

CONNOLLY: Well, yeah, at first, you know, they would do whatever he said because, you know, he was the boss. He was like a schoolteacher. And that's the way he came across all the time. He was like a schoolteacher. And he helped them. And then later on, of course, they wanted to have more say. In the end, when they finished - when they finished recording together, John Lennon - and actually John was being a bit mean about this. He kind of said, well, you know, we want to do it ourselves now. They weren't as good without George Martin.

INSKEEP: Did they resent it a little bit when there were stories suggesting that Martin was the guy who was...

CONNOLLY: Yeah, I think they did. I think John did. But then later on, he and George got together. And I remember George telling me how he'd been talking to John. And John had said, I wish I could record the songs again. George said, well, which songs, John? He said, all of them. But with George Martin doing it, you know.

INSKEEP: Oh, my goodness.

CONNOLLY: He was that important, you know.

INSKEEP: And when you listen to Beatles music, is there something - or anybody's music, really - is there something that causes you to say, that's George Martin? That's George Martin in there.

CONNOLLY: I can certainly do it on Beatle records because I know exactly what he did. On ""Penny Lane,"" played piano - he introduced the piccolo and the trumpet (ph), things like that. You know, if The Beatles hadn't met George Martin, they'd have been a fantastic rock 'n' roll band. Because they met George Martin, who would take them, you know, in other directions, they were much more interesting.

INSKEEP: Can I just mention there's something about Beatles music that feels timeless? There's so much music from the '60s that might be great music. But it's music from the '60s. The Beatles' music feels a little different to me. Was that George Martin's influence, particularly that classical music influence you mentioned?

CONNOLLY: I think it was partly that. I think, you know, rock 'n' roll is - it's American music. The Beatles took it further. And they made it English music - very, very English music. So you know, I mean, songs like ""Penny Lane,"" they are very English. And that's partly George too. I mean, when Paul sang ""When I'm 64,"" that was like an old-time English musical song. Well, George know how to do it, you know? Paul would say, well, what about this? And George would say, well, hang on. I've got an idea. At Abbey Road where they recorded, there was this sort of band room and these old instruments there. And the boys would bring things out and say, what does this sound like? And George would say, well, you can do this and do that with it, you know? Add a harpsichord here. Add this. Add that - you know? - fantastic.

INSKEEP: You said another interesting thing I hadn't thought about. We think of this British group that grabbed an American music style and even played, you know, old American tunes on some of their early records.

CONNOLLY: Yeah.

INSKEEP: But you're saying that Martin was the one who made them what they really were.

CONNOLLY: I think he was. I think he was. And I mean, The Beatles may say, no, we could do it without him. But I doubt it. I think George brought a hell of a lot to them.

INSKEEP: Author and filmmaker Ray Connolly, who knew George Martin for many years. Thanks very much.

CONNOLLY: You're welcome.

Despite controlling Myanmar's newly sworn-in parliament, the party led by Aung San Suu Kyi can't name her as a presidential candidate because she's ineligible under constitutional rules. Conceding that point Thursday, Suu Kyi wrote an apology to her supporters.

The Nobel Peace laureate released a letter Thursday explaining the situation and apologizing for ""not fully fulfilling the people's desire"" by becoming their president, according to Voice of America. Suu Kyi also pledged to keep pursuing the post through peaceful means, even as her party, the National League for Democracy, put forth candidates to act as her proxy.

From Beijing, NPR's Anthony Kuhn reports:

""Suu Kyi met with military leaders several times to try to persuade them to change the country's military-drafted constitution. It bars her from becoming president because her children are foreign citizens. But the generals wouldn't budge. ""Instead, Suu Kyi's party has nominated 70-year-old Htin Kyaw as the front-runner to stand in for her. He's a close ally of hers, an Oxford graduate, and former political prisoner. ""Suu Kyi's party holds a majority in parliament, so when it votes on candidates later this month, Htin Kyaw should be a shoo-in.""

In Myanmar's political system, the president is selected by parliament from three candidates who are first nominated to be vice president. (The two losers retain those posts.) An election could come by the end of next week, with the new president assuming office on April 1.

When her party trounced the competition in elections last fall, Suu Kyi said she would be ""above the president."" She added, ""I'll run the government and we'll have a president who will work in accordance with the policies of the NLD.""",[]

When Florida voters go to vote on March 15, the state's voting machines may once again be in the spotlight.

Back in 2000, the nation's most spectacular elections meltdown took place in Florida thanks to the infamous paper butterfly ballots, ancient voting machines and poorly trained poll workers. The ensuing chaos led to a massive recount, a Supreme Court battle and a narrow victory for George W. Bush.

Between the international scrutiny and federal funds, most Florida counties bought new voting machines after that. But almost 16 years later, this generation of machines is nearing the end of its life.

""We don't expect our laptops or our desktops to last a decade, and that's the kind of consumer electronics and technology that these machines are using,"" says Christopher Famaghetti of New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, who worked on a report about the state of voting machines nationwide.

toggle caption Renata Sago/WMFE

In Polk County, Fla., poll workers in training fumble with clunky beige machines, among the oldest in the state. Like teachers grading Scantron tests, they feed paper ballots into the equipment. Some 280,000 voters are expected to head to the polls in this part of central Florida.

Longtime poll worker William Carroway calls optical scan machines ""reliable.""

""People like the idea that they actually put their ballot in,"" he says. ""They want to know their ballot was counted. They don't see that with the touch screen.""

The machines scan ballots with an infrared reader and the results are transmitted to the state capital, old school, through a dial up modem.

It's 1990s technology that the county first used, ironically, during the 2000 election. Unlike other parts of the state, Polk County didn't suffer any of the voting meltdowns other Florida counties did that year.

While state and federal elections experts agree optical scan units are reliable, the issue that arises is age: Problems crop up when they hit the 10 year mark. This year, 43 states will be using machines that are least that old, according to the Brennan Center report.

Optical scan units are prone to especially serious problems, ""things like motherboard failures, papers jams, the rollers that pull paper ballots into the machines can dry up over time,"" said Famaghetti.

One Florida county had to buy parts off eBay because the manufacturer no longer made them. Famaghetti estimates the cost of new voting machines across the country could exceed $1 billion, a tab states and counties would have to pay themselves.

But it's not just about the money, argues Polk County's Supervisor Of Elections Lori Edwards.

""This equipment is accurate. The poll workers enjoy working with it and our voters feel very comfortable with the equipment,"" Edwards says.



The latest model optical scan units take a digital photo of each ballot that can be saved to a flash drive. Edwards questions the utility of this technology update.

Her philosophy on updating the county's equipment? Don't worry.

""If every piece of this equipment died on Election Day, we have every single ballot and we know where it is and we know how to count those,"" Edwards says. ""It may take a while, but we're very comfortable to be able to rely on those easy to read ballots.""

This scenario is unlikely, Famaghetti says. He stresses, ""... nobody we spoke with said that all the machines are going to break down at once.""

But the machines will break down sooner or later, and Famaghetti says state and local governments will eventually need to find the money to replace them.



Meanwhile, Edwards says it will likely be at least two to four years before Polk County voters will slide their ballots through new machines. She is looking ahead to next week's primary.



""If we weren't confident, we wouldn't be doing it this way,"" says Edwards. ""This is much too important. You can't put a price tag on democracy.""",[]

American intelligence officers are trained to tackle tough targets.

But there are tough targets, and then there's Russian President Vladimir Putin, who plays his cards so closely that it's hard for his own advisers to divine what he's thinking, says Gregory Treverton, chairman of the National Intelligence Council.

""Putin is so isolated that the chances that he might miscalculate and do something rash are top of my list for things I worry about,"" says Treverton. ""I am fond of distinguishing between puzzles  those things that have an answer, though we may not know it  and mysteries, those things that are iffy and contingent. And so how Putin is going to behave is presumably a mystery, and probably even a mystery to Putin.""

Treverton is not alone in this view.

Retired Adm. James Stavridis, commander of NATO forces from 2009 to 2013, says Putin is exceptional in how little he telegraphs.

""He certainly has a cabinet of close advisers,"" Stavridis says.""But at the end of the day, the strategic terrain is not on a map somewhere  it's in between Vladimir Putin's ears.""

That makes it hard for the CIA and other spy agencies charged with tracking Russian military and economic assets  and with anticipating what Moscow might do next on the conflict in Syria, tensions in Crimea and a wide range of other matters.

Stavridis, now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, points to a couple of factors that make Putin such a difficult target.

One is the degree of control he has amassed in his 17 years as either prime minister or president of Russia. You have to look to North Korea, Stavridis says, or to Fidel Castro's long reign in Cuba to find another ruler who wields such absolute power.

The tools of espionage  phone intercepts, satellite imagery and more  can sometimes overcome such disadvantages, but may be of limited use against Putin: He's a trained spy himself.

Vladimir Putin joined the KGB in 1975, and was sent to Dresden in East Germany in order to spy on the West during the Cold War. There he learned both near-flawless German and near-flawless spycraft.

""Russia has always had a very strong counterintelligence capability, and Putin would be well-schooled in this,"" says John McLaughlin, who served as acting director of the CIA in 2004, during Putin's first stint as president. McLaughlin says the aides in whom Putin might confide are mostly ex-KGB, too. ""The inner circle there would be very conscious of how they communicate, conscious of who meets whom. So it's a tough environment for intelligence.""

But McLauglin adds that if you can't peer into Putin's mind, you still can analyze the realities he's grappling with, which may inform his actions.

""In the case of Russia, you would look at the effect of sanctions, which have been very heavy on them,"" McLaughlin says. ""The fact that the ruble is now at kind of an all-time low, the fact that they have a serious capital-flight problem.""

There's also the fact that Putin has spoken openly about his overarching goal of re-establishing Russia as a major world power. It's up to the CIA and other spy agencies to figure out how he plans next to go about it.",[]

Police in Allegheny County, Pa., say five people are dead after unidentified shooters attacked what appeared to be a backyard party in the borough of Wilkinsburg late Wednesday night.

Four people  three women and a man  died at the scene. A female victim died at the hospital. Two men are in critical condition and a woman is in stable condition.

Lt. Andrew Schurman of the county's homicide unit said in a statement, ""It would appear from early examination of the scene that a backyard party/cookout was being held at the rear of the home.

Schurman said shots were fired from an alley to the rear of the property, and that ""partygoers appeared to try to run into the residence at which point a person on the side or backyard adjacent to the residence fired at the back porch.""

""All four of the individuals who died at the scene died on that back porch,"" Schurman added.

Authorities believe at least two suspects fled on foot.

Names, addresses and phone numbers of some 22,000 ISIS recruits  and information about the network that recruited them  are reportedly part of a trove of data that Sky News says it received from a former member of the extremist group.

The identities of people from more than 50 countries, including Britain, European nations, the U.S. and Canada, are in the data, which Sky says it has shared with government authorities.

""Some of the telephone numbers on the list are still active,"" Sky reports, ""and it is believed that although many will be family members, a significant number are used by the jihadis themselves.""

It's not yet clear how many of the thousands of people named in the documents might have traveled to join ISIS, and how many may still be in their home countries.

Among the most intriguing elements of the data trove: 23-line recruitment forms that were filled out by sponsors that begin with recruits' ""name"" and ""fighter name"" and then include their mother's maiden name and their blood type. Education and job experience are also covered; so are combat experience and ""date and place of death""  implying that the paperwork was meant to follow the recruit once they've joined ISIS.

The forms also include the question, ""Who recommended him?""  which may help the authorities establish a crucial link between the terrorist organization and far-flung recruiters.

Some of the recruits listed in the files are Westerners who are known to have traveled to join ISIS, Sky reports, citing several cases of high-profile British recruits who have either been killed or whose whereabouts are unknown.

News of the massive data leak comes days after German media reported that they had obtained a similar set of documents. According to Deutsche Welle, a representative of Germany's federal police says they have the documents, and that they're authentic. It's unclear whether the sets of data are the same.

Citing Germany's interior ministry, NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin, ""The ministry says the files could also undermine the ability of ISIS to recruit and inspire new fighters.""

Soraya adds, ""It's not known how many ISIS fighters are in Syria and Iraq, but estimates range between 30,000 and 100,000.""

Today, Sky reports obtaining the data on a memory stick provided by a former member of the Free Syrian Army using the name Abu Hamed, who joined ISIS but then quit because he believes the group stopped following Islamic law and is too heavily influenced by former members from Iraq's Baath party.

""It's far from Islam,"" the man tells Sky News' Stuart Ramsay, during an interview in Turkey in which he wore a scarf to obscure his face.

When asked whether the information might be used to destroy ISIS, the man answers, ""God willing, if we give it to those who will use it, of course.""

Once the administrative forms were filled out, Ramsay reports, they were given to ISIS' head of internal security, who then put the data on a memory stick.

Ramsay also says that his contact also told him that ISIS is in the process of moving its headquarters from Raqqa, Syria, to the desert and then Iraq. He also claimed that in Syria, ISIS has collaborated with President Bashar al Assad's government and other groups to fight the country's moderate opposition forces.",[]

Hot blue lightning seems to crackle, Star-Wars-Emperor-style, across the surface of The Complete Wimmen's Comix. Its title is a cheeky riff on the renaming passion that consumed feminism in the early '70s, and its two volumes come in a (actually rather ugly) salmon-colored box decorated with examples of the series' highly inconsistent artwork. The whole bulky thing feels like a suitcase bomb packed with jagged hunks of social revolution. And that energy keeps sparking throughout the 704 pages of this frenetic, anarchic, occasionally kamikaze production.

It's hard to think of an aspect of women's lives, real or fantastical, that Wimmen's Comix doesn't touch on. In 1971's ""Breaking Out,"" a cabal of female comics characters  including Little Lulu, Betty and Veronica, and Petunia Pig  rise up against sexist double standards. (Betty and Veronica picket outside the high school, demanding classes in karate and women's history.) In Joyce Farmer's 1975 ""Equal Rites,"" a dozen naked witches hold a birthing ritual to summon their forbears' spirits from outer space. Cecelia Capuana's ""Modemorphose,"" from 1985, shows women's bodies changing to reflect the strangeness of female fashion: The figures grow huge bottoms, uni-bosoms or multiple legs that stick out in all directions.

Many of the artists fantasize about crime. In 1976's ""Petite Morte,"" Joey Epstein envisions an all-woman street gang called the Tenderettes that rolls men for drug money  until one gang member develops a strange and lethal passion for their marks. In Melinda Gebbie's 1976 ""The Confectionary,"" a sex-starved woman holds up a couple, kills the woman and rapes the man. Sharon Rudahl tells of a woman helping her son escape from a Mexican jail in ""Jailbreak at Hermosillo.""

Some artists simply turn a wry eye on the mundanities of life. In 1988, Mary Fleener recalls her friendship with a self-dramatizing ""Trauma Mama."" In Teresa Richards' 1976 ""Chapstick,"" a woman fantasizes a steamy, explicit tryst on an elevator, then settles down to watch ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.""

It's genuinely painful to imagine the radical, clashing perspectives that might have been found in these pages if the collective had only reached out to more women of color.

It may be hard to see how ""Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman"" and female-on-male rape can find homes in the same publication. But there's a strong, common current of energy unifying Wimmen's Comix. That's partly because some feminist issues, like abortion, are as fraught today as they were back in 1971. It's also because the collective seems to have remained mostly white, as far as can be judged from the photos in the introduction and the skin tone that predominates in the comics. It's genuinely painful to imagine the radical, clashing perspectives that might have been found in these pages if the collective had only reached out to more women of color.

They did reach out to a huge number of contributors  apparently regardless of artistic talent. The artwork is a total grab bag, ranging from the polished creations of Rudahl, Trina Robbins, Phoebe Gloeckner and Dot Bucher to painfully amateurish doodles by creators better left unnamed. Mixed in is subversive work in which wild, even ugly scrawls evoke an unnerving sense of chaos (Dori Seda, Diane Noomin and the perennially obstreperous Aline Kominsky-Crumb). There's even the occasional contribution from a soon-to-be-notable name (Lynda Barry, Alison Bechdel, Julie Doucet).

There's one more reason for the unity of spirit in Wimmen's Comix: These these artists, all clearly in agreement that ""the personal is political,"" are much more comfortable with the first half of that pairing. They do tackle equal pay for equal work in the publication's early years and AIDS in later ones, with a dizzying assortment of topics in between. Rape, prostitution, sexual harassment, vegetarian cooking, science fiction, gothic romances, socks, bondage, nuns, farting, motorcycles and magic all feature in these pages. There are feminist fairy tales, stories of Harriet Tubman and Julia Pastrana, the Ugliest Woman in the World, a board game, and a pointillist study of a cervix. There's even a 3-D issue (glasses included).

Still, though, these comics largely stick to the personal, to relationships and fantasies and the absurdities of everyday life. Whether it's 1971 or 1989, the contributors' favorite topics are self-definition and men, men, men. (Not to mention sex, sex, sex. Everyone is doing it in these pages, including cats and bugs.)

This says something about the nature of women and the nature of comics. It may be that, however revolutionary women's goals are, our first impulse is always to change ourselves before we take on the world at large. And it seems that no matter how talented the artist, it's just really hard to be funny about equal pay for equal work.

You might call it old wine in new bottles, but what sweet, masterfully crafted wine it is. Upheld by Stillness, the debut album by the young and vibrant British a cappella choir ORA, presents a contemporary twist on a 16th-century classic.

The group, founded in 2014 by Artistic Director Suzi Digby, asked a handful of today's choral composers to create a musical response to William Byrd's Mass for Five Voices, an intricate, richly scored polyphonic work popular with choirs around the world. Each composer took inspiration from one of the five movements of the Mass, while Byrd's original (written around 1595) forms the centerpiece of the album.

Roxanna Panufnik (daughter of the late Polish composer Andrzej Panufnik) chose Byrd's Kyrie, the traditional mass opener which pleads for God's mercy (""Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison"").

Beginning and ending in hushed reverence, Panufnik's version slowly blooms in contemporary harmonies. Voices interweave in dusky colors, pierced by strands of white light from the upper ranges of ORA's beautifully blended sopranos. Two minutes in, the piece pauses on a lovely drone from the basses, before the vocal engine chugs back up to speed  ominous and inevitable.

American intelligence officers are trained to tackle tough targets.

But there are tough targets, and then there's Russian President Vladimir Putin, who plays his cards so closely that it's hard for his own advisers to divine what he's thinking, says Gregory Treverton, chairman of the National Intelligence Council.

""Putin is so isolated that the chances that he might miscalculate and do something rash are top of my list for things I worry about,"" says Treverton. ""I am fond of distinguishing between puzzles  those things that have an answer, though we may not know it  and mysteries, those things that are iffy and contingent. And so how Putin is going to behave is presumably a mystery, and probably even a mystery to Putin.""

Treverton is not alone in this view.

Retired Adm. James Stavridis, commander of NATO forces from 2009 to 2013, says Putin is exceptional in how little he telegraphs.

""He certainly has a cabinet of close advisers,"" Stavridis says.""But at the end of the day, the strategic terrain is not on a map somewhere  it's in between Vladimir Putin's ears.""

That makes it hard for the CIA and other spy agencies charged with tracking Russian military and economic assets  and with anticipating what Moscow might do next on the conflict in Syria, tensions in Crimea and a wide range of other matters.

Stavridis, now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, points to a couple of factors that make Putin such a difficult target.

One is the degree of control he has amassed in his 17 years as either prime minister or president of Russia. You have to look to North Korea, Stavridis says, or to Fidel Castro's long reign in Cuba to find another ruler who wields such absolute power.

The tools of espionage  phone intercepts, satellite imagery and more  can sometimes overcome such disadvantages, but may be of limited use against Putin: He's a trained spy himself.

Vladimir Putin joined the KGB in 1975, and was sent to Dresden in East Germany in order to spy on the West during the Cold War. There he learned both near-flawless German and near-flawless spycraft.

""Russia has always had a very strong counterintelligence capability, and Putin would be well-schooled in this,"" says John McLaughlin, who served as acting director of the CIA in 2004, during Putin's first stint as president. McLaughlin says the aides in whom Putin might confide are mostly ex-KGB, too. ""The inner circle there would be very conscious of how they communicate, conscious of who meets whom. So it's a tough environment for intelligence.""

But McLauglin adds that if you can't peer into Putin's mind, you still can analyze the realities he's grappling with, which may inform his actions.

""In the case of Russia, you would look at the effect of sanctions, which have been very heavy on them,"" McLaughlin says. ""The fact that the ruble is now at kind of an all-time low, the fact that they have a serious capital-flight problem.""

There's also the fact that Putin has spoken openly about his overarching goal of re-establishing Russia as a major world power. It's up to the CIA and other spy agencies to figure out how he plans next to go about it.",[]

PWR BTTM is a loud, lovable duo from New York with its high-heels planted firmly in The Ramones school of rock. Ben Hopkins and Liv Bruce trade off singing, drumming and guitar  sometimes within a single song. Both Ben and Liv wrote to tell me their thoughts on the song and though their comments aren't in conflict, each one's relationship to the song feels a little different. Liv said, ""What if you threw a party and no one came? What if your friends were all at the beach and you were at the DMV? What if your crush never texted back? Maybe all you can do is focus on what you like about yourself and try to have a good time alone. This video is about taking authorship of your life, even if you can't fully control which characters stick around.""

The video was shot in an abandoned waterpark in the Mojave Desert, which connects to Ben's thought on the song, that it's about exploring nostalgia and ""unpacking how even something as complicated as a relationship between two people can be boiled down to one place or memory, so setting those feelings at a place that's frozen in the past felt like a logical fit. Plus, it was colorful.""

Director H.S. Naji ties all these ideas together. ""I planned for the term 'revisiting desolation' to be the crux of the video,"" he wrote to me. ""The location plays as all those broken promises, false hopes and crushed hearts everyone experiences. We see these two personas walk through that familiar cemetery of attractions  and at least make do with pool paraphernalia and glitter.""

The video ends with a faux film rating  Q for Queer  and a note that it may cause hot flashes and boy sweats. Consider yourself warned.

i toggle caption AP AP

Names, addresses and phone numbers of some 22,000 ISIS recruits  and information about the network that recruited them  are reportedly part of a trove of data that Sky News says it received from a former member of the extremist group.

The identities of people from more than 50 countries, including Britain, European nations, the U.S. and Canada, are purportedly in the data, which Sky says it has shared with government authorities.

""Some of the telephone numbers on the list are still active,"" Sky reports, ""and it is believed that although many will be family members, a significant number are used by the jihadis themselves.""

It's not yet clear how many of the thousands of people named in the documents might have traveled to join ISIS, and how many may still be in their home countries.

Among the most intriguing elements said to be in the data trove: 23-line recruitment forms filled out by sponsors that begin with recruits' ""name"" and ""fighter name"" and then include their mother's maiden name and their blood type. Education and job experience are also covered; so are combat experience and ""date and place of death""  implying that the paperwork was meant to follow the recruit once they've joined ISIS.

The forms also reportedly include the question, ""Who recommended him?""  which may help the authorities establish a crucial link between the terrorist organization and far-flung recruiters.

Some of the recruits listed in the files are Westerners who are known to have traveled to join ISIS, Sky reports, citing several cases of high-profile British recruits who have either been killed or whose whereabouts are unknown.

The news comes days after German media outlets reported having obtained a similar set of documents. According to Deutsche Welle, a representative of Germany's federal police says they have the documents and that they're authentic. It's unclear whether the sets of data are the same.

NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin that Germany's Interior Ministry ""says the files could also undermine the ability of ISIS to recruit and inspire new fighters.""

""It's not known how many ISIS fighters are in Syria and Iraq, but estimates range between 30,000 and 100,000,"" Soraya adds.

Sky News said it obtained the data via a memory stick provided by a former member of the Free Syrian Army using the name Abu Hamed, who joined ISIS but then quit because he believes the group stopped following Islamic law and is too heavily influenced by former members of Iraq's Baath party.

""It's far from Islam,"" the man tells Sky News' Stuart Ramsay, during an interview in Turkey in which he wore a scarf to obscure his face.

When asked whether the information might be used to destroy ISIS, the man answers, ""God willing, if we give it to those who will use it, of course.""

Once the administrative forms were filled out, Ramsay reports, they were given to ISIS' head of internal security, who then put the data on the memory stick.

Ramsay also says his contact told him that ISIS is in the process of moving its headquarters from Raqqa, Syria, to the desert and then to Iraq. He also claimed that in Syria, ISIS has collaborated with President Bashar Assad's government and other groups to fight the country's moderate opposition forces.",[]

i via YouTube via YouTube

Eric O'Grey knew he was in trouble. His weight had ballooned to 340 pounds, and he was spending more than $1,000 a month on medications for high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.

In 2010, a physician told him to buy a funeral plot, because he would need it in five years. He was 51 years old.

So he went to talk with naturopathic doctor about losing weight. She said: Get a shelter dog.

O'Grey was surprised, but he took that advice, heading to the Humane Society Silicon Valley near his home in San Jose, Calif. He told the shelter, ""I want an obese middle-aged dog, like me."" That's how he met Peety.

Peety needed to be walked, so Eric and Peety walked, for at least a half an hour a day. O'Grey, who was working as an area sales manager for GE appliances, started a plant-based diet. Over the course of a year, he lost 140 pounds. Peety lost 25. O'Grey got off the meds.

It wasn't just the walks with Peety that transformed O'Grey's life. The dog helped him from backsliding into his old unhealthful ways. ""He looked at me like I was the best person on the planet, and I wanted to become the person he thought I was.""

Their story might have ended there. But Carol Novello, president of the Humane Society Silicon Valley, had been trying to make the point that helping animals improves the lives of humans, too. She was finding that a tough sell, so she started looking for stories that made the case. ""A while ago Eric O'Grey submitted his story, and I just loved it.""

Novello, a former tech executive, asked David Whitman, executive producer of the Tech Awards of Silicon Valley, what they could do with Eric and Peety's story. He came up with the idea of the Mutual Rescue initiative, which includes a contest where people can share stories of how a shelter animal changed their lives. The winning tale gets a video made about their rescue story. Donors to the HSSV funded production of the Eric and Peety video as an example.

""It's really about the transformation and the impact that animals can have on our lives,"" Novello says.

YouTube

Since the contest opened in February the HSSV has received hundreds of stories, many of which focus on on health. ""We may do a Mutual Rescue weight loss series,"" Novello says. ""There are a lot of them.""

Sure, stories are nice, but do pets really improve human health? No less an authority than the Centers for Disease and Prevention says yes. Having a pet can help decrease blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and feelings of loneliness, the CDC says, while increasing opportunities for exercise and socializing with other humans. And there's increasing evidence that interaction with pets helps people cope with challenges including PTSD, Alzheimer's and end of life.

I know our shelter kitties make my family happier, even though they haven't help me lose weight. And watching the Eric and Peety video has to be good for my heart, though it makes me reach for the tissues every time.

""He transformed me into a completely different person,"" O'Grey says in the video. ""I think about it now; who rescued whom? Did I rescue him, or did he rescue me?""",[]

A new study confirms what many Americans already knew deep in their hearts: We're not good at math.

Not only that, when it comes to technology skills we're dead last compared with other developed countries.

The PIAAC study  the Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies  looks at the skills adults need to do everyday tasks, whether it's at work or in their social lives.

""Clearly, we have some work to do in this country,"" says Peggy Carr, the acting commissioner of the government's National Center for Education Statistics. The study compared countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Japan and Finland led the group in literacy, math and technology skills, while the United States' performance was average or well below average in each category.

Literacy

Overall, Americans' everyday literacy skills were average. But if you zoom in and focus on just the young adults, a more complex picture emerges.

Americans who went to college and graduate school did well. They scored above their peers with similar degrees in other developed countries.

For young adults with a high school diploma or less, things did not look so good. These Americans performed significantly worse than those in other countries with the same education level.

""Post-secondary institutions should be happy,"" says Carr. ""But on the other end of the continuum, we have young people coming out of high school  or not graduating from high school  that are struggling with everyday competencies.""

Math

Carr says this pattern is even more obvious if you look at the math skills of young adults. This study found that Americans with a high school diploma performed about the same as high school dropouts in other countries.

""We need to think seriously about how to get them functioning better,"" says Carr.

She offers a sample math problem from the test: You go to the store and there's a sale. Buy one, get the second half off. So if you buy two, how much do you pay?

""High school credentialed adults, they can't do this task  on average,"" says Carr.

Technology

When it comes to technology skills, the story gets worse. The U.S. came in last place  right below Poland.

The study looked at basic technology tasks: things like using email, buying and returning items online, using a drop-down menu, naming a file on a computer or sending a text message.

Across the board, Americans performed poorly on these tasks. However, there was a significant racial difference with non-whites scoring below whites.

""I don't think we were particularly shocked by that finding,"" says Carr. She points out that these racial differences are similar to what other national and international studies have found.

She says these findings should be concerning to everyone, especially leaders in the business community and in the K-12 school systems.",[]

A curious crowd lingered around Amal Graafstra as he carefully unpacked a pair of gloves, a small sterile blanket and a huge needle. A long line of people were waiting to get tiny computer chips implanted into their hands.

Graafstra had set up shop in a booth in the middle of an exhibit hall at the Austin Convention Center, where he gathered last month with several hundred others who call themselves ""body hackers""  people who push the boundaries of implantable technology to improve the human body.

The movement evokes visceral reactions, brings up safety and ethical concerns and quickly veers into sci-fi questions about the line between human and cyborg.

Graafstra is a pioneer in the space. Using his own body to experiment, he designed bio-safe magnets and the microchip he was about to implant into the hand of A.J. Butt, who was sporting a tall, blue mohawk.

toggle caption Eyder Peralta/NPR

The implantable RFID chips hold encrypted information, and their unique ID numbers can be used to open doors or unlock the owner's smartphone, which is what Butt wants to do.

Butt took a deep breath. The needle plunged into his skin at the base of his thumb, and a chip bigger than a grain of rice slipped just below the surface.

Across the way, Sasha Rose, who was working a meditation booth at the convention, watched the people line up to be ""chipped.""

She shook her head: This was the craziest thing she had seen. She wondered about Graafstra's credentials. She thought this was a medical procedure, so should he be performing it? Did his clients know the potential consequences of carrying personal information on a device inside their skin?

""More than the crazy concept, it's actually people's willingness to accept it. That's why it's crazy to me,"" Rose said. ""People are just willing to just line up and go, 'Yeah, stick that in me.' ""

At night, many of the convention goers gathered at a club on Austin's 6th Street.

Graafstra was outside with Ryan O'Shea, whose company Grindhouse Wetware made the Internet squirm earlier this year when it released a close-up surgery video of one of its implants called Northstar. In it, a man gets a small incision in his hand and then, with a metallic tool dipped into it, the skin is lifted to produce a cavity where a round subdermal implant with five LED lights is placed.

The result looks dystopian  the incision is stitched with black thread, and LED lights make the skin on the hand glow red.

But body hackers view the world differently, Graafstra said. They believe technology has reached a point where it can improve the human body instead of just fixing what's broken.

toggle caption Eyder Peralta/NPR

""A patient may someday come very soon and say, 'My eye is totally fine, but I want an eye that can see infrared. And I want an eye that can zoom,' "" Graafstra said.

That kind of future  where the human body is augmented by technology  is the goal of many of these experiments.

O'Shea said Grindhouse Wetware is using its LED device to test how long a device like it can remain charged inside a body, and Graafstra said his RFID chip is a small attempt at merging digital identity with physical identity.

""I think once people realize, 'Oh, it's OK that my grandma has a pacemaker' ... people are going to start to accept this,"" O'Shea said. ""You know, the era of transhumanism, I would say, is here. So let's accept that and then see where that logically takes us.""

Inside the club, a drone hovered above the dance floor. The polished steel and the electronic dance music gave it a futuristic feel.

Standing near the bar was Tony Salvador, who studies social values and how they affect technology at Intel. He was at the conference to get a feel of when and if ""body hacking"" may be accepted into the mainstream.

If we define ourselves as organisms, suddenly our group is wider.

Sometimes, he said, technology moves too fast and outpaces accepted social boundaries  not to mention laws. He argued that was part of the reason why early wearers of Google Glass were called ""glassholes.""

""It created a social misunderstanding,"" Salvador said. ""You didn't know what was going on.""

To Salvador, the boundaries of acceptance are a matter of our social philosophy, an area that he argued was driven by esoteric discourse without tangible moral and ethical recommendations.

The philosophers, he said, are letting us down.

Alva Noe, a philosopher at the University of California, Berkeley, and contributor to NPR's 13.7: Cosmos and Culture blog, has written extensively on what he calls ""cyborgian naturalness."" He disagreed that the modern philosophers dropped the ball, saying that tackling the matter would involve unpacking two questions:

Is it OK to cut into human bodies for these kinds of experiments? How much tolerance should society have for artificially enhancing the body?

To the first question, Noe said he found the ""body hacking"" experimentation on humans ""ethically disturbing"" and couldn't fathom a doctor or any other scientists conducting these kinds of operations.

The second question was more complicated.

""We don't condemn people for using glasses to see better,"" he said. ""But we do start to think taking speed to cope with your work life is questionable.""

Because those kinds of judgments are an ethical question, drawing a tolerance line may always be a moving target, he said.

""We may reach consensuses and then lose them,"" Noe said. ""Just as there was once a consensus where it was OK to smoke to function effectively, and now we have the consensus that, increasingly, it's not OK to do that.""

If there's a rock star in the body hacking movement, that's Neil Harbisson, a colorblind artist from Barcelona, who persuaded a doctor to implant a camera in the back of his head. The antenna, as he calls it, essentially lets Harbisson listen to colors by detecting the dominant color in front of him and translating it into musical notes.

toggle caption Luis Ortiz/LatinContent/Getty Images

The way he tells it, a medical ethics committee in Europe had refused to sign off on the operation but a doctor agreed to perform the surgery anonymously. From it, Harbisson emerged with a camera connected to a device on the back of his skull, its lens dangling in front of his face on a rod that arcs over his head.

As he walked the streets of Austin, he described how he perceived the world: the red traffic light sounded like an A note, the green grass sounded like an F.

In his keynote address at the conference, Harbisson said the first time he heard those colors in his sleep, he felt truly cyborg. Now, he no longer identifies as human, but a ""cybernetic organism.""

""If we define ourselves as organisms, suddenly our group is wider,"" he said. ""We are on the same level as an insect, or as a cat, or as a plant.""

Harbisson is well aware of how the world perceives him. He moved from Barcelona to New York City in search of ""peace"" with another friend in the transhumanist movement, Moon Ribas. Ribas has an electronic device in her arm that she said vibrates when there is an earthquake anywhere in the world.

On more than one occasion, people have tried to rip off his antenna, Harbisson said. That's part of the reason why he co-founded the Cyborg Foundation to advocate for ""cyborg rights.""

When asked if he's ever thought about just taking the antenna off, Harbisson demurred.

""To me, it's much stronger, the wish to sense what's around me than the fact that people keep annoying me,"" he said, adding that maybe, in the future, as others get new senses, he'll be considered normal.",[]

China's economy isn't doing too well these days, but you wouldn't know it from the government's real estate transaction center in Shanghai's Baoshan district. Hundreds of people jam the office every day to put in paperwork for homes they've just purchased. The crowds are so loud and anxious that guards wearing white hardhats and wielding bullhorns patrol the lines to keep order.

In January, home prices in Shanghai were up by more than 15 percent from a year earlier, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. In the southern city of Shenzhen, prices have jumped by more than 50 percent in the past 12 months.

i toggle caption Frank Langfitt/NPR Frank Langfitt/NPR

""Originally, I didn't plan to buy at this particular time, but now prices have forced me to,"" says a construction worker surnamed Zhang, 50, speaking over the din of the crowd at the transaction center. ""If I don't buy now, future prices will be more unbearable.""

Sitting next to him is Anna Zhang, no relation, who feels the same way. Zhang, who is 27 and works for an export company, has just bought her first home with her husband. The apartment, which is less than 600 square feet, cost the couple more than $200,000, most of which they borrowed from a bank. That's a lot of money in a city where the average annual salary is about $14,000, according to Zhaopin.com, a job recruitment portal.

Anna Zhang says she had no intention of spending so much, but had no choice.

""I would call a homeowner in the morning and he'd offer one price,"" she says. ""When I called him back in the afternoon, there was another price. This happened twice and [the] price jumped anywhere from $7,500 to $15,000.""

Home prices are rising in top-tier cities, including Beijing and Guangzhou, at a time when China's economic growth continues to slow and currency and stock prices remain down. GDP growth was 6.9 percent last year, the lowest rate in a quarter-century. The Shanghai composite has dropped by about 45 percent since its high in June.

What gives? Oliver Rui, who teaches finance at China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, says rising home prices are not a sign of confidence in the economy  but of uncertainty. Many small and mid-size business owners are pouring money into Shanghai real estate because they see it as a safe haven for their capital.

""They think that the outlook of the economy is not clear,"" says Rui. ""They don't want to further invest in their business, so the best way to hedge against inflation is real estate.""

That's because, historically, real estate in top Chinese cities has been a sure bet. If you bought an apartment in downtown Shanghai in, say, the year 2000, you might have seen the value rise 10 times.

Rui, though, warns that continuing to pour money into China's real estate sector isn't good for the economy in the long run. It sidelines capital that could be better used to build a more nimble, innovative economic model that could create better jobs with higher wages.

While China's wealthiest cities are enjoying price runs, huge swaths of apartments in so-called second-, third- and fourth-tier cities in the country's interior are gathering dust. At the end of last year, there were about 182 square miles worth of unsold residential floor space, according to the Chinese government. That's more than the area of Philadelphia.

China's government has cut deed taxes and reduced down payment requirements to try to sell off some of this white-elephant inventory  but many Chinese have neither the cash nor the desire to buy in smaller cities.

""There's a concern that in the future, there will be fewer and fewer policy measures available to get people to buy this housing,"" said Lu Wenxi, a researcher with Centaline, a leading real estate company operating in China. ""If the market weakens further, we'll eventually use up all the tools in our toolbox.""

Officials in the northeastern rust-belt city of Shenyang recently considered offering college graduates housing loans with no down payment. In a culture known for thrift, this sort of sub-prime scheme drew howls online, and the local government put plans on hold.

""That indicates in certain areas,"" says Rui, ""the local government is desperate.""",[]

It was a veiled reference to Donald Trump's private parts. Wright nixed the debate, telling her disappointed son the candidates ""weren't acting like adults.""

As parents like Wright are tuning in to this year's presidential campaign  and the mudslinging, racial comments and sexual innuendo that come with it  they are struggling with how much to show their kids, and how to explain it all.

If you've missed the debates, here's a taste (courtesy of All Things Considered):

Though indecent language seems to have reached a fever pitch on the Republican side, the Democrats have had their share of shouting and interrupting too.

""They should have ratings at the front of the debates,"" Wright laughs. ""You know, 'Contains language, and violence, and sexual content.' That might be helpful for parents.""

For the next debate, Wright says she might pre-screen, so she can fast forward through any inappropriate parts. When she does let her four children watch, Wright tries to find lessons where she can.

""We say, 'Hey, look how he's mean or bullying to this person. That's not how you talk to someone.' Or, 'See how he doesn't really answer the person's question, he just picks on him instead? That's not how you debate.""

Her 10-year-old son Houston isn't sure whether he should be surprised by the language in these debates.

""It's hard to say,"" he says. ""I knew there would be a lot of yelling and shouting. I guess I'm kind of used to it now.""

In Louisville, Ky., Laura Hall's 13-year-old son takes part in mock government at school, and is also paying close attention to the campaign. Normally she would welcome this real-time civics education, but this year she's not so sure.

""In a way it makes me sad that, at this pivotal point in his development, this is what he's seeing,"" Hall says. ""To see some of the candidates moving ahead and gaining support through bad behavior and hateful speech.""

She's a Democrat, but wants to teach her son respect for all candidates. The seventh grader will be old enough to vote in the next presidential election, and she wonders if this season will affect his long term view of the parties.

Hall felt the need for a teachable moment last week, after a Trump rally in Louisville. A video that got a lot of local coverage, and went viral online, shows an older white man helping to expel an African-American woman who was protesting.

""Pushing her and shoving her, and they were screaming at her,"" Hall says, ""and it was really horrible to see. It's important that the kids understand that that happens, and it's not acceptable.""

Hall's son Benjamin has noticed the crowds at debates as well.

""The people are kind of egging them on,"" he says. ""Because I've seen clips where they'll say something rude to one another, and you'll hear everybody cheer and laugh. And that's not a good example for bystanding.""

At Sherwood Githens Middle School in Durham, N.C., eighth grader Samori Reed-Bandele follows the campaign on social media. He says all the candidates' name-calling doesn't seem very presidential.

""I just feel as though it's real childish,"" he says, ""and I don't think grown adults should be acting like us.""

He and some classmates say they're studying the campaign in school, writing papers on heated topics that have come up, like immigration. Eighth grader Michelle Terron Azamar's parents are from Mexico. She says her family felt hurt when Trump compared Mexican immigrants to rapists and criminals.

""I've been really offended,"" she said. ""That's his opinion if he wants to not like Hispanics, or whatever he doesn't like. But I just think he shouldn't take it out on us.""

Terron Azamar said her dad, who has not discussed politics with her much in the past, has been talking to her a lot about this year's campaign, and telling her that Trump will not win in a general election.

Others parents say they're more worried about how children are hearing and relaying Trump's discussion of mass deportation and building a border wall.

""Last week, my kindergartner son told me that a class friend of his expressed to him with tears in her eyes, 'If Trump becomes president, we'll have to move. He doesn't like our family,'"" says Brent Seavers of Northern California, in a Facebook posting. ""That, to me, is a bigger concern than the name-calling. That is doing real psychological damage to innocent children.""

Alejandra Abella, who teaches middle school debate in Ventura County, Calif., said she's using the debates as an example  but not usually a good one. ""Unfortunately, I have been able to pull more examples of what should not be done in debating than examples of what should be done,"" she said.

At first, when Abella showed the class video clips from Republican debates, she was horrified. She teaches Lincoln-Douglas style, in which debaters base their arguments on ethical values.

""Honestly, these moments in the debates in which they're hearing lots of words and absolutely no substance, are helping them understand, 'Why do we look for value in Lincoln Douglas debates?'"" she said, ""And it's helping them focus on that.""

She sees it as a silver lining, show kids they can learn from even a negative example.",[]

i toggle caption Geoff Robbins/AFP/Getty Images Geoff Robbins/AFP/Getty Images

The remaining four Republican candidates debate once again tonight in Miami. Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich will be on the stage together for the last time before next Tuesday's big primary night when voters in Ohio and Florida  Rubio and Kasich's home states  go to the polls. Tuesday is a make or break night for the two of them and tonight's debate is the last chance they have to change the dynamic in a race that has not been going their way.

Here are four things to watch  one for each candidate.

1. How will Trump behave?

Lately the front runner has been trying to appear more ""presidential,"" holding press conferences instead of rallies after his primary wins to project more gravitas. In the last debate, he announced that he was flexible and would change his positions if necessary in order to break the gridlock in Washington. But that was just minutes before  and after  he talked about the size of his hands and a certain part of his anatomy. So we're not sure which Trump will show up tonight  the one who calls his opponents stupid, fat, losers, or the one who promised on Tuesday night: ""I can be more presidential than anybody other than the great Abe Lincoln. He was very presidential, right?""

2. Does Cruz punch up or down?

Cruz is in the number two spot  only about 100 delegates behind Donald Trump. He has the strongest case to make that if the nominee is not going to be Trump, it should be him. Some establishment Republicans in the #nevertrump movement are coming around to the idea that as much as they dislike Cruz he might be their only choice. Lindsay Graham, no fan of Cruz's, says it may be time to rally around the Texas senator. Still, Cruz has a total of ZERO endorsements from his fellow senators.

Tonight, does Cruz use his formidable debating skills to try again, to cut Trump down to size, or does he attack Rubio and Kasich, whose continued presence in the race prevent him from consolidating the anti-Trump vote?

3. Rubio on the ropes

Now that Jeb Bush has left the race, Rubio has become Trump's preferred punching bag. Rubio tried undermining Trump with insults but that didn't work. Trump needled him about this on Tuesday night, helpfully pointing out that, ""hostility works for some people . It doesn't work for everybody, O.K.? ""

Rubio has the most to lose next week. If he doesn't win his home state of Florida, he will not only give up any shred of viability as a candidate, he could also hurt his political career going forward. Unlike Cruz and Kasich, who have day jobs they can keep, Rubio gave up his Senate seat to run for president and is not running for reelection in the fall.

4. Kasich needs to win something

Kasich has an even worse record in this primary than Rubio, who won in Minnesota and Puerto Rico. Kasich hasn't won anywhere. Tuesday was a disappointment for Kasich. He came in third in Michigan, which is a rust belt state like his own Ohio. Kasich once had hopes of winning there or placing a strong second.

Trump is beating him in the polls in Ohio and Kasich has said that if he doesn't win his home state he's done. So, tonight, what does Kasich do to claw his way back into contention? Does he continue his ""Mr. Nice Guy"" strategy, showing voters that he's a reasonable, not very partisan, not very angry candidate who is as fed up with the antics of his opponents as they are? Or does he actually try to take on Trump?

Granted, that hasn't worked for anyone else but there's not much time left.",[]

Pope Francis is cracking down on the money machine that powers the sainthood process, months after two Italian journalists published books alleging jaw-dropping financial mismanagement at the Vatican.

Those working on the process of canonization and beatification will now have to provide regular accounting of where money is being spent, and a new fund will be opened to provide resources for cash-strapped sainthood campaigns.

The steep cost of saint-making, and the lack of oversight and transparency that surround the process, were two of the immediately controversial revelations in Emanuele Fittipaldi's Avarice and, especially, Gianluigi Nuzzi's Merchants in the Temple. Both books were published in November.

In his book, which draws heavily on anonymous sources and allegedly leaked documents, Nuzzi estimates that the cost of sainthood at the Vatican regularly ran about half a million euros  more than half a million dollars.

The fact that beatification and canonization would be expensive isn't, by itself, astonishing. Catholic sainthood is a lengthy process, involving years of research and reams of paper to document and analyze the would-be saint's life, beliefs and reported miracles. (As an example of the scale involved: Remember Junipero Serra, who was canonized last year? The process of granting him sainthood began in the 1940s and involved accumulating approximately 10,000 pages of source material and writing a 1,200-page positio, or position paper, explaining the justification for his canonization.)

But Nuzzi alleged that the process was both unfair and shockingly unsupervised. The Catholic Herald says wealthy donors could essentially bankroll their selected candidate for sainthood, while potential saints who didn't have deep-pocketed supporters would not have the funds for the necessary research.

Leftover money from well-supported sainthood campaigns was supposed to go into a fund to help poorer candidates, but somehow it seemed there was never any spare cash, no matter how flush a sainthood ""cause"" was, Nuzzi writes.

Where did that money go? It wasn't clear, Nuzzi said, writing that many postulators  the people who spearhead the canonization of a given candidate for sainthood  weren't keeping track of how the money was spent. No budgets, no expense reports, no financial statements.

Nuzzi's book depicts Francis as a determined reformer, fighting to transform a ""saint's factory"" that resists his attempts at oversight. In fact, the journalist describes a shocked Vatican freezing the bank accounts of offending postulators once they discovered the sheer amount of money being spent without any bookkeeping.

After he and Fittipaldi (who wrote extensively about misdirected donations) published their books, Pope Francis assigned a fact-finding commission to investigate how the Vatican spent money, The Associated Press reports.

That internal investigation led to the new financial rules.

Now, postulators will be required to document how they spend money  and set budgets for their projects. Their bank accounts will be subject to oversight.

There will be ""disciplinary procedures in case of misuse,"" Vatican Radio reports, and a process for liquidating funds once a saint is canonized or the campaign is dropped.

And a new ""solidarity fund,"" with set processes for adding and distributing money, will be established to help the causes of sainthood candidates who lack wealthy supporters.",[]

i Daniel Haskett/Corbis Daniel Haskett/Corbis

A new study confirms what many Americans already knew deep in their hearts: We're not good at math.

Not only that, when it comes to technology skills we're dead last compared with other developed countries.

The PIAAC study  the Program for International Assessment of Adult Competencies  looks at the skills adults need to do everyday tasks, whether it's at work or in their social lives.

""Clearly, we have some work to do in this country,"" says Peggy Carr, the acting commissioner of the government's National Center for Education Statistics. The study compared countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

Japan and Finland led the group in literacy, math and technology skills, while the United States' performance was average or well below average in each category.

Literacy

Overall, Americans' everyday literacy skills were average. But if you zoom in and focus on just the young adults, a more complex picture emerges.

Americans who went to college and graduate school did well. They scored above their peers with similar degrees in other developed countries.

For young adults with a high school diploma or less, things did not look so good. These Americans performed significantly worse than those in other countries with the same education level.

""Post-secondary institutions should be happy,"" says Carr. ""But on the other end of the continuum, we have young people coming out of high school  or not graduating from high school  that are struggling with everyday competencies.""

Math

Carr says this pattern is even more obvious if you look at the math skills of young adults. This study found that Americans with a high school diploma performed about the same as high school dropouts in other countries.

""We need to think seriously about how to get them functioning better,"" says Carr.

She offers a sample math problem from the test: You go to the store and there's a sale. Buy one, get the second half off. So if you buy two, how much do you pay?

""High school credentialed adults, they can't do this task  on average,"" says Carr.

Technology

When it comes to technology skills, the story gets worse. The U.S. came in last place  right below Poland.

The study looked at basic technology tasks: things like using email, buying and returning items online, using a drop-down menu, naming a file on a computer or sending a text message.

Across the board, Americans performed poorly on these tasks. However, there was a significant racial difference with non-whites scoring below whites.

""I don't think we were particularly shocked by that finding,"" says Carr. She points out that these racial differences are similar to what other national and international studies have found.

She says these findings should be concerning to everyone, especially leaders in the business community and in the K-12 school systems.",[]

i via YouTube via YouTube

Eric O'Grey knew he was in trouble. His weight had ballooned to 320 pounds, and he was spending more than $1,000 a month on medications for high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol.

In 2010, a physician told him to buy a funeral plot, because he would need it in five years. He was 51 years old.

So he went to talk with naturopathic doctor about losing weight. She said: Get a shelter dog.

O'Grey was surprised, but he took that advice, heading to the Humane Society Silicon Valley near his home in San Jose, Calif. He told the shelter, ""I want an obese middle-aged dog, like me."" That's how he met Peety.

Peety needed to be walked, so Eric and Peety walked, for at least a half an hour a day. O'Grey, who was working as an area sales manager for GE appliances, shifted to a plant-based diet. Over the course of a year, he lost 140 pounds. Peety lost 25. O'Grey got off the meds.

It wasn't just the walks with Peety that transformed O'Grey's life. The dog helped keep him from backsliding into his old unhealthful ways. ""He looked at me like I was the best person on the planet, and I wanted to become the person he thought I was.""

Their story might have ended there. But Carol Novello, president of the Humane Society Silicon Valley, had been trying to make the point that helping animals improves the lives of humans, too. She was finding that a tough sell, so she started looking for stories that made the case. ""A while ago Eric O'Grey submitted his story, and I just loved it.""

Novello, a former tech executive, asked David Whitman, executive producer of the Tech Awards of Silicon Valley, what they could do with Eric and Peety's story. He came up with the idea of the Mutual Rescue initiative, which includes a contest where people can share stories of how a shelter animal changed their lives. The winning tale gets a video made about their rescue story. Donors to the HSSV funded production of the Eric and Peety video as an example.

""It's really about the transformation and the impact that animals can have on our lives,"" Novello says.

YouTube

Since the contest opened in February the HSSV has received hundreds of stories, many of which focus on health. ""We may do a Mutual Rescue weight loss series,"" Novello says. ""There are a lot of them.""

Sure, stories are nice, but do pets really improve human health? No less an authority than the Centers for Disease and Prevention says yes. Having a pet can help decrease blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides and feelings of loneliness, the CDC says, while increasing opportunities for exercise and socializing with other humans. And there's increasing evidence that interaction with pets helps people cope with challenges including PTSD, Alzheimer's and the end of life.

I know our shelter kitties make my family happier, even though they haven't help me lose weight. And watching the Eric and Peety video has to be good for my heart, though it makes me reach for the tissues every time.

""He transformed me into a completely different person,"" O'Grey says in the video. ""I think about it now; who rescued whom? Did I rescue him, or did he rescue me?""",[]

YouTube

Carolina Chelele is a contestant on a popular reality TV show. But it's not about dating, housewives or survival. It's about ... farming. Specifically farming by females.



She and her competitors have each been given a bag of mortar and a single seed. The cameras are rolling. Thousands of dollars in prizes are on the line. The producers ask them: How do you plant it?

Ready? Set? Go!

Some farmers planted the seed directly in the mortar (in case you're not sure what mortar is, it's a mix of sand and cement). Others mixed the mortar with soil or mud. But Chelele, 49, sat back. She didn't touch the stuff.

""This challenge is impossible,"" she said.

She was correct, of course  you can't plant a seed in mortar. Water would just make it harden and set around the seed, which would have no room to grow.

Chelele's agricultural smarts (and common sense) helped her beat 14 other women farmers and win season 5 of Tanzanian's Female Food Heroes last August.

The show, sponsored by the international charity Oxfam, was created to show Africans just how valuable hard-working, experienced women farmers like Chelele are  even though they're not reaching their full potential.

Women make up 53 percent of Tanzania's small crop producers, but produce, on average, 14 percent fewer crops per acre than plots managed by men  which means they earn less money. This is because they lack access to credit, labor and fertilizer, factors essential to productivity, according to a report from the One Campaign and the World Bank.

Despite the serious subtext, Female Food Heroes takes a lighthearted approach. The farmers compete in all kinds of tasks over a 21-day period: selling goods on the side of the road, repairing mud walls and vaccinating goats. Viewers help determine the winner by voting for their favorite contestants.

Since the TV version of the program, Mama Shujaa wa Chakula, began airing in Tanzania in 2011, the show, in partnership with East Africa TV, has reached about 37 million viewers throughout the region, says Oxfam. And each season, nearly 3,000 female farmers vie for one of the 18 to 20 spots on the TV show.

The idea for the initiative came about after campaigners at a regional Oxfam meeting in Africa decided they needed to change how people were talking about female farmers. ""A lot of what we were doing for smallholder women farmers wasn't having an impact,"" says Eluka Kibona, who manages Oxfam's involvement with the show.

They wanted less of a ""pity party"" and more of a ""celebration that would give them the status they deserve,"" she adds.

And that's exactly what the program is doing: transforming African women farmers into advocates for agriculture issues.

Chelele, who won season five of Female Food Heroes in Tanzania, has become a community leader. In addition to the grand prize, which included about $10,000, 7 acres of land, and farming and fishing tools, she says in an email to NPR that she has ""generated a small amount of fame, which is wonderful.""

Now that she's a winner, the mother of four and the sole provider for her household educates people and family members in her village about different farming methods. A few times a month, she goes on the local radio station. People call in and ask her about her experiences as a farmer and a women's rights advocate. She answers questions like ""How do I learn to make manure?"" ""How did I modernize my farming technique?"" and of course, ""How do I get on the show?""

Since the television show began in Tanzania, Female Food Heroes competitions and award ceremonies  which Oxfam describes as kind of like a ""beauty pageant""  have been held in Ethiopia and Nigeria. But the program, which started in 2012, has its own set of winners, judges and contestants. Unfortunately, it's not aired on TV.

The contestants don't seem to mind  they're just glad they have a chance to win. Monica Maigari, an energetic 59-year-old farmer, was the first-runner up in Nigeria's 2014 Female Food Heroes challenge.

On top of winning $1,000, which she used to buy land, there are other perks. She's currently in Washington, D.C., helping Oxfam lobby Congress on U.S. legislation to improve global humanitarian response and give local groups the tools and resources they need to act when disaster strikes  an idea that Maigari can stand behind.

And now that she's become a leader in her village  where ""even the men"" respect her, she says  she will use her power to help women farmers. She wants them to learn how to read and write, learn how to use the machines that will pack their food in containers for supermarkets, and get their foodstuffs registered and vetted in Nigeria's version of the FDA.

Don't even get her started on mangoes. ""They drop down and we cannot preserve them, they just go to waste,"" she says. ""It's a serious problem. They rot and we cannot sell them at the market.""

Maigari, who visited NPR this week, noticed our building's rooftop garden, looking pretty dead thanks to winter, and happily gave us some good advice.

She likes that our box garden is ""well-manured,"" and says it would be great for carrots, tomatoes and spinach. But no more than four kinds of crops, she says  that way NPR can ""grow enough to sell at the market.""",[]

i toggle caption PeopleImages.com/Getty Images PeopleImages.com/Getty Images

By the time they're in elementary school, some kids prove to be more troublesome than others. They can't sit still or they're not socializing or they can't focus enough to complete tasks that the other kids are handling well. Sounds like ADHD. But it might be that they're just a little young for their grade.

Studies done in several countries including Iceland, Canada, Israel, Sweden and Taiwan show children who are at the young end of their grade cohort are more likely to get an ADHD diagnosis than their older classmates.

The youngest students were between 20 percent and 100 percent more likely to get the diagnosis or ADHD medication than were the oldest students in the cohort, says Helga Zoega, an epidemiologist at the University of Iceland who worked on the Icelandic and Israeli studies.

The most recent evidence comes from Taiwan, where an analysis showed the youngest students in a grade were roughly 75 percent more likely to get a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder than the oldest ones. It was published Thursday in the Journal of Pediatrics.

Kids are generally 6 years old when they start first grade. A scant few months can span a lot of mental growth at this age.

""Within that age range there is a huge difference in developmental and social and emotional maturity,"" says Dr. Adiaha Spinks-Franklin, a developmental and behavioral pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital who was not involved in any of the studies. ""A 6-year-old is just not the same as a 7-year-old.""

And yet a first grader might stand shoulder to shoulder with another student nearly 12 months her elder. ""And the way we diagnose ADHD is we talk to the parent about the child's behavior, and we mail the teacher questionnaires,"" Spinks-Franklin says. ""The teacher will be comparing the child's behavior relative to other children in the class.""

That could lead to a mistaken diagnosis of ADHD. Zoega says the younger the student, the greater the likelihood that student will receive an ADHD diagnosis or medication. ""If you look at the [students' age] just month by month, you'll see that the likelihood increases with each month,"" she says.

Zoega says the only country studied so far where the relative age of young children doesn't seem to have an effect on ADHD diagnosis is Denmark, where there's more flexibility for when children enter school. So this could be because Danish parents with kids who are born just before the cutoff date for grade school entry choose to hold their offspring back one year.

But if you're an American parent with children born in the months of December, November or October, that doesn't mean a child should repeat a grade for the fear their relative youth will handicap them, Spinks-Franklin says. ""There is absolutely no data to support grade repetition for maturity issues. Children who repeat a grade are at a higher risk of dropping out of high school. They are more likely to be bullied."" If the child does have ADHD or another disorder, she notes, repeating a grade will not fix the disorder.

And relatively younger children diagnosed with ADHD might really have ADHD, says Dr. Mu-Hong Chen, a psychiatrist at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. ""There's a potential for the harm of overdiagnosis and overprescription."" That would unnecessarily subject kids to unwanted side effects of stimulant medication and the stigma of the disorder. But perhaps older, more mature-looking students are just being underdiagnosed and not get help they might need, he says. The studies didn't look into that.

The best thing for worried parents to do is just give the kids a chance to grow up, Chen says. In most of the studies done on relative age and ADHD, the difference in diagnosis rates vanished by the time the students reached their teenage years. ""I think we have to wait for a while, he says. ""We have to have more time to evaluate their behavior, attention and brain development.""

The data also mean that doctors should take the child's relative age into account when diagnosing ADHD, Zoega says. ""It has a sensible solution. Just treat the individual according to his or her age.""",[]

In 2003, Mark and Jay Duplass decided to make a $3 movie  the cost of a mini-DVR tape from a nearby 7-Eleven  which resulted in a short film called ""This Is John."" The short, about a guy trying to create an outgoing message on his answering machine, was accepted into the Sundance Film Festival and quickly launched the careers of the Duplass Brothers.

This was by no means their first filmmaking endeavor. Mark and Jay Duplass started making movies together when they were kids, and continued filmmaking at the University of Texas, with minimal success. ""We had tried to be the Coen Brothers in the early 90s, but we failed miserably because they're the Coen Brothers,"" Jay tells Ask Me Another host Ophira Eisenberg at the Bell House in Brooklyn, NY.

Whether they are producing, directing, writing, or acting, the Duplass Brothers have been involved in an astonishing number of projects, including Cyrus and Jeff, Who Lives At Home. On screen, you might recognize Mark from TBS's The League and Jay from Amazon Video's Transparent, which was Jay's first major role in front of the camera. More recently, the brothers co-created the HBO series Togetherness, also starring Mark, which follows two detached couples living and coping in Los Angeles. The character-driven dramedy focuses on themes of marriage and friendship, drawing upon the brothers' lives.

""When we are writing and directing and producing, sometimes acting in one of our things, it really is like being a parent,"" Mark explains to Eisenberg, ""When we are acting in other shows, it's like being the drunk uncle who shows up with Oreos and plays with the children, but then goes home and doesn't have to deal with everything.""

While other kids were obsessing over Star Wars, the Duplass Brothers were watching hard-hitting, emotional dramas, like Ordinary People, and pretty much anything that aired on daytime HBO in the '80s. For their VIP game, we quiz the siblings on this knowledge, specifically of Academy Award Best Picture Nominees from 1976-1985.

Highlights

On their childhood filmmaking days

Jay: A lot of filmmakers' films from their younger days are prophetic of future genius...ours was not.

Mark: The first [film] was the invisible man walking across the room, where we would move the shoes one foot in front of the other and film them a couple of seconds at a time. And BLOW people's minds. The second one was a remake of The Blob where our blue bean bag just rolled down the stairs.

On their relationship

Mark: We don't fight a lot and we have actually talked about it. We're wondering if maybe we should fight more and we've talked about going to therapy so that we do fight more.

Jay: Try some yelling and screaming.

Mark: We're worried that we're repressing some stuff.

On their breakout success

Jay: We were kind of ready to throw in the towel. I was pushing thirty and was like, ""I got to stop torturing myself and our family with this 'artist' thing."" So, Mark was like, ""Let's just make a movie today."" The story was something that happened to me the day before. I was trying to record a greeting on my answering machine. It was a $3 movie that got into Sundance and did more for our careers than the previous 10 years of trying to be the Coen Brothers.

Mark: And now...as you can see...we own blazers!

Jay: We don't even have to buy these blazers. People give us blazers!",[]

For the second time in as many days, Go champion Lee Sedol fished out one of the playing stones he'd captured from his opponent and placed it back on the board, admitting defeat against the computer program AlphaGo, which now has a 2-0 lead in their best-of-five series.

Lee and AlphaGo will now take a one-day break before continuing their match Saturday. Lee must win the next three games in order to win.

""Yesterday I was surprised, but today, more than that, I'm quite speechless,"" Lee said after the match, according to Go Game Guru. Lee, a multiple winner of world titles, then added, ""... there was not a moment in time where I felt that I was leading the game.""

When asked later about AlphaGo's weaknesses in the board game in which players compete for territory, Sedol answered that he had yet to find any.

YouTube

This game lacked some of the hard-hitting exchanges of the first, with several analysts agreeing that in round two, Lee took a more cautious approach while AlphaGo showed more creativity than on Wednesday. Both sides used some of their allotted overtime, after going through their two-hour periods in the second game  a contest that lasted for 211 moves compared to 186 in game one.

At one point, an unusual decision by AlphaGo, to place a stone near one of Lee's white pieces where little action seemed to be taking place, ""made human champion Lee leave his seat to take a break, or likely to pull himself together after the unconventional move,"" the Korea Herald reports.

Michael Redmond, an elite Go player who's commenting on the games for the Google DeepMind channel on YouTube, said:

""I was impressed with AlphaGo's play. There was a great beauty to the opening. Based on what I had seen from its other games, AlphaGo was always strong in the end and middle game, but that was extended to the beginning game this time. It was a beautiful, innovative game.""

The challenge between Lee and AlphaGo carries a prize of around $1 million, and it has spurred interest in Go, a game that was developed in China centuries ago and is now played by tens of millions of people.

Here's how the American Go Association describes the philosophy behind the game, which has fewer rules than chess but has many more potential variations for how pieces are arranged on the board:

""There is no simple procedure to turn a clear lead into a victory  only continued good play. The game rewards patience and balance over aggression and greed; the balance of influence and territory may shift many times in the course of a game, and a strong player must be prepared to be flexible but resolute. Go thinking seems more lateral than linear, less dependent on logical deduction, and more reliant on a 'feel' for the stones, a 'sense' of shape, a gestalt perception of the game.""

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, whose company created AlphaGo, called Thursday's game ""excruciatingly nerve-wracking""  and he also said that more than 100 million people worldwide had watched the first match online.

i toggle caption Keystone/Getty Images Keystone/Getty Images

I'd already been thinking a lot about George Martin. I've spent the last year writing a book about the songs that changed the lives of musicians, and in the introductory chapter I offer my own selection. ""A Day in the Life,"" by The Beatles, changed the way I think about music. It's a song George Martin, who died on Tuesday at the age of 90, had a clear hand in.

George Martin was 36 when he began working with The Beatles in 1962, a decade and a half older than Paul and John. When you think of rock music of that time, it was basically this: guitar, bass, drums and a few singers. Song structures were simply an intro, a verse, a chorus that might repeat, and often not more than that. Music was for fun, something to sing along to, a bit of comfort when life got you down. The sound of rock and roll, with little exception, was predictable, albeit lovable. When you think of the progression of the music from the end of 1963, when I first heard ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" on the radio, to less than four years later, when The Beatles, with Martin, created and released Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, it's simply mind boggling.

George Martin's skills as an arranger are on all of The Beatles albums: the strings on ""Yesterday,"" a trumpet on ""Penny Lane"" and the crazy brass and strings on ""I Am The Walrus"" are just a few of the ways he stretched the bounds of popular music. What you have to remember is that nothing had sounded like this EVER, and he played a large role in that progression. He was someone for the band to bounce ideas off, to turn the good ideas into reality. As I write in Your Song Changed My Life, the orchestral chaos that blew my mind on ""A Day in the Life"" is based on an idea that George Martin claimed John Lennon gave him, a request he recalled in the book All The Songs: The Story Behind Every Beatles Release: ""What I'd like to hear is a tremendous buildup, from nothing up to something absolutely like the end of the world."" Martin achieved that vision by hiring an orchestra, recording it multiple times, and then layering the recordings to create the massive, overwhelming racket that lifts the song out of the ordinary and then brings it to a halt.

With The Beatles growth from a small, charming combo to this massive musical explosion, pop music became more than a song to sing along with. It became something to lose yourself in, something to commune with. I've come to expect and want that from music. Clearly, so did George Martin. These days, as I sift through thousands of songs for All Songs Considered, what I hope to find is basically the seed that he planted in my young head: that music at its best should be a sonic adventure. His contributions, along with such a talented band in such an experimental time, changed the way so many people make music, all these days later. Thank you for this gift, George Martin. Thank you.",[]

A curious crowd lingered around Amal Graafstra as he carefully unpacked a pair of gloves, a small sterile blanket and a huge needle. A long line of people were waiting to get tiny computer chips implanted into their hands.

Graafstra had set up shop in a booth in the middle of an exhibit hall at the Austin Convention Center, where he gathered last month with several hundred others who call themselves ""body hackers""  people who push the boundaries of implantable technology to improve the human body.

The movement evokes visceral reactions, brings up safety and ethical concerns and quickly veers into sci-fi questions about the line between human and cyborg.

Graafstra is a pioneer in the space. Using his own body to experiment, he designed bio-safe magnets and the microchip he was about to implant into the hand of A.J. Butt, who was sporting a tall, blue mohawk.

toggle caption Eyder Peralta/NPR

The implantable RFID chips hold encrypted information, and their unique ID numbers can be used to open doors or unlock the owner's smartphone, which is what Butt wants to do.

Butt took a deep breath. The needle plunged into his skin at the base of his thumb, and a chip bigger than a grain of rice slipped just below the surface.

Across the way, Sasha Rose, who was working a meditation booth at the convention, watched the people line up to be ""chipped.""

She shook her head: This was the craziest thing she had seen. She wondered about Graafstra's credentials. She thought this was a medical procedure, so should he be performing it? Did his clients know the potential consequences of carrying personal information on a device inside their skin?

""More than the crazy concept, it's actually people's willingness to accept it. That's why it's crazy to me,"" Rose said. ""People are just willing to just line up and go, 'Yeah, stick that in me.' ""

At night, many of the convention goers gathered at a club on Austin's 6th Street.

Graafstra was outside with Ryan O'Shea, whose company Grindhouse Wetware made the Internet squirm earlier this year when it released a close-up surgery video of one of its implants called Northstar. In it, a man gets a small incision in his hand and then, with a metallic tool dipped into it, the skin is lifted to produce a cavity where a round subdermal implant with five LED lights is placed.

The result looks dystopian  the incision is stitched with black thread, and LED lights make the skin on the hand glow red.

But body hackers view the world differently, Graafstra said. They believe technology has reached a point where it can improve the human body instead of just fixing what's broken.

toggle caption Eyder Peralta/NPR

""A patient may someday come very soon and say, 'My eye is totally fine, but I want an eye that can see infrared. And I want an eye that can zoom,' "" Graafstra said.

That kind of future  where the human body is augmented by technology  is the goal of many of these experiments.

O'Shea said Grindhouse Wetware is using its LED device to test how long a device like it can remain charged inside a body, and Graafstra said his RFID chip is a small attempt at merging digital identity with physical identity.

""I think once people realize, 'Oh, it's OK that my grandma has a pacemaker' ... people are going to start to accept this,"" O'Shea said. ""You know, the era of transhumanism, I would say, is here. So let's accept that and then see where that logically takes us.""

Inside the club, a drone hovered above the dance floor. The polished steel and the electronic dance music gave it a futuristic feel.

Standing near the bar was Tony Salvador, who studies social values and how they affect technology at Intel. He was at the conference to get a feel of when and if ""body hacking"" may be accepted into the mainstream.

If we define ourselves as organisms, suddenly our group is wider.

Sometimes, he said, technology moves too fast and outpaces accepted social boundaries  not to mention laws. He argued that was part of the reason why early wearers of Google Glass were called ""glassholes.""

""It created a social misunderstanding,"" Salvador said. ""You didn't know what was going on.""

To Salvador, the boundaries of acceptance are a matter of our social philosophy, an area that he argued was driven by esoteric discourse without tangible moral and ethical recommendations.

The philosophers, he said, are letting us down.

Alva Noe, a philosopher at the University of California, Berkeley, and contributor to NPR's 13.7: Cosmos and Culture blog, has written extensively on what he calls ""cyborgian naturalness."" He disagreed that the modern philosophers dropped the ball, saying that tackling the matter would involve unpacking two questions:

Is it OK to cut into human bodies for these kinds of experiments? How much tolerance should society have for artificially enhancing the body?

To the first question, Noe said he found the ""body hacking"" experimentation on humans ""ethically disturbing"" and couldn't fathom a doctor or any other scientists conducting these kinds of operations.

The second question was more complicated.

""We don't condemn people for using glasses to see better,"" he said. ""But we do start to think taking speed to cope with your work life is questionable.""

Because those kinds of judgments are an ethical question, drawing a tolerance line may always be a moving target, he said.

""We may reach consensuses and then lose them,"" Noe said. ""Just as there was once a consensus where it was OK to smoke to function effectively, and now we have the consensus that, increasingly, it's not OK to do that.""

If there's a rock star in the body hacking movement, that's Neil Harbisson, a colorblind artist from Barcelona, who persuaded a doctor to implant a camera in the back of his head. The antenna, as he calls it, essentially lets Harbisson listen to colors by detecting the dominant color in front of him and translating it into musical notes.

toggle caption Luis Ortiz/LatinContent/Getty Images

The way he tells it, a medical ethics committee in Europe had refused to sign off on the operation but a doctor agreed to perform the surgery anonymously. From it, Harbisson emerged with a camera connected to a device on the back of his skull, its lens dangling in front of his face on a rod that arcs over his head.

As he walked the streets of Austin, he described how he perceived the world: the red traffic light sounded like an A note, the green grass sounded like an F.

In his keynote address at the conference, Harbisson said the first time he heard those colors in his sleep, he felt truly cyborg. Now, he no longer identifies as human, but a ""cybernetic organism.""

""If we define ourselves as organisms, suddenly our group is wider,"" he said. ""We are on the same level as an insect, or as a cat, or as a plant.""

Harbisson is well aware of how the world perceives him. He moved from Barcelona to New York City in search of ""peace"" with another friend in the transhumanist movement, Moon Ribas. Ribas has an electronic device in her arm that she said vibrates when there is an earthquake anywhere in the world.

On more than one occasion, people have tried to rip off his antenna, Harbisson said. That's part of the reason why he co-founded the Cyborg Foundation to advocate for ""cyborg rights.""

When asked if he's ever thought about just taking the antenna off, Harbisson demurred.

""To me, it's much stronger, the wish to sense what's around me than the fact that people keep annoying me,"" he said, adding that maybe, in the future, as others get new senses, he'll be considered normal.",[]

China's economy isn't doing too well these days, but you wouldn't know it from the government's real estate transaction center in Shanghai's Baoshan district. Hundreds of people jam the office every day to put in paperwork for homes they've just purchased. The crowds are so loud and anxious that guards wearing white hardhats and wielding bullhorns patrol the lines to keep order.

In January, home prices in Shanghai were up by more than 15 percent from a year earlier, according to China's National Bureau of Statistics. In the southern city of Shenzhen, prices have jumped by more than 50 percent in the past 12 months.

i toggle caption Frank Langfitt/NPR Frank Langfitt/NPR

""Originally, I didn't plan to buy at this particular time, but now prices have forced me to,"" says a construction worker surnamed Zhang, 50, speaking over the din of the crowd at the transaction center. ""If I don't buy now, future prices will be more unbearable.""

Sitting next to him is Anna Zhang, no relation, who feels the same way. Zhang, who is 27 and works for an export company, has just bought her first home with her husband. The apartment, which is less than 600 square feet, cost the couple more than $200,000, most of which they borrowed from a bank. That's a lot of money in a city where the average annual salary is about $14,000, according to Zhaopin.com, a job recruitment portal.

Anna Zhang says she had no intention of spending so much, but had no choice.

""I would call a homeowner in the morning and he'd offer one price,"" she says. ""When I called him back in the afternoon, there was another price. This happened twice and [the] price jumped anywhere from $7,500 to $15,000.""

Home prices are rising in top-tier cities, including Beijing and Guangzhou, at a time when China's economic growth continues to slow and currency and stock prices remain down. GDP growth was 6.9 percent last year, the lowest rate in a quarter-century. The Shanghai composite has dropped by about 45 percent since its high in June.

What gives? Oliver Rui, who teaches finance at China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, says rising home prices are not a sign of confidence in the economy  but of uncertainty. Many small and mid-size business owners are pouring money into Shanghai real estate because they see it as a safe haven for their capital.

""They think that the outlook of the economy is not clear,"" says Rui. ""They don't want to further invest in their business, so the best way to hedge against inflation is real estate.""

That's because, historically, real estate in top Chinese cities has been a sure bet. If you bought an apartment in downtown Shanghai in, say, the year 2000, you might have seen the value rise 10 times.

Rui, though, warns that continuing to pour money into China's real estate sector isn't good for the economy in the long run. It sidelines capital that could be better used to build a more nimble, innovative economic model that could create better jobs with higher wages.

While China's wealthiest cities are enjoying price runs, huge swaths of apartments in so-called second-, third- and fourth-tier cities in the country's interior are gathering dust. At the end of last year, there were about 182 square miles worth of unsold residential floor space, according to the Chinese government. That's more than the area of Philadelphia.

China's government has cut deed taxes and reduced down payment requirements to try to sell off some of this white-elephant inventory  but many Chinese have neither the cash nor the desire to buy in smaller cities.

""There's a concern that in the future, there will be fewer and fewer policy measures available to get people to buy this housing,"" said Lu Wenxi, a researcher with Centaline, a leading real estate company operating in China. ""If the market weakens further, we'll eventually use up all the tools in our toolbox.""

Officials in the northeastern rust-belt city of Shenyang recently considered offering college graduates housing loans with no down payment. In a culture known for thrift, this sort of sub-prime scheme drew howls online, and the local government put plans on hold.

""That indicates in certain areas,"" says Rui, ""the local government is desperate.""",[]

This week, several Balkan countries slammed their borders shut on migrants, effectively cutting off their main route leading to Northern Europe.

It's causing growing humanitarian concerns as tens of thousands of people who hoped to move north remain stuck in camps in Greece. Meanwhile, EU nations are still struggling to come up with a solution to the crisis.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel criticized the current situation  exacerbated by Austria's decision to impose new border restrictions last month  as ""not durable and sustainable"" in an interview broadcast Thursday.

""This unilateral decision by Austria and subsequently by the Balkan countries on one hand brings us fewer refugees, but on the other hand puts Greece in a very difficult situation,"" Merkel said in an interview with MDR radio, the Associated Press reported.

""The problem is not solved by one (country) making a decision, it must be a decision that is right for all 28,"" she adds.

The closures are creating a bottleneck of migrants in Greece, which has been a main entry point to Europe. Reporter Joanna Kakissis told Morning Edition on Wednesday that there are ""currently more than 35,000 Syrians, Iraqis and Afghans stuck in Greece  in crowded camps mostly.""

Joanna says the Balkan countries are stopping anyone without a visa:

""They really had no choice after Austria imposed these very severe border restrictions last month. Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia, Macedonia  these are all parts of what used to be Yugoslavia. And they have long said they don't have the resources to care for very large groups of asylum seekers. ""Migrants were just transiting through these countries. ... So sometimes they only stayed a few hours before going on to the next border. But with northern Europe closing to migrants, Balkan countries worry that lots of Syrians and Iraqis would be stuck there, just as is happening now in Greece.""

It means the migrants stuck in Greece face tough decisions about their next steps. The Washington Post reports that some are deciding to cross through Hungary, which has earned a ""reputation as the most hostile nation in Europe"" toward migrants.

Hungary's brand-new border fence and the threat of prison sentences for people caught crossing over has pushed migrants to chose other routes. But as the Post reports:

""Now that the neighbors are all closing their own borders, however, asylum seekers are coming back to Hungary. After months in which the number of people caught trying to sneak through the fence dropped nearly to zero, arrests have risen sharply in recent weeks as controls tightened elsewhere. In February alone, nearly 2,500 people were apprehended.""

At a Brussels summit earlier this week, the EU and Turkey indicated they are nearing an agreement to address the flood of migrants, as we reported. The accord is expected to formally block the Western Balkan route, the main path migrants have been using as they head to northern Europe.

As NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson has reported, European leaders ""want Ankara to do a better job of stopping illegal migrants from transiting through Turkey to get to Europe, and to take back rejected asylum seekers that came through Turkey.""

The leaders are scheduled to reconvene on March 17 to discuss the proposal, which is coming under increasing criticism from rights advocates.

U.N. Human Rights Chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein decried the ""race to repel these people,"" which he says is ""picking up momentum,"" in a speech Thursday to the Human Rights Council. He said the draft agreement with Turkey ""raises a number of very serious concerns."" Here's more from Hussein:

""Among my concerns is the potential for collective and arbitrary expulsions, which are illegal. Border restrictions which do not permit determination of circumstance of each individual violate international and European law. ""I must also reiterate my profound concern about the restrictive measures such as erecting fences; denying people access to individualised procedures; and arbitrarily denying entry to people of specific nationalities.""

Human Rights Watch's refugee rights director, Bill Frelick, said in a statement that the emerging EU-Turkey deal has a ""fundamental contradiction"":

""The parties failed to say how individual needs for international protection would be fairly assessed during the rapid-fire mass expulsions the agreed would take place.""

Ultimately, ""refugees should not be used as bargaining chips,"" Frelick says.",[]

In 1903, in a cheery local tavern tucked away in Wells River, Vt., one of America's most successful fat men's clubs was launched.

""We're fat and we're making the most of it!"" was their mantra. ""I've got to be good-natured; I can't fight and I can't run"" was their motto. Members had to be at least 200 pounds, pay a $1 fee to enter and learn a secret handshake and password. Twice a year, members gathered, with meetings announced in advance to allow the men to stuff up in order to meet the minimum weight requirement. A 1904 Boston Globe article described the biannual meetings colorfully:

""This village is full of bulbous and overhanging abdomens and double chinstonight, for the New England Fat Men's Club is in session at Hale's Tavern. The natives, who are mostly bony and angular, have stared with envy at the portly forms and rubicund faces which have arrived on every train.""

The fat men's clubs of the late 19th and early 20th century were spectacular celebrations of the wealth and chubbiness of a bygone era. At once sociological curiosity and anthropological artifact, these clubs were a vestige of perhaps the last time society found corpulence to be worthy of celebration.

Weigh-ins were a competitive event. A New York Times article from 1885 describes the crestfallen reaction of a member of a Connecticut fat men's club upon stepping on the scale. ""I must weigh over 300 pounds now,"" George Kapp boasted. Alas: He came in at a disappointing 243. As the Times reported, ""His friends thought he shrank at least 20 pounds more from grief before evening.""

Daryl Leeworthy, a historian at the U.K.'s Swansea University, says that fat men's clubs weren't just an East Coast phenomenon: Nevada, Utah and Tennessee boasted versions as well. And he says the clubs weren't just venues to celebrate the joys of eating without concern and brag about one's girth: They were, essentially, networking events. Memphis' fat men's baseball club had a reception committee replete with judges, ministers and a rabbi, he says. Populist Democrat William Jennings Bryan traveled to a Fat Men's Club in Concord, Mass., to drum up support for one of his presidential runs, Leeworthy says.

What did one do at a fat men's club gathering? Well, eat, of course  a lot. At its peak, the New England's Fat Men's Club had 10,000 members, according to writer Polly Tafrate's brief history of the club for Upper Valley Life. The men would cram huge breakfasts into their bellies, then stumble outside and work up a sweat in a friendly Olympics-style competition showcasing strength and virility: leap-frog contests, broad jumps and races, Tafrate writes.

The exertion also served to jumpstart appetite for the indulgent dinner spread that awaited members at sundown. It was a ridiculous amount of food, Tafrate writes:

""One nine-course menu included oyster cocktail, cream of chicken soup, boiled snapper, fillet of beef with mushrooms, roast chicken, roast suckling pig, shrimp salad, steamed fruit pudding with brandy sauce, assorted cakes, cheese and ice cream followed by coffee and cigars. The evening was laced with large portions of wit, sarcasm and roaring laughter.""

Even at the height of chubby chic, being grossly, morbidly obese was never celebrated as a sign of beauty and wealth, explains Peter Stearns, a professor of history at George Mason University and author of Fat History. He notes that, while having wide hips and some girth was considered attractive for a woman  indicating her prosperity and fertility  ""fat ladies"" were often mocked and included as a freak show element in traveling circuses. Fat men weren't similarly lampooned, though they, too, faced ridicule: Tafrate's article mentions a child exclaiming, ""Gee, look at that stomach! Let's get under it and keep out of the rain!""

However, female versions of Fat Men's Clubs did exist, according to Leeworthy. He points to a Hazleton, Pa., venue whose female members weighed 236 pounds on average. But Leeworthy says the opposite fat women's reduction clubs  were far more common.

""One of these existed in Chicago just after the First World War and aimed at promoting responsible diet among the city's overweight women,"" Leeworthy told us in an email. ""Even in the 19th century, diet pills (sometimes known as 'obesity pills') were advertised. ... In a world where power and status mattered a great deal, this was yet another reminder that women tended to have neither.""

Fat men's clubs were not a uniquely American phenomenon  though they were more popular here than elsewhere, Leeworthy adds. There was a French version  Les Cents Kilos, or ""The Hundred Kilos""  formed in 1897 that didn't quite take off. The Serbian capital of Belgrade created a version in 1932. He says Britain's version of the club had a twist: Members who didn't meet the weight requirement had to pay a fine, which was donated to charity.

Throughout history, there have been wavering ideas about ideal body type. As Leeworthy notes, ""Traditionally, being fat was closely associated with wealth and status. For most of our ancestors, the poorer they were, the less food they had to eat, and the thinner and shorter they tended to be. And power and wealth and status are attractive characteristics: If a person's body is their temple, then being the size of a cathedral told others that you were someone of significance.""

But as the Industrial Revolution began to change the way we worked and ate, views about fat and health also began to shift. ""An increasing number of people had jobs that weren't physically demanding,"" Stearns notes. And the advent of modern agricultural methods made food supply more reliable. ""For the bulk of the middle class, the pendulum began to swing,"" he says. In other words, people were expending less energy and were more confident about getting a meal.

In some ways, Fat Men's clubs were a last hurrah for celebrations of corpulence. As Stearns writes in Fat History, ""In general, in a trend that began around 1910, doctors and insurance actuaries began to push preferability of underweight to overweight, in terms of health and longevity.""

Being fat was no longer so feted. Membership at fat men's clubs began to dwindle, as did waistlines. For instance, at the last meeting of the New England Fat Men's Club, in 1924, only 38 members showed up  none of whom met the 200-pound mark, Tafrate reports.

Today, body image faces a new chapter. Gone are Twiggy-inspired skinny legs; curvy, more realistic Barbies are set to hit the market to reflect actual bodies. Thigh gaps, hot dog legs, and waist trainers, while still a part of the popular lexicon, are criticized for promoting unhealthy body images.

While it's unlikely that Fat Men's Clubs will ever catch on again, current trends towards body acceptance might yet nudge us toward that Goldilocks level of body image: not too fat, not too thin, just plain healthy.

In 1903, in a cheery local tavern tucked away in Wells River, Vt., one of America's most successful fat men's clubs was launched.

""We're fat and we're making the most of it!"" was their mantra. ""I've got to be good-natured; I can't fight and I can't run"" was their motto. Members had to be at least 200 pounds, pay a $1 fee to enter and learn a secret handshake and password. Twice a year, members gathered, with meetings announced in advance to allow the men to stuff up in order to meet the minimum weight requirement. A 1904 Boston Globe article described the biannual meetings colorfully:

""This village is full of bulbous and overhanging abdomens and double chinstonight, for the New England Fat Men's Club is in session at Hale's Tavern. The natives, who are mostly bony and angular, have stared with envy at the portly forms and rubicund faces which have arrived on every train.""

i toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Canada and the U.S. have announced a cooperative plan to tackle climate change by cutting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, investing in clean energy research and reducing future hydrofluorocarbon use.

At a joint press conference in the White House Rose Garden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Obama praised the strong ties between Canada and the U.S. They also announced plans to further facilitate trade between the two countries and expressed a shared commitment to protect the environment.

""As the first U.S. president to visit the Arctic, I saw how both of our nations are threatened by rising seas, melting permafrost, disappearing glaciers and sea ice,"" Obama said.

""The president and I share a common goal: We want a clean-growth economy that continues to provide good jobs and great opportunities for all of our citizens,"" Trudeau said. ""And I'm confident that by working together, we'll get there sooner than we think.""

Trudeau's visit to the White House is the first by a sitting Canadian prime minister in nearly two decades. And the collaborative approach to regulating the oil and gas industry comes after years of tension between the Obama and Canadian leaders over the White House's opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline.

Trudeau, who assumed his post in November, is just starting his time as the leader of Canada; Obama, for his part, is in his final year in office. But Obama told reporters he's confident that their agreement will survive the next administration.

The two leaders have committed to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent, relative to 2012 levels, by 2025, and to join a World Bank campaign to reduce routine flaring at gas and oil operations.

Their joint statement on climate change efforts included a number of other shared commitments, including:

Ratifying the Paris Agreement as soon as possible

Implementing aligned emission standards for tractor-trailers and buses (in addition to existing standards for cars and light trucks)

Phasing down use of hydrofluorocarbons, an alternative to CFCs that don't damage the ozone layer but do contribute to climate change.

Making it easier for renewable energy to be integrated into existing power grids in the two nations

Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies

Improving the efficiency of appliances and equipment

The Keystone XL pipeline  which strained ties between the U.S. and Canada over the past few years, and dominated discussions of energy between the two nations  was not mentioned.

The two leaders also expressed a desire to collaborate to protect the Arctic beyond reducing the impact of climate change. They set a goal of protecting 17 percent of Arctic land and 10 percent of marine areas, and said they were committed to involving indigenous leaders, as well as traditional knowledge, in decisions related to the Arctic.

The shared commitment to fighting climate change, in particular, was received as a significant shift in both nations' positions.

Last year, NPR's Christopher Joyce wrote that when it came to international cooperation on climate change, ""the U.S. government has been like the big-ticket movie star who has been offered the lead role, but won't commit.""

And Canada? In The New Republic last fall, Rebecca Leber called Canada under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper a ""climate villain.""

With Thursday's joint statement, Obama and Trudeau indicated they now want their countries to step to the forefront of the global conversation on climate change.

""We know that our international partners expect  and indeed need  leadership from us on this issue,"" Trudeau said.",[]

i toggle caption Ray Mickshaw/FX Ray Mickshaw/FX

In 1995, the televised trial of O.J. Simpson riveted the nation. Lead prosecutor Marcia Clark made the case against the hall-of-fame football player, who was accused of the brutal double homicide of his ex-wife and her friend.

Throughout the trial, Clark faced tremendous scrutiny. She was criticized for courtroom decisions as well as for her hairstyle, clothing and her personal life. Many ultimately blamed her for Simpson's acquittal.

The feeling at the time was that ""Marcia Clark is a strident shrew bitch-person,"" actress Sarah Paulson tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross. Paulson portrays Clark in FX's The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story. While preparing for the role, she watched video footage of Clark during the Simpson trial and read her memoir. Later, she also met Clark in person.

""My impressions of her now, after portraying her, are incredibly, vastly different,"" Paulson says. ""I now hold her to be a very competent, complicated, strong, deep-thinking, quick-witted, quick-draw, wonderful creature.""

The People v. O.J. Simpson is co-produced Ryan Murphy, who also co-created the FX anthology series American Horror Story, which Paulson has appeared in for all five of its seasons.

Though the O.J. series has been gaining a lot of attention, Paulson says she's waiting until some of the buzz dies down before watching. ""I think it's the first time in my professional life I have felt a real swell of positive feeling about my work in something,"" she says. ""I'm trying to just enjoy that, because I know that if I watch it I'm going to start picking it apart, and I think it would be a nice treat for myself to give myself a minute of enjoyment to celebrate the work.""

Interview Highlights

On how much the truth matters when portraying real events in a television show

I think it's of paramount importance, and at the same time it is a television show and it is a dramatization. There is no way to know exactly what Marcia Clark was feeling ... and how she cries privately, and there are many, many things that cannot be known. ... I just sort of have to kind of get behind knowing that the bulk of it is all true, and the moments that cannot be known  except for by the people that were actually there and lived it  that's where the acting comes in and the clever writing, at least you hope. I think the whole thing in general  everything was incredibly well-vetted and all of that.

On how she prepared to play Clark

I read, watched and listened to any and everything I could get my hands on. The good news is there are copious amounts of videos on the Internet where I was able to watch a lot of her physical [mannerisms]  her carriage, the way she used her hands, the way she spoke, how she often tilted her head to one side, particularly in the courtroom when she was addressing the judge, the defense team or the jury. I read her book, I read [Christopher] Darden's book [In Contempt], I read [Jeffrey] Toobin's book [The Run of His Life], and of course I read our scripts, which was probably where I ended up holding most closely that stuff. ...

The more I read about her, the more I knew about her, the more I just wanted to get it right. That was my primary concern, was just to get it right  and by right I mean just for it to be authentic and truthful. I wasn't really looking at it as a way of trying to correct any perceptions or misconceptions about Marcia, I just wanted to try to do it in an honorable and a truthful way.

On why she wanted to meet Clark in person

I don't even know that I wanted to know anything specific, I just wanted to breathe the same air that she was breathing, in the same moment. I had so immersed myself in all things Marcia Rachel Clark that the idea that I could be sitting across from her ... I just kind of wanted to hug her. I wanted to look her in the eye and tell her that she didn't have to be fearful of the take that was going to be presented about her, given all that I knew she had endured.

I could've only imagined and anticipated that she was going to be terribly, terribly anxious about having to relive this experience that was a great trauma for her. She never went back into the courtroom to prosecute a case after this trial and she had won 19 out of 20 prior to this case, so it was obviously a great passion of hers and it was stolen from her. I don't know that I took anything away from it or expected anything other than I just wanted to be in her orbit.

On the scrutiny she has encountered over her appearance, which helped her relate to the scrutiny Clark faced during the trial

I have naturally brown hair and every time I've been asked to be a leading lady on television or in a movie I have often been asked to make my hair blonde. And that is a sort of a weird slippery slope where you start to go, ""Gosh ... if my job on this particular program is supposed to be alluring or charming, thought of as a sexual creature, I have to have blonde hair? What does it mean that I don't actually have blonde hair? Does it mean that I am not any of those things without it?""

On playing conjoined twins on American Horror Story

Essentially, it was all done on a green screen and I would come in in the morning and prerecord my dialogue, because often the twins were speaking telepathically to one another and I wanted to be able to hear my own voice in my head. So I would record it and then wear an earwig so that I could talk to myself. I didn't want to have another actress off camera reading that didn't sound like me and didn't sound like my twin.

i toggle caption FX FX

It was a lot of lonely work, where I would have to look at a piece of tape and imagine my own head there. I never was able to look in anyone else's eyes to play a scene with myself. ... It was incredibly challenging and very, very technical. And everyone who ever did a scene with me on that season of Horror Story was always bemoaning the fact that they had to work with me because it meant their day was infinitely longer because it was just take after take, and we essentially had to do everything twice.

On making news after she kissed then-girlfriend Cherry Jones at the 2005 Tony Awards

I think I was a bit naive, actually, as to what it would mean. I was just doing what was instinctual to me, which was to congratulate and kiss the person whom I loved and who had just won a very fancy acting prize. It would've been strange for me to what, I don't know, pat her on the head, pat her on the shoulder, and I just did what it occurred to me to do. But I was very quickly made aware of it being a bit of a news [story] because I got a phone call from my publicist saying, ""Why did you do that?"" She's no longer my publicist, by the way. ...

I remember feeling like I was getting my hand slapped, that I had done something wrong, and I didn't feel very comfortable with that.

On whether she worries that being, as she puts it, sexually ""fluid"" affects the kinds of roles she gets

I wonder sometimes if being in the Ryan Murphy world  in that I get to play so many different types of characters within that one TV show  that there really isn't time to sort of typecast me as one particular kind of thing. I'm not a sex symbol, I'm not ... your typical movie star. And so I wonder if I've been sort of protected from having to worry about it preventing me from working in a way, because the public doesn't really have a particular attachment to me being one type of thing.

On whether society has become more accepting of fluid sexual orientation

The politicization of it is complicated for me, because I only know what to do according to what I feel and I only want to be governed by that. I try not to make any choices across the board that are dictated to me by someone else's idea of what [my sexuality] should be. So I do hope that the idea of somebody being fluid is no longer a covert or a euphemism for ""Oh, gay, just don't want to say it."" Because for me, I have been with men and I have been with women, and I don't know what lies ahead, and I don't want to be stuck with some kind of label that then makes me then a traitor to my people if I make a different choice. I want the freedom  my own personal freedom  to decide that as I see fit.

On her current relationship with actress Holland Taylor, who is about 30 years older

There is a very significant age difference. And when you love a person, the idea of losing them is terrifying, to put it mildly. So I have thought about it. But Holland actually put the best spin on it and said what I think was a very funny thing. ... We were at a dinner party and we were newly out and about as a couple, and a mutual friend of ours said, ""Oh, Holland, I'm so pleased for you. I'm so happy, this is so great, you and Sarah."" And Holland said, ""Yeah, I know. Look, if she dies, she dies."" It was so disarming. And Holland's point being: Yes, on paper, it looks like one thing, but anything can happen and you just don't know.",[]
npr.org,2016-03-10 00:00:00,How Best To Test For Zika Virus? : Shots,[],"How Best To Test For Zika Virus?

i toggle caption Arnulfo Franco/AP Arnulfo Franco/AP

Let's say you're a pregnant woman who recently traveled to Latin America or the Caribbean. You got a little sick shortly after the trip, with some combination of mild fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis. The big question now is: Did you have Zika virus? And, if so, is your fetus still healthy?

""Probably every day, patients come in questioning whether or not they would qualify for testing,"" says Dr. Christine Curry, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Miami, and Jackson Memorial Hospital.

A preliminary study in Brazil makes a strong case for the link between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and a number of birth defects, including microcephaly. The infection has been associated with a range of outcomes in another study of nine U.S. women who caught the virus while traveling to regions where Zika is prevalent.

If a patient has a particular travel history, Curry sends a sample of the woman's blood to a lab for analysis. But it can take awhile for test results to come back, Curry says, and the waiting can be really stressful, especially for patients in the middle of a pregnancy.

""They're trying to decide what to do with the pregnancy, given so many unknowns,"" she says. ""The difference between two and four weeks can be the difference between being able to end a pregnancy and not.""

There's another problem: Some tests aren't very reliable, so patients sometimes have to go through multiple rounds to confirm whether they had Zika. That puts Curry in a tricky situation when she's counseling patients.

""It involves saying 'I don't know' and 'no one knows' over and over again,"" she says.

Until recently, most samples of fluids from patients had to be sent to Atlanta for testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now, about 30 local public health labs are gearing up to do the analysis themselves, including the District of Columbia's department of forensic sciences, where Cleveland Weeden works as a medical technologist.

Most days, Weeden says, he feels like an athlete stuck on the bench. Outbreaks are exciting, in a way, because he finally gets to put his expertise and skills to work.

""We're the bench,"" Weeden says. ""We get called into action when something goes on in the city.""

A refrigerator behind Weeden holds plastic baggies with tubes of blood and urine from patients in the area. As of this week, his job is to test all these samples for Zika virus.

Weeden expects to get the results to patients within three days, rather than four weeks. He's running a procedure called RT-PCR  or Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction. The CDC has produced about 375,000 kits that can perform this test. It looks for pieces of the virus' genetic material and answers ""yes"" or ""no"" to the question: ""Is there virus in this person's blood?""

Weeden says the test is pretty straightforward  except for one thing.

""From the time the person is bitten [by an infected mosquito] to the time they get to the doctor, no more than five to seven days can pass for us to [be able to] pick it up on PCR,"" he says.

That means that if PCR is to work, doctors have to collect patients' blood within a week of the first signs of a fever and rash. The virus hangs around a little longer in urine, so doctors would have a slightly longer window of time  about two weeks  to collect those samples. But there's an extra complication, Curry says: Most patients don't rush to the doctor when their illness is mild.

""If someone had virus in their blood three weeks ago and they're now cleared, the PCR's not going to tell you that,"" she says. In that case, a negative result could mean either that the person never had Zika, or that their body had already cleared it from their system by the time they got tested.

That's why labs like Weeden's are trying to get hold of another kind of test that the CDC developed, which goes by yet another bulky acronym  the Zika MAC-ELISA. This test looks for a protein in a person's blood  a specific type of antibody  that shows what foreign things the body has fought off recently.

The Zika MAC-ELISA is widely seen as the best test available, right now, because it works over a longer time span than the first option. It's also faster and cheaper than another more definitive test, and requires less specialized training to perform. According to the CDC, Zika antibodies appear in the blood ""starting 4 to 5 days after the start of illness and last for up to 12 weeks,"" or even longer in some people.

The CDC has produced about 100,000 of these test kits, and is offering them free to qualified labs. But there's one drawback: The test sometimes tells people they had Zika when they didn't.

An ideal test, all agree, would be specific to this particular virus and give a faster turnaround time  eliminating the need for the manpower, money and time required to go through the current layers of testing.

It's not just pregnant women who would benefit from a better test  so would patients who need blood transfusions in places like Puerto Rico, where health officials have been worried that patients might accidentally get Zika during transfusions with infected blood. So the officials have stopped accepting local donations and, instead, are now getting blood shipped in from the continental U.S.

The third, more definitive, test is called PRNT, or the plaque-reduction neutralization test. Because PRNT is expensive and takes at least a week longer to do than the Zika MAC-ELISA, the ELISA test is widely considered the more practical option in many cases.

""And herein lies where science needs to innovate a bit,"" says Ted Pierson, a virologist and senior investigator at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Sometime in December, Pierson and colleagues in his molecular virology lab dropped their work on dengue virus so they could press the pedal to the metal on Zika. Pierson's work doesn't focus on pregnant women or blood transfusions.

""I am focused on amino acids, hydroxyls and phosphates,"" he explains. His team is trying to figure out how to make a better version of the antibody test  the Zika MAC-ELISA test the CDC is distributing to labs.

""The problem here is actually quite simple,"" Pierson explains. Viruses in the same family  in Zika's case, the flaviviruses  can look similar on the outside, and the antibodies the human immune system uses to fight them can also be similar.

So, if a person had been infected sometime along the way with another mosquito-borne virus in that family, like dengue or West Nile  or even if they simply had been vaccinated against yellow fever  they could test positive in a Zika antibody test.

""It's a good example of where the devil is in the details,"" Pierson says, and those details are what he and his colleagues are delving into now.

""What we, as a field, need to do is develop antigens that allow us to distinguish between the antibodies specific to Zika, versus those for other flaviviruses,"" he says.

The group is essentially stripping down the virus to figure out what is unique to Zika  what distinguishes it from related viruses. The researchers are particularly interested in proteins, like the ""fusion loop,"" that lie on top of the virus and help it enter a human cell. Once those unique parts are identified, it might be possible to create a more specific test that has much lower odds of triggering false positives.

That could take days to figure out  or months, Pierson says.

By the time they're in elementary school, some kids prove to be more troublesome than others. They can't sit still or they're not socializing or they can't focus enough to complete tasks that the other kids are handling well. Sounds like ADHD. But it might be that they're just a little young for their grade.

Studies done in several countries including Iceland, Canada, Israel, Sweden and Taiwan show children who are at the young end of their grade cohort are more likely to get an ADHD diagnosis than their older classmates.

The youngest students were between 20 percent and 100 percent more likely to get the diagnosis or ADHD medication than were the oldest students in the cohort, says Helga Zoega, an epidemiologist at the University of Iceland who worked on the Icelandic and Israeli studies.

The most recent evidence comes from Taiwan, where an analysis showed the youngest students in a grade were roughly 75 percent more likely to get a diagnosis of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder than the oldest ones. It was published Thursday in the Journal of Pediatrics.

Kids are generally 6 years old when they start first grade. A scant few months can span a lot of mental growth at this age.

""Within that age range there is a huge difference in developmental and social and emotional maturity,"" says Dr. Adiaha Spinks-Franklin, a developmental and behavioral pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital who was not involved in any of the studies. ""A 6-year-old is just not the same as a 7-year-old.""

And yet a first grader might stand shoulder to shoulder with another student nearly 12 months her elder. ""And the way we diagnose ADHD is we talk to the parent about the child's behavior, and we mail the teacher questionnaires,"" Spinks-Franklin says. ""The teacher will be comparing the child's behavior relative to other children in the class.""

That could lead to a mistaken diagnosis of ADHD. Zoega says the younger the student, the greater the likelihood that student will receive an ADHD diagnosis or medication. ""If you look at the [students' age] just month by month, you'll see that the likelihood increases with each month,"" she says.

Zoega says the only country studied so far where the relative age of young children doesn't seem to have an effect on ADHD diagnosis is Denmark, where there's more flexibility for when children enter school. So this could be because Danish parents with kids who are born just before the cutoff date for grade school entry choose to hold their offspring back one year.

But if you're an American parent with children born in the months of December, November or October, that doesn't mean a child should repeat a grade for the fear their relative youth will handicap them, Spinks-Franklin says. ""There is absolutely no data to support grade repetition for maturity issues. Children who repeat a grade are at a higher risk of dropping out of high school. They are more likely to be bullied."" If the child does have ADHD or another disorder, she notes, repeating a grade will not fix the disorder.

And relatively younger children diagnosed with ADHD might really have ADHD, says Dr. Mu-Hong Chen, a psychiatrist at Taipei Veterans General Hospital. ""There's a potential for the harm of overdiagnosis and overprescription."" That would unnecessarily subject kids to unwanted side effects of stimulant medication and the stigma of the disorder. But perhaps older, more mature-looking students are just being underdiagnosed and not get help they might need, he says. The studies didn't look into that.

The best thing for worried parents to do is just give the kids a chance to grow up, Chen says. In most of the studies done on relative age and ADHD, the difference in diagnosis rates vanished by the time the students reached their teenage years. ""I think we have to wait for a while, he says. ""We have to have more time to evaluate their behavior, attention and brain development.""

The data also mean that doctors should take the child's relative age into account when diagnosing ADHD, Zoega says. ""It has a sensible solution. Just treat the individual according to his or her age.""",[]

i toggle caption Courtesy of SyFy Courtesy of SyFy

The smoke has now cleared on the first season of SyFy's ambitious adaptation of The Expanse books.

Just before the series aired, I wrote a post pleading to the gods of science fiction to please, please, please not let television destroy this thing of beauty I love so dearly. With the final credits rolled up, it's time to answer that all-important question.

Did it suck?

The answer, as we will see, tells us not just about the success or failure of a particular show but also about the nature of fandom in a world awash in stories.

So, let's start with the answer to the suck question. I am happy, so happy, to report that SyFy's The Expanse did not suck. In fact, it did not suck so much that it was the best and most important piece of science fiction to appear on the small screen in a decade.

To unpack the assessment, let's start with a little background. The Expanse is not your ordinary sci-fi story. There are no warp drives and no aliens with prosthetic forehead appendages. Set in our own solar system a few hundred years in the future, the narrative stays true to what technology might allow as humanity becomes an interplanetary culture. The realism of a day-to-day world where whole populations make their homes on other solar system worlds is what sets the first books in the series apart.

Remarkably, the show delivered on the promise of that realism. What makes the The Expanse so exciting is how hard the creative team worked to bring the science's lived-reality to bear in a way that has not been seen since 2001 A Space Odyssey.

Much of the action, for example, takes place inside the asteroid Ceres, which has been hollowed out and spun-up to create a version of artificial gravity. But while spinning something allows you create a gravity-like pull (a push really), it also leaves you dealing with the Coriolis force that bends the path of falling objects (it's the same ""force"" that bends hurricanes into their giant swirls). So, in the show we see characters pouring a drink while holding a glass off to the side as the stream corkscrews downward.

Another example of lived scientific realism comes in the many spaceship scenes. When the engines are on and you're accelerating between planets, your feet are pinned to the floor. Thrust equals gravity as Einstein showed us. But once you cut the engines, you're back in free-fall and everything goes weightless. This leads to one particularly gruesome scene with a basketball-sized floating orb of blood that I won't go into more detail about. Bleech!

Now you might think I'm just being a nerdy physicist with all this, ""Oh my God, they got the Coriolis force right!"" Well, yes, I'm afraid that's true. I was, in fact, jumping up and down on my couch during that scene.

But while I might have gotten more excited about these kinds of things than your average viewer  and I did calculate the spin rate required to give Ceres 1/3 Earth gravity  there is a deeper point. It's exactly this attention to detail that made the difference for the show's world building. Without it, the internal logic of a universe where Earth and Mars are superpowers standing at the edge of war would fall apart. And without giving us a vision for the realities of a life in space, the impoverished third-world status of societies living in the asteroid belt would have become a cartoon rather than an extension of realities we know today.

So, my verdict is that the show nailed the externalities as much as the constraints of budgets and filming on Earth allowed. But that's really just half the battle. Without characters you really love or hate, getting the physics right (or right-ish) would mean nothing more than expensive sets and a lot of CGI. It was the characters that made the difference between the books and the show really interesting.

The first book of the series is really two stories that slowly converge. On the one hand, we have Josephus Miller, a hard-nosed detective on Ceres chasing down a missing persons case that smells wrong. The noir elements of Miller's ambiguous morality are one of the books' great delights and the actor Thomas Jane perfectly captures the dark, exhausted spirit of the character. From the wise cracks to owning ""that ridiculous hat,"" Jane understood exactly how to update Sam Spade to the asteroid belt.

The second narrative involved the crew of the stolen (""salvaged"") Martian war ship the Rocinate: Capt. James Holden (Steven Strait), engineer Naomi Nagata (Dominique Tipper), pilot Alex Kumar (Can Anvar) and general badass Amos Burton (Wes Chatham). In the book, these characters know each other well and already have a bond when the story starts. The show changes these relationships allowing the viewer to become familiar with them as they slowly discover and slowly learn to trust each other. The actors did an exceptional job breathing life and humanity to their characters.

Finally there's UN diplomat/security chief Chrisjen Avasarala who does not appear in the books until the second volume. The show brings her front center  and actor Shohreh Aghdashloo mixes elegance with a viper's acumen for attack and parry in her portrayal of the spy master. The only complaint one might raise is that in the book Avasarala has a potty mouth that could singe steel. Given its PG-13 approach, the show unfortunately drops her delightful profanity.

And it's here that things get interesting in a more general sense. I fell in love with the show's complex characters and their gradually converging story lines. But they were not the same as the books' characters and their narratives were not the same as the books' stories. They were close, but different. In that way, watching The Expanse was like discovering my favorite story set in a slightly parallel universe. Things were both same and different and that, for me, said a whole lot about the role our cherished stories play in modern life.

From Sherlock Holmes to Jane Austin to Batman, culture in the era of mass media has meant the evolution of a kind of ""fandom"" which seems like something fundamentally new. Human beings are storytellers. From early myths to Shakespeare, this is how we understand ourselves. But since the beginning of the 20th century, we have developed ever more layered ways to tell our stories.

Sherlock Holmes appears in books and then on stage and then in movies and then on TV and then back again to new books. We love his character so much that we seem to need to keep telling those stories. This includes finding new ways to tell them, adapting and altering and adding-on in the process. For some, these changes and additions can be a violation of the original's ""canon"" (a term of particular nerdiness). But, if done well, they allow us to revisit the stories and delight in them again, finding new and creative directions that ultimately show us why we loved the original so deeply.

So in that way and many more, SyFy's The Expanse succeeded where it could easily have failed. To the entire creative team, I bow deeply and say, simply, ""thank you.""

i toggle caption General Photographic Agency/Getty Images General Photographic Agency/Getty Images

In 1903, in a cheery local tavern tucked away in Wells River, Vt., one of America's most successful fat men's clubs was launched.

""We're fat and we're making the most of it!"" was their mantra. ""I've got to be good-natured; I can't fight and I can't run"" was their motto. Members had to be at least 200 pounds, pay a $1 fee to enter and learn a secret handshake and password. Twice a year, members gathered, with meetings announced in advance to allow the men to stuff up in order to meet the minimum weight requirement. A 1904 Boston Globe article described the biannual meetings colorfully:

""This village is full of bulbous and overhanging abdomens and double chinstonight, for the New England Fat Men's Club is in session at Hale's Tavern. The natives, who are mostly bony and angular, have stared with envy at the portly forms and rubicund faces which have arrived on every train.""

The fat men's clubs of the late 19th and early 20th century were spectacular celebrations of the wealth and chubbiness of a bygone era. At once sociological curiosity and anthropological artifact, these clubs were a vestige of perhaps the last time society found corpulence to be worthy of celebration.

Weigh-ins were a competitive event. A New York Times article from 1885 describes the crestfallen reaction of a member of a Connecticut fat men's club upon stepping on the scale. ""I must weigh over 300 pounds now,"" George Kapp boasted. Alas: He came in at a disappointing 243. As the Times reported, ""His friends thought he shrank at least 20 pounds more from grief before evening.""

Daryl Leeworthy, a historian at the U.K.'s Swansea University, says that fat men's clubs weren't just an East Coast phenomenon: Nevada, Utah and Tennessee boasted versions as well. And he says the clubs weren't just venues to celebrate the joys of eating without concern and brag about one's girth: They were, essentially, networking events. Memphis' fat men's baseball club had a reception committee replete with judges, ministers and a rabbi, he says. Populist Democrat William Jennings Bryan traveled to a Fat Men's Club in Concord, Mass., to drum up support for one of his presidential runs, Leeworthy says.

What did one do at a fat men's club gathering? Well, eat, of course  a lot. At its peak, the New England's Fat Men's Club had 10,000 members, according to writer Polly Tafrate's brief history of the club for Upper Valley Life. The men would cram huge breakfasts into their bellies, then stumble outside and work up a sweat in a friendly Olympics-style competition showcasing strength and virility: leap-frog contests, broad jumps and races, Tafrate writes.

The exertion also served to jumpstart appetite for the indulgent dinner spread that awaited members at sundown. It was a ridiculous amount of food, Tafrate writes:

""One nine-course menu included oyster cocktail, cream of chicken soup, boiled snapper, fillet of beef with mushrooms, roast chicken, roast suckling pig, shrimp salad, steamed fruit pudding with brandy sauce, assorted cakes, cheese and ice cream followed by coffee and cigars. The evening was laced with large portions of wit, sarcasm and roaring laughter.""

Even at the height of chubby chic, being grossly, morbidly obese was never celebrated as a sign of beauty and wealth, explains Peter Stearns, a professor of history at George Mason University and author of Fat History. He notes that, while having wide hips and some girth was considered attractive for a woman  indicating her prosperity and fertility  ""fat ladies"" were often mocked and included as a freak show element in traveling circuses. Fat men weren't similarly lampooned, though they, too, faced ridicule: Tafrate's article mentions a child exclaiming, ""Gee, look at that stomach! Let's get under it and keep out of the rain!""

However, female versions of Fat Men's Clubs did exist, according to Leeworthy. He points to a Hazleton, Pa., venue whose female members weighed 236 pounds on average. But Leeworthy says the opposite fat women's reduction clubs  were far more common.

""One of these existed in Chicago just after the First World War and aimed at promoting responsible diet among the city's overweight women,"" Leeworthy told us in an email. ""Even in the 19th century, diet pills (sometimes known as 'obesity pills') were advertised. ... In a world where power and status mattered a great deal, this was yet another reminder that women tended to have neither.""

Fat men's clubs were not a uniquely American phenomenon  though they were more popular here than elsewhere, Leeworthy adds. There was a French version  Les Cents Kilos, or ""The Hundred Kilos""  formed in 1897 that didn't quite take off. The Serbian capital of Belgrade created a version in 1932. He says Britain's version of the club had a twist: Members who didn't meet the weight requirement had to pay a fine, which was donated to charity.

Throughout history, there have been wavering ideas about ideal body type. As Leeworthy notes, ""Traditionally, being fat was closely associated with wealth and status. For most of our ancestors, the poorer they were, the less food they had to eat, and the thinner and shorter they tended to be. And power and wealth and status are attractive characteristics: If a person's body is their temple, then being the size of a cathedral told others that you were someone of significance.""

But as the Industrial Revolution began to change the way we worked and ate, views about fat and health also began to shift. ""An increasing number of people had jobs that weren't physically demanding,"" Stearns notes. And the advent of modern agricultural methods made food supply more reliable. ""For the bulk of the middle class, the pendulum began to swing,"" he says. In other words, people were expending less energy and were more confident about getting a meal.

In some ways, Fat Men's clubs were a last hurrah for celebrations of corpulence. As Stearns writes in Fat History, ""In general, in a trend that began around 1910, doctors and insurance actuaries began to push preferability of underweight to overweight, in terms of health and longevity.""

Being fat was no longer so feted. Membership at fat men's clubs began to dwindle, as did waistlines. For instance, at the last meeting of the New England Fat Men's Club, in 1924, only 38 members showed up  none of whom met the 200-pound mark, Tafrate reports.

Today, body image faces a new chapter. Gone are Twiggy-inspired skinny legs; curvy, more realistic Barbies are set to hit the market to reflect actual bodies. Thigh gaps, hot dog legs, and waist trainers, while still a part of the popular lexicon, are criticized for promoting unhealthy body images.

While it's unlikely that Fat Men's Clubs will ever catch on again, current trends towards body acceptance might yet nudge us toward that Goldilocks level of body image: not too fat, not too thin, just plain healthy.

In 1995, the televised trial of O.J. Simpson riveted the nation. Lead prosecutor Marcia Clark made the case against the hall-of-fame football player, who was accused of the brutal double homicide of his ex-wife and her friend.

Throughout the trial, Clark faced tremendous scrutiny. She was criticized for courtroom decisions as well as for her hairstyle, clothing and her personal life. Many ultimately blamed her for Simpson's acquittal.

The feeling at the time was that ""Marcia Clark is a strident shrew bitch-person,"" actress Sarah Paulson tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross. Paulson portrays Clark in FX's The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story. While preparing for the role, she watched video footage of Clark during the Simpson trial and read her memoir. Later, she also met Clark in person.

""My impressions of her now, after portraying her, are incredibly, vastly different,"" Paulson says. ""I now hold her to be a very competent, complicated, strong, deep-thinking, quick-witted, quick-draw, wonderful creature.""

The People v. O.J. Simpson is co-produced Ryan Murphy, who also co-created the FX anthology series American Horror Story, which Paulson has appeared in for all five of its seasons.

Though the O.J. series has been gaining a lot of attention, Paulson says she's waiting until some of the buzz dies down before watching. ""I think it's the first time in my professional life I have felt a real swell of positive feeling about my work in something,"" she says. ""I'm trying to just enjoy that, because I know that if I watch it I'm going to start picking it apart, and I think it would be a nice treat for myself to give myself a minute of enjoyment to celebrate the work.""

Interview Highlights

On how much the truth matters when portraying real events in a television show

I think it's of paramount importance, and at the same time it is a television show and it is a dramatization. There is no way to know exactly what Marcia Clark was feeling ... and how she cries privately, and there are many, many things that cannot be known. ... I just sort of have to kind of get behind knowing that the bulk of it is all true, and the moments that cannot be known  except for by the people that were actually there and lived it  that's where the acting comes in and the clever writing, at least you hope. I think the whole thing in general  everything was incredibly well-vetted and all of that.

On how she prepared to play Clark

I read, watched and listened to any and everything I could get my hands on. The good news is there are copious amounts of videos on the Internet where I was able to watch a lot of her physical [mannerisms]  her carriage, the way she used her hands, the way she spoke, how she often tilted her head to one side, particularly in the courtroom when she was addressing the judge, the defense team or the jury. I read her book, I read [Christopher] Darden's book [In Contempt], I read [Jeffrey] Toobin's book [The Run of His Life], and of course I read our scripts, which was probably where I ended up holding most closely that stuff. ...

The more I read about her, the more I knew about her, the more I just wanted to get it right. That was my primary concern, was just to get it right  and by right I mean just for it to be authentic and truthful. I wasn't really looking at it as a way of trying to correct any perceptions or misconceptions about Marcia, I just wanted to try to do it in an honorable and a truthful way.

On why she wanted to meet Clark in person

I don't even know that I wanted to know anything specific, I just wanted to breathe the same air that she was breathing, in the same moment. I had so immersed myself in all things Marcia Rachel Clark that the idea that I could be sitting across from her ... I just kind of wanted to hug her. I wanted to look her in the eye and tell her that she didn't have to be fearful of the take that was going to be presented about her, given all that I knew she had endured.

I could've only imagined and anticipated that she was going to be terribly, terribly anxious about having to relive this experience that was a great trauma for her. She never went back into the courtroom to prosecute a case after this trial and she had won 19 out of 20 prior to this case, so it was obviously a great passion of hers and it was stolen from her. I don't know that I took anything away from it or expected anything other than I just wanted to be in her orbit.

On the scrutiny she has encountered over her appearance, which helped her relate to the scrutiny Clark faced during the trial

I have naturally brown hair and every time I've been asked to be a leading lady on television or in a movie I have often been asked to make my hair blonde. And that is a sort of a weird slippery slope where you start to go, ""Gosh ... if my job on this particular program is supposed to be alluring or charming, thought of as a sexual creature, I have to have blonde hair? What does it mean that I don't actually have blonde hair? Does it mean that I am not any of those things without it?""

On playing conjoined twins on American Horror Story

Essentially, it was all done on a green screen and I would come in in the morning and prerecord my dialogue, because often the twins were speaking telepathically to one another and I wanted to be able to hear my own voice in my head. So I would record it and then wear an earwig so that I could talk to myself. I didn't want to have another actress off camera reading that didn't sound like me and didn't sound like my twin.

i toggle caption FX FX

It was a lot of lonely work, where I would have to look at a piece of tape and imagine my own head there. I never was able to look in anyone else's eyes to play a scene with myself. ... It was incredibly challenging and very, very technical. And everyone who ever did a scene with me on that season of Horror Story was always bemoaning the fact that they had to work with me because it meant their day was infinitely longer because it was just take after take, and we essentially had to do everything twice.

On making news after she kissed then-girlfriend Cherry Jones at the 2005 Tony Awards

I think I was a bit naive, actually, as to what it would mean. I was just doing what was instinctual to me, which was to congratulate and kiss the person whom I loved and who had just won a very fancy acting prize. It would've been strange for me to what, I don't know, pat her on the head, pat her on the shoulder, and I just did what it occurred to me to do. But I was very quickly made aware of it being a bit of a news [story] because I got a phone call from my publicist saying, ""Why did you do that?"" She's no longer my publicist, by the way. ...

I remember feeling like I was getting my hand slapped, that I had done something wrong, and I didn't feel very comfortable with that.

On whether she worries that being, as she puts it, sexually ""fluid"" affects the kinds of roles she gets

I wonder sometimes if being in the Ryan Murphy world  in that I get to play so many different types of characters within that one TV show  that there really isn't time to sort of typecast me as one particular kind of thing. I'm not a sex symbol, I'm not ... your typical movie star. And so I wonder if I've been sort of protected from having to worry about it preventing me from working in a way, because the public doesn't really have a particular attachment to me being one type of thing.

On whether society has become more accepting of fluid sexual orientation

The politicization of it is complicated for me, because I only know what to do according to what I feel and I only want to be governed by that. I try not to make any choices across the board that are dictated to me by someone else's idea of what [my sexuality] should be. So I do hope that the idea of somebody being fluid is no longer a covert or a euphemism for ""Oh, gay, just don't want to say it."" Because for me, I have been with men and I have been with women, and I don't know what lies ahead, and I don't want to be stuck with some kind of label that then makes me then a traitor to my people if I make a different choice. I want the freedom  my own personal freedom  to decide that as I see fit.

On her current relationship with actress Holland Taylor, who is about 30 years older

There is a very significant age difference. And when you love a person, the idea of losing them is terrifying, to put it mildly. So I have thought about it. But Holland actually put the best spin on it and said what I think was a very funny thing. ... We were at a dinner party and we were newly out and about as a couple, and a mutual friend of ours said, ""Oh, Holland, I'm so pleased for you. I'm so happy, this is so great, you and Sarah."" And Holland said, ""Yeah, I know. Look, if she dies, she dies."" It was so disarming. And Holland's point being: Yes, on paper, it looks like one thing, but anything can happen and you just don't know.",[]
npr.org,2016-03-10 00:00:00,How Best To Test For Zika Virus? : Shots,[],"How Best To Test For Zika Virus?

i toggle caption Arnulfo Franco/AP Arnulfo Franco/AP

Let's say you're a pregnant woman who recently traveled to Latin America or the Caribbean. You got a little sick shortly after the trip, with some combination of mild fever, rash, joint pain and conjunctivitis. The big question now is: Did you have Zika virus? And, if so, is your fetus still healthy?

""Probably every day, patients come in questioning whether or not they would qualify for testing,"" says Dr. Christine Curry, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Miami, and Jackson Memorial Hospital.

A preliminary study in Brazil makes a strong case for the link between Zika virus infection during pregnancy and a number of birth defects, including microcephaly. The infection has been associated with a range of outcomes in another study of nine U.S. women who caught the virus while traveling to regions where Zika is prevalent.

If a patient has a particular travel history, Curry sends a sample of the woman's blood to a lab for analysis. But it can take awhile for test results to come back, Curry says, and the waiting can be really stressful, especially for patients in the middle of a pregnancy.

""They're trying to decide what to do with the pregnancy, given so many unknowns,"" she says. ""The difference between two and four weeks can be the difference between being able to end a pregnancy and not.""

There's another problem: Some tests aren't very reliable, so patients sometimes have to go through multiple rounds to confirm whether they had Zika. That puts Curry in a tricky situation when she's counseling patients.

""It involves saying 'I don't know' and 'no one knows' over and over again,"" she says.

Until recently, most samples of fluids from patients had to be sent to Atlanta for testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now, about 30 local public health labs are gearing up to do the analysis themselves, including the District of Columbia's department of forensic sciences, where Cleveland Weeden works as a medical technologist.

Most days, Weeden says, he feels like an athlete stuck on the bench. Outbreaks are exciting, in a way, because he finally gets to put his expertise and skills to work.

""We're the bench,"" Weeden says. ""We get called into action when something goes on in the city.""

A refrigerator behind Weeden holds plastic baggies with tubes of blood and urine from patients in the area. As of this week, his job is to test all these samples for Zika virus.

Weeden expects to get the results to patients within three days, rather than four weeks. He's running a procedure called RT-PCR  or Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction. The CDC has produced about 375,000 kits that can perform this test. It looks for pieces of the virus' genetic material and answers ""yes"" or ""no"" to the question: ""Is there virus in this person's blood?""

Weeden says the test is pretty straightforward  except for one thing.

""From the time the person is bitten [by an infected mosquito] to the time they get to the doctor, no more than five to seven days can pass for us to [be able to] pick it up on PCR,"" he says.

That means that if PCR is to work, doctors have to collect patients' blood within a week of the first signs of a fever and rash. The virus hangs around a little longer in urine, so doctors would have a slightly longer window of time  about two weeks  to collect those samples. But there's an extra complication, Curry says: Most patients don't rush to the doctor when their illness is mild.

""If someone had virus in their blood three weeks ago and they're now cleared, the PCR's not going to tell you that,"" she says. In that case, a negative result could mean either that the person never had Zika, or that their body had already cleared it from their system by the time they got tested.

That's why labs like Weeden's are trying to get hold of another kind of test that the CDC developed, which goes by yet another bulky acronym  the Zika MAC-ELISA. This test looks for a protein in a person's blood  a specific type of antibody  that shows what foreign things the body has fought off recently.

The Zika MAC-ELISA is widely seen as the best test available, right now, because it works over a longer time span than the first option. It's also faster and cheaper than another more definitive test, and requires less specialized training to perform. According to the CDC, Zika antibodies appear in the blood ""starting 4 to 5 days after the start of illness and last for up to 12 weeks,"" or even longer in some people.

The CDC has produced about 100,000 of these test kits, and is offering them free to qualified labs. But there's one drawback: The test sometimes tells people they had Zika when they didn't.

An ideal test, all agree, would be specific to this particular virus and give a faster turnaround time  eliminating the need for the manpower, money and time required to go through the current layers of testing.

It's not just pregnant women who would benefit from a better test  so would patients who need blood transfusions in places like Puerto Rico, where health officials have been worried that patients might accidentally get Zika during transfusions with infected blood. So the officials have stopped accepting local donations and, instead, are now getting blood shipped in from the continental U.S.

The third, more definitive, test is called PRNT, or the plaque-reduction neutralization test. Because PRNT is expensive and takes at least a week longer to do than the Zika MAC-ELISA, the ELISA test is widely considered the more practical option in many cases.

""And herein lies where science needs to innovate a bit,"" says Ted Pierson, a virologist and senior investigator at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

Sometime in December, Pierson and colleagues in his molecular virology lab dropped their work on dengue virus so they could press the pedal to the metal on Zika. Pierson's work doesn't focus on pregnant women or blood transfusions.

""I am focused on amino acids, hydroxyls and phosphates,"" he explains. His team is trying to figure out how to make a better version of the antibody test  the Zika MAC-ELISA test the CDC is distributing to labs.

""The problem here is actually quite simple,"" Pierson explains. Viruses in the same family  in Zika's case, the flaviviruses  can look similar on the outside, and the antibodies the human immune system uses to fight them can also be similar.

So, if a person had been infected sometime along the way with another mosquito-borne virus in that family, like dengue or West Nile  or even if they simply had been vaccinated against yellow fever  they could test positive in a Zika antibody test.

""It's a good example of where the devil is in the details,"" Pierson says, and those details are what he and his colleagues are delving into now.

""What we, as a field, need to do is develop antigens that allow us to distinguish between the antibodies specific to Zika, versus those for other flaviviruses,"" he says.

The group is essentially stripping down the virus to figure out what is unique to Zika  what distinguishes it from related viruses. The researchers are particularly interested in proteins, like the ""fusion loop,"" that lie on top of the virus and help it enter a human cell. Once those unique parts are identified, it might be possible to create a more specific test that has much lower odds of triggering false positives.

That could take days to figure out  or months, Pierson says.

""You just can't predict,"" he says. ""This is science. We just have to do the experiments.""

In the meantime, people across the country who have jobs like Cleveland Weeden's will be working long days.

""You get physically tired,"" Weeden admits. ""We're not robots. Your hands cramp up after you pipette so much. But that's what we're here for. We're public health scientists.""

As the weather warms and mosquitoes start flying around, these scientists will keep on testing with  they hope  better and better tools.",[]

For the second time in as many days, Go champion Lee Sedol fished out one of the playing stones he'd captured from his opponent and placed it back on the board, admitting defeat against the computer program AlphaGo, which now has a 2-0 lead in their best-of-five series.

Lee and AlphaGo will now take a one-day break before continuing their match Saturday. Lee must win the next three games in order to win.

""Yesterday I was surprised, but today, more than that, I'm quite speechless,"" Lee said after the match, according to Go Game Guru. Lee, a multiple winner of world titles, then added, ""... there was not a moment in time where I felt that I was leading the game.""

When asked later about AlphaGo's weaknesses in the board game in which players compete for territory, Sedol answered that he had yet to find any.

YouTube

This game lacked some of the hard-hitting exchanges of the first, with several analysts agreeing that in Round 2, Lee took a more cautious approach while AlphaGo showed more creativity than on Wednesday. Both sides used some of their allotted overtime, after going through their two-hour periods in the second game, a contest that lasted for 211 moves, compared with 186 in Game 1.

At one point, an unusual decision by AlphaGo, to place a stone near one of Lee's white pieces where little action seemed to be taking place, ""made human champion Lee leave his seat to take a break, or likely to pull himself together after the unconventional move,"" the Korea Herald reports.

Michael Redmond, an elite Go player who's commenting on the games for the Google DeepMind channel on YouTube, said:

""I was impressed with AlphaGo's play. There was a great beauty to the opening. Based on what I had seen from its other games, AlphaGo was always strong in the end and middle game, but that was extended to the beginning game this time. It was a beautiful, innovative game.""

The challenge between Lee and AlphaGo carries a prize of around $1 million, and it has spurred interest in Go, a game that was developed in China centuries ago and is now played by tens of millions of people.

Here's how the American Go Association describes the philosophy behind the game, which has fewer rules than chess but has many more potential variations for how pieces are arranged on the board:

""There is no simple procedure to turn a clear lead into a victory  only continued good play. The game rewards patience and balance over aggression and greed; the balance of influence and territory may shift many times in the course of a game, and a strong player must be prepared to be flexible but resolute. Go thinking seems more lateral than linear, less dependent on logical deduction, and more reliant on a 'feel' for the stones, a 'sense' of shape, a gestalt perception of the game.""

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis, whose company created AlphaGo, called Thursday's game ""excruciatingly nerve-wracking""  and he also said that more than 100 million people worldwide had watched the first match online.

i toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images

The fight to improve wages for Florida's tomato pickers hit the national stage over the past week, as part of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.

Last Saturday, Vermont Democrat Bernie Sanders' campaign released a five-minute documentary highlighting the struggles  and successes  of tomato pickers in Immokalee, Fla. As Barry Estabrook documented in his 2011 book Tomatoland, these workers faced poverty wages and were subjected to pesticide-laden fields, abusive bosses and slave-like working conditions.

YouTube

As we've reported, over the past half-decade, conditions have been improving for these workers, thanks to a combination of measures, including a premium of a penny-per-pound that corporate buyers like Wal-Mart and Whole Foods pay to growers.

The video from the Sanders campaign notes that the senator held hearings on the matter back in 2008, before efforts to improve the workers' lot had gained much traction. As the narrator, an unnamed female tomato worker originally from Mexico, says in the video, not many politicians visited Immokalee, but Sanders was there to support their fight.

And those hearings became the focus of a testy exchange between Sanders and Hillary Clinton at last night's debate in Miami. Clinton accused Sanders of siding with ""Minute Men"" and Republicans who voted against a 2007 immigration overhaul bill that, among other things, would have expanded the guest worker visa program.

That program would have let foreign workers in for two years at a time, but critics argued that it offered very few protections for workers. Sanders has said he opposed the bill because it would have left immigrant workers more vulnerable to exploitation and would have ultimately depressed wages for Americans, too.

At the Miami debate, Sanders countered Clinton's criticism by pointing to the 2008 hearings he held on the plight of the Immokalee workers. ""And the result of that hearing,"" Sanders said, ""and the work that many, many people did was to significantly improve the wages and working conditions of those workers.""",[]

When it's time for medical care, where do you go? The doctor's office? An urgent care clinic? Or the nearest hospital?

As many as 1 in 3 Americans sought care in an ER in the past two years, according to a recent poll by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. That relatively high frequency may be a matter of convenience, even though many in the poll also report frustration with the cost and quality of care they received in an ER.

Skipper Beck, for instance, who lives in Holiday, Fla., near Tampa, wasn't crazy about the care he got. As he remembers it, he was having a great Friday, playing beach football on Florida's Gulf Coast, when he hurt himself.

""I hit someone a little too hard, a little bit too low,"" says Beck, who is 36 years old.

By that evening, Beck couldn't rotate his shoulder. It was painful to lift any weight, he says. He thought maybe he'd dislocated the shoulder, fractured it, or maybe torn something. So, late that night, he headed to the ER.

The medical staff ran tests, put him in a sling and sent him on his way  4 1/2 hours later. ""Honesty I felt like cattle,"" he says. ""Kind of 'get me in, get me out.' ""

Beck thinks the cost for his ER visit was unreasonable, and he felt like the doctors didn't care about him. In fact, about a quarter of the people NPR polled in Florida say the ER care they got was fair or poor, and only a third say it was excellent.

The relatively high cost and no-frills treatment in traditional emergency departments may be because most ERs are designed to treat life or death emergencies  gunshots, a heart attack, a bad car accident.

But 47 percent of recent patients in the U.S. say they seek care in an ER for non-urgent reasons. They go because it's convenient, says, Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Many (28 percent) say their main reason for choosing an ER for treatment, instead of a doctor's office, urgent care facility or community health clinic was because the other facilities weren't open, or the poll respondent couldn't get an appointment. About 3 percent nationally  and 8 percent in Florida  say they mainly chose an ER for treatment because the other facilities were too far away.

""Almost a third of people in Florida have used an ER in the last two years,"" Blendon says.

Many people assume that the only patients who choose an ER for care that's not an emergency are poor and uninsured, and don't have a regular doctor. But Blendon says that's an oversimplification: In fact, more than 80 percent of Floridians polled who used an ER are covered by health insurance.

What can be done to shift more of the non-urgent cases out of the ER?

i toggle caption Courtesy of Delilah Torres Courtesy of Delilah Torres

It would help, Blendon says, if the medical world were more responsive to the problem. For instance, more community doctors could hold some office hours on evenings or weekends, so they could potentially see a patient like Skipper Beck late on a Friday, or see patients on short notice when they're sick.

""I'm hoping we'll change a bit of the discussion,"" he says. ""You have to have a place to go, and the hours have to reflect the life of people.""

But ERs are important to hospital revenue, and people seek help there for many reasons. So some hospitals are trying to make the ER experience more convenient for patients. Some emergency departments now allow patients to schedule appointments, for instance. And others modify their care and facilities to attract a particular subset of the community  such as the parents of sick or hurt children.

Delilah Torres, whose 10-year-old son, Ryan, has Down syndrome, appreciates that sort of special attention to kids.

""There were many times, many times in the past when I waited before taking Ryan to the emergency room because I knew how stressful it is to sit at the waiting room for hours,"" she says.

A few weeks ago, Torres had a very different experience at Nemours Children's Hospital in Orlando, Fla. When she and her son arrived in the ER, she says, the staff brought Ryan into a special room, with soothing music and toys, and talked to his mother about what upsets him.

Torres says Ryan is strong, and four nurses are usually needed to draw blood from him, or put in an IV line.

""This time was the first time it actually only took two nurses to put a line in Ryan,"" she says.

The Nemours Children's Hospital, in central Florida, is just a few years old. Its waiting room is painted in bright colors, and has round, plushy cubby holes cut into the wall for fun seating for the kids. Free slushies are available in the ER.

Cara Harwell, a nurse practitioner there, points out a sign that says REACH: Respecting Each Awesome Child Here.

""We want the parents to self-identify that they have a child with autism or a similar condition, like a sensory processing disorder or a mental health disorder,"" Harwell says.

That friendly approach in the ER will help the hospital's ""patient satisfaction scores,"" she says. Funding is partly tied to performance in those rankings, and hospital officials are studying how it affects other aspects of care.

""Before we even put our hands on them, if we can know what the child likes and doesn't like, we can prevent them from becoming ... agitated [and from hurting] themselves or someone else,"" Harwell says. ""We can also reduce the use of sedatives or restraints.""

Of course, hospitals have yet another motivation to improve a patient's experience of the ER visit: A well-run emergency room can be profitable, and parents like Delilah Torres will drive 30 minutes past another hospital to get to one that better meets her needs.",[]

Five years after an earthquake and tsunami caused a series of meltdowns at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant in Japan, there are signs of progress. Many workers cleaning up the ruined plant no longer need to suit up in full respirators. Some nearby villages that were evacuated are open to residents.

But there are still plenty of problems.

""Fukushima Dai-ichi is a complicated clean-up site,"" says Dale Klein, a former chairman of the U.S Nuclear Regulatory Commission who now consults for the Tokyo Electric Power Company, or TEPCO, which owns the plant.

A map made by the volunteer organization Safecast indicates that radiation levels remain elevated in the region around Fukushima Dai-ichi. In areas that are orange, yellow or white, levels are high and an evacuation order remains in place. Areas in pink and purple are safe to live in, provided extensive decontamination efforts are effective. Blue denotes areas where radiation is at natural levels.

Perhaps the biggest problem is water, Klein says. Groundwater from nearby mountains constantly seeps through the ruined building before spilling into the ocean. TEPCO has tried a number of different approaches (including a massive underground ice wall) to try and slow the incursion, but so far efforts to stop it have been only partially successful.

Instead, the company must send the groundwater through a complex filtration system that removes radioactivity. The system is effective at removing some of the most dangerous elements, but one isotope of hydrogen, called tritium, can't be removed because it's literally embedded in the H 2 O of the water molecules.

""Tritium is part of the water itself, so how do you filter water out of water?"" Klein says.

The best solution might be to dilute the radioactive groundwater and then release it into the ocean. But fishermen and the public would have to be convinced. For now, nearly a million tons of water is being stored all over the site.

""There are about a thousand containers, steel containers that hold this water,"" he says.

i toggle caption Kimmimasa Mayama/AFP/Getty Images Kimmimasa Mayama/AFP/Getty Images

The land around the plant was also contaminated by the accident. Azby Brown is with the nonprofit organization Safecast, which independently monitors radiation levels in Fukushima prefecture. He says readings by Safecast and the government show that radiation levels in the region around the plant have fallen by roughly half.

""There's no question that the radiation levels have decreased compared to 2011,"" he says.

Some of that drop is due to the natural radioactive decay, but there has also been a huge cleanup effort. Workers across Fukushima have been scraping up contaminated topsoil and storing it in bags. And that's created its own problem, Brown says.

""There are now about 9 million bags of decontamination waste from all over the prefecture that are being consolidated into these vast fields with these pyramids of radioactive waste,"" he says.

Just like with the water, regulators aren't quite sure what to do with all that soil. Japan doesn't have a centralized radioactive waste dump to take it to.

In the longer term, the biggest issue will be what to do with the highly radioactive cores of the reactors themselves, each filled with melted uranium fuel. After the Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine, Soviet officials opted to pour concrete over the melted reactor core. But TEPCO's chief nuclear officer, Takafumi Anegawa, says Fukushima's fuel has got to be removed because the plant's presence on the coast poses a threat to the environment. ""This condition cannot continue for many years,"" he says.

toggle caption GAMMA/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images

Unfortunately, TEPCO doesn't really have any firm ideas about how to get the melted fuel out. ""So far, there's no specific clear solution,"" Anegawa says.

In fact, the company hasn't even been able to look inside to see what needs to be done. Anegawa says the radiation is so intense that it's fried the circuits of several robots sent in to investigate.

Dale Klein, the safety consultant, thinks that eventually robots will be used to cut up the molten cores of the reactors and seal them inside concrete containers. But he says it's not going to happen overnight.

""This will be a several-decades process of cleanup,"" he says.

In other words, the Fukushima accident will be with the people of Japan for generations to come.",[]

""There was a wave, a renaissance in creative people moving to television, where suddenly longform, serial storytelling in an adult fashion became possible. And quite frankly, I think the only reason that a 24-year-old kid with no credits is the composer of Battlestar Galactica is because it was a television show. Guys doing films just weren't interested.""

In the decade since, McCreary has composed the music for such high-profile TV series as The Walking Dead, Black Sails, Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Outlander.

McCreary's career goes back to a chance encounter when he was a junior in high school. The local rotary club in Bellingham, Wash. named him ""student of the month,"" and at the awards luncheon it came up that he was interested in film music. After the event, a man named Joe Coons came up to him and told him he had a friend in the business.

""And I thought, 'All right, whatever, man,'"" McCreary recalls. ""And he says, 'Have you heard of Elmer Bernstein?' And my jaw hits the floor. I mean, this guy had written some of my favorite melodies, ever.""

The late Elmer Bernstein was one of the founding fathers of Hollywood film scoring, whose music helped define such classics as The Magnificent Seven and To Kill a Mockingbird.

""Elmer had a sailboat,"" McCreary says. ""Every summer he would take it up to Alaska and come back down, and he kept his boat in Bellingham Harbor. Joe Coons ran the local boat club. That's how I met Elmer Bernstein. And I ended up working for Elmer for seven to 10 years.""

McCreary learned some crucial lessons from Bernstein  including to always start a film with a unique sound.

""He always said that you have anywhere from two to 10 seconds to get the audience's attention,"" he says, ""before they become distracted by the story, the titles, the narrative, the acting.""

And, McCreary says, Bernstein was good at following his own rules. ""To Kill a Mockingbird starts with this very childlike piano that could be played with one finger,"" he explains. ""Walk on the Wild Side starts with a triangle solo.""

YouTube

Bernstein himself provided another example when he spoke to Fresh Air in 1991, about the exodus scene in Cecil B. DeMille's epic The Ten Commandments.

""When we realized that a shofar was going to be seen on the screen, we had to find somebody to play the shofar,"" Bernstein said. ""And for those who don't know, the shofar is a very ancient instrument made out of a ram's horn. Well, who plays shofars, of course? Rabbis. Because it's still used in Jewish ceremonies. We must have had, oh, I guess 20 or 30 rabbis on the scoring stage.""

McCreary wanted to draw on that lesson when he got the assignment to score 10 Cloverfield Lane.

""I wrote a theme for the main character, and I had it played on a Middle Eastern instrument called the yayl tambur,"" he says. ""And the next day I went into Bad Robot to play it for the director, Dan Trachtenberg, and producer J.J. Abrams. And the lights went down, those stars from the Paramount logo start floating in, and the yayl tambur starts playing.""

It turns out, Bernstein's advice paid off.

""J.J. turns to me and goes, 'That's really cool! What is that?'"" McCreary says. ""And I smiled, because I thought, 'Elmer was totally right.'""

It turns out 10 Cloverfield Lane's director Dan Trachtenberg was a huge fan of McCreary's music for Battlestar Galactica. Trachtenberg says there are many scores that, while he appreciates for what they do for a movie, he wouldn't necessarily want to listen to. But McCreary's work is different.

""He wrote things that I really just liked the sound of,"" he says. ""And I was excited to work with him, knowing that what I would get would be something that I would really find moving and beautiful to listen to.""

McCreary says he feels lucky to be writing music for a living. Finding joy in his work is something else Elmer Bernstein taught him.

""Elmer showed me that it was possible to succeed in art and in an industry and in a business, and still have a family, still have happiness, still take time for yourself,"" he says. ""All the other tricks of the trade and business that I picked up over the last 10 years have been great, but I feel like my life was set on the right path when I crossed paths with him.""",[]

i Pedro Armestre/AFP/Getty Images Pedro Armestre/AFP/Getty Images

Plastic makes great food packaging. It's waterproof and flexible. And best of all, it's impervious to all known bacteria  until now. Researchers have found a bacterium in the debris fields around a recycling plant in Japan that can feed off a common type of plastic used in clothing, plastic bottles and food packaging.

The bacterium is a new species called Ideonella sakaiensis, named for the Japanese city Sakai where it was found growing on plastic debris made from a type of plastic called PET or polyethylene terephthalate. ""It's the most unique thing. This bacterium can degrade PET and then make their body from PET,"" says Shosuke Yoshida, a microbiologist at Kyoto University and lead author on the study published in Science on Thursday.

Most plastics are insurmountable obstacles for microbes because plastics are large chains of repeating molecules called polymers. The entire chain is far larger than the individual microbe. ""So the organism can't take it inside the cell to metabolize it,"" says John Coates, a microbiologist at the University of California, Berkeley who was not involved with the work. Imagine a baby trying to eat an enormous pizza from the middle. It can't do it. The pie is too big.

But Ideonella sakaiensis, which we here at NPR have decided to call ""the polymer chomper,"" has two enzymes that can slice and dice the plastic polymer into smaller pieces. In other words, the baby gets a pizza cutter. The bacterium can then take the pieces and eat them, eventually converting the plastic into carbon dioxide and water.

After Yoshida and his colleagues isolated the polymer chomper, they were able to watch it disintegrate a plastic film in about six weeks. It would be great if we could culture the bacteria, spray landfills down with them and let them deal with our mountains of plastic refuse. But alas, that may never happen. ""It grows very fast,"" Yoshida explains, ""but it's likely not so useful in the field"" because it chomps very slowly.

And if getting rid of our plastic waste were so easy, Coates notes, the bacterium would likely have already been found in landfills and anywhere you find mounds of plastic waste.

But with more research, Coates thinks that the bacterium might be engineered for such a purpose. ""It's certainly a move in the right direction. Having an organism that seems to be capable of biodegrading these components directly will help us develop a bioremediation technology,"" he says. Certain species of fungi have been found to be able to degrade plastics before  though none have been converted to landfill-munching purposes. The polymer chomper offers new hope, Coates says, because bacteria are easier to work with and engineer.

That doesn't mean we'll ever be able to toss our plastic without care. Recycling will likely remain a better option anyway, Coates adds. ""Environmentally, I would prefer recycling if it can be optimized and improved,"" he says. Biodegrading materials still releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which would contribute to global warming. But in cases where recycling is not feasible, he says maybe this little bacterium could one day prove a useful alternative.",[]

i toggle caption David Gilkey/NPR David Gilkey/NPR

Last month, I visited a displaced person's camp in South Sudan and met a woman who said she'd spent almost a year hiding in a swamp. She spent her days submerged, her head just above water. At night she'd emerge to search for food.

She's one of the hundreds of thousands of people who have fled their homes over the last 2 years to escape that country's brutal civil war. It's hard to imagine that so many people would give up their worldly goods and flee in to the bush. A new report from Amnesty International helps explain why.

The report, issued today, looks at one atrocity that not only claimed dozens of lives but sowed fear in the living left behind.

Amnesty International says that in October of 2015, government soldiers rounded up more than 60 men and boys in Leer, a town in the northern Unity state, locked them in a shipping container until they suffocated, then dumped their bodies in a nearby field. They were accused of supporting the opposition rebels.

""Witnesses described to us how the men were detained. How they were forced in to this container,"" says Lama Fakih, a crisis adviser with Amnesty International, who spent two weeks last month in South Sudan investigating the massacre. Amnesty International interviewed 42 people, she says, who saw parts of the incident. ""Some [of the witnesses] were just outside the container and could hear the detainees banging on the sides of the container, screaming.""

i toggle caption Courtesy of Amnesty International Courtesy of Amnesty International

According to the report, soldiers opened the container to remove the bodies of some of the men who'd suffocated to death but then locked the doors again with the rest of the people inside. After 24 hours all but one of the detainees were dead.

This incident is significant for several reasons. First, Amnesty International is calling it a war crime by the Sudanese government against its own people. Second, it occurred 2 months after the warring parties  the forces of South Sudanese president Salva Kiir and troops led by his former vice-president Reik Machar  signed a peace accord. An international commission charged with monitoring that ceasefire also documented reports of the shipping container killing in a confidential memo dated December 18, 2015. Some details in that memo are slightly different from what AI found but the main facts are strikingly similar.

The ceasefire commission's report said, ""Between 20 and 22 October 2015 a group of Government Forces were involved in some sort of operation in Leer County, during which cattle were seized and about 50 people (reports vary between 53 and 60) were rounded up and put in a shipping container in Leer. The container is in the compound used by Government Forces as a headquarters. A large number of those people suffocated. Their bodies were taken and thrown into the bush along the Gandor road.""

The ""compound"" where this happened was a church.

Government troops had commandeered the grounds of the Comboni Catholic Church in Leer after the clergy had fled. The soldiers were using the church grounds as a base.

""Unsubstantiated reports suggest that the few [detainees] who survived were killed,"" the ceasefire commission memo adds. ""There are further reports that the only survivor was an eight-year-old boy.""

Amnesty International heard that there was a lone boy who survived but puts his age at 12. One of the unnamed witnesses in the AI report says that when the shipping container was finally opened there was a pile of bodies 3 feet high. ""What we saw was tragic ... the container was full of people, they had fallen over one another and on to the floor,"" she's quoted as saying.

This massacre is being blamed on government forces but reports from the African Union, Human Rights Watch and others say both sides in this civil war have committed crimes against humanity including raping women, castrating child soldiers, killing civilians and even allegedly forcing captives to drink human blood.

""Sadly this is one horrific experience in a long litany of violations that we have documented being perpetrated by government forces or allied militias against the civilian population,"" says Amnesty International's Lama Fakih about the shipping container incident. ""And again the abuses we have documented took place after the signing of the peace agreement.""

i toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP

The FCC has unveiled a proposal that would restrict Internet providers' ability to share the information they collect about what their customers do online with advertisers and other third parties.

If adopted, these would be the first privacy rules for Internet service providers, resulting largely from last year's net neutrality regulations that expanded the Federal Communications Commission's oversight authority over the industry. (Those rules are currently pending in court.)

Thursday's unveiling of the proposal from Chairman Tom Wheeler is just a first step: The FCC is expected to vote to formally propose this plan on March 31, soliciting public comments on a variety of questions about how the rules should work before the final version gets drafted.

The key elements of Wheeler's proposal include a requirement that broadband providers such as Comcast, Verizon or T-Mobile clearly disclose what data they collect on you  for instance, it could be browsing history, use of apps or location  and how they shared that collected data with other companies for marketing or other purposes.

In some instances, subscribers would be asked to opt in or they'd be given a choice to opt out, depending on how the information is used. (Re/code has a helpful breakdown of the details.) The proposal also has provisions for better security of the information traveling through ISPs' networks.

Wheeler wrote in a Huffington Post op-ed that ISPs should be held to the same privacy standard as telephone companies:

""Your ISP handles all of your network traffic. That means it has a broad view of all of your unencrypted online activity  when you are online, the websites you visit, and the apps you use. If you have a mobile device, your provider can track your physical location throughout the day in real time. Even when data is encrypted, your broadband provider can piece together significant amounts of information about you  including private information such as a chronic medical condition or financial problems  based on your online activity. ""The information collected by the phone company about your telephone usage has long been protected information. Regulations of the (FCC) limit your phone company's ability to repurpose and resell what it learns about your phone activity. ""The same should be true for information collected by your ISP.""

Telecom companies are resisting the FCC's push to regulate their privacy practices, arguing that this puts them on unequal footing compared with websites and web services such as Google that also collect a lot of information about people's digital tracks. As The New York Times points out, those companies are overseen by another agency:

""The regulations, if approved, would put broadband providers under stronger privacy oversight than Internet companies like Google and Facebook. Those companies are monitored by the Federal Trade Commission, whose ability to create specific privacy rules is limited. ""Many privacy advocates have pushed for a greater role by other agencies because the F.T.C. cannot create rules for online privacy and can only monitor data collection practices as an enforcement agency.""

AT&T's Bob Quinn, senior vice president of federal regulatory affairs, said in a blog post this week that Internet providers ""do not currently live in a 'regulatory-free zone' when it comes to privacy,"" but one guided by the FTC's regime, which prohibits deceptive and unfair trade practices:",[]

i toggle caption Aaron Epstein/Courtesy of Roadside Attractions Aaron Epstein/Courtesy of Roadside Attractions

The eccentric middle-aged cat lady has met the vintage-loving hipsters. Hello, My Name Is Doris stars Sally Field as a woman whose attraction to a much younger man leads her on a journey into young-adult circles, where she is celebrated for her ""unique style""  at least until someone has the guts to tell her what ironic appreciation means.

Doris is a deeply sympathetic character, a Staten Island native who has lived in her mother's house for her entire adult life. When her mom dies, she's cast adrift, unable to throw out anything in the cluttered home despite the incessant pleadings of family and friends. We feel Doris' pain simply because Field is one of the most gifted actors working, capable of being flighty and nervy and deeply sad all at the same moment. She's in every scene and carries the film through a weak script that often sells her character's intelligence far short.

At work, where Doris has clung to her bottom-rung accounting job even as 20-somethings have replaced all her colleagues, she falls for the new art director, a young catch played by Max Greenfield. He's required to be quite a bit more subdued here than in his regular gig as New Girl's Schmidt, but still wrangles in a few funny lines. The schoolgirl crush seems destined to end before it begins, but Doris gets sneaky and ""catfishes"" her target to model herself after his interests. ""Find someone who looks like they have a master's degree,"" she instructs her friend's granddaughter as she constructs her fake Facebook profile. Suddenly Doris is sporting hip neon threads and jamming to electronic dance bands. (The film's indie-band parody, ""Baby Goya and the Nuclear Winters,"" is only one step removed from real-life indie band Margot & the Nuclear So and So's.)

Michael Showalter, who directed, adapted Doris from a short film by New York University student Laura Terruso (Showalter teaches at the school). Showalter is best known for his roles in sketch comedy franchises like The State, Stella and Wet Hot American Summer, where he constantly mocked the tropes of film and TV while honing a tone so arch it was like having his elbow perpetually pressed into your side. He did the same in The Baxter, his 2005 directorial debut. Seeing him attempt something so sincere, so rooted in human behavior instead of screwball goofs, makes for a strange yet welcome bit of cognitive dissonance.

In Doris, Showalter embraces many of the same middlebrow story beats he used to see himself transcending. The protagonist may be a couple of decades older than normal, a fact that is this film's main selling point as an object of representational progress, but there's still a misunderstanding at a party, a mistaken identity and a cluttered house symbolizing an unkempt state of mind. Doris even has a few moments of pathos, including a heartbreaking monologue that allows Field to play some real emotion. But it's not entirely a sapfest, as there are also great comedy ringers in the margins, including Kumail Nanjiani and Natasha Lyonne as co-workers and Tyne Daly as Doris' best friend. Daly's lived-in sass cuts through the smirking young people, as when she snaps at Doris, ""You're just the weird old lady in the funny clothes to them.""

In its probing of the generation gap that defines hipness, Doris bears similarities to Noah Baumbach's smart 2015 comedy While We're Young, though its societal critiques are not as clever nor its story as compelling. Still, through it all, Field is one weird old lady who refuses to be pinned down.",[]

i toggle caption Michele K. Short/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures Michele K. Short/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures

[This is a film it's very hard to talk about at all without spoiling at least the premise and the basic setup, but this review does its level best not to go beyond that point.]

""What does this have to do with Cloverfield?""

Putting that question out of your mind during 10 Cloverfield Lane is ignoring the elephant in the room, but everything about the film, from its out-of-the-blue viral campaign to its thrilling commitment to misdirection, makes it possible. Some connections eventually emerge, as might be expected from one of producer J.J. Abrams' puzzlebox narratives, but 10 Cloverfield Lane is not another found-footage War of the Worlds scenario. And it doesn't take place in the wide-open spaces of a city under siege, either. For the longest time, it appears that the Cloverfield franchise is united mainly by the aesthetic principle of offscreen space  not the catchiest hook, but an enormously effective one.

The obvious reason the two films connect so thinly is that 10 Cloverfield Lane wasn't originally conceived as a sort-of sequel, but retrofitted like the chainsaw Bruce Campbell attaches to his arm in Evil Dead II. In sharp contrast to the shaky-cam of Cloverfield, first-time director Dan Trachtenberg gives the opening scenes a classic Hitchcockian quality, nodding specifically to Janet Leigh's dash out of town in Psycho and laying on a muscular score (by Bear McCreary) in homage to Bernard Herrmann. Also like Hitchcock, the story takes a decisive turn once a car peels off the road.

That car belongs to Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a Louisiana woman who's first shown hastily packing her things in a suitcase and a box, and rushing out of her apartment, leaving her wedding ring behind. Shortly after an evening pitstop for fuel, Michelle gets in a car accident that sends her careening down an embankment. When she awakens, she finds herself hooked to an IV drip in an unadorned cement bunker with her leg handcuffed to a pipe. Before she can improvise her way out of trouble, her captor comes thundering through the door. His name is Howard (John Goodman), he explains, and contrary to appearances, he saved Michelle from the wreck and is currently protecting her from threats unknown.

There's reason to believe he's right. Howard claims that after the accident, there was a chemical attack that rendered the air unbreathable, and being the cheerful paranoiac he is, he'd built an underground shelter for just such an occasion. Along with a third resident named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), the two of them have enough supplies to wait out the apocalypse for a year or two, when the toxicity has presumably passed. Howard is a disturbing guy who lords over Michelle and Emmett like a belligerent father, but any attempt to escape risks the likelihood of instant death the moment they peek their heads above ground.

All this may sound like the set-up to an M. Night Shyamalan twist, and certainly 10 Cloverfield Lane does have the obligation to pay off its Twilight Zone premise. But Trachtenberg and his screenwriters, Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken, take advantage of the shelter's tight quarters, which contribute to the expected pressure-cooker atmosphere of suspicion and hostility but also open up the punch-drunk comedy of people going mad with boredom. Howard may be a controlling monster, but he's got a kick-ass jukebox and he's always up for board games or late-night viewings of Pretty In Pink on VHS. (Just be sure to compliment him on his spaghetti.)

Goodman's ability to vacillate between regular-guy jocularity and Biblical fury has made him a Coen brothers favorite since Barton Fink, and his performance helps modulate the film's stomach-clenching tonal shifts. But Winstead is every bit as good as the frightened yet resourceful heroine, who has to make difficult decisions about if, when, and how to act, and validate the serpentine logic of the script.

i toggle caption Keith Bernstein/Courtesy of Bleecker Street Keith Bernstein/Courtesy of Bleecker Street

In A War, a Danish commander whose troops are under attack by the Taliban calls in an air strike, and later has to answer for it in a courtroom. Eye in the Sky mashes those two narratives together. While a drone pilot in Nevada prepares to hit al-Shabaab terrorists in Nairobi, the morality of this potential action is debated by politicos in London.

The movie is both provocative and fairly gripping, if not altogether convincing. As directed by Gavin Hood, a South African whose Rendition took a broader and more melodramatic look at Western responses to extremist violence, Eye in the Sky neatly contrasts urgency and hesitation, and pits near-certainty against reasonable doubt.

This is the structure provided by writer Guy Hibbert, whose script essentially interlaces a thriller with a courtroom drama. The story begins with a Muslim family in Kenya and a military officer in Britain. Col. Powell (Helen Mirren) has long tracked a U.K.-born woman who married a Somali man suspected of terrorism and converted to his brand of Islam. The family's young daughter, Alia (Aisha Tashow), is about to get in the colonel's way.

Powell and her small crew of technicians, no-nonsense except for their unnecessary camouflage uniforms, can't do the job alone. The American drone operator (Aaron Paul) and other U.S. military personnel are in the electronic loop. Their cooperation becomes essential after the colonel peeks inside a house via bird- and insect-mimicking drones that may be a bit cuter than their real-life equivalents. Powell determines that her targets are about to undertake a suicide bombing, so she wants to kill them first. Only the Yanks have the means to do that.

The process quickly gets lawyered up. There's an attorney to offer cautions at the base where Powell works, and British Lt. Gen. Benson (the late Alan Rickman) heads to a cabinet briefing room to consult with legalistic politicians. Soon, they've got the foreign secretary on the video-phone from Singapore. The stalling irritates Powell and Benson (and Rickman was a master of exasperation).

The talking heads are physically detached from the situation, but the British have a man on the ground in Kenya, Jama (Somalia-born Barkhad Abdi, who played the pirate leader in Captain Phillips). He's assigned to move Alia, who's selling loaves of bread, away from the house the British want to bomb. That turns out to be tricky, and so chubby-cheeked Alia becomes the human face of possible collateral damage.

All the live video provides an intimacy new to missile attacks. The Britons have seen in closeup the innocent girl they might slay. Still, they devote an implausible amount of time to discussing the quandary, and some moments of American reluctance seem even more unlikely. These scenes of ethical and political consideration work more as a filmed theater piece than as realistic cinema.

But as its engine the movie has the action in Kenya, where there's little talk, and all of it is pragmatic. People haggle over bread, unaware of the larger bargain being negotiated across three other continents.

Eye in the Sky  like Hood's previous film, Ender's Game  has lots of CGI and green-screen work. But this time the director employs special effects only to show things that could happen, and technology that really exists, in places that haven't quite caught up to the deadly implications. Those places would include, well, everywhere on Earth.",[]

i toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

The California Senate voted Thursday to raise the legal age to buy tobacco products from 18 to 21. The measure is part of a larger package of legislation aimed at cracking down on tobacco.

If Gov. Jerry Brown signs the bill, California will become the second state, after Hawaii, to raise the age limit for buying cigarettes and other tobacco products. More than 100 cities around the country, including New York and Boston, have already raised the age limit.

A week ago, the California Assembly approved the measure, which  in addition to raising the age limit  regulates electronic cigarettes the same as tobacco products, expands smoke-free areas, increases smoking bans and allows counties to levy higher taxes on cigarettes than the 87-cent per pack state tax. According to NPR member station KQED, the Assembly's vote came a few days after the San Francisco Board of Supervisors increased the age to buy tobacco products to 21.

California lawmakers passed the bill despite lobbying from tobacco interests, the Associated Press reports. The measure also faced opposition from many Republicans, who said the state should not be involved in policing peoples' personal choices.

""I don't smoke. I don't encourage my children to,"" said Republican Assemblyman Donald Wagner, according to KQED. ""But they're adults, and it's our job to treat our citizens as adults, not to nanny them.""

But proponents of the bill say raising the age to 21 moves legally purchased tobacco that much farther from younger kids.

""This will save the medical system in the outgoing years millions of dollars,"" said Democratic Assemblyman Jim Wood, according to KQED. ""It will save thousands of lives.""

As the AP reported, a 2015 study by the Institute of Medicine ""found that if the minimum legal age to buy tobacco were raised to 21 nationwide, tobacco use would drop by 12 percent by the time today's teens reached adulthood. In addition, there would be 223,000 fewer premature deaths and 50,000 fewer deaths from lung cancer.""",[]

i toggle caption Courtesy of Oscilloscope Laboratories Courtesy of Oscilloscope Laboratories

Chances are, if you've seen a Kelly Reichardt film, it would be Wendy and Lucy, a small, languorous, utterly heartbreaking 2008 drama with a big star, Michelle Williams, as a young homeless woman trying to make her way to the Pacific Northwest with her beloved dog. Wendy and Lucy is an art film with a delirious sense of place, but it's also a road movie, and far from Reichardt's first. One way or another, every extreme indie she makes pays sly, ardent homage to genre. In Old Joy, two former buddies take a camping trip through the Pacific Northwest in an effort to refresh a friendship gone stale. The pacing in Meek's Cutoff (also starring Williams) is so characteristically digressive, so little concerned with plot, you might miss the fact that you're watching a rather leisurely feminist Western.

Reichardt is, in the best sense, crafty that way, and it doesn't disparage any of her lovely mood pieces to say that in comparison, her 1994 feature debut, River of Grass  restored in vibrant color for a fresh release this week  moves like an express train. Not that it clips along exactly, even with a jazz soundtrack and frantic drum solos tracking a rumpled couple on the lam across the Florida Everglades, where Reichardt grew up. But before we get to a downbeat rampage across that landscape of dingy malls, scrappy palm trees and cheesy motels, meet Cozy (Lisa Bowman), a putative homemaker rotting away in a seedy Broward County suburb. Cozy has a sweet face and two babies with an indistinctly drawn husband  it would be stretching things to call the couple high-school sweethearts. But the mother-child bonding instinct is spectacularly missing from her makeup, and she spends her days dreaming of glamorous destinies in the performing arts.

The unpromising childhood that shaped Cozy plays out as black comedy with a mournful edge. In an unvarying monotone, she narrates her abandonment by a mother who fled when she was ten, leaving her to be raised by her father, Ryder, a drummer and crime scene detective like Reichardt's own father. Played in an extremely yellow suit by Dick Russell, whose cratered mug looks rather like the Grand Canyon, Ryder is forever losing his gun. The weapon ends up in the woefully incapable hands of Lee Ray Harold, a wastrel played with hilariously insufficient menace by the horror auteur Larry Fessenden, who also edited and co-produced River of Grass. Given the pervasive pauses for inertia and gross incompetence, you may not be shocked to hear that Cozy, Larry and the gun are fated to meet in a bar, that the gun will go off, that there may or may not be a murder, which may or may not be solved. For this Bonnie and Clyde, just getting on the road is a logistical nightmare.

River of Grass is very funny, but in a more somber key it also test-drives what will become Reichardt's specialty: the transformation of cheerless wastelands into backdrops for journeys of the parched soul. Her subsequent films are sadder, more freighted with the pain and alienation of an America that, one way or another, has put so many of its inhabitants out on the roadside. Reichardt invariably speaks for the dispossessed, and all her films must be seen. But River of Grass is her vital firstborn juiced by the fresh, untidy vitality of a newbie filmmaker doffing her cap to B-movies and the French New Wave. In that film she gives life's castaways the gift of merriment, and an ending that holds up half the sky.",[]

i toggle caption Courtesy of CelebrateMercy Courtesy of CelebrateMercy

The religion of Islam was founded by Muhammad, the 7th century prophet who Muslims call ""the messenger of God.""

They don't consider him divine, but they follow his teachings closely. Good Muslims are taught to emulate the prophet in all matters, personal, spiritual and worldly.

Perhaps no time in recent history has it been more important to do as the Prophet Muhammad did  and not as someone says he did.

With terror groups like ISIS now invoking his name, many Muslim leaders say radicals who cite the prophet to justify violence misrepresent his teachings.

Some Muslim leaders argue that young Muslims need a firmer grounding in their own faith and the prophetic tradition, both to equip them better to counter religious propagandists and also to bind them more closely to Islam.

i toggle caption Courtesy of CelebrateMercy Courtesy of CelebrateMercy

Most of what is known about how Muhammad lived is set down in the Hadith, which consist of recollections of the prophet's life by his companions, first passed on orally and later put down in writing. Taken together, they constitute what Muslims call the ""tradition.""

One effort to promote religious literacy among young Muslims is the CelebrateMercy initiative. Sheikh Hassan Lachheb, a Moroccan-born Islamic scholar from Knoxville, Tenn.  along with a slate of guest speakers  conducts a series of lectures around the country, titled ""Portrait of a Prophet.""

He reads selections from the Hadith, some of them apparently mundane stories about how Muhammad lived, and explains what young Muslims can learn from them. (Click the audio link above to hear the full story.)

Even what seems like the most trivial detail  what kind of sandal he wore, for instance  serves a purpose: humanizing Muhammad, making it easier for Muslims to emulate him.

Hassan argues that if Muslims had more knowledge of how the Prophet Muhammad actually lived and what he taught, they would be less vulnerable to extremist propaganda. Counterterrorism officials  who've focused largely on surveillance, sting operations and community policing  would have more success countering extremism, he says, if they supported efforts to deepen religious literacy among young Muslims.

He cites the abundance of examples from the Hadith that emphasize charity and respect for other faiths.

The tradition associated with the Prophet Muhammad, Hassan says, ""has never been radicalized and has always produced beauty, always produced involvement in the community, always produced tolerance.""

""If you're bypassing all of that to come with a political solution (to extremism),"" Hassan says, ""I don't think it's going to work.""

Below are a few lessons from the life of Muhammad.

The Lifestyle Of The Prophet

Among Muhammad's favorite foods were dates, melon and cucumbers. He enjoyed cool, sweet drinks, including a type of date juice, often mixed with milk and honey. His followers often brought him food from their gardens. He always sent them home with a gift in return.

The prophet is said to have had a thick head of hair and wore it long. It was gray on the sides, and like many men he oiled it with a henna-like product that gave it a reddish tint. The streets were often filled with dust and to keep his oiled hair protected, he often wore a scarf on his head, like a bandanna.

Before going to sleep each night, the prophet would blow on his hands. Even in his sleep, he could be heard blowing. It was not a snoring sound. He normally slept on his right side.

The Significance

The Hadith contain many narrations about the Prophet Muhammad's personal appearance and habits. Muslims are encouraged to learn about these apparently trivial aspects of his story, because it helps them feel more connected to him.

""One of the things we're taught is that we should love the prophet, not just intellectually but experientially,"" says Dalia Mogahed, a guest speaker at a Celebrate Mercy course held in Maryland recently. ""How do we do that without detailed information  the way he walked, the way, he stood, the way he looked. It's about imagining who he was.""

Hassan, the sheikh, reminds his students that the prophet lived in a particular time in Arabia. Some of the things he did and said should be understood in their cultural and historical context, such as how many wives he had and at what age they were betrothed.

Guidance For Daily Life

Muhammad and his family ate a type of bread made with barley. He often gave the bread away before sharing it with his family. By the time he distributed it in his household, the bread was sometimes as hard as a rock. He would dip the bread in water to soften it, but there was not much to go around. The prophet's family did not have their fill of barley bread until after he passed away.

The prophet preached that living a life of ascetism and poverty does not mean one has to be scruffy. He often told his companions to bathe and sometimes admonished them for not cleaning their fingernails or brushing their teeth or combing their hair. Not being clean, he said, affects one's spiritual state.

The prophet was never obscene in speech nor boisterous. He did not find fault in people. When he was angry with someone, he simply turned away. When he was happy, he lowered his gaze. When he laughed, he flashed his white teeth.

The Significance

Some of the Hadith offer Muslims guidance for their daily lives. Moaz Hayat, 18, a student at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., says one lesson he took from the course about the prophet is that he should take better care of his body, as the prophet did.

""He was a very well-built man,"" Hayat says. ""He wasn't just a scholar sitting in an ivory tower.""

i toggle caption Tom Gjelten/NPR Tom Gjelten/NPR

Sheikh Hassan uses the story of the prophet's aversion to profanity to tell his students that ""obscenity is not cool. We have to teach our children this,"" he said. ""I'm sorry, but I'm talking from experience in the immigrant community. Too many think it's cool to say stuff like the N-word. It's not fun. We have to combat it. We do have racism in our community.""

A Lesson On Inclusion And Politics

When Muhammad moved to Medina from Mecca, he found it to be a far more cosmopolitan city, with a large and thriving Jewish community. In Medina, the prophet followed many Jewish habits, even if they differed from what the Muslims did. The Jews, for example, wore their hair in a distinctive style, and the prophet changed his hair style in Medina to match theirs.

The Significance

The Prophet Muhammad ""wanted the Jews to feel close,"" Hassan, the sheikh, says. ""They were 'People of the Book,' (from the Abrahamic tradition and whose beliefs are based on a holy text).""

Elaborating on the story, Mogahed  who studies Muslim-American communities as director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding  says it showed the prophet ""wanted to lessen the barrier between Muslims and Jews. He wanted to connect with them.""

This was a story, she says, with implications for how Muslim-Americans should see their role in U.S. society.

""What this means is, we have to understand the culture and the context we live in,"" she says. ""We should do all that we can to connect to people and respect their culture.""",[]

i toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images

Canada and the U.S. have announced a cooperative plan to tackle climate change by cutting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, investing in clean energy research and reducing future hydrofluorocarbon use.

At a joint press conference in the White House Rose Garden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and President Obama praised the strong ties between Canada and the U.S. They also announced plans to further facilitate trade between the two countries and expressed a shared commitment to protect the environment.

""As the first U.S. president to visit the Arctic, I saw how both of our nations are threatened by rising seas, melting permafrost, disappearing glaciers and sea ice,"" Obama said.

""The president and I share a common goal: We want a clean-growth economy that continues to provide good jobs and great opportunities for all of our citizens,"" Trudeau said. ""And I'm confident that by working together, we'll get there sooner than we think.""

Trudeau's visit to the White House is the first by a sitting Canadian prime minister in nearly two decades. And the collaborative approach to regulating the oil and gas industry comes after years of tension between the Obama and Canadian leaders over the White House's opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline.

Trudeau, who assumed his post in November, is just starting his time as the leader of Canada; Obama, for his part, is in his final year in office. But Obama told reporters he's confident that their agreement will survive the next administration.

The two leaders have committed to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent, relative to 2012 levels, by 2025, and to join a World Bank campaign to reduce routine flaring at gas and oil operations.

Their joint statement on climate change efforts included a number of other shared commitments, including:

Ratifying the Paris Agreement as soon as possible

Implementing aligned emission standards for tractor-trailers and buses (in addition to existing standards for cars and light trucks)

Phasing down use of hydrofluorocarbons, an alternative to CFCs that don't damage the ozone layer but do contribute to climate change.

Making it easier for renewable energy to be integrated into existing power grids in the two nations

Phasing out fossil fuel subsidies

Improving the efficiency of appliances and equipment

The Keystone XL pipeline  which strained ties between the U.S. and Canada over the past few years, and dominated discussions of energy between the two nations  was not mentioned.

The two leaders also expressed a desire to collaborate to protect the Arctic beyond reducing the impact of climate change. They set a goal of protecting 17 percent of Arctic land and 10 percent of marine areas, and said they were committed to involving indigenous leaders, as well as traditional knowledge, in decisions related to the Arctic.

The shared commitment to fighting climate change, in particular, was received as a significant shift in both nations' positions.

Last year, NPR's Christopher Joyce wrote that when it came to international cooperation on climate change, ""the U.S. government has been like the big-ticket movie star who has been offered the lead role, but won't commit.""

And Canada? In The New Republic last fall, Rebecca Leber called Canada under former Prime Minister Stephen Harper a ""climate villain.""

With Thursday's joint statement, Obama and Trudeau indicated they now want their countries to step to the forefront of the global conversation on climate change.

""We know that our international partners expect  and indeed need  leadership from us on this issue,"" Trudeau said.",[]

i toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP

The FCC has unveiled a proposal that would restrict Internet providers' ability to share the information they collect about what their customers do online with advertisers and other third parties.

If adopted, these would be the first privacy rules for Internet service providers, resulting largely from last year's net neutrality regulations that expanded the Federal Communications Commission's oversight authority over the industry. (Those rules are currently pending in court.)

Thursday's unveiling of the proposal from Chairman Tom Wheeler is just a first step: The FCC is expected to vote to formally propose this plan on March 31, soliciting public comments on a variety of questions about how the rules should work before the final version gets drafted.

The key elements of Wheeler's proposal include a requirement that broadband providers such as Comcast, Verizon or T-Mobile clearly disclose what data they collect on you  for instance, it could be browsing history, use of apps or location  and how they shared that collected data with other companies for marketing or other purposes.

In some instances, subscribers would be asked to opt in or they'd be given a choice to opt out, depending on how the information is used. (Re/code has a helpful breakdown of the details.) The proposal also has provisions for better security of the information traveling through ISPs' networks.

Wheeler wrote in a Huffington Post op-ed that ISPs should be held to the same privacy standard as telephone companies:

""Your ISP handles all of your network traffic. That means it has a broad view of all of your unencrypted online activity  when you are online, the websites you visit, and the apps you use. If you have a mobile device, your provider can track your physical location throughout the day in real time. Even when data is encrypted, your broadband provider can piece together significant amounts of information about you  including private information such as a chronic medical condition or financial problems  based on your online activity. ""The information collected by the phone company about your telephone usage has long been protected information. Regulations of the (FCC) limit your phone company's ability to repurpose and resell what it learns about your phone activity. ""The same should be true for information collected by your ISP.""

Telecom companies are resisting the FCC's push to regulate their privacy practices, arguing that this puts them on unequal footing compared with websites and web services such as Google that also collect a lot of information about people's digital tracks. As The New York Times points out, those companies are overseen by another agency:

""The regulations, if approved, would put broadband providers under stronger privacy oversight than Internet companies like Google and Facebook. Those companies are monitored by the Federal Trade Commission, whose ability to create specific privacy rules is limited. ""Many privacy advocates have pushed for a greater role by other agencies because the F.T.C. cannot create rules for online privacy and can only monitor data collection practices as an enforcement agency.""

AT&T's Bob Quinn, senior vice president of federal regulatory affairs, said in a blog post this week that Internet providers ""do not currently live in a 'regulatory-free zone' when it comes to privacy,"" but one guided by the FTC's regime, which prohibits deceptive and unfair trade practices:",[]

i toggle caption Toru Hanai/AP Toru Hanai/AP

Five years after an earthquake and tsunami caused a series of meltdowns at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant in Japan, there are signs of progress. Many workers cleaning up the ruined plant no longer need to suit up in full respirators. Some nearby villages that were evacuated are open to residents.

But there are still plenty of problems.

""Fukushima Dai-ichi is a complicated clean-up site,"" says Dale Klein, a former chairman of the U.S Nuclear Regulatory Commission who now consults for the Tokyo Electric Power Company, or TEPCO, which owns the plant.

PLOTTING THE FALLOUT: A map made by the volunteer organization Safecast indicates that radiation levels remain elevated in the region around Fukushima Dai-ichi. In areas that are orange, yellow or white, levels are high and an evacuation order remains in place. Areas in pink and purple are safe to live in, provided extensive decontamination efforts are effective. Blue denotes areas where radiation is at natural levels.

Perhaps the biggest problem is water, Klein says. Groundwater from nearby mountains constantly seeps through the ruined building before spilling into the ocean. TEPCO has tried a number of different approaches (including a massive underground ice wall) to try and slow the incursion, but so far efforts to stop it have been only partially successful.

Instead, the company must send the groundwater through a complex filtration system that removes radioactivity. The system is effective at removing some of the most dangerous elements, but one isotope of hydrogen, called tritium, can't be removed because it's literally embedded in the H 2 O of the water molecules.

""Tritium is part of the water itself, so how do you filter water out of water?"" Klein says.

The best solution might be to dilute the radioactive groundwater and then release it into the ocean. But fishermen and the public would have to be convinced. For now, nearly a million tons of water is being stored all over the site.

""There are about a thousand containers, steel containers that hold this water,"" he says.

i toggle caption Kimmimasa Mayama/AFP/Getty Images Kimmimasa Mayama/AFP/Getty Images

The land around the plant was also contaminated by the accident. Azby Brown is with the nonprofit organization Safecast, which independently monitors radiation levels in Fukushima prefecture. He says readings by Safecast and the government show that radiation levels in the region around the plant have fallen by roughly half.

""There's no question that the radiation levels have decreased compared to 2011,"" he says.

Some of that drop is due to the natural radioactive decay, but there has also been a huge cleanup effort. Workers across Fukushima have been scraping up contaminated topsoil and storing it in bags. And that's created its own problem, Brown says.

""There are now about 9 million bags of decontamination waste from all over the prefecture that are being consolidated into these vast fields with these pyramids of radioactive waste,"" he says.

Just like with the water, regulators aren't quite sure what to do with all that soil. Japan doesn't have a centralized radioactive waste dump to take it to.

In the longer term, the biggest issue will be what to do with the highly radioactive cores of the reactors themselves, each filled with melted uranium fuel. After the Chernobyl nuclear accident in Ukraine, Soviet officials opted to pour concrete over the melted reactor core. But TEPCO's chief nuclear officer, Takafumi Anegawa, says Fukushima's fuel has got to be removed because the plant's presence on the coast poses a threat to the environment. ""This condition cannot continue for many years,"" he says.

toggle caption GAMMA/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images

Unfortunately, TEPCO doesn't really have any firm ideas about how to get the melted fuel out. ""So far, there's no specific clear solution,"" Anegawa says.

In fact, the company hasn't even been able to look inside to see what needs to be done. Anegawa says the radiation is so intense that it's fried the circuits of several robots sent in to investigate.

Dale Klein, the safety consultant, thinks that eventually robots will be used to cut up the molten cores of the reactors and seal them inside concrete containers. But he says it's not going to happen overnight.

""This will be a several-decades process of cleanup,"" he says.

In other words, the Fukushima accident will be with the people of Japan for generations to come.",[]

i Katherine Streeter for NPR Katherine Streeter for NPR

When it's time for medical care, where do you go? The doctor's office? An urgent care clinic? Or the nearest hospital?

As many as 1 in 3 Americans sought care in an ER in the past two years, according to a recent poll by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. That relatively high frequency may be a matter of convenience, even though many in the poll also report frustration with the cost and quality of care they received in an ER.

Skipper Beck, for instance, who lives in Holiday, Fla., near Tampa, wasn't crazy about the care he got. As he remembers it, he was having a great Friday, playing beach football on Florida's Gulf Coast, when he hurt himself.

""I hit someone a little too hard, a little bit too low,"" says Beck, who is 36 years old.

By that evening, Beck couldn't rotate his shoulder. It was painful to lift any weight, he says. He thought maybe he'd dislocated the shoulder, fractured it, or maybe torn something. So, late that night, he headed to the ER.

The medical staff ran tests, put him in a sling and sent him on his way  4 1/2 hours later. ""Honesty I felt like cattle,"" he says. ""Kind of 'get me in, get me out.' ""

Beck thinks the cost for his ER visit was unreasonable, and he felt like the doctors didn't care about him. In fact, about a quarter of the people NPR polled in Florida say the ER care they got was fair or poor, and only a third say it was excellent.

The relatively high cost and no-frills treatment in traditional emergency departments may be because most ERs are designed to treat life or death emergencies  gunshots, a heart attack, a bad car accident.

But 47 percent of recent patients in the U.S. say they seek care in an ER for non-urgent reasons. They go because it's convenient, says, Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Many (28 percent) say their main reason for choosing an ER for treatment, instead of a doctor's office, urgent care facility or community health clinic was because the other facilities weren't open, or the poll respondent couldn't get an appointment. About 3 percent nationally  and 8 percent in Florida  say they mainly chose an ER for treatment because the other facilities were too far away.

""Almost a third of people in Florida have used an ER in the last two years,"" Blendon says.

Many people assume that the only patients who choose an ER for care that's not an emergency are poor and uninsured, and don't have a regular doctor. But Blendon says that's an oversimplification: In fact, more than 80 percent of Floridians polled who used an ER are covered by health insurance.

What can be done to shift more of the non-urgent cases out of the ER?

i toggle caption Courtesy of Delilah Torres Courtesy of Delilah Torres

It would help, Blendon says, if the medical world were more responsive to the problem. For instance, more community doctors could hold some office hours on evenings or weekends, so they could potentially see a patient like Skipper Beck late on a Friday, or see patients on short notice when they're sick.

""I'm hoping we'll change a bit of the discussion,"" he says. ""You have to have a place to go, and the hours have to reflect the life of people.""

But ERs are important to hospital revenue, and people seek help there for many reasons. So some hospitals are trying to make the ER experience more convenient for patients. Some emergency departments now allow patients to schedule appointments, for instance. And others modify their care and facilities to attract a particular subset of the community  such as the parents of sick or hurt children.

Delilah Torres, whose 10-year-old son, Ryan, has Down syndrome, appreciates that sort of special attention to kids.

""There were many times, many times in the past when I waited before taking Ryan to the emergency room because I knew how stressful it is to sit at the waiting room for hours,"" she says.

A few weeks ago, Torres had a very different experience at Nemours Children's Hospital in Orlando, Fla. When she and her son arrived in the ER, she says, the staff brought Ryan into a special room, with soothing music and toys, and talked to his mother about what upsets him.

Torres says Ryan is strong, and four nurses are usually needed to draw blood from him, or put in an IV line.

""This time was the first time it actually only took two nurses to put a line in Ryan,"" she says.

The Nemours Children's Hospital, in central Florida, is just a few years old. Its waiting room is painted in bright colors, and has round, plushy cubby holes cut into the wall for fun seating for the kids. Free slushies are available in the ER.

Cara Harwell, a nurse practitioner there, points out a sign that says REACH: Respecting Each Awesome Child Here.

""We want the parents to self-identify that they have a child with autism or a similar condition, like a sensory processing disorder or a mental health disorder,"" Harwell says.

That friendly approach in the ER will help the hospital's ""patient satisfaction scores,"" she says. Funding is partly tied to performance in those rankings, and hospital officials are studying how it affects other aspects of care.

""Before we even put our hands on them, if we can know what the child likes and doesn't like, we can prevent them from becoming ... agitated [and from hurting] themselves or someone else,"" Harwell says. ""We can also reduce the use of sedatives or restraints.""

Plastic makes great food packaging. It's waterproof and flexible. And best of all, it's impervious to all known bacteria  until now. Researchers have found a bacterium in the debris fields around a recycling plant in Japan that can feed off a common type of plastic used in clothing, plastic bottles and food packaging.

The bacterium is a new species called Ideonella sakaiensis, named for the Japanese city Sakai where it was found growing on plastic debris made from a type of plastic called PET or polyethylene terephthalate. ""It's the most unique thing. This bacterium can degrade PET and then make their body from PET,"" says Shosuke Yoshida, a microbiologist at Kyoto University and lead author on the study published in Science on Thursday.

Most plastics are insurmountable obstacles for microbes because plastics are large chains of repeating molecules called polymers. The entire chain is far larger than the individual microbe. ""So the organism can't take it inside the cell to metabolize it,"" says John Coates, a microbiologist at the University of California, Berkeley who was not involved with the work. Imagine a baby trying to eat an enormous pizza from the middle. It can't do it. The pie is too big.

But Ideonella sakaiensis, which we here at NPR have decided to call ""the polymer chomper,"" has two enzymes that can slice and dice the plastic polymer into smaller pieces. In other words, the baby gets a pizza cutter. The bacterium can then take the pieces and eat them, eventually converting the plastic into carbon dioxide and water.

After Yoshida and his colleagues isolated the polymer chomper, they were able to watch it disintegrate a plastic film in about six weeks. It would be great if we could culture the bacteria, spray landfills down with them and let them deal with our mountains of plastic refuse. But alas, that may never happen. ""It grows very fast,"" Yoshida explains, ""but it's likely not so useful in the field"" because it chomps very slowly.

And if getting rid of our plastic waste were so easy, Coates notes, the bacterium would likely have already been found in landfills and anywhere you find mounds of plastic waste.

But with more research, Coates thinks that the bacterium might be engineered for such a purpose. ""It's certainly a move in the right direction. Having an organism that seems to be capable of biodegrading these components directly will help us develop a bioremediation technology,"" he says. Certain species of fungi have been found to be able to degrade plastics before  though none have been converted to landfill-munching purposes. The polymer chomper offers new hope, Coates says, because bacteria are easier to work with and engineer.

That doesn't mean we'll ever be able to toss our plastic without care. Recycling will likely remain a better option anyway, Coates adds. ""Environmentally, I would prefer recycling if it can be optimized and improved,"" he says. Biodegrading materials still releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which would contribute to global warming. But in cases where recycling is not feasible, he says maybe this little bacterium could one day prove a useful alternative.",[]

i toggle caption David Gilkey/NPR David Gilkey/NPR

Last month, I visited a displaced persons camp in South Sudan and met a woman who said she'd spent almost a year hiding in a swamp. She spent her days submerged, her head just above water. At night she'd emerge to search for food.

She's one of the hundreds of thousands of people who have fled their homes over the past two years to escape that country's brutal civil war. It's hard to imagine that so many people would give up their worldly goods and flee into the bush. A new report from Amnesty International helps explain why.

The report, issued Thursday, looks at one atrocity that not only claimed dozens of lives, but sowed fear in the living left behind.

Amnesty International says that in October of 2015, government soldiers rounded up more than 60 men and boys in Leer, a town in the northern Unity state, locked them in a shipping container until they suffocated, then dumped their bodies in a nearby field. They were accused of supporting the opposition rebels.

""Witnesses described to us how the men were detained. How they were forced into this container,"" says Lama Fakih, a crisis adviser with Amnesty International who spent two weeks last month in South Sudan investigating the massacre. Amnesty International interviewed 42 people who saw parts of the incident, she says. ""Some [of the witnesses] were just outside the container and could hear the detainees banging on the sides of the container, screaming.""

i toggle caption Courtesy of Amnesty International Courtesy of Amnesty International

According to the report, soldiers opened the container to remove the bodies of some of the men who'd suffocated to death but then locked the doors again with the rest of the people inside. After 24 hours, all but one of the detainees were dead.

This incident is significant for several reasons. First, Amnesty International is calling it a war crime by the Sudanese government against its own people. Second, it occurred two months after the warring parties  the forces of South Sudanese President Salva Kiir and troops led by his former vice president, Reik Machar  signed a peace accord. An international commission charged with monitoring that cease-fire also documented reports of the shipping container killing in a confidential memo dated Dec. 18, 2015. Some details in that memo are slightly different from what Amnesty International found, but the main facts are strikingly similar.

The cease-fire commission's report said, ""Between 20 and 22 October 2015 a group of Government Forces were involved in some sort of operation in Leer County, during which cattle were seized and about 50 people (reports vary between 53 and 60) were rounded up and put in a shipping container in Leer. The container is in the compound used by Government Forces as a headquarters. A large number of those people suffocated. Their bodies were taken and thrown into the bush along the Gandor road.""

The ""compound"" where this happened was a church.

Government troops had commandeered the grounds of the Comboni Catholic Church in Leer after the clergy had fled. The soldiers were using the church grounds as a base.

""Unsubstantiated reports suggest that the few [detainees] who survived were killed,"" the cease-fire commission memo adds. ""There are further reports that the only survivor was an eight-year-old boy.""

Amnesty International heard that there was a lone boy who survived but puts his age at 12. One of the unnamed witnesses in the AI report says that when the shipping container was finally opened, there was a pile of bodies 3 feet high. ""What we saw was tragic ... the container was full of people, they had fallen over one another and onto the floor,"" she's quoted as saying.

This massacre is being blamed on government forces, but reports from the African Union, Human Rights Watch and others say both sides in this civil war have committed crimes against humanity including raping women, castrating child soldiers, killing civilians and even allegedly forcing captives to drink human blood.

""Sadly this is one horrific experience in a long litany of violations that we have documented being perpetrated by government forces or allied militias against the civilian population,"" says Amnesty International's Lama Fakih about the shipping container incident. ""And again the abuses we have documented took place after the signing of the peace agreement.""

i toggle caption Courtesy of CelebrateMercy Courtesy of CelebrateMercy

The religion of Islam was founded by Muhammad, the 7th century prophet whom Muslims call ""the messenger of God.""

They don't consider him divine, but they follow his teachings closely. Good Muslims are taught to emulate the prophet in all matters, personal, spiritual and worldly.

Perhaps no time in recent history has it been more important to do as the Prophet Muhammad did  and not as someone says he did.

With terror groups like ISIS now invoking his name, many Muslim leaders say radicals who cite the prophet to justify violence misrepresent his teachings.

Some Muslim leaders argue that young Muslims need a firmer grounding in their own faith and the prophetic tradition, both to equip them better to counter religious propagandists and also to bind them more closely to Islam.

i toggle caption Courtesy of CelebrateMercy Courtesy of CelebrateMercy

Most of what is known about how Muhammad lived is set down in the Hadith, which consist of recollections of the prophet's life by his companions, first passed on orally and later put down in writing. Taken together, they constitute what Muslims call the ""tradition.""

One effort to promote religious literacy among young Muslims is the CelebrateMercy initiative. Sheikh Hassan Lachheb, a Moroccan-born Islamic scholar from Knoxville, Tenn.  along with a slate of guest speakers  conducts a series of lectures around the country, titled ""Portrait of a Prophet.""

He reads selections from the Hadith, some of them apparently mundane stories about how Muhammad lived, and explains what young Muslims can learn from them. (Click the audio link above to hear the full story.)

Even what seems like the most trivial detail  what kind of sandal he wore, for instance  serves a purpose: humanizing Muhammad, making it easier for Muslims to emulate him.

Hassan argues that if Muslims had more knowledge of how the Prophet Muhammad actually lived and what he taught, they would be less vulnerable to extremist propaganda. Counterterrorism officials  who've focused largely on surveillance, sting operations and community policing  would have more success countering extremism, he says, if they supported efforts to deepen religious literacy among young Muslims.

He cites the abundance of examples from the Hadith that emphasize charity and respect for other faiths.

The tradition associated with the Prophet Muhammad, Hassan says, ""has never been radicalized and has always produced beauty, always produced involvement in the community, always produced tolerance.""

""If you're bypassing all of that to come with a political solution (to extremism),"" Hassan says, ""I don't think it's going to work.""

Below are a few lessons from the life of Muhammad.

The Lifestyle Of The Prophet

Among Muhammad's favorite foods were dates, melon and cucumbers. He enjoyed cool, sweet drinks, including a type of date juice, often mixed with milk and honey. His followers often brought him food from their gardens. He always sent them home with a gift in return.

The prophet is said to have had a thick head of hair and wore it long. It was gray on the sides, and like many men he oiled it with a henna-like product that gave it a reddish tint. The streets were often filled with dust and to keep his oiled hair protected, he often wore a scarf on his head, like a bandanna.

Before going to sleep each night, the prophet would blow on his hands. Even in his sleep, he could be heard blowing. It was not a snoring sound. He normally slept on his right side.

The Significance

The Hadith contain many narrations about the Prophet Muhammad's personal appearance and habits. Muslims are encouraged to learn about these apparently trivial aspects of his story, because it helps them feel more connected to him.

""One of the things we're taught is that we should love the prophet, not just intellectually but experientially,"" says Dalia Mogahed, a guest speaker at a Celebrate Mercy course held in Maryland recently. ""How do we do that without detailed information  the way he walked, the way, he stood, the way he looked. It's about imagining who he was.""

Hassan, the sheikh, reminds his students that the prophet lived in a particular time in Arabia. Some of the things he did and said should be understood in their cultural and historical context, such as how many wives he had and at what age they were betrothed.

Guidance For Daily Life

Muhammad and his family ate a type of bread made with barley. He often gave the bread away before sharing it with his family. By the time he distributed it in his household, the bread was sometimes as hard as a rock. He would dip the bread in water to soften it, but there was not much to go around. The prophet's family did not have their fill of barley bread until after he passed away.

The prophet preached that living a life of ascetism and poverty does not mean one has to be scruffy. He often told his companions to bathe and sometimes admonished them for not cleaning their fingernails or brushing their teeth or combing their hair. Not being clean, he said, affects one's spiritual state.

The prophet was never obscene in speech nor boisterous. He did not find fault in people. When he was angry with someone, he simply turned away. When he was happy, he lowered his gaze. When he laughed, he flashed his white teeth.

The Significance

Some of the Hadith offer Muslims guidance for their daily lives. Moaz Hayat, 18, a student at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., says one lesson he took from the course about the prophet is that he should take better care of his body, as the prophet did.

""He was a very well-built man,"" Hayat says. ""He wasn't just a scholar sitting in an ivory tower.""

i toggle caption Tom Gjelten/NPR Tom Gjelten/NPR

Sheikh Hassan uses the story of the prophet's aversion to profanity to tell his students that ""obscenity is not cool. We have to teach our children this,"" he said. ""I'm sorry, but I'm talking from experience in the immigrant community. Too many think it's cool to say stuff like the N-word. It's not fun. We have to combat it. We do have racism in our community.""

A Lesson On Inclusion And Politics

When Muhammad moved to Medina from Mecca, he found it to be a far more cosmopolitan city, with a large and thriving Jewish community. In Medina, the prophet followed many Jewish habits, even if they differed from what the Muslims did. The Jews, for example, wore their hair in a distinctive style, and the prophet changed his hair style in Medina to match theirs.

The Significance

The Prophet Muhammad ""wanted the Jews to feel close,"" Hassan, the sheikh, says. ""They were 'People of the Book,' (from the Abrahamic tradition and whose beliefs are based on a holy text).""

Elaborating on the story, Mogahed  who studies Muslim-American communities as director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding  says it showed the prophet ""wanted to lessen the barrier between Muslims and Jews. He wanted to connect with them.""

This was a story, she says, with implications for how Muslim-Americans should see their role in U.S. society.

""What this means is, we have to understand the culture and the context we live in,"" she says. ""We should do all that we can to connect to people and respect their culture.""",[]

The apparent assault comes on the heels of another altercation showing a woman being pushed at a Trump rally last week, as well as two stories (here and here) of reporters having physical run-ins with Trump's security and staff. The Trump campaign has denied one of the incidents took place.

The most recent video shows a young man who appears to be African-American raising his middle fingers to the North Carolina crowd as he is being led out of the Crown Coliseum. An audience member rares back his fist and takes several steps towards the protester before punching him in the face. The next frames of the video show police detaining the man who had been punched, but not his attacker.

Rally attendee John McGraw was since charged with assault and disorderly conduct in Wednesday's incident, according to a post on Cumberland County Sheriff Earl ""Moose"" Butler's Facebook page. Butler said the deputies who were escorting out the protester did not actually see the assault take place. They later viewed footage of the event to identify McGraw.

""No one should be subjected to such a cowardly, unprovoked act as that committed by McGraw,"" said Butler.

Several months ago, referring to a protester at one of his rallies, Trump said, ""Maybe he should have been roughed up."" He has also made veiled threats against media reporters, said he would defend in court anyone who hurt a protester at another rally, and said ""I'd like to punch him in the face,"" about another protester.

Protesters and hecklers at presidential rallies aren't a new phenomenon. They followed former President George W. Bush and still follow President Obama.

But Carolyn Lukensmeyer, director of the National Institute for Civil Discourse, a non-partisan advocacy group, said she can't remember a recent time when animosity towards the protesters actually broke out into a physical fight.

Lukensmeyer fears incidents like this represent a dark turn in American politics. ""We're now seeming to cross a line where the commitment to plurality and civil society is being lost,"" she said. ""We're crossing lots of lines here and lots of Americans are increasingly disturbed by it.""",[]

California Gov. Jerry Brown signed landmark legislation last October that would allow terminally ill people to request life-ending medication from their physicians.

But no one knew when the law would take effect, because of the unusual way in which the law was passed  in a legislative ""extraordinary session"" called by Brown. The bill could not go into effect until 90 days after that session adjourned.

The session closed Thursday, which means the ""End of Life Option Act"" will go into effect June 9.

""We're glad to finally have arrived at this day where we have a date certain,"" says Sen. Bill Monning, D-Carmel.

""It's a historic achievement for California, and for a limited universe of people dealing with a terminal illness,"" Monning says. ""It could indeed be a transformative way of giving them the option of a compassionate end-of-life process.""

Disability-rights advocates fought hard last year against passage of the legislative act, and they continue to voice concern.

Marilyn Golden, senior policy analyst with the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund, says it would be impossible to know, for example, if a depressed patient went to many doctors who all denied the request for lethal medication before finding one who agreed to write the prescription.

""We are looking ahead at measures to protect people from abuse,"" Golden says, ""and to explore and inform doctors, nurses and pharmacists that they don't have to participate.""

As written, the law requires two doctors to agree, before prescribing the drugs, that a patient has six months or less to live. Patients must be able to swallow the medication themselves and must affirm in writing, 48 hours before taking the medication, that they will do so.

California is the fifth state to permit this option at the end of life. It joins Vermont, Oregon, Washington and Montana.

Across the state, some patients with advanced cancer welcomed the news.

""It gives me a great peace of mind to know that I will not be forced to die slowly and painfully,"" says Elizabeth Wallner, in a release from Compassion & Choices, an aid-in-dying advocacy group. Wallner, 52, of Sacramento, is a single mother with stage IV colon cancer that has spread to her liver and lungs.

""It gives great comfort to know that the agonizingly traumatic image of me suffering will not be my family's last memory of me,"" she says.

Monning says he's grateful to people who worked for passage of the law, some in their final days:

Brittany Maynard , an Orange County, Calif., woman with brain cancer, moved to Oregon to take advantage of laws there that allowed her to get lethal medication. Before she died in 2014, she recorded a video that was shown during hearings on the ""End of Life Option Act"" in Sacramento.

i toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images

The legal dispute between Apple and the FBI continues: the government has filed a response to Apple's refusal to cooperate with a federal magistrate's order instructing it to assist the FBI in circumventing the security features on an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.

In their legal filings, Apple and the government face off on a number of issues. Apple says the government is using the court system to assert broad authority that hasn't been granted by Congress; the government says Apple is overstating the wide-reaching security concerns and creating ""warrantproof"" devices.

Below, in the words of their own filings, are a few of the issues where the two parties most fiercely disagree:

Is Apple too far removed from the Farook case?

The magistrate judge's order instructing Apple to cooperate with the FBI's request relies on the All Writs Act, a 1789 law that courts have used to compel companies' assistance in investigations. The All Writs Act, or AWA, can only be used if it's not an unreasonable burden on the company, and if the company isn't ""too far removed"" from the situation.

Apple says its connection to the case doesn't justify it being ""drafted into government service"": ""Apple is a private company that does not own or possess the phone at issue, has no connection to the data that may or may not exist on the phone, and is not related in any way to the events giving rise to the investigation.""

""Apple is a private company that does not own or possess the phone at issue, has no connection to the data that may or may not exist on the phone, and is not related in any way to the events giving rise to the investigation."" The government argues that Apple has a ""continued connection"" to phones after they are sold: ""Apple intentionally and for commercial advantage retains exclusive control over the software that can be used on iPhones, giving it monopoly-like control over the means of distributing software to the phones. ... Having established suzerainty over its users' phonesand control over the precise features of the phones necessary for unlocking themApple cannot now pretend to be a bystander, watching this investigation from afar.""

[In case you, like us, were thrown for a loop by the word ""suzerainty,"" it means the position or power of a suzerain, or feudal overlord.]

What about a possible future burden?

Apple argues writing the software would pose an undue burden, particularly because its burden would be multiplied by future requests: ""If Apple creates new software to open a back door, other federal and state prosecutorsand other governments and agencieswill repeatedly seek orders compelling Apple to use the software to open the back door for tens of thousands of iPhones.""

""If Apple creates new software to open a back door, other federal and state prosecutorsand other governments and agencieswill repeatedly seek orders compelling Apple to use the software to open the back door for tens of thousands of iPhones."" The government says there's no precedent for considering potential future burdens, and says only the burden of writing software for this phone should be considered: ""By accumulating its hypothetical future burdens, Apple suggests that because so much criminal evidence is hidden on its warrant-proof iPhones, it should not be compelled to assist in gathering evidence related to the terrorist attack in San Bernardino. Apple is wrong.""

Is using the All Writs Act an example of judicial overreach?

Apple also argues that this particular use of the AWA extends beyond precedent in a way that ought to be decided by Congress: ""Congress has never authorized judges to compel innocent third parties to provide decryption services to the FBI. Indeed, Congress has expressly withheld that authority in other contexts, and this issue is currently the subject of a raging national policy debate. ... The unprecedented order requested by the government ... would preempt decisions that should be left to the will of the people through laws passed by Congress and signed by the President.""

""Congress has never authorized judges to compel innocent third parties to provide decryption services to the FBI. Indeed, Congress has expressly withheld that authority in other contexts, and this issue is currently the subject of a raging national policy debate. ... The unprecedented order requested by the government ... would preempt decisions that should be left to the will of the people through laws passed by Congress and signed by the President."" U.S. Attorneys respond ... : ""Congress intended for the Act to be broad and flexible, capable of rising to meet new obstacles to the courts' lawful exercise of jurisdiction. The Act is not a judicial usurpation of congressional power, but rather an example of Congress's reliance upon the courts' sound discretion and close familiarity with specific facts to ensure that justice is done."" ... and also argue this precise argument has been used before, and the nation's highest court found it wanting: ""In deciding New York Telephone, the Supreme Court directly confronted and expressly rejected the policy arguments Apple raises now. Like Apple, the telephone company argued: that Congress had not given courts the power to issue such an order in its prior legislation; that the AWA could not be read so broadly; that it was for Congress to decide whether to provide such authority; and that relying on the AWA was a dangerous step down a slippery slope ending in arbitrary police powers. ... In the forty years since that decision, it has become clear that the Court was correct because those fears have proved unfounded.""

Could such software be reused?

Apple: ""Once the process is created, it provides an avenue for criminals and foreign agents to access millions of iPhones. And once developed for our government, it is only a matter of time before foreign governments demand the same tool.""

""Once the process is created, it provides an avenue for criminals and foreign agents to access millions of iPhones. And once developed for our government, it is only a matter of time before foreign governments demand the same tool."" The government: ""As Apple well knows, the Order does not compel it to unlock other iPhones or to give the government a universal 'master key' or 'back door.' It is a narrow, targeted order that will produce a narrow, targeted piece of software capable of running on just one iPhone, in the security of Apple's corporate headquarters.""

The legal dispute between Apple and the FBI continues: the government has filed a response to Apple's refusal to cooperate with a federal magistrate's order instructing it to assist the FBI in circumventing the security features on an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.

In their legal filings, Apple and the government face off on a number of issues. Apple says the government is using the court system to assert broad authority that hasn't been granted by Congress; the government says Apple is overstating the wide-reaching security concerns and creating ""warrantproof"" devices.

Below, in the words of their own filings, are a few of the issues where the two parties most fiercely disagree:

Is Apple too far removed from the Farook case?

The magistrate judge's order instructing Apple to cooperate with the FBI's request relies on the All Writs Act, a 1789 law that courts have used to compel companies' assistance in investigations. The All Writs Act, or AWA, can only be used if it's not an unreasonable burden on the company, and if the company isn't ""too far removed"" from the situation.

Apple says its connection to the case doesn't justify it being ""drafted into government service"": ""Apple is a private company that does not own or possess the phone at issue, has no connection to the data that may or may not exist on the phone, and is not related in any way to the events giving rise to the investigation.""

""Apple is a private company that does not own or possess the phone at issue, has no connection to the data that may or may not exist on the phone, and is not related in any way to the events giving rise to the investigation."" The government argues that Apple has a ""continued connection"" to phones after they are sold: ""Apple intentionally and for commercial advantage retains exclusive control over the software that can be used on iPhones, giving it monopoly-like control over the means of distributing software to the phones. ... Having established suzerainty over its users' phonesand control over the precise features of the phones necessary for unlocking themApple cannot now pretend to be a bystander, watching this investigation from afar.""

[In case you, like us, were thrown for a loop by the word ""suzerainty,"" it means the position or power of a suzerain, or feudal overlord.]

What about a possible future burden?

Apple argues writing the software would pose an undue burden, particularly because its burden would be multiplied by future requests: ""If Apple creates new software to open a back door, other federal and state prosecutorsand other governments and agencieswill repeatedly seek orders compelling Apple to use the software to open the back door for tens of thousands of iPhones.""

""If Apple creates new software to open a back door, other federal and state prosecutorsand other governments and agencieswill repeatedly seek orders compelling Apple to use the software to open the back door for tens of thousands of iPhones."" The government says there's no precedent for considering potential future burdens, and says only the burden of writing software for this phone should be considered: ""By accumulating its hypothetical future burdens, Apple suggests that because so much criminal evidence is hidden on its warrant-proof iPhones, it should not be compelled to assist in gathering evidence related to the terrorist attack in San Bernardino. Apple is wrong.""

Is using the All Writs Act an example of judicial overreach?

Apple also argues that this particular use of the AWA extends beyond precedent in a way that ought to be decided by Congress: ""Congress has never authorized judges to compel innocent third parties to provide decryption services to the FBI. Indeed, Congress has expressly withheld that authority in other contexts, and this issue is currently the subject of a raging national policy debate. ... The unprecedented order requested by the government ... would preempt decisions that should be left to the will of the people through laws passed by Congress and signed by the President.""

""Congress has never authorized judges to compel innocent third parties to provide decryption services to the FBI. Indeed, Congress has expressly withheld that authority in other contexts, and this issue is currently the subject of a raging national policy debate. ... The unprecedented order requested by the government ... would preempt decisions that should be left to the will of the people through laws passed by Congress and signed by the President."" U.S. Attorneys respond ... : ""Congress intended for the Act to be broad and flexible, capable of rising to meet new obstacles to the courts' lawful exercise of jurisdiction. The Act is not a judicial usurpation of congressional power, but rather an example of Congress's reliance upon the courts' sound discretion and close familiarity with specific facts to ensure that justice is done."" ... and also argue this precise argument has been used before, and the nation's highest court found it wanting: ""In deciding New York Telephone, the Supreme Court directly confronted and expressly rejected the policy arguments Apple raises now. Like Apple, the telephone company argued: that Congress had not given courts the power to issue such an order in its prior legislation; that the AWA could not be read so broadly; that it was for Congress to decide whether to provide such authority; and that relying on the AWA was a dangerous step down a slippery slope ending in arbitrary police powers. ... In the forty years since that decision, it has become clear that the Court was correct because those fears have proved unfounded.""

Could such software be reused?

Apple: ""Once the process is created, it provides an avenue for criminals and foreign agents to access millions of iPhones. And once developed for our government, it is only a matter of time before foreign governments demand the same tool.""

""Once the process is created, it provides an avenue for criminals and foreign agents to access millions of iPhones. And once developed for our government, it is only a matter of time before foreign governments demand the same tool."" The government: ""As Apple well knows, the Order does not compel it to unlock other iPhones or to give the government a universal 'master key' or 'back door.' It is a narrow, targeted order that will produce a narrow, targeted piece of software capable of running on just one iPhone, in the security of Apple's corporate headquarters.""

i toggle caption Michele K. Short/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures Michele K. Short/Courtesy of Paramount Pictures

[This is a film it's very hard to talk about at all without spoiling at least the premise and the basic setup, but this review does its level best not to go beyond that point.]

""What does this have to do with Cloverfield?""

Putting that question out of your mind during 10 Cloverfield Lane is ignoring the elephant in the room, but everything about the film, from its out-of-the-blue viral campaign to its thrilling commitment to misdirection, makes it possible. Some connections eventually emerge, as might be expected from one of producer J.J. Abrams' puzzlebox narratives, but 10 Cloverfield Lane is not another found-footage War of the Worlds scenario. And it doesn't take place in the wide-open spaces of a city under siege, either. For the longest time, it appears that the Cloverfield franchise is united mainly by the aesthetic principle of offscreen space  not the catchiest hook, but an enormously effective one.

The obvious reason the two films connect so thinly is that 10 Cloverfield Lane wasn't originally conceived as a sort-of sequel, but retrofitted like the chainsaw Bruce Campbell attaches to his arm in Evil Dead II. In sharp contrast to the shaky-cam of Cloverfield, first-time director Dan Trachtenberg gives the opening scenes a classic Hitchcockian quality, nodding specifically to Janet Leigh's dash out of town in Psycho and laying on a muscular score (by Bear McCreary) in homage to Bernard Herrmann. Also like Hitchcock, the story takes a decisive turn once a car peels off the road.

That car belongs to Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a Louisiana woman who's first shown hastily packing her things in a suitcase and a box, and rushing out of her apartment, leaving her wedding ring behind. Shortly after an evening pitstop for fuel, Michelle gets in a car accident that sends her careening down an embankment. When she awakens, she finds herself hooked to an IV drip in an unadorned cement bunker with her leg handcuffed to a pipe. Before she can improvise her way out of trouble, her captor comes thundering through the door. His name is Howard (John Goodman), he explains, and contrary to appearances, he saved Michelle from the wreck and is currently protecting her from threats unknown.

There's reason to believe he's right. Howard claims that after the accident, there was a chemical attack that rendered the air unbreathable, and being the cheerful paranoiac he is, he'd built an underground shelter for just such an occasion. Along with a third resident named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), the two of them have enough supplies to wait out the apocalypse for a year or two, when the toxicity has presumably passed. Howard is a disturbing guy who lords over Michelle and Emmett like a belligerent father, but any attempt to escape risks the likelihood of instant death the moment they peek their heads above ground.

All this may sound like the set-up to an M. Night Shyamalan twist, and certainly 10 Cloverfield Lane does have the obligation to pay off its Twilight Zone premise. But Trachtenberg and his screenwriters, Josh Campbell and Matthew Stuecken, take advantage of the shelter's tight quarters, which contribute to the expected pressure-cooker atmosphere of suspicion and hostility but also open up the punch-drunk comedy of people going mad with boredom. Howard may be a controlling monster, but he's got a kick-ass jukebox and he's always up for board games or late-night viewings of Pretty In Pink on VHS. (Just be sure to compliment him on his spaghetti.)

Goodman's ability to vacillate between regular-guy jocularity and Biblical fury has made him a Coen brothers favorite since Barton Fink, and his performance helps modulate the film's stomach-clenching tonal shifts. But Winstead is every bit as good as the frightened yet resourceful heroine, who has to make difficult decisions about if, when, and how to act, and validate the serpentine logic of the script. Their battle of wills adds a substance to 10 Cloverfield Lane that the improvising ninnies of the original Cloverfield couldn't muster, despite its novel perspective on the monster movie. The gimmickry eventually arrives  and, god help us, the Cloverfield ""mythology""  but by then, the film has succeeded thoroughly on its own terms.",[]

California Gov. Jerry Brown signed landmark legislation last October that would allow terminally ill people to request life-ending medication from their physicians.

But no one knew when the law would take effect, because of the unusual way in which the law was passed  in a legislative ""extraordinary session"" called by Brown. The bill could not go into effect until 90 days after that session adjourned.

The session closed Thursday, which means the End of Life Option Act will go into effect June 9.

""We're glad to finally have arrived at this day where we have a date certain,"" says Sen. Bill Monning, D-Carmel.

""It's a historic achievement for California, and for a limited universe of people dealing with a terminal illness,"" Monning says. ""It could indeed be a transformative way of giving them the option of a compassionate end-of-life process.""

Disability-rights advocates fought hard last year against passage of the legislative act, and they continue to voice concern.

Marilyn Golden, senior policy analyst with the Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund, says it would be impossible to know, for example, if a depressed patient went to many doctors  who all denied the request for lethal medication  before finding one who agreed to write the prescription.

""We are looking ahead at measures to protect people from abuse,"" Golden says, ""and to explore and inform doctors, nurses and pharmacists that they don't have to participate.""

As written, the law requires two doctors to agree, before prescribing the drugs, that a patient has six months or less to live. Patients must be able to swallow the medication themselves and must affirm in writing, 48 hours before taking the medication, that they will do so.

California is the fifth state to permit this option at the end of life. It joins Vermont, Oregon, Washington and Montana.

Across the state, some patients with advanced cancer welcomed the news.

""It gives me a great peace of mind to know that I will not be forced to die slowly and painfully,"" says Elizabeth Wallner, in a release from Compassion & Choices, an aid-in-dying advocacy group. Wallner, 52, of Sacramento, is a single mother with stage 4 colon cancer that has spread to her liver and lungs.

""It gives great comfort to know that the agonizingly traumatic image of me suffering will not be my family's last memory of me,"" she says.

Monning says he's grateful to people who worked for passage of the law, some in their final days:

Brittany Maynard , an Orange County, Calif., woman with brain cancer, moved to Oregon to take advantage of laws there that allowed her to get lethal medication. Before she died in 2014, she recorded a video that was shown during hearings on the End of Life Option Act in Sacramento.

Composer Bear McCreary  yes, that's his real name  has been obsessed with film music since he was 6 years old, when he snuck a tape recorder into Back to the Future just to record the soundtrack.

""When I grew up, I loved movie music,"" he says. ""I liked TV, too  The A-Team and Magnum, P.I. were awesome. But it wasn't the thing that made me say, 'I want to dedicate my life to this.'""

His first major studio film score is for J.J. Abrams' 10 Cloverfield Lane, which opens in theaters on Friday. But his career up to now has been dominated by television, ever since he landed his first job at the age of 24: scoring the rebooted Battlestar Galactica.

YouTube

""Something happened in television about 10 years ago,"" he says. ""There was a wave, a renaissance in creative people moving to television, where suddenly longform, serial storytelling in an adult fashion became possible. And quite frankly, I think the only reason that a 24-year-old kid with no credits is the composer of Battlestar Galactica is because it was a television show. Guys doing films just weren't interested.""

In the decade since, McCreary has composed the music for such high-profile TV series as The Walking Dead, Black Sails, Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and Outlander.

McCreary's career goes back to a chance encounter when he was a junior in high school. The local rotary club in Bellingham, Wash. named him ""student of the month,"" and at the awards luncheon it came up that he was interested in film music. After the event, a man named Joe Coons came up to him and told him he had a friend in the business.

""And I thought, 'All right, whatever, man,' "" McCreary recalls. ""And he says, 'Have you heard of Elmer Bernstein?' And my jaw hits the floor. I mean, this guy had written some of my favorite melodies, ever.""

The late Elmer Bernstein was one of the founding fathers of Hollywood film scoring, whose music helped define such classics as The Magnificent Seven and To Kill a Mockingbird.

""Elmer had a sailboat,"" McCreary says. ""Every summer he would take it up to Alaska and come back down, and he kept his boat in Bellingham Harbor. Joe Coons ran the local boat club. That's how I met Elmer Bernstein. And I ended up working for Elmer for seven to 10 years.""

McCreary learned some crucial lessons from Bernstein  including to always start a film with a unique sound.

""He always said that you have anywhere from two to 10 seconds to get the audience's attention,"" he says, ""before they become distracted by the story, the titles, the narrative, the acting.""

And, McCreary says, Bernstein was good at following his own rules. ""To Kill a Mockingbird starts with this very childlike piano that could be played with one finger,"" he explains. ""Walk on the Wild Side starts with a triangle solo.""

YouTube

Bernstein himself provided another example when he spoke to Fresh Air in 1991, about the exodus scene in Cecil B. DeMille's epic The Ten Commandments.

""When we realized that a shofar was going to be seen on the screen, we had to find somebody to play the shofar,"" Bernstein said. ""And for those who don't know, the shofar is a very ancient instrument made out of a ram's horn. Well, who plays shofars, of course? Rabbis. Because it's still used in Jewish ceremonies. We must have had, oh, I guess 20 or 30 rabbis on the scoring stage.""

McCreary wanted to draw on that lesson when he got the assignment to score 10 Cloverfield Lane.

""I wrote a theme for the main character, and I had it played on a Middle Eastern instrument called the yayl tambur,"" he says. ""And the next day I went into Bad Robot to play it for the director, Dan Trachtenberg, and producer J.J. Abrams. And the lights went down, those stars from the Paramount logo start floating in, and the yayl tambur starts playing.""

It turns out, Bernstein's advice paid off.

""J.J. turns to me and goes, 'That's really cool! What is that?'"" McCreary says. ""And I smiled, because I thought, 'Elmer was totally right.'""

It turns out 10 Cloverfield Lane's director Dan Trachtenberg was a huge fan of McCreary's music for Battlestar Galactica. Trachtenberg says there are many scores that, while he appreciates for what they do for a movie, he wouldn't necessarily want to listen to. But McCreary's work is different.

""He wrote things that I really just liked the sound of,"" he says. ""And I was excited to work with him, knowing that what I would get would be something that I would really find moving and beautiful to listen to.""

McCreary says he feels lucky to be writing music for a living. Finding joy in his work is something else Elmer Bernstein taught him.

""Elmer showed me that it was possible to succeed in art and in an industry and in a business, and still have a family, still have happiness, still take time for yourself,"" he says. ""All the other tricks of the trade and business that I picked up over the last 10 years have been great, but I feel like my life was set on the right path when I crossed paths with him.""",[]

The religion of Islam was founded by Muhammad, the 7th century prophet whom Muslims call ""the messenger of God.""

They don't consider him divine, but they follow his teachings closely. Good Muslims are taught to emulate the prophet in all matters, personal, spiritual and worldly.

Perhaps no time in recent history has it been more important to do as the Prophet Muhammad did  and not as someone says he did.

With terror groups like ISIS now invoking his name, many Muslim leaders say radicals who cite the prophet to justify violence misrepresent his teachings.

Some Muslim leaders argue that young Muslims need a firmer grounding in their own faith and the prophetic tradition, both to equip them better to counter religious propagandists and also to bind them more closely to Islam.

i toggle caption Courtesy of CelebrateMercy Courtesy of CelebrateMercy

Most of what is known about how Muhammad lived is set down in the Hadith, which consist of recollections of the prophet's life by his companions, first passed on orally and later put down in writing. Taken together, they constitute what Muslims call the ""tradition.""

One effort to promote religious literacy among young Muslims is the CelebrateMercy initiative. Sheikh Hassan Lachheb, a Moroccan-born Islamic scholar from Knoxville, Tenn.  along with a slate of guest speakers  conducts a series of lectures around the country, titled ""Portrait of a Prophet.""

He reads selections from the Hadith, some of them apparently mundane stories about how Muhammad lived, and explains what young Muslims can learn from them. (Click the audio link above to hear the full story.)

Even what seems like the most trivial detail  what kind of sandal he wore, for instance  serves a purpose: humanizing Muhammad, making it easier for Muslims to emulate him.

Hassan argues that if Muslims had more knowledge of how the Prophet Muhammad actually lived and what he taught, they would be less vulnerable to extremist propaganda. Counterterrorism officials  who've focused largely on surveillance, sting operations and community policing  would have more success countering extremism, he says, if they supported efforts to deepen religious literacy among young Muslims.

He cites the abundance of examples from the Hadith that emphasize charity and respect for other faiths.

The tradition associated with the Prophet Muhammad, Hassan says, ""has never been radicalized and has always produced beauty, always produced involvement in the community, always produced tolerance.""

""If you're bypassing all of that to come with a political solution (to extremism),"" Hassan says, ""I don't think it's going to work.""

Below are a few lessons from the life of Muhammad.

The Lifestyle Of The Prophet

Among Muhammad's favorite foods were dates, melon and cucumbers. He enjoyed cool, sweet drinks, including a type of date juice, often mixed with milk and honey. His followers often brought him food from their gardens. He always sent them home with a gift in return.

The prophet is said to have had a thick head of hair and wore it long. It was gray on the sides, and like many men he oiled it with a henna-like product that gave it a reddish tint. The streets were often filled with dust and to keep his oiled hair protected, he often wore a scarf on his head, like a bandanna.

Before going to sleep each night, the prophet would blow on his hands. Even in his sleep, he could be heard blowing. It was not a snoring sound. He normally slept on his right side.

The Significance

The Hadith contain many narrations about the Prophet Muhammad's personal appearance and habits. Muslims are encouraged to learn about these apparently trivial aspects of his story, because it helps them feel more connected to him.

""One of the things we're taught is that we should love the prophet, not just intellectually but experientially,"" says Dalia Mogahed, a guest speaker at a Celebrate Mercy course held in Maryland recently. ""How do we do that without detailed information  the way he walked, the way, he stood, the way he looked. It's about imagining who he was.""

Hassan, the sheikh, reminds his students that the prophet lived in a particular time in Arabia. Some of the things he did and said should be understood in their cultural and historical context, such as how many wives he had and at what age they were betrothed.

Guidance For Daily Life

Muhammad and his family ate a type of bread made with barley. He often gave the bread away before sharing it with his family. By the time he distributed it in his household, the bread was sometimes as hard as a rock. He would dip the bread in water to soften it, but there was not much to go around. The prophet's family did not have their fill of barley bread until after he passed away.

The prophet preached that living a life of ascetism and poverty does not mean one has to be scruffy. He often told his companions to bathe and sometimes admonished them for not cleaning their fingernails or brushing their teeth or combing their hair. Not being clean, he said, affects one's spiritual state.

The prophet was never obscene in speech nor boisterous. He did not find fault in people. When he was angry with someone, he simply turned away. When he was happy, he lowered his gaze. When he laughed, he flashed his white teeth.

The Significance

Some of the Hadith offer Muslims guidance for their daily lives. Moaz Hayat, 18, a student at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., says one lesson he took from the course about the prophet is that he should take better care of his body, as the prophet did.

""He was a very well-built man,"" Hayat says. ""He wasn't just a scholar sitting in an ivory tower.""

Sheikh Hassan uses the story of the prophet's aversion to profanity to tell his students that ""obscenity is not cool. We have to teach our children this,"" he said. ""I'm sorry, but I'm talking from experience in the immigrant community. Too many think it's cool to say stuff like the N-word. It's not fun. We have to combat it. We do have racism in our community.""

A Lesson On Inclusion And Politics

When Muhammad moved to Medina from Mecca, he found it to be a far more cosmopolitan city, with a large and thriving Jewish community. In Medina, the prophet followed many Jewish habits, even if they differed from what the Muslims did. The Jews, for example, wore their hair in a distinctive style, and the prophet changed his hair style in Medina to match theirs.

The Significance

The Prophet Muhammad ""wanted the Jews to feel close,"" Hassan, the sheikh, says. ""They were 'People of the Book,' (from the Abrahamic tradition and whose beliefs are based on a holy text).""

Elaborating on the story, Mogahed  who studies Muslim-American communities as director of research at the Institute for Social Policy and Understanding  says it showed the prophet ""wanted to lessen the barrier between Muslims and Jews. He wanted to connect with them.""

This was a story, she says, with implications for how Muslim-Americans should see their role in U.S. society.

""What this means is, we have to understand the culture and the context we live in,"" she says. ""We should do all that we can to connect to people and respect their culture.""",[]

Mischa Berlinski's Haiti is a terrible place. His Haiti is a beautiful place. In his new novel, Peacekeeping, Haiti is either the best or the worst place, all depending on the day, the moment, the observer.

But what Haiti is most of all is compelling. Addicting. For his characters it's the kind of place that inspires an almost mystical obsession. Like the expatriate judge returning to the place of his birth. The journalist. The former Florida cop turned U.N. worker named Terry White who has decided that Haiti, for all its flaws, is the place where he can make his mark. Where he can finally do some good after failing in so many other attempts. Maybe...

""Terry likes to tell himself a lot of stories,"" says Kay, Terry's wife, late in the novel. ""I guess all men do. Women are different  we have to be, we have to live with you people. A man will tell himself he's building a road. Or saving an orphan from a burning building... And if the story is good enough, a man will tell himself it's okay to go to bed at night. But truth is, men don't have a clue. Terry doesn't even know why he gets out of bed in the morning. But I sure know why I do.""

But to begin: Mischa Berlinski (the guy who wrote Fieldwork, which was probably the best missionaries-and-prison-suicide book of 2007) is telling the story of Terry White in Haiti, as seen through the eyes of an unnamed narrator  a journalist-turned-aspiring-novelist who befriends Terry and Kay during a very odd time in Haiti and all of their lives. There's Terry, Kay, who was a real estate agent (and Vicodin addict) crushed by the U.S. financial collapse. There's judge Johel Celestin, an American-educated Haitian who fled the Duvaliers as a boy, then returned, and Johel's wife, Nadia, who is like a phantom  tiny, quiet, beautiful, powerful  and becomes an object of obsession for Terry because Terry is a good man who can't seem to help but do bad.

Honestly, though, that's too simple a description for a Mischa Berlinski character because Berlinski operates in a world where the gray middles of everything (choices, declarations, morality) far outspace the black and white at the margins. Terry is a good man (who, while a Florida deputy sheriff, used to buy Christmas presents for the children of the men he'd locked up), but a terrible husband (who cheats on and half-abandons Kay). He is a man who wants to help the Haitian people (by trying to get Johel Celestin elected as a senator in place of the corrupt incumbent), but is doing it because he has been defeated in his own battles  having lost his career and his home in a vain attempt at playing in the Big Leagues of Florida politics. He is a broken man. Lost, even if he doesn't quite know it, and trying desperately to rediscover himself in Haiti.

And all of this  the politics, the connections, the battle  is really nothing but an attempt to get a road built between the small town of Jeremie (where much of the novel's action takes place) and Port-au-Prince (where the rest of it does). Terry wants the road built. Johel runs for senator on a pledge of getting the road built. The road is important.

""A mango tree is for a small peasant like a little money machine: a mango tree and a road are school fees for your child; a mango tree and a road, and your wife has prenatal care... A mango tree without a road is a pile of fruit...And what happens to the mangoes now? They fall to the ground and rot  the pigs eat the mangoes and the kids go hungry. And why is that? Because there is no road.""

But even that story would, I think, be too simple for Berlinski. The financial crisis, corruption, the downward spiral of morality, a road and mango trees  not enough. Because there's also riots, race, religion, the relationship between Kay and the unnamed writer (who, as in Fieldwork where it was more overt, is a stand-in for Berlinski himself who once followed his own U.N.-employed wife to Haiti), the 2010 earthquake, and the constant juxtaposition of the beauty and ugliness of Haiti, which is hurtling toward disaster despite all the best efforts of those trying to save the country from itself.

Men can content themselves with stories, Kay says, but the women can not. And, ultimately, she is right. It's the earthquake that settles all the action of Peacekeeping  an event beyond the calculations, machinations or good intentions of any man. And in the end?

Well, I won't ruin that for you. But I can say that it all ends with stories  earthquake stories, of course, told by men  and the plans of the women who survived them.

Ask Daniel Haaksman how he cultivated his love for Africa's digital rhythms, and the 47-year-old Berlin producer will tell you of a life supporting beats from around the world. Long before his latest album, African Fabrics, engaged in a dialogue between European club sounds and the music of Angolan kuduro, Mozambican pandza and South African house, Haaksman made a point of introducing gringo clubbers to global dance music.

The 2004 compilation he produced, Rio Baile Funk: Favela Booty Beats, was one of the gateways for the sample-heavy lo-fi streetwise electro-hip-hop of Brazilian favelas; and was instrumental to Haaksman's founding of his label, Man Recordings, which set about releasing music by Brazilian baile funk artists, and by the European and American producers who wanted to collaborate with them. Haaksman's work with global artists stretches as far back as the early '90s, when along with his then-partner Stefan Hantel (better known as Shantel) he began a Frankfurt club night that focused on rhythms from North Africa, the Middle East, and the Balkans (and Brazil)  in short ""a sound distinctively opposing the ruling techno-house of the moment,"" he told me.

With its myriad of drum machines, African Fabrics is far more receptive of those styles, though much of that has to do with how the creative process and the power of influence have changed over the last quarter century  especially as the Internet age has progressed.

""In the African countries I traveled to [while making Fabrics], I was amazed by how globalized these local musical cultures already are,"" says Haaksman, when I reach him by Skype. ""They use elements from rap, from European house, from trap, and mix it up with their own local rhythms and styles. It's not about authenticity in its original context  they want to connect to other cultures through hybridization. And that's what I did with my album.""

Haaksman's album is, in his own words, ""a Berlin take on different music styles that are present in some African countries at the moment."" Its guests are less a product of a survey than of Haaksman following his Portuguese-speaking muse onward from Brazil. He was first invited to Angola to play a festival in 2009; and in its capital Luanda, he became engrossed in kuduro, an up-tempo percussive style first created as a kind of choreography by the dancer Tony Amado as a takeoff of Jean-Claude Van Damme's moves in the film Kickboxer  and which translates to ""hard-ass.""

Mikhail Lesin, the former Russian press minister and aide to President Vladimir Putin who was found dead in a Washington, D.C., hotel last November, died from blunt force injuries, according to a new report from the chief medical examiner's office.

It's the first time an official cause of death has been announced in the case. When Lesin died four months ago, Russian media outlets reported that the cause was a heart attack, citing family members.

The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Washington says that blunt force injuries to his head killed Lesin, with other contributing causes listed as blunt force injuries to his ""neck, torso, upper extremeties and lower extremeties.""

Under the entry for manner of death, the medical examiner wrote, ""Undetermined.""

In response to the medical examiner's statement, Russian officials said that they have repeatedly sought information about the investigation into Lesin's death at a hotel in Washington's Dupont Circle neighborhood on Nov. 5.

""But the US side has not provided us with any substantive information,"" Russia's Foreign Ministry official spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. ""We are waiting for clarification from Washington and the relevant official details on the progress of the investigation.""



Police in Washington say they have an active investigation into the death of Lesin, an influential media executive who until early 2015 ran Russia's largest media holding, Gazprom-Media. He worked under Putin for roughly 10 years from 1999 to 2009, first as a press minister and then as an adviser.

Russia Today, the English-language TV and online media outlet, has repeatedly cited Lesin as the man who came up with the idea of establishing the state-run network.

Lesin's death also brought out memories of his long career in Russia, with Sputnik News highlighting his allegiance to former President Boris Yeltsin  and his rumored role in creating a secret video recording that created a storm of scandal around a prosecutor who was investigating Yeltsin's family over allegations of corruption.

When Yeltsin left office, Lesin stayed; he is seen as the man responsible for placing several large TV and other media outlets, such as NTV, under Putin's central control in 2000.

The death of Lesin prompted many conspiracy theories, which variously implicate Putin, the CIA, and, in some corners, Mossad. Early efforts in Russia to describe the cause of death as a heart attack added to the suspicions  and so did reports that Lesin might somehow have been compromised by money-laundering allegations raised by a U.S. senator who claimed Lesin had ""bought homes worth a total of $28 [million] in Los Angeles and moved his immediate family there,"" as The Financial Times reported.

Immediately after Lesin died, the authorities released only the most basic information. From The Washington Post's initial report on his death:",[]

That might be the lyrical message of ""Gravity Don't Pull Me,"" a new song by the songwriter and producer Rostam Batmanglij, who recently left his longtime day job in Vampire Weekend, but he insists that's not the whole story. ""I want people to hear the song as ultimately having a positive message,"" he said in an interview with NPR, ""of learning from your mistakes.""

""Gravity Don't Pull Me"" is the first time fans will see Batmanglij singing solo, front and center. The video, which he co-directed with Josh Goleman, is stark, focused on just Batmanglij, a microphone and two modern dancers  Jack Grabow and Sam Asa Pratt  in an empty room. Batmanglij sings about the ""worst things [he] ever did"" and the boy who broke his heart over an oscillating analog synthesizer while centered between Grabow and Pratt. He says he has wanted to make a dance video for about five years, and was inspired to work with Grabow after seeing a dance video he made for the Vampire Weekend song ""I Think Ur A Contra."" Batmanglij says he was proud of the rhythms he wrote for that song, and was impressed with how well Grabow's dance embodied them. So when he finished writing ""Gravity Don't Pull Me"" years later, he immediately thought to ask Grabow to choreograph a dance video for it. Grabow pulled in Pratt, who he knew from high school. Coincidentally, Batmanglij also knew of Pratt; he had seen a dance video Pratt made for the song ""Osaka Loop Line,"" which Batmanglij produced as part of the band Discovery.

Batmanglij describes both the song and the idea for the video as coming to him in insistent moments of inspiration  he says he was ""pretty much possessed by the song"" as he was writing it and knew he wanted the video to be an expression of symmetry. At first, even he didn't understand that impulse. But both of Batmanglij's parents are from Iran, and eventually he realized he was drawing inspiration from the symmetry of Persian rugs. ""I think it was a subconscious thing,"" he says. For most of the video, Grabow and Pratt dance as mirror images of each other. At certain moments, however, the two break from each other and dance independently. Batmanglij says Grabow and Pratt left moments open for improvisation when they choreographed the piece. The result is the striking imagery of two people falling perpetually in and out of sync with each other in a way that mirrors the song's heartsick lyrics: ""So I bite my lip and I hold my tongue / And I wait for the pain to stop / But some days I still let you back in.""

For Batmanglij, the lyrics, music and visual imagery are meant to inform one another. ""I hope there's something bigger that lives between all those things interacting with each other,"" he says. ""For me, the idea of writing a song, recording it, making a video  it's like, you go around the moon and you come back. You accomplish everything there was to accomplish ... It feels like telling the whole story.""",[]

toggle caption Keith Bernstein/Bleecker Street

Helen Mirren says she hopes her new film ""doesn't cause any divorces."" That's because Eye in the Sky raises some very tricky moral questions. Mirren plays a UK-based colonel overseeing a secret drone operation in Kenya. Her mission is to capture a terrorist target, but when it becomes clear the target is assembling a suicide vest for an imminent attack, the question becomes whether to capture or kill.

The decision is anything but clear-cut: The suicide bomber is in the sights of a drone flying overhead. But the strike that could take him out might also kill an innocent girl nearby. Is the life of one girl more important than the lives of those who could be killed if the bomber isn't stopped? What should the generals half a world away do?

""I think of it as a courtroom drama in a way,"" Mirren tells NPR's David Greene. ""The audience are the jury. ... As people come out of the cinema there will be a lot of discussion. ... It takes no sides.""

Director Gavin Hood says every character in the film approaches the situation with his or her own truth. ""The audience is sitting watching multiple characters involved in this operation, all of whom have very different agendas,"" he says. ""There is no easy answer to this.""

Hood and Mirren joined Greene to talk about whether working on the film changed their feelings about drones, and to remember Mirren's Eye in the Sky co-star, Alan Rickman, who died in January.

Interview Highlights

On forcing the audience to grapple with big moral questions

Gavin Hood: I think what Guy [Hibbert]'s script does so well is he draws most of the audience into a situation where they're ready to pull a trigger, and then he asks: Are you sure you're ready to pull the trigger? Should you pull the trigger? Even if you think you should pull the trigger are there broader political implications and so on that might make you pause?

My parents lived in the war during the blitz and they experienced the German bombers coming overhead and dropping bombs on London. ... . You just prayed for it to carry on over your head and go and drop the payload on someone else.

On personal feelings about drones

Helen Mirren: My parents lived in the war during the blitz and they experienced the German bombers coming overhead and dropping bombs on London. My mother said by far the worst was what was known as the Doodlebug  which were unmanned drones, if you like, early, early drones. ... You heard it coming and it made this ""wuuuuuuuuuuuu"" noise and she said the most terrifying thing was when that noise stopped: Because when it stopped it meant it was dropping its payload. And you just prayed for it to carry on over your head and go and drop the payload on someone else. You didn't really care who the other person was, you just didn't want it to drop on your head.

I don't know what I think ... the technology is one thing, the use and how we use the technology, and where we use the technology is a very different thing.

On a more recent experience with a drone

HM: I was at a wedding recently and they had a drone up, taking photos ... hovering, making this horrible noise. ... And all of the people in the wedding hated this drone even though it was there for a super benign reason; we all loathed the drone. ... And then the drone accidentally crashed and fell and everybody at the wedding put up a huge cheer. Everyone was so thrilled that the drone was out of the sky.

Can you imagine living in a world where that drone is there on a daily basis and it's not benign and it doesn't belong to you? ... I can't imagine living in that world, it must be so disturbing.

On sacrificing one life for the good of many

HM: The appalling moral issue that we've been struggling with as human beings for millions of years is: Do you sacrifice one for the greater good ... one life for 20 lives, for 200 lives, for 500 lives? We know about the little girl [near the suicide bomber] in this movie ... we're not personally involved with the children that might die in the shopping mall on that same day [if the suicide bomber isn't taken out by the drone]. And maybe if we're following one of their stories our whole attitude would change ... and that's sort of the wonder of being a human being and the awfulness of being a human being  we're only really involved in what we're aware of.

So if we want to become better at what we do as a society  be more just  people who operate in different areas of expertise have to talk to each other as opposed to pushing out propagandist information that the other side simply ignores.

On saying goodbye to costar Alan Rickman

HM: The reason I think Alan would love this film  and the reason I love to see Alan in this film  is because it's Alan up there. His elegance, his articulation, his fierce intelligence, and his humanity. And it's absolutely Alan that I recognize up on that screen.

i toggle caption YouTube YouTube

Employers want to hire the best and the brightest to get the job done.

So do terrorist groups.

In Africa, terrorist groups are actively recruiting well-educated boys and girls. The groups want recruits who can be leaders, who know how to give orders, who can boost the brand on social media.

One Kenyan teacher is fighting back  and his efforts have made him a candidate for the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize, which comes with a $1 million award.

His name is Ayub Mohamud. A business studies teacher at Eastleigh Boys School in Nairobi, he's the Somali-Kenyan founder of a group called Teachers Against Violent Extremism. The goal is to teach high school students how to rebuff recruiters from terrorist groups.

""These extremist groups, they like young men who are educated,"" says Mohamud. ""Like in the Garissa University Attack. ""

In the attack by Al-Shabaab on Garissa University last year in Kenya's Northeast, 147 students were killed. One of the lead gunmen was a graduate of Nairobi's top law school.

""He was educated, he was university student, he had done law,"" Mohamud says. The terrorist groups ""want someone who understands ... someone to give instructions.""

So recruitment tactics are changing. The suspected terrorist recruiter who approached 18-year-old Abdulahi Meyow did not talk of holy jihad or the pleasures of an afterlife for those who die in the line of battle. He offered money: $50 dollars if Abdulahi would do a project.

""He just said that I have this project whereby you can actually gain money for your family,"" says Meyow.

The fifth year of the Syrian conflict was the worst yet for civilians  and Russia, the U.S., France and Britain are partly to blame. That's according to a new report from 30 aid and human rights groups, including Oxfam and Care International.

Titled ""Fuelling the Fire,"" the report says some 50,000 people have been killed since April 2014 and that nearly a million more have been forced to flee their homes. It also says that as permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, the U.S., Britain, France and Russia could be doing much more to end the bloodshed.

While fixing most of the blame on the Syrian regime and armed opposition groups, as well as violent extremists such as the Islamic State, the report says major world powers are undermining their own calls for peace through the weapons they provide to combatants, their own military strikes and what the report calls inadequate pressure on their allies to stop the killing.

Russia comes in for blame for its deadly air campaign, and for failing to stop its Syrian ally from using sieges and starvation as weapons of war.

Jan Egeland with the Norwegian Refugee Council, one of the groups behind the report, said this week in Geneva that despite recent progress in aiding besieged areas, there are still seven places where they can't get aid to trapped people.

""It's very clear that the seven areas where we have not reached, are [controlled]  six by the government, one by Islamic State,"" he said. ""The two areas [controlled] by armed opposition groups in the north and Idlib, we have been able to service those.""

Reason for hope did appear on the horizon just as this report was being finalized. A fragile cease-fire has allowed aid to reach some besieged areas in Syria, and problematic peace talks could resume in Geneva as early as Monday.

The authors of the report acknowledge that Russia and the U.S. in particular deserve credit for this progress, but they add that the ""tremendous test"" now facing them is to get their allies to keep their guns quiet while diplomats strive for a more enduring cessation of hostilities.",[]

In the aftermath of an eventful Black History Month and in the midst Women's History Month, Chimurenga Renaissance's ""Girlz With Gunz"" feels incredibly appropriate for the time in which it was released. It's the title cut from the experimental hip-hop duo's recently released EP, a project inspired by and dedicated to ""revolutionary African women.""

And by ""African,"" vocalist/ multi-instrumentalist Tendai ""Baba"" Maraire (of Shabazz Palaces) and guitarist Hussein Kalonji mean both women from the continent and those who are part of the diaspora. Invoking names like Nehanda (Nehanda Charwe Nyakasikan) and Afeni (Afeni Shakur) they celebrate black women who have fought oppression throughout history  ""chimurenga"" is a Shona word meaning ""struggle"" and the name of 19th century revolt against British colonizers in what is now Zimbabwe.

There's a Pan-Africanist through-line present in Chimurenga Renaissance's creations that not only informs their lyrics, but the very music itself. Maraire and Kalonji are the American-born sons of lauded musicians from Zimbabwe and Congo respectively  and their own compositions bring together traditional instruments like the mbira, with the modern, synthesized sounds of the West. The result is a trans-Atlantic melange of melodies, polyrhythms, glitches, and distortion.

On ""Girlz With Gunz,"" they use all these sounds to construct a song in praise of black women and a pledge of devotion. Keep their sonic spectrum broad, Maraire and Kalonji celebrate the black woman in her various incarnations from celebrity to soldier. A revolutionary African woman need not carry a pistol to make her presence felt and she certainly doesn't have to be beholden to a patriarchal society's standards in order to be respected or revered. One time, for the ""girlz with gunz.""

i toggle caption YouTube YouTube

Employers want to hire the best and the brightest to get the job done.

So do terrorist groups.

In Africa, terrorist groups are actively recruiting well-educated boys and girls. The groups want recruits who can be leaders, who know how to give orders, who can boost the brand on social media.

One Kenyan teacher is fighting back  and his efforts have made him a candidate for the Varkey Foundation Global Teacher Prize, which comes with a $1 million award.

His name is Ayub Mohamud. A business studies teacher at Eastleigh Boys School in Nairobi, he's the Somali-Kenyan founder of a group called Teachers Against Violent Extremism. The goal is to teach high school students how to rebuff recruiters from terrorist groups.

""These extremist groups, they like young men who are educated,"" says Mohamud. ""Like in the Garissa University Attack. ""

In the attack by Al-Shabaab on Garissa University last year in Kenya's Northeast, 147 students were killed. One of the lead gunmen was a graduate of Nairobi's top law school.

""He was educated, he was university student, he had done law,"" Mohamud says. The terrorist groups ""want someone who understands ... someone to give instructions.""

So recruitment tactics are changing. The suspected terrorist recruiter who approached 18-year-old Abdulahi Meyow did not talk of holy jihad or the pleasures of an afterlife for those who die in the line of battle. He offered money: $50 dollars if Abdulahi would do a project.

""He just said that I have this project whereby you can actually gain money for your family,"" says Meyow.

Meyow wasn't told what the project was. He was told that he was singled out because he's a good student, ""a head boy, I can see you're working hard."" He's captain of his high school class at Eastleigh Boys School.

""First I thought  let me do it,"" Meyow says. But the 18-year-old didn't know what the project was. And he had enough doubts to ask his parents for advice.

If you follow Team PCHH on Twitter, you know that a week ago, we all trekked up to Manhattan and saw Hamilton, which we intended to talk about on this week's show. Unfortunately, I was struck down by the weirdest and most potent bout of laryngitis of my lifetime, and we had to postpone that show, which you'll get next week. In the meantime, fortunately, we have three conversations featuring awesome people who have never been on PCHH before. Fresh faces!

First, we're bringing you a conversation that NPR Music's Daoud Tyler-Ameen had with Leslie Odom, Jr. late last year. Odom plays Aaron Burr in Hamilton, and they get deeply into issues of performance and risk and interpreting a living writer's material. We just love this chat and we're crazy about Daoud (and Leslie Odom, Jr., obviously), and it's almost worth being sick all week to bring these two guys to you.

The other two chats are from the same New York field trip where we saw Hamilton, when I dropped into the NPR bureau up there and brought in a bunch of really smart people to talk about the things that are on their minds, pop-culturally speaking. (You'll hear that I was already losing my voice and it sounds a little scratchy  sorry!) Earlier this week, we released a conversation I had about American Crime with culture writer Danielle Henderson, and if you missed it, here it is.

In this episode, you'll first hear Sean Rameswaram, a host at WNYC who did the great great (and now concluded) podcast Sideshow. Sean wanted to talk about Kanye West and The Life Of Pablo, so we did. He's got thoughts on what it's like to be a Kanye fan, how the unconventional album release plays into remix culture, and lots more.

Finally, I sat down with Daisy Rosario, of Latino USA, to talk about the upcoming Netflix reboot of Gilmore Girls. Daisy wasn't a fan when the show was first running, but she formed one of those molecular-level bonds with it, particularly after realizing how much she had in common with Rory Gilmore. I reference, by the way, an episode of Latino USA that I highly recommend, and you can find it in their archive.

We've got more to come from the field trip, so stay tuned in the coming weeks, and next week, we really will talk about Hamilton.",[]

i toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Wilfredo Lee/AP

After one more debate among the Republican contenders for president, the postgame conversation was once again dominated by Donald Trump's behavior.

But for once, it was about his good behavior. He did not shout or fulminate, nor did he pout or belittle his opponents or joust with the moderators.

In fact, after an even dozen of these events, all four remaining candidates kept a remarkably even keel at the University of Miami. Their previous two meetings had been rife with personal attacks that, at times, became almost juvenile, but on this night all four seemed intent on elevating the tone and tending to business.

The themes of the night were almost entirely policy oriented, with a few forays into political process and tiffs over who was doing better or more likely to win in November if nominated.

The two-hour debate was shown on CNN and co-sponsored by the Salem Media Group and The Washington Times. And although there is at least one more debate scheduled in Salt Lake City on March 21, the Miami event had the feeling of a finale.

The moderators began with a long discussion of job creation, which segued into trade, visas for high-tech workers, Social Security, the national debt, Obamacare, education policy, Common Core and, of course, immigration.

Much of the attention was on Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, who have together amassed more than 800 delegates to date. But both Marco Rubio and John Kasich, who face do-or-die primaries in their home states on Tuesday, had ample opportunity to defend their place in the race.

Trump, as has been typical, got most of the air time, with more than 27 minutes. Cruz and Rubio followed with a little under 22 minutes each, Kasich with less than 19.

Rubio and Kasich delivered solid reprises of their strongest debate moments to date, as if to say that if this was going to be their last outing, they would at least be at their best. Rubio, most notably, was once again the smooth and earnest spokesman for a new American dream, sharp on the issue details and long on the idealistic overtures. It was easier to understand why his expectations had been so high than to understand his third- and fourth-place finishes.

""For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation,"" Rubio said. ""And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way. If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived.""

Kasich had this to say near the end of the debate:

""I have run an unwavering, positive campaign for president of the United States. ... Sometimes being positive isn't all that interesting, but it's very interesting to my family, my children and so many supporters that I meet all across the country, and I will continue to run a positive campaign.""

In essence, though, both Rubio and Kasich trail so far behind in the delegate count that they are at this point running for influence at the convention and a prospective vice presidential bid. Either might make a classic running mate with high name recognition and campaign experience.

Florida is the largest swing state in the Electoral College, and no Republican has ever won the White House without winning Ohio.

Cruz, who has been Trump's closest competitor thus far, returned several times to the difference between talking about problems and knowing how to solve them.

""Donald is right,"" Cruz said, gesturing toward Trump. ""For example, he was just talking about international trade. He's right about the problems. But his solutions don't work. So, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods. Now, he backed away from that immediately, and he may come back with a different number tonight.""

At another point, Cruz referred to his rival as ""a candidate who has been funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment,"" adding that ""it's very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington.""

Trump was once again the man in the middle. But he was markedly different in playing the central role. He found a deft way, when discussing education, to mention that former rival candidate Ben Carson would be endorsing him the next day (an important coup given Carson's image, aura and remaining bloc of voters).

As ever, Trump pushed back when others pushed him, but without the ferocity seen in earlier debates. Questioned about how he could get tough on trade and immigration when his businesses brought in foreign workers and made products overseas, Trump responded calmly and firmly:

""Because nobody knows the system better than me. ... I'm a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. ... So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this stage knows how to change it like I do, believe me.""

Challenged over a protester who was beaten at one of Trump's rallies this week, Trump said he did not condone such behavior. But he also said some of the disturbances at his events were caused by ""bad dudes"" who had been violent and disruptive, and added a salute to the local police, who he said had handled these situations well and deserved more support and respect.

The elevated tone of the Miami debate may have reflected the seriousness of the contest at this juncture. Tuesday brings the second biggest prize of the season: 99 delegates in the winner-take-all state of Florida. It is widely believed that Rubio must win his home state or fold his tent. Also winner-take-all is Ohio, where the same imperative hangs over incumbent Gov. Kasich.

But the other three states voting, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri, rank fifth, 10th and 18th by population and size of convention delegations. Taken together, the five states on March 15 offer nearly as many delegates as were available on Super Tuesday, March 1.

At one point in the debate, the candidates were asked what they would do if none of them had the 1,237 delegates needed for a first ballot nomination.

Trump said he expected to have enough on the first ballot, adding that if he did not he would expect to support whichever candidate had the most. He called on the others to promise as much:",[]

Temporary is lasting a long time for evacuees in neat blocks of pre-fabricated housing in Fukushima city. The wood siding on their tiny homes looks new. But these trailers are stretching into their fifth year of use.

Saki Sato, 77, shows me around her home, where she lives alone in a kind of limbo. Each room she describes is about the size of a king sized mattress.

She is among the nearly 60,000 Japanese who still find themselves in temporary trailer homes after having to flee five years ago following a magnitude 9 earthquake on March 11, 2011. The tremor unleashed a tsunami that reached 128 feet and caused a nuclear disaster that contaminated soil with radiation in a large patch of surrounding territory.

Her former village of Iitate is in the radiation evacuation zone. It's still not safe to return. On her wall along the narrow entrance in her temporary home are photos of loved ones. Her son. His kids. That's where her extended evacuation hits her the hardest.

""I used to see my son regularly,"" she says. ""But now he doesn't come to visit. It's too exhausting for him to come this far to visit. It's really hard.""

Of the estimated 19,000 who died in the disaster, most drowned within minutes. The tsunami also shut down the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant's cooling system. It triggered meltdowns in three of its nuclear reactors that spread radiation plumes as far as 25 miles away.

""Many, so many, lessons learned,"" says Yuichi Okamura, a spokesman at TEPCO  the Tokyo Electric Power Company  which owns the plant.

Government and outside investigations show TEPCO missed several opportunities to prevent the meltdown. Now prosecutors may hold TEPCO leaders criminally responsible. It criminally indicted its former chairman and other leaders just weeks ago, charging that they didn't act soon enough to inform the public a meltdown had happened.

Inside TEPCO's Tokyo offices today, the company says it's trying to look forward.

""Our organization ... we have to improve the mindset itself. We have to change, we have to improve. We can improve,"" says Okamura.

Next month, the plant will begin a decommissioning process that will take 40 years. At the government level, the cost of decontaminating houses and farmland in Fukushima prefecture alone carries a $50 billion price tag.

Recovery involves rebuilding roads, bridges and power lines. It also means helping re-house many of those still displaced by the storm. Officials have already missed various deadlines for re-housing evacuees. Part of the problem is competition for construction workers and materials. Japan's government isn't just rebuilding the coast, it's also readying itself for the 2020 Olympics.

Fukushima prefecture, only one of several Japanese prefectures affected by the disasters, estimates it's only about halfway to its decontamination and recovery goals.

""In terms of infrastructure, our recovery has been quite fast, I would say,"" says Hatsuo Fujishima, director of general affairs of the Fukushima prefecture government. He's in charge of recovery efforts for the prefecture.

""The difference in Fukushima is the radiation problem. Radiation takes a long time to disappear,"" Fujishima says.

When it is safe to go home again, there's also the issue of what people would return to. Communities, schools, businesses that once existed are no longer there.

toggle caption Kosuke Okahara for NPR

One business forced by radiation to relocate is Ebisu-An, a family-owned restaurant specializing in freshly-made udon noodles. These days, Hiroshi Takahashi and his mom and dad are working in a cramped kitchen in a location far from the coast, in Fukushima city.

After the village was evacuated, they opened in Fukushima city and it became a gathering place for Iitate village evacuees who wanted a sense of home, hundreds of miles from their home. But the bonds of the village have since frayed.

Takahashi says while many villagers showed up here in the immediate aftermath of the triple tragedy, he doesn't see that many of them anymore. But he should be able to move the business back to Iitate next year. Leaders in charge of the clean-up are re-opening parts of Iitate in March 2017 following years of decontamination.

""It's a little complicated emotion I'm feeling,"" he says of the prospect of returning to the village. ""Because even if I go back to Iitate, I'm not sure how many Iitate refugees will also come back.""

That's the big question  after all the effort and money spent on reconstruction  when can evacuees return, and will they want to?

i toggle caption Kosuke Okahara for NPR Kosuke Okahara for NPR

Rebuilding has taken so long and public safety fears are so entrenched that the Fukushima government estimates half of the evacuees may never return. In other villages that have been deemed safe, the return rate has been far less than that 50 percent estimate.

In the neighborhoods of temporary housing, Sato, the 77-year-old, and other elderly residents have a routine. Afternoon teas, flower arrangement classes, walks with neighbors.

""Also, my friends are living here now,"" she says.

She doesn't know if she'll ever go home to the village. Five years after a forced evacuation, Sato and thousands of others just like her are still in limbo.

Imagine the worst opera singer ever. Now imagine that she's determined to perform in public. That's the premise of an award-winning French satire that's based on a true story. It's called Marguerite, and it follows a middle-aged socialite by the same name.

Marguerite has very little to do. While the roaring 1920s roar elsewhere and her husband spends all his time with a mistress, Marguerite sits in her Downton Abbey-style mansion outside Paris surrendering her soul to music.

She adores opera, and is wealthy enough that she can sponsor musical recitals for charity with young guest singers. These are invitation-only affairs where her wealthy friends reward her charitable generosity by being charitable about the way she ends the concerts  with her own, shall we say, unique musical stylings. Stylings with no sense of pitch, rhythm or, for that matter, talent.

Marguerite is surrounded by servants who applaud and friends who are polite. (Her husband usually claims car trouble kept him away.) But I hear your question: How could she not know? Wouldn't someone tell her? Here's how it works: After one recital, when a young singer is ushered into Marguerite's presence to say thank you, Marguerite looks up  vulnerable and sweet  and says, ""You heard me miss all my high notes."" The young performer, not wishing to hurt or be impolite, says, ""No, it sounded fine."" Self-knowledge will have to wait.

There were, however, some uninvited guests. A young music critic writes in his paper that Marguerite sang as if she were trying to ""exorcise an inner demon""  innocently, she takes that as praise. There's also an anarchist poet who invites her to perform at a public concert. Marguerite's husband is terrified she'll find out they've all been lying to her, but it's an anarchist performance and she kind of fits right in.

Marguerite's story of misplaced confidence is based loosely on that of Florence Foster Jenkins, an American laughingstock whose ghastly public renditions of some of the same music became a best-selling novelty record in the 1950s. It was called The Glory (????) of the Human Voice.

Meryl Streep will soon play Jenkins in another movie, but it's hard to imagine anyone improving on the mix of hilarity and heartbreak this transplanted, fictional version achieves. As director Xavier Giannoli pushes his leading lady closer and closer to public humiliation, Catherine Frot's Marguerite becomes every bit as haunting as you expect her to be laughable, walking barefoot in the rain after an evening of opera, then squawking in rehearsals like the peacocks that wander her estate's lawn. The more ridiculous Marguerite becomes, the more you want to keep this misguided, innocent, music-besotted creature from being hurt.",[]

Adults in Ohio are divided when it comes to whether they believe the Affordable Care Act has been good or bad for them.

And while most rate their own health care positively, far more Ohioans rate the state's overall health care system as fair or poor than rate it as excellent. Those are some of the findings in a series of recent polls by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Lilo Whittaker, who responded to the poll, lives on a wooded one-acre lot in rural Ohio. The setting is idyllic on a cold winter morning. Chickadees chirp outside and a pot of coffee brews in the kitchen.

toggle caption Sarah Jane Tribble/WCPN

But at nearly 60 years old, Whittaker says the picture isn't perfect. When Whittaker first heard about the federal health overhaul several years ago, she expected it would help.

""I thought, this is great,"" Whittaker says. ""People will be able to afford their health insurance, get decent coverage and begin to take care of their medical issues.""

But, in the past two years, Whittaker says, her husband's Parkinson's medications went from just over $150 a month to more than $400. The couple's health insurance coverage has also become less affordable.

""A lot of people like me will forgo going to a doctor even if they have a problem because you can't even afford your deductible or your copay,"" she says. ""And I don't think your health insurance issues here are addressed properly.""

Whittaker is among the 27 percent in Ohio who say Obamacare has directly hurt them. On the other hand, 21 percent of Ohioans say it has directly helped them.

At the Free Medical Clinic of Greater Cleveland, there is a steady stream of patients on a recent weekday afternoon.

Over the past two years, the clinic has seen a shift in the people it cares for. More of them have coverage, like 29-year-old Whitnie Momah.

toggle caption Sarah Jane Tribble/WCPN

She smiles when asked about her health care insurance. ""I hear a lot of people say that for them it's gotten worse, but for me, it's gotten better,"" Momah says. ""Before I made too much money to qualify for, like, any type of government assistance but not enough money to where I could afford my health insurance.""

Momah is a nursing student. She says she would be uninsured if she hadn't called for help with HealthCare.gov, the federal insurance exchange. They walked her through the site, and she's now enrolled in a low-cost health insurance plan called Buckeye.

""It really helped me out, it really did,"" she says. ""It was a huge blessing for me.""

Momah's experience, as well as Whittaker's, are two different but very real pictures of Ohio, says Robert Blendon, a professor at the Harvard Chan School.

The polarization there is even more extreme than the nation.

""In Ohio, there are shares of people who really feel that they've been helped by the law and changes in recent years,"" Blendon says. ""There are shares of people who actually don't feel they have been helped and actually hurt. And it's not a unified view of what is going on in Ohio. The divisions are really quite large.""

Nearly 900,000 people have gained health care coverage in the past two years in Ohio  about 240,000 with federal marketplace plans and another 650,000 through Ohio's expansion of Medicaid  something Republican Gov. John Kasich did despite his party's opposition.

You can find the detailed results of the national poll here. Results for Ohio are here.

At the same time, people enrolled in employer-sponsored health insurance have seen a steady climb in the amount they pay out of pocket. One analysis shows that by 2014, Ohio was third in the nation for the most people enrolled in high-deductible health plans.

Reem Aly, a researcher with the nonpartisan Health Policy Institute of Ohio, says people tend to blame the Affordable Care Act for the trend toward high-deductible plans.

""It can be a very polarizing issue,"" Aly says. ""Every person has different circumstances and health care can be very personal.""

For Lilo Whittaker, the ACA is a promise left unfulfilled. She questions why some benefit so much and others, like her, don't. It's not fair, she says.

""We just go without. We don't do anything,"" Whittaker says. ""Christmas was kind of depressing for the grandkids because I told them, I couldn't afford to do what I used to be able to do,"" Whittaker says she has always paid her bills.

In the aftermath of an eventful Black History Month and in the midst Women's History Month, Chimurenga Renaissance's ""Girlz With Gunz"" feels incredibly appropriate for the time in which it was released. It's the title cut from the experimental hip-hop duo's recently released EP, a project inspired by and dedicated to ""revolutionary African women.""

And by ""African,"" vocalist/ multi-instrumentalist Tendai ""Baba"" Maraire (of Shabazz Palaces) and guitarist Hussein Kalonji mean both women from the continent and those who are part of the diaspora. Invoking names like Nehanda (Nehanda Charwe Nyakasikan) and Afeni (Afeni Shakur) they celebrate black women who have fought oppression throughout history  ""chimurenga"" is a Shona word meaning ""struggle"" and the name of 19th century revolt against British colonizers in what is now Zimbabwe.

There's a Pan-Africanist through-line present in Chimurenga Renaissance's creations that not only informs their lyrics, but the very music itself. Maraire and Kalonji are the American-born sons of lauded musicians from Zimbabwe and Congo respectively  and their own compositions bring together traditional instruments like the mbira, with the modern, synthesized sounds of the West. The result is a trans-Atlantic melange of melodies, polyrhythms, glitches, and distortion.

On ""Girlz With Gunz,"" they use all these sounds to construct a song in praise of black women and a pledge of devotion. Keep their sonic spectrum broad, Maraire and Kalonji celebrate the black woman in her various incarnations from celebrity to soldier. A revolutionary African woman need not carry a pistol to make her presence felt and she certainly doesn't have to be beholden to a patriarchal society's standards in order to be respected or revered. One time, for the ""girlz with gunz.""

Temporary is lasting a long time for evacuees in neat blocks of pre-fabricated housing in Fukushima city. The wood siding on their tiny homes looks new. But these trailers are stretching into their fifth year of use.

Saki Sato, 77, shows me around her home, where she lives alone in a kind of limbo. Each room she describes is about the size of a king sized mattress.

She is among the nearly 60,000 Japanese who still find themselves in temporary trailer homes after having to flee five years ago following a magnitude 9 earthquake on March 11, 2011. The tremor unleashed a tsunami that reached 128 feet and caused a nuclear disaster that contaminated soil with radiation in a large patch of surrounding territory.

Her former village of Iitate is in the radiation evacuation zone. It's still not safe to return. On her wall along the narrow entrance in her temporary home are photos of loved ones. Her son. His kids. That's where her extended evacuation hits her the hardest.

""I used to see my son regularly,"" she says. ""But now he doesn't come to visit. It's too exhausting for him to come this far to visit. It's really hard.""

Of the estimated 19,000 who died in the disaster, most drowned within minutes. The tsunami also shut down the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant's cooling system. It triggered meltdowns in three of its nuclear reactors that spread radiation plumes as far as 25 miles away.

""Many, so many, lessons learned,"" says Yuichi Okamura, a spokesman at TEPCO  the Tokyo Electric Power Company  which owns the plant.

Government and outside investigations show TEPCO missed several opportunities to prevent the meltdown. Now prosecutors may hold TEPCO leaders criminally responsible. It criminally indicted its former chairman and other leaders just weeks ago, charging that they didn't act soon enough to inform the public a meltdown had happened.

Inside TEPCO's Tokyo offices today, the company says it's trying to look forward.

""Our organization ... we have to improve the mindset itself. We have to change, we have to improve. We can improve,"" says Okamura.

Next month, the plant will begin a decommissioning process that will take 40 years. At the government level, the cost of decontaminating houses and farmland in Fukushima prefecture alone carries a $50 billion price tag.

Recovery involves rebuilding roads, bridges and power lines. It also means helping re-house many of those still displaced by the storm. Officials have already missed various deadlines for re-housing evacuees. Part of the problem is competition for construction workers and materials. Japan's government isn't just rebuilding the coast, it's also readying itself for the 2020 Olympics.

Fukushima prefecture, only one of several Japanese prefectures affected by the disasters, estimates it's only about halfway to its decontamination and recovery goals.

""In terms of infrastructure, our recovery has been quite fast, I would say,"" says Hatsuo Fujishima, director of general affairs of the Fukushima prefecture government. He's in charge of recovery efforts for the prefecture.

""The difference in Fukushima is the radiation problem. Radiation takes a long time to disappear,"" Fujishima says.

When it is safe to go home again, there's also the issue of what people would return to. Communities, schools, businesses that once existed are no longer there.

One business forced by radiation to relocate is Ebisu-An, a family-owned restaurant specializing in freshly-made udon noodles. These days, Hiroshi Takahashi and his mom and dad are working in a cramped kitchen in a location far from the coast, in Fukushima city.

After the village was evacuated, they opened in Fukushima city and it became a gathering place for Iitate village evacuees who wanted a sense of home, hundreds of miles from their home. But the bonds of the village have since frayed.

Takahashi says while many villagers showed up here in the immediate aftermath of the triple tragedy, he doesn't see that many of them anymore. But he should be able to move the business back to Iitate next year. Leaders in charge of the clean-up are re-opening parts of Iitate in March 2017 following years of decontamination.

""It's a little complicated emotion I'm feeling,"" he says of the prospect of returning to the village. ""Because even if I go back to Iitate, I'm not sure how many Iitate refugees will also come back.""

That's the big question  after all the effort and money spent on reconstruction  when can evacuees return, and will they want to?

Rebuilding has taken so long and public safety fears are so entrenched that the Fukushima government estimates half of the evacuees may never return. In other villages that have been deemed safe, the return rate has been far less than that 50 percent estimate.

toggle caption Keith Bernstein/Bleecker Street

Helen Mirren says she hopes her new film ""doesn't cause any divorces."" That's because Eye in the Sky raises some very tricky moral questions. Mirren plays a UK-based colonel overseeing a secret drone operation in Kenya. Her mission is to capture a terrorist target, but when it becomes clear the target is assembling a suicide vest for an imminent attack, the question becomes whether to capture or kill.

The decision is anything but clear-cut: The suicide bomber is in the sights of a drone flying overhead. But the strike that could take him out might also kill an innocent girl nearby. Is the life of one girl more important than the lives of those who could be killed if the bomber isn't stopped? What should the generals half a world away do?

""I think of it as a courtroom drama in a way,"" Mirren tells NPR's David Greene. ""The audience are the jury. ... As people come out of the cinema there will be a lot of discussion. ... It takes no sides.""

Director Gavin Hood says every character in the film approaches the situation with his or her own truth. ""The audience is sitting watching multiple characters involved in this operation, all of whom have very different agendas,"" he says. ""There is no easy answer to this.""

Hood and Mirren joined Greene to talk about whether working on the film changed their feelings about drones, and to remember Mirren's Eye in the Sky co-star, Alan Rickman, who died in January.

Interview Highlights

On forcing the audience to grapple with big moral questions

Gavin Hood: I think what Guy [Hibbert]'s script does so well is he draws most of the audience into a situation where they're ready to pull a trigger, and then he asks: Are you sure you're ready to pull the trigger? Should you pull the trigger? Even if you think you should pull the trigger are there broader political implications and so on that might make you pause?

My parents lived in the war during the blitz and they experienced the German bombers coming overhead and dropping bombs on London. ... . You just prayed for it to carry on over your head and go and drop the payload on someone else.

On personal feelings about drones

Helen Mirren: My parents lived in the war during the blitz and they experienced the German bombers coming overhead and dropping bombs on London. My mother said by far the worst was what was known as the Doodlebug  which were unmanned drones, if you like, early, early drones. ... You heard it coming and it made this ""wuuuuuuuuuuuu"" noise and she said the most terrifying thing was when that noise stopped: Because when it stopped it meant it was dropping its payload. And you just prayed for it to carry on over your head and go and drop the payload on someone else. You didn't really care who the other person was, you just didn't want it to drop on your head.

I don't know what I think ... the technology is one thing, the use and how we use the technology, and where we use the technology is a very different thing.

On a more recent experience with a drone

HM: I was at a wedding recently and they had a drone up, taking photos ... hovering, making this horrible noise. ... And all of the people in the wedding hated this drone even though it was there for a super benign reason; we all loathed the drone. ... And then the drone accidentally crashed and fell and everybody at the wedding put up a huge cheer. Everyone was so thrilled that the drone was out of the sky.

Can you imagine living in a world where that drone is there on a daily basis and it's not benign and it doesn't belong to you? ... I can't imagine living in that world, it must be so disturbing.

On sacrificing one life for the good of many

HM: The appalling moral issue that we've been struggling with as human beings for millions of years is: Do you sacrifice one for the greater good ... one life for 20 lives, for 200 lives, for 500 lives? We know about the little girl [near the suicide bomber] in this movie ... we're not personally involved with the children that might die in the shopping mall on that same day [if the suicide bomber isn't taken out by the drone]. And maybe if we're following one of their stories our whole attitude would change ... and that's sort of the wonder of being a human being and the awfulness of being a human being  we're only really involved in what we're aware of.

On the response to the film

GH: We had a woman stand up in a Q&A Helen and I were at yesterday who said this is the best anti-war film she has ever seen. ...

So if we want to become better at what we do as a society  be more just  people who operate in different areas of expertise have to talk to each other as opposed to pushing out propagandist information that the other side simply ignores.

On saying goodbye to costar Alan Rickman

HM: The reason I think Alan would love this film  and the reason I love to see Alan in this film  is because it's Alan up there. His elegance, his articulation, his fierce intelligence, and his humanity. And it's absolutely Alan that I recognize up on that screen.

i toggle caption Ken Orvidas for NPR Ken Orvidas for NPR

Adults in Ohio are divided when it comes to whether they believe the Affordable Care Act has been good or bad for them.

And while most rate their own health care positively, far more Ohioans rate the state's overall health care system as fair or poor than rate it as excellent. Those are some of the findings in a series of recent polls by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Lilo Whittaker, who responded to the poll, lives on a wooded one-acre lot in rural Ohio. The setting is idyllic on a cold winter morning. Chickadees chirp outside and a pot of coffee brews in the kitchen.

toggle caption Sarah Jane Tribble/WCPN

But at nearly 60 years old, Whittaker says the picture isn't perfect. When Whittaker first heard about the federal health overhaul several years ago, she expected it would help.

""I thought, this is great,"" Whittaker says. ""People will be able to afford their health insurance, get decent coverage and begin to take care of their medical issues.""

But, in the past two years, Whittaker says, her husband's Parkinson's medications went from just over $150 a month to more than $400. The couple's health insurance coverage has also become less affordable.

""A lot of people like me will forgo going to a doctor even if they have a problem because you can't even afford your deductible or your copay,"" she says. ""And I don't think your health insurance issues here are addressed properly.""

Whittaker is among the 27 percent in Ohio who say Obamacare has directly hurt them. On the other hand, 21 percent of Ohioans say it has directly helped them.

At the Free Medical Clinic of Greater Cleveland, there is a steady stream of patients on a recent weekday afternoon.

Over the past two years, the clinic has seen a shift in the people it cares for. More of them have coverage, like 29-year-old Whitnie Momah.

toggle caption Sarah Jane Tribble/WCPN

She smiles when asked about her health care insurance. ""I hear a lot of people say that for them it's gotten worse, but for me, it's gotten better,"" Momah says. ""Before I made too much money to qualify for, like, any type of government assistance but not enough money to where I could afford my health insurance.""

Momah is a nursing student. She says she would be uninsured if she hadn't called for help with HealthCare.gov, the federal insurance exchange. They walked her through the site, and she's now enrolled in a low-cost health insurance plan called Buckeye.

""It really helped me out, it really did,"" she says. ""It was a huge blessing for me.""

Momah's experience, as well as Whittaker's, are two different but very real pictures of Ohio, says Robert Blendon, a professor at the Harvard Chan School.

The polarization there is even more extreme than the nation.

""In Ohio, there are shares of people who really feel that they've been helped by the law and changes in recent years,"" Blendon says. ""There are shares of people who actually don't feel they have been helped and actually hurt. And it's not a unified view of what is going on in Ohio. The divisions are really quite large.""

Nearly 900,000 people have gained health care coverage in the past two years in Ohio  about 240,000 with federal marketplace plans and another 650,000 through Ohio's expansion of Medicaid  something Republican Gov. John Kasich did despite his party's opposition.

You can find the detailed results of the national poll here. Results for Ohio are here.

At the same time, people enrolled in employer-sponsored health insurance have seen a steady climb in the amount they pay out of pocket. One analysis shows that by 2014, Ohio was third in the nation for the most people enrolled in high-deductible health plans.

Reem Aly, a researcher with the nonpartisan Health Policy Institute of Ohio, says people tend to blame the Affordable Care Act for the trend toward high-deductible plans.

""It can be a very polarizing issue,"" Aly says. ""Every person has different circumstances and health care can be very personal.""

For Lilo Whittaker, the ACA is a promise left unfulfilled. She questions why some benefit so much and others, like her, don't. It's not fair, she says.

""We just go without. We don't do anything,"" Whittaker says. ""Christmas was kind of depressing for the grandkids because I told them, I couldn't afford to do what I used to be able to do,"" Whittaker says she has always paid her bills. But now, to afford her husband's medication, she doesn't pay them as well as she used to.",[]

Mikhail Lesin, the former Russian press minister and aide to President Vladimir Putin who was found dead in a Washington, D.C., hotel last November, died from blunt force injuries, according to a new report from the chief medical examiner's office.

It's the first time an official cause of death has been announced in the case. When Lesin died four months ago, Russian media outlets reported that the cause was a heart attack, citing family members.

The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Washington says that blunt force injuries to his head killed Lesin, with other contributing causes listed as blunt force injuries to his ""neck, torso, upper extremeties and lower extremeties.""

Under the entry for manner of death, the medical examiner wrote, ""Undetermined.""

In response to the medical examiner's statement, Russian officials said that they have repeatedly sought information about the investigation into Lesin's death at a hotel in Washington's Dupont Circle neighborhood on Nov. 5.

""But the US side has not provided us with any substantive information,"" Russia's Foreign Ministry official spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. ""We are waiting for clarification from Washington and the relevant official details on the progress of the investigation.""



Police in Washington say they have an active investigation into the death of Lesin, an influential media executive who until early 2015 ran Russia's largest media holding, Gazprom-Media. He worked under Putin for roughly 10 years from 1999 to 2009, first as a press minister and then as an adviser.

Russia Today, the English-language TV and online media outlet, has repeatedly cited Lesin as the man who came up with the idea of establishing the state-run network.

Lesin's death also brought out memories of his long career in Russia, with Sputnik News highlighting his allegiance to former President Boris Yeltsin  and his rumored role in creating a secret video recording that created a storm of scandal around a prosecutor who was investigating Yeltsin's family over allegations of corruption.

When Yeltsin left office, Lesin stayed; he is seen as the man responsible for placing several large TV and other media outlets, such as NTV, under Putin's central control in 2000.

The death of Lesin prompted many conspiracy theories, which variously implicate Putin, the CIA, and, in some corners, Mossad. Early efforts in Russia to describe the cause of death as a heart attack added to the suspicions  and so did reports that Lesin might somehow have been compromised by money-laundering allegations raised by a U.S. senator who claimed Lesin had ""bought homes worth a total of $28 [million] in Los Angeles and moved his immediate family there,"" as The Financial Times reported.

Immediately after Lesin died, the authorities released only the most basic information. From The Washington Post's initial report on his death:",[]

I also discovered, after selecting Gaelynn Lea, that she'd become friends with Alan Sparhawk of the band Low. Sparhawk first heard her perform at a farmers market in Duluth, Minn., where they both live.

Should you pull the trigger? Even if you think you should pull the trigger are there broader political implications and so on that might make you pause?

My parents lived in the war during the blitz and they experienced the German bombers coming overhead and dropping bombs on London. ... . You just prayed for it to carry on over your head and go and drop the payload on someone else.

On personal feelings about drones

Helen Mirren: My parents lived in the war during the blitz and they experienced the German bombers coming overhead and dropping bombs on London. My mother said by far the worst was what was known as the Doodlebug  which were unmanned drones, if you like, early, early drones. ... You heard it coming and it made this ""wuuuuuuuuuuuu"" noise and she said the most terrifying thing was when that noise stopped: Because when it stopped it meant it was dropping its payload. And you just prayed for it to carry on over your head and go and drop the payload on someone else. You didn't really care who the other person was, you just didn't want it to drop on your head.

I don't know what I think ... the technology is one thing, the use and how we use the technology, and where we use the technology is a very different thing.

On a more recent experience with a drone

HM: I was at a wedding recently and they had a drone up, taking photos ... hovering, making this horrible noise. ... And all of the people in the wedding hated this drone even though it was there for a super benign reason; we all loathed the drone. ... And then the drone accidentally crashed and fell and everybody at the wedding put up a huge cheer. Everyone was so thrilled that the drone was out of the sky.

Can you imagine living in a world where that drone is there on a daily basis and it's not benign and it doesn't belong to you? ... I can't imagine living in that world, it must be so disturbing.

On sacrificing one life for the good of many

HM: The appalling moral issue that we've been struggling with as human beings for millions of years is: Do you sacrifice one for the greater good ... one life for 20 lives, for 200 lives, for 500 lives? We know about the little girl [near the suicide bomber] in this movie ... we're not personally involved with the children that might die in the shopping mall on that same day [if the suicide bomber isn't taken out by the drone]. And maybe if we're following one of their stories our whole attitude would change ... and that's sort of the wonder of being a human being and the awfulness of being a human being  we're only really involved in what we're aware of.

On the response to the film

GH: We had a woman stand up in a Q&A Helen and I were at yesterday who said this is the best anti-war film she has ever seen. ... I had a general the other day saying this film should be shown at every single military college for discussion. So if we want to become better at what we do as a society  be more just  people who operate in different areas of expertise have to talk to each other as opposed to pushing out propagandist information that the other side simply ignores.

On saying goodbye to costar Alan Rickman

HM: The reason I think Alan would love this film  and the reason I love to see Alan in this film  is because it's Alan up there. His elegance, his articulation, his fierce intelligence, and his humanity. And it's absolutely Alan that I recognize up on that screen. So I think it's really a great way for us to say goodbye to him.",[]

Adults in Ohio are divided when it comes to whether they believe the Affordable Care Act has been good or bad for them.

And while most rate their own health care positively, far more Ohioans rate the state's overall health care system as fair or poor than rate it as excellent. Those are some of the findings in a series of recent polls by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

Lilo Whittaker, who responded to the poll, lives on a wooded one-acre lot in rural Ohio. The setting is idyllic on a cold winter morning. Chickadees chirp outside and a pot of coffee brews in the kitchen.

But at nearly 60 years old, Whittaker says the picture isn't perfect. When Whittaker first heard about the federal health overhaul several years ago, she expected it would help.

""I thought, this is great,"" Whittaker says. ""People will be able to afford their health insurance, get decent coverage and begin to take care of their medical issues.""

But, in the past two years, Whittaker says, her husband's Parkinson's medications went from just over $150 a month to more than $400. The couple's health insurance coverage has also become less affordable.

""A lot of people like me will forgo going to a doctor even if they have a problem because you can't even afford your deductible or your copay,"" she says. ""And I don't think your health insurance issues here are addressed properly.""

Whittaker is among the 27 percent in Ohio who say Obamacare has directly hurt them. On the other hand, 21 percent of Ohioans say it has directly helped them.

At the Free Medical Clinic of Greater Cleveland, there is a steady stream of patients on a recent weekday afternoon.

Over the past two years, the clinic has seen a shift in the people it cares for. More of them have coverage, like 29-year-old Whitnie Momah.

She smiles when asked about her health care insurance. ""I hear a lot of people say that for them it's gotten worse, but for me, it's gotten better,"" Momah says. ""Before I made too much money to qualify for, like, any type of government assistance but not enough money to where I could afford my health insurance.""

Momah is a nursing student. She says she would be uninsured if she hadn't called for help with HealthCare.gov, the federal insurance exchange. They walked her through the site, and she's now enrolled in a low-cost health insurance plan called Buckeye.

""It really helped me out, it really did,"" she says. ""It was a huge blessing for me.""

Momah's experience, as well as Whittaker's, are two different but very real pictures of Ohio, says Robert Blendon, a professor at the Harvard Chan School.

The polarization there is even more extreme than the nation.

""In Ohio, there are shares of people who really feel that they've been helped by the law and changes in recent years,"" Blendon says. ""There are shares of people who actually don't feel they have been helped and actually hurt. And it's not a unified view of what is going on in Ohio. The divisions are really quite large.""

Nearly 900,000 people have gained health care coverage in the past two years in Ohio  about 240,000 with federal marketplace plans and another 650,000 through Ohio's expansion of Medicaid  something Republican Gov. John Kasich did despite his party's opposition.

You can find the detailed results of the national poll here. Results for Ohio are here.

At the same time, people enrolled in employer-sponsored health insurance have seen a steady climb in the amount they pay out of pocket. One analysis shows that by 2014, Ohio was third in the nation for the most people enrolled in high-deductible health plans.

Reem Aly, a researcher with the nonpartisan Health Policy Institute of Ohio, says people tend to blame the Affordable Care Act for the trend toward high-deductible plans.

""It can be a very polarizing issue,"" Aly says. ""Every person has different circumstances and health care can be very personal.""

For Lilo Whittaker, the ACA is a promise left unfulfilled. She questions why some benefit so much and others, like her, don't. It's not fair, she says.

""We just go without. We don't do anything,"" Whittaker says. ""Christmas was kind of depressing for the grandkids because I told them, I couldn't afford to do what I used to be able to do,"" Whittaker says she has always paid her bills. But now, to afford her husband's medication, she doesn't pay them as well as she used to.",[]

Mischa Berlinski's Haiti is a terrible place. His Haiti is a beautiful place. In his new novel, Peacekeeping, Haiti is either the best or the worst place, all depending on the day, the moment, the observer.

But what Haiti is most of all is compelling. Addicting. For his characters it's the kind of place that inspires an almost mystical obsession. Like the expatriate judge returning to the place of his birth. The journalist. The former Florida cop turned U.N. worker named Terry White who has decided that Haiti, for all its flaws, is the place where he can make his mark. Where he can finally do some good after failing in so many other attempts. Maybe...

""Terry likes to tell himself a lot of stories,"" says Kay, Terry's wife, late in the novel. ""I guess all men do. Women are different  we have to be, we have to live with you people. A man will tell himself he's building a road. Or saving an orphan from a burning building... And if the story is good enough, a man will tell himself it's okay to go to bed at night. But truth is, men don't have a clue. Terry doesn't even know why he gets out of bed in the morning. But I sure know why I do.""

But to begin: Mischa Berlinski (the guy who wrote Fieldwork, which was probably the best missionaries-and-prison-suicide book of 2007) is telling the story of Terry White in Haiti, as seen through the eyes of an unnamed narrator  a journalist-turned-aspiring-novelist who befriends Terry and Kay during a very odd time in Haiti and all of their lives. There's Terry, Kay, who was a real estate agent (and Vicodin addict) crushed by the U.S. financial collapse. There's judge Johel Celestin, an American-educated Haitian who fled the Duvaliers as a boy, then returned, and Johel's wife, Nadia, who is like a phantom  tiny, quiet, beautiful, powerful  and becomes an object of obsession for Terry because Terry is a good man who can't seem to help but do bad.

Honestly, though, that's too simple a description for a Mischa Berlinski character because Berlinski operates in a world where the gray middles of everything (choices, declarations, morality) far outspace the black and white at the margins. Terry is a good man (who, while a Florida deputy sheriff, used to buy Christmas presents for the children of the men he'd locked up), but a terrible husband (who cheats on and half-abandons Kay). He is a man who wants to help the Haitian people (by trying to get Johel Celestin elected as a senator in place of the corrupt incumbent), but is doing it because he has been defeated in his own battles  having lost his career and his home in a vain attempt at playing in the Big Leagues of Florida politics. He is a broken man. Lost, even if he doesn't quite know it, and trying desperately to rediscover himself in Haiti.

And all of this  the politics, the connections, the battle  is really nothing but an attempt to get a road built between the small town of Jeremie (where much of the novel's action takes place) and Port-au-Prince (where the rest of it does). Terry wants the road built. Johel runs for senator on a pledge of getting the road built. The road is important.

""A mango tree is for a small peasant like a little money machine: a mango tree and a road are school fees for your child; a mango tree and a road, and your wife has prenatal care... A mango tree without a road is a pile of fruit...And what happens to the mangoes now? They fall to the ground and rot  the pigs eat the mangoes and the kids go hungry. And why is that? Because there is no road.""

But even that story would, I think, be too simple for Berlinski. The financial crisis, corruption, the downward spiral of morality, a road and mango trees  not enough. Because there's also riots, race, religion, the relationship between Kay and the unnamed writer (who, as in Fieldwork where it was more overt, is a stand-in for Berlinski himself who once followed his own U.N.-employed wife to Haiti), the 2010 earthquake, and the constant juxtaposition of the beauty and ugliness of Haiti, which is hurtling toward disaster despite all the best efforts of those trying to save the country from itself.

Men can content themselves with stories, Kay says, but the women can not. And, ultimately, she is right. It's the earthquake that settles all the action of Peacekeeping  an event beyond the calculations, machinations or good intentions of any man. And in the end?

Well, I won't ruin that for you. But I can say that it all ends with stories  earthquake stories, of course, told by men  and the plans of the women who survived them.

i toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Wilfredo Lee/AP

After one more debate among the Republican contenders for president, the postgame conversation was once again dominated by Donald Trump's behavior.

But for once, it was about his good behavior. He did not shout or fulminate, nor did he pout or belittle his opponents or joust with the moderators.

In fact, after an even dozen of these events, all four remaining candidates kept a remarkably even keel at the University of Miami. Their previous two meetings had been rife with personal attacks that, at times, became almost juvenile, but on this night all four seemed intent on elevating the tone and tending to business.

The themes of the night were almost entirely policy oriented, with a few forays into political process and tiffs over who was doing better or more likely to win in November if nominated.

The two-hour debate was shown on CNN and co-sponsored by the Salem Media Group and The Washington Times. And although there is at least one more debate scheduled in Salt Lake City on March 21, the Miami event had the feeling of a finale.

The moderators began with a long discussion of job creation, which segued into trade, visas for high-tech workers, Social Security, the national debt, Obamacare, education policy, Common Core and, of course, immigration.

Much of the attention was on Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, who have together amassed more than 800 delegates to date. But both Marco Rubio and John Kasich, who face do-or-die primaries in their home states on Tuesday, had ample opportunity to defend their place in the race.

Trump, as has been typical, got most of the air time, with more than 27 minutes. Cruz and Rubio followed with a little under 22 minutes each, Kasich with less than 19.

Rubio and Kasich delivered solid reprises of their strongest debate moments to date, as if to say that if this was going to be their last outing, they would at least be at their best. Rubio, most notably, was once again the smooth and earnest spokesman for a new American dream, sharp on the issue details and long on the idealistic overtures. It was easier to understand why his expectations had been so high than to understand his third- and fourth-place finishes.

""For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation,"" Rubio said. ""And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way. If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived.""

Kasich had this to say near the end of the debate:

""I have run an unwavering, positive campaign for president of the United States. ... Sometimes being positive isn't all that interesting, but it's very interesting to my family, my children and so many supporters that I meet all across the country, and I will continue to run a positive campaign.""

In essence, though, both Rubio and Kasich trail so far behind in the delegate count that they are at this point running for influence at the convention and a prospective vice presidential bid. Either might make a classic running mate with high name recognition and campaign experience.

Florida is the largest swing state in the Electoral College, and no Republican has ever won the White House without winning Ohio.

Cruz, who has been Trump's closest competitor thus far, returned several times to the difference between talking about problems and knowing how to solve them.

""Donald is right,"" Cruz said, gesturing toward Trump. ""For example, he was just talking about international trade. He's right about the problems. But his solutions don't work. So, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods. Now, he backed away from that immediately, and he may come back with a different number tonight.""

At another point, Cruz referred to his rival as ""a candidate who has been funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment,"" adding that ""it's very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington.""

Trump was once again the man in the middle. But he was markedly different in playing the central role. He found a deft way, when discussing education, to mention that former rival candidate Ben Carson would be endorsing him the next day (an important coup given Carson's image, aura and remaining bloc of voters).

As ever, Trump pushed back when others pushed him, but without the ferocity seen in earlier debates. Questioned about how he could get tough on trade and immigration when his businesses brought in foreign workers and made products overseas, Trump responded calmly and firmly:

""Because nobody knows the system better than me. ... I'm a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We're allowed to do it. ... So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws. But I'm the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this stage knows how to change it like I do, believe me.""

Challenged over a protester who was beaten at one of Trump's rallies this week, Trump said he did not condone such behavior. But he also said some of the disturbances at his events were caused by ""bad dudes"" who had been violent and disruptive, and added a salute to the local police, who he said had handled these situations well and deserved more support and respect.

The elevated tone of the Miami debate may have reflected the seriousness of the contest at this juncture. Tuesday brings the second biggest prize of the season: 99 delegates in the winner-take-all state of Florida. It is widely believed that Rubio must win his home state or fold his tent. Also winner-take-all is Ohio, where the same imperative hangs over incumbent Gov. Kasich.

But the other three states voting, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri, rank fifth, 10th and 18th by population and size of convention delegations. Taken together, the five states on March 15 offer nearly as many delegates as were available on Super Tuesday, March 1.

At one point in the debate, the candidates were asked what they would do if none of them had the 1,237 delegates needed for a first ballot nomination.

Trump said he expected to have enough on the first ballot, adding that if he did not he would expect to support whichever candidate had the most. He called on the others to promise as much:",[]

i LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR

We all know that American college education isn't cheap. But it turns out that it's even less cheap if you look at the numbers more closely.

That's what the Wisconsin HOPE Lab did. The lab, part of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, conducted four studies to figure out the true price of college.

To get a sense of student realities, researchers interviewed students on college campuses across the state of Wisconsin. But they also examined 6,604 colleges nationally and compared their costs with regional cost-of-living data from the government.

The researchers found that college life is more expensive than sticker prices might suggest, and that financial aid doesn't help students as effectively as it could, especially after the first year. All these findings are summarized in a report from The Century Foundation.

Colleges want to keep their sticker price low because it helps with rankings and attracts more students, the report says. But students might be less likely to drop out or take time off of college if they could better plan their college finances.

LA Johnson/NPR

Here are some key findings:

College cost-of-living estimates are too low.

Schools can survey students to figure out how much they're spending, and use that as their cost-of-living number.

But the money students report spending might be lower than what they should be spending. The students interviewed were scrimping on basic needs  everything from food to health and dental care.

Students living at home aren't always saving money.

More that 70 percent of stay-at-home students studied were helping their families pay bills. But because those students lived at home, they got less access to aid.

Some majors are more expensive than others.

Students in nursing had to pay for lab work and vaccines. Other majors required expensive study-abroad experience. And some STEM majors found that their textbooks were too expensive and dropped out, or switched majors.

Even students in majors like English faced hidden fees. Some paid hundreds of dollars to take an online course when required classes were overbooked.

Low-income options are often the least cost-effective.

Take meal plans. The plans with the lowest price gave students the least bang for their buck.

If students could afford a laptop, they got free software and other perks. But students who had to rent out laptops were hit with steep fines if they failed to return them in the short borrowing period. If they couldn't afford to live on campus, it was more difficult to return equipment on time.

Financial aid calculators overestimate how much parents can pay.

The calculators don't take into account parents' debt, for example, so they may ask for a larger contribution than the parents can actually afford.

The price that the student pays can increase each academic year.

Forty percent of students studied saw an increase in their share of the bill going into their sophomore year  the median was $1,215. The number jumped again between the second and third year.

Many grants focus on freshman year, and drop off afterward. Students can also lose grants if they don't know that they need to refile for FAFSA, or don't understand that they need to meet academic requirements to keep their grant.",[]

Some doctors and a key group of preventive care experts aren't seeing eye to eye on seniors' need for vision screening during primary care visits.

There's not enough evidence to know whether giving seniors a vision test when they visit their primary care doctor will lead to earlier detection and treatment of cataracts, age-related macular degeneration or refractive problems that could require corrective glasses or contacts, according to guidelines published March 1 by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association.

The task force, an independent group of medical experts, evaluates the scientific evidence related to preventive services for patients that don't have symptoms or signs of medical problems. Under the health law, services that the task force assigns a grade of A or B based on the strength of the evidence must generally be covered by health plans, including Medicare, without charging consumers anything out of pocket.

In this instance  screening for impaired visual acuity in people age 65 and older  the task force assigned an I grade, saying the evidence was insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening, the same grade it assigned screening in 2009 when it last reviewed the evidence.

An organization of eye doctors and surgeons criticized the task force recommendation. In an editorial published in JAMA Ophthalmology, Dr. David Parke II, chief executive officer of the American Academy of Ophthalmology, argued that the task force didn't give enough weight to supporting evidence about the health and quality of life benefits of identifying and addressing visual problems early.

There's a misperception that seniors get an eye exam every year, Parke said in an interview, but many don't. ""This is simply an issue of whether it makes sense, when a senior is in a primary care situation, to look at an eye chart and see if they can see well,"" said Parke. ""For a substantial percentage of seniors it may uncover a treatable disease.""

The task force report said that up to 15 percent of people age 65 and older reported having problems seeing, even with corrective lenses. Many visual problems increase with age, including cataracts, which are a clouding of the lens of the eye, and age-related macular degeneration, in which part of the retina deteriorates.

While agreeing that early detection is generally important, Dr. Alfred Sommer said it is unlikely that having seniors read an eye chart at their primary care physician's office would identify many serious eye problems. Sommer, an ophthalmologist and professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who also wrote an editorial in JAMA Internal Medicine about the vision guidelines. It said that an eye test can identify refractive problems, but that it isn't likely necessary. ""Most people get glasses when they feel they need them,"" he said.

For other eye conditions, such as macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, it's unclear that screening asymptomatic seniors in a primary care screening will be beneficial, Sommer said. That's because ""none of those conditions necessarily reduce your vision until they're bad,"" and probably wouldn't be picked up with a simple vision test, he said.

Cataracts, meanwhile, can reduce vision early but aren't more difficult to treat at a later stage, Sommer said.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology's own recommendations call for people age 65 and older to have a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist every year or two. For seniors who are concerned about eye health, that's good advice, Sommer said.

Many visual problems increase with age, including cataracts, which are a clouding of the lens of the eye, and age-related macular degeneration, in which part of the retina deteriorates.

While agreeing that early detection is generally important, Dr. Alfred Sommer said it is unlikely that having seniors read an eye chart at their primary care physician's office would identify many serious eye problems. Sommer, an ophthalmologist and professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who also wrote an editorial in JAMA Internal Medicine about the vision guidelines. It said that an eye test can identify refractive problems, but that it isn't likely necessary. ""Most people get glasses when they feel they need them,"" he said.

For other eye conditions, such as macular degeneration, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, it's unclear that screening asymptomatic seniors in a primary care screening will be beneficial, Sommer said. That's because ""none of those conditions necessarily reduce your vision until they're bad,"" and probably wouldn't be picked up with a simple vision test, he said.

Cataracts, meanwhile, can reduce vision early but aren't more difficult to treat at a later stage, Sommer said.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology's own recommendations call for people age 65 and older to have a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist every year or two. For seniors who are concerned about eye health, that's good advice, Sommer said.

There's new music from Iggy Pop and it's pretty great.

toggle caption Courtesy of the aritst

The album, Post Pop Depression, is a collaboration with Josh Homme from Queens of the Stone Age. What you hear on this album is a more crooning and thoughtful Iggy then the image you may have in your minds eye of a stage-diving, unpredictable punk. To find out how this all came to pass, we invited them both to sit and talk. They were at NPR West in Culver City, Calif. and I was in Washington, D.C.

The entire interview is lively, funny and thoughtful and you can listen to it along with some music from the album here. Below are a few highlights from the conversation. And this week as part of our First Listen series you can hear all of Post Pop Depression. So dig in and enjoy and keep an eye out for their tour, starting this month.

Josh Homme on his formative experiences with Iggy Pop's music:

When I was 10 years old my father took me to the Tower Records in San Diego, by the sports arena. And I bought albums based on covers from my allowance. It was Off The Bone by the Cramps, and it was a 3D cover. It was the Misfits' Legacy Of Brutality because there was a sort of Elvis looking figure that was a skeleton. And it was Raw Power. I was 10 and Raw Power was so just exactly that: It sounded like someone ripped a cable from the wall and shocked you in the sternum with it. But I didn't actually understand it at 10, I wasn't ready for that. So I think I got through half a song. Then, a couple years later when I was 13, I saw the movie Repo Man. And that song, ""Repo Man,"" I bought that album, and I listened to that thing like it was nobody's business. There was a line in there, I'm just gonna say it, ""I didn't get f***** and I didn't get kissed, I got so f****** pissed,"" and I thought, ""Wow, that's amazing!"" Because I was just in the throws  I had just lost my virginity, so there's a very important moment there. So those are my first impactful Iggy experiences.

Iggy Pop on why he wanted to work with Josh Homme:



There was a unique set of skills that I heard in his stuff. He can compose, which is different than songwriting, but he can also write a song. He knows his way around a memorable lyric and then there was some ""emotive music,"" I would call it, on the last Queens album ... and that's what I wanted to do. And it was done in a style that allowed him to do the vocals, in fact that whole record [where] he ain't shoutin', on any of the record, even on stuff like ""My God Is The Sun"" or ""I Sat By The Ocean."" And I wanted to make a record where I did something other than shout. So I thought the style really lent itself. And then I poked around his other stuff, and, you know, I heard some song he did with PJ Harvey. And I ran into those guys playing a live gig on the road, and it was a little too good, cause I had to follow them [on stage], you know? But as he pointed out to me, the other day, it was in a part of Italy where everyone has a little earring and a motorbike and a buzzcut, and nobody liked either of us.

On how they approached the sound of Post Pop Depression:

Homme: Iggy's in The Stooges, which is, in my opinion, the greatest rock band of all time, and I'm in Queens, so there's no reason to try and out-heavy the memory of these bands. It's silly. And, in fact, what Iggy's been doing in the last number of years in these French albums is emphasizing what I always that was wonderful about his voice and his way, was this crooning aspect. And that really, the most important thing to do would be able to put the proper frame around the artwork; around the piece of art that is Iggy. I keep going back to the Van Eyck brothers, [the] Flemish painter and frame builder duo.

Iggy Pop: I think really it's a little more than a frame going on. Josh starts from the frame and then he starts to move in: ""Could I just, you know, paint a couple of things?""

Homme: I'll do the background for you!

Iggy Pop: ""Oh there's a little tree over here. Can we put a bodega in front of your chest? I think, with a little help, your nose could look better."" We trade off a lot, you know.

On how they made ""American Valhalla"":

Homme: I sent him a demo that was called ""Romans,"" at the time, just as a quick title, because it had kind of this Roman-esque chorus. And so he had, unbeknownst to me, kind of constructed these lyrics around this thing.

Iggy Pop: I'm a Roman history buff and they were a martial society so there was some of that flavor going on. ... Before that we had had an exchange on the subject of the Valhalla, the idea the Norse Paradise to which you gain entry through acts of courage and bravery, and especially if you're killed in battle. He was comparing it favorably against some of the other paradises that you hear about a lot lately. So I wrote him back: ""Well that raises a question to me. Is there an American Valhalla?"" And what I didn't say was obviously because for two reasons; One, in American life we're all encouraged to be heroic from an early age, that's only in America. All other kids are taught to defend themselves from society, you know, ""Watch out! Don't let the government,"" [Pauses.] But in America, ""Be a great person! Be Superman! Help the little, old lady! Be Jimmy Stewart in Mister Smith Goes To Washington! Clean up the corruption! Be wonderful!"" And then, I also said, ""If there is one, where is it? What is it? And if there isn't one, then what does that mean?"" So that really interested me and we texted a little about that and then I thought ... [Pauses.] I got the piece of music, I thought it fit the music. ... I sat in my Rolls ... Yeah, that's right! It's used, it's an old Rolls. I sat in my quaint, old car and just started writing to the thing.

Homme: We agreed to not put anything together until we were together and so it allowed each of us to kind of ruminate alone and spin these webs a little, alone, but with enough room for the other to gain entrance into the idea. And so when we were sitting together I started to say, ""Potentially here's this arrangement."" Each time I had a part, he had this wonderful lyric that you hear; it's exactly the lyric you hear. And it all dove-tailed so uniquely and sort of  I don't want to say sweetly  into the next part because the questions of, not just is there an ""American Valhalla"" but what do you have to do to get in it, and would it be OK if I brought along someone I cared about, you know? Which I thought was ... Iggy is 68 and that 68-year-old perspective in rock and roll is not represented and certainly it isn't represented in a way that is accessible to someone 18, 28, 38, 48, you know. So there's just this unique perspective and I think this song embodies that perspective, in particular at the end when it strips itself bare and says, ""I have nothing but my name,"" and it's a real moment.

On a theory of songwriting:

Iggy Pop: I try to mix three things. I mix something that comes from within me, and it can also include a particular experience, a particular detail that really happened. And then I try to see if that matches up with something I think might have happened to some other people who interest me. And then ... I try to include something that just an everyday person could relate to. I think the first song I ever finished, that I was able to get out on a national basis, was ""1969."" Everybody knew what that was: It was the year but it was also  I figured, correctly  something about that number, that that year was going to be around for a long time. I mean you don't hear a lot about like 1971, but you still hear 1969. That's a powerful number. ... The key is, ""Another year with nothing to do, Boo-Hoo!"" And, for me, that was true because of frustration; Because ... I hadn't gotten my hands on the levers of power, the means of production, that would allow me to express myself. And also I hadn't learned an F-chord yet. But, on the other hand, I was singing for the delinquent group I belonged to, because the other guys in the group would never even think about that. They'd just go, ""Awwww, there's nothing to do.""

Homme: They never knew it that that united them with a bunch of other people.",[]

His is not just a gentle voice; for many people, it's a very familiar one, too. For 25 years, Francois Clemmons played a role on the beloved children's program Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. Clemmons joined the cast of the show in 1968, becoming the first African-American to have a recurring on a kids' TV series.

And, as it happens, it was Clemmons' voice that Fred Rogers noticed, too, when he heard Clemmons singing in church.

""Fred came to me and said, 'I have this idea: You could be a police officer,' "" recalls Clemmons, speaking with his friend Karl Lindholm during a visit with StoryCorps.

Clemmons says he didn't like the idea much at first.

""I grew up in the ghetto. I did not have a positive opinion of police officers. Policeman were siccing police dogs and water hoses on people,"" he says. ""And I really had a hard time putting myself in that role. So I was not excited about being Officer Clemmons at all.""

Still, Clemmons came around to it eventually and agreed to take on the role.

And, in the decades he spent as part of the show, there's one scene in particular that Clemmons remembers with great emotion. It was from an episode that aired in 1969, in which Rogers had been resting his feet in a plastic pool on a hot day.

""He invited me to come over and to rest my feet in the water with him,"" Clemmons recalls. ""The icon Fred Rogers not only was showing my brown skin in the tub with his white skin as two friends, but as I was getting out of that tub, he was helping me dry my feet.""

Clemmons says the scene  which the two also revisited in their last episode together, in 1993  touched him in a way he hadn't expected.

""I think he was making a very strong statement. That was his way. I still was not convinced that Officer Clemmons could have a positive influence in the neighborhood and in the real-world neighborhood, but I think I was proven wrong,"" he says.

During Clemmons' time on the show, he wasn't simply the friendly neighborhood police officer. Off the set, he was also a Grammy-winning singer, who performed in over 70 musical and opera roles and founded the Harlem Spiritual Ensemble.

Rogers, for his part, wasn't simply Clemmons' iconic costar. He was also Clemmons' ""friend for life.""

He says he'll never forget the day Rogers wrapped up the program, as he always did, by taking by hanging up his sweater and saying, ""You make every day a special day just by being you, and I like you just the way you are."" This time in particular, Rogers had been looking right at Clemmons, and after they wrapped he walked over.

Clemmons asked him, ""Fred, were you talking to me?""

""Yes, I have been talking to you for years,"" Rogers said, as Clemmons recalls. ""But you heard me today.""

""It was like telling me I'm OK as a human being,"" Clemmons says. ""That was one of the most meaningful experiences I'd ever had.""

If you follow Team PCHH on Twitter, you know that a week ago, we all trekked up to Manhattan and saw Hamilton, which we intended to talk about on this week's show. Unfortunately, I was struck down by the weirdest and most potent bout of laryngitis of my lifetime, and we had to postpone that show, which you'll get next week. In the meantime, fortunately, we have three conversations featuring awesome people who have never been on PCHH before. Fresh faces!

First, we're bringing you a conversation that NPR Music's Daoud Tyler-Ameen had with Leslie Odom, Jr. late last year. Odom plays Aaron Burr in Hamilton, and they get deeply into issues of performance and risk and interpreting a living writer's material. We just love this chat and we're crazy about Daoud (and Leslie Odom, Jr., obviously), and it's almost worth being sick all week to bring these two guys to you.

The other two chats are from the same New York field trip where we saw Hamilton, when I dropped into the NPR bureau up there and brought in a bunch of really smart people to talk about the things that are on their minds, pop-culturally speaking. (You'll hear that I was already losing my voice and it sounds a little scratchy  sorry!) Earlier this week, we released a conversation I had about American Crime with culture writer Danielle Henderson, and if you missed it, here it is.

In this episode, you'll first hear Sean Rameswaram, a host at WNYC who did the great great (and now concluded) podcast Sideshow. Sean wanted to talk about Kanye West and The Life Of Pablo, so we did. He's got thoughts on what it's like to be a Kanye fan, how the unconventional album release plays into remix culture, and lots more.

Finally, I sat down with Daisy Rosario, of Latino USA, to talk about the upcoming Netflix reboot of Gilmore Girls. Daisy wasn't a fan when the show was first running, but she formed one of those molecular-level bonds with it, particularly after realizing how much she had in common with Rory Gilmore. I reference, by the way, an episode of Latino USA that I highly recommend, and you can find it in their archive.

We've got more to come from the field trip, so stay tuned in the coming weeks, and next week, we really will talk about Hamilton.",[]

The fifth year of the Syrian conflict was the worst yet for civilians  and Russia, the U.S., France and Britain are partly to blame. That's according to a new report from 30 aid and human rights groups, including Oxfam and Care International.

Titled ""Fuelling the Fire,"" the report says some 50,000 people have been killed since April 2014 and that nearly a million more have been forced to flee their homes. It also says that as permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, the U.S., Britain, France and Russia could be doing much more to end the bloodshed.

While fixing most of the blame on the Syrian regime and armed opposition groups, as well as violent extremists such as the Islamic State, the report says major world powers are undermining their own calls for peace through the weapons they provide to combatants, their own military strikes and what the report calls inadequate pressure on their allies to stop the killing.

Russia comes in for blame for its deadly air campaign, and for failing to stop its Syrian ally from using sieges and starvation as weapons of war.

Jan Egeland with the Norwegian Refugee Council, one of the groups behind the report, said this week in Geneva that despite recent progress in aiding besieged areas, there are still seven places where they can't get aid to trapped people.

""It's very clear that the seven areas where we have not reached, are [controlled]  six by the government, one by Islamic State,"" he said. ""The two areas [controlled] by armed opposition groups in the north and Idlib, we have been able to service those.""

Reason for hope did appear on the horizon just as this report was being finalized. A fragile cease-fire has allowed aid to reach some besieged areas in Syria, and problematic peace talks could resume in Geneva as early as Monday.

The authors of the report acknowledge that Russia and the U.S. in particular deserve credit for this progress, but they add that the ""tremendous test"" now facing them is to get their allies to keep their guns quiet while diplomats strive for a more enduring cessation of hostilities.",[]

Josh Homme on his formative experiences with Iggy Pop's music:

When I was 10 years old my father took me to the Tower Records in San Diego, by the sports arena. And I bought albums based on covers from my allowance. It was Off The Bone by the Cramps, and it was a 3D cover. It was the Misfits' Legacy Of Brutality because there was a sort of Elvis looking figure that was a skeleton. And it was Raw Power. I was 10 and Raw Power was so just exactly that: It sounded like someone ripped a cable from the wall and shocked you in the sternum with it. But I didn't actually understand it at 10, I wasn't ready for that. So I think I got through half a song. Then, a couple years later when I was 13, I saw the movie Repo Man.

It's the off-season in the resort town of Harbert, Mich., yet every table at Cafe Gulistan is full. Most guests have braved the chilly night to support an old friend, the cafe owner, Ibrahim Parlak.

Parlak, 53, focuses on the cooking. His friends focus on Parlak's possible deportation to his native Turkey.

In 1991, Parlak, an ethnic Kurd, arrived from Turkey, saying he had been imprisoned and tortured in his homeland. He was granted political asylum in the U.S. the following year.

But for more than 10 years, U.S. immigration authorities have been trying to reverse that decision and deport him. Turkey wants him back, saying Parlak led a ""terror unit"" and is linked to the killing of two Turkish soldiers in 1988.

Parlak has remained in the U.S. thanks to private legislation in Congress that a Republican House member and a Democratic senator have introduced every two years since 2005. Emails released from Hillary Clinton's days as the secretary of state show she inquired about Parlak's case, asking ""What can we do?""

Parlak's latest deportation deferral is about to expire and he could be deported as soon as this month.

At the cafe, he has many defenders.

""It's just wrong,"" says Angela Reichert over her appetizer. ""You just walk around with a lump in your throat, just wondering what's going to happen.""

Reichert sits by the window with her husband, Rick Ott. They've been raising money for lawyers and distributing petitions to help Parlak.

One table over, Marty Goldrick agrees: ""We're still just hoping and praying that we can keep him here.""

Goldrick is a Vietnam veteran and started playing tennis with Parlak more than 20 years ago.

From A Troubled Part Of Turkey

Parlak grew up in a small town in southeast Turkey. He says he misses it, but growing up there wasn't easy.

The Kurdish minority is concentrated in southeast Turkey and in neighboring countries including Iran, Iraq and Syria. Kurdish militants in Turkey have battled the Turkish government for years, and fighting has picked up again after a peace effort collapsed recently.

During high school, Parlak became a Kurdish activist. That's when he was jailed by the Turkish government and, he says, tortured.

""No food, holding [me] in a small box, spraying [me] with cold water,"" Parlak says. ""I mean, anything you can imagine.""

After Parlak was released, he continued his activism and spent a second stint in prison. Eventually, Parlak fled to the U.S. with a fake passport and a suitcase packed with documents showing he had been tortured.

He says he still remembers the woman at airport immigration who let him into New York.

""If I could see her, I just going to give her a big hug,"" he says.

He then set out to build a new life. He learned English, fell in love, opened his cafe and had a daughter  though he never married.

'One Stupid Box'

Everything began unraveling when Parlak applied for U.S. citizenship in 1998.

When authorities reviewed Parlak's file, they found that years earlier, he'd checked a box on his Green Card application indicating he'd never been arrested. He did the same on his citizenship application. (Parlak received his Green Card in 1994, but his citizenship application was formally denied in 2001).

Parlak says this was a small mistake and not intended to mislead authorities. He points out that he'd submitted proof of his imprisonment when he applied for political asylum.

""I give it to them. My jail ID card,"" he says.

Still, Parlak was in a bind. Turkey considers the Kurdistan Workers Party, also known as the PKK, to be a terrorist group. In 1997, the U.S. also declared the PKK a terrorist organization. And U.S. immigration authorities say Parlak was involved with the PKK.

Parlak disagrees and claims he was not part of the PKK. ""I never harmed anybody, never hurt anybody,"" he says.

Instead, he says, he was a nonviolent activist who sought to improve Kurdish human rights and preserve Kurdish culture.

""I did organize a hunger strikes,"" says Parlak. ""I organized, you know, workers for better conditions.""

The Turkish Version

The Turkish Embassy in Washington offers a very different version of events.

""After meeting with the chief of the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan, Ibrahim Parlak obtained training in PKK camps,"" reads a strongly worded statement from the Turkish embassy spokesman, Fitah Oke. ""On May 21 1988, his heavily armed unit illegally crossed over to Turkey from Syria.""

The Turkish Embassy says Parlak was involved in an attack that left two Turkish soldiers dead and they've asked for Parlak to be sent back to Turkey.

Parlak says he was crossing the border at the time, but was not part of the fighting that broke out. ""We went over a hill and then the fighting started behind us,"" Parlak says.

In Parlak's Michigan community, his supporters say what counts is the life he's lived here for the past quarter-century.

""He's led an exemplary life,"" says U.S. Rep. Fred Upton, a Republican who represents the district where Parlak lives.

Upton and former Michigan Sen. Carl Levin, a Democrat, have played a crucial role in helping Parlak, introducing private legislation on his behalf every two years since 2005. This has allowed Parlak to stay without fear of deportation. While Congress has never voted on the measure, this pending legislation has delayed Parlak's deportation.

But last year, Levin retired and no other senator has stepped forward to introduce similar legislation.

Parlak's latest deferral expires on March 22, at which point he could be deported. Now, Parlak is hoping the Board of Immigration Appeals will help him.

However, U.S. courts have repeatedly ruled against Parlak. They found that he willfully misrepresented information, raised money that went to the PKK and transported their weapons.

Parlak, as well as a dissenting judge, have argued these rulings are unfair. They say the U.S. courts relied on evidence obtained via torture in Turkey and used documents from Turkey's State Security Courts, special courts that heard offenses considered a threat to the state. The judicial standards of these courts were questioned and they've since been disbanded as part of a reform effort.

Parlak's lawyers are hoping the Board of Immigration Appeals will reopen Parlak's case, citing the international Convention Against Torture. They argue the U.S. cannot send Parlak to Turkey because he'll likely be tortured.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement disagree and they've filed a brief arguing the case should not be reopened.

In the meantime, Parlak's possible return is making headlines in Turkey and, Rep. Upton says, it's also mobilizing his district in Michigan.

""I've heard from hundreds of constituents in support of him,"" Upton says. ""It's mind-boggling.""",[]

i LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR

We all know that American college education isn't cheap. But it turns out that it's even less cheap if you look at the numbers more closely.

That's what the Wisconsin HOPE Lab did. The lab, part of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, conducted four studies to figure out the true price of college.

To get a sense of student realities, researchers interviewed students on college campuses across the state of Wisconsin. But they also examined 6,604 colleges nationally and compared their costs with regional cost-of-living data from the government.

The researchers found that college life is more expensive than sticker prices might suggest, and that financial aid doesn't help students as effectively as it could, especially after the first year. All these findings are summarized in a report from The Century Foundation.

Colleges want to keep their sticker price low because it helps with rankings and attracts more students, the report says. But students might be less likely to drop out or take time off of college if they could better plan their college finances.

LA Johnson/NPR

Here are some key findings:

College cost-of-living estimates are too low.

Schools can survey students to figure out how much they're spending, and use that as their cost-of-living number.

But the money students report spending might be lower than what they should be spending. The students interviewed were scrimping on basic needs  everything from food to health and dental care.

Students living at home aren't always saving money.

More that 70 percent of stay-at-home students studied were helping their families pay bills. But because those students lived at home, they got less access to aid.

Some majors are more expensive than others.

Students in nursing had to pay for lab work and vaccines. Other majors required expensive study-abroad experience. And some STEM majors found that their textbooks were too expensive and dropped out, or switched majors.

Even students in majors like English faced hidden fees. Some paid hundreds of dollars to take an online course when required classes were overbooked.

Low-income options are often the least cost-effective.

Take meal plans. The plans with the lowest price gave students the least bang for their buck.

If students could afford a laptop, they got free software and other perks. But students who had to rent out laptops were hit with steep fines if they failed to return them in the short borrowing period. If they couldn't afford to live on campus, it was more difficult to return equipment on time.

Financial aid calculators overestimate how much parents can pay.

The calculators don't take into account parents' debt, for example, so they may ask for a larger contribution than the parents can actually afford.

The price that the student pays can increase each academic year.

Forty percent of students studied saw an increase in their share of the bill going into their sophomore year  the median was $1,215. The number jumped again between the second and third year.

Many grants focus on freshman year, and drop off afterward. Students can also lose grants if they don't know that they need to refile for FAFSA, or don't understand that they need to meet academic requirements to keep their grant.",[]

It's the off-season in the resort town of Harbert, Mich., yet every table at Cafe Gulistan is full. Most guests have braved the chilly night to support an old friend, the cafe owner, Ibrahim Parlak.

Parlak, 53, focuses on the cooking. His friends focus on Parlak's possible deportation to his native Turkey.

In 1991, Parlak, an ethnic Kurd, arrived from Turkey, saying he had been imprisoned and tortured in his homeland. He was granted political asylum in the U.S. the following year.

But for more than 10 years, U.S. immigration authorities have been trying to reverse that decision and deport him. Turkey wants him back, saying Parlak led a ""terror unit"" and is linked to the killing of two Turkish soldiers in 1988.

Parlak has remained in the U.S. thanks to private legislation in Congress that a Republican House member and a Democratic senator have introduced every two years since 2005. Emails released from Hillary Clinton's days as the secretary of state show she inquired about Parlak's case, asking ""What can we do?""

Parlak's latest deportation deferral is about to expire and he could be deported as soon as this month.

At the cafe, he has many defenders.

""It's just wrong,"" says Angela Reichert over her appetizer. ""You just walk around with a lump in your throat, just wondering what's going to happen.""

Reichert sits by the window with her husband, Rick Ott. They've been raising money for lawyers and distributing petitions to help Parlak.

One table over, Marty Goldrick agrees: ""We're still just hoping and praying that we can keep him here.""

Goldrick is a Vietnam veteran and started playing tennis with Parlak more than 20 years ago.

From A Troubled Part Of Turkey

Parlak grew up in a small town in southeast Turkey. He says he misses it, but growing up there wasn't easy.

The Kurdish minority is concentrated in southeast Turkey and in neighboring countries including Iran, Iraq and Syria. Kurdish militants in Turkey have battled the Turkish government for years, and fighting has picked up again after a peace effort collapsed recently.

During high school, Parlak became a Kurdish activist. That's when he was jailed by the Turkish government and, he says, tortured.

""No food, holding [me] in a small box, spraying [me] with cold water,"" Parlak says. ""I mean, anything you can imagine.""

After Parlak was released, he continued his activism and spent a second stint in prison. Eventually, Parlak fled to the U.S. with a fake passport and a suitcase packed with documents showing he had been tortured.

He says he still remembers the woman at airport immigration who let him into New York.

""If I could see her, I just going to give her a big hug,"" he says.

He then set out to build a new life. He learned English, fell in love, opened his cafe and had a daughter  though he never married.

'One Stupid Box'

Everything began unraveling when Parlak applied for U.S. citizenship in 1998.

When authorities reviewed Parlak's file, they found that years earlier, he'd checked a box on his Green Card application indicating he'd never been arrested. He did the same on his citizenship application. (Parlak received his Green Card in 1994, but his citizenship application was formally denied in 2001).

Parlak says this was a small mistake and not intended to mislead authorities. He points out that he'd submitted proof of his imprisonment when he applied for political asylum.

""I give it to them. My jail ID card,"" he says.

Still, Parlak was in a bind. Turkey considers the Kurdistan Workers Party, also known as the PKK, to be a terrorist group. In 1997, the U.S. also declared the PKK a terrorist organization. And U.S. immigration authorities say Parlak was involved with the PKK.

""I did organize a hunger strikes,"" says Parlak. ""I organized, you know, workers for better conditions.""

i toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images

Even though the thought of Donald Trump at the top of the ticket is making a lot of Republicans in Congress queasy, they're not exactly flocking to the guy in second place to save them  Ted Cruz. Cruz did not have a single endorsement from any of his Senate colleagues, until this week when Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah committed his support. Marco Rubio, on the other hand, has landed 14 Senate endorsements.

That's because the bad blood between Cruz and his colleagues runs so deep.

It's Getting Awkward

Probably the most awkward question you can ask Republican senators these days is why they're still giving Ted Cruz the cold shoulder when it comes to endorsements.

""Well, I think you know the answer to that,"" said Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma.

""I'm going to let you ... speculate about that,"" offered Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.

""I think it's pretty obvious,"" said Dean Heller of Nevada, without elaborating further.

What each of these senators is tiptoeing around is common knowledge in Washington: Ted Cruz is probably the most disliked member of the Senate.

South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, who dropped his own presidential bid, even joked about it at the Washington Press Club dinner last month.

""If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody could convict you,"" Graham said to a ballroom full of reporters.

Cause, Baby, Now We've Got Bad Blood

How did the relationship go so wrong? Well, the romance never took off.

During Cruz's very first year in the Senate, he and a group of House Republicans helped force a 16-day government shutdown. At the time, in 2013, he crowed about it. But his Senate Republican colleagues were fuming. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire said Cruz had led them on with a promise to defund Obamacare.

""You know, we've been asking from the beginning: What's the end game? How does this end? How do you achieve what you're purporting to achieve on defunding Obamacare? And I never got an answer to that,"" Ayotte told reporters when the government was reopening that October.

And then there was the time Cruz flirted with the idea of defunding the president's executive action on immigration. He fumbled a procedural maneuver on the Senate floor, which forced his colleagues to come to work on a Saturday. Not the kind of smooth move that will earn one's way into senators' hearts.

""You should have an end goal in sight if you're going to do these types of things,"" said Utah Republican Orrin Hatch that weekend in December 2014. ""And I don't see any end goal that can be won  other than just irritating a lot of people.""

And then, of course, there was the time Cruz called Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a liar.

""He is willing to say things he knows are false. That has consequences for how this body operates,"" said Cruz during a nearly 20-minute speech on the Senate floor last July. The spat was over renewing the Export-Import Bank.

But this year, Republicans anguishing over the rise of Donald Trump can see that Cruz has pulled way ahead of Marco Rubio, who has the most Senate endorsements. Maybe it's time for the rift between Cruz and his colleagues to heal.

Republican Bill Cassidy of Louisiana compared it to marriage.

""Occasionally my wife has said something to me, or I to her, that we wish we had not said later. At the time, we're thinking, 'Oh, my gosh.' But we've worked through that, and we forget it, and we move on because there's something far more important than an occasional harsh word,"" said Cassidy.

Utah's Lee became the first senator to endorse Cruz, on Thursday. Maybe others will follow. Even the guy who joked about murdering Cruz on the Senate floor is coming around.

""Increasingly more clear to me that Ted Cruz is the most viable alternative to Donald Trump,"" Sen. Graham said this week. ""I think a Trump candidacy would be a disaster for the Republican brand. I think John Kasich and Rubio are more electable than Ted, but Ted's running effectively as an outsider in an outsider year.""

But, of course, no outsider wants too many love notes from Republican senators.",[]

i toggle caption Carlos Osorio/AP Carlos Osorio/AP

If you don't hang out with lawmakers, economists and journalists in Washington, you probably think Democrats and Republicans disagree on economic policy.

They don't.

In Washington, there's actually a broad consensus about economic growth. These ideas have held sway for decades:

Globalization is inevitable

technology boosts productivity

immigration brings in fresh talent

trade deals spur growth

Of course, Democrats and Republicans disagree on the details, but the framework has remained solid regardless of who holds power in the White House or Congress.

That's why President Obama, a Democrat, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, both support the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal. It's why Obama says that ""generations of immigrants have made this country into what it is,"" and Ryan says that ""immigrants contribute to our economy.""

It's why Democrat Nancy Pelosi says that ""it is imperative that America continues to lead the world through innovation,"" and Republican Mitch McConnell says that ""the Internet and the rapid adoption of mobile technology have been great American success stories.""

Now, Washington's cozy cocoon of ideas is getting a violent shaking from Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.

Trump, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, and Sanders who is seeking the Democratic nomination, are very different candidates. One is a billionaire businessman, and the other a democratic socialist.

But each is appealing to voters who believe that Washington's economic framework is rotten. The candidates want to tear it down, and millions of working-class Americans agree.

The people who helped build that framework are taking note.

""While the U.S. economy is performing well, the electorate remains unconvinced, even angry over how the economy has not performed for them, and their anger is stirred by presidential candidates in both parties,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in a written assessment Thursday.

To understand what's been happening this presidential primary season, consider Michigan, where voters turned out in huge numbers for Sanders and Trump. According to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data, the inflation-adjusted annual median household income in Michigan fell by about $14,000 a year  down to about $52,000  from 1999 to 2014.

That same time period played out very differently for corporations. From 1999 to 2014, U.S. annual corporate profits after taxes shot up by about 250 percent, to nearly $1.7 trillion.

So yes, businesses did much better, allowing Washington thought leaders to, in effect, say: ""See, we were right! We promoted the ideas that have kept America's GDP ranked No. 1 in the world, even though China has four times our population.""

But outside of Washington, millions of Americans are not living in a Big Picture or a Framework. They are living in houses that have lost value, in cities where they don't trust the water pipes and where companies can suddenly announce they are moving jobs to other countries.

With their support of Sanders and Trump, those workers have made it clear they want a new paradigm. Trump talks about building a wall to stop immigrants; Sanders talks about breaking up big banks. So their solutions are quite different, but the message is the same: No more business as usual.

Many economists say the alternatives would only be worse. They point to Argentina  it was one of the world's richest nations a century ago. Then it fell behind in technological innovation and education, became politically chaotic and declined dramatically.

The only way to improve the lives of average Americans is to encourage them to fit themselves into a technologically advanced, fast-changing, intensely competitive global economy.

But other economists are saying Washington does need to rethink its assumptions.

Andrew Levin is a Dartmouth economics professor who spent many years in Washington as an economist for the Federal Reserve and for the International Monetary Fund.

He said that for decades, economists have been basing their ideas on formulas that showed the free flows of goods, capital and people would maximize wealth.

But these days, many are ""recognizing that our models are too simple ... life is more complex,"" Levin said.

In other words, economists were right to say more trade could boost wealth, but wrong to assume it would help most workers. As wages have stagnated, ""confidence in the Washington consensus has very much faded over the past 10 years,"" Levin said.

So should the Washington consensus change?

Yes, ""but you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater,"" Levin warned. For example, he said it would be a big mistake to shut off all trade or return to an obsolete gold standard.

Instead, he recommends that economic and policy leaders take smaller steps while re-examining the data. For example, they could decide that ""trade agreements should ensure that the benefits are shared more evenly with American families,"" he said.",[]

i toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images

Chicago is having a bloody year.

Already since January, more than 100 people have been murdered in the city  double the number of homicides in Chicago during the first two months last year. The number of shooting incidents is also up by 120 percent compared to the first nine weeks of 2015.

The spike in violent crime comes at a time when the police in Chicago is under increased scrutiny for misconduct.

It started with the release of a video last fall that showed a white police officer shooting a black teenager 16 times, resulting in a Justice Department civil rights investigation into the Chicago Police Department's patterns and practices. Then there were other incidents of police shootings, brutality and misconduct, followed by allegations of officers covering for one another and higher ups failing to hold officers accountable.

In short, the heat and public scrutiny on Chicago police officers right now is intense.

""Well, morale is poor, to describe it in one word,"" says Dean Angelo Sr., president of Chicago's Fraternal Order of Police. ""It's probably the lowest I've seen in my career.""

There is a feeling among police officers, Angelo says, ""that no one wants to be on that next video.""

The 'Laquan McDonald Effect'

The dash cam video released under court order in November showed Officer Jason Van Dyke firing 16 shots into Laquan McDonald as the 17-year-old was moving away from the police while holding a small knife. The incident continues to hamper Chicago police.

Van Dyke was charged with murder  but only hours before the video went public and more than a year after the shooting took place. The political fallout from the video's release amid daily anti-police protests cost police Supt. Garry McCarthy his job.

Interim police Supt. John Escalante acknowledges there might have been a ""Laquan McDonald effect,"" where police officers are less aggressive and even somewhat passive in pursuing criminals.

""There's a little bit of an effect,"" says Escalante. ""Every officer I think, not just here in Chicago, but every police officer around the country does not want to be that next viral video.""

Police in Chicago made 30 percent fewer arrests in the early part of this year compared to last year. Street stops are down more than 80 percent so far this year.

Escalante was so concerned that he recently recorded a video message sent out to all 12,000 Chicago police officers emphasizing that those doing their jobs properly don't have to worry about being that next viral video. He also clarified how officers can continue to make investigative street stops without violating new state laws and announced a landmark agreement with the ACLU designed to prevent racial profiling. As a result, Escalante says both arrests and street stops are now back on the rise.

But the city's sharp increase in violent crime continues unabated.

""The majority of it is still gang violence,"" Escalante says. ""We're seeing a significant percentage of that gang violence being fueled by social media.""

Escalante says social media taunts are the new gang graffiti and in today's gang culture, there are almost immediate, violent responses to those taunts, which in turn spurs retaliatory shootings.

A very mild winter may also be contributing to Chicago's increase in violence. Warmer weather means more people are out and there is more opportunity for conflicts. When temperatures reached the 70s earlier this week, 21 people were shot and two of them were killed in a 20-hour period.

Angelo rejects the notion that the police are somehow responsible for an increase in violent crime, but he says the police are under pressure.

""You know, they're damned when they put people on the wall and search them ... if they have weapons on them, and now they're being blamed for not putting people on the wall to searching them to see if they have weapons on them,"" he says.

Angelo says police officers now are walking what he calls ""a thin blue line"" between protecting law abiding citizens and getting law breakers off the streets. Some cops on the street agree.

""Yeah, (the) job's real tough,"" says 17-year veteran police officer Ron Rewers. ""You know, you got a lot of eyes on you and a lot of people don't understand the job and they want to jump to conclusions about what we do and what we're supposed to do.""

Improving Relations With Chicago Teens

Rewers is one of several officers from the 12th Chicago police district volunteering on Friday nights to coach a new basketball league for 13- to 15-year-old boys who live in and around the public housing development known as the ABLA homes on the city's west side.

Officer Paris Edwards, another 17-year veteran of the force, came up with the idea for the league as a way to improve relations with teenagers in the neighborhood.

""We've known for quite a while that the relationship between the police and youth has been one that has been strained,"" Edwards says. ""The youth feel like the only time they have interaction with the police is when they're being stopped for questioning or they're being looked at for committing some type of crime.""

Edwards says the goal is to build a little teamwork and trust.

""In basketball, you do have to communicate. Coaches and players have to communicate. If we can get the youth communicating with these officers, then we can develop some type of relationship outside of them being stopped and questioned for some type of crime,"" he says.

Star player Daronte Peterson, 13, says he welcomes the chance to see police officers in a different arena.

""I'm glad they doing this because like, right here where we are at now, it's a very bad neighborhood and I'm glad the police came to do this for us,"" Peterson says.

If the police-led basketball program shows real results in improving relations between beat cops and black teenagers, city officials say it will likely be expanded and replicated across the city.",[]

i toggle caption The Washington Post/The Washington Post/Getty Images The Washington Post/The Washington Post/Getty Images

Donald Trump's campaign has spent an unusual amount of time this week answering questions about violent incidents.

The latest involves an allegation by reporter Michelle Fields of conservative site Breitbart that she was assaulted by someone who was ID'd by another reporter as Trump's campaign manager.

Here's what we know:

What Fields reported



Fields said that someone had ""grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down"" after a press conference Tuesday. Washington Post reporter Ben Terris witnessed what happened and identified the man as Trump manager Corey Lewandowski, reporting that the altercation left Fields with ""finger-shaped bruises"" on her arm. The Daily Beast also reported that ""sources said Lewandowski acknowledged to Breitbart's Washington political editor, Matthew Boyle, that he did manhandle Fields."" And on Thursday, Politico posted the audio of the alleged incident.

Fields also spoke about the incident to ABC News Thursday, saying ""Honestly, it's been really hurtful, because obviously nobody wants to be touched and violated like that."" She was also asked what she would want to tell Trump about the incident and responded, ""I would just ask him to put himself in my shoes and imagine if I was his daughter.""

Trump campaign denies incident

The Trump campaign forcefully denied Fields' story, saying in a statement that ""the accusation, which has only been made in the media and never addressed directly with the campaign, is entirely false. ... In addition to our staff, which had no knowledge of said situation, not a single camera or reporter of more than 100 in attendance captured the alleged incident.""

In the spin room after Thursday night's GOP debate, Trump himself also said, ""they said nothing happened, everybody said nothing happened. Perhaps she made the story up, I think that's what happened.""

The campaign's statement also questioned Fields' credibility: ""We leave to others whether this is part of a larger pattern of exaggerating incidents.""

Lewandowski then called Fields an ""attention seeker"" in a tweet linking to a 2015 article that alleges former Rep. Allen West assaulted Fields.

Breitbart claims mistaken identity

i toggle caption The Washington Post/The Washington Post/Getty Images The Washington Post/The Washington Post/Getty Images

Donald Trump's campaign has spent an unusual amount of time this week answering questions about violent incidents.

The latest involves an allegation by reporter Michelle Fields of conservative site Breitbart that she was assaulted by someone who was ID'd by another reporter as Trump's campaign manager.

Here's what we know:

What Fields reported



Fields said that someone had ""grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down"" after a press conference Tuesday. Washington Post reporter Ben Terris witnessed what happened and identified the man as Trump manager Corey Lewandowski, reporting that the altercation left Fields with ""finger-shaped bruises"" on her arm. The Daily Beast also reported that ""sources said Lewandowski acknowledged to Breitbart's Washington political editor, Matthew Boyle, that he did manhandle Fields."" And on Thursday, Politico posted the audio of the alleged incident.

Fields also spoke about the incident to ABC News Thursday, saying ""Honestly, it's been really hurtful, because obviously nobody wants to be touched and violated like that."" She was also asked what she would want to tell Trump about the incident and responded, ""I would just ask him to put himself in my shoes and imagine if I was his daughter.""

Trump campaign denies incident

The Trump campaign forcefully denied Fields' story, saying in a statement that ""the accusation, which has only been made in the media and never addressed directly with the campaign, is entirely false. ... In addition to our staff, which had no knowledge of said situation, not a single camera or reporter of more than 100 in attendance captured the alleged incident.""

In the spin room after Thursday night's GOP debate, Trump himself also said, ""they said nothing happened, everybody said nothing happened. Perhaps she made the story up, I think that's what happened.""

The campaign's statement also questioned Fields' credibility: ""We leave to others whether this is part of a larger pattern of exaggerating incidents.""

Lewandowski then called Fields an ""attention seeker"" in a tweet linking to a 2015 article that alleges former Rep. Allen West assaulted Fields.

Breitbart claims mistaken identity

Breitbart initially said it ""stands behind Michelle Fields"" and that ""Trump's suggestion that Fields made up the incident Tuesday evening contradicts the evidence, including her own injuries, an account from Washington Post reporter Ben Terris, and audio recorded at the scene.""

But Friday morning the organization said that after reviewing video footage it still believes the incident happened but does not believe Lewandowski was behind it.

i toggle caption Carlos Osorio/AP Carlos Osorio/AP

If you don't hang out with lawmakers, economists and journalists in Washington, you probably think Democrats and Republicans disagree on economic policy.

They don't.

In Washington, there's actually a broad consensus about economic growth. These ideas have held sway for decades:

Globalization is inevitable

Technology boosts productivity

Immigration brings in fresh talent

Trade deals spur growth

Of course, Democrats and Republicans disagree on the details, but the framework has remained solid regardless of who holds power in the White House or Congress.

That's why President Obama, a Democrat, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, both support the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal. It's why Obama says that ""generations of immigrants have made this country into what it is,"" and Ryan says that ""immigrants contribute to our economy.""

It's why Democrat Nancy Pelosi says that ""it is imperative that America continues to lead the world through innovation,"" and Republican Mitch McConnell says that ""the Internet and the rapid adoption of mobile technology have been great American success stories.""

Now, Washington's cozy cocoon of ideas is getting a violent shaking from Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.

Trump, who is running for the Republican presidential nomination, and Sanders who is seeking the Democratic nomination, are very different candidates. One is a billionaire businessman, and the other a democratic socialist.

But each is appealing to voters who believe that Washington's economic framework is rotten. The candidates want to tear it down, and millions of working-class Americans agree.

The people who helped build that framework are taking note.

""While the U.S. economy is performing well, the electorate remains unconvinced, even angry over how the economy has not performed for them, and their anger is stirred by presidential candidates in both parties,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said in a written assessment Thursday.

To understand what's been happening this presidential primary season, consider Michigan, where voters turned out in huge numbers for Sanders and Trump. According to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data, the inflation-adjusted annual median household income in Michigan fell by about $14,000 a year  down to about $52,000  from 1999 to 2014.

That same time period played out very differently for corporations. From 1999 to 2014, U.S. annual corporate profits after taxes shot up by about 250 percent, to nearly $1.7 trillion.

So, yes, businesses did much better, allowing Washington thought-leaders to, in effect, say: ""See, we were right! We promoted the ideas that have kept America's GDP ranked No. 1 in the world, even though China has four times our population.""

But outside of Washington, millions of Americans are not living in a Big Picture or a Framework. They are living in houses that have lost value, in cities where they don't trust the water pipes and where companies can suddenly announce they are moving jobs to other countries.

With their support of Sanders and Trump, those workers have made it clear they want a new paradigm. Trump talks about building a wall to stop immigrants; Sanders talks about breaking up big banks. So their solutions are quite different, but the message is the same: No more business as usual.

Many economists say the alternatives would only be worse. They point to Argentina  it was one of the world's richest nations a century ago. Then it fell behind in technological innovation and education, became politically chaotic and declined dramatically.

The only way to improve the lives of average Americans is to encourage them to fit themselves into a technologically advanced, fast-changing, intensely competitive global economy.

But other economists are saying Washington does need to rethink its assumptions.

Andrew Levin is a Dartmouth economics professor who spent many years in Washington as an economist for the Federal Reserve and for the International Monetary Fund.

He said that for decades, economists have been basing their ideas on formulas that showed the free flows of goods, capital and people would maximize wealth.

But these days, many are ""recognizing that our models are too simple ... life is more complex,"" Levin said.

In other words, economists were right to say more trade could boost wealth, but wrong to assume it would help most workers. As wages have stagnated, ""confidence in the Washington consensus has very much faded over the past 10 years,"" Levin said.

So should the Washington consensus change?

Yes, ""but you don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater,"" Levin warned. For example, he said, it would be a big mistake to shut off all trade or return to an obsolete gold standard.

Instead, he recommends that economic and policy leaders take smaller steps while re-examining the data. For example, they could decide that ""trade agreements should ensure that the benefits are shared more evenly with American families,"" he said.",[]

The charity has received hundreds of millions of dollars in yearly donations. But after media reports charged massive overspending and waste by the Wounded Warrior Project, the organization's board of directors fired its CEO and chief operation officer Thursday.

""CEO Steve Nardizzi and COO Al Giordano are no longer with the organization,"" the charity announced in a news release that also reported the results of an independent review of its finances  a review that was prompted by a series of CBS News reports that said the Wounded Warrior Project uses some 40 percent of its funds on overhead expenses and pays millions of dollars on staff conferences and meetings in luxurious settings.

This week, the group has been using its Facebook page to defend its fundraising costs and to say that it ""has always been an open and transparent organization,"" citing its most recent IRS filing as proof.

That filing, IRS form 990, shows that in the financial year from Oct. 1, 2013, to Sept. 30, 2014, the WWP reported spending $26 million on ""conferences, conventions, and meetings.""

The group's 990 form also reported the salaries of the now-departed executives, with Nardizzi being paid more than $496,000 and Giordano more than $397,000.

""Former employees say spending has skyrocketed since Steven Nardizzi took over as CEO in 2009,"" CBS News reported. ""Many point to the 2014 annual meeting at a luxury resort in Colorado Springs as typical of his style.""

The report quoted a former employee saying Nardizzi ""rappelled down the side of a building at one of the all hands events. He's come in on a Segway, he's come in on a horse.""

CBS also stated that some 500 staff members attended the Colorado conference, with a total cost of around $3 million.

After those reports aired in late January, the Wounded Warriors Project's board of directors said that they would retain independent advisers ""to conduct a thorough financial and policy review of the concerns.""

Summarizing the review's findings today, the WWP's board also sought to refute or calibrate some of CBS' claims  saying, for instance, that the gathering at the Broadmoor Resort in Colorado didn't cost $3 million but $970,000, and adding, ""such events will be curtailed in the future.""

The group also said that it ""spends 80.6 percent of donations on programming.""

As for the $26 million spent on conferences, the WWP says that its review found ""approximately 94 percent (or approximately $24,392,000) was associated with program services delivered to Wounded Warriors and their families.""

It did not provide details that might substantiate that finding.

While spending rose at the Wounded Warrior Project in recent years, so did the nonprofit's revenue. Data collected by Pro Publica shows that total revenue to the WWP grew from $18.6 million in the financial year ending in 2007 to $342 million in the one ending in 2014.

On the ratings service Charity Navigator, the Wounded Warriors Project earns an overall score of 84.5 out of 100, good for three stars. Breaking down the group's finances, Charity Navigator says that nearly 60 percent is spent on programs and services, with 6 percent going to administrative expenses and 34 percent spent on fundraising.

Revelations about the WWP's spending practices seems to have surprised supporters of the group whose mission is to support severely wounded veterans who served in America's conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.

""It's really unfortunate that wounded veterans will really be hurt by the drop-off in donations to come,"" one man wrote, in what is now the most-liked comment on the group's most recent Facebook posting. ""My checkbook is now closed to this organization.""

Another commenter in that same thread noted the WWP social media representative's responses and stated, ""Stop defending. You've got a lot of housekeeping to do. My suggestion is stop commenting on Facebook and get to work!""",[]

The White House state dinner in honor of Canada's prime minister had an exclusive guest list: Philanthropists, business leaders, political powerhouses, one public radio host, ambassadors, movie stars.

And then, right there between The Honorable Patrick Leahy, U.S. Senator (Vermont) and The Honorable Jacob Lew, Secretary of the Treasury, there she was, with her husband:

Ms. Twila Legare, Letter Writer

Mr. Marc Legare

Who is she? What kind of letter? And to whom?

The mystery seized the attention of the kinds of people who pore over invitation lists for state dinners  that is, reporters.

Twila Legare and her husband live in Las Vegas, where she's an accounts-payable supervisor at the Wynn Las Vegas. She's also currently working on her college degree  which is, in a way, why she was invited to the state dinner.

""I had written the president thanking him for encouraging me to go to school,"" Legare tells NPR, ""which is no easy task for a 60-year-old woman.""

Legare got her associates' degree, and is now working on a bachelor's degree in history. She hopes to start a genealogy business when she retires.

The White House has said that President Obama reads 10 letters a day, out of the abundance of messages sent to him by the public. But while some 3,650 letter-writers who reach the president's desk each year, far fewer have received a state dinner invitation in response.

Most recently, a young environmental scientist named Stephen Chen was invited to a state dinner for Chinese President Xi Jinping after writing a letter thanking Obama for the speech he gave at Chen's graduation, in which the president talked at length about climate change.

""I couldn't get it out of my head that this could potentially be an elaborate hoax,"" Chen wrote. But by the time he and his mom (his date for the night) had dressed up and met Mark Zuckerberg, it was clearly the real deal.

Legare had the same concerns, according to her sister, Darla Mayfield.

""With so many scams today she had to get everything verified first,"" Mayfield told NPR. ""But I am thrilled she got to go to D.C.""

Legare couldn't share more details about her invitation Friday morning; she was busy taking a tour of the Capitol.",[]

Genius and food have a lot in common. Both nurture, inspire, and occasionally intimidate. Some appeal to almost everyone instantly. Others are acquired tastes. So perhaps it's not surprising that, scanning history's greatest minds, we find many were inspired by certain food or drink, repulsed by others or had some very peculiar dining habits.

Thomas Edison used soup as an interviewing tool. He had prospective job applicants taste while he observed them carefully. Those who seasoned the soupwith pepper, for instancebefore tasting it were rejected outright. They had too many assumptions. Then there was the French writer Honore de Balzac, who took coffee addiction to a new level. He would work through the night, downing 50 cups of high-octane espresso. ""This coffee falls into your stomach, and straight away there is a general commotion,"" he wrote in an essay titled ""The Pleasures and Pains of Coffee,"" published in a French magazine in the 1830s. ""Ideas begin to move like battalions of the Grand Army of the battlefield, and the battle takes place."" In the end, it was a battle Balzac would lose. He died at age 51. The cause of death? Caffeine poisoning.

Many geniuses were picky eaters. The Greek mathematician Pythagoras hated beans. He supposedly forbade his followers from eating them, or even touching them. His dislike of legumes may have led to his death. According to legend, when attackers ambushed him, he refused to escape by running through a bean field.

Many geniuses were vegetarians, including Leonardo da Vinci, Gandhi, George Bernard Shaw and the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician Norbert Wiener. Isaac Newtown and Albert Einstein may or may not have been vegetarians. (The record is ambiguous.)

Quite a few geniuses had quirky eating habits. Steve Jobs had some funny ideas about food, as he did about so many things. According to Walter Isaacson's biography of Jobs, the Silicon Valley whiz kid subsisted mainly on dates, almonds and lots of carrots. He supposedly ate so many carrots that ""friends remember him, at times, having a sunset-orange hue,"" writes Isaacson. Later, Jobs embarked on week-long fasts, going about it ""in my usual nutso way,"" he told Isaacson. ""After a week you start to feel fantastic. You get a ton of vitality from not having to digest all this food.""

Jobs wasn't alone in believing that the secret to a creative mind is a sparse diet. Aristophanes, the ancient Greek satirist, attributed the keen Athenian intellect to their low-calorie diet. Michelangelo was indifferent to food and ate ""more out of necessity than pleasure,"" according to his apprentice and biographer Ascanio Condivi. While working on The Last Judgment, he wouldn't eat until the evening, when he was done painting for the day.

On the other end of the spectrum was Ernest Hemingway, who memorialized his gluttonous Paris years in his (posthumously published) memoir, A Movable Feast.

Then there was Charles Darwin. He not only studied exotic animals; he also ate them. While studying at Cambridge University, he headed the Glutton Club, whose members met weekly in order to eat ""strange flesh,"" including owls, hawks, and bittern. Later, aboard the Beagle, he sampled armadillos (which ""taste & look like duck""), iguanas and giant tortoises.

Clearly, food need not be appealing in order to inspire. Friedrich Schiller, the poet and philosopher, always kept a carton of rotten apples under his desk when he wrote. He said it the odor reminded him of the countryside where he grew up.

It might not be food and drink per se that foster creativity but, rather, the conviviality-and intellectual cross-fertilization that a good meal engenders. Take ancient Athens, one of the earliest  and greatest  ""genius clusters"" the world has seen. A centerpiece of city life was the symposia, literally ""drinking together."" Participants spent hours downing diluted wine and discussing philosophy, poetry, or the latest gossip. In 18th century Edinburgh, center of The Scottish Enlightenment, it was an establishment called the Oyster Club that served as intellectual blender. At the time, oysters were considered egalitarian grub, food of the people. The club's founders  economist Adam Smith and philosopher David Hume  consumed bushels of oysters, and cases of claret, while they and the other (all male) members conversed about anything and everything.

Perhaps the greatest example of dining establishment as creativity engine was the Viennese coffee house. During the city's golden age, circa 1900, the coffee house was ""a sort of democratic club, and anyone could join it for the price of a cheap cup of coffee,"" the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig recalls in his wonderful memoir, The World of Yesterday. What exactly did that admission price get you? For starters, a warm room at a time when housing  especially heated housing  was in short supply. It also got you information. Lots of it. The Viennese coffee house was the Internet of its day. They supplied the day's newspapers, carefully mounted on long wooden poles. This is where you went to find out what was happening around the corner, or halfway around the world.

Everyone had a favorite coffee house. For Freud, it was the Cafe Landtmann, a cozy place a short walk from his home-office. (The cafe is still there today, though it's considerably more upmarket than during Freud's day.) Cafe-goers had their Stammtisch, their usual seat. For Freud, it was in a corner facing outward. There, he could sit, undisturbed, sipping his einen kleinen Braunen (short black coffee) and observing the creative milieu unfolding all around him.

Now, you may be asking, where are all the women on this illustrious list? Genius is a social verdict  and up until very recently, the jury has consisted almost entirely of white men. For the most part, history's female geniuses  and their dining peculiarities  have been swept under the table, like so many crumbs. There are notable exceptions, of course: Marie Curie, twice a Nobel Laureate, who, as a broke student in Paris, survived for a while on bread and butter. There is Virginia Woolf, who supposedly demanded perfect table manners from her guests and chided them if they fell short.

And Mozart's older sister, known as Nannerl, was a prodigy in her own right, but, submitting to the era's expectations for women, dropped her musical career when she married. Today, Wolfgang is the toast of classical music. Nannerl is remembered on a bottle of Austrian Schnapps.

Many geniuses were vegetarians, including Leonardo da Vinci, Gandhi, George Bernard Shaw and the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician Norbert Wiener. Isaac Newtown and Albert Einstein may or may not have been vegetarians. (The record is ambiguous.)

Quite a few geniuses had quirky eating habits. Steve Jobs had some funny ideas about food, as he did about so many things. According to Walter Isaacson's biography of Jobs, the Silicon Valley whiz kid subsisted mainly on dates, almonds and lots of carrots. He supposedly ate so many carrots that ""friends remember him, at times, having a sunset-orange hue,"" writes Isaacson. Later, Jobs embarked on week-long fasts, going about it ""in my usual nutso way,"" he told Isaacson. ""After a week you start to feel fantastic. You get a ton of vitality from not having to digest all this food.""

Jobs wasn't alone in believing that the secret to a creative mind is a sparse diet. Aristophanes, the ancient Greek satirist, attributed the keen Athenian intellect to their low-calorie diet. Michelangelo was indifferent to food and ate ""more out of necessity than pleasure,"" according to his apprentice and biographer Ascanio Condivi. While working on The Last Judgment, he wouldn't eat until the evening, when he was done painting for the day.

On the other end of the spectrum was Ernest Hemingway, who memorialized his gluttonous Paris years in his (posthumously published) memoir, A Movable Feast.

Then there was Charles Darwin. He not only studied exotic animals; he also ate them. While studying at Cambridge University, he headed the Glutton Club, whose members met weekly in order to eat ""strange flesh,"" including owls, hawks, and bittern. Later, aboard the Beagle, he sampled armadillos (which ""taste & look like duck""), iguanas and giant tortoises.

Clearly, food need not be appealing in order to inspire. Friedrich Schiller, the poet and philosopher, always kept a carton of rotten apples under his desk when he wrote. He said it the odor reminded him of the countryside where he grew up.

It might not be food and drink per se that foster creativity but, rather, the conviviality-and intellectual cross-fertilization that a good meal engenders. Take ancient Athens, one of the earliest  and greatest  ""genius clusters"" the world has seen. A centerpiece of city life was the symposia, literally ""drinking together."" Participants spent hours downing diluted wine and discussing philosophy, poetry, or the latest gossip. In 18th century Edinburgh, center of The Scottish Enlightenment, it was an establishment called the Oyster Club that served as intellectual blender. At the time, oysters were considered egalitarian grub, food of the people. The club's founders  economist Adam Smith and philosopher David Hume  consumed bushels of oysters, and cases of claret, while they and the other (all male) members conversed about anything and everything.

Perhaps the greatest example of dining establishment as creativity engine was the Viennese coffee house. During the city's golden age, circa 1900, the coffee house was ""a sort of democratic club, and anyone could join it for the price of a cheap cup of coffee,"" the Austrian writer Stefan Zweig recalls in his wonderful memoir, The World of Yesterday. What exactly did that admission price get you? For starters, a warm room at a time when housing  especially heated housing  was in short supply. It also got you information. Lots of it. The Viennese coffee house was the Internet of its day. They supplied the day's newspapers, carefully mounted on long wooden poles. This is where you went to find out what was happening around the corner, or halfway around the world.

Everyone had a favorite coffee house. For Freud, it was the Cafe Landtmann, a cozy place a short walk from his home-office. (The cafe is still there today, though it's considerably more upmarket than during Freud's day.) Cafe-goers had their Stammtisch, their usual seat. For Freud, it was in a corner facing outward. There, he could sit, undisturbed, sipping his einen kleinen Braunen (short black coffee) and observing the creative milieu unfolding all around him.

Now, you may be asking, where are all the women on this illustrious list? Genius is a social verdict  and up until very recently, the jury has consisted almost entirely of white men. For the most part, history's female geniuses  and their dining peculiarities  have been swept under the table, like so many crumbs. There are notable exceptions, of course: Marie Curie, twice a Nobel Laureate, who, as a broke student in Paris, survived for a while on bread and butter. There is Virginia Woolf, who supposedly demanded perfect table manners from her guests and chided them if they fell short.

And Mozart's older sister, known as Nannerl, was a prodigy in her own right, but, submitting to the era's expectations for women, dropped her musical career when she married. Today, Wolfgang is the toast of classical music. Nannerl is remembered on a bottle of Austrian Schnapps.

Genius and food have a lot in common. Both nurture, inspire, and occasionally intimidate. Some appeal to almost everyone instantly. Others are acquired tastes. So perhaps it's not surprising that, scanning history's greatest minds, we find many were inspired by certain food or drink, repulsed by others or had some very peculiar dining habits.

Those who seasoned the soupwith pepper, for instancebefore tasting it were rejected outright. They had too many assumptions. Then there was the French writer Honore de Balzac, who took coffee addiction to a new level. He would work through the night, downing 50 cups of high-octane espresso. ""This coffee falls into your stomach, and straight away there is a general commotion,"" he wrote in an essay titled ""The Pleasures and Pains of Coffee,"" published in a French magazine in the 1830s. ""Ideas begin to move like battalions of the Grand Army of the battlefield, and the battle takes place."" In the end, it was a battle Balzac would lose. He died at age 51. The cause of death?

The White House state dinner in honor of Canada's prime minister had an exclusive guest list: Philanthropists, business leaders, political powerhouses, one public radio host, ambassadors, movie stars.

And then, right there between The Honorable Patrick Leahy, U.S. Senator (Vermont) and The Honorable Jacob Lew, Secretary of the Treasury, there she was, with her husband:

Ms. Twila Legare, Letter Writer

Mr. Marc Legare

Who is she? What kind of letter? And to whom?

The mystery seized the attention of the kinds of people who pore over invitation lists for state dinners  that is, reporters.

Twila Legare and her husband live in Las Vegas, where she's an accounts-payable supervisor at the Wynn Las Vegas. She's also currently working on her college degree  which is, in a way, why she was invited to the state dinner.

""I had written the president thanking him for encouraging me to go to school,"" Legare tells NPR, ""which is no easy task for a 60-year-old woman.""

Legare got her associates' degree, and is now working on a bachelor's degree in history. She hopes to start a genealogy business when she retires.

The White House has said that President Obama reads 10 letters a day, out of the abundance of messages sent to him by the public. But while some 3,650 letter-writers reach the president's desk each year, far fewer have received a state dinner invitation in response.

Most recently, a young environmental scientist named Stephen Chen was invited to a state dinner for Chinese President Xi Jinping after writing a letter thanking Obama for the speech he gave at Chen's graduation, in which the president talked at length about climate change.

""I couldn't get it out of my head that this could potentially be an elaborate hoax,"" Chen wrote. But by the time he and his mom (his date for the night) had dressed up and met Mark Zuckerberg, it was clearly the real deal.

Legare had the same concerns, according to her sister, Darla Mayfield.

""With so many scams today she had to get everything verified first,"" Mayfield told NPR. ""But I am thrilled she got to go to D.C.""

Legare couldn't share more details about her invitation Friday morning; she was busy taking a tour of the Capitol.",[]

The Chicago-based group, known for infusing its psychedelic pop sound with grooves based on reggae and ska, recorded the video in its hometown, where gun violence continues to haunt its residents daily. The video shows guns and ammunition being melted down in a forge and transformed into bells. Singer Natalie Bergman flits between scenes in foundry and the band performing like a spirit of peace and joy, bouncing to the rhythm of the video's peaceful protest.

""If art is political, and the presence of gun violence is all around us, we felt moved to try to do something that brought some of our surrounding communities together, and declared a pro-peace message,"" the Bergmans went on to say. ""It's hard for guns to be a simple metaphor in Chicago. Bells have historically been taken and melted down in times of war to make ammunition. We wanted to show that the process could be reversed and that peace bells could be made out of weapons. These bells will be used to make music, and sounds of peaceful protest.""

Those images of transformation are underlined even further in the chorus, as Natalie's cries of, ""I put my hands up / I put my hands up / Throw down your guns,"" are echoed in the video by the Chicago Children's Choir.

""Thrown Down Your Guns"" will appear on Wild Belle's second album, Dreamland, out April 15 on Columbia.",[]

If the goal on Tuesday is for his GOP rivals to blunt Donald Trump's path toward the Republican nomination, Marco Rubio's campaign has an unusual solution  don't vote for the Florida senator if you live in Ohio.

Alex Conant, Rubio's communications director, admitted on CNN Friday that the best way to stop the real estate mogul in the Buckeye State would be to vote for the state's governor, John Kasich, while Rubio is best positioned to stop Trump in the Sunshine State.

""I'm just stating the obvious,"" Conant argued. ""If you are a Republican primary voter in Ohio and you want to defeat Donald Trump, your best chance in Ohio is John Kasich, because John Kasich is the sitting governor, he's very close to Donald Trump in some of the polls there.""

Rubio later echoed those comments himself at a news conference in West Palm Beach, Fla.

""Clearly, John Kasich has a better chance of winning Ohio than I do, and if a voter concludes that voting for John Kasich is our best chance of stopping Donald Trump, that's what they'll do,"" Rubio said.

Kasich's campaign responded, pointing out that Conservative Solutions PAC, which is backing Rubio, has been blasting Kasich.

""We agree with the Rubio campaign that the best chance to beat Donald Trump in Ohio is by voting for John Kasich, and in that spirit, Sen. Rubio should immediately tell his superPAC to stop attacking the governor,"" Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf said in a statement.

Recent state polls have shown both Rubio and Kasich trailing Trump, though. The March 15 primaries could be the last grasp for those hoping to stop the GOP delegate leader. In the winner-take-all contests, 66 delegates are up for grabs in Ohio while Florida has 99 to win.",[]

i toggle caption Martin Roe/via Getty Images Martin Roe/via Getty Images

Fifteen years ago, Woineshet Zebene Negash of Ethiopia  who was then just 13 years old  was abducted, held captive and raped in order to force her into a marriage to which neither she nor her family had consented.

Hers wasn't an uncommon story: In parts of rural Ethiopia, this is an old cultural practice. Men who've been rejected by a woman or her family often resort to abduction and rape as a way to force a union.

Unlike many others Negash was able to fight back. She reported her assailants to the police, then fought them in court. And when a higher court in Ethopia overturned their indictment without much reason, she  with the help of lawyers from the human rights advocacy group Equality Now  brought the case to the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights.

Earlier this week, the commission ruled that the Ethiopian government had failed to protect her rights. It is requiring the Ethiopian government to pay her $150,000 in reparations  and implement laws to prevent future cases like hers.

The ruling is a resounding affirmation of women's rights, says Christa Stewart, a lawyer with Equality Now who worked on Negash's case.

We asked her to tell us a bit more about the case  and what the ruling will mean for victims of rape and child marriage in Ethiopia.

The interview has been edited for clarity and length.

Why is this case so important?

This is a resounding affirmation of the rights of young girls. The decision looks comprehensively not just at Woineshet's violation but at Ethiopia's larger obligation to deal with these cases of rape and abduction. That means monitoring and then prosecuting such cases, and also training judicial officers in how to handle them. The Commission was very specific asking the Ethiopia to report back in six months about what they have done to remedy the situation so that similar cases won't occur.

Why do men abduct girls for marriage  what's driving this practice?

Oftentimes, this happens because a man who wants to marry a girl cannot afford to pay the necessary dowry. So he and a group of other men will abduct the girl, rape her, and afterwards ask the village elders to approach the girl's family, saying, ""She's no longer a virgin, she's not marriageable to anybody else anymore, so why not consent to this marriage?"" The rapist will promise to apologize and to take care of her. This is a common practice.

What was unusual in Woineshet's case is that the police in this village decided to arrest, prosecute and hold the rapist and his accomplices in the abduction accountable. That was in 2001.

What happened then? Shouldn't the case have ended at that point, 15 years ago?

A few days after the arrest, the men were let out on bail. They abducted her again, and this time they hid her and kept her captive for a month, until she managed to escape and made it to a police station.

During her captivity, the men had forced her to sign a marriage contract  which, of course, is not what we think of as genuine consent.

In 2003, the rapist husband was sentenced to 10 years in jail without parole and his accomplices were sentenced to 8 years.

So they were indicted  or is there more to this story?

The men appealed their cases to an appellate court, and they won.

[The court ruled that ""evidence suggests that the act was consensual,"" without making it clear why.]

And throughout this whole appeals case, there were procedural moves to obstruct justice. The appellate court asked Woineshet to prove she had been a virgin before she had been raped, for example.

Our organization, which was representing Woineshet, appealed further until we exhausted all legal opportunities within Ethiopia. That took several years. Then we brought the case to African Commission on Human and People's Rights.

What does the commission do?

It helps oversee the interpretation and application of the African Charter on Human and People's Rights, which was ratified in 1981 by all 53 states of the African Union. So the commission serves as a higher court for the whole continent of Africa.

Did anything change during the 15 years this case was ongoing?

In the interim, we worked with the Ethiopian Women's Lawyer's Association and did succeed in making some changes in Ethiopia. In 2004, the government enacted stiffer penalties for rape and changed the law so that rapists who married their victims were not exempt from being charged.

But now, thanks to the African Commission's decision, the Ethiopian government has an obligation to protect the rights of young girls like Woineshet.

Her commitment to pursuing justice was remarkable  she stuck with it in spite of all the intimidation she received throughout.

She was persecuted and even threatened with death. She did not feel safe, so she was granted asylum and left the country. In order to protect her safety, we can't say where she is living now.

Michelle Obama and three former first ladies are attending the private funeral service for Nancy Reagan, who died last week at age 94.

Nancy Reagan is being laid to rest today at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., where she will be buried alongside her husband, former President Ronald Reagan, who died in 2004.

""It's a beautiful spot. It's where Ronald Reagan, the former president is buried. Nancy is going to be buried right next to him, which is what she wanted,"" NPR's Nathan Rott reports for the Newscast unit. ""She planned almost every detail of this funeral before her passing.""

Nancy and Ronald Reagan's children, Ronald Prescott Reagan and Patti Davis, were to deliver the eulogies.

The ceremony drew about 1,000 relatives, dignitaries and friends, including former first ladies Hillary Clinton, Rosalynn Carter and Laura Bush. Former President George W. Bush, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Caroline Kennedy were in attendance, as were President Richard Nixon's daughter, Tricia Nixon Cox, and President Lyndon Johnson's daughters Luci Baines Johnson and and Lynda Bird Johnson Robb.

In addition to political figures, Hollywood icons such as Tom Selleck, Wayne Newton, Melissa Rivers, Tina Sinatra, Bo Derek, Ralph Lauren and Mr. T, who was famously photographed dressed as Santa with Nancy Reagan sitting in his lap for her ""Just Say No"" anti-drug campaign in the 1980s.",[]

If the goal on Tuesday is for his GOP rivals to blunt Donald Trump's path toward the Republican nomination, Marco Rubio's campaign has an unusual solution  don't vote for the Florida senator if you live in Ohio.

Alex Conant, Rubio's communications director, admitted on CNN Friday that the best way to stop the real estate mogul in the Buckeye State would be to vote for the state's governor, John Kasich, while Rubio is best positioned to stop Trump in the Sunshine State.

""I'm just stating the obvious,"" Conant argued. ""If you are a Republican primary voter in Ohio and you want to defeat Donald Trump, your best chance in Ohio is John Kasich, because John Kasich is the sitting governor, he's very close to Donald Trump in some of the polls there.""

Rubio later echoed those comments himself at a news conference in West Palm Beach, Fla.

""Clearly, John Kasich has a better chance of winning Ohio than I do, and if a voter concludes that voting for John Kasich is our best chance of stopping Donald Trump, that's what they'll do,"" Rubio said.

Kasich's campaign responded, pointing out that Conservative Solutions PAC, which is backing Rubio, has been blasting Kasich.

""We agree with the Rubio campaign that the best chance to beat Donald Trump in Ohio is by voting for John Kasich, and in that spirit, Sen. Rubio should immediately tell his superPAC to stop attacking the governor,"" Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf said in a statement.

Recent state polls have shown both Rubio and Kasich trailing Trump, though. The March 15 primaries could be the last gasp for those hoping to stop the GOP delegate leader. In the winner-take-all contests, 66 delegates are up for grabs in Ohio while Florida has 99 to win.",[]

i toggle caption Scott Olson/Getty Images Scott Olson/Getty Images

Chicago is having a bloody year.

Already since January, more than 100 people have been murdered in the city  double the number of homicides in Chicago during the first two months last year. The number of shooting incidents is also up by 120 percent compared to the first nine weeks of 2015.

The spike in violent crime comes at a time when the police in Chicago is under increased scrutiny for misconduct.

It started with the release of a video last fall that showed a white police officer shooting a black teenager 16 times, resulting in a Justice Department civil rights investigation into the Chicago Police Department's patterns and practices. Then there were other incidents of police shootings, brutality and misconduct, followed by allegations of officers covering for one another and higher ups failing to hold officers accountable.

In short, the heat and public scrutiny on Chicago police officers right now is intense.

""Well, morale is poor, to describe it in one word,"" says Dean Angelo Sr., president of Chicago's Fraternal Order of Police. ""It's probably the lowest I've seen in my career.""

There is a feeling among police officers, Angelo says, ""that no one wants to be on that next video.""

The 'Laquan McDonald Effect'

The dash cam video released under court order in November showed Officer Jason Van Dyke firing 16 shots into Laquan McDonald as the 17-year-old was moving away from the police while holding a small knife. The incident continues to hamper Chicago police.

Van Dyke was charged with murder  but only hours before the video went public and more than a year after the shooting took place. The political fallout from the video's release amid daily anti-police protests cost police Supt. Garry McCarthy his job.

Interim police Supt. John Escalante acknowledges there might have been a ""Laquan McDonald effect,"" where police officers are less aggressive and even somewhat passive in pursuing criminals.

""There's a little bit of an effect,"" says Escalante. ""Every officer I think, not just here in Chicago, but every police officer around the country does not want to be that next viral video.""

Police in Chicago made 30 percent fewer arrests in the early part of this year compared to last year. Street stops are down more than 80 percent so far this year.

Escalante was so concerned that he recently recorded a video message sent out to all 12,000 Chicago police officers emphasizing that those doing their jobs properly don't have to worry about being that next viral video. He also clarified how officers can continue to make investigative street stops without violating new state laws and announced a landmark agreement with the ACLU designed to prevent racial profiling. As a result, Escalante says both arrests and street stops are now back on the rise.

But the city's sharp increase in violent crime continues unabated.

""The majority of it is still gang violence,"" Escalante says. ""We're seeing a significant percentage of that gang violence being fueled by social media.""

Escalante says social media taunts are the new gang graffiti and in today's gang culture, there are almost immediate, violent responses to those taunts, which in turn spurs retaliatory shootings.

A very mild winter may also be contributing to Chicago's increase in violence. Warmer weather means more people are out and there is more opportunity for conflicts. When temperatures reached the 70s earlier this week, 21 people were shot and two of them were killed in a 20-hour period.

Angelo rejects the notion that the police are somehow responsible for an increase in violent crime, but he says the police are under pressure.

""You know, they're damned when they put people on the wall and search them ... if they have weapons on them, and now they're being blamed for not putting people on the wall to searching them to see if they have weapons on them,"" he says.

Angelo says police officers now are walking what he calls ""a thin blue line"" between protecting law abiding citizens and getting law breakers off the streets. Some cops on the street agree.

""Yeah, (the) job's real tough,"" says 17-year veteran police officer Ron Rewers. ""You know, you got a lot of eyes on you and a lot of people don't understand the job and they want to jump to conclusions about what we do and what we're supposed to do.""

Improving Relations With Chicago Teens

i toggle caption David Schaper/NPR David Schaper/NPR

Rewers is one of several officers from the 12th Chicago police district volunteering on Friday nights to coach a new basketball league for 13- to 15-year-old boys who live in and around the public housing development known as the ABLA homes on the city's west side.

Officer Paris Edwards, another 17-year veteran of the force, came up with the idea for the league as a way to improve relations with teenagers in the neighborhood.

""We've known for quite a while that the relationship between the police and youth has been one that has been strained,"" Edwards says. ""The youth feel like the only time they have interaction with the police is when they're being stopped for questioning or they're being looked at for committing some type of crime.""

Edwards says the goal is to build a little teamwork and trust.

""In basketball, you do have to communicate. Coaches and players have to communicate. If we can get the youth communicating with these officers, then we can develop some type of relationship outside of them being stopped and questioned for some type of crime,"" he says.

Star player Daronte Peterson, 13, says he welcomes the chance to see police officers in a different arena.

""I'm glad they doing this because like, right here where we are at now, it's a very bad neighborhood and I'm glad the police came to do this for us,"" Peterson says.

If the police-led basketball program shows real results in improving relations between beat cops and black teenagers, city officials say it will likely be expanded and replicated across the city.",[]

So why isn't Yorks running in the mile at this weekend's NCAA championships in Birmingham, Ala.?

Nevada's home solar business is in turmoil as the state's Public Utilities Commission starts to phase out incentives for homeowners who install rooftop solar panels. Some of the largest solar companies have stopped seeking new business in the state and laid off hundreds of workers.

Even for small solar installers, this once-booming business has slowed to a trickle. The warehouse at Robco Electric in Las Vegas was filled to capacity with pallets of solar panels stacked high last year. Now, it's nearly empty.

""The PUC made a decision and it just devastated our industry,"" says Robco President Rob Kowalczik. He's all business when talking about how the PUC sided with the utility and pretty much killed off residential solar in Nevada. But when it comes to his workers, he chokes up.

""The hardest thing is to lay people off,"" says Kowalczik. So far, his company has let 25 people go. The solar division of his company is down to a few salespeople and one installation crew.

One of the 25 is Connie Berry. She was just a few months into her job as an installer for Robco. Now, she's looking for work in the construction business, but she holds out hope her solar job will come back.

""It's been two months now since I got laid off, and I was hoping to get a call back. ... I got my tools. I'm ready to go,"" says Berry.

In front of Robco Electric, you're more likely now to see the company's sales cars parked in the middle of the day. Sales and Marketing Manager Tim Webb says last year they would have been out chasing down new leads all day. He says there were a lot of other solar companies on the road too.

i toggle caption Jeff Brady/NPR Jeff Brady/NPR

""It was kind of like the solar gold rush here. All these companies flocked into town, set up an office and sold systems. Now they're gone. There's just a few of us remaining,"" says Webb.

Companies like SolarCity say they were left with no choice but to stop doing business in Nevada when the PUC changed the rules for something called ""net metering.""

Net metering allows a homeowner with solar panels to sell excess electricity they generate to the utility at retail rather than wholesale rates. It's a great deal for a homeowner because they can do something good for the environment and save money on their energy bill.

But every kilowatt generated on someone's roof is one less the local utility sells. And utilities use that ratepayer money to maintain the electrical grid.

In this case, the local utility, NV Energy, is owned by Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway. During an interview with CNBC last month, Buffett echoed an argument utilities across the country have been making: When solar customers don't pay to maintain the power grid, that leaves everyone else to pick up the tab.

""We do not want the non-solar customers, of whom there are over a million, to be subsidizing the 17,000 solar customers,"" Buffett said, talking about NV Energy's customers in Nevada.

i toggle caption Jeff Brady/NPR Jeff Brady/NPR

Buffett said NV Energy can produce solar power from large, centralized plants for less than it costs to buy electricity from rooftop solar customers under the old net metering rules.

""We do not want our million plus customers who do not have solar to be buying solar at 10.5 cents [per kilowatt hour] when we can churn it out for them at 4.5 cents,"" he said.

SolarCity co-founder and CEO Lyndon Rive says utilities like NV Energy are just trying to protect their monopolies.

""They want to deploy the infrastructure. They do not want to let consumers deploy that infrastructure because then they don't get a regulated rate of return on that infrastructure,"" says Rive.

Rive wants big changes for the country's power grid. Instead of central generators delivering electricity out to customers, he imagines a grid where customers produce their own power and compete with the local utility. Under Rive's vision for the grid, there's a smaller role  and less profit  for utilities.

""We need them to manage the lines and let the rest be a competitive market. Competition will drive innovation, which will then create products that we couldn't even think of today,"" he argues.

The big solar companies haven't given up completely on Nevada yet. SolarCity and others plan to challenge the changes to net metering, first in the courts and then with a ballot referendum in November.

i toggle caption Jeff Brady/NPR Jeff Brady/NPR

In the meantime, solar customers like Dale Collier are the big losers. His home in Henderson, outside Las Vegas, has 56 solar panels on the roof. He refinanced his house to pay for them.

""I thought this was [one of] the smartest things I ever did, now I think it might be one of the stupidest things I ever did,"" says Collier.

Up until the changes to net metering in Nevada, he was saving about $150 a month on his power bill. But once the incentives are phased out, he figures having solar panels will cost him money.

NV Energy asked regulators to grandfather in people like Collier. But the PUC rejected that request, saying all solar customers  new and existing  should get the same deal.

The question now is whether Nevada's experience will spread to other states. Solar advocates successfully preserved incentives next door in California. Now they're focused on another sunny state, Arizona, where the next battle over residential solar incentives appears to be heating up.",[]

A controversy over a secretly installed data monitoring system is simmering at university campuses across California.

Last summer, hackers broke into the computer network at the UCLA medical center. A few months later, the University of California system's president quietly ordered a new security system to monitor Internet traffic on all UC campuses.

""And the people who had to put the box in place were ordered to do so and also ordered to keep quiet about it,"" says Ethan Ligon, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of California, Berkeley.

The very substance of higher learning really would not be possible unless the faculty and students have some guarantee of confidentiality that they can pursue perhaps crazy ideas and speak with each other without the fear of the stuff coming back to haunt them.

But they didn't keep quiet: Ligon and other faculty members found out  and were surprised that they weren't consulted.

""There's a long tradition that dates back to the [1930s] at the University of California that gives faculty the right to share in shaping policies at the university, both on the campus and across the UC system,"" Ligon says.

The decision by Janet Napolitano, the university president and a former secretary of homeland security in the Obama administration, is stoking debate over what level of privacy and free speech should be guaranteed to faculty and students at public universities.

The security system ordered by Napolitano not only monitors Internet traffic  it also stores it for at least 30 days. The idea is to allow security personnel to go back through the traffic to look for breaches.

But experts like Vinnie Liu, a senior partner with the Internet security firm Bishop Fox, say this kind of system creates a trove of information for hackers.

""Where you rely on that as a central point of control, if that monitoring system were to be compromised, if it's not deployed correctly or it's not managed correctly, then, yes, it would absolutely be a very bad situation,"" Liu says.

At a recent meeting of the UC Berkeley Graduate Assembly, many students learned about it for the first time. Some, like Andrew Stevens, were not pleased.

""How many people here have research with human subjects where you're ensuring them that your communications are private?"" he asked. ""That information is now sitting in a repository that could be subpoenaed.""

And then Marten Lohstroh  a student in electrical engineering and computer science  raised what was on a lot of students' minds.

""The question I have is, how, as the University of California, did we end up having a president that was the former secretary of homeland security?"" he asked, to laughter.

Last week, the Graduate Assembly passed a resolution in opposition to the University of California Office of the President's ""coordinated monitoring"" activities.

Napolitano was President Obama's secretary of homeland security until 2013. Her office said it did not have anyone available to speak with NPR in time for this broadcast.

But in a letter to university chancellors, Napolitano said her office had no interest in individual emails or browsing history, but that network monitoring is a critical element of cybersecurity.

Christine Borgman, a professor of information studies at UCLA, recently got a chance to meet with representatives from Napolitano's office who stressed the urgency they felt after the UCLA break-in.

""We can certainly understand that you need to scale up your security and you don't want to broadcast exactly what you're doing because you're only going to invite certain kinds of attacks,"" Borgman says. ""But that doesn't mean that we couldn't have talked through more of it as we went.""

But Napolitano presides over a university system with a stormy history around free speech and spying by the federal government  especially at Berkeley, where Eric Brewer is a professor of computer science. He says J. Edgar Hoover spied on Berkeley faculty and students during the Cold War.

""He was worried about Berkeley being a hotbed of communism, and so he felt free rein to monitor what was going on there,"" Brewer says.

Of course, these days most people expect their employers are monitoring them at work. But academia is different, says Barmak Nassirian of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities.

""The very substance of higher learning really would not be possible unless the faculty and students have some guarantee of confidentiality that they can pursue perhaps crazy ideas and speak with each other without the fear of the stuff coming back to haunt them,"" Nassirian says.

But universities are also favorite targets of hackers because of all the personal and professional information on their servers, which means it's going to be tough to balance security, free speech and privacy.",[]

For Natsumi Miyakawa, a young resident of Japan's Tohoku region, March 11, 2011, should have been a day to celebrate. It was her junior high school graduation day.

Instead, there was chaos and sadness. ""Everything was scary,"" she recalls.

In the coastal city of Ishinomaki, where she now lives, 3,700 people drowned in the tsunami. A hilltop saved lives. ""People came to escape to this hill,"" she says. ""And there is a kind of legend that has been passed down generation to generation that said when a tsunami happens, just escape to here.""

In the nearby town where she and her family lived, Miyakawa spent 10 days after the tsunami living in her school's gymnasium, which was turned into an evacuation center. She cleaned toilets and floors, filling buckets with water from the school swimming pool. She helped elderly evacuees who were huddled in the gym.

Her parents had left her alone at the evacuation center as they rushed around the disaster zone, searching for electricity to power the respirator for her brother, who suffers from a heart condition.

""Actually, I didn't want to stop,"" Miyakawa says, ""because once I stopped, I know I would start thinking about really negative things.""

John Roos, the U.S. ambassador to Japan at the time, remembers it well. ""Never, never experienced anything like it,"" he says. ""And hope to never experience anything like it again.""

Roos visited the region soon after the earthquake and tsunami, and remembers a conversation he had with the mayor of Rikuzentakata, another hard-hit town.

""Mayor [Futoshi] Toba said to me, 'Our government is responsible for rebuilding our schools, our houses, our infrastructure. But the one thing that you can do is to provide hope for our younger generation here in the Tohoku region,' "" Roos says.

That conversation sparked a U.S.-Japanese project that continues today  the Tomodachi Initiative, which links the youngest survivors, many of them orphaned by the earthquake and tsunami, with cultural and education opportunities through exchange trips to the U.S.

With fundraising led by the U.S.-Japan Council, Japanese and American-based businesses and organizations have donated $50 million to Tomodachi Initiative programs.

The exchanges send Japanese students to the United States and American students to Japan, for stays ranging from several weeks to full semesters. Volunteers host program participants in their homes.

Of the thousands of young people who have taken part in exchanges, 70 percent are from Japan's hardest-hit Tohoku region. Roos says many students from this part of the country would never otherwise have been able to learn English or spend significant time in the United States.

""The one thing each of those children had in common was that they had suffered a terrible loss,"" Roos says. ""And so, part of it was to just give them a break from the day-to-day lives they were experiencing. But the other was to give them hope about their future.""

Miyakawa is one of the 29,000 individuals who've taken part in the programs or events put on by Tomodachi in the past five years. Now 20, she's pursuing a career in nursing, focused on disaster medicine.

""After the disaster, I realized what it means to help someone,"" she says. ""To do what you can, when you can.""

Through the Tomodachi Initiative's disaster nursing exchange, Miyakawa visited doctors and trauma centers in California and met with federal emergency management experts in Washington, D.C.

""In the future, I want to work all over the world for people fighting or suffering from something,"" she says. ""Like disasters.""

That's an experience she knows and understands all too well. And from that experience comes her hope to help others.

Imagine the worst opera singer ever. Now imagine that she's determined to perform in public. That's the premise of an award-winning French satire that's based on a true story. It's called Marguerite, and it follows a middle-aged socialite by the same name.

Marguerite has very little to do. While the roaring 1920s roar elsewhere and her husband spends all his time with a mistress, Marguerite sits in her Downton Abbey-style mansion outside Paris surrendering her soul to music.

She adores opera, and is wealthy enough that she can sponsor musical recitals for charity with young guest singers. These are invitation-only affairs where her wealthy friends reward her charitable generosity by being charitable about the way she ends the concerts  with her own, shall we say, unique musical stylings. Stylings with no sense of pitch, rhythm or, for that matter, talent.

Marguerite is surrounded by servants who applaud and friends who are polite. (Her husband usually claims car trouble kept him away.) But I hear your question: How could she not know? Wouldn't someone tell her? Here's how it works: After one recital, when a young singer is ushered into Marguerite's presence to say thank you, Marguerite looks up  vulnerable and sweet  and says, ""You heard me miss all my high notes."" The young performer, not wishing to hurt or be impolite, says, ""No, it sounded fine."" Self-knowledge will have to wait.

There were, however, some uninvited guests. A young music critic writes in his paper that Marguerite sang as if she were trying to ""exorcise an inner demon""  innocently, she takes that as praise. There's also an anarchist poet who invites her to perform at a public concert. Marguerite's husband is terrified she'll find out they've all been lying to her, but it's an anarchist performance and she kind of fits right in.

Marguerite's story of misplaced confidence is based loosely on that of Florence Foster Jenkins, an American laughingstock whose ghastly public renditions of some of the same music became a best-selling novelty record in the 1950s. It was called The Glory (????) of the Human Voice.

Meryl Streep will soon play Jenkins in another movie, but it's hard to imagine anyone improving on the mix of hilarity and heartbreak this transplanted, fictional version achieves. As director Xavier Giannoli pushes his leading lady closer and closer to public humiliation, Catherine Frot's Marguerite becomes every bit as haunting as you expect her to be laughable, walking barefoot in the rain after an evening of opera, then squawking in rehearsals like the peacocks that wander her estate's lawn. The more ridiculous Marguerite becomes, the more you want to keep this misguided, innocent, music-besotted creature from being hurt.",[]

Nevada's home solar business is in turmoil as the state's Public Utilities Commission starts to phase out incentives for homeowners who install rooftop solar panels. Some of the largest solar companies have stopped seeking new business in the state and laid off hundreds of workers.

Even for small solar installers, this once-booming business has slowed to a trickle. The warehouse at Robco Electric in Las Vegas was filled to capacity with pallets of solar panels stacked high last year. Now, it's nearly empty.

""The PUC made a decision and it just devastated our industry,"" says Robco President Rob Kowalczik. He's all business when talking about how the PUC sided with the utility and pretty much killed off residential solar in Nevada. But when it comes to his workers, he chokes up.

""The hardest thing is to lay people off,"" says Kowalczik. So far, his company has let 25 people go. The solar division of his company is down to a few salespeople and one installation crew.

i toggle caption Jeff Brady/NPR Jeff Brady/NPR

One of the 25 is Connie Berry. She was just a few months into her job as an installer for Robco. Now, she's looking for work in the construction business, but she holds out hope her solar job will come back.

""It's been two months now since I got laid off, and I was hoping to get a call back. ... I got my tools. I'm ready to go,"" says Berry.

In front of Robco Electric, you're more likely now to see the company's sales cars parked in the middle of the day. Sales and Marketing Manager Tim Webb says last year they would have been out chasing down new leads all day. He says there were a lot of other solar companies on the road too.

""It was kind of like the solar gold rush here. All these companies flocked into town, set up an office and sold systems. Now they're gone. There's just a few of us remaining,"" says Webb.

Companies like SolarCity say they were left with no choice but to stop doing business in Nevada when the PUC changed the rules for something called ""net metering.""

i toggle caption Jeff Brady/NPR Jeff Brady/NPR

Net metering allows a homeowner with solar panels to sell excess electricity they generate to the utility at retail rather than wholesale rates. It's a great deal for a homeowner because they can do something good for the environment and save money on their energy bill.

But every kilowatt generated on someone's roof is one less the local utility sells. And utilities use that ratepayer money to maintain the electrical grid.

In this case, the local utility, NV Energy, is owned by Warren Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway. During an interview with CNBC last month, Buffett echoed an argument utilities across the country have been making: When solar customers don't pay to maintain the power grid, that leaves everyone else to pick up the tab.

""We do not want the non-solar customers, of whom there are over a million, to be subsidizing the 17,000 solar customers,"" Buffett said, talking about NV Energy's customers in Nevada.

Buffett said NV Energy can produce solar power from large, centralized plants for less than it costs to buy electricity from rooftop solar customers under the old net metering rules.

""We do not want our million plus customers who do not have solar to be buying solar at 10.5 cents [per kilowatt hour] when we can churn it out for them at 4.5 cents,"" he said.

SolarCity co-founder and CEO Lyndon Rive says utilities like NV Energy are just trying to protect their monopolies.

""They want to deploy the infrastructure. They do not want to let consumers deploy that infrastructure because then they don't get a regulated rate of return on that infrastructure,"" says Rive.

Rive wants big changes for the country's power grid. Instead of central generators delivering electricity out to customers, he imagines a grid where customers produce their own power and compete with the local utility. Under Rive's vision for the grid, there's a smaller role  and less profit  for utilities.

""We need them to manage the lines and let the rest be a competitive market. Competition will drive innovation, which will then create products that we couldn't even think of today,"" he argues.

The big solar companies haven't given up completely on Nevada yet. SolarCity and others plan to challenge the changes to net metering, first in the courts and then with a ballot referendum in November.

i toggle caption Jeff Brady/NPR Jeff Brady/NPR

In the meantime, solar customers like Dale Collier are the big losers. His home in Henderson, outside Las Vegas, has 56 solar panels on the roof. He refinanced his house to pay for them.

""I thought this was [one of] the smartest things I ever did, now I think it might be one of the stupidest things I ever did,"" says Collier.

Up until the changes to net metering in Nevada, he was saving about $150 a month on his power bill. But once the incentives are phased out, he figures having solar panels will cost him money.

NV Energy asked regulators to grandfather in people like Collier. But the PUC rejected that request, saying all solar customers  new and existing  should get the same deal.

The question now is whether Nevada's experience will spread to other states. Solar advocates successfully preserved incentives next door in California. Now they're focused on another sunny state, Arizona, where the next battle over residential solar incentives appears to be heating up.",[]

Sunny Balzano's modest watering-hole in Brooklyn was a throwback to another time. It was known simply as Sunny's, after the beloved bartender and raconteur who transformed a faded longshoremen's bar into a local institution. He died Thursday at the age of 81, just weeks after the publication of Sunny's Nights, a new book about his life and times.

Sunny was not a master of artisanal cocktails, as he was quick to admit. ""I still don't know how to mix drinks, do I?,"" he joked during an interview at the bar last month. No one disagreed.

The main attraction at the bar was always Sunny himself. He was tall and lanky, his long hair turned silver. Sunny's easy laugh and endless stream of stories drew customers to a remote cobblestone street in Red Hook, Brooklyn. The only signpost was three letters jutting out from the facade: B-A-R.

Writer Tim Sultan first wandered into the bar in the winter of 1995. When he opened the door, he saw a dozen men looking directly at him.

""So I stepped in, and it turned out the reason they were all looking at me was because there was a movie screen right next to the front door,"" he says. ""And they were watching an old movie in black and white. A movie of the Martha Graham Dance Company dancing to Appalachian Spring. And I thought, well, this is a curious, unexpected situation I've stumbled into.""

That was Sultan's first clue this wasn't a typical bar in a rundown neighborhood on the Brooklyn waterfront  and that Antonio ""Sunny"" Balzano was not your average bartender. Whatever skills he might have lacked as a mixologist, Sunny made up for with a steady stream of stories drawn more or less from real life. Like an incident just after his discharge from the Air Force. ""I got shot. But the truth is that I shot myself. And the truth is, it was an accident,"" he said. ""The one time I fired a gun, I shoot myself!""

Sunny was born next door to his family's bar in 1934. The place hasn't changed all that much since. Same long wooden bar, same nautical knick-knacks.

""There's a register at the end of the bar, and that register goes to $1, and there's even a mark on it for one penny,"" Sunny said.

Back in 1934, Red Hook was home to a thriving port and ship-building industry. ""There'd be 10,000 people that worked across the street. We were the closest restaurant and bar. And we were one of I think like 40. This is the only one left of all of the old ones, you see?""

Sunny left Red Hook when he was 17 for the Air Force. Then he tried acting and painting. Lived in India for a while before returning, broke, in the late 1970s. He found the neighborhood in rough shape, too.

""There was a point when I first came back, there were wild dogs in the street,"" Sunny said. ""Every night, every other night, or once a week at least, whoever it was that did that did that would steal cars. And they would burn the cars, on the corner. They would set 'em afire. It was outlaw.""

Sunny's uncle ran the bar then. When he died, Sunny took over. And he closed the bar down  except for Fridays. ""And that one night, folks considered that like a party at Sunny's,"" he said. ""Before it was all men would come, you know. But now they started to bring their girls, and their girls would get dressed up. We had a lot of publicity. My goodness. For this simple thing we were doing. And it was always honest. We didn't do anything to impress anybody, really.""

Just to make a person feel good, better than what it is they felt. That is my job as a bartender. And they become better than what they are, sometimes magnificently better than what they are.

""Without intending to be, Sunny was a shrewd businessman,"" says Sultan. ""Because he understood the truth that the less something is available, the more people will want it.""

Sultan became a regular at Sunny's, then a bartender. Eventually he quit his day job at a magazine, but he kept working at Sunny's. Partly for the money, but mostly to hear Sunny' s stories. Sultan compiled the best of them into his new book, Sunny's Nights. ""Sunny makes for a very striking figure. But he also had a roguish ... uh ... personality,"" Sultan said with a laugh. (To which Sunny shot back: ""I don't know what the hell that means!"")

Sunny's romantic life was complicated. He was married a few times, and divorced. He had some run-ins with mobsters. And with the city of New York over the bar's liquor license. These days, Sunny's is open, legally, six nights a week. The crowd  and the neighborhood  have changed again. You'll find more hipsters than longshoremen. But the bar still reflects the way Sunny looked at life, and his calling.

""Just to make a person feel good, better than what it is they felt. That is my job as a bartender,"" Balzano told me. ""And they become better than what they are, sometimes magnificently better than what they are. Easy to serve a beer. Easy to give away drinks, or to overdose people on alcohol. That's not the point.""

When I met Sunny, the ability to mix a fancy cocktail was still not a requirement to work at Sunny's.

""And they were watching an old movie in black and white. A movie of the Martha Graham Dance Company dancing to Appalachian Spring. And I thought, well, this is a curious, unexpected situation I've stumbled into.""

That was Sultan's first clue this wasn't a typical bar in a rundown neighborhood on the Brooklyn waterfront  and that Antonio ""Sunny"" Balzano was not your average bartender. Whatever skills he might have lacked as a mixologist, Sunny made up for with a steady stream of stories drawn more or less from real life. Like an incident just after his discharge from the Air Force. ""I got shot. But the truth is that I shot myself. And the truth is, it was an accident,"" he said. ""The one time I fired a gun, I shoot myself!""

Sunny was born next door to his family's bar in 1934. The place hasn't changed all that much since. Same long wooden bar, same nautical knick-knacks.

""There's a register at the end of the bar, and that register goes to $1, and there's even a mark on it for one penny,"" Sunny said.

Back in 1934, Red Hook was home to a thriving port and ship-building industry. ""There'd be 10,000 people that worked across the street. We were the closest restaurant and bar. And we were one of I think like 40. This is the only one left of all of the old ones, you see?""

Sunny left Red Hook when he was 17 for the Air Force. Then he tried acting and painting. Lived in India for a while before returning, broke, in the late 1970s. He found the neighborhood in rough shape, too.

""There was a point when I first came back, there were wild dogs in the street,"" Sunny said. ""Every night, every other night, or once a week at least, whoever it was that did that did that would steal cars. And they would burn the cars, on the corner. They would set 'em afire. It was outlaw.""

Sunny's uncle ran the bar then. When he died, Sunny took over. And he closed the bar down  except for Fridays. ""And that one night, folks considered that like a party at Sunny's,"" he said. ""Before it was all men would come, you know. But now they started to bring their girls, and their girls would get dressed up. We had a lot of publicity. My goodness. For this simple thing we were doing. And it was always honest. We didn't do anything to impress anybody, really.""

Just to make a person feel good, better than what it is they felt. That is my job as a bartender. And they become better than what they are, sometimes magnificently better than what they are.

""Without intending to be, Sunny was a shrewd businessman,"" says Sultan. ""Because he understood the truth that the less something is available, the more people will want it.""

Sultan became a regular at Sunny's, then a bartender. Eventually he quit his day job at a magazine, but he kept working at Sunny's. Partly for the money, but mostly to hear Sunny' s stories. Sultan compiled the best of them into his new book, Sunny's Nights. ""Sunny makes for a very striking figure. But he also had a roguish ... uh ... personality,"" Sultan said with a laugh. (To which Sunny shot back: ""I don't know what the hell that means!"")

Sunny's romantic life was complicated. He was married a few times, and divorced. He had some run-ins with mobsters. And with the city of New York over the bar's liquor license. These days, Sunny's is open, legally, six nights a week. The crowd  and the neighborhood  have changed again. You'll find more hipsters than longshoremen. But the bar still reflects the way Sunny looked at life, and his calling.

""Just to make a person feel good, better than what it is they felt. That is my job as a bartender,"" Balzano told me. ""And they become better than what they are, sometimes magnificently better than what they are. Easy to serve a beer. Easy to give away drinks, or to overdose people on alcohol. That's not the point.""

When I met Sunny, the ability to mix a fancy cocktail was still not a requirement to work at Sunny's.

""I trust you. There's something about you that is very trusting. You know, do you want to bartend here? You can bartend here!""

It was a tempting offer. But Sunny Balzano died before I could take him up on it.",[]

English keyboardist and composer Keith Emerson  the artist who defined the sound of Emerson, Lake & Palmer  died yesterday in Santa Monica, California; he was 71 years old. No cause was given for his death, which was confirmed by the band's manager.

Emerson was born at the end of World War II, in Todmorden, Lancashire, on November 2, 1944. He played in blues bands, including backing T-Bone Walker, before forming the keyboard-driven trio The Nice in the late 1960s, where he began experimenting with the sound of the Hammond organ.

As he told Broadway World in 2014, he was really self-taught. But he loved the huge scale of classical music and the improvisation of jazz. And when he heard Wendy Carlos' Switched-On Bach  played on a Moog synthesizer  he immediately bought an instrument and began taking it out on tour.

Emerson co-founded Emerson, Lake & Palmer, which played its first high-profile show at the Isle of Wight Festival in 1970. Though the trio was best known commercially for its song ""Lucky Man,"" Emerson delighted in weaving in quotations from classical composers like Bach, Rachmaninov, Bela Bartok, Alberto Ginastera and Aaron Copland into his music.

With its big, dramatic sound, Emerson, Lake and Palmer was a huge live-concert draw throughout the 1970s, and six of the group's albums went platinum before ELP disbanded in 1979.

In the late 1980s, Emerson regrouped with his former bandmates in two separate projects: Emerson, Lake & Powell with Greg Lake and Cozy Powell, and the band 3 with Lake and Carl Palmer as well as Robert Berry.",[]

In his wide-ranging keynote interview at South by Southwest, the music, film and tech festival in Austin, Texas, President Obama focused on technology's role in civic life.

Obama, who was interviewed by Evan Smith, editor of the Texas Tribune, cited low voter turnout as an area in which technology could improve citizens' participation in government. He said it was ""easier to order a pizza than to vote"" and said we need to think about how to ""redesign our systems so that we don't have 50 percent or 55 percent voter participation in presidential elections.""

Calling on government and private companies to work together, Obama said it's vital to ""create systems that make government more responsive and make it work better.""

When asked about people who are ideologically anti-government, the president pointed to the collective good, saying someone checking the weather on a smart phone is benefiting from government services.

""When government does great things, we take it for granted and it's not a story,"" he said, citing roads, geosatellite systems, armed forces and other public benefits as evidence.

Smith also asked Obama about the ""massive digital divide"" in the U.S., pointing to the fact that minorities have significantly less access to the Internet, which makes it more difficult for them to be engaged citizens or even do their homework.

Obama responded by describing a program called the Opportunity Network, which installs Wi-Fi in low-income housing and rural areas. He acknowledged that this was only part of the answer, saying ""I'm trying to solve every problem.""

But, Obama said, solving problems requires cooperation. He said the country needs to re-imagine the relationship between government and the private sector ""so that we use technology data, social media in order to join forces around problems.""

If the U.S. does that, he said, ""there's no problem that we face in this country that's not solvable.""

At the end of the interview, when asked about the ongoing legal battle between Apple and the FBI over accessing data on the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooters, Obama declined to comment specifically, but urged against ""absolutist"" views on either side of the issue.

The president said that while there must be some concessions to personal privacy (he cited airport security as one such existing concession) he said he was ""way on the civil liberties side"" of the debate. Obama said technology is evolving so rapidly that there are questions being asked now that have never been asked before.

""We're going to have to make some decisions about how we balance these risks,"" he said.",[]

For Natsumi Miyakawa, a young resident of Japan's Tohoku region, March 11, 2011, should have been a day to celebrate. It was her junior high school graduation day.

Instead, there was chaos and sadness. ""Everything was scary,"" she recalls.

In the coastal city of Ishinomaki, where she now lives, 3,700 people drowned in the tsunami. A hilltop saved lives. ""People came to escape to this hill,"" she says. ""And there is a kind of legend that has been passed down generation to generation that said when a tsunami happens, just escape to here.""

In the nearby town where she and her family lived, Miyakawa spent 10 days after the tsunami living in her school's gymnasium, which was turned into an evacuation center. She cleaned toilets and floors, filling buckets with water from the school swimming pool. She helped elderly evacuees who were huddled in the gym.

Her parents had left her alone at the evacuation center as they rushed around the disaster zone, searching for electricity to power the respirator for her brother, who suffers from a heart condition.

""Actually, I didn't want to stop,"" Miyakawa says, ""because once I stopped, I know I would start thinking about really negative things.""

John Roos, the U.S. ambassador to Japan at the time, remembers it well. ""Never, never experienced anything like it,"" he says. ""And hope to never experience anything like it again.""

Roos visited the region soon after the earthquake and tsunami, and remembers a conversation he had with the mayor of Rikuzentakata, another hard-hit town.

""Mayor [Futoshi] Toba said to me, 'Our government is responsible for rebuilding our schools, our houses, our infrastructure. But the one thing that you can do is to provide hope for our younger generation here in the Tohoku region,' "" Roos says.

That conversation sparked a U.S.-Japanese project that continues today  the Tomodachi Initiative, which links the youngest survivors, many of them orphaned by the earthquake and tsunami, with cultural and education opportunities through exchange trips to the U.S.

With fundraising led by the U.S.-Japan Council, Japanese and American-based businesses and organizations have donated $50 million to Tomodachi Initiative programs.

The exchanges send Japanese students to the United States and American students to Japan, for stays ranging from several weeks to full semesters. Volunteers host program participants in their homes.

Of the thousands of young people who have taken part in exchanges, 70 percent are from Japan's hardest-hit Tohoku region. Roos says many students from this part of the country would never otherwise have been able to learn English or spend significant time in the United States.

""The one thing each of those children had in common was that they had suffered a terrible loss,"" Roos says. ""And so, part of it was to just give them a break from the day-to-day lives they were experiencing. But the other was to give them hope about their future.""

Miyakawa is one of the 29,000 individuals who've taken part in the programs or events put on by Tomodachi in the past five years. Now 20, she's pursuing a career in nursing, focused on disaster medicine.

""After the disaster, I realized what it means to help someone,"" she says. ""To do what you can, when you can.""

Through the Tomodachi Initiative's disaster nursing exchange, Miyakawa visited doctors and trauma centers in California and met with federal emergency management experts in Washington, D.C.

""In the future, I want to work all over the world for people fighting or suffering from something,"" she says. ""Like disasters.""

That's an experience she knows and understands all too well. And from that experience comes her hope to help others.

Sunny Balzano's modest watering-hole in Brooklyn was a throwback to another time. It was known simply as Sunny's, after the beloved bartender and raconteur who transformed a faded longshoremen's bar into a local institution. He died Thursday at the age of 81, just weeks after the publication of Sunny's Nights, a new book about his life and times.

Sunny was not a master of artisanal cocktails, as he was quick to admit. ""I still don't know how to mix drinks, do I?,"" he joked during an interview at the bar last month. No one disagreed.

The main attraction at the bar was always Sunny himself. He was tall and lanky, his long hair turned silver. Sunny's easy laugh and endless stream of stories drew customers to a remote cobblestone street in Red Hook, Brooklyn. The only signpost was three letters jutting out from the facade: B-A-R.

Writer Tim Sultan first wandered into the bar in the winter of 1995. When he opened the door, he saw a dozen men looking directly at him.

Last week, Izaic Yorks, a senior at the University of Washington, ran a mile in 3:53  the fastest college mile ever by an American. The effort qualifies him for the Olympic trials this summer.

So why isn't Yorks running in the mile at this weekend's NCAA championships in Birmingham, Ala.?

Turns out, he had to make a decision: run that mile alone, or run with his team in the distance medley relay or DMR.

If he decided to run the mile race, he would have been required to run a preliminary round right before the DMR  compromising his team's shot at a national title.

Yorks recalls when his coach, Greg Metcalf, pulls him aside to ask what he thinks about running the mile race.

""I was just, no way. I want to do the DMR,"" Yorks replied. ""That's what I told these guys I would do. And I'm gonna stick to that word.""

Metcalf continues.

""I'm sitting in my office on Sunday, making our declarations,"" Metcalf says. ""And I hit the 'scratch' button next to Izaic's name, next to 3:53, I think, 'Am I the biggest idiot of all time?'""

Maybe. But in a sport that so often celebrates individual glory, Yorks is not only very fast, he's also very loyal.",[]

And that might put animal lovers in a bit of a tight spot  because P-22 is the prime suspect in a koala killing.

Killarney, a 14-year-old female koala at the Los Angeles Zoo, went missing on March 3.

Staff members immediately set out in search of her, the zoo says  but found only, well, parts.

The zoo can't prove that P-22 did the deed. But they have their suspicions ...

""There is no definite photo or video evidence that P-22, the mountain lion that lives in Griffith Park, was the cause of her disappearance, but the mountain lion was seen on Zoo surveillance footage on grounds the night before she died,"" the zoo said in a statement.

And there was an 8-foot wall around the koala enclosure, Reuters reports, which suggests only a large predator could have jumped in, grabbed a 15-pound koala and jumped out.

The zoo is located on the edge of Griffith Park, P-22's home range. A deputy mayor for city services said in a statement ""these types of incidents happen when we have a zoo in such close proximity to one of the largest urban parks in the country,"" the wire service reports.

The parody account for P-22 has already responded, of course:

Meanwhile, in more official outlets, the koala's death has inspired varying reactions, the LA Times writes.

A National Park Service official noted that household pets  and exotic zoo animals  should all be in ""safe enclosures"" or inside at night, and that P-22 would have been behaving normally if he preyed on a koala.

But one LA city councilman said P-22 ought to be relocated.

For their own safety, the remaining 10 koalas have been transferred indoors, the zoo says.

Hillary Clinton apologized on Friday after she called the late Nancy Reagan a ""very effective, low-key"" advocate on HIV/AIDS awareness.

The Democratic presidential candidate now says she ""misspoke"" when she told MSNBC during Reagan's funeral that the former first lady and her husband, President Ronald Reagan, pushed for recognition of the disease in the national community.

""It may be hard for your viewers to remember how difficult it was for people to talk about HIV-AIDS back in the 1980s. And because of both president and Mrs. Reagan  in particular Mrs. Reagan  we started a national conversation,"" Clinton said.

""When before nobody would talk about it, nobody wanted to do anything about it, and that too is something that I really appreciate with her very effective, low-key advocacy, but it penetrated the public conscious, and people began to say, 'Hey, we have to do something about this, too.'""

However, it wasn't until 1987 that President Reagan gave his first speech on the topic, calling for more testing (but not making it mandatory). At that time, according to the New York Times, there had been nearly 36,000 cases of AIDS and nearly 21,000 deaths. Reagan has been roundly criticized for not doing enough to educate the public and draw attention to the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic during his administration.

Clinton released a statement hours later, apologizing for her remarks.

Even Clinton supporters were up in arms over her ill-phrased comments.

i toggle caption Gerry Broome/AP Gerry Broome/AP

Call it Mega Tuesday. Only Super Tuesday (March 1) had more delegates at stake on a single day than the upcoming contests on Tuesday. More than 1,000 delegates are up for grabs  and the results will be pivotal.

The biggest prizes on the GOP side are the winner-take-all states of Florida and Ohio. On the Democratic side, which still awards delegates proportionally, it's Florida and Illinois, followed by Ohio.

What's at stake for Republicans?

If Donald Trump sweeps the winner-take-all states of Ohio and Florida, it could be a wrap party for his nomination as the Republican standard-bearer.

To be clear, Trump won't mathematically clinch Tuesday even with wins in both places. But the odds that anyone else could go into the convention with a majority  or even most  of the delegates would be almost impossible. It will mean the only way Trump wouldn't be the nominee is if he's stopped at a historic and chaotic brokered convention.

As it stands now, Trump is favored in both Florida and Ohio, but Marco Rubio and John Kasich are hoping their respective home states put them over the top. There is some evidence of momentum for Kasich in Ohio, where he's a popular governor. One poll showed him in the lead this past week. Rubio's campaign is even telling people to vote for Kasich in Ohio, following a plan laid out by Mitt Romney designed to try and stop Trump from getting a majority before the convention.

Florida has been trending the other direction, with Trump favored. Rubio is running zero ads, and Ted Cruz has made a late play in the state. If Rubio loses Florida, it's likely lights out for his campaign. If Kasich loses Ohio, his chances of winning the nomination are severely diminished from what's already something unlikely to happen. It could also be the end of his candidacy, considering the next contest where he could contest wouldn't be for three weeks in Wisconsin.

Side note: Don't overlook the contests in Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, which, combined, actually have more delegates than Florida and Ohio put together. Since they are not winner-take-all, though, no one is going to net the margins there that they could in either Florida or Ohio.

What's at stake for Democrats?

These are the first major contests following Bernie Sanders' surprise win over Hillary Clinton in Michigan. It was apparently the biggest polling upset in history. It also showed Sanders can win in a big, diverse state.

But it didn't change one thing  the math. Clinton remains the favorite for the nomination because of her delegate lead and because Democrats award delegates on a proportional basis. Despite the potentially narrative-changing win in Michigan, Sanders woke up further behind, because Clinton had won such a huge margin in Mississippi. Sanders now needs 54 percent of remaining pledged delegates for a pledged-delegate majority. With superdelegates factored in, he needs 60 percent.

Math aside, Tuesday is important, though. If Sanders can pull off more surprise wins in these big states, Clinton will look vulnerable. Superdelegates could switch their allegiance, and Clinton will have her back against the wall. The last thing she wants is to limp to the nomination. She needs to show strength Tuesday.

Sanders believes, after Michigan, that his message on trade has resonance in the Upper Midwest, meaning states like Illinois and Ohio could line up well for him.

One thing already appears clear, however  no one on either side is going to get a majority of delegates for months.

Key Questions Answered About Mega Tuesday

How many delegates are at stake? 1,058 pledged delegates for Republicans and Democrats combined. If the 102 unpledged delegates, or superdelegates, are added in, the total rises to 1,160.

How many states? Five, plus one territory: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri and the Northern Mariana Islands (on the Republican side; the islands vote Saturday for Democrats).

Why is March 15 a big deal? It could be decisive for both parties. Also, not only are there a lot of delegates at stake, but it's also the day when the contest rules change for the Republicans. States can start to pick how they want to award their delegates. For both Florida and Ohio, that means winner-take-all.

What's happened since Super Tuesday? A lot!

March 5 and 6:

Democrats: Sanders won the caucuses in Maine, Kansas and Nebraska. Clinton won by a huge margin in the Louisiana primary.

GOP: Cruz won the most delegates with wins in Kansas and Maine. Trump pulled off narrow victories in Louisiana and Kentucky. Rubio won the Republican primary in Puerto Rico Sunday by more than 50 percent of the vote, giving him all 23 delegates (which, by the way, is as many delegates as in New Hampshire).

March 8:

Democrats: Sanders won Michigan after going into the primary polling way behind Clinton. Clinton won Mississippi by 60 points and gave her the most delegates that day despite Sanders' narrative-changing Michigan win.

GOP: Trump won Hawaii, Michigan and Mississippi; Cruz won Idaho; Marco Rubio didn't score double digits in Mississippi or Michigan and placed third in Hawaii and Idaho.

What is the current delegate count?

Republicans:

Trump 459

Cruz 360

Rubio 152

Kasich 54

Democrats:

Clinton 1,223 total (762 pledged + 461 superdelegates)

Sanders 574 total (549 pledged + 25 superdelegates)

""My career with the Navy and NASA gave me an incredible chance to showcase public service to which I am dedicated, and what we can accomplish on the big challenges of our day. I am humbled and excited by new opportunities for me to support and share the amazing work NASA is doing to help us travel farther into the solar system and work with the next generation of science and technology leaders,"" he said.

Kelly was selected by NASA in 1996, flew in space four times, and currently holds the American record for most time spent in space  520 days.

His record-breaking extended space flight, from which he returned earlier this month, was aimed at understanding how long periods of time in space affect the body. His twin brother, former astronaut Mark Kelly, served as the control variable for studying changes in Scott's body.

Also providing data for scientists was cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko, who launched and returned with Kelly.

""Scott's contributions to NASA are too many to name,"" said Brian Kelly, director of Flight Operations at NASA's Johnson Space Center in the statement. ""In his year aboard the space station, he took part in experiments that will have far-reaching effects, helping us pave the way to putting humans on Mars and benefiting life on Earth.""

NASA administrator Charles Bolden offered his thanks to Kelly:

""All of us in the NASA family  and indeed in the broader scientific community  are grateful that he was willing to sacrifice time with his loved ones, meals that don't come in a bag, a cold beer, hot showers, cool autumn breezes, the sounds of birds chirping, the ability to lay his head on an actual pillow and so much more of the pleasures of life during his year of research and experimentation the International Space Station.""

Hillary Clinton apologized on Friday after she called the late Nancy Reagan a ""very effective, low-key"" advocate on HIV/AIDS awareness.

The Democratic presidential candidate now says she ""misspoke"" when she told MSNBC during Reagan's funeral that the former first lady and her husband, President Ronald Reagan, pushed for recognition of the disease in the national community.

""It may be hard for your viewers to remember how difficult it was for people to talk about HIV-AIDS back in the 1980s. And because of both president and Mrs. Reagan  in particular Mrs. Reagan  we started a national conversation,"" Clinton said.

""When before nobody would talk about it, nobody wanted to do anything about it, and that too is something that I really appreciate with her very effective, low-key advocacy, but it penetrated the public conscious, and people began to say, 'Hey, we have to do something about this, too.'""

However, it wasn't until 1987 that President Reagan gave his first speech on the topic, calling for more testing (but not making it mandatory). At that time, according to the New York Times, there had been nearly 36,000 cases of AIDS and nearly 21,000 deaths. Reagan has been roundly criticized for not doing enough to educate the public and draw attention to the growing HIV/AIDS epidemic during his administration.

Clinton released a statement hours later, apologizing for her remarks.

Even Clinton supporters were up in arms over her ill-phrased comments.

Former Clinton White House aide and Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, whose organization has endorsed Clinton, tweeted the former first lady was ""no hero"" on the issue.

In his wide-ranging keynote interview at South by Southwest, the music, film and tech festival in Austin, Texas, President Obama focused on technology's role in civic life.

Obama, who was interviewed by Evan Smith, editor of the Texas Tribune, cited low voter turnout as an area in which technology could improve citizens' participation in government. He said it was ""easier to order a pizza than to vote"" and said we need to think about how to ""redesign our systems so that we don't have 50 percent or 55 percent voter participation in presidential elections.""

Calling on government and private companies to work together, Obama said it's vital to ""create systems that make government more responsive and make it work better.""

When asked about people who are ideologically anti-government, the president pointed to the collective good, saying someone checking the weather on a smart phone is benefiting from government services.

""When government does great things, we take it for granted and it's not a story,"" he said, citing roads, geosatellite systems, armed forces and other public benefits as evidence.

Smith also asked Obama about the ""massive digital divide"" in the U.S., pointing to the fact that minorities have significantly less access to the Internet, which makes it more difficult for them to be engaged citizens or even do their homework.

Obama responded by describing a program called the Opportunity Network, which installs Wi-Fi in low-income housing and rural areas. He acknowledged that this was only part of the answer, saying ""I'm trying to solve every problem.""

But, Obama said, solving problems requires cooperation. He said the country needs to re-imagine the relationship between government and the private sector ""so that we use technology data, social media in order to join forces around problems.""

If the U.S. does that, he said, ""there's no problem that we face in this country that's not solvable.""

At the end of the interview, when asked about the ongoing legal battle between Apple and the FBI over accessing data on the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooters, Obama declined to comment specifically, but urged against ""absolutist"" views on either side of the issue.

The president said that while there must be some concessions to personal privacy (he cited airport security as one such existing concession) he said he was ""way on the civil liberties side"" of the debate. Obama said technology is evolving so rapidly that there are questions being asked now that have never been asked before.

""We're going to have to make some decisions about how we balance these risks,"" he said.",[]

Florida may be Sen. Marco Rubio's home turf, but it's also friendly terrain for his rival Donald Trump. On Friday morning, Trump began his day with a press conference at his luxurious Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. Less than four days earlier, he had given a press conference at another one of his Florida properties  the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter.

In Florida, it seems Trump's presidential campaign is seemingly everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Trump is on TV non-stop. And, yet his campaign infrastructure has always been a bit of a mystery.

Trump's ground operation may not be as visible as a traditional campaign, but it's been operating in Florida for months.

""No other campaign's been on the ground because they've been focused on other states, and they haven't been able to have the resources here, but since October Donald Trump's been moving forward,"" said Joe Gruters, Trump's Florida co-chair, who's also the vice-chair of Florida Republican Party.

Trump made his first Florida hire in October of last year  Karen Giorno, who had previously handled external affairs for Florida's Gov. Rick Scott.

He also brought on the former data director for the state Republican party. And, he all-but-has the endorsement of the governor, who wrote an op-ed in USA Today that claimed ""Donald Trump has America's pulse.""

Gruters says Trump has another distinct advantage in Florida.

""This is his second home, he could be called a Floridian,"" said Joe Gruters. ""The guy's invested tens of millions of dollars in businesses here. He's attended local Republican events across the state for years, and really built some solid relationships early on.""

Some analysts say Trump's initial Florida strategy was focused on Jeb Bush, but now, with Bush out of the race, he has the tools to refocus on Rubio.

To date, the campaign only has two brick-and-mortar offices in the state, according to Gruters. Much of the operation seems slightly ad-hoc, as Trump supporter Richard DeNapoli explained.

""They hold these organizational meetings, usually at a restaurant that has a private room, something like that,"" said DeNapoli, the former chairman of the Broward County Republican party. ""So, at that meeting, they have a three-minute video that teaches you to how to use the calling program where you can make calls from home on behalf of the Trump campaign.""

It's akin to traditional phone banking with a twist that resembles The Apprentice.

""Usually we do a contest for whoever the person in each county who does the most calls  then they get a meeting with Donald Trump,"" explained DeNapoli with a laugh.

At a recent Trump volunteer training, about 20 supporters gathered at a wings restaurant in Hollywood, Fla. Linda Schainberg, a 53-year-old Trump volunteer, discussed the importance of sign waving at the early polling sites.

Other folks explained the weekend plans for door knocking and phone banking  all traditional campaign strategy with one exception  there was actually no staff on hand; it was an entirely volunteer force.

""I try and hold a weekly event here to bring volunteers together to help Donald Trump win the presidency,"" explained Schainberg, sporting a Trump T-shirt and a matching Trump button.

Rubio's Home Turf?

Marco Rubio was supposed to have a built-in advantage, as the local-boy-turned-presidential-candidate. He's the native son in this story. He was born in Miami, played football at a Miami high school, and currently represents the state as a senator.

And, with Jeb Bush now out of the presidential race, Rubio has the backing of the GOP elite in the state. Local papers and politicians have endorsed him (though notably, Jeb Bush has remained silent.)

But even though Florida may be Rubio's backyard, analysts say he got a late start. He hasn't been on the ground as early and as frequently as he ought to have been. And, for months, Miami itself was largely the domain of the Bush headquarters.

Rubio was running his campaign out of Washington, D.C., and only began opening offices in Florida around Super Tuesday early this month.

His campaign insists they've been operating on a grassroots level for months.

""We've had a call-from-home program even before we had offices,"" said Alex Burgos, a spokesman and adviser with the Rubio campaign.

At Rubio's local Miami office, people crowd into a room to make calls in English and Spanish  it seems like a strong, old-school ground game.

""What we've been doing here is get out the vote calls, working the absentee ballots, encouraging people to go vote early,"" said Burgos. ""This is Marco's hometown base, this is Marco's geographic base. We want to make sure there is strong turnout throughout Florida, but especially among the people who know him best in South Florida.""

South Florida is home to a large number of Republican Cuban-Americans the campaign is hoping to galvanize.

""We have teams walking in important neighborhoods ... a great deal of the suburban areas that have a large Cuban-American population,"" explained Armando Ibarra, a Miami co-chair for Rubio.

Ibarra also points out that Rubio has won a tough election before in Florida, and he knows what to do.

""He won a statewide campaign in 2010, which means he had to build a statewide operation and churn out these voters,"" said Ibarra.

These days, Rubio is campaigning non-stop with no intention of leaving the state until the primary is over.

""I need your help. We have to win here in Florida, it was always going to come down to Florida,"" Rubio told a few hundred voters in the overwhelmingly Hispanic city of Hialeah earlier this week.

Rubio was pleading for their support.

""If everyone here votes and finds others who will vote. If those of you who haven't voted, will leave here now and go a few blocks away and cast your early ballot, we are going to win this election,"" Rubio said.

The Ted Cruz Factor

But, Rubio has another obstacle. The Cruz campaign says it has opened ten offices across the state, including one in Rubio's backyard  Miami.

Cruz isn't expected to win Florida, but he wants to ensure that Marco Rubio doesn't either. At a campaign rally in Miami this week, the Texas senator played up his Cuban roots and insisted he's the only viable alternative to Trump.

""At this point, our campaign has beaten Donald Trump not once, not twice, not three times, but eight separate times,"" Cruz told the crowd.

And, on Friday, all three men  Cruz, Trump and Rubio  held campaign events in Florida. The action on the ground before March 15 is important, but any last-minute ground game is limited, because of the popularity of early voting in Florida.

Analysis from the University of Florida's Daniel Smith shows that already about a million Republicans have cast their ballots, and 42 percent of them were newcomers  people who did not participate in Florida's 2012 presidential primary.",[]

The two members of Birds of Chicago, Allison Russell and JT Nero, used to cross paths on the road when on tour with their own bands. They joined up musically and then  as these things happen  they became a couple. Their latest album, out now, is called Real Midnight.

The two characterize much of their music as ""secular gospel""  earthly tunes that have the power to connect people. They spoke with NPR's Melissa Block about the inspiration behind some of their songs, and how they balance parenting with touring. Hear the radio version at the audio link and read more of their conversation below.

Melissa Block: You call your music ""secular gospel."" I wonder what that means to each of you?

JT Nero: We do take a lot from the gospel world. There's that very basic sense in gospel where the more beautiful your words and music, the closer you are to God. You know, that's the mission when it comes down to it, for us, if you want to call it the secular rising of that. It starts with that basic idea: If we can tap into some words and music that have a certain grace and power, then we can get closer to each other. That's the vehicle that we know to open up those kinds of channels of love that I don't know how to get at in another way.

That sounds like a really powerful connection that you're trying to get, there.

Nero: I still have a certain amount of faith in the notion that words tied to melodies ... that there's kind of a collective consciousness in humans, that we connect through song in a way that is not afforded to us in other avenues.

YouTube

Allison Russell: Yeah, I think there's just a really visceral, deep, emotional connection that can happen with music. My grandmother had Alzheimer's, and eventually died of it. But I remember, shortly before her death in 2006  language was gone, she didn't know who we were, but if I sang her songs that she had sung to me as a child, songs that were from her childhood as well, she could sing with me. That really struck me. You know, I'm not by any means an expert on the neuroscience of music, but it taps into literally a different part of our brains and psyches. I was so struck by that with my grandma, and that was one way that we could still connect. Everything was fear and confusion for her at that point, but when we sang together she sort of came back to us.

Is that where the song ""Barley"" came from?

Russell: Definitely, that song is inspired by her and that experience. She had a wealth of traditional British Isles tunes and songs that came out of the oral tradition. ""Barely"" is definitely influenced by the things that she taught me, the songs. And she was quite an amazing lady.

Let's shift gears just a little bit and bring this back down to a real carnal level with the song ""Estrella Goodbye."" JT, when you're writing this song  if you're getting all spiritual and highfalutin in other songs, this must be just pure release, right? Just to write something sexy and fun.

Nero: Well it's the same deal, it's just a different take on it. You know, time is the enemy. I have sort of a genre in my head, what I think of as ""apocalyptic party jams"": where you're somewhat aware of time, darkness, shadows encroaching, but that just makes you really dig in on the good times. Exhibit A is Sam Cooke, ""Good Times."" You know, ""It might be one o'clock, it might be three / Time don't mean that much to me / I've felt this good since I don't know when / and I might not feel this good again."" You know, like that.

The two of you spend a huge amount of time touring on the road, and I wonder if there are times where you wish you had more separation between your musical life and your home life.

Nero: I think being on the road has become our natural state.

Russell: Our daughter is 2 now, and she's been on the road her whole life, so it's her normal and natural rhythm as well. But as she gets older and closer to school age  for me, I would love to knock it back to maybe seven months of the year.

What do you think you are going to do when she does go to school?

Russell: We may delay when she begins school, we might wait until she's 

Nero: Seventeen. [Laughs]

Russell: No, not that long! But we may home-school until she's about 6 or 7. I mean, we're not settled on this yet  we'll have to play it by ear and see how she feels. But we're very, very lucky: JT's mom and dad are very hands-on, loving grandparents, so there may be times where we go out and she stays, or comes to join us on a weekend. We're going to be sort of playing that by ear and figuring it out as we go.",[]

Those novels returned to the WWI period setting of Barker's acclaimed Regeneration Trilogy, so Noonday represents her first fictional foray into World War II. The results are stirring.

Although this novel may be read as a stand-alone, fans of Life Class and Toby's Room will enjoy being reunited with Elinor Brooke, a painter whose talent has landed three of her canvases at the Tate. This being wartime, Elinor has put away her brushes to drive an ambulance at the Tottenham Court Road depot. Increasingly estranged from her husband Paul, also an artist, she harbors a long-simmering attraction to old art-school flame Kit Neville. The novel plumbs the intricacies of their relationship over the course of late summer and early fall 1940, as the 500-pounders pummel London from above.

Some of their passions have the cheap feel of a soap opera. When Elinor sits down for one of her regular heart to hearts with Paul or Kit you can almost see the bubbles rise in the room. Much of the story was too weepy for me; I would have found a drier approach to its people more believable, and more enjoyable. But the dominant character here is the Blitz itself, and in its portrayal Barker delivers her most affecting storytelling.

It's no mean feat to match the horror of a historical experience with horrific language and not go over the top into fright-show territory. Often enough, Pat Barker walks this line with sensory-thick language; its sweep makes us truly appreciate life and death in a decimated landscape.

War images are searing (literally, as fires burn everywhere, day and night), as well as up close and personal. ""The change was in the sky: beyond the black ridges of the rooftops, a red, sullen glare was growing and spreading, lit at intervals by the orange flashes of exploding bombs."" We smell the foul interiors of overnight shelters. We hear the crunch of glass underfoot as the shell-shocked denizens emerge from behind blackout curtains to kill the horror with glasses of sweet, numbing whisky. And we see oily smoke drifting over black roads, and bodies lying in the gutters ""like sodden heaps of rags.""

Noonday gives us bravery among the ruins: Elinor must leave her house when it is crushed by a bomb. The face of Kit Neville, who longs for their former passion, was ravaged in the last war and has been sewn together in a patchwork of pain. The women of the ambulance corps plaster themselves with cosmetics to offset the gray dust on their faces, the under-eye circles of exhaustion. Some of these scenes are as casual as they are unforgettable: A man's head rests upon a concrete sidewalk, ""severed neatly at the neck, one eye closed."" A child simply kicks it aside.

Effortlessly delivering beautiful toss-off sentences, Barker effectively captures the time and place: ""Even the roses, this summer, looked as if they were expecting to be bombed."" Her evocative language applies to more intimate personal matters, too  as her mother's heart beats its last, Elinor ""could almost believe she saw the dark, struggling muscle laboring away inside its cage of bone.""

Some of the language becomes bruise-purple; readers might not want to hear quite so much sentiment along the lines of ""Nightmares crawled across each other like copulating toads."" It's no mean feat to match the horror of a historical experience with horrific language and not go over the top into fright-show territory. Often enough, Pat Barker walks this line with sensory-thick language; its sweep makes us truly appreciate life and death in a decimated landscape: ""London: no longer one of the world's great centers of civilization, but merely a settlement on a river, lit by guttering candles after dark.""

One dog has been killed and multiple dogs have been injured by a snowmobiler in what appears to be an intentional attack on competitors in the Iditarod Race in Alaska.

Iditarod veteran Aliy Zirkle was the first to report an attack.

A snowmachiner had ""repeatedly attempted to harm her and her team,"" the Iditarod Trail Committee says, and one of Zirkle's dogs had received a non-life-threatening injury.

Zirkle reported the attack when she arrived in Nulato, Alaska, in the wee hours of the morning, and race officials and law enforcement were notified.

Then Jeff King, a four-time Iditarod champion who was behind Zirkle, reported a similar encounter.

King's team was hit by a snowmobiler, injuring several dogs and killing one  Nash, a 3-year-old male.

Zachariah Hughes, a reporter for Alaska Public Radio and KSKA, says that neither King nor Zirkle were injured, according to state troopers.

A suspect has been identified, race officials say, and an investigation has begun.

""Regrettably, this incident very much alters the race of the two mushers competing for a win,"" the Trail Committee writes. ""However, both are going to continue on their way toward Nome.""

After a four-hour rest, Zirkle left Nulato  leaving one dog behind  in third place. King is still at the checkpoint as of 1 p.m. Eastern.

Reporter Emily Schwing says on Twitter that Jeff King explained, ""I'm not gonna let this schmuck take any more of the fun away.""

Five candidates for president weighed in on the violent clashes in Chicago at a planned Friday night rally for Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.

The event was eventually canceled by the Trump campaign after protesters and attendees squared off on the campus of the University of Illinois-Chicago.

Ohio Gov. John Kasich stated he may not support Trump should the businessman become the GOP nominee, according to The Associated Press.

He said during a stop in Cincinnati that there's ""no place for a national leader to prey on the fears of people.""

""America is better than this. We don't have to tear each other apart,"" Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said. ""When you have a campaign that disrespects the voters, when you have a campaign that affirmatively encourages violence, when you have campaign that is facing allegations of physical violence against members of the press, you create an environment that only encourages this sort of nasty discourse.""

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told reporters Saturday that he still intended to support the nominee, ""but it's getting harder every day.""

On the Democratic side, Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign stated on Twitter that they ""will not allow the Donald Trumps of the world to divide us up,"" and posted a campaign ad about unifying the country.

Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton released a statement Friday night calling for people to ""address that anger together,"" and saying that ""violence has no place in our politics.""

Five people were arrested Friday night, including a CBS News reporter who was charged with resisting arrest. CBS News said reporter Sopan Deb, who has been covering the Trump campaign since last summer, was thrown to the ground and handcuffed.

The arrest was captured on video which, CBS News states, proves the reporter did not resist officers.

Chicago police said two officers were injured on Friday night. They were taken to a hospital and released, according to The Associated Press.

Trump makes first statement since Friday night's violence

In his first public appearance since the events in Chicago, Trump spoke to a large crowd in Vandalia, Ohio.

He blamed ""professional protesters"" and ""thugs"" for inciting the crowd. He also noted some of the protesters were supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, and he also blamed President Barack Obama for dividing the country.

At one moment during his speech, Secret Service agents quickly surrounded Trump. The Associated Press has more:

A group of U.S. Secret Service agents briefly formed a protective ring around Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at his rally in Ohio, but then quickly left the stage and allowed him to continue his speech. It was not immediately clear why the agents rushed onto the stage Saturday morning to surround Trump, who appeared to jolt after hearing something in the audience standing behind his right shoulder. Four Secret Service agents then rushed onto the stage, as the audience chanted ""Trump! Trump! Trump!"" The agents quickly cleared. Trump did not explain what had happened, but said: ""Thank you for the warning. I was ready for 'em, but it's much better if the cops do it, don't we agree?""

A man attempting to rush the stage was charged with disorderly conduct and inducing panic, according to NBC News, citing local police.

Trump continued the charged rhetoric, stating at one point that any protesters should be thrown ""the hell out."" He also cited the First Amendment, stating that he and his supporters have a right to say what they want and to be heard.

The two members of Birds of Chicago, Allison Russell and JT Nero, used to cross paths on the road when on tour with their own bands. They joined up musically and then  as these things happen  they became a couple. Their latest album, out now, is called Real Midnight.

The two characterize much of their music as ""secular gospel""  earthly tunes that have the power to connect people. They spoke with NPR's Melissa Block about the inspiration behind some of their songs, and how they balance parenting with touring. Hear the radio version at the audio link and read more of their conversation below.

Melissa Block: You call your music ""secular gospel."" I wonder what that means to each of you?

JT Nero: We do take a lot from the gospel world. There's that very basic sense in gospel where the more beautiful your words and music, the closer you are to God. You know, that's the mission when it comes down to it, for us, if you want to call it the secular rising of that. It starts with that basic idea: If we can tap into some words and music that have a certain grace and power, then we can get closer to each other. That's the vehicle that we know to open up those kinds of channels of love that I don't know how to get at in another way.

That sounds like a really powerful connection that you're trying to get, there.

Nero: I still have a certain amount of faith in the notion that words tied to melodies ... that there's kind of a collective consciousness in humans, that we connect through song in a way that is not afforded to us in other avenues.

YouTube

Allison Russell: Yeah, I think there's just a really visceral, deep, emotional connection that can happen with music. My grandmother had Alzheimer's, and eventually died of it. But I remember, shortly before her death in 2006  language was gone, she didn't know who we were, but if I sang her songs that she had sung to me as a child, songs that were from her childhood as well, she could sing with me. That really struck me. You know, I'm not by any means an expert on the neuroscience of music, but it taps into literally a different part of our brains and psyches. I was so struck by that with my grandma, and that was one way that we could still connect. Everything was fear and confusion for her at that point, but when we sang together she sort of came back to us.

Is that where the song ""Barley"" came from?

Russell: Definitely, that song is inspired by her and that experience. She had a wealth of traditional British Isles tunes and songs that came out of the oral tradition. ""Barely"" is definitely influenced by the things that she taught me, the songs. And she was quite an amazing lady.

Let's shift gears just a little bit and bring this back down to a real carnal level with the song ""Estrella Goodbye."" JT, when you're writing this song  if you're getting all spiritual and highfalutin in other songs, this must be just pure release, right? Just to write something sexy and fun.

Nero: Well it's the same deal, it's just a different take on it. You know, time is the enemy. I have sort of a genre in my head, what I think of as ""apocalyptic party jams"": where you're somewhat aware of time, darkness, shadows encroaching, but that just makes you really dig in on the good times. Exhibit A is Sam Cooke, ""Good Times."" You know, ""It might be one o'clock, it might be three / Time don't mean that much to me / I've felt this good since I don't know when / and I might not feel this good again."" You know, like that.

The two of you spend a huge amount of time touring on the road, and I wonder if there are times where you wish you had more separation between your musical life and your home life.

Nero: I think being on the road has become our natural state.

Russell: Our daughter is 2 now, and she's been on the road her whole life, so it's her normal and natural rhythm as well. But as she gets older and closer to school age  for me, I would love to knock it back to maybe seven months of the year.

What do you think you are going to do when she does go to school?

Russell: We may delay when she begins school, we might wait until she's 

Nero: Seventeen. [Laughs]

Russell: No, not that long! But we may home-school until she's about 6 or 7. I mean, we're not settled on this yet  we'll have to play it by ear and see how she feels. But we're very, very lucky: JT's mom and dad are very hands-on, loving grandparents, so there may be times where we go out and she stays, or comes to join us on a weekend. We're going to be sort of playing that by ear and figuring it out as we go.",[]

This week, we bring you three items.

From digital editor Joe Ruiz:

Growing up a basketball fan in South Texas in the 90s, I followed the San Antonio Spurs, devoured SLAM magazine and watched ESPN for hours. The last two introduced me to Allen Iverson and made me one of his biggest fans.

Here was this superstar athlete, barely six feet tall, who could score at will, break the ankles of any defender and poured his heart into the game night after night.

He was one of those players you wish you could be on the blacktop, screaming ""Iverson!"" as you shot a fadeaway jumper. And here was this player who not only changed the way people think of the game, but unwillingly ushered in the fashion of today's NBA players.

""I just felt the NBA was just picking on me. That's all. Other guys in the league at the time dressed like me. Guys is supposed to be able to be original and dress like how they want to dress. The NBA can't dress no grown man.""

This interview by Complex is wide-ranging, insightful, funny and worth your time, especially if you're a basketball fan.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go practice my crossover in my Reebok Questions.

From NPR Investigations Editor Alicia Cypress:

It's easy to just think of a glass of Chianti as a fruity and rustic sipper that tastes good with pizza or a hearty Italian meal. But this week, The New York Times gives us a glimpse at some environmental factors threatening that glass.

The ecosystem of the popular Tuscan wine region is under attack!

""And the enemy? An exploding population of voracious wild boars and deer that savor the sugary grapes and the vines' tender sprouts, but that are also part of the region's famed landscape, hunting traditions and cuisine.""

As the story continues:

""The toll is estimated at $11 million to $16 million a year in lost harvest. There are also the costs of erecting and keeping up fences, which have proved controversial because of criticism that they mar the beauty of the Tuscan countryside.""

This is the tale of how a community struggles to balance its beauty and traditions with an important economic source that's woven into its history, land and culture. It's also a fun reminder that the glass of wine you drink has its own story to tell.

From Executive Producer for Editorial Franchises Tracy Wahl:

For this piece, The Boston Globe reached out to Stanford sociologists to isolate income data for Boston and Eastern Massachusetts in order to show how neighborhoods in the Boston area are increasingly economically segregated. It's a great example of how journalists can join forces with academics, combining vivid descriptions with rigorous research to tell a compelling story.

The article says, ""In the poorest tracts, family income is less than two-thirds of the median for the whole region. In the wealthiest, it's more than 150 percent of the median. The range for middle-class neighborhoods is 80 to 125 percent.""

The article also notes that this is true for other big cities around the country. Many of us who live in major metropolitan areas like Washington D.C. sense this disparity, but the expressive writing, supported by solid data, really brought the story home. The imagery in this paragraph is a great example:",[]

Women sportscasters are heartened by the jury verdict this week that awarded their colleague Erin Andrews $55 million.

Andrews was secretly videotaped while naked by a stalker through the peephole in her hotel room door. Both the stalker and the hotel owner were found liable.

The case highlights the security risks that are especially pronounced for female journalists covering sports, who, working in a male-dominated field surrounded by passionate male fans, often travel alone.

Among them is Laura Okmin, a sideline reporter covering the NFL on Fox Sports. In an interview with Melissa Block, Okmin talks about the precautions she's taken to protect herself on the road, and whether she feels Andrews' verdict will change the approach to security in the profession.

Okmin says an overall awareness is necessary for all women to have, not just for those working in sports journalism. When taking safety measures into consideration, she says, ""Now, I think more than ever, I just feel that I'd rather sound a little crazy and sound a little paranoid and still feel safe.""

Interview Highlights

On the safety precautions she takes when traveling to games. (SportsNet New York's Kerith Burke said she travels with Band-Aids to put over hotel door peepholes.)

I think it's just being very aware when you're on the road. And it can be as simple as when I travel if I'm checking in when I go to the front desk, I don't say my last name. I'll say it very quietly if there are people around. And I ask them as they're handing me something, not to say my name and also not to say the room number, more importantly. I'm very aware of that. If there's people standing around, and again, this isn't just for women on air or women who are known publicly, this is just for women, period. If there's a lot of people standing there, and the room is said out loud, I think that's something nowadays that we're a little bit more aware of. When I walk into an elevator, I never open the envelope that holds the card ... when I'm charging something, I never say my room number. ...

One time I was in the elevator, someone walked in, real close before it was shutting, and kind of jumped in with me and didn't press a button and said, ""Hello, Laura Okmin."" And it could be as simple as just someone who happened to recognize me and happened to be going to the same floor, but I think my antenna was raised enough to just stand there and then I walked out, he walked out, I walked back in and went downstairs to the lobby and I switched my room.

On whether she's at risk, being a woman covering sports in a male-dominated field

I don't know if I would say ""at risk."" I would say where I do feel that, though, and I've talked to enough of my female peers to know we all feel this ... when you're on a court, when you're on a field  for me now, a football field  it amazes me the things men will yell at you and will say to you. I tend to never, unless it's somebody who's yelling for me, says something that I know they know me, I won't look into a crowd. I used to just have one IFB, the earpiece in one ear so I could hear the telecast going on. I now get two. Part of that's 'cause it's loud at a stadium and I want to hear better, but also a big part of it is to tune that out. And it gets ugly, and I would say lately, more than 15 years ago, the ugliness and the venom that I hear is a lot more vulgar and is a lot scarier than it used to be. But I also do think that there's part of that attached to the social media and the anonymity people now feel kind of blanketed from.

So I don't feel that with my safety, my physical safety when I travel. But I feel that on the field just feeling that in terms of sports fans. And you know, it's a bunch of drinking, depending on how your team's feeling you might be feeling real good about yourself or really bad about yourself ... And I always think, and I've said it before, ""Boy, how would you feel if this was your mother, sister, daughter, girlfriend, wife, and you knew that men were yelling that kind of thing at her,"" and usually that shuts them up kind of quickly.

On whether the Erin Andrews lawsuit changes things in terms of women traveling and security

I hope so. And I really hope so in terms of women being more aware. I have a company that I do boot camps and workshops for young women who are going into sports and this will be a big topic at the next boot camp ... I think so many of us going into sports, you want to prove that you're one of the guys. And I think that's the younger me talking, but I know that any time, when I'm younger and I didn't feel safe and I did have a stalk situation very early on in my career  I was almost embarrassed by it because I didn't want anyone to treat me differently, I didn't want to look like I needed extra care, extra hand-holding. So I probably dismissed that and I'm very fortunate, especially with the stalking situation, I had a boss who did not, who took it very seriously.

But I think what this does is, absolutely makes any woman who, again travel, period  not just through sports, but just travel  think about their awareness, think about is there any way they're vulnerable and what can they do, what extra steps can they take to make sure that they feel safe and even more importantly again, not to be embarrassed or not to dismiss something by going, ""I don't want to look paranoid. I don't want to look high maintenance."" I just think that feeling safe and feeling secure and being able to sleep at night is much, much more important.

On whether the level of vitriol she's exposed to makes her love her job less

... I've come to accept that that's part of it and I hate that answer, as I'm thinking, how do I help the next generation of young women growing? And I hate to think that I would say to them, ""Hey it's part of the job, just accept it."" Because we shouldn't. We absolutely shouldn't. there's absolutely no context in any part of our world that it's OK for a woman to be doing her job and sit here and hear those kind of ugly things being thrown at them, so it hasn't made me love my job any less, but I guess it's just made me a little bit sadder in terms of how comfortable people are or how accepting those people are in saying those kinds of things. And also I think about, too, the people that are sitting around them, to think that it's OK or it's funny to be standing and yelling at a woman doing her job  you know, stinks. So no, it hasn't made me love my job any less, it's just made me a little bit sadder it terms of what women have to deal with these days. We're just trying to do our jobs.",[]

Horses with manes and tails aflame stampede through the streets of Blitz-era London. Luftwaffe bombers attack, ""great clusters of them, like midges over a stagnant pond."" These are among the myriad indelible images that haunt Noonday, Pat Barker's powerful, ambitious historical novel. Depicting the lives of a group of young men and women struggling to survive during the weeks that German bombs lacerated the United Kingdom, the book completes the trilogy Barker embarked upon with Life Class and Toby's Room. Those novels returned to the WWI period setting of Barker's acclaimed Regeneration Trilogy, so Noonday represents her first fictional foray into World War II. The results are stirring.

Although this novel may be read as a stand-alone, fans of Life Class and Toby's Room will enjoy being reunited with Elinor Brooke, a painter whose talent has landed three of her canvases at the Tate. This being wartime, Elinor has put away her brushes to drive an ambulance at the Tottenham Court Road depot. Increasingly estranged from her husband Paul, also an artist, she harbors a long-simmering attraction to old art-school flame Kit Neville. The novel plumbs the intricacies of their relationship over the course of late summer and early fall 1940, as the 500-pounders pummel London from above.

Some of their passions have the cheap feel of a soap opera. When Elinor sits down for one of her regular heart to hearts with Paul or Kit you can almost see the bubbles rise in the room. Much of the story was too weepy for me; I would have found a drier approach to its people more believable, and more enjoyable. But the dominant character here is the Blitz itself, and in its portrayal Barker delivers her most affecting storytelling.

It's no mean feat to match the horror of a historical experience with horrific language and not go over the top into fright-show territory. Often enough, Pat Barker walks this line with sensory-thick language; its sweep makes us truly appreciate life and death in a decimated landscape.

War images are searing (literally, as fires burn everywhere, day and night), as well as up close and personal. ""The change was in the sky: beyond the black ridges of the rooftops, a red, sullen glare was growing and spreading, lit at intervals by the orange flashes of exploding bombs."" We smell the foul interiors of overnight shelters. We hear the crunch of glass underfoot as the shell-shocked denizens emerge from behind blackout curtains to kill the horror with glasses of sweet, numbing whisky. And we see oily smoke drifting over black roads, and bodies lying in the gutters ""like sodden heaps of rags.""

Noonday gives us bravery among the ruins: Elinor must leave her house when it is crushed by a bomb. The face of Kit Neville, who longs for their former passion, was ravaged in the last war and has been sewn together in a patchwork of pain. The women of the ambulance corps plaster themselves with cosmetics to offset the gray dust on their faces, the under-eye circles of exhaustion. Some of these scenes are as casual as they are unforgettable: A man's head rests upon a concrete sidewalk, ""severed neatly at the neck, one eye closed."" A child simply kicks it aside.

Effortlessly delivering beautiful toss-off sentences, Barker effectively captures the time and place: ""Even the roses, this summer, looked as if they were expecting to be bombed."" Her evocative language applies to more intimate personal matters, too  as her mother's heart beats its last, Elinor ""could almost believe she saw the dark, struggling muscle laboring away inside its cage of bone.""

Some of the language becomes bruise-purple; readers might not want to hear quite so much sentiment along the lines of ""Nightmares crawled across each other like copulating toads."" It's no mean feat to match the horror of a historical experience with horrific language and not go over the top into fright-show territory. Often enough, Pat Barker walks this line with sensory-thick language; its sweep makes us truly appreciate life and death in a decimated landscape: ""London: no longer one of the world's great centers of civilization, but merely a settlement on a river, lit by guttering candles after dark.""

Puerto Rico is losing people. Due to a decade-long recession, more than 50,000 residents leave the U.S. territory each yearmost for jobs and new lives on the mainland. This issue is especially affecting healthcare, where it's estimated that at least one doctor leaves Puerto Rico every day.

The mass exodus of doctors is creating vacancies that are hard to fill and waiting lists for patient care. Dr. Antonio Peraza is among those doctors who recently left for the mainland. He specializes in internal medicine and for nearly 14 years, had a private practice in Bayamon, Puerto Rico.

His was a wrenching decision to close his practice and take a job offer in Miami, Florida.

""I wish you could have seen my patients. My patients, the day I told them I was going to close my office, they cried,"" Dr. Antonio Peraza says. ""I felt like I was betraying them.""

For decades, long before Obamacare, Puerto Rico has had a government-run healthcare system that provides coverage for nearly everyone on the island. It offers generous benefits, but has never been adequately funded.

Nearly two-thirds of the island's residents are covered by Medicaid or Medicare. But both of those programs cap payments to Puerto Rico at levels far below what the states receive.

And in the last few years, Peraza says Medicare paymentsalready lowhave been cut further.

""What they have been doing unfortunately is taking these Medicare cuts and passing them along to providers and the patients. Which, we are the weakest link of the chain,"" Dr. Peraza says.

Faced with a declining income, Peraza decided to move to Florida and sell his office building and practice in Bayamon. But so far he says, he hasn't found a doctor interested in buying him out.

""Because most of them are in the same plan as I am doing. Maybe they are a little behind. Plan B is you have to leave the island because there's no other way, there's no choice,"" he says.

Congress is working on a plan to help Puerto Rico fix its economic problems and avoid defaulting on its more than $72 billion debt. Puerto Rican officials are hoping the plan will also include an increase in Medicare and Medicaid funding.

Meantime, the exodus of doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals is making it hard for hospitals and clinics on the island to fill vacant positions. Puerto Rico already had a shortage of specialists.

Domingo Cruz Vivaldi is vice-president of San Jorge Children's Hospital in San Juan and he says, with so many doctors leaving, it's getting worse.

""To see an adult rheumatologist right now, today, the waiting period it can be four to five months. And some of them are moving out. And then to replace those physicians, it takes a decade,"" Cruz Vivaldi says.

The outlook is no better for young doctors just starting their careers. At the University of Puerto Rico, one of four medical schools on the island, Manuel Rodriguez is doing a residency in orthopedic surgery. He says of his friends, only about one in five plan on staying in Puerto Rico to practice.

""I would love to stay here,"" Rodriguez says. ""But seeing the reality we live every day here with the resources that the hospital has, with the resources that the government has. It's difficult to think that we're going to stay here in Puerto Rico.""

After his residency, Rodriguez says he'll look for a fellowship on the mainland. Fourth year medical student Milagros Lopez says opportunities and pay are better there, but Puerto Rico is home.

""There's a huge economic incentive to stay away, which is a sad, sad truth. But the thing is, we are a different group of people,"" Lopez says. ""This has our home, our family, our language. So, I think there is an attachment that's kind of unavoidable there.""

Lopez says she hopes to come back to Puerto Rico after completing a fellowship on the mainland, but knows life might intervene. Her brother left for a surgical fellowship in the states five years ago, she says. Today, he's married, has two kids and lives in Detroit.",[]

Writer Tracy Chevalier spins fiction from history. Her best-selling novel Girl with a Pearl Earring was set in the 17th-century studio of Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer; 2010's Remarkable Creatures focused on 19th-century English fossil hunters; and 2005's The Lady and the Unicorn told the stories of medieval tapestry weavers. Now, Chevalier's latest book looks at a pioneer family trying to scrape out a life in the swamps of Ohio.

It's called At the Edge of the Orchard, and it follows the lives of James and Sadie Goodenough, two characters who are at each other's throats for much of the book. Sadie is a violent, abusive drunk; and James is obsessed with growing sweet apples, as opposed to the sour, cider-making varieties that would enable Sadie's drinking. The couple has 10 children, but many of them are picked off by swamp fever.

Chevalier is known for the research she puts into her novels. She took a painting class when she was writing Girl with a Pearl Earring, and went fossil hunting for Remarkable Creatures. But she tells NPR's Melissa Block that writing At the Edge of the Orchard called for a different kind of research: ""I ate a lot of apples.""

Interview Highlights

On what drew her to a story about a pioneer family

It started with Johnny Appleseed, actually. And I hadn't realized that Johnny Appleseed lived a very different life from what the storybooks told us as kids. You know, we always grew up ... thinking that he handed out apple seeds far and wide in Ohio and Indiana, and promoted healthy eating and healthy living. And actually, Johnny Appleseed anticipated the arrival of settlers in Ohio. He would go to the places he thought people would settle in a few years' time, plant a nursery of apple trees and then sell them to settlers when they came. He was a business man. He was making money.

I had this vision of a couple, a pioneer couple, arguing over apples  one of them wanting sweet apples to eat, the other wanting to grow sour apples so that there'd be enough cider to go around ...

And the other thing is that he sold apple trees that produced apples that were made into cider and applejack, not sweet apples for eating. And when I read about this ... I had this vision of a couple, a pioneer couple, arguing over apples  one of them wanting sweet apples to eat, the other wanting to grow sour apples so that there'd be enough cider to go around to obliterate the difficult lives they were leading.

On Sadie Goodenough, a character who is hard to like

There are times when I'm hoping the reader will feel slightly sympathetic. She's in a marriage she should never have made and she's kind of stuck in this swamp. And she is, yes, self-centered and a terrible mother; but she also is misunderstood, I think, at times, and frustrated. ...

And Johnny Appleseed is a little bit like her drug dealer because he comes along twice a year in his canoe to see how they're doing and he sometimes takes off the barrels of apples and brings them back pressed for them as cider. ... I don't think he does it maliciously but he is, as I said  he is a businessman, so he's got a slightly different take on it all.

On what Johnny Appleseed was really like

Actually, some of the myth is true. He did sometimes wear a tin pot for a hat. His clothing was interesting, shall we say. He often wore a coffee sack that he cut holes out of, and a rope for a belt. So yeah, he was a strange guy.

He was actually making all this money not for himself, but really because he was what they called a Swedenborgian, a very peculiar Christian sect. And Johnny Appleseed spent a lot of time proselytizing for Swedenborgians, so he would come and visit a family like the Goodenoughs and would say, ""Let me bring you news fresh from heaven."" And he'd go on in this kind of rant and a lot of the settlers  I read some hilarious accounts of them going: This guy, we don't understand a word he's saying, but you know he's kind of entertaining, so he's harmless.

On her favorite apple from the book.

But my favorite apple that's in the book, that's mentioned in the book, is called the Pitmaston Pineapple and it tastes of nuts and honey, but it also has a kind of pineapple finish  faint taste of pineapple at the end. But I loved them so much that I have planted my own Pitmaston Pineapple tree and in a couple years I'm really hoping it bears fruit.",[]

Two valuable Indian sandstone sculptures dating back to the eighth century were seized by federal agents just days before they were scheduled to be sold at Christie's, a New York auction house.

NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports that together, the statues are valued at almost a half-million dollars.

""One dates back to eighth-century India and is a rare depiction of a Hindu god and his entourage on horseback. ""The other  believed to be made in the tenth century  shows a Hindu teacher flanked by two attendants. ""Together, they're valued at almost a half-million dollars.""

Agents of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations say the statues were recovered as part of an ongoing initiative called Operation Hidden Idol, which focuses on ""activities surrounding the illicit cultural property trade in New York."" Both stolen items came from a smuggler of looted antiquities. According to court documents, investigators found an unlabeled computer disc in a Manhattan storage facility in 2012, with a folder labeled ""Shantoo"" that contained images of stolen antiquities and names of dealers.

A person was charged in connection with the disc, and after pleading guilty to criminal possession of stolen property and related charges, that person became an informant for the investigation. An affidavit by a federal agent says the informant said ""Shantoo"" was a nickname for Ranjeet Kanwat, a ""known smuggler"" from India, and one of the main suppliers of stolen artifacts for Subhash Kapoor, who is currently awaiting extradition to New York in connection with more than $100 million in stolen antiquities.

Ambassador Riva Ganguly Das, consul general of India, praised the recovery of the ancient statues.

""My congratulations to all of the special agents of HSI New York, who have painstakingly and diligently undertaken these complex and time consuming investigations,"" he said.

Christie's auction house said it had no knowledge that the statues were stolen.

""Christie's devotes considerable resources to investigating the provenance of all objects we offer for sale. Under no circumstance would Christie's knowingly offer a work of art where there are valid concerns over provenance,"" the auction house said in a statement. ""This is one of the difficulties the art market faces in vetting antiquities, which is why Christie's very much values building strong relationships with and between countries of origin, law enforcement, archaeologists, and the collecting community.""

Christie's had been planning to auction the statues during Asia Week New York. Now it has removed them from the list of items for sale and is cooperating with investigators.

An ICE spokesperson said the antiquities ""will be repatriated to the government of India"" though no date has been set for their return.

According to an ICE press release, more than 8,000 artifacts have been returned to 30 countries since 2007. These items include paintings from France, Germany, Poland and Austria; 15th to 18th century manuscripts from Italy and Peru; as well as cultural artifacts from China, Cambodia and Iraq.",[]
npr.org,2016-03-12 00:00:00,Republican Candidates On Keeping Or Changing Social Security,[],"FACT CHECK: Republican Candidates On Keeping Or Changing Social Security

i toggle caption Wilfredo Lee/AP Wilfredo Lee/AP

This story is part of NPR's fact-checking series, Break it Down.

Florida, which holds its presidential primary on Tuesday, is home to more than 3 million seniors who rely on Social Security. At the GOP debate in Miami Thursday night, candidates were asked about their plans for the program.

All the Republican candidates say they want to leave Social Security as it is for people who are already retired, or soon will be. But Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have proposed changes for younger workers. Donald Trump says he wants to preserve Social Security benefits and is counting on stronger economic growth to help pay for that.

The Claims:

Dana Bash, CNN: ""According to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years."" Marco Rubio: ""Anyone who tells you Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, 'We don't have to do anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,' they're not being honest with you. Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents. For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68....If I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow a fast as someone who made less money."" Ted Cruz: ""Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it's irresponsible.....For younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dana, we need to have for younger workers that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts like the 401(k) that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids."" John Kasich: ""If you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you'll still get it. It will simply be less. And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they'll get their full benefit."" Donald Trump: ""I will do everything in my power not to touch Social Security....I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it.""

The Big Questions:

1. How big is the hole in the Social Security safety net?

2. What would it take to fix it?

The Short Answers:

1. The question from CNN somewhat overstates the problem. Social Security won't ""run out of money"" in 20 years. What will happen  somewhere around 2035  is the program will exhaust its ""Trust Fund,"" which Social Security uses to help supplement money from payroll taxes. Even after the trust fund is gone, payroll taxes paid by workers will continue to flow into the system, and those funds will be sufficient to cover about three-quarters of all retirement benefits. In other words, if nothing is done, future retirees could still expect to collect 75 cents for every dollar of Social Security they're owed. (Social Security has a separate program that pays disability benefits, and it faces a more urgent cash crunch. If money from the retirement program is diverted to back fill the disability program, the trust fund will be exhausted a few years earlier.)

2. There are a number of ways to close the gap between the money Social Security expects to take in from payroll taxes (the sole source of revenue once the trust fund is exhausted) and what it's expected to pay out in retirement benefits. All of the fixes involve some combination of raising revenue and/or cutting benefits. If policy makers act now, the gap could be closed with relatively modest changes. The longer we wait, the larger the required changes will have to be. Some of the fixes proposed by the GOP candidates would help to narrow the gap, but none would close it altogether.

The Long Answers:

The basic challenge facing Social Security is demographic. The system relies on payroll taxes from people who are working to pay benefits to those who are retired. That worked well when there were four or five workers for every retiree. But that ratio has now dropped below three workers per retiree and it's drifting towards two. Absent another baby boom or a massive influx of immigrants, that's not likely to change.

If policy makers take no action, there will still be money coming in to Social Security from payroll taxes. It just won't be enough to cover all the benefits that retirees will be owed. (It will be enough to pay about 75 cents on the dollar.)

Closing that gap will require cutting benefits, raising taxes, or some combination of the two.

Rubio's proposal: Marco Rubio suggests gradually raising the retirement age at which younger workers like himself become eligible for Social Security. This is effectively a cut in benefits, since retirees would have fewer years to collect. Raising the top retirement age from 67 to 70 as Rubio proposed would fill about one-third of the Social Security shortfall. Rubio also suggested a form of ""means testing,"" in which wealthier retirees would see smaller benefit increases in the future. The Senator didn't offer any details, but other means testing proposals have been estimated to reduce the funding shortfall by about 10 percent.

Cruz's proposal: Ted Cruz suggests a different form of benefit cut, in which future retirees would receive smaller cost-of-living adjustments. Some argue that the current inflation measure used by Social Security overstates the price increases seniors face, although others insist cost of living adjustments should be bigger, not smaller. The cut that Cruz suggests would fix about 15 percent of the funding shortfall. Cruz also proposes letting workers divert a portion of their payroll taxes into private retirement accounts. This may or may not be a good idea. It was hotly debated during the George W. Bush administration. But using payroll taxes for any purpose other than Social Security would make the system's solvency problems worse, not better.

Kasich's proposal: John Kasich also advocates means testing with reduced benefits for wealthy seniors.

Trump's proposal: Donald Trump argues against any cut in benefits or increase in taxes, instead relying on faster economic growth to close the Social Security funding gap. Kathleen Romig of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities says faster growth would help with this and many other challenges. But she warns it's not a ""magic bullet."" Forecasters have tried to predict Social Security's fate under many different economic scenarios, and there's no realistic growth level that would close the funding gap on its own. Faster growth cuts both ways, increasing revenue from payroll taxes but also increasing benefits, which are tied to wages.

Revenue proposals: None of the Republicans suggested raising payroll taxes, but that's another way policymakers could help to close the funding gap. Payroll taxes for Social Security are currently 12.4 percent, split between employers and employees. Raising that rate to about 15 percent would close the funding gap entirely. (There's a separate, 2.9 percent payroll tax for Medicare.) Alternatively, policymakers could apply the payroll tax to more income. Wages and salaries above $117,000 a year are currently exempt from Social Security taxes. If that cap were eliminated, it would solve about 90 percent of the funding gap.

Any of these fixes can be thought of as items on a menu, to be mixed, matched, and combined in whatever way is most politically palatable. By acting now, policymakers could solve the Social Security gap with a relatively modest increase in taxes and modest adjustments to benefits. With each passing year of inaction, though, the gap to be filled gets larger.",[]

On Sunday morning, Americans will ""spring forward."" With the exception of Hawaii and some parts of Arizona, people will set their clocks ahead to get more light at night.

Not everybody's on board. Sure, Australia and most of Europe join us but most African and Asian nations skip daylight saving time. India and China don't enforce it, for example.

But it doesn't mean they haven't tried. Since the concept of daylight saving time was first embraced by Germany during World War I, many parts of the world have flirted with DST, mostly in the hope it could cut down on electricity usage.

""Somehow, people [around the world] bought into the notion that if we squeeze our clocks enough, we could save oil,"" says Michael Downing, author of Spring Forward: The Annual Madness of Daylight Saving Time. ""Unlike any other energy policy, it costs the consumers nothing, so legislators love it.""

It's hard to prove it. In a given year it could look like DST is saving people money, he says. ""But really, it could be due to something like a mild spring.""

Sometimes, DST is practiced in places where it doesn't make sense, like countries near the equator, says Downing. ""The amount of sunlight is pretty steady,"" he says. ""But they wanted to line up with American time zones and keep themselves in sync.""

Here's a few examples of how different places have played around with daylight saving time:

Bangladesh

Struggling with frequent blackouts, in 2009 the country observed DST on a trial basis to see if it would help save energy. In just six months it was canceled. The government said DST did help reduce peak electricity demand, but not everyone was a fan. People were confused by the switch, and sleepy schoolchildren were mad about having to wake up in the dark. Bangladesh hasn't tried it again since then.

Egypt

The Brits introduced daylight saving time during World War II, and since then different leaders have loved it or left it. In 2014, DST was reintroduced to help curb energy consumption  but was discontinued the next year. Citizens were unhappy about changing the clocks four times during the year  Egypt paused DST during Ramadan to end the fast an hour earlier. And studies showed no effect on energy consumption.

Namibia

Namibia is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa to use daylight saving time, which they've had since 1994. But it could soon go away. Citizens complain that when the clocks are set back, it gets dark too early when people come home from work. So last year, the government launched public consultations to look into nixing it for good.

South Africa

In 2014, a group of researchers at the municipal energy office in Durban, South Africa, put together a report to test the idea of DST. In addition to potentially reducing the town's annual electricity consumption between .2 and .5 percent, the researchers hoped to enhance the ""lifestyle benefits for Durban residents and tourism""  the latest sunset in Durban is 7 p.m. But South Africa still has not joined the DST bandwagon.

One More Weird Thing...

Some places play with time for their own reasons. A resort in Madagascar called Anjajavy wanted the sun to rise later and set earlier, so they created their own time zone  an hour ahead of the rest of Madagascar  for a later sunset hour. Visitors have to change their watches to Anjajavy time. Says the hotel's website: ""A time peculiar to Anjajavy the lodge was created so that we are better adjusted to the natural cycles of the reserve and the village. Therefore, at 5 pm lemurs naturally join us in the Oasis garden to take advantage the foliage. It is fresh hour, right in time for the ""5 O'clock tea.""",[]

i toggle caption Melissa Block/NPR Melissa Block/NPR

The epidemic of opioid abuse that's swept the U.S. has left virtually no community unscathed, from big cities to tiny towns.

In fact, drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury death in this country: more than gun deaths; more than car crashes.

There were more than 47,000 drug overdose deaths in the U.S. in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That includes unintentional overdoses and suicides. More than half of those were from opioids, including painkillers and heroin.

I went to rural Berks County in southeast Pennsylvania to hear what the opioid epidemic means in a small town, a place where everyone knows everyone and the ripples of addiction spread wide.

Really, I could have gone just about anywhere. No community is immune.

The landscape in Berks County is bucolic: rolling farmland studded with silos and 19th-century stone barns. But that peaceful landscape belies a serious problem. Opioid addiction is deeply embedded in these small towns.

""It's become a crisis,"" says Phil Salamone, a paramedia in Kutztown, Pa.

He points out that heroin is both cheap and readily available from nearby cities such as Reading and Philadelphia. Salamone says, ""There is no exclusive demographic that's using it. It's everybody. It's kids, adults, low income, high income. It's everywhere.""

i toggle caption Melissa Block/NPR Melissa Block/NPR

Local paramedics have been able to save lives by using the drug naloxone, also known as Narcan. It reverses an overdose by latching onto receptors in the brain and kicking the opiates off.

""We don't ever have to worry about that medication expiring because it's always used, Salamone says, somewhat ruefully.

The Kutztown ambulance squad has ""Narcanned"" ten overdose victims so far this year. Salamone says the drug makes paramedics like him look really good. ""You have a patient that is unresponsive. We start an IV on them, administer naloxone and they wake up! Just like nothing had happened.""

Early one morning last May, a neighboring ambulance squad got an emergency call from Brandywine Heights High School. A girl had been nodding off at her desk. She soon collapsed, semiconscious and turning gray. She had overdosed on heroin.

School guidance counselor David Favata, a certified EMS worker, raced in and got the girl breathing with a bag mask. An ambulance whisked her to the hospital and she did survive, but it was a close call.

It turned out she had done heroin in the school bathroom before class that morning.

School principal Josh Ziatyk recalls her as a great kid, a former cheerleader, with ""tons of energy and the world ahead of her."" But, he says, ""Through the late middle school years into early high school years, there was a change that occurred within her. And little by little, [she] just found herself into a black hole, into a rut, and couldn't get out of it.""

The opioid epidemic has galvanized Brandywine Heights and neighboring Kutztown Area High School into action. Between them, they lost six former students to heroin overdose within two years.

i toggle caption Melissa Block/NPR Melissa Block/NPR

Nurses at the middle and high schools now stock naloxone in the event of an overdose.

Both communities have organized groups to spread awareness about opioid abuse and try to prevent it. They sponsor activities to keep young people engaged. Boredom is a problem in a small town, and drugs can easily fill that void.

At Kutztown High, students meet each week as part of a group called Kutztown Strong, which was formed in response to the drug crisis. When I visit, they're busy planning a three-on-three basketball tournament.

After the meeting, freshman Ramsi Ross tells me how angry she gets when she reads social media posts about the overdose deaths of young people. ""Everyone's saying like 'rest in peace, you'll be missed,' and I just couldn't help but think, these were your friends! Couldn't you have done something? Maybe you should have got involved in Kutztown Strong and stopped your friends from using.""

Of 450 students at Kutztown High, there are about five who are back in school after rehab. And there are quite a few others the staff is concerned about.

Teachers and counselors meet each week with a specialist who has a contract to work in the school. This student assistance team is part of a state-mandated program in Pennsylvania.

They're on the lookout for kids in trouble. It could be eating disorders, anxiety, self-harm, or drug and alcohol abuse. They look for possible warning signs: kids whose grades have tanked or who've changed friend groups.

On the state level, it's hard to get solid data on whether these interventions are effective. But the staff members at Kutztown High say they're providing a crucial support network for kids at risk.

Guidance counselor Andrew Brett has seen a recent pattern: kids who start with pot may pivot to prescription painkillers and sometimes  across the spectrum, from the highest achievers on down  to heroin.

""Kids aren't afraid of it,"" he tells me. ""Years ago, it was,'Well, heroin is for junkies.' And you had to be pretty low, and that was the perception. Well, that's not the perception. It's available and it's cheap. And it's readily available in our community.""

When the student assistance team wants to intervene, they approach the student's parents first.

School superintendent Kathy Metrick says that conversation doesn't always go so well: ""I sat across the table from a parent whose child had been found in possession of all sorts of paraphernalia, and she said he was picking up trash off the street, that he would never do that.""

Metrick goes on, ""The denial is just so powerful. And you want to say, 'Please save your child!' Because, if we're wrong, yay! That would be the best news ever. But gosh, if we're right and we have a chance to step in now before it's too late, let's do that.""

But Metrick knows even if they do step in, that's no guarantee.

Students will likely come back from rehab to the same circle of friends, the same triggers and temptations as before.",[]

Writer Tracy Chevalier spins fiction from history. Her best-selling novel Girl with a Pearl Earring was set in the 17th-century studio of Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer; 2010's Remarkable Creatures focused on 19th-century English fossil hunters; and 2005's The Lady and the Unicorn told the stories of medieval tapestry weavers. Now, Chevalier's latest book looks at a pioneer family trying to scrape out a life in the swamps of Ohio.

It's called At the Edge of the Orchard, and it follows the lives of James and Sadie Goodenough, two characters who are at each other's throats for much of the book. Sadie is a violent, abusive drunk; and James is obsessed with growing sweet apples, as opposed to the sour, cider-making varieties that would enable Sadie's drinking. The couple has 10 children, but many of them are picked off by swamp fever.

Chevalier is known for the research she puts into her novels. She took a painting class when she was writing Girl with a Pearl Earring, and went fossil hunting for Remarkable Creatures. But she tells NPR's Melissa Block that writing At the Edge of the Orchard called for a different kind of research: ""I ate a lot of apples.""

Interview Highlights

On what drew her to a story about a pioneer family

It started with Johnny Appleseed, actually. And I hadn't realized that Johnny Appleseed lived a very different life from what the storybooks told us as kids. You know, we always grew up ... thinking that he handed out apple seeds far and wide in Ohio and Indiana, and promoted healthy eating and healthy living. And actually, Johnny Appleseed anticipated the arrival of settlers in Ohio. He would go to the places he thought people would settle in a few years' time, plant a nursery of apple trees and then sell them to settlers when they came. He was a business man. He was making money.

I had this vision of a couple, a pioneer couple, arguing over apples  one of them wanting sweet apples to eat, the other wanting to grow sour apples so that there'd be enough cider to go around ...

And the other thing is that he sold apple trees that produced apples that were made into cider and applejack, not sweet apples for eating. And when I read about this ... I had this vision of a couple, a pioneer couple, arguing over apples  one of them wanting sweet apples to eat, the other wanting to grow sour apples so that there'd be enough cider to go around to obliterate the difficult lives they were leading.

On Sadie Goodenough, a character who is hard to like

There are times when I'm hoping the reader will feel slightly sympathetic. She's in a marriage she should never have made and she's kind of stuck in this swamp. And she is, yes, self-centered and a terrible mother; but she also is misunderstood, I think, at times, and frustrated. ...

And Johnny Appleseed is a little bit like her drug dealer because he comes along twice a year in his canoe to see how they're doing and he sometimes takes off the barrels of apples and brings them back pressed for them as cider. ... I don't think he does it maliciously but he is, as I said  he is a businessman, so he's got a slightly different take on it all.

On what Johnny Appleseed was really like

Actually, some of the myth is true. He did sometimes wear a tin pot for a hat. His clothing was interesting, shall we say. He often wore a coffee sack that he cut holes out of, and a rope for a belt. So yeah, he was a strange guy.

He was actually making all this money not for himself, but really because he was what they called a Swedenborgian, a very peculiar Christian sect. And Johnny Appleseed spent a lot of time proselytizing for Swedenborgians, so he would come and visit a family like the Goodenoughs and would say, ""Let me bring you news fresh from heaven."" And he'd go on in this kind of rant and a lot of the settlers  I read some hilarious accounts of them going: This guy, we don't understand a word he's saying, but you know he's kind of entertaining, so he's harmless.

On her favorite apple from the book.

But my favorite apple that's in the book, that's mentioned in the book, is called the Pitmaston Pineapple and it tastes of nuts and honey, but it also has a kind of pineapple finish  faint taste of pineapple at the end. But I loved them so much that I have planted my own Pitmaston Pineapple tree and in a couple years I'm really hoping it bears fruit.",[]

Two valuable Indian sandstone sculptures dating back to the eighth century were seized by federal agents just days before they were scheduled to be sold at Christie's, a New York auction house.

NPR's Hansi Lo Wang reports that together, the statues are valued at almost a half-million dollars.

""One dates back to eighth-century India and is a rare depiction of a Hindu god and his entourage on horseback. ""The other  believed to be made in the tenth century  shows a Hindu teacher flanked by two attendants. ""Together, they're valued at almost a half-million dollars.""

i toggle caption Immigration and Customs Enforcement Immigration and Customs Enforcement

Agents of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations say the statues were recovered as part of an ongoing initiative called Operation Hidden Idol, which focuses on ""activities surrounding the illicit cultural property trade in New York."" Both stolen items came from a smuggler of looted antiquities. According to court documents, investigators found an unlabeled computer disc in a Manhattan storage facility in 2012, with a folder labeled ""Shantoo"" that contained images of stolen antiquities and names of dealers.

A person was charged in connection with the disc, and after pleading guilty to criminal possession of stolen property and related charges, that person became an informant for the investigation. An affidavit by a federal agent says the informant said ""Shantoo"" was a nickname for Ranjeet Kanwat, a ""known smuggler"" from India, and one of the main suppliers of stolen artifacts for Subhash Kapoor, who is currently awaiting extradition to New York in connection with more than $100 million in stolen antiquities.

Ambassador Riva Ganguly Das, consul general of India, praised the recovery of the ancient statues.

""My congratulations to all of the special agents of HSI New York, who have painstakingly and diligently undertaken these complex and time consuming investigations,"" he said.

Christie's auction house said it had no knowledge that the statues were stolen.

""Christie's devotes considerable resources to investigating the provenance of all objects we offer for sale. Under no circumstance would Christie's knowingly offer a work of art where there are valid concerns over provenance,"" the auction house said in a statement. ""This is one of the difficulties the art market faces in vetting antiquities, which is why Christie's very much values building strong relationships with and between countries of origin, law enforcement, archaeologists, and the collecting community.""

Christie's had been planning to auction the statues during Asia Week New York. Now it has removed them from the list of items for sale and is cooperating with investigators.

An ICE spokesperson said the antiquities ""will be repatriated to the government of India"" though no date has been set for their return.

According to an ICE press release, more than 8,000 artifacts have been returned to 30 countries since 2007. These items include paintings from France, Germany, Poland and Austria; 15th to 18th century manuscripts from Italy and Peru; as well as cultural artifacts from China, Cambodia and Iraq.",[]

Yesterday, NASA announced that astronaut Scott Kelly will retire from the space agency as of April 1st. Kelly holds the U.S. record for the most time spent in space.

For nearly a full year, he zoomed along at 17,500 miles per hour  orbiting 230 miles above earth  on the International Space Station. And for those million or so of us who follow him on Twitter, Cmdr. Kelly's year in space gave us a mind-expanding view of planet Earth.

Kelly posted spectacular photos  awesome, in the true sense of the word. He called them, earth-art.

Through his zoom lens, he snapped the majestic snowy cap of Mount Fuji from straight overhead. It looks like a barnacle.

The cracking blue ice of the Himalayas turns into a stunning lapis mosaic.

One day, Africa appears as a mass of crinkly brown veins; another, it's become vivid streaks of orange and gold.

Crimson and violet squiggles around Australia could be an abstract painting.

It seemed that Kelly never got tired of what he could see out the window, and what he could make us see, in an entirely new way.

When the capsule bearing Kelly and cosmonauts Mikhail Kornienko and Sergey Volkov parachuted to a landing in Kazakhstan earlier this month, that fantastic journey came to a close.

Back home in Houston, Scott Kelly will be poked and prodded, weighed and measured, all in the name of science.

And his terrestrial tweets now bring their own delights. He posted video of his first plunge into a pool!

A few days later - there was Scott Kelly with his arms stretched overhead, and a big smile - looking up at a dark sky:

That's #rain on #earth. ""I missed weather,"" he wrote.

Kelly has rejoiced in the simple pleasure of being able to sit down at a table for dinner! He's even excited about finally getting to go to the dentist for a teeth cleaning. I guess that's what a year in space will do to you.

Horses with manes and tails aflame stampede through the streets of Blitz-era London. Luftwaffe bombers attack, ""great clusters of them, like midges over a stagnant pond."" These are among the myriad indelible images that haunt Noonday, Pat Barker's powerful, ambitious historical novel. Depicting the lives of a group of young men and women struggling to survive during the weeks that German bombs lacerated the United Kingdom, the book completes the trilogy Barker embarked upon with Life Class and Toby's Room. Those novels returned to the WWI period setting of Barker's acclaimed Regeneration Trilogy, so Noonday represents her first fictional foray into World War II. The results are stirring.

Although this novel may be read as a stand-alone, fans of Life Class and Toby's Room will enjoy being reunited with Elinor Brooke, a painter whose talent has landed three of her canvases at the Tate. This being wartime, Elinor has put away her brushes to drive an ambulance at the Tottenham Court Road depot. Increasingly estranged from her husband Paul, also an artist, she harbors a long-simmering attraction to old art-school flame Kit Neville. The novel plumbs the intricacies of their relationship over the course of late summer and early fall 1940, as the 500-pounders pummel London from above.

Some of their passions have the cheap feel of a soap opera. When Elinor sits down for one of her regular heart to hearts with Paul or Kit you can almost see the bubbles rise in the room. Much of the story was too weepy for me; I would have found a drier approach to its people more believable, and more enjoyable. But the dominant character here is the Blitz itself, and in its portrayal Barker delivers her most affecting storytelling.

It's no mean feat to match the horror of a historical experience with horrific language and not go over the top into fright-show territory. Often enough, Pat Barker walks this line with sensory-thick language; its sweep makes us truly appreciate life and death in a decimated landscape.

War images are searing (literally, as fires burn everywhere, day and night), as well as up close and personal. ""The change was in the sky: beyond the black ridges of the rooftops, a red, sullen glare was growing and spreading, lit at intervals by the orange flashes of exploding bombs."" We smell the foul interiors of overnight shelters. We hear the crunch of glass underfoot as the shell-shocked denizens emerge from behind blackout curtains to kill the horror with glasses of sweet, numbing whisky. And we see oily smoke drifting over black roads, and bodies lying in the gutters ""like sodden heaps of rags.""

Noonday gives us bravery among the ruins: Elinor must leave her house when it is crushed by a bomb. The face of Kit Neville, who longs for their former passion, was ravaged in the last war and has been sewn together in a patchwork of pain. The women of the ambulance corps plaster themselves with cosmetics to offset the gray dust on their faces, the under-eye circles of exhaustion. Some of these scenes are as casual as they are unforgettable: A man's head rests upon a concrete sidewalk, ""severed neatly at the neck, one eye closed."" A child simply kicks it aside.

Effortlessly delivering beautiful toss-off sentences, Barker effectively captures the time and place: ""Even the roses, this summer, looked as if they were expecting to be bombed."" Her evocative language applies to more intimate personal matters, too  as her mother's heart beats its last, Elinor ""could almost believe she saw the dark, struggling muscle laboring away inside its cage of bone.""

Some of the language becomes bruise-purple; readers might not want to hear quite so much sentiment along the lines of ""Nightmares crawled across each other like copulating toads."" It's no mean feat to match the horror of a historical experience with horrific language and not go over the top into fright-show territory. Often enough, Pat Barker walks this line with sensory-thick language; its sweep makes us truly appreciate life and death in a decimated landscape: ""London: no longer one of the world's great centers of civilization, but merely a settlement on a river, lit by guttering candles after dark.""

Another day, another Hitler comparison on The Internet.

Of course, America's online Hitler-of-the-moment is Donald Trump, and he's been that for the last few months, with Trump himself seeming to fuel the fire.

The Hitler comparisons skyrocketed after last weekend when Trump asked supporters at a recent rally to raise their right hands and pledge to vote for him.

Donald Trump makes members of his Orlando crowd raise their right hands and swear to vote in the primary. pic.twitter.com/EVenRilJrV  Jenna Johnson (@wpjenna) March 5, 2016

Opponents of Trump's tried to say the image looked like a Nazi salute. (Rival Ted Cruz tried to take advantage of the attention-grabbing gesture, turning it on Trump this way at Thursday's debate: ""This is a job interview. We are here pledging our support to you, not the other way around."")

So, cue another round of ""Trump is Hitler"" think pieces and tweets and cable news conversations.

So far, celebrities, like conservative talk-show host Glenn Beck and comedian Louis C.K., have compared Trump to Hitler, and even world leaders, past and present, like Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and former Mexican president Vicente Fox have done it, too.

""I don't want to offend anybody, but I can tell you that it's been amazingly received,"" Trump said of the hand-raised pledge. CNN reported that Trump said, ""I don't know about the Hitler comparison. I hadn't heard that, but it's a terrible comparison. I'm not happy about that certainly."" He continued, ""Well, I think it's [the comparisons] ridiculous, I mean we're having such a great time.""

Remember Godwin's Law

It's important to note that Trump is not the first man to be compared to the former German leader, and he will not be the last.

In fact, there's an entire Internet law all about Hitler/Nazi/Holocaust comparisons. It's called Godwin's Law of Nazi Analogies. It's pretty simple: ""As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one.""

Mike Godwin created that theory in 1990. So, as fresh as this outrage may seem, it is actually just a new iteration of an online trope. And it's more than Hitler comparisons. Remember when people were comparing Obamacare to slavery?

Kerric Harvey, author of the Encyclopedia of Social Media and Politics, says there's a problem with these types of comparisons.

""It oversimplifies both sides of the comparison,"" she told NPR. ""When a conservative says, 'Obamacare is slavery,' they're really oversimplifying both Obamacare and slavery in ways that are not helpful.... And they actually sort of cover up the kinds of nuanced, important points in each side.""

Harvey also says these types of comparisons rarely accomplish the attempted goal: getting people to change their minds on an issue. ""If you call Trump Hitler to a Trump supporter, it's actually the case that they're just going to dig in their heels and support him even more,"" Harvey said, ""because they will find that comparison so outrageous.

""The metaphor almost works against itself if what you're really trying to do is explain what you mean. If what you're trying to do is arouse knee-jerk reaction, at an extreme level, then that kind of comparison does a lot of work for you. But does it add a lot of good to ongoing public discourse? I don't think so.""

But Godwin says there are times the comparison is OK

Godwin told NPR that comparing something or someone to Hitler isn't always bad.

""Well, I never say that the comparisons shut down the argument,"" he said. ""Other people have said that maybe it does. And it's certainly true that people interpret Godwin's Law to say that once you get to the Hitler comparison, the meaningful discussion is over. [But] I don't think that's true.

""What you want to see happen is people, if they're going to make a historical reference like that, they have to actually know what they're talking about. You have to ask people, 'How can you say that, or what specifically are you basing this on,' and force them to get to the facts.""

But, in an age of social media, that might be increasingly difficult.

'Novel-length issues by the first line of a haiku'

Kerric Harvey, says there are two reasons this is the case. First, brevity.

""Almost all of our social media are ways of reacting to complicated long-term enduring social issues and political tangles,"" Harvey said, ""in very short times. We have 140 characters [on Twitter]. We have one picture [on Instagram]... We've got, what is it, [in a Vine loop] seven seconds? We try to deal with novel-length issues by the first line of a haiku.""

She also says there's a pressure to make all those responses, all those Hitler memes as quickly as you can.

""The knee-jerk aspect, the immediacy that our social media don't just permit us, but almost demand of us,"" she said. ""And that is not built into the technology. That is sociological. We have decided that because we can respond right away, we're going to respond right away.""

When asked if this might change anytime soon, Harvey said no.

""It's not impossible, but it feels impossible,"" she said. ""It's like trying to slam on the brakes on the Titanic, so you don't hit that iceberg.""",[]

i Sam Rowe for NPR Sam Rowe for NPR

When I first read Originals I couldn't help but take notes. What I jotted down was essentially a to-do list for how I could be more creative, how I could think up and then communicate new ideas.

But the book  written by Adam Grant, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania  is not just a guide for adults.

Its pages are littered with interesting advice on how teachers and parents can encourage and cultivate their kids to be original, too.

Grant writes about the importance of getting kids to take risks, to embrace their own curiosity and to be confident in where their minds wander. So how can adults create spaces and cultures of originality to breed these new ideas?

In the book you talk about how taking risks can lead to original ideas. So how can parents facilitate risk-taking with their kids?

Well, I think one of the biggest mistakes that a lot of parents make is they spend all their time enforcing rules, and I'm guilty of this. Every time one of my daughters misbehaves, I'm like, ""New rule!"" And then I don't end up doing a whole lot with it.

But the sad thing about rules is that they don't teach kids to think for themselves. And kids try to figure out how they can either avoid taking risks altogether, or to take risks that they can get away with. As opposed to learning to take sensible risks that will allow them to try new things.

When you study the parents who raised kids who go on to do greater things  like become some of America's most creative architects  you see this. That they focus much more on teaching values than rules. Instead of, ""Here's the list of things that you're allowed to do and not to do,"" they say, ""Here are the principles that are important in this family, and let's talk about how you want to express them.""

And kids then end up defining the values for themselves, and are much more likely to go against the grain and take risks that allow them to live by these values but don't necessarily match up with conventions or social norms. And the upshot of that is, they're much more likely to become original.

So what about having kids do chores? Is that a bad practice?

No, of course you should have your kids do chores. So what you see is that enforcing a bunch of rules is not a problem as long as you explain why they matter. So it's not about saying there are rewards and punishments. It's about saying, ""Here are the rules we have. And this is what they mean to us. This is how they really connect with our core values.""

That kind of sounds like talking to kids like adults? Kind of explaining the background of things?

Yeah. It's very much about raising kids to have responsibility. So, you know, when your kids are going to do chores, you say, ""Look. This is why it's important to us to have a neat and clean house."" Or, ""This is why we care about respecting our things."" And then you give your kids some responsibility and guess what? They actually love it.

It's the idea that they can be in charge of things. That they can be helpers. That they have something to contribute. If you frame it right, you're doing them a favor, right? As opposed to, sort of, constraining their freedom.

Are there ways that schools or school leaders can incorporate some of the things in your book to create a culture around originality?

I think there are lots of ways. So the first thing is that there's some really cool evidence showing that kids are much more likely to think in original ways if you teach them in conditionals rather than in absolutes.

So instead of saying, you know, ""This is a book,"" you teach them, ""This could be a book."" And then they're more likely to ask questions about the things that they say as opposed to assuming that there's one right answer. We could do a lot more conditional teaching. I think we could do a lot more encouraging kids to ask questions about multiple possibilities as opposed to searching for the one correct answer.

Any other suggestions for teachers?

I think another thing that I would love to see teachers do more of is called the jigsaw classroom. So, [a] classic study: Back in 1971, this great psychologist, Elliot Aronson, wants to reduce prejudice in Texas when schools are desegregating.

And he says, ""Maybe we could get kids to listen to each other and respect each other if we gave them group projects where they had to put together pieces, just like a jigsaw puzzle.""

So let's say you're writing a biography of Eleanor Roosevelt as a group and then you're going to present it. And there are four of you.

One of you is going to take ownership over her early years. Second, her early adulthood. The third will get middle age. And so on. And then you each have to bring a written piece of that project together and then you each have to deliver your segment on it. We found when kids were assigned to put these projects together in jigsaws, they became less prejudiced. They were less likely to stereotype each other.

Even if you were working with someone who had an accent that was unfamiliar to you or who looked different from you, you were much more likely to say, ""Wow, you have some real insights to bring to the table. I did not know that.""

And I think that this is a great way to nurture original thinking, too. Because it gives every child a chance to approach a problem from a novel vantage point and say, ""Look, I can say anything I want about, you know, a decade of Eleanor Roosevelt's life ... what's interesting to me? And what do I want to zoom in on?""

As opposed to looking for one way to do it. And I think that kind of model is pretty great for students.

That gets me thinking about group work in general. How does working in groups contribute to original thinking?

You know, if you look at brainstorming research, we've got, now, almost half a century of experiments and field studies. What you see is that if you take five students and put them in a brainstorming group together, you will get fewer ideas and less original ideas than if you had taken those same five students and let them work independently, in separate rooms, by themselves.

And teachers find this maddening when they learn about it, because it goes against the idea of teaching teamwork and two heads are better than one. But there a few things that happen that make brainstorming groups less than the sum of their parts.

One is called production blocking, and it's the basic idea that we can't all talk at once. And as a result, some ideas and some students just don't get heard. Two, there's ego threat, where kids are nervous about looking stupid or foolish, so they hold back on their most original ideas. And then, three is conformity. One or two ideas get raised that are popular. Everyone wants to jump on the majority bandwagon, as opposed to bringing in some radical, different ways of thinking.

You put kids in separate rooms, what you get is all of the ideas on the table, and then you can bring the group together for what the group does best, which is the wisdom of crowds. The evaluating. The idea selecting. The figuring out which of these ideas really has potential to be, not only novel, but also useful.

And I think that's where you teach kids to work together effectively in groups. You say that individual idea generation works together really well, but then the group can come together to figure out which ideas to really bet on.

That technique is actually called brain writing. Instead of brainstorm. It's a great term and I think we should do more of it.

Have there been any changes in your own classroom at Penn that have come out of the research from this book? Anything that you've implemented or that you've changed in your teaching style.

All right, so a couple of years ago, when I was writing Originals, I took a look at my syllabus and realized that I was not doing a good job of getting students to think in original ways. I teach a whole course that's evidence-based management. So it's psychology applied to work, where students are supposed to learn what the best data can tell them about how to lead and manage and operate differently.

And I wasn't creating many avenues to let them challenge the assumptions that we were bringing in. So I decided I was going to shake things up a little bit, because I don't enjoy being a hypocrite if I can avoid it, and I assigned them to work on their own mini TED Talk in pairs. Every student had a partner. They were supposed to film a video of five minutes or less on an idea that they believed in that went against the grain or challenged conventional wisdom.

They can pick any topic in the course, but they had to champion a message that was counter-intuitive, and you know, bring some evidence and experience to bear on it. And I was blown away by how interesting and novel their ideas were. And I realized that they had all this latent potential for thinking outside the box that I was stifling by just asking them to apply course concepts to their problems.

And I've been doing this assignment ever since and I think for many students, it's their favorite project in the course.

So it would be remiss for me to fail to mention my favorite part of your book: Procrastination can lead to originality. What do teachers do with this? What have you done with it in your classroom?

Look, let me confess. I am a precrastinator, not a procrastinator. That's an actual term for someone who likes to dive into things as early as possible and finish them ahead of schedule. And I have always worn this like a badge of honor. I finished my doctoral dissertation two years before it was due. I wrapped up my undergrad college thesis four months before the deadline. And I thought this was a great way to be productive.

And then I found that precrastination is a virtue for productivity, but it's kind of a vice for creativity. I had a student who did all this research in a bunch of companies showing that precrastinators like me, who did everything early, were less creative than people who procrastinated, as rated by their bosses.

And then we followed up and did some experiments where we randomly assigned people to procrastinate, which is a fun task. After a lot of follow up research, what we discovered was great originality comes from being quick to start but slow to finish. That when you dive right into a task, you close yourself off to incubation. If you finish early, you're stuck only with your most conventional ideas, your first ones. You never have time teacher think outside the box.

You also tend to think much more in linear, structured ways, as opposed to making these random connections and unexpected leaps that you do when you're putting off the completion of a task. So the lesson here is that you want to give students time to let ideas marinate.

So when you're working on a creative project, having a due date that's a couple of hours later isn't always the best way to go. And that sometimes what you can do is you can assign a task. You can have them work on it. And then you can extend the deadline and say I want you to go back to the drawing board and consider all those unexpected ideas that you just didn't have time to look at before.

And then there's an opportunity to open up a little more original thinking than they had before, but of course, if they procrastinate to the last minute, they're not going to be creative either because then they just have to rush to panic to do the first ideas as opposed to the most novel ideas.

So can I confirm that on the record you are saying that extensions are a good thing?

I don't think they're always a good thing. I think we need to strike a balance between training students to get things done and training them to wait for the right time. How's that?",[]

One dog has been killed and multiple dogs have been injured by a snowmobiler in what appears to be an intentional attack on competitors in the Iditarod Race in Alaska.

Iditarod veteran Aliy Zirkle was the first to report an attack.

A snowmachiner had ""repeatedly attempted to harm her and her team,"" the Iditarod Trail Committee says, and one of Zirkle's dogs had received a non-life-threatening injury.

Zirkle reported the attack when she arrived in Nulato, Alaska, in the wee hours of the morning, and race officials and law enforcement were notified.

Then Jeff King, a four-time Iditarod champion who was behind Zirkle, reported a similar encounter.

King's team was hit by a snowmobiler, injuring several dogs and killing one  Nash, a 3-year-old male.

Reporter Emily Schwing tells our Newscast unit that King's sled has lights and reflectors.

""It really felt like reckless bravado and playing chicken,"" King told Emily.

Zachariah Hughes, a reporter for Alaska Public Media, says that neither King nor Zirkle were injured, according to state troopers.

A suspect has been identified, race officials say, and an investigation has begun.

""Regrettably, this incident very much alters the race of the two mushers competing for a win,"" the Trail Committee writes. ""However, both are going to continue on their way toward Nome.""

After a four-hour rest, Zirkle left Nulato  leaving one dog behind  in third place. King is still at the checkpoint as of 1 p.m. Eastern.

Emily says on Twitter that King explained, ""I'm not gonna let this schmuck take any more of the fun away.""

While combing through various Civil War files at the National Archives, a volunteer recently discovered a letter written by poet and essayist Walt Whitman on behalf of a Union soldier dying in a hospital far from home.

The National Archives is the repository of the nation's most important documents, including some they didn't even know they had, like said letter.

Washington, Jan. 21, 1865(6) My Dear Wife, You must excuse me for not having written to you before. I have not been very well + did not feel much like writing  but I feel considerably better now  my complaint is an affection of the lungs. I am mustered out of service, but am not at present well enough to come home. I hope you will try to write back as soon as you receive this + let me know how you all are, how things are going on  let me know how it is with mother. I write this by means of a friend who is now sitting by my side + I hope it will be God's will that we shall yet meet again. Well I send you all my love + must now close. Your affectionate husband,

Nelson Jabo Written by Walt Whitman

a friend.

The post-Civil War letter was discovered in February. Despite Whitman's claims to have written hundreds of letters for soldiers he would visit in hospitals, it is one of only three that researchers have been able to find with Whitman's name on it, says Jackie Budell, a specialist with the National Archives.

""He just literally visited people. And he bought stationery and he would bring it with him and he would offer to write letters home for them,"" she tells NPR's Michel Martin. ""Many [soldiers] were illiterate but also many were just too sickly to write so he would offer to do that.""

Whitman described his visits to wounded soldiers in an 1864 article in The New York Times.

Many sick and wounded soldiers have not written home to parents, brothers, sisters, and even wives, for one reason or another, for a long, long time. Some are poor writers, some cannot get paper and envelopes; many have an aversion to writing because they dread to worry the folks at home  the facts about them are so sad to tell. I always encourage the men to write, and promptly write for them.

""Hospitals during the Civil War were not a safe place to be, so it's really very admirable that he chose to be a volunteer in the hospitals,"" Budell says. Whitman had a government job but would frequently leave work early to visit the men.

""My custom is to go through a ward, or collection of wards, endeavoring to give some trifle to each, without missing any,"" Whitman writes in the Times. ""Even a sweet biscuit, a sheet of paper, or a passing word of friendliness, or but a look or nod, if no more.""

Whitman gave out fruit, candy or small amounts of change, Budell says. ""But I do think it was his investment of time and the emotion that he showed the boys that was probably what they were looking for the most.""

The newest discovery is believed to have been written in 1866, despite the 1865 date, according to The Washington Post.

Whitman was writing on behalf of Robert Nelson Jabo, a French Canadian who had been living in Clinton County, N.Y. The letter is addressed to Jabo's wife, who was named Adeline. The couple had six children at home, Budell says. Budo spent most of his time between 1861 and 1866 in the service, and died in 1866.

""I think Walt's time was the most important gift that he was giving these men,"" Budell says. ""Really they just needed someone to sit by their side.""

More of Whitman's diary entries from his time during the war are collected in the book Memoranda During the War. Whitman wants readers to remember (though maybe not too much) the ""lurid interiors"" and ""Hospital part of the drama""  those struggles of the Civil War apart from the dramatic outdoor battles.

Future years will never know the seething hell and the black infernal background of countless minor scenes and interiors, (not the few great battles) of the Secession War; and it is best they should not. In the mushy influences of current times the fervid atmosphere and typical events of those years are in danger of being totally forgotten.

""I'm sure many of [the soldiers] kind of knew what was about to happen to them,"" Budell says. ""And so they didn't want to worry family at home, but at the same time still wanted to give some parting thoughts to a wife or a mom who wondered where they were.""

Whitman's skill as a poet and writer also helped the men, who may not have been able to fully express themselves, Budell says. ""You can envision that he was, in effect, kind of helping them to verbalize maybe what they weren't able to say.""",[]

Those of you in Hawaii, most of Arizona, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianas, go ahead and feel smug.

Everyone else: prepare to lose an hour tonight, as Daylight Saving Time begins and the clocks shift forward.

Daylight saving time means an extra hour of daylight in the evening, and darkness stretching a little further into the morning. The idea is that it makes daylight hours match up with the hours when people want to be active, and saves on energy use.

Whether daylight saving time achieves any of its aims is hotly disputed.

But it does mess with our circadian clocks  especially springing forward  and it certainly ticks people off.

Complaints about the change are as regular as, well, clockwork.

The Associated Press reported this week that some states are discussing joining the ranks of the daylight saving holdouts  while at least one state legislator is proposing switching over, and never switching back:

""California has a bill that would ask voters to abolish the practice of changing clocks twice a year. Lawmakers in Alaska and nearly a dozen other states are debating similar measures. Some lawmakers in New England want to go even further, seceding from the populous Eastern Time Zone and throwing their lot in with Nova Scotia and Puerto Rico. "" 'Once we spring forward, I don't want to fall back,' said Rhode Island state Rep. Blake Filippi, who hopes the whole region will shift one hour eastward, into the Atlantic Time Zone. 'Pretty much everyone I speak to would rather have it light in the evening than light first thing in the morning,' he said. ... ""Shifting to Atlantic Time and never changing back would effectively make summertime daylight saving hours permanent, said Filippi, who made a public health case for his bill at a Rhode Island State House hearing this week.""

Meanwhile, as more and more of our devices automatically adjust to the time change, there's one manual task to consider: Fire departments across the country are asking residents to check the batteries in their smoke alarms tonight.",[]

i Courtesy of Mountain Apple Company Courtesy of Mountain Apple Company

The late Hawaiian musician Israel Kamakawiwo'ole (Kah-MAH-kah-VEE-voh-OH-lay), did something rare in music. He redefined a beloved classic.

His version of ""Over the Rainbow"" has the poignancy of Judy Garland's and the shimmering vulnerability, but these days it's heard so often on TV and in the movies, a younger generation may only know Israel's version. It's become so popular, it is now the most requested version of the song by far, according to music publishing house EMI. That's quite remarkable for a rendition with one voice, accompanied only by ukulele.

""In Hawaii, we talk about this thing we call mana,"" says musician Del Beazley, who grew up with Israel and wrote two of his songs. ""Mana is like an energy that you get. We believe we get ours from the elements first, the Earth, your sky, your ocean, your God, and all that is inside of us. And when we open our mouth to speak, to sing or to play, that's what we let out. But it's that that makes him [Israel] special, because his mana always came out.""

Beazley remembers the first time he heard Israel sing.

They were teenagers and Israel showed up with his older brother Skippy at a graduation party.

""They set up with instruments that were kind of beat up. In fact, one of the ukuleles was held together with bubble gum. What happened was, as soon as Israel Kamakawiwo'ole opened his mouth and sang, that whole place went quiet. Every great singer has something special. It's almost a nasal or head tone. And that thing just cut right through the air, stopped everybody in their tracks.""

Israel was still a teenager when he and his brother formed a band with three other local guys. They called themselves the Makaha Sons of Ni'ihau. In the 1970s, young Hawaiians were rediscovering their language and culture. In music, that meant getting away from kitschy hula tunes for tourists, like ""My Little Grass Shack."" Israel's group was among those who embraced traditional melodies.

Israel was the group's standout  for his voice and also his size. Both he and Skippy weighed hundreds of pounds  the girth of sumo wrestlers. Israel was over 6 feet tall with flowing black hair.

The 1988 Recording Session That Made Him A Legend

It began at 3 in the morning. Milan Bertosa was at the end of a long day in his Honolulu recording studio.

""And the phone rings. It was a client of mine,"" Bertosa remembers. The client rattled off Israel's unpronounceable name and said he wanted to come in and record a demo. Bertosa said he was shutting down, call tomorrow. But the client insisted on putting Israel on the phone. ""And he's this really sweet man, well-mannered, kind. 'Please, can I come in? I have an idea,' "" Bertosa remembers Israel saying.

Bertosa relented and gave Israel 15 minutes to get there. Soon, there was a knock at the door.

""And in walks the largest human being I had seen in my life. Israel was probably like 500 pounds. And the first thing at hand is to find something for him to sit on."" The building security found Israel a big steel chair. ""Then I put up some microphones, do a quick sound check, roll tape, and the first thing he does is 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow.' He played and sang, one take, and it was over.""

The next day, Bertosa made a copy for Israel and filed the original recording away. But he was so taken with it, that over the next few years, he played it occasionally for family and friends. ""It was that special,"" he says. ""Whatever was going on that night, he was inspired. It was like we just caught the moment.""

Jump Ahead Five Years

In 1993, Milan Bertosa wound up working as an engineer for Mountain Apple Company in Honolulu, a long-established recording house, where Israel was making a solo album. As Bertosa listened during the final days of recording, he had an epiphany. He turned to producer Jon de Mello and said, ""This is great, but there's more."" Bertosa fished out ""Over the Rainbow"" and played it for de Mello.

""Israel was really sparkly, really alive,"" recalls de Mello after hearing the recording. ""He had a grand heart attack in 1989, so this was right before his heart attack."" De Mello put ""Over the Rainbow"" (actually a medley, with ""What a Wonderful World"") on Facing Future, which is still the best-selling Hawaiian album of all time, thanks to one song.

""There's been a bunch of articles written about 'Over the Rainbow,' "" says Bertosa. ""He gets the lyrics wrong, he changes the melody. If you sat there with a book and a score card, you could count the mistakes or you could listen to the song and smile.""

Family Struggles

Israel weighed close to 700 pounds when he came to de Mello to start a solo career in 1993. He was in and out of the hospital.

His brother Skippy died from complications of obesity, as had almost all of Israel's immediate family. He knew he was destined for a brief life. To de Mello, everything Israel sang and said became precious. So he instructed his engineers to keep the tape rolling for all the rehearsals, all the jokes.

Israel was a very funny man, he says. ""And every session, I would keep him for an hour afterwards."" Just tell me stories, he told Israel. ""There was such great content in what this beautiful Hawaiian man was talking about  the trials and tribulations of his own life and his family's life.""

""I was scared when I lost my mother, my father, my brother, my sister,"" Israel told de Mello. ""I guess this is gonna sound kind of weird, but I'm not scared for myself for dying. Because I believe all these places are temporary. This is just one shell. Because we Hawaiians live in both worlds. It's in our veins. When our time come, don't cry for me. Don't cry for me. Plant a tree in the middle ... where they play soccer,"" he laughs. ""Kind of small, then I'll grow big.""

In the summer of 1997, Israel Kamakawiwo'ole , by then one of the most beloved singers in the history of Hawaiian music, died of respiratory failure. He was 38  and just beginning to see the huge success of ""Over the Rainbow.""

Israel's body lay in state at Hawaii's Capitol building, a rare honor.

Days later, he was cremated, along with his vintage Martin ukulele  the one he used to record ""Over the Rainbow."" The ashes were carried on a traditional Hawaiian voyaging canoe.

His longtime friend Del Beazley and producer Jon de Mello were among those onboard.

""And going down the coastline,"" says de Mello, ""all the big semi-trucks on the island of Oahu had their air horns blowing. And from the ocean we could hear the echo, the bounce off the mountain ranges.""

""In the old days,"" says Beazley, ""people would wail when the mo'i or 'king' passed away  and cry. And that's really what it was. This whole island came together just to say goodbye to this one Hawaiian. But I tell you, he would have been laughing.""",[]

It was the first time ever that an Alaskan athlete didn't win gold in the Alaskan high kick. Earlier this week, at the Arctic Winter Games in Nuuk, Greenland, a hometown athlete named Bent Jakobsen won the gymnastic event  which requires athletes to begin from a sitting position and end in a one-hand handstand to kick a ball suspended above. The crowd went wild.

The Arctic Winter Games, held March 6 to 11, are the Olympics of traditional Inuit sports. The Alaskan high kick is one of about a dozen indigenous games at the event. Others include the stick pull, the sledge jump and the finger pull. More than 1,700 male and female athletes from Russia, Canada and Alaska traveled thousands of miles to Nuuk to compete.

Despite the high stakes of an international sports championship, the games  held every other year since 1970  are meant to be collaborative, making the week feel more like a casual sports festival than a competitive pressure cooker.

Athletes from different countries even offer advice to their competitors while they are competing. During the Alaskan high kick, an Alaskan athlete helped coach an athlete from Canada's Northwest Territories to his highest kick ever.

Many of the sports are inspired by daily life in the Arctic  or at least a version of daily life that includes hunting and fishing for survival. It's a way of living that is quickly disappearing as the Arctic region urbanizes.

Since World War II, commercial fishing, logging and oil drilling have pushed much of the circumpolar region away from a subsistence hunting economy and into one dominated by more centralized, modern industry and trade. The pace of modernization has been rapid, and fewer and fewer people are living the lifestyle these games originate from.

One game, the stick pull, involves holding onto a short, tapered stick that's slathered in grease to resemble a slimy fish. Two athletes grasp the stick, and the one who can pull the stick away from the other wins.

""It's a survival technique made into a game,"" explains Tonny Fisker, a Greenlandic athlete who has competed in seven Arctic Winter Games. ""All the games have different stories.""

In the triple jump, similar to the track and field sport of the same name, competitors jump with both feet three times in quick succession. Whoever jumps the longest distance wins.

""If you're on the ice and the ice is breaking up,"" Fisker says, ""you have jump from ice to ice. I tried it when I was younger.""

Of course, the big difference between real life and the game is that in the gym, there's no freezing ocean to drown in.

This is the first time Nuuk has hosted the Arctic Winter Games, and it was an enormous logistical challenge for the town of 17,000 to host more than 2,000 guests.

The government closed the schools and turned them into dormitories for the athletes. The town bought extra buses and Air Greenland, the national carrier, stopped all regular flights to use every plane it has to shuttle teams to and from Nuuk. Regular flights will resume after the athletes leave on Saturday.

The mayor of Nuuk, Asii Chemnitz Narup, says that even showers are an issue. ""We had to make sure we had the water capacity, the electricity, everything,"" she says. ""And there is the weather. We cannot control the weather, but we wish we could.""

A blizzard on the first day of the Games didn't stop events from going forward. On Tuesday, when the first biathlon race began, it was still snowing and windy.

Greenland's Ukaleq Slettemark, 14, won the 7.5-km [4.6 mile] biathlon, a combination of cross-country skiing and shooting, for her age group. She explains that shooting is part of her everyday life in Nuuk. She loves hunting with her family.

The U.S. has ramped up oil production so dramatically that it's joined Saudi Arabia and Russia as one of the world's largest producers. Just glance at the chart below.

Since this surge began in 2008, American production rocketed from 5 million barrels a day to nearly 10 million barrels a day at the high point last year.

More importantly, oil analysts confidently predicted that a tide of benefits would flow as freely as the oil now coming out of the ground.

First, the U.S. economy would get a boost that would include a renaissance in manufacturing. Second, the U.S. would be far less dependent on the vagaries of foreign energy producers. And third, America could shrink its footprint in the volatile Middle East.

Yet none of this has happened. Why not?

Forecast No. 1: An Economic Boost



The boom, fueled by shale oil fields in places like North Dakota, was supposed to turbo-charge the economy. Energy would be abundant and cheap. Consumers would have more money to spend on other stuff.

And that's all true. You see it in places like convenience stores. When it costs drivers less to fill up the tank, they buy more soda. Good for Coke. Good for Pepsi.

But many forecasters failed to see the other side of the equation. More American companies and workers are now linked directly or indirectly to the oil industry, and they get hurt when prices go down.

""Actually, oil has become more important to the U.S. economy because of this almost doubling of U.S. oil production,"" said Daniel Yergin, the author of best-selling books on the industry, including The Prize and The Quest.

Americans used to worry only about high oil prices, he noted. But now the country needs to consider what happens when prices go down.

""You have people working all across the United States that are in effect part of the supply chains. So when the oil price goes down, and companies cut spending, this reverberates in Illinois, Ohio and many other states,"" said Yergin, who is vice chairman of the economics firm IHS.

The U.S. economy has grown steadily since the 2008-2009 recession. But that growth has been modest compared to previous recoveries. Since oil prices crashed in the summer of 2014, going from more than $100 a barrel to around $30 today, the economy has continued at roughly the same pace.

So what's the overall impact of cheap oil? Yergin describes it as a ""titter-totter."" Some gains here, some losses there, but overall, pretty neutral.

Forecast No. 2: Energy Independence



U.S. imports have dropped dramatically, but this really hasn't set the U.S. free in the ways anticipated.

All this new American oil contributes to the current worldwide glut and the low prices. And neither the U.S. nor any other country wants to be the one that cuts back and sacrifices its own production for the greater good.

""Someone has to cry uncle,"" says oil analyst Steve LeVine, who writes for Quartz and teaches at Georgetown University. ""The conventional wisdom is that American shale oil producers will be the ones. And they are in trouble.""

The reason is cost. Saudi Arabia and other low-cost producers still make a profit when oil is $30 a barrel. Much of the U.S. production is relatively high-cost, and many companies are losing money at the current price.

Every day, world production of oil exceeds demand by more than 1 million barrels. Many countries are running low on places to store the excess.

In the U.S., that place is Cushing, Oklahoma, home of huge and rapidly filling storage tanks, LeVine says.

Some 500 million barrels of oil are in storage around the world, says LeVine.

""That's the largest volume in storage since the Great Depression,"" he notes, adding that some forecasters are predicting that if storage runs out, oil could go below $20 a barrel.

Forecast No. 3: U.S. Pulls Back In The Middle East



Forecasters also argued that more U.S. oil would mean a reduced American need to resolve conflicts in the Middle East. Oil was, after all, the main reason the U.S. was drawn into the region decades ago.

But here's the catch: Cheap oil can destabilize Middle Eastern countries that depend almost entirely on oil revenue.

Consider Iraq. It's desperately short of cash as it fights the Islamic State and tries to stay current on salaries to millions of government workers.

President Obama pledged to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he has withdrawn the large contingents of U.S. large ground forces. Yet in Obama's final year in office, the U.S. is still engaged in three regional wars  Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria  and dealing with instability throughout the region.

All the forecasts looked at the potential upside of more American oil, but never fully factored in the downside.

Danai Gurira often calls herself a ""Zimerican."" The actress and playwright  who you may know best as Michonne, the samurai sword-wielding zombie slayer on The Walking Dead  was born in Iowa, to Zimbabwean parents, and the family moved back to Harare when she was just five. She returned to the U.S. for college and has stayed ever since.

""I was always in a hodgepodge of culture  there's no other identity I know, really,"" she says.

And that makes her uniquely suited to tell stories from both sides of the Atlantic. She's now toggling between rehearsals and performances for two plays that she's written, both currently running in New York.

""What drives her is so profoundly meaningful,"" says Rebecca Taichman, director of Gurira's off-Broadway comedy-drama called Familiar. ""I think it must be part of what supplies the energy. It's not ego, it's not narcissism; it's ... a very profound desire to tell African stories on American stages.""

Familiar takes place in Minnesota, where the eldest daughter of Zimbabwean parents is getting married to a white man. Gurira says it was taken from her own observations.

""I was at a wedding and I was just struck by all of my family's absurdities  and my own included,"" she says. ""I just knew I couldn't not write about it!""

So, she dives headfirst into the culture clash between American and African traditions While the upper middle class trappings of Familiar may be familiar to American audiences, the setting of Eclipsed  Gurira's Broadway debut  is something else entirely. She was inspired to write it after reading an article in The New York Times about the Civil War in Liberia and young women who fought in it.

""These were, like, 22-, 23-year-old girls, women, who had, like, you know, little skimpy jeans on, little skimpy tops, really looked cool and hip and current and then, they had these big AK-47s on their backs,"" she says.

Years later, she went to Liberia and met with many women  former soldiers, sex slaves and peace negotiators  and based the play on their stories. Academy Award winning actress Lupita Nyong'o plays a 15-year-old girl, captured by the rebels, who is struggling to survive an impossible situation. Nyong'o says the girl is caught between being serially raped by a commander and thinking she can find her freedom in the rebel army.

""I think the Girl is our way into this world,"" Nyong'o explains, ""because the war has touched her, very recently. And so she comes into this world and is trying to figure out what the rules are, at war. And she has to make a lot of choices about how she intends to survive.""

Gurira says through the girl's experiences, the audience is left with larger questions.

""What do we have left after a war?"" she asks. ""What is in the souls and the spirits and the psyches and the remains of those who get through it; and especially the young who haven't even been able to, you know, like formulate themselves into full adults before they were taken into something this vicious and cruel?""

It's been an intense few months for Gurira, with two plays opening, as well as working on her movie and TV roles. (In addition to her role on The Walking Dead, she's also playing Tupac Shakur's mother in the biopic All Eyez on Me.)

""There are times when I hit a wall and I just have to be, like: 'Guys, I need the evening to myself to like, regenerate,' you know?"" she says, laughing. ""But it's good. It's all good.""

The U.S. has ramped up oil production so dramatically that it's joined Saudi Arabia and Russia as one of the world's largest producers. Just glance at the chart below.

Since this surge began in 2008, American production rocketed from 5 million barrels a day to nearly 10 million barrels a day at the high point last year.

More importantly, oil analysts confidently predicted that a tide of benefits would flow as freely as the oil now coming out of the ground.

First, the U.S. economy would get a boost that would include a renaissance in manufacturing. Second, the U.S. would be far less dependent on the vagaries of foreign energy producers. And third, America could shrink its footprint in the volatile Middle East.

Yet none of this has happened. Why not?

Forecast No. 1: An Economic Boost



The boom, fueled by shale oil fields in places like North Dakota, was supposed to turbo-charge the economy. Energy would be abundant and cheap. Consumers would have more money to spend on other stuff.

And that's all true. You see it in places like convenience stores. When it costs drivers less to fill up the tank, they buy more soda. Good for Coke. Good for Pepsi.

But many forecasters failed to see the other side of the equation. More American companies and workers are now linked directly or indirectly to the oil industry, and they get hurt when prices go down.

""Actually, oil has become more important to the U.S. economy because of this almost doubling of U.S. oil production,"" said Daniel Yergin, the author of best-selling books on the industry, including The Prize and The Quest.

Americans used to worry only about high oil prices, he noted. But now the country needs to consider what happens when prices go down.

""You have people working all across the United States that are in effect part of the supply chains. So when the oil price goes down, and companies cut spending, this reverberates in Illinois, Ohio and many other states,"" said Yergin, who is vice chairman of the economics firm IHS.

The U.S. economy has grown steadily since the 2008-2009 recession. But that growth has been modest compared to previous recoveries. Since oil prices crashed in the summer of 2014, going from more than $100 a barrel to around $30 today, the economy has continued at roughly the same pace.

So what's the overall impact of cheap oil? Yergin describes it as a ""titter-totter."" Some gains here, some losses there, but overall, pretty neutral.

Forecast No. 2: Energy Independence



U.S. imports have dropped dramatically, but this really hasn't set the U.S. free in the ways anticipated.

All this new American oil contributes to the current worldwide glut and the low prices. And neither the U.S. nor any other country wants to be the one that cuts back and sacrifices its own production for the greater good.

""Someone has to cry uncle,"" says oil analyst Steve LeVine, who writes for Quartz and teaches at Georgetown University. ""The conventional wisdom is that American shale oil producers will be the ones. And they are in trouble.""

The reason is cost. Saudi Arabia and other low-cost producers still make a profit when oil is $30 a barrel. Much of the U.S. production is relatively high-cost, and many companies are losing money at the current price.

Every day, world production of oil exceeds demand by more than 1 million barrels. Many countries are running low on places to store the excess.

In the U.S., that place is Cushing, Oklahoma, home of huge and rapidly filling storage tanks, LeVine says.

Some 500 million barrels of oil are in storage around the world, says LeVine.

""That's the largest volume in storage since the Great Depression,"" he notes, adding that some forecasters are predicting that if storage runs out, oil could go below $20 a barrel.

Forecast No. 3: U.S. Pulls Back In The Middle East



Forecasters also argued that more U.S. oil would mean a reduced American need to resolve conflicts in the Middle East. Oil was, after all, the main reason the U.S. was drawn into the region decades ago.

But here's the catch: Cheap oil can destabilize Middle Eastern countries that depend almost entirely on oil revenue.

While combing through various Civil War files at the National Archives, a volunteer recently discovered a letter written by poet and essayist Walt Whitman on behalf of a Union soldier dying in a hospital far from home.

The National Archives is the repository of the nation's most important documents, including some they didn't even know they had, like said letter.

Washington, Jan. 21, 1865(6) My Dear Wife, You must excuse me for not having written to you before. I have not been very well + did not feel much like writing  but I feel considerably better now  my complaint is an affection of the lungs. I am mustered out of service, but am not at present well enough to come home. I hope you will try to write back as soon as you receive this + let me know how you all are, how things are going on  let me know how it is with mother. I write this by means of a friend who is now sitting by my side + I hope it will be God's will that we shall yet meet again. Well I send you all my love + must now close. Your affectionate husband,

Nelson Jabo Written by Walt Whitman

a friend.

The post-Civil War letter was discovered in February. Despite Whitman's claims to have written hundreds of letters for soldiers he would visit in hospitals, it is one of only three that researchers have been able to find with Whitman's name on it, says Jackie Budell, a specialist with the National Archives.

""He just literally visited people. And he bought stationery and he would bring it with him and he would offer to write letters home for them,"" she tells NPR's Michel Martin. ""Many [soldiers] were illiterate but also many were just too sickly to write so he would offer to do that.""

Whitman described his visits to wounded soldiers in an 1864 article in The New York Times.

Many sick and wounded soldiers have not written home to parents, brothers, sisters, and even wives, for one reason or another, for a long, long time. Some are poor writers, some cannot get paper and envelopes; many have an aversion to writing because they dread to worry the folks at home  the facts about them are so sad to tell. I always encourage the men to write, and promptly write for them.

""Hospitals during the Civil War were not a safe place to be, so it's really very admirable that he chose to be a volunteer in the hospitals,"" Budell says. Whitman had a government job but would frequently leave work early to visit the men.

""My custom is to go through a ward, or collection of wards, endeavoring to give some trifle to each, without missing any,"" Whitman writes in the Times. ""Even a sweet biscuit, a sheet of paper, or a passing word of friendliness, or but a look or nod, if no more.""

Whitman gave out fruit, candy or small amounts of change, Budell says. ""But I do think it was his investment of time and the emotion that he showed the boys that was probably what they were looking for the most.""

The newest discovery is believed to have been written in 1866, despite the 1865 date, according to The Washington Post.

Whitman was writing on behalf of Robert Nelson Jabo, a French Canadian who had been living in Clinton County, N.Y. The letter is addressed to Jabo's wife, who was named Adeline. The couple had six children at home, Budell says. Budo spent most of his time between 1861 and 1866 in the service, and died in 1866.

""I think Walt's time was the most important gift that he was giving these men,"" Budell says. ""Really they just needed someone to sit by their side.""

More of Whitman's diary entries from his time during the war are collected in the book Memoranda During the War. Whitman wants readers to remember (though maybe not too much) the ""lurid interiors"" and ""Hospital part of the drama""  those struggles of the Civil War apart from the dramatic outdoor battles.

Future years will never know the seething hell and the black infernal background of countless minor scenes and interiors, (not the few great battles) of the Secession War; and it is best they should not. In the mushy influences of current times the fervid atmosphere and typical events of those years are in danger of being totally forgotten.

""I'm sure many of [the soldiers] kind of knew what was about to happen to them,"" Budell says. ""And so they didn't want to worry family at home, but at the same time still wanted to give some parting thoughts to a wife or a mom who wondered where they were.""

Whitman's skill as a poet and writer also helped the men, who may not have been able to fully express themselves, Budell says. ""You can envision that he was, in effect, kind of helping them to verbalize maybe what they weren't able to say.""",[]

In the past, nearly every one of the program's graduates has scored a good job in the surging energy field. But not this year. As the price of oil has plummeted, companies are cutting back on production and expansion, and cutting into Marietta's placement rate.

She feels confident she'll come out of the program next year with a job, but in the current economy many of her classmates may not be so lucky. This spring, perhaps only 30 to 40 percent of graduates from the program will have jobs waiting.

Those of you in Hawaii, most of Arizona, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam and the Northern Marianas, go ahead and feel smug.

Everyone else: prepare to lose an hour tonight, as Daylight Saving Time begins and the clocks shift forward.

Daylight saving time means an extra hour of daylight in the evening, and darkness stretching a little further into the morning. The idea is that it makes daylight hours match up with the hours when people want to be active, and saves on energy use.

Whether daylight saving time achieves any of its aims is hotly disputed.

But it does mess with our circadian clocks  especially springing forward  and it certainly ticks people off.

Complaints about the change are as regular as, well, clockwork.

The Associated Press reported this week that some states are discussing joining the ranks of the daylight saving holdouts  while at least one state legislator is proposing switching over, and never switching back:

""California has a bill that would ask voters to abolish the practice of changing clocks twice a year. Lawmakers in Alaska and nearly a dozen other states are debating similar measures. Some lawmakers in New England want to go even further, seceding from the populous Eastern Time Zone and throwing their lot in with Nova Scotia and Puerto Rico.

'Pretty much everyone I speak to would rather have it light in the evening than light first thing in the morning,' he said. ...

The Seer: A Portrait of Wendell Berry, a documentary premiering today at the SXSW Interactive Festival in Austin, conveys the joys of living in a rural American community and, also, the hellish changes to that manner of life wrought by massive industrialization.

The film takes place in Henry County, Ky., where writer and activist Wendell Berry's family has farmed the land for 200 years.

Directed by Laura Dunn, the movie isn't afraid to look at farms and farmers with emotion  one thing that drew me to it. (I screened the film at home, not in Austin.) Dunn interviews Berry, his wife Tanya and daughter Mary, and others  like organic farmer Steve Smith. Collectively, their words sear.

""A little nowhere place,"" Berry says, that's what these small rural towns are called now. Rural folks know all too well the prevailing sentiment in the country at large that, as Mary puts it: ""If you were smarter, you'd do something besides farming.""

And, of course, more of us than ever before are doing something besides farming: Once 45 percent agrarian, the U.S. is now only 4 percent agrarian. As Berry wrote in his now classic, non-fiction book The Unsettling of America, first published in 1977  and as is heard again in the film  the decline in farming over time is tied to agribusiness. The expensive materials that make farming more efficient, all the technology and all the chemicals, cost so much that more acres have to be planted, and then those acres have to be farmed more efficiently, and so it goes, around and around.

Tanya, in a perfect on-screen evocation of Wendell Berry's theme through his decades of writing and environmental activism, says that what has to come back into our consciousness is this: that it's possible to live a decent life on a farm without being industrialized.

Central to The Seer is something else that faithfully reflects Berry's writing and activism: an acute sense of place, the sense that the land, this particular beloved Kentucky land, makes possible the story. It's not, Berry clarifies, that this land offers up subject matter; the connection goes deeper than that.

""The place is precedent to my work,"" he says. And in the film, the scenes we see  a quiet natural world or people at work on the land  allow us to see also what he intends by that statement.

Seeing nature, as the film's title suggests, is all-important for Berry. Mary remembers that, growing up, she was told always ""to look and see"" by her parents: What is beautiful and right? What is ugly and needs fixing?

That same vision is present, too, in Berry's fiction, the genre of his writing that I know best. His Port William novels (Port William stands in for Henry County) feature farmers Old Jack Beechum and younger Andy Catlett and their kin and friends who live out their love of the land and lament the losses that industrial-scale modernization brings.

In The Memory of Old Jack, the deep bond between a farmer and land weaves itself into every page:

""The work satisfied something deeper in him than his own desire. It was as if he went to his fields in the spring, not just because he wanted to, but because his father and grandfather before him had gone because they wanted to  because, since the first seeds were planted by hand in the ground, his kinsmen had gone each spring to the fields.""

Time's fluidity is ever-present in these novels. With many generations of family and other loved ones working the land, the old teach the young who teach the old, and the past doesn't vanish but lingers. In Remembering, as Andy Catlett approaches Port William after being away in San Francisco, Berry writes:

""In the river valley Andy takes the slower Port William road, and the pick-up begins to move with a different motion, approaching the shape of the country....And Andy's body begins to live again in the familiar sways and pressures of his approach to home. His own place becomes palpable to him. Those he loves, living and dead, are no longer mere thoughts or memories, but presences, approachable and near.""

Yet that connection Andy feels can forcibly be altered by cultural shifts and right there, at the heart of that sad knowledge, is, I believe, the strongest intersection between Berry's non-fiction and fiction, between his writing and his life.

The film does inspire hope. Local food movements and farmers' markets, the Berrys say, are a good start  but not enough because changes in how food is sold and consumed must be linked to land use. Good farms can, and do, exist. As Berry told Modern Farmer last year:

""The responsible farmer would not own more land than he or she could know well and pay close attention to and care for properly...A good farm is recognized as good partly by its beauty: the presence of trees, grass, good livestock on the pastures.""

I think not of ""livestock"" in any generic sense but of individual cows, pigs and chickens kept on small farms out of crowded conditions, gestation crates or battery boxes. And, yes, I know that the very mention of farming that may involve animal slaughter kicks us into turbulent waters, because as this column by Bruce Friedrich, now executive director of The Good Food Institute, shows, serious conversation exists about whether ""humane meat"" is ever really possible.

Wendell Berry asks us to remember farming families and farming communities as we discuss these hard issues. The Seer opens up a space  a visually beautiful space  to talk about the land and all of us who live on it and off it.

i toggle caption Eric Gay/AP Eric Gay/AP

The U.S. has ramped up oil production so dramatically that it's joined Saudi Arabia and Russia as one of the world's largest producers. Just glance at the chart below.

Since this surge began in 2008, American production rocketed from 5 million barrels a day to nearly 10 million barrels a day at the high point last year.

More importantly, oil analysts confidently predicted that a tide of benefits would flow as freely as the oil now coming out of the ground.

First, the U.S. economy would get a boost that would include a renaissance in manufacturing. Second, the U.S. would be far less dependent on the vagaries of foreign energy producers. And third, America could shrink its footprint in the volatile Middle East.

Yet none of this has happened. Why not?

Forecast No. 1: An Economic Boost



The boom, fueled by shale oil fields in places like North Dakota, was supposed to turbo-charge the economy. Energy would be abundant and cheap. Consumers would have more money to spend on other stuff.

And that's all true. You see it in places like convenience stores. When it costs drivers less to fill up the tank, they buy more soda. Good for Coke. Good for Pepsi.

But many forecasters failed to see the other side of the equation. More American companies and workers are now linked directly or indirectly to the oil industry, and they get hurt when prices go down.

""Actually, oil has become more important to the U.S. economy because of this almost doubling of U.S. oil production,"" said Daniel Yergin, the author of best-selling books on the industry, including The Prize and The Quest.

Americans used to worry only about high oil prices, he noted. But now the country needs to consider what happens when prices go down.

""You have people working all across the United States that are in effect part of the supply chains. So when the oil price goes down, and companies cut spending, this reverberates in Illinois, Ohio and many other states,"" said Yergin, who is vice chairman of the economics firm IHS.

The U.S. economy has grown steadily since the 2008-2009 recession. But that growth has been modest compared to previous recoveries. Since oil prices crashed in the summer of 2014, going from more than $100 a barrel to around $30 today, the economy has continued at roughly the same pace.

So what's the overall impact of cheap oil? Yergin describes it as a ""titter-totter."" Some gains here, some losses there, but overall, pretty neutral.

Forecast No. 2: Energy Independence



U.S. imports have dropped dramatically, but this really hasn't set the U.S. free in the ways anticipated.

All this new American oil contributes to the current worldwide glut and the low prices. And neither the U.S. nor any other country wants to be the one that cuts back and sacrifices its own production for the greater good.

""Someone has to cry uncle,"" says oil analyst Steve LeVine, who writes for Quartz and teaches at Georgetown University. ""The conventional wisdom is that American shale oil producers will be the ones. And they are in trouble.""

The reason is cost. Saudi Arabia and other low-cost producers still make a profit when oil is $30 a barrel. Much of the U.S. production is relatively high-cost, and many companies are losing money at the current price.

Every day, world production of oil exceeds demand by more than 1 million barrels. Many countries are running low on places to store the excess.

In the U.S., that place is Cushing, Oklahoma, home of huge and rapidly filling storage tanks, LeVine says.

Some 500 million barrels of oil are in storage around the world, says LeVine.

""That's the largest volume in storage since the Great Depression,"" he notes, adding that some forecasters are predicting that if storage runs out, oil could go below $20 a barrel.

Forecast No. 3: U.S. Pulls Back In The Middle East



Forecasters also argued that more U.S. oil would mean a reduced American need to resolve conflicts in the Middle East. Oil was, after all, the main reason the U.S. was drawn into the region decades ago.

But here's the catch: Cheap oil can destabilize Middle Eastern countries that depend almost entirely on oil revenue.

Consider Iraq. It's desperately short of cash as it fights the Islamic State and tries to stay current on salaries to millions of government workers.

President Obama pledged to end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and he has withdrawn the large contingents of U.S. large ground forces. Yet in Obama's final year in office, the U.S. is still engaged in three regional wars  Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria  and dealing with instability throughout the region.

All the forecasts looked at the potential upside of more American oil, but never fully factored in the downside.

While combing through various Civil War files at the National Archives, a volunteer recently discovered a letter written by poet and essayist Walt Whitman on behalf of a Union soldier dying in a hospital far from home.

The National Archives is the repository of the nation's most important documents, including some they didn't even know they had, like said letter.

Washington, Jan. 21, 1865(6) My Dear Wife, You must excuse me for not having written to you before. I have not been very well + did not feel much like writing  but I feel considerably better now  my complaint is an affection of the lungs. I am mustered out of service, but am not at present well enough to come home. I hope you will try to write back as soon as you receive this + let me know how you all are, how things are going on  let me know how it is with mother. I write this by means of a friend who is now sitting by my side + I hope it will be God's will that we shall yet meet again. Well I send you all my love + must now close. Your affectionate husband,

Nelson Jabo Written by Walt Whitman

a friend.

The post-Civil War letter was discovered in February. Despite Whitman's claims to have written hundreds of letters for soldiers he would visit in hospitals, it is one of only three that researchers have been able to find with Whitman's name on it, says Jackie Budell, a specialist with the National Archives.

""He just literally visited people. And he bought stationery and he would bring it with him and he would offer to write letters home for them,"" she tells NPR's Michel Martin. ""Many [soldiers] were illiterate but also many were just too sickly to write so he would offer to do that.""

Whitman described his visits to wounded soldiers in an 1864 article in The New York Times.

Many sick and wounded soldiers have not written home to parents, brothers, sisters, and even wives, for one reason or another, for a long, long time. Some are poor writers, some cannot get paper and envelopes; many have an aversion to writing because they dread to worry the folks at home  the facts about them are so sad to tell. I always encourage the men to write, and promptly write for them.

""Hospitals during the Civil War were not a safe place to be, so it's really very admirable that he chose to be a volunteer in the hospitals,"" Budell says. Whitman had a government job but would frequently leave work early to visit the men.

""My custom is to go through a ward, or collection of wards, endeavoring to give some trifle to each, without missing any,"" Whitman writes in the Times. ""Even a sweet biscuit, a sheet of paper, or a passing word of friendliness, or but a look or nod, if no more.""

Whitman gave out fruit, candy or small amounts of change, Budell says. ""But I do think it was his investment of time and the emotion that he showed the boys that was probably what they were looking for the most.""

The newest discovery is believed to have been written in 1866, despite the 1865 date, according to The Washington Post.

Whitman was writing on behalf of Robert Nelson Jabo, a French Canadian who had been living in Clinton County, N.Y. The letter is addressed to Jabo's wife, who was named Adeline. The couple had six children at home, Budell says. Budo spent most of his time between 1861 and 1866 in the service, and died in 1866.

""I think Walt's time was the most important gift that he was giving these men,"" Budell says. ""Really they just needed someone to sit by their side.""

More of Whitman's diary entries from his time during the war are collected in the book Memoranda During the War. Whitman wants readers to remember (though maybe not too much) the ""lurid interiors"" and ""Hospital part of the drama""  those struggles of the Civil War apart from the dramatic outdoor battles.

Future years will never know the seething hell and the black infernal background of countless minor scenes and interiors, (not the few great battles) of the Secession War; and it is best they should not. In the mushy influences of current times the fervid atmosphere and typical events of those years are in danger of being totally forgotten.

""I'm sure many of [the soldiers] kind of knew what was about to happen to them,"" Budell says. ""And so they didn't want to worry family at home, but at the same time still wanted to give some parting thoughts to a wife or a mom who wondered where they were.""

Whitman's skill as a poet and writer also helped the men, who may not have been able to fully express themselves, Budell says. ""You can envision that he was, in effect, kind of helping them to verbalize maybe what they weren't able to say.""",[]

Rachel Martin speaks with Chris Bachelder. His novel tells the story of a group of friends who gather each year to re-enact the gruesome injury sustain by quarterback Joe Theisman.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Football fans of a certain age can still recall with horror a particular moment during a ""Monday Night Football"" game in 1985. Washington quarterback Joe Theismann ran a play called the flea flicker, and it left him wide open to the hard-charging linebacker of the New York Giants, Lawrence Taylor.

(SOUNDBITE OF ""MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL"")

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And it was Lawrence Taylor who slammed Theismann to the ground at the 42-yard line. The blitz was on. That's not necessarily a good play to have called. And quickly, Lawrence Taylor is up saying Theismann is hurt.

MARTIN: Yeah. Theismann was really hurt. His right leg snapped in two. His football career ended that night. This moment frozen in sports history is at the heart of a new novel by Chris Bachelder. It's called ""The Throwback Special,"" and it's a surprisingly funny and poignant story about a group of friends who reunite every year to re-enact that play and then reflect on their middle-aged lives in the process. Chris Bachelder joins us from member station WVXU in Cincinnati.

Chris, welcome to the program.

CHRIS BACHELDER: Thank you. It's my pleasure.

MARTIN: When did you first see this football play happen? Were you old enough to have watched it when it actually occurred (laughter)?

BACHELDER: Yes, I was. I was 14, I think, in 1985.

MARTIN: Yeah.

BACHELDER: And those games were on at 9, and I usually watched at least the first half and this happened early in the second quarter, so I saw it.

MARTIN: So I hadn't seen it. And so I had to go watch it, you know, in preparation for having this conversation with you. And I don't know if it was just the clip I found on YouTube, but the - at the first look at it, just the camera angle, didn't show it. You know, you just see Lawrence Taylor, L.T., like, holding his helmet, and clearly, he's upset and something bad has transpired. And then they're, like, let's go to the reverse angle cam and then they play it again. This is horrible.

BACHELDER: It's awful, and I'm sorry to introduce you to it. But it's - yeah, it's just awful.

MARTIN: So this clearly stayed with you for many years. How in the world did you come up with this conceit to use this event as the fulcrum around which to build a novel about these guys?

BACHELDER: You know, it was a kind of slow and gradual process. I think I originally thought the power was in the play itself. And there's plenty of power there, but the kind of literary power or energy that I was feeling had to do more with that play plus time - plus 25 or 30 years. So when you bring nostalgia into the mix - when you bring a sort of middle-aged man into the mix, reflecting on the play, you have two times existing together. The play was my context, not my subject.

MARTIN: These guys - these characters in your book help us set the scene. Every year they get together in his hotel - it's the same hotel every year?

BACHELDER: Yeah.

MARTIN: They bring their own football gear. How do they decide who gets to play what character in this re-enactment?

BACHELDER: Yeah. So they gather for a weekend every November around the date of the anniversary and - in a two-and-a-half star chain hotel. And they spend a weekend, and they have very complicated rituals and traditions. And there's a lottery system with Ping-Pong balls with their names on them in which they draw - when your name is drawn, you get to choose which player you are, but there are complicated subrules.

MARTIN: All kinds of rules. You can't be - you can't have the main role two years in a row? Tell me what the rules are.

BACHELDER: I think so - I (laughter).

MARTIN: You can't remember.

BACHELDER: Of course I can't.

MARTIN: (Laughter).

BACHELDER: They're very complicated, these men's rules. But you - I do know the last person to draw is automatically Theismann, so you don't get to choose to be Theismann.

MARTIN: OK.

BACHELDER: And Lawrence Taylor is generally chosen among the first, whether the man wants to be Lawrence Taylor or not. He feels sort of a pressure, I think, to be the hero - or the antihero of the drama.

MARTIN: Who are they? They all seem to have some kind of low-grade disappointment in their lives when they come together. Or is it just bringing them all together brings that out in their conversation? Tell me a little bit about where they're at in their lives.

BACHELDER: Yeah. I think they're just men of a certain age, probably mid-40s, and they've reached a point in their lives when they see what their lives are going to become for better or worse. And I think they've also reached a point where they understand they don't have as much control over their lives as they thought. I think if the play means anything, one of the things it means is that - is the awful contingency and chaos and the sort of dark, catastrophic potential underneath our plans. So I think the men take a certain pleasure - and this might be a religious impulse in some sense - but they take a certain pleasure in perfecting and controlling this play, the very meaning of which is that you can't control, right, or perfect anything. And in that way, they're - it's sort of primitively religious, I think.

MARTIN: It seems that some of their angst - for some of them - comes from parenting. One dad is worried that his young daughter - I think it was - took a fall and he wasn't worried enough about her because he kind of thought she deserved it maybe. Another guy is a bit freaked out because he fantasizes about the adult female characters in the children's books he reads to his kids.

(LAUGHTER)

BACHELDER: You're making this sound more disturbing somehow.

MARTIN: I know, but there's something real about these things that they share with one another. This is a sacred place where they might not be able to divulge this stuff in their regular life. But they get together in this two-star hotel room under the auspices of reliving these rituals and all of a sudden, these men get to just be human.

BACHELDER: Right. And I would think sacred's a great word. There is something sacred about the gathering at the risk of making it sound too grand. I think the men have to fool themselves. They're not going to say - let's all get together, you know. They're not going to say - let's have a spa weekend, or let's have a time to talk together (laughter). So they, in a sense, have fooled themselves. They're coming for the play, they think. But then the thing that they're really doing is, as you say, sharing confidences, sharing anxieties, sharing disappointments and fears.

MARTIN: Yeah.

BACHELDER: But it's almost as if they don't quite know the real reasons why they do this.

MARTIN: What happens to these guys when they go home from this gathering every year? How does this change them, do you think, in their regular lives?

BACHELDER: I think they look forward to it. But I think when they go home, it's back to their normal lives. And I think, to some extent, they don't understand their own contentment. I don't think that their lives are that horrible. They're just coming to terms with what it means to come into middle age.

MARTIN: Just life - you're telling me this is just about all of us kind of just growing up.

BACHELDER: (Laughter) Yeah, you know, I mean, the idea of making a plan - a play - and having the play go wrong is really analogous to parenting, to writing (laughter), to a lot of the things we do.

MARTIN: Chris Bachelder - his new novel is called ""The Throwback Special.""

Chris, thanks so much for talking with us.

More than a dozen people in Ivory Coast have been killed in an attack on a several popular beach hotels on Sunday.

Six armed militants targeted beach-goers and hotel guests in Grand-Bassam, a historic resort town located about 25 miles east of Abdijan, Ivory Coast.

The gunmen killed 14 people, according to Ivory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara; he says the six militants have also been killed. Ouattara is visiting the sites of the shootings to express his condolences.

The hotels in Grand-Bassam are frequented by both locals and foreign tourists, NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton says.

""Witnesses describe heavily-armed gunmen shooting guests on the beach, before opening fire on nearby hotels,"" Ofeibea tells our Newscast unit.

She says Ivory Coast is currently experiencing a heat wave, driving visitors to the tourist destination.

The militant Islamist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, has claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the SITE intelligence group.

The capitals of nearby Mali and Burkina Faso have recently been struck by similar attacks on upscale hotels, which were also claimed by AQIM.

A hotel in Bamako, Mali, was attacked in November and more than 170 guests were taken hostage, with more than 20 fatalities. A hotel in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, was stormed in January; 126 people were taken hostage and about 20 people killed. Both hotels were popular with Westerners.

AQIM claimed joint responsibility for the Mali attack and sole responsibility for the Burkina Faso attack. This is the third attack in West Africa since October for which AQIM has claimed responsibility.

Keith Emerson whose keyboard work helped usher in the age of progressive rock music has died at the age of 71. He was a founding member of the band Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Police say his death appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The supergroup was formed in 1970 when Emerson got together with former King Crimson guitarist Greg Lake and drummer Carl Palmer who'd been with the band The Crazy World of Arthur Brown.

ELP disbanded and reformed a number of times over the years. Their last time playing together was at a festival in London in 2010. Throughout their career, it was Keith Emerson's passionate keyboard work that defined the band's sound. Drummer Carl Palmer said in a statement he was a pioneer and an innovator whose music genius touched all of us in the world of rock, classical and jazz.

Bernie Sanders was able to win in Michigan, upsetting Hillary Clinton, with the support of white men. (NPR's Tamara Keith laid that out in this post this morning). Sanders won 62% of white men in the Michigan Democratic primary, while Clinton won 68% of black voters. That is a big share, but wasn't enough  and certainly smaller than the margins she's gotten among black voters in Southern states.

Looking at that difference, between white men and black voters, the chart shows where Sanders and Clinton might have their best shots in states going forward with significant delegate hauls. This analysis is based on 2008 exit polls and takes the difference between what white men were as a share of the electorate as compared to black voters.

-Hispanics were not factored into this analysis, and they will certainly make a difference in California, Arizona and Florida.

On a recent episode of The Bachelor, the ABC dating reality show that ends its twentieth season Monday night, contestant Caila Quinn brings Ben Higgins home to meet her interracial family.

""Have you ever met Filipinos before?"" Quinn's mother asks, leading Higgins into a dining room where the table is filled with traditional Filipino food.

""I don't know,"" he replies. ""No. I don't think so.""

As they sit around the adobo and pancit, Quinn's father talks to Higgins, white man to white man. What comes with dating Quinn, the father says, ""is a very special Philippine community."" Quinn grimaces.

""I had no idea what I was getting into when I married Caila's mother,"" the father says. But being married to a Filipina, he assures Higgins, has been ""the most fun"" and ""magical.""

This scene can be read as an attempt by The Bachelor franchise to dispel criticisms (and the memory of a 2012 lawsuit) concerning its whitewashed casts. It shows how these attempts can be clunky at best, offensive and creepy at worst.

Quinn's run also demonstrates how, as this rose-strewn, fantasy-fueled romance machine tries to include more people of color, diversification looks like biracial Asian American women.

Among the 19 women who have won the ""final rose"" since The Bachelor premiered in 2002, two  Tessa Horst and Catherine Giudici  have been biracial Asian-white. All other winners, aside from Mary Delgado in 2004 who was Cuban American, appear to have been white. As these handy graphics by writer and video artist Karen X. Cheng show, in the previous seven years, the only women of color who lasted into the final few weeks were of mixed-race Asian-white background.

Other women of color on The Bachelor tend to follow a familiar pattern: they may face hostility and racial anxieties from other contestants, then disappear from the screen early in the season. The latest example is Jubilee Sharpe, this season's black military veteran who fielded microaggressions from other contestants and suffered tension with the two biracial African-American and white women. On the show, these conflicts were coded with euphemisms: Sharpe was ""layered"" and ""complicated"" and ""different."" Sharpe stuck around longer than most black women, but was still eliminated within the first half of the season.

Now, ABC executives have hinted that the next woman to lead the spin-off show The Bachelorette will be  for the first time  a woman of color. Who is the rumored lucky lady? Caila Quinn, whose father tried and failed to sell Higgins on the advantages of Filipina wives this season. Anointing her as the first bachelorette of color would be a safe, predictable choice for the franchise. Producers could hold Quinn up as proof the shows are changing, while continuing to reflect and reinforce racial stereotypes.

To understand why only a narrow group of women of color  biracial Asian-white women  survive in this world is to delve into romantic tropes, the stuff The Bachelor is made of.

""As objects of beauty, these women are benefiting from two helpful stereotypes about female desirability,"" said Ann Morning, associate professor of Sociology at New York University. One is whiteness as the persisting standard of beauty. The other is Asian women as sexualized, exotic, and submissive.

Taken alone, the first stereotype can be detrimental. ""Today, being white is often perceived as a kind of boring, colorless identity,"" Morning said. But that stereotype about whiteness can work to balance negative stereotypes about Asian women.

Lily Anne Welty Tamai, curator of history at the Japanese American National Museum (and a friend of mine), explained where these stereotypes about Asian women come from. The trope of Puccini's 1904 Madama Butterfly paved the way for American incarnations of a tragic love story between an American soldier and Asian woman in the mid-twentieth century, when American soldiers brought home war stories  and sometimes brides  from Asia, where women were often part of the conquest. Popular narratives included the 1957 film Sayonara and the 1989 musical Miss Saigon. (""I guess they just never got around to making the Korea version,"" Tamai said.)

If this show was called 'The Hook Up,' and contestants were having one-night stands, we'd see more racially diverse pools of people.""

These stories cemented in the American consciousness the idea of the Asian woman as the foreign sex toy: the geisha, the china doll, the ""Me love you long time"" sex worker.

""Asian American women today still experience the wrath of those legacies every day,"" said Joanne Rondilla, a lecturer of Asian Pacific American Studies at Arizona State University. Rondilla pointed to the Creepy White Guys tumblr that collected offensive messages sent to Asian American women via online dating platforms. In a similar vein, last year Mia Matsumiya created an Instagram account to post the thousand-plus ""messages from creeps, weirdos & fetishists"" she's received over the past decade. My personal favorite calling out of these dating dynamics is comedian Kristina Wong's incredible I'm Asian American and... episode in which she collects ""reparations for yellow fever"" on dates with white men.

On The Bachelor, producers exercised these stereotypes about Asian American women the last time they cast a single-race Asian American woman. In 2010, contestant Channy Choch was introduced to viewers and bachelor Jake Pavelka with her inviting him to have sex with her in Cambodian. Later, she laughingly spoke to the camera about how Pavelka ""needs a little bit of Cambodian fever.""

""All her moments on screen highlight her Cambodian heritage and her sexual desiresusually both at once, drawing a link between these,"" Rachel Dubrofsky told me by email. Dubrofsky, associate professor of Communication at the University of South Florida, wrote a book analyzing The Bachelor franchise, and found that women of color only win the prize of a proposal when their ""racial difference is treated as not only unimportant, but as non-existent.""

What's exciting on Tinder, the show communicates, becomes unacceptable when matrimony is involved. ""If this show was called The Hook Up, and contestants were having one-night stands, we'd see more racially diverse pools of people,"" Morning said.

Mixed-race Asian-white women become the perfect vehicles for diversity on this show because they are ""white enough to present to the family,"" as Morning said, while still being exotic enough to fill a quota. Morning suggested they also get a boost from the model minority myth and the recent idea that being multiracial is ""cool.""

Until this season's Quinn family dinner scene, the ethnic identities of hapa women have been largely unremarked upon onscreen. Instead, only a vague, alluring, comfortable kind of distinction might be mentioned. ""She was different,"" bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis said of contestant Sharleen Joynt, a Chinese-Canadian opera singer from season 18. ""She was elegant, and I was like, surprised. She was so classy. And she's sexy.""

Outside the final media product presented by makers of the show, more explicit exotification can happen. In 2007, bachelor Andy Baldwin chose Tessa Horst as his final pick. Throughout the season, Horst's Chinese-white background is never mentioned and, as Dubrofsky noted, ""is only briefly apparent during the hometown date where her [Asian] mom appears.... Her mom, however, barely speaks, and is mostly seen in the background.""

Only after the season had ended did we glimpse how Horst's race might have played into her relationship with Baldwin. At a press conference in Waikiki, Baldwin said of his choice, ""I always say the mutts are the most exotic and beautiful.""

This is the kind of comment mixed-race Asian American women contend with outside the sanitized space of The Bachelor. ""We're exotified for being mixed,"" said Athena Mari Asklipiadis, a board member at Multiracial Americans of Southern California. ""If a man has an Asian fetish, he'll play that up in what he sees in me."" She said fetishization also can come from Asian American men who see her whiteness as exotic.

If Caila Quinn is cast as the first bachelorette of color, producers will probably continue to omit thornier realities. Her casting could represent some form of progress, though, if producers continue to highlight her Filipina heritage, however awkwardly. Portraying an Asian American woman as the ultimate marriage material  and not as a sexualized joke  could signal a step toward better humanizing people of color in this space. But it also could be just another spin on the ""model minority"" myth.

And there's the question of how diverse her suitors would be. A bachelorette of color presents a dilemma for producers: either an interracial romance  still controversial to some viewers  or a relationship in which neither person is white (who will the white audience relate to?).

Myra Washington, assistant professor of Communication at the University of New Mexico, predicted an increase in black contestants if Quinn becomes the bachelorette. ""Not Wesley Snipes-black, because this is still TV,"" she said. She guessed there would be more mixed-race African-Americans, brown-skinned men, Latinos. But colonial legacies and systems of power die hard. ""I think she'll ultimately end up with a white dude,"" she said.

There is a righteous, deep-felt fury I sometimes experience when reading stupendously good work. How dare you, I shout at the author, dropping the book, pacing for a while, how dare you make me feel so much. I rant on Twitter. I joke about how the author must be stopped.

I have done all those things elsewhere and am left hollowed out. Ken Liu's The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories is a book from which I staggered away, dazed, unable to speak. I have wrestled with how to review it, circled my metaphors like a wary cat, and finally abandoned the enterprise of trying to live up to its accomplishment. I will be honest, and blunt, because this is a book that has scoured me of language and insight and left itself rattling around inside the shell of me.

I have never been so moved by a collection of short fiction. I was at times afraid to read more. Every single story struck chords in me profound enough to hurt, whether about the love and cruelty of families; the melancholy of thermodynamics; the vicious unfairness of history and the humbling grace with which people endure its weight. Stories so often take us out of ourselves; Liu's stories went deep into my marrow, laying bare painful truths, meticulously slicing through the layers of pearl to find the grain of sand at its heart.

I'd read some of these pieces when they made their first appearances in magazines: the much-lauded ""The Paper Menagerie"" in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, ""Good Hunting"" in two parts on Strange Horizons. Liu's stories always impressed me; so did his novel, The Grace of Kings. But this collection is so much more than the sum of its parts that the phrase loses all meaning. Selected from more than seventy stories published over the course of twelve years, these fifteen are strands of silk woven into a spider's web, or precise folds compressing an enormous decade-spanning oeuvre into something one can hold with two hands.

I have never been so moved by a collection of short fiction. I was at times afraid to read more.

In ""State Change"" a girl is born with an ice cube for a soul, and lives her life trying to keep it from melting. In ""The Regular,"" a private detective hunts a serial killer while wrestling with her private grief and the toll it has taken on her mechanically enhanced body. In ""All the Flavours"" a little girl in 1870s Idaho meets a man who might be the red-faced god of war, and listens to his stories. The final story  appropriately named ""The Man Who Ended History: A Documentary""  is a harrowing meditation on nations, memory, responsibility, and to whom the past can rightly be said to belong.

""For me,"" says Liu in his preface to the collection, ""all fiction is about prizing the logic of metaphors  which is the logic of narratives in general  over reality, which is irreducibly random and senseless."" This is the organizing principle of The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories, the one that drives me to grasp at pearls, and silk, and paper folds in an attempt to convey my experience of reading it. I almost want to review the preface alone. It is simultaneously a statement of purpose, a map, and a key.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge, writing in his Notebooks, once asked and answered the following question:

Why do you make a book? Because my Hands can extend but a few score Inches from my Body ... but think only of the thoughts, feelings, radical Impulse that have been implanted in how many thousands of thousands by the little Ballad of the Children in the Wood! The Sphere of Alexander the great's Agency is trifling compared with it.

Cutting across history and biology, physics and folk tales, why do you make a book is the question at the heart of this work, inseparable from what is a book and how is a book. Storytelling  whether in oral or written tradition, along family or national lines, private musing or public record  is the means of digesting, communicating, understanding histories and experiences too vast to encompass.

Whether in a letter written from a mother to her son, an alien history scratched on the surface of an irradiated planet, or myths of origin transforming to keep up with humanity's phase-shifting, stories are the language we speak to each other. In A Paper Menagerie and Other Stories, Liu speaks it with devastating eloquence.

When most people want to play a game, the first thing they reach for is likely a smartphone or tablet. Actual pinball machines have become quaint curiosities, but a father-son duo in California is keeping these old-school games alive in a museum.

The Museum of Pinball is hidden away in an old industrial building, just off Interstate 10 and about 90 miles east of Los Angeles in Banning, Calif. It's pretty quiet when the rows upon rows of pinball machines are not turned on. But once the switch is flipped, it gets loud.

""I built this collection picking them up one by one, and I put them in my house,"" says John Weeks, who founded the museum together with his son, Johnathan Weeks. ""I'd fill up buildings with them, storage units.""

Their collection is huge. There are 650 games ranging from vintage 1950s-era machines all the way up to ones based on current TV shows such as The Walking Dead. John began amassing the games in the early 1980s.

At first, he thought of opening a bar with an arcade, but that would only allow a handful of the collection to be played at any given time. The benefit of the museum is that all the machines are out on display. But Johnathan explains there is a drawback.

""You gotta remember when the museum is so large and there's so many games plugged in,"" he says. ""Just to flip the breakers is thousands of dollars to turn it on for the day.""

That means the museum is only open a few times a year. During a recent rare opening, Dolores Barrett was trying her hand at it.

""I've really never played pinball. But I started out by playing The Terminator, and now I'm hooked,"" she says.

Although she's old enough to have grown up with pinball, Barrett says her parents never let her have a quarter to play as a kid. Now, she's making up for lost time.

On a different aisle of old timey machines, Jamie Vanderet is playing one called Sea Ray. He's here from Ottawa and says he picked up the game at a bar back in Canada.

""Once you start to play, you kind of get the bug,"" he says.

When he was a kid, pinball and arcades were already starting to fade. He says it's not nostalgia drawing him to the games.

""There's just something about like the lights and colors, especially with the older machines,"" he says.

Vanderet thinks it has something to do with the physicality of the real machines.

""I have played versions on the iPad and on the computer and stuff, it's not nearly the same thing as playing it in the flesh. I mean, the machines all have their own quirks that you don't really get into when you're playing a digital version,"" he says. ""It doesn't quite match. Not even close.""

Quietly tapping a screen is one way to play a game, but as Barrett discovers, shouting and celebrating with each click of the flipper and bounce of the pinball  surrounded by audience  is more fun.

""Oh my goodness, I'm doing this. I can't believe it. I can't believe this!"" Barrett says.",[]

npr.org,2016-03-13 00:00:00,New Study On Malnutrition Emphasizes That Protein Is Critical For A Child's Development,[],"The Strange And Surprising Debate Over How To Help A Malnourished Kid

i Elizabeth Maidl/courtesy of Washington University at St. Louis Elizabeth Maidl/courtesy of Washington University at St. Louis

It used to be common knowledge: Malnourished kids need more protein to thrive. Then came a scathing paper in the Lancet in 1974 called ""The Great Protein Fiasco."" Filled with sarcasm, it argued that the nutrition community's fixation on protein was a waste of time and money.

""There is mounting recognition that the emphasis which has been given to the role of protein in human undernutrition, resulting in the claim that there is a global protein 'gap,' 'crisis,' or 'problem,' is wrong,"" wrote author Donald McLaren, then a clinical nutrition professor at the American University's School of Medicine in Beirut.

The paper hit the field hard, says Richard Semba, an expert on health and nutrition in developing countries, who is based at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. Protein researchers weren't even invited to the next world food conference. And for the following decades, malnutrition researchers focused on vitamins, minerals and calories.

It may be time for another pendulum shift, suggest Semba's latest findings. For a study published last month, he and colleagues visited rural villages in southern Malawi, where they found that chronically malnourished young children were low in all essential amino acids.

Vitamins remain essential, he says. But the new results, along with other accumulating evidence, suggest that protein needs to be a bigger part of the picture.

""It's not just micronutrients that are going to save the world,"" Semba says. ""I think we're going to see a sea change in the international nutritional community.""

The rural villagers whom he studied in Malawi take meticulous care of their thatched-roof mud huts. But without electricity or running water in many places, kids suffer high rates of diarrhea and other illnesses.

With eggs as a once-a-month luxury, along with low-nutrient corn porridge as the major source of solid food for babies, the result is widespread chronic malnutrition and stunting. This condition, in which kids are very short for their age, sets children up for a lifetime's worth of problems.

Although the global nutrition community rejected the importance of protein in the 1970s, micronutrient supplements alone have failed to make a dent in chronic malnutrition among children. Meanwhile, researchers have increasingly acknowledged the cascade of negative consequences that come from lack of adequate nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life.

Chronic malnutrition is particularly insidious, says Martin Bloem, chief nutritionist at the U.N. World Food Programme, who also teaches at Johns Hopkins but was not affiliated with the new study. Unlike kids with severe acute malnutrition, who are often extremely skinny and bloated, kids with chronic malnutrition can be normally proportioned but stunted.

And while being short may not seem like a big deal, failure to grow in height in the first couple years of life is a sign that the brain and organs are also not developing sufficiently. Later in life, stunting has been linked to higher risks for obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases.

As many as 40 percent of children are stunted in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, Bloem says. Globally, a quarter of all kids under age 5 are too short for their age.

With evidence growing over the last few years that it's time to revive the protein trail, Semba and colleagues measured the heights of 313 rural Malawian kids between the ages of 1 and 5. They also took blood samples.

More than 60 percent of the kids were stunted, the researchers reported in EBioMedicine. And, compared to taller children, blood levels of all essential amino acids in stunted kids were 15 to 20 percent lower, suggesting that those kids are consuming significantly less protein. ""It was more striking than we expected,"" Semba says.

The team is now analyzing links between stunting and socioeconomics. In a region where owning a bicycle is a major status symbol, Semba suspects that families with even slightly more money are able to feed animal proteins to their kids more often. Hygiene may also play a role. Frequent bouts of diarrhea can deprive kids of the nutrients they need to grow well.

""The findings of the new study are very important because they show that amino acids play a key role in this problem,"" Bloem says, adding that the World Food Programme delivers food to 100 million people a year in the most difficult circumstances. ""It's always a big discussion for us about what is the optimal food.""

Cost remains a major barrier. Meat, milk and fish contain all the most important amino acids, but animal products are expensive. For its part, the World Food Programme is working with the Clinton Health Initiative in Rwanda to create a baby cereal fortified with essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids.

The new study also emphasizes the need to revise recommended protein requirements for kids in challenging environments, says Ricardo Uauy, a nutritional biochemist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the University of Chile, who was not involved in the new research.

Frequent illnesses and other stresses increase the amount of protein that children need to grow to their full potential, Uauy says. Inflammation of the gut after regular bouts of diarrhea, for example, reduces the body's ability to absorb nutrients and can increase protein needs by between 30 and 50 percent.

Marietta College has earned a global reputation for its program in petroleum engineering, drawing students from as far away as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and China to this liberal arts school in southeast Ohio.

In the past, nearly every one of the program's graduates has scored a good job in the surging energy field. But not this year. As the price of oil has plummeted, companies are cutting back on production and expansion, and cutting into Marietta's placement rate.

Katie Plas, scheduled to graduate in 2017, thinks she'll be OK. Her grades in the petroleum engineering program are top-level, and her freshman summer internship  a key element of the program  was exceptional. It's like a gold star on a resume.

She worked as a roustabout in Arkansas. Plas says it was dirty work, and sometimes dangerous.

""I wore flame-retardant clothing, all day long. And it gets rather hot especially when it's a hundred degrees."" She was 19, using a sledgehammer, grateful for the growing-up work on her family's Ohio farm.

In the oil field she lived in a ""man camp"" apartment, which was one-third of a steel shipping container. Around the oil rigs and pipelines, the college textbook pages could come alive. She would think, ""This is what I learned in class."" And then the roughnecks would say, '""Well, this is how it actually works.""

She feels confident she'll come out of the program next year with a job, but in the current economy many of her classmates may not be so lucky. This spring, perhaps only 30 to 40 percent of graduates from the program will have jobs waiting.

And enrollment in September could be off by half. Other big universities with petroleum programs  the University of Texas at Austin, Penn State and Texas A&M  say their numbers are down, too.

And so Marietta students like Jack Glime are watching the market carefully. ""The price of oil now is like probably 33 percent of what it was when I got accepted into the petro program,"" he says. ""It's a day-and-night difference.""

The petro students are required to take history, philosophy, writing and communication courses, which may give them a leg up in shifting career choices.

Nicholas Villaveces, who'll graduate this year, says he's considering law school. ""Patent law is something I'm looking into right now,"" he says, ""and being a liberal arts student is definitely gong to put me at an advantage, and being an engineer, when I apply to law schools.""

That notion would make Bob Chase smile. He's just retired as chair of the petroleum department after 37 years. ""I've got former students that are attorneys, I've got former students that are doctors, believe it or not,"" he says. ""One of my students who went on to become an anesthesiologist made the comment that you'd be amazed at how a capillary is similar to oil flowing through a pipeline.""",[]

i toggle caption Jamie Nelson/Courtesy of the artist Jamie Nelson/Courtesy of the artist

Gwen Stefani hit the pop landscape more than 20 years ago with an arresting declaration: ""I'm just a girl in the world. That's all that you'll let me be."" Since the chart debut of No Doubt in 1995, she's made it her business to be much more  launching a successful solo career, creating a clothing line, starring as a judge on NBC's The Voice, and finding the time between it all to have three children.

And yet, her latest project comes nearly a decade after her last solo release. Like No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom, its songs were forged in the aftermath of a romantic breakup  but as she tells Weekend Edition Sunday, her public image has changed, and with it the stakes of making music.

Stefani spoke with NPR's Rachel Martin about the surprises, missteps and rebounds that led to her new album, This Is What the Truth Feels Like. Hear the radio version at the audio link, and read on for an exchange on songwriting that didn't make the broadcast.

Rachel Martin: This is your first solo release in many years, and the process took a while: You wrote some songs, and then you scrapped them. What happened?

Gwen Stefani: I had done the No Doubt record Push and Shove, and that was a real challenge for me: I think after the giving birth twice, going on multiple tours, all the stuff that I had done, I really got quite burned out after that. Sometimes life is so crazy, you have to go through something to be able to find out what you're supposed to talk about next, and I think that's what happened to me.

I had gotten pregnant with Apollo, and I didn't plan on that  it was just such a beautiful miracle. Four weeks later they called me and, like ""Do you want to do The Voice?"" It was this incredible opportunity to do something different. It's not about me  it's like, ""How can I help you?"" And when you give like that, you receive so much. It was an incredible experience, but it also gave me that bug: I wanted new music so badly.

So, I was trying to cheat a little bit. I was like, ""OK, maybe I can just do it the way everyone else does it: just get other people to write my music for me, and I can kind of tell them what to write, and curate it."" I just gave birth, I'm nursing, I'm on a new TV show and I have two other kids. It's impossible! So let's do it the way we can. And I tried that for a while, and actually had almost a whole record. I put out a song called ""Baby Don't Lie""  I don't know if you remember that one. But overall, it just didn't feel right.

Am I right that you were working on these songs with Pharrell?

You're kind of right: I did write a song with Pharrell. He had called me right after I gave birth and was like, ""Do you want to do Coachella with me?"" It was right at the height of ""Happy,"" and my boys were so obsessed with him. So I got a tour bus, and the first time I walked outside my house after giving birth to Apollo was to do ""Hollaback Girl"" onstage.

It's not like we were super close, but he is one of those people that always pointed me in the right direction. He's quite spiritual, and always said really poignant things to me that changed my life, let alone the music we wrote together.

Like what?

He can read people, you know? He can tell your insecurities and kind of be like, ""Why are you letting everybody control you?"" Things that tap into something inside you that you already know. That's why he's so good on ""The Voice""  he just has that gift. And so, when we were on the show, he came to my dressing room and was like, ""I got a beat! I got a track!"" That was ""Spark the Fire,"" the song that we wrote together, and it was the first bit of writing that I had done in a long time.

I think after doing Push and Shove and having it not be successful, I lost a lot of confidence. Songwriting, for me, has always been traumatic, and I've always made all these excuses. But I've realized that you have to just accept that it was a gift: ""I don't know where it came from, I don't know how I did it, but I did write all those songs, and I gotta do it again.""

Why is songwriting traumatic?

Because when you write a great song, it just blows you away. When you write a song that connects with people around the world  I mean like it actually transcends language barriers  you see how it can affect people, and it's quite a tall order to follow up on. I think when I first started discovering I could write songs, I was so naive. And it was after I got broken up with and had my heart sliced up into a bunch of little pieces that I was like, ""I'm going to say this."" I didn't even know how to play guitar.

We should say  you're talking about your relationship with your bandmate, Tony Kanal. A lot of the songs on Tragic Kingdom, which was a big breakthrough for No Doubt, were written in the context of you two splitting up.

But it's funny  my point is that that record was so naively made. We'd been a band for nine years, never trying to make it. We were making music that was the opposite of grunge and what was popular on the radio, and we were fine with that. And for a garage band, we were massive! We were already successful in our own minds. So when that record came out and made such an impact, and people were relating to it, it was like my life on a plate; it was intense. So, I think I took songwriting real seriously after that, but I never knew how I did it. Because it's not a button that you press.

Is this new album confessional in the same way? Did you have to plumb some of those same emotional spaces to get the songs you wanted?

Well, when I started the first version of this record  the fake, cheating version  the intention was like, ""What can it sound like? I want to be back on the radio. I want this, I want that."" Then, last February, I think a lot of people know that my life fell apart.

You got a divorce.

I got a divorce. The D-word.

From your husband of many years. How long were you married?

Fourteen. Together 20. You just crumble, you know? I was down  I was all the way down. And I just felt like, ""God, I gotta turn this around. I can't go down like this. I have to know that this is happening for a reason."" And I knew that I had to turn to music.

YouTube

I went to the studio and I wrote the first song, and it was this really weird drive on Santa Monica Boulevard, crying the whole way, thinking, ""Why am I going to torture myself even more? I'm already dead."" But I did it  I wrote a song and it felt so right. It was the only thing that felt good at all. That's what this whole record documents  working through it, having faith, believing in myself and wanting to do something about it. And this is the first record I've ever made in real time: ""Used to Love You"" came out three weeks after I wrote it.

It must put you in a vulnerable place. Are there things you won't write about?

I don't know. I didn't edit myself at all.

You've never written a lyric and thought, ""That's too personal. I can't keep that""?

No. Because I'm just writing what I feel, and I really don't think I've done anything wrong that I need to hide. The biggest thing, and I don't even like to bring it up, is my children  you know, you've gotta protect them. I have people that are affected by what I do, what I say, and that would be the one place where it gets complicated. But being honest and truthful  I just believe that's the best way to be.

This is the part of the interview where I have to ask you about Blake Shelton.

Who? [Laughs]

But I have a real question! As you've described it, you went to some dark places with this album as a form of catharsis, to get over a breakup. But judging from your social media, you look to be happy and in a new relationship. Is it as easy to find inspiration and creativity in the joy of a new relationship as it is in the pain of an old one?

I think that's what's so magical about the album: It starts off angry, sad, mad and quite sarcastic  and then really does take a huge change, to hope. People always want to say, ""How do you evolve as a musician?"" The biggest evolution is to write. It's so great to write a record that's mainly about being happy, and that's something new for me.",[]

Maria Sharapova is only the latest high profile athlete to come up against allegations of doping. Mike Pesca of Slate.com has a few lesser known examples.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Time now for sports.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

MARTIN: Tennis player Maria Sharapova has now joined a growing group of professional athletes with a doping scandal hanging over their heads. She tested positive to a recently banned substance. It's called meldonium. It happened at the Australian Open. She said she was taking it for a family history of diabetes and didn't know the drug had been banned. Sharapova is probably one of the most visible athletes in the world, but just how prevalent is doping among those athletes without a Nike contract? Let's ask Mike Pesca. He's the host of ""The Gist.""

Good morning.

JOE PESCA: Or even with a Nike contract.

MARTIN: Yeah, right? I mean, it seems like every time we turn around, there's another professional athlete being accused of doping. So what's going on?

PESCA: Well, in the case of Sharapova, everything you said is true, but the context is - sure, this was just newly banned. But everyone who looked at drugs and looked at doping said, well, we know what the drug is doing, and though it has some non-performative purposes, in fact, this drug was first invented and one of the first uses was to help Russian soldiers in the high mountains of Afghanistan because it helps with oxygen intake, exactly what a lot of illegal drugs do. So finally, it got to the tennis list. It was banned in track and field. It got to the tennis list, and the word went out. You've got to stop taking this. And so, you know, Sharapova is saying - oh, I was taking this for real reasons and I just missed a memo. You know, even her excuse - that I was taking it for diabetes - you're supposed to take it for four to six weeks. She was taking it continuously. It was obviously helping her performance. I'm not saying it makes her a bad person, but it was clear what she was doing. This drug was helping her performance.

MARTIN: So you say that this - it's affecting not just the big sports, but things we don't pay attention to. There was some race in track and field that caught your eye.

PESCA: Yeah, this is the thing. When we talk about this, I think sometimes our discussion hinges on the personality involved. I mean, we usually - when we hear about sports and a scandal, it's via a superstar, right - so a Peyton Manning allegation or, here, Sharapova. And then even if it's not - even if it's a journeyman Major League Baseball player, those guys are millionaires.

Well what about the 1,500 meters in the last London Olympics? Earlier this week, the silver medalist of that race was found to have cheated, which means - if you go down the list of who cheated in the 1,500 meters - the gold medalist, the silver medalist, the fourth-place finisher the fifth, seventh and ninth-place finishers. So this means that an American runner, Shannon Rowbury, who thought she finished sixth and was gutted and cried and was despondent and actually said this just means that the best I could possibly give isn't good enough. No, that was all a lie because all of her competitors - or so many of her competitors were cheating. And the Olympics haven't gotten in touch with her and said here's your silver medal, but she clearly deserves the silver medal as the clean one in that race.

MARTIN: But so - I don't understand. If everyone is doing this...

PESCA: That's the thing. That's the thing.

MARTIN: ...I mean, shouldn't you just change the standards or change the rules?

PESCA: That's exactly the thing. I think that the best argument against cheating is not that our sports aren't entertaining or fair, and it's not that the people who are doing it are bad people. It's that not - literally, not everyone is doing it. But if you create a norm where it becomes hard not to do it, you're forcing people who don't want to cheat to cheat. You're forcing people who don't want to hurt their bodies to hurt their bodies. We don't know 100 percent that Shannon Rowbury didn't do it, but she seems, like, as sympathetic a victim as there is - not a pitcher who gave up a home run to Barry Bonds, but a runner who tried her hardest, thought her hardest wasn't the best, but it turns out it was drugs that was keeping her off the medal stand.

MARTIN: Mike Pesca - host of ""The Gist"" on Slate. Thanks so much, Mike.

PESCA: You're welcome.

i Elizabeth Maidl/courtesy of Washington University at St. Louis Elizabeth Maidl/courtesy of Washington University at St. Louis

It used to be common knowledge: Malnourished kids need more protein to thrive. Then came a scathing paper in the Lancet in 1974 called ""The Great Protein Fiasco."" Filled with sarcasm, it argued that the nutrition community's fixation on protein was a waste of time and money.

""There is mounting recognition that the emphasis which has been given to the role of protein in human undernutrition, resulting in the claim that there is a global protein 'gap,' 'crisis,' or 'problem,' is wrong,"" wrote author Donald McLaren, then a clinical nutrition professor at the American University's School of Medicine in Beirut.

The paper hit the field hard, says Richard Semba, an expert on health and nutrition in developing countries, who is based at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. Protein researchers weren't even invited to the next world food conference. And for the following decades, malnutrition researchers focused on vitamins, minerals and calories.

It may be time for another pendulum shift, suggest Semba's latest findings. For a study published last month, he and colleagues visited rural villages in southern Malawi, where they found that chronically malnourished young children were low in all essential amino acids.

Vitamins remain essential, he says. But the new results, along with other accumulating evidence, suggest that protein needs to be a bigger part of the picture.

""It's not just micronutrients that are going to save the world,"" Semba says. ""I think we're going to see a sea change in the international nutritional community.""

The rural villagers whom he studied in Malawi take meticulous care of their thatched-roof mud huts. But without electricity or running water in many places, kids suffer high rates of diarrhea and other illnesses.

With eggs as a once-a-month luxury, along with low-nutrient corn porridge as the major source of solid food for babies, the result is widespread chronic malnutrition and stunting. This condition, in which kids are very short for their age, sets children up for a lifetime's worth of problems.

Although the global nutrition community rejected the importance of protein in the 1970s, micronutrient supplements alone have failed to make a dent in chronic malnutrition among children. Meanwhile, researchers have increasingly acknowledged the cascade of negative consequences that come from lack of adequate nutrition in the first 1,000 days of life.

Chronic malnutrition is particularly insidious, says Martin Bloem, chief nutritionist at the U.N. World Food Programme, who also teaches at Johns Hopkins but was not affiliated with the new study. Unlike kids with severe acute malnutrition, who are often extremely skinny and bloated, kids with chronic malnutrition can be normally proportioned but stunted.

And while being short may not seem like a big deal, failure to grow in height in the first couple years of life is a sign that the brain and organs are also not developing sufficiently. Later in life, stunting has been linked to higher risks for obesity, diabetes and other chronic diseases.

As many as 40 percent of children are stunted in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, Bloem says. Globally, a quarter of all kids under age 5 are too short for their age.

With evidence growing over the last few years that it's time to revive the protein trail, Semba and colleagues measured the heights of 313 rural Malawian kids between the ages of 1 and 5. They also took blood samples.

More than 60 percent of the kids were stunted, the researchers reported in EBioMedicine. And, compared to taller children, blood levels of all essential amino acids in stunted kids were 15 to 20 percent lower, suggesting that those kids are consuming significantly less protein. ""It was more striking than we expected,"" Semba says.

The team is now analyzing links between stunting and socioeconomics. In a region where owning a bicycle is a major status symbol, Semba suspects that families with even slightly more money are able to feed animal proteins to their kids more often. Hygiene may also play a role. Frequent bouts of diarrhea can deprive kids of the nutrients they need to grow well.

""The findings of the new study are very important because they show that amino acids play a key role in this problem,"" Bloem says, adding that the World Food Programme delivers food to 100 million people a year in the most difficult circumstances. ""It's always a big discussion for us about what is the optimal food.""

Cost remains a major barrier. Meat, milk and fish contain all the most important amino acids, but animal products are expensive. For its part, the World Food Programme is working with the Clinton Health Initiative in Rwanda to create a baby cereal fortified with essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids.

The new study also emphasizes the need to revise recommended protein requirements for kids in challenging environments, says Ricardo Uauy, a nutritional biochemist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the University of Chile, who was not involved in the new research.

Frequent illnesses and other stresses increase the amount of protein that children need to grow to their full potential, Uauy says. Inflammation of the gut after regular bouts of diarrhea, for example, reduces the body's ability to absorb nutrients and can increase protein needs by between 30 and 50 percent.

""The new study is saying we have to study children in real-world conditions, not in an environment where everything is perfectly clean,"" he says. ""That condition is the minority.""

In the real world, in other words, protein is not a fiasco but a necessity.",[]

She may not be as well-known as her son Marc Morial, a former mayor of New Orleans and current head of the National Urban League, or her late husband Ernest ""Dutch"" Morial, the city's first African-American mayor. But her story parallels that of hundreds of other women throughout history, those who played critical roles in this country's important moments, but often stayed behind the scenes.

Sybil Morial writes about her beginnings in the cocoon of the the black middle class, where she was shielded  but never immune  from the degradations of life under segregation. She details her political activism as she got older. In the 1960s and '70s, she started a civic league to register African-Americans to vote, because she couldn't join the League of Women Voters.

Morial spoke with NPR's Michel Martin about how dealing with segregation as a child affected her decisions as an adult.

Interview Highlights

On why she wanted to write a memoir

My memoir was really instigated by Hurricane Katrina. I was displaced, my house flooded. I was displaced and moved to Baton Rouge and was there for eight years before I restored my house. I had flood and then fire and then litigation. So while I lost all of my memorabilia, photographs, papers and little things that remind you of incidents and events, I began to collect my memories in my head. And write them down. And after I had done about 15 events, I thought, I have a book here  I want to do this for my children and grandchildren. So that was the genesis of this memoir.

It was absolutely cathartic for me to be on this level while I was dealing with the tragedies.

On her childhood

My family was middle-class and they provided a good life ... in this cocoon, where we were exposed to many things through the two African-American universities, Dillard and Xavier University. We couldn't go to the public places  the symphony, the opera, the theatre  so we went to what was provided by these two black schools. And the social class was a tight-knit group where everybody's mother looked out for everybody's child. It was a happy time. ...

But when we stepped out of our homes, here we were blocked from everything, subject to humiliation. Couldn't go to public places. So it was sort of a double life. But this cocoon made it very bearable  it was good inside that cocoon.

On a childhood experience going to a park with friends

It looked so beautiful, the beautiful architecture of the museum at the end of this long walk. The lagoons on the sides  the trees and shrubbery. And we dared to go in. We rode our bikes in and were talking under the trees where it was cool. And pretty soon a policeman came up and shook his nightstick at us and said, ""You little 'n's, get out of here, you know you don't belong here!"" And he was very aggressive. So we turned our bicycles around and left the park. And after we got outside we stopped to catch our breath and talked. And said, ""Look, we can't let our parents know this, because they know we're not supposed to go in the park."" We were not allowed there. And they didn't know that story until years later, and by then, the rules were changing and Jim Crow was on the run.

On an experience at a debutante ball that led to becoming more politically aware

I was a debutante but it was not something that I really wanted to do. Some girls look forward to that. It was just something you did. But I guess that was my awakening  you know? This is so false. We're mimicking royalty, but when we step out the door, we're certainly not royalty. We have to step back, we're resented, we're rejected, we're humiliated.

So I was 17 years old and I think that was the awakening of my adulthood and what I was going to do with my life. It wasn't all framed then, but it was the beginning.

On being black and standards of beauty

It was in the '60s during the civil rights movement. [A student] came to school one morning all disheveled. Her face all dusty with tears rolling down her dusty face. Her hair all unbraided. And she was crying, and she told me, ""Ms. Morial, Billy beat me up."" I said, ""Why did he beat you up?"" She said, ""Well he called me 'black,' and nobody's going to call me black and get away with it, so I punched him in the nose.""

And that's when a light went on in my head. I said, ""My goodness, we all have been conditioned to think that black is ugly."" ...

I sat down with the class and we talked about it. And I said, ""Our dark skin, our broad features, our kinky hair  that's what we are. And we are beautiful and we need to accept that.""

I brought that in stories  not in those words  for the rest of my teaching career. That black is beautiful. What we look like is beautiful. That's what we are, we're not going to look any other way. Let's accept it. White America has set different standards, and they're not standards of beauty for us. So that was a good lesson for my students and for myself.",[]

It was among the first campaign websites, and it's still archived online for all to see. Robert Arena, director of Internet strategy for the campaign, takes a stroll down memory lane.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Hey, guys. Kind of a rough political season, huh? Makes you long for a simpler time, like, I don't know, 1996 maybe? ""Jerry Maguire"" was the big movie.

(SOUNDBITE OF FILM, ""JERRY MAGUIRE"")

TOM CRUISE: (As Jerry Maguire) Show me the money.

GOODING JR.: (As Rod Tidwell) Jerry, you better yell.

CRUISE: (As Jerry Maguire) Show me the money.

MARTIN: Celine Dion was climbing the charts.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME"")

CELINE DION: (Singing) I'm everything I am because you loved me.

MARTIN: It was the early days of the Internet, the World Wide Web. And while there's not a lot that survives from the pre-high-speed days, you know what's still there? A snapshot of 1996 in the form of the campaign website of Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole and his running mate, Jack Kemp. Robert Arena was a 22-year-old kid when he built that site, and he took us on a tour. First, he set the scene.

(SOUNDBITE OF MODEM DIALING)

ROBERT ARENA: Back in the '90s, high speed would've been a 56 K modem. So today, a 50-megabit connection would be considered somewhat fast. That is 1,000 times faster than the Internet speeds that we working with back in 1996.

MARTIN: Wow.

ARENA: In total, there were 20 million people on Internet, and that's worldwide. Google did not exist. You might have had your own personal webpage at GeoCities, which was one of the top...

MARTIN: Oh, yes.

ARENA: ...Websites back in 1996. So you would've waited for everybody to get off the phone so that you could use your phone line, and your dial-up modem would screech to life. And then after going through your Internet service provider, you would have come to what was the very, very early days of the World Wide Web. So there was no Flash back in those days, we were just going to see things call Shockwaves, so websites were very flat.

MARTIN: OK, so here I am, looking at Robert's website, dolecamp96.org, and it does look tiny and a little flat. And then I notice something.

Can we talk about this coffee cup?

ARENA: The rotating GIF file.

MARTIN: (Laughter) There is a coffee cup on the front of the website...

ARENA: ...Steaming hot.

MARTIN: It is - the steam is moving. This is, like, groundbreaking stuff.

ARENA: Rachel, this technology is all over Snapchat and text messages right now.

MARTIN: It's true.

ARENA: I mean, that's really what this is. We are really trying to make a website that was interactive. But at the same time, you're stuck on a modem, so you can't really have video files everywhere. This was the technology to make something move back in 1996.

MARTIN: OK, but as much as Robert Arena is telling a story about nostalgia, it is also a story about foresight.

ARENA: We ended up with about 15,000 people volunteered for this campaign online in 1996.

MARTIN: Wow.

ARENA: In today's numbers, that doesn't sound like a lot. But again, relative to where we were, that impact of that was something like one-quarter of our small business coalition was generated on the Internet. We actually did do fundraising online. If you gave $25 in the primary, you got a free Dole for president mouse pad mailed to you.

MARTIN: (Laughter).

ARENA: But certainly all the customization features we were driving towards were really about list-building and really creating a one-to-one relationship with an individual voter. And that's really what Internet's promise was, particularly in the political space back then, was to bypass the traditional media and speak directly to the voter.

MARTIN: That's Robert Arena. He was the director of Internet strategy for the '96 Dole campaign. Oh, and one more thing.

ARENA: When we went to the general election, we redid our letterhead. And we were not allowed to put the website address on the letterhead because person at the time in charge of that thought that it would look like a typo.

MARTIN: And so to those of you working with fresh-faced 22-year-olds as I happen to, listen to them because everyone once in a while, they might have a pretty good idea.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BECAUSE YOU LOVED ME"")

i toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images Joe Raedle/Getty Images

When Bernie Sanders won the primary in Michigan last week, it shook up the narrative of the Democratic race.

Sanders did so with the help of white men. If he's able to pull off a victory in Ohio, the same demographic will likely be key.

Take Jim, who describes himself, only half jokingly, as an angry white man.

""We're pissed off,"" Jim said. (Jim's asked that his last name be withheld because his union, AFSCME, has endorsed Hillary Clinton, and he supports Sanders. He can't be quoted publicly going against his union.) ""We haven't gotten raises. Our pensions have been cut. Our healthcare's increased.""

And, Jim added, Sanders speaks to that. ""Bernie, he speaks from the trenches,"" Jim said. ""We feel that he's fighting for us.""

In Michigan, Sanders won with the support of 62 percent of white men, who were one-in-three voters, according to exit polls. In 2008, in the Democratic primary in Ohio, white men turned out in strikingly similar proportions to this year's Michigan contest.

At the same time, black voters could make up a smaller proportion of the electorate and likely won't be enough to put Clinton over the top. In Michigan, Clinton won more than two-thirds of black voters and they were 21 percent of the electorate. In 2008, Barack Obama won nearly 90 percent of black voters in Ohio; they were just 18 percent of the electorate; and Clinton won the state, ironically, with the support of white voters, including white men.

Ryan, a member of a building trades union in Cleveland, who also asked NPR not to use his last name because his union has endorsed Clinton, feels the same way as Jim.

""She's [Clinton] seen as the centrist candidate,"" Ryan said. ""And she's a big-money candidate. And big money and centrism hasn't been working for middle-class America for the past 30 years. Since Reagan.""

When Ryan first saw Sanders speak a few months ago, something clicked. He said it was as if a politician was finally saying what Ryan had been thinking about the state of the country. Ryan was so swayed he even sent a small donation to Sanders campaign and later bought a T-shirt.

'Like NASCAR, everyone wear their patch'

toggle caption Domenico Montanaro/2016, 2008 exit polls

At a union hall in Cleveland, both Jim and Ryan talked about rising health-care costs and trade deals that they believe have hurt much more than they helped.

Sanders overwhelmingly won voters in Michigan who thought trade deals cost American jobs  58 percent of voters said so there, and Sanders won them 2-to-1. (One-in-three Michigan voters said they lived in a household with a union member. Clinton and Sanders split them. Likely accounting for that were black union members who went for Clinton. Those numbers are not split out in exit polls.)

Jim said he's only gotten one raise, really more like a cost-of-living adjustment, in eight years.

""You look at the stock market,"" he said, ""it's gone up I don't know how many, a couple of hundred percent. You know, my wages have gone up 2-and-a-half percent. And who's speaking to that? Bernie is. And, yeah, I think maybe he's kind of like Don Quixote. But I mean that's part of the attraction. It really is. At least for me.""

And Jim insists, this isn't about gender. He loves his congresswoman, who incidentally endorsed Sanders on Friday.

There are elements of Clinton's stump speech designed to speak to working-class men including the parts where she talks about punishing companies that ship jobs overseas. But it's clear from these interviews that Sanders' attacks on Clinton's trade record, her superPAC, her big money speeches to Wall Street banks  they are breaking through.

The money issue nags at Dave Passalacqua. He likes that Sanders gets his campaign cash from regular people.

""There's that old saying is politicians should be like NASCAR, everyone wear their patch,"" Passalacqua said. ""You know, let's see what the patches are and [Sanders] doesn't need to wear a patch, because it's his own thing.""

'Pie in the sky'

Passalacqua is executive vice president of the Communications Workers of America Local 4340 in Cleveland. His union has endorsed Sanders, but he's still undecided.

Passalacqua agreed to meet at a Cleveland diner along with Jim Goggin, a fixture in the city's labor community. He's an organizer for the Delaware Valley Health Care Coalition.

""It's pie in the sky,"" said Goggin, with an unmistakable Irish lilt. ""I mean, everything Bernie says, I think would be fantastic. But the fact of the matter is, that I am also a realist, and I know that you can't do that.""

For Goggin, it is all about beating the Republicans in November.

""And I wish to God that I thought he could win,"" Goggin said. ""But I don't unfortunately think he can win. Consequently, I'm with Hillary, because at least she's not going to throw us under the bus, the working people.""

Passalacqua chimes in: ""And one good thing that Bernie's been doing, though, even with Hillary, is Bernie has moved Hillary's positions on things.""

From the outside, it seems Passalacqua is having a classic voter's struggle between his head and his heart. He isn't convinced Sanders will be able to do what he's promising. Who will he vote for?

""Whoever I think is going best for me and my family is the bottom line. Whoever is going to make  not to steal Donald's line, but  America great again,"" said Pasalaqua quoting Donald Trump's catch phrase. ""Because in order to make America great again we've got to make the middle class great again. So whoever's going to do that, I think's going to be the best person. And that's who I'll end up having to vote for.""

No matter how Tuesday's vote turns out, and no matter who wins the nomination, all four men said they would support the Democratic nominee in November.",[]

i toggle caption Paul Sancya/AP Paul Sancya/AP

Where powerful streams converge, there will be turbulence. That applies to politics as well as to waterways.

Right now, two powerful streams of Republicanism in our time are converging on Cleveland and threatening to define the party's national convention in July.

One of these streams is like a historic river, long settled in its course. The other is more like a flood, surging beyond its banks to render the landscape unrecognizable.

Ted Cruz, the uber-conservative senator from Texas, has emerged as the candidate of the old-school stream, which now carries him toward a confrontation with Donald Trump, the man who unleashed the pent-up force of the new flood.

History is in the balance. It has become almost a commonplace to say the coming clash in Cleveland may determine not only the 2016 nominee but the survival of the Republican Party as we know it.

History is also the backdrop against which this battle will be fought, providing insight into the process and the outcome.

The Cruz forces in the party are the recognizable heirs of its Regulars of generations ago. Their beliefs have been the bedrock for the Grand Old Party since it started calling itself that in the 19th century.

Their credo prizes individual liberty over government programs and regulations. They are ever-respectful of states and suspicious of Washington. They detest taxes and have no use for labor unions. They are steeped in traditional social values, faith-based religion and commitment to a strong national defense.

These legacy conservatives fought the party's progressives a century ago, resisting also the New Deal in the 1930s and the Great Society in the 1960s. Sometimes labeled the ""Old Right,"" or ""paleo-conservatives,"" they have kept their flame alive through decades when the party typically chose centrists or moderate conservatives for president who were acceptable to the party establishment.

(Explore a century of intra-party convention wars here.)

In the current Congress, the revival of old-school conservatism is alive in the Freedom Caucus, a relatively new alliance of about 40 mostly junior members. In the fall of 2013, when the government shut down for 16 days over funding for Obamacare, members of the Freedom Caucus huddled with one newly elected freshman senator to plot strategy.

That senator was Ted Cruz.

Trump's Legion

But present day Republicanism is also driven by a host of newer arrivals, visible in the thousands crowding into Trump's rallies and the millions following Trump on Twitter. Surely the Trump phenomenon has to do with his highly personal brand and media magnetism, but the voters he represents are not simply a personality cult.

Many of them trace their ""roots"" as Republicans back no farther than the Tea Party movement that arose in response to the first months of President Obama's first term. Others may have come to the GOP during its growth spurt in the Ronald Reagan era, when the Republican tent expanded to welcome ""Reagan Democrats.""

For decades, Southern voters who preferred Reagan or Richard Nixon, continued to vote Democratic for other offices. But that changed in 1994, when in one midterm election the ""Solid South"" went from having a majority of Democratic governors, senators and members of Congress to having Republican majorities in all three categories. And the GOP has held on to those majorities ever since, adding majorities in state legislatures as well.

These newer Republicans, whether Reagan era or drawn to Trump, tend to be working people and business people who have gravitated to the Republican Party as they aged and as the parties changed.

They are predominantly older, white and Anglo, and most of them are men. They come from all levels of education and affluence, but many do not have college degrees or high incomes.

And whatever their backgrounds, they are as much a part of the Grand New Party as their more ideologically orthodox cousins who have been there for generations.

The new arrivals do not necessarily disagree with the old-school GOP on any of its basic tenets, but they are much more recent in their association with the party  and potentially more transient as well. Their energy comes not so much from roots and principles as from their reaction to immediate issues and pressures.

They feel their economic security and cultural comfort level being threatened by immigration and greater diversity, by social change and activist government. When they hear Trump say ""make America great again,"" they hear a promise of their own personal restoration  individually and as a group.

History Of Conflict

This new conflict, between the parties of Cruz and Trump, draws from deep wells of resentment and dissent within Republicanism  feelings that may be reinforced by personal rivalries based in region and personality, as well as ideology.

At one time, the party had a robust progressive wing that supported President Theodore Roosevelt and often worked with like-minded Democrats in Congress.

Later, there were Republicans, often called the Eastern Establishment, who shared some of the goals of the New Deal in the 1930s and stood with relatively centrist presidents of both parties (Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower) in the 1940s and 1950s.

In this era, the term ""liberal Republican"" was not an oxymoron. In 1964, four of five Republicans in Congress voted for the Civil Rights Act. Republican votes defeated the filibuster by southern Democrats in the Senate.

But thereafter, the party of Lincoln experienced a sea change. The pivotal moment came in 1964, when Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater broke from his own party's Senate leaders to vote against the Civil Rights Act. One month later, the Republican Party's national convention nominated for him president.

In November, Goldwater carried just six states, his home state and five in the Deep South (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina) that were disillusioned with President Lyndon Johnson for ending racial segregation.

Goldwater lost, but the party's new focus on the South survived. In 1968, Richard Nixon won the Republican nomination and embarked on what was called a ""Southern Strategy."" One symbol of the shift was party switcher Strom Thurmond, a South Carolina Dixiecrat who had run against his own Democratic president as the ""States Rights Party"" nominee in 1948. In 1964, the Republican Nixon claimed most of the states of the Confederacy. He would win them all four years later.

When Ronald Reagan became the face of the Republican Party in the 1980s, he smiled even more broadly on the South, launching his first campaign as the GOP nominee from Mississippi with praise for the code phrase ""states rights.""

The states of the South, together with the Mountain States, became the base of the ""Republican lock"" on the White House in that era  and remain its best source of electoral votes today. Since the 1990s, the same states have been home base for Republican majorities in Congress as well.

The racial overtones of the party divide have since become even more unmistakable. Black voters deserted the GOP nationwide even as white voters, especially white men, felt increasingly at home there. This has intensified in the Obama years, expressing itself in the ""birther"" challenge to Obama's citizenship and in elements of the Tea Party uprising as well. When asked about the birther issue, even prominent Republican officials typically said they ""didn't know"" whether Obama was born in the U.S. or not.

Among those who kept talking up the birther story longest was Donald Trump.

Effect On 2016

Some moderates do remain in Republican ranks. Some polls suggest as many as 30 percent of Republicans might self-identify as moderates or moderate conservatives. Some support abortion rights and same sex marriage, and their views on immigration may be as varied as the nation's.

But in the 2016 presidential primaries, this center-right fraction of the party has been nearly invisible amid the media attention to Trump and a few rival conservatives.

Beyond that, the old establishment has been without a hero to rally around. Jeb Bush, scion of the party's last dynastic family, did not make it to Super Tuesday.

John Kasich, the Ohio governor, is one of the last four contenders standing, and could reasonably be called a fallback for the party's vestigial center-right. But at this point, Kasich appears in the running primarily as a prospective running mate.

This lack of a horse for the establishment (or moderates, or moderate conservatives) to ride demonstrates how the intraparty wars have moved. The new competition is between kinds of conservatives: basically, between conservatives old and new.",[]

Somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, there is a bronze chest filled with gold and precious gems. The search for this hidden treasure has become a hobby for some, an obsession for others, and for one recent searcher  a fatal pursuit.

i toggle caption Courtesy of Forrest Fenn Courtesy of Forrest Fenn

The man behind the treasure is Forrest Fenn, an 85-year-old millionaire, former Vietnam fighter pilot, self-taught archaeologist, and successful art dealer in Santa Fe, N.M.

""No one knows where that treasure chest is but me,"" Fenn says. ""If I die tomorrow, the knowledge of that location goes in the coffin with me.""

The ornate, Romanesque box is 10-by-10 inches and weighs about 40 pounds when loaded. Fenn has only revealed that it is hidden in the Rocky Mountains, somewhere between Santa Fe and the Canadian border at an elevation above 5,000 feet. It's not in a mine, a graveyard or near a structure. For further clues, you have to read the poem in his self-published book, The Thrill of the Chase.

Here is one stanza:

Begin it where warm waters halt And take it in the canyon down, Not far, but too far to walk. Put in below the home of Brown.

""'Where warm waters halt,' no one agrees on what that means. Does that mean where two rivers converge? Does that mean where a hot spring pours into a river? Does that mean at the Continental Divide?"" says Sacha Johnston, an avid searcher in Albuquerque. She runs a website that sells Fenn treasure tchotchkes.

Now, six years after publication of the poem, tens of thousands of people have reportedly gone looking for Fenn's treasure, thought to be worth well over a million dollars.

Cheer Folks Up And Go Outside

Fenn sits at his laptop in the study of his Santa Fe manse, his blue eyes twinkling mischievously. He reads emails all day from treasure hunters imploring him for further clues.

""That's the kind of email that I don't respond to,"" he says, ""Because if you want me to give you a clue I'm not going to answer your email.""

i toggle caption Benchmark Maps/Courtesy of Forrest Fenn Benchmark Maps/Courtesy of Forrest Fenn

Surrounding him is his extraordinary collection of Native American artifacts such as Apache dolls, moccasin boots and buffalo skulls.

""I love antiques, particularly American Indian,"" he says.

In the 1990s, he was criticized by Southwestern archaeologists over his excavation of a Pueblo Indian site that he owned. They consider him a plunderer; Fenn thinks they're ""clubby fussbudgets.""

The war over Indian relics has largely subsided. Today, Fenn is all about the treasure. He says he hid the box in the midst of the Great Recession to cheer folks up and to get them off their couches and into the great outdoors.

""Sure, I'm eccentric,"" he says. ""I pride myself on being eccentric. I don't want to go down the center line like a lot of people do.""

The Missing Treasure Hunter ... And The Missing Treasure?

The hunt for the treasure can become an obsession.

Randy Bilyeu was a 54-year-old retired mechanic who had moved from Florida to Colorado to look for the bronze box full time. He was last seen alive on Jan. 5. His car, a raft, and his little dog were found near the Rio Grande south of Santa Fe.

Think you're good at cracking codes? Read Forrest Fenn's poem with clues to the treasure: As I have gone alone in there

And with my treasures bold,

I can keep my secret where,

And hint of riches new and old. Begin it where warm waters halt

And take it in the canyon down,

Not far, but too far to walk.

Put in below the home of Brown. From there it's no place for the meek,

The end is ever drawing nigh;

There'll be no paddle up your creek,

Just heavy loads and water high. If you've been wise and found the blaze,

Look quickly down, your quest to cease,

But tarry scant with marvel gaze,

Just take the chest and go in peace. So why is it that I must go

And leave my trove for all to seek?

The answers I already know,

I've done it tired, and now I'm weak. So hear me all and listen good,

Your effort will be worth the cold.

If you are brave and in the wood

I give you title to the gold.

Fenn is delighted the quest has motivated so many people to discover the Rocky Mountains, but he cautions: ""We don't want to get anybody else lost. Be prepared. Take a GPS. Take at least one other person with you. And wait [until] the snow and the ice melts.""

Is the treasure really worth risking your life over?

Doug Preston is a best-selling author and a longtime friend of Fenn's. He says he saw the chest in the walk-in vault in Fenn's house before he hid it, and Preston can attest that it was filled with gold nuggets, gold coins, pre-Colombian gold figures, rubies, sapphires, emeralds and diamonds.

""As far as proof goes [that he hid the treasure] there's no proof,"" Preston says. He also lives in Santa Fe. ""It's hard to prove a negative. The negative is that the chest is gone. It's not in his house and it's not in his vault. And also knowing Forrest for as long as I have, I can absolutely say with 100 percent confidence that he would never pull off a hoax. I'm absolutely sure that he hid that treasure chest.""

A noted New Mexico archaeologist contacted for this story says he, too, saw the treasure and he also believes Fenn is not a trickster.

The searchers read and re-read the cryptic poem and pore over topographic maps, waiting for the ""aha"" moment. Then they trek through aspen forests, explore riverbanks, and belay down cliff sides looking for the treasure.

""You go out, you look, you don't find it, you come back home, you go through your clues again, your solves again and you think, 'Where did I go wrong?'"" says Cynthia Meachum, a retired high-tech worker in Albuquerque who says she's been out at least 60 times looking for the treasure. ""And you go out and you do it again. And I have actually seen some of the most spectacular scenery because of this that I ever would've seen.""

And for that, Fenn would be pleased.",[]

If you're from New Orleans, you're probably familiar with the Morial family. Two of them have served as mayors of the city. But the story of Sybil Haydel Morial has not been fully told until now.

Sybil Morial is the author of a new memoir, Witness to Change: From Jim Crow to Empowerment, which details her life fighting against segregation and racism in New Orleans.

She may not be as well-known as her son Marc Morial, a former mayor of New Orleans and current head of the National Urban League, or her late husband Ernest ""Dutch"" Morial, the city's first African-American mayor. But her story parallels that of hundreds of other women throughout history, those who played critical roles in this country's important moments, but often stayed behind the scenes.

Sybil Morial writes about her beginnings in the cocoon of the the black middle class, where she was shielded  but never immune  from the degradations of life under segregation. She details her political activism as she got older. In the 1960s and '70s, she started a civic league to register African-Americans to vote, because she couldn't join the League of Women Voters.

Morial spoke with NPR's Michel Martin about how dealing with segregation as a child affected her decisions as an adult.

On why she wanted to write a memoir

My memoir was really instigated by Hurricane Katrina. I was displaced, my house flooded. I was displaced and moved to Baton Rouge and was there for eight years before I restored my house. I had flood and then fire and then litigation. So while I lost all of my memorabilia, photographs, papers and little things that remind you of incidents and events, I began to collect my memories in my head. And write them down. And after I had done about 15 events, I thought, I have a book here  I want to do this for my children and grandchildren. So that was the genesis of this memoir.

It was absolutely cathartic for me to be on this level while I was dealing with the tragedies.

On her childhood

My family was middle-class and they provided a good life ... in this cocoon, where we were exposed to many things through the two African-American universities, Dillard and Xavier University. We couldn't go to the public places  the symphony, the opera, the theatre  so we went to what was provided by these two black schools. And the social class was a tight-knit group where everybody's mother looked out for everybody's child. It was a happy time. ...

But when we stepped out of our homes, here we were blocked from everything, subject to humiliation. Couldn't go to public places. So it was sort of a double life. But this cocoon made it very bearable  it was good inside that cocoon.

On a childhood experience going to a park with friends

It looked so beautiful, the beautiful architecture of the museum at the end of this long walk. The lagoons on the sides  the trees and shrubbery. And we dared to go in. We rode our bikes in and were talking under the trees where it was cool. And pretty soon a policeman came up and shook his nightstick at us and said, ""You little 'n's, get out of here, you know you don't belong here!"" And he was very aggressive. So we turned our bicycles around and left the park. And after we got outside we stopped to catch our breath and talked. And said, ""Look, we can't let our parents know this, because they know we're not supposed to go in the park."" We were not allowed there. And they didn't know that story until years later, and by then, the rules were changing and Jim Crow was on the run.

On an experience at a debutante ball that led to becoming more politically aware

I was a debutante but it was not something that I really wanted to do. Some girls look forward to that. It was just something you did. But I guess that was my awakening  you know? This is so false. We're mimicking royalty, but when we step out the door, we're certainly not royalty. We have to step back, we're resented, we're rejected, we're humiliated.

So I was 17 years old and I think that was the awakening of my adulthood and what I was going to do with my life. It wasn't all framed then, but it was the beginning.

On being black and standards of beauty

It was in the '60s during the civil rights movement. [A student] came to school one morning all disheveled. Her face all dusty with tears rolling down her dusty face. Her hair all unbraided. And she was crying, and she told me, ""Ms. Morial, Billy beat me up."" I said, ""Why did he beat you up?"" She said, ""Well he called me 'black,' and nobody's going to call me black and get away with it, so I punched him in the nose.""

And that's when a light went on in my head. I said, ""My goodness, we all have been conditioned to think that black is ugly."" ...

I sat down with the class and we talked about it. And I said, ""Our dark skin, our broad features, our kinky hair  that's what we are. And we are beautiful and we need to accept that.""

I brought that in stories  not in those words  for the rest of my teaching career. That black is beautiful. What we look like is beautiful. That's what we are, we're not going to look any other way. Let's accept it. White America has set different standards, and they're not standards of beauty for us. So that was a good lesson for my students and for myself.",[]

Rachel Martin speaks with Chris Bachelder. His novel tells the story of a group of friends who gather each year to re-enact the gruesome injury sustain by quarterback Joe Theisman.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Football fans of a certain age can still recall with horror a particular moment during a ""Monday Night Football"" game in 1985. Washington quarterback Joe Theismann ran a play called the flea flicker, and it left him wide open to the hard-charging linebacker of the New York Giants, Lawrence Taylor.

(SOUNDBITE OF ""MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL"")

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And it was Lawrence Taylor who slammed Theismann to the ground at the 42-yard line. The blitz was on. That's not necessarily a good play to have called. And quickly, Lawrence Taylor is up saying Theismann is hurt.

MARTIN: Yeah. Theismann was really hurt. His right leg snapped in two. His football career ended that night. This moment frozen in sports history is at the heart of a new novel by Chris Bachelder. It's called ""The Throwback Special,"" and it's a surprisingly funny and poignant story about a group of friends who reunite every year to re-enact that play and then reflect on their middle-aged lives in the process. Chris Bachelder joins us from member station WVXU in Cincinnati.

Chris, welcome to the program.

CHRIS BACHELDER: Thank you. It's my pleasure.

MARTIN: When did you first see this football play happen? Were you old enough to have watched it when it actually occurred (laughter)?

BACHELDER: Yes, I was. I was 14, I think, in 1985.

MARTIN: Yeah.

BACHELDER: And those games were on at 9, and I usually watched at least the first half and this happened early in the second quarter, so I saw it.

MARTIN: So I hadn't seen it. And so I had to go watch it, you know, in preparation for having this conversation with you. And I don't know if it was just the clip I found on YouTube, but the - at the first look at it, just the camera angle, didn't show it. You know, you just see Lawrence Taylor, L.T., like, holding his helmet, and clearly, he's upset and something bad has transpired. And then they're, like, let's go to the reverse angle cam and then they play it again. This is horrible.

BACHELDER: It's awful, and I'm sorry to introduce you to it. But it's - yeah, it's just awful.

MARTIN: So this clearly stayed with you for many years. How in the world did you come up with this conceit to use this event as the fulcrum around which to build a novel about these guys?

BACHELDER: You know, it was a kind of slow and gradual process. I think I originally thought the power was in the play itself. And there's plenty of power there, but the kind of literary power or energy that I was feeling had to do more with that play plus time - plus 25 or 30 years. So when you bring nostalgia into the mix - when you bring a sort of middle-aged man into the mix, reflecting on the play, you have two times existing together. The play was my context, not my subject.

MARTIN: These guys - these characters in your book help us set the scene. Every year they get together in his hotel - it's the same hotel every year?

BACHELDER: Yeah.

MARTIN: They bring their own football gear. How do they decide who gets to play what character in this re-enactment?

BACHELDER: Yeah. So they gather for a weekend every November around the date of the anniversary and - in a two-and-a-half star chain hotel. And they spend a weekend, and they have very complicated rituals and traditions. And there's a lottery system with Ping-Pong balls with their names on them in which they draw - when your name is drawn, you get to choose which player you are, but there are complicated subrules.

MARTIN: All kinds of rules. You can't be - you can't have the main role two years in a row? Tell me what the rules are.

BACHELDER: I think so - I (laughter).

MARTIN: You can't remember.

BACHELDER: Of course I can't.

MARTIN: (Laughter).

BACHELDER: They're very complicated, these men's rules. But you - I do know the last person to draw is automatically Theismann, so you don't get to choose to be Theismann.

MARTIN: OK.

BACHELDER: And Lawrence Taylor is generally chosen among the first, whether the man wants to be Lawrence Taylor or not. He feels sort of a pressure, I think, to be the hero - or the antihero of the drama.

MARTIN: Who are they? They all seem to have some kind of low-grade disappointment in their lives when they come together. Or is it just bringing them all together brings that out in their conversation? Tell me a little bit about where they're at in their lives.

BACHELDER: Yeah. I think they're just men of a certain age, probably mid-40s, and they've reached a point in their lives when they see what their lives are going to become for better or worse. And I think they've also reached a point where they understand they don't have as much control over their lives as they thought. I think if the play means anything, one of the things it means is that - is the awful contingency and chaos and the sort of dark, catastrophic potential underneath our plans. So I think the men take a certain pleasure - and this might be a religious impulse in some sense - but they take a certain pleasure in perfecting and controlling this play, the very meaning of which is that you can't control, right, or perfect anything. And in that way, they're - it's sort of primitively religious, I think.

MARTIN: It seems that some of their angst - for some of them - comes from parenting. One dad is worried that his young daughter - I think it was - took a fall and he wasn't worried enough about her because he kind of thought she deserved it maybe. Another guy is a bit freaked out because he fantasizes about the adult female characters in the children's books he reads to his kids.

(LAUGHTER)

BACHELDER: You're making this sound more disturbing somehow.

MARTIN: I know, but there's something real about these things that they share with one another. This is a sacred place where they might not be able to divulge this stuff in their regular life. But they get together in this two-star hotel room under the auspices of reliving these rituals and all of a sudden, these men get to just be human.

BACHELDER: Right. And I would think sacred's a great word. There is something sacred about the gathering at the risk of making it sound too grand. I think the men have to fool themselves. They're not going to say - let's all get together, you know. They're not going to say - let's have a spa weekend, or let's have a time to talk together (laughter). So they, in a sense, have fooled themselves. They're coming for the play, they think. But then the thing that they're really doing is, as you say, sharing confidences, sharing anxieties, sharing disappointments and fears.

MARTIN: Yeah.

BACHELDER: But it's almost as if they don't quite know the real reasons why they do this.

MARTIN: What happens to these guys when they go home from this gathering every year? How does this change them, do you think, in their regular lives?

BACHELDER: I think they look forward to it. But I think when they go home, it's back to their normal lives. And I think, to some extent, they don't understand their own contentment. I don't think that their lives are that horrible. They're just coming to terms with what it means to come into middle age.

MARTIN: Just life - you're telling me this is just about all of us kind of just growing up.

BACHELDER: (Laughter) Yeah, you know, I mean, the idea of making a plan - a play - and having the play go wrong is really analogous to parenting, to writing (laughter), to a lot of the things we do.

MARTIN: Chris Bachelder - his new novel is called ""The Throwback Special.""

Chris, thanks so much for talking with us.

BACHELDER: Thanks. It was really a pleasure.

i toggle caption Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist

The reboot of Gilmore Girls means fans will get to see Lorelai and Rory back on the small screen, but it also means the return of another beloved character: the town troubadour, played by Grant-Lee Phillips. Beyond his recurring role on the show, Phillips' musical career has found him performing across decades and genres, both solo and with bands. His latest album under his own name is called The Narrows.

Phillips spoke with NPR's Rachel Martin about what being a troubadour means to him, and how he talks to his daughter about their shared Native American heritage. Hear the radio version at the audio link and read an edited version of their conversation below.

Rachel Martin: So, a troubadour is a storyteller. In that spirit, can you point us to a cut on this album that you think is just a really good story?

Grant-Lee Phillips: Well, I pull stories from history, and I'm always fascinated with family history and lineage. The song ""Moccasin Creek"" is one of those: I venture back to the place where my dad was born in Arkansas, and there's a lyric that goes, ""Go down to the narrows where the water picks up."" That's where the title of this album came from, that part of the river that's treacherous and seeks to pull you under. You have to do all you can to keep your head above water. That's sort of the metaphor  there are times in life like that.

Your previous album, Walking in the Green Corn, was also about your search into your ancestry. Was there a particular point in your life when you started to look at the past and where your family came from, and start to explore questions around that?

I think some of it had to do with becoming a father. I now have an 8-year-old daughter, and when that happened I felt like I wanted to understand where I came from, where our family came from, and be able to provide her with that rooting, you know? So that she could walk into the future knowing just how deep her roots go.

What have you told her about where your family comes from? Because 8 is a particular kind of age, and your family originates from native tribes so the stories may be complicated. How do you tell an 8-year-old that story?



Well, I suppose it's a little bit like drawing: You begin with stick figures, large outlines. And there are a lot of resources these days that are available, you know? Even apps where one can learn some very rudimentary language, some Muskogee words for instance.

So, when she was very young, maybe 5 or 6, we were using those kinds of things: raccoon, wotko. Things like that. It really sticks, too, because kids are little sponges in that way. And we went to powwows together, basically tried to walk through that road of discovery together.

Let's talk about another track off the album, called ""Cry Cry."" We hear in that song some echoes of what we were talking about, themes of Native American history and that family experience. How did this song come together?

YouTube

Well, the Trail of Tears is something that I've been fascinated with for a long time. It's one of those major chapters from our history that we don't encounter in high school, generally speaking. You have to seek it out to understand it. And that idea, being severed from one's home, one's culture and language, all of that  I'm a descendant of those who did walk the Trail of Tears, and living here, in Tennessee, you can see those places where the trail actually wound its way. So it's hard not to put myself in that mindset, trying to imagine what that might have been like.

Another track that caught my eye on the album  even before I played it, just because of the title  is called ""Taking On Weight in Hot Springs."" What's going on in Hot Springs?



I suppose this song is set in another time. It's sort of a road trip  the desire to get off the grid, you know? It feels as though it's in the present, but that present is probably a very sepia-toned kind of place  a place where gangsters would flock to get away from it all.

Do you ever feel like you were born in the wrong era?

Wow, yeah, most certainly. Somehow I was plopped down at the wrong time. Or maybe it's the right time, I'm not sure! Imagery comes from a combination of experience and imagination, all of it. I think in some ways that's sort of what songs do for us. It allows us to have empathy and put ourselves in someone else's skin for a minute.

Is there another song on the album that you think speaks to that empathy?

Yeah. At the end of 2013, shortly after I had moved to Nashville, my dad's health plummeted and he passed away in November of that year. There was a song I was working on and it had remained unfinished, and I completed it in the few hours before he passed. I watched him face his mortality with grace and acceptance, and I wrote the song called ""Smoke and Sparks"" for him.

Did your daughter get to spend much time with your dad?

Just a little bit. Maybe these songs will help her one day to understand all of this.",[]

If you're from New Orleans, you're probably familiar with the Morial family. Two of them have served as mayors of the city. But the story of Sybil Haydel Morial has not been fully told until now.

Sybil Morial is the author of a new memoir, Witness to Change: From Jim Crow to Empowerment, which details her life fighting against segregation and racism in New Orleans.

She may not be as well-known as her son Marc Morial, a former mayor of New Orleans and current head of the National Urban League, or her late husband Ernest ""Dutch"" Morial, the city's first African-American mayor. But her story parallels that of hundreds of other women throughout history, those who played critical roles in this country's important moments, but often stayed behind the scenes.

Sybil Morial writes about her beginnings in the cocoon of the the black middle class, where she was shielded  but never immune  from the degradations of life under segregation. She details her political activism as she got older. In the 1960s and '70s, she started a civic league to register African-Americans to vote, because she couldn't join the League of Women Voters.

Morial spoke with NPR's Michel Martin about how dealing with segregation as a child affected her decisions as an adult.

Interview Highlights

On why she wanted to write a memoir

My memoir was really instigated by Hurricane Katrina. I was displaced, my house flooded. I was displaced and moved to Baton Rouge and was there for eight years before I restored my house. I had flood and then fire and then litigation. So while I lost all of my memorabilia, photographs, papers and little things that remind you of incidents and events, I began to collect my memories in my head. And write them down. And after I had done about 15 events, I thought, I have a book here  I want to do this for my children and grandchildren. So that was the genesis of this memoir.

It was absolutely cathartic for me to be on this level while I was dealing with the tragedies.

Ohio voters head to the polls on Tuesday. Rick Kepler, a retired union worker in Ohio, tells NPR's Rachel Martin why he plans to vote for Bernie Sanders.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Democrats are also in Ohio campaigning. Senator Bernie Sanders is feeling some momentum after his surprise victory over Hillary Clinton in Michigan. Now, he heads to Ohio where some of the same economic issues are driving the conversation there. We're going to hear from one Ohio voter now. He's 66-year-old Rick Kepler, a retired teamster organizer. He told us one of his local unions recently held a mock election. Half of the members supported Donald Trump. The other half, 2 to 1, backed Bernie Sanders. I asked him why Sanders has his vote.

RICK KEPLER: For the first time in my life, I heard a presidential candidate say that it's not the Russians or the Islamists or debt or some other thing that's causing the problems of the working people of this country. He came right out and said what it is. He said it's corporate America. It's Wall Street. It's the 1 percent.

MARTIN: And you don't feel that Hillary Clinton is on the same page.

KEPLER: Well, Bill Clinton was not a very good friend of labor - all those trade agreements, the Glass-Steagall Act and other things that Bill Clinton did. I knew then that they had created a right turn on the Democratic Party, what we call the corporate wing of the Democratic Party. She's campaigning to the left, as all the establishment Democrats do, but I believe that once she's in office, she too will then govern according to the needs of Wall Street before she takes care of the people on Main Street.

MARTIN: Bernie Sanders has been in the halls of Congress for a long time. Have you seen evidence that these are issues he has moved the needle on?

KEPLER: He's been consistently principled on his positions whether it's in foreign affairs or, you know, what he talked about the last debate about what happened in - when Reagan was attacking the common folks in Latin America. And so I think as a Democratic socialist, he's a lot closer to the ideas that I believe in. We do need Medicare for all. It should be a right in this country and not a commodity that can be sold.

MARTIN: But let me ask you about that because this country went through a pretty vicious fight over Obamacare. And the House has repeatedly tried to get it rolled back. So what makes you think a candidate who wants a single-payer system could win in a general election on that kind of platform?

KEPLER: What he's doing is making us take a look at issues the corporate media just hides under the rug. What he's saying is - if you want to see these changes, you better have this political revolution and start talking about this. Don't forget Occupy. They're the first ones who drew attention to the 1 percent, and then they got crushed. But he's resurrected it.

MARTIN: Let me ask you, though. You clearly know the issues. You study the political map, I'm sure, so you know that Bernie Sanders has a tough path to the nomination right now.

KEPLER: Absolutely.

MARTIN: Let's say Hillary Clinton wins the nomination and she's running against Donald Trump. What does that internal calculus look like for you?

KEPLER: We have to support that. We have to make sure Trump does not grab the presidency of the United States of America. Won't be no full-fledged, boy, let's get Hillary in and things will change because we've got a few social issues that she'll stand up for. But when it comes to challenging Wall Street, nope, that's not going to happen.

MARTIN: Rick Kepler, he joined us on the line from his home outside of Akron, Ohio. He is a supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders. Rick, thanks so much for sharing your thoughts with us.

KEPLER: Rachel, thanks for the opportunity.

Somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, there is a bronze chest filled with gold and precious gems. The search for this hidden treasure has become a hobby for some, an obsession for others, and for one recent searcher  a fatal pursuit.

i toggle caption Courtesy of Forrest Fenn Courtesy of Forrest Fenn

The man behind the treasure is Forrest Fenn, an 85-year-old millionaire, former Vietnam fighter pilot, self-taught archaeologist, and successful art dealer in Santa Fe, N.M.

""No one knows where that treasure chest is but me,"" Fenn says. ""If I die tomorrow, the knowledge of that location goes in the coffin with me.""

The ornate, Romanesque box is 10-by-10 inches and weighs about 40 pounds when loaded. Fenn has only revealed that it is hidden in the Rocky Mountains, somewhere between Santa Fe and the Canadian border at an elevation above 5,000 feet. It's not in a mine, a graveyard or near a structure. For further clues, you have to read the poem in his self-published book, The Thrill of the Chase.

Here is one stanza:

Begin it where warm waters halt And take it in the canyon down, Not far, but too far to walk. Put in below the home of Brown.

""'Where warm waters halt,' no one agrees on what that means. Does that mean where two rivers converge? Does that mean where a hot spring pours into a river? Does that mean at the Continental Divide?"" says Sacha Johnston, an avid searcher in Albuquerque. She runs a website that sells Fenn treasure tchotchkes.

Now, six years after publication of the poem, tens of thousands of people have reportedly gone looking for Fenn's treasure, thought to be worth well over a million dollars.

Cheer Folks Up And Go Outside

Fenn sits at his laptop in the study of his Santa Fe manse, his blue eyes twinkling mischievously. He reads emails all day from treasure hunters imploring him for further clues.

""That's the kind of email that I don't respond to,"" he says, ""Because if you want me to give you a clue I'm not going to answer your email.""

i toggle caption Benchmark Maps/Courtesy of Forrest Fenn Benchmark Maps/Courtesy of Forrest Fenn

Surrounding him is his extraordinary collection of Native American artifacts such as Apache dolls, moccasin boots and buffalo skulls.

""I love antiques, particularly American Indian,"" he says.

In the 1990s, he was criticized by Southwestern archaeologists over his excavation of a Pueblo Indian site that he owned. They consider him a plunderer; Fenn thinks they're ""clubby fussbudgets.""

The war over Indian relics has largely subsided. Today, Fenn is all about the treasure. He says he hid the box in the midst of the Great Recession to cheer folks up and to get them off their couches and into the great outdoors.

""Sure, I'm eccentric,"" he says. ""I pride myself on being eccentric. I don't want to go down the center line like a lot of people do.""

The Missing Treasure Hunter ... And The Missing Treasure?

The hunt for the treasure can become an obsession.

Randy Bilyeu was a 54-year-old retired mechanic who had moved from Florida to Colorado to look for the bronze box full time. He was last seen alive on Jan. 5. His car, a raft, and his little dog were found near the Rio Grande south of Santa Fe.

Think you're good at cracking codes? Read Forrest Fenn's poem with clues to the treasure: As I have gone alone in there

And with my treasures bold,

I can keep my secret where,

And hint of riches new and old. Begin it where warm waters halt

And take it in the canyon down,

Not far, but too far to walk.

Put in below the home of Brown. From there it's no place for the meek,

The end is ever drawing nigh;

There'll be no paddle up your creek,

Just heavy loads and water high. If you've been wise and found the blaze,

Look quickly down, your quest to cease,

But tarry scant with marvel gaze,

Just take the chest and go in peace. So why is it that I must go

And leave my trove for all to seek?

The answers I already know,

I've done it tired, and now I'm weak. So hear me all and listen good,

Your effort will be worth the cold.

If you are brave and in the wood

I give you title to the gold.

Fenn is delighted the quest has motivated so many people to discover the Rocky Mountains, but he cautions: ""We don't want to get anybody else lost. Be prepared. Take a GPS. Take at least one other person with you. And wait [until] the snow and the ice melts.""

Is the treasure really worth risking your life over?

Doug Preston is a best-selling author and a longtime friend of Fenn's. He says he saw the chest in the walk-in vault in Fenn's house before he hid it, and Preston can attest that it was filled with gold nuggets, gold coins, pre-Colombian gold figures, rubies, sapphires, emeralds and diamonds.

""As far as proof goes [that he hid the treasure] there's no proof,"" Preston says. He also lives in Santa Fe. ""It's hard to prove a negative. The negative is that the chest is gone. It's not in his house and it's not in his vault. And also knowing Forrest for as long as I have, I can absolutely say with 100 percent confidence that he would never pull off a hoax. I'm absolutely sure that he hid that treasure chest.""

A noted New Mexico archaeologist contacted for this story says he, too, saw the treasure and he also believes Fenn is not a trickster.

The searchers read and re-read the cryptic poem and pore over topographic maps, waiting for the ""aha"" moment. Then they trek through aspen forests, explore riverbanks, and belay down cliff sides looking for the treasure.

""You go out, you look, you don't find it, you come back home, you go through your clues again, your solves again and you think, 'Where did I go wrong?'"" says Cynthia Meachum, a retired high-tech worker in Albuquerque who says she's been out at least 60 times looking for the treasure. ""And you go out and you do it again. And I have actually seen some of the most spectacular scenery because of this that I ever would've seen.""

And for that, Fenn would be pleased.",[]

After a planned rally for Donald Trump was cancelled Friday night, the other GOP candidates are weighing in. NPR Political Correspondent Mara Liasson has a look ahead to the Tuesday primaries.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

For more on this weekend's dramatic events, NPR's national political correspondent, Mara Liasson, joins us. Hi, Mara.

MARA LIASSON, BYLINE: Hi, Rachel.

MARTIN: It doesn't matter your politics, really, watching Americans take swings at one another at political rallies is disconcerting. Frankly, the political environment is scaring a lot of people right now. How did we get to this place?

LIASSON: Well, a lot of people are talking about that. Some Republicans I've talked to agree that the roots of this can be found in a lot of things - the tremendous anger at government that the Tea Party and even the Republican Party, they admit, have stoked, the talk show culture - say anything, demonize your enemy - the stagnating economy, the fear of terrorism. But overall, what Republicans tell me is that the match that lit this fire is Donald Trump. A lot of his supporters are angry, but he's channeled that anger, they say, in a racial direction against Mexicans, against immigrants. He's said from the podium at his rallies, I wish I could punch that protester in the face. He encouraged his supporters to, quote, ""knock the crap out of a protester,"" and promised to pay their legal fees if they did. So there have always been angry voters and protesters, but Trump attracts more of them than anyone else. His supporters feel that the American way of life they knew is slipping away. Protesters feel Donald Trump represents hatred and bigotry. And as we saw over the weekend - they clashed, and it looked like it was spiraling out of control.

MARTIN: So all these protests - is any of this changing the race in any way?

LIASSON: Well, Republican rivals to Trump are blaming him. Ted Cruz said the culture of the - of a campaign is created by the candidate. John Kasich said Trump created a toxic environment. Marco Rubio has said he's acting like a third-world strongman. So they're talking about the demagoguery and the authoritarian, violent rhetoric. They're - tremendous anguish among his rivals. They all promised that they would support him if he was the nominee, but Marco Rubio and John Kasich have now said that despite their pledge, it's getting harder and harder for them to support him if he is the nominee. Now how this affects actual Republican voters is harder to measure. A lot of Trump supporters feel mad that they weren't allowed to hear their candidate. They feel their first American - First Amendment rights were violated in Chicago, so on some level it probably makes them even more ardent supporters of Trump.

MARTIN: Let's look ahead to Tuesday. A lot of big states voting - Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio. Remind us of the stakes.

LIASSON: Stakes are very high. If Trump wins just Ohio and Florida, the two biggest winner-take-all states, he will be unstoppable. Kasich and Rubio, if they don't win their home states, will have a hard time justifying staying in the race. If they can win their home states, Trump could get to the Cleveland convention without the 1,237 delegates needed to be nominated on the first ballot. After the first ballot, as you heard earlier in the show, delegates are unbound. They're free to vote for whoever they want, and the campaigns are already working to make sure they have delegates ready to vote for them if that happens.

MARTIN: NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson. Thanks so much, Mara.

LIASSON: Thank you.

This year's campaign is headed toward an epic clash of Republicanism at the Cleveland convention this Summer. But it's not the first time party has been rocked by turbulence ahead of its convention. Again and again since 1912, splits between establishment GOP figures and the party's most ardent conservatives have hobbled the party's performance in November.

Here's a look at the drama that has come before:

1912

i toggle caption AP AP

Theodore Roosevelt returns four years after leaving the presidency to challenge the man who succeeded him with his blessing: William Howard Taft. Losing at the convention, TR runs as a Progressive, splits the Republican Party and brings about the election of Democrat Woodrow Wilson.

1920

Ten names are placed in nomination at the Chicago convention, but none can get a majority. Ohio Sen. Warren Harding is interviewed by party leaders at 2 a.m. and nominated the next day on the 10th ballot. He wins in November, restoring Republicans to the White House.

i toggle caption AP AP

1928

Herbert Hoover extends GOP dominance into third White House term.

1932

As Great Depression deepens, FDR defeats Hoover in a landslide.

1940

i toggle caption AP AP

Republicans assume they can deny FDR a third term but their convention is split between an Eastern Establishment moderate (Thomas E. Dewey of New York) and a conservative (Robert A. Taft of Ohio, son of the former president). On the sixth ballot, the delegates turn to a third option. He is Wendell Willkie of Indiana, a public utility executive with no political experience who has risen in polls despite have entered no primaries. Willkie loses to FDR in an Electoral College landslide.

1948

Dewey, who had been the nominee in 1944 (losing to FDR), returns as the frontrunner. But he is once again opposed by Taft, the champion of the party's hardcore conservatives. It takes three ballots, but Dewey prevails, frustrating Taft's loyalists. In November, Dewey is upset by a resurgent Harry Truman, who has been president since FDR's death in 1945.

1952

i toggle caption AP AP

Taft forces come to Chicago confident their turn has come. But the Eastern Establishment has found a new hero, a war hero, in Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, who has been serving as president of Columbia University in New York. The convention begins with a series of fights over rules and credentials, most of them regarding delegates from the South. Eisenhower came up a few votes shy during the first ballot, but a shift away from a third candidate broke a near-tie and frustrated the Taft faction once more.

1960

Ike's vice president, Richard Nixon, had the votes to be nominated but there were two high-profile ""favorite son"" candidates: New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller and Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater. These inheritors of the Dewey-Taft rivalry both stepped aside for Nixon. ""Let's grow up, conservatives,"" said Goldwater. ""If we want to take this party back  and I think we can someday  let's get to work."" Nixon lost narrowly in November to Democrat John F. Kennedy.

1964

i toggle caption AP AP

Goldwater's ""someday"" comes in the very next cycle, as his wins in key primaries in the West unhorse Rockefeller and the Eastern Establishment. Rockefeller leads a walkout from the convention and Goldwater's acceptance speech declares war on moderates. Goldwater loses 44 states in November.

1968

Nixon unites the party factions well before the convention, turning back an eleventh hour bid from California Gov. Ronald Reagan. Nixon then wins one term narrowly and a second in a 49-state landslide before resigning in disgrace in 1974 after the Watergate scandal.

1976

Reagan returns to challenge incumbent President Gerald R. Ford (Nixon's vice president) for the nomination, reviving the Dewey-Taft wars of a generation earlier. With a late surge in Southern and Western primaries, Reagan cuts Ford's lead. But his attempt to break the convention open with rules changes comes up short by 111 votes. Ford wins on first ballot but loses in fall to Democrat Jimmy Carter.

1980

Reagan loses Iowa to moderate George W. Bush, but wins New Hampshire, wraps up nomination in May and takes Bush as running mate. Reagan serves two terms, winning the second with 49 states.

1988

Explicitly religious conservatives emerge as a major bloc, but Bush holds off a big field of primary challengers. Dividing the votes of conservatives, Bush wins on first ballot and takes 40 states in November.

1992

i toggle caption Doug Mills/AP Doug Mills/AP

Incensed by Bush's acceptance of tax increases in a budget deal, Patrick Buchanan challenges his renomination. Summoning the spirits of Taft, Goldwater and Reagan, Buchanan still fails to block a second Bush nomination but weakens the incumbent. Billionaire Ross Perot runs as an independent on Bush's right, helping Democrat Bill Clinton win with just 42 percent of the popular vote.

1996

Buchanan again leads the charge from the right, but several others split the conservative bloc and insider Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader who was Ford's running mate 20 years earlier, wraps up the nomination in March. He loses to Clinton in November.

2000

Once again a large field forms with ten early candidates vying for the votes of ""movement conservatives."" Establishment voters coalesce around Texas Gov. George W. Bush, forcing out ""maverick"" challenger John McCain by the second week of March. Bush loses the popular vote to Vice President Al Gore but wins the Electoral College after the Supreme Court shuts down a recount in Florida.

2008

McCain returns and dispatches rival Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York, early in the Establishment lane. Again there are ten early contenders for the conservative mantle, but most drop either before or after the first primaries. Baptist minister Mike Huckabee is the last of them, withdrawing in early March. McCain names a conservative favorite, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, as his running mate. Their ticket gets less than a third of the Electoral College vote.

2012

i toggle caption Jae C. Hong/AP Jae C. Hong/AP

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney renews his 2008 bid, this time as an insider favorite more than a conservative option. He easily dispatches other contenders to his left while more than half a dozen conservatives take turns leading in the polls. One, former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, wins Iowa and extends the struggle into May before conceding. Restive conservatives at the convention in Tampa are only partially placated by the choice of Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan as running mate.",[]

i toggle caption Courtesy of the artist Courtesy of the artist

The reboot of Gilmore Girls means fans will get to see Lorelai and Rory back on the small screen, but it also means the return of another beloved character: the town troubadour, played by Grant-Lee Phillips. Beyond his recurring role on the show, Phillips' musical career has found him performing across decades and genres, both solo and with bands. His latest album under his own name is called The Narrows.

Phillips spoke with NPR's Rachel Martin about what being a troubadour means to him, and how he talks to his daughter about their shared Native American heritage. Hear the radio version at the audio link and read an edited version of their conversation below.

Rachel Martin: So, a troubadour is a storyteller. In that spirit, can you point us to a cut on this album that you think is just a really good story?

Grant-Lee Phillips: Well, I pull stories from history, and I'm always fascinated with family history and lineage. The song ""Moccasin Creek"" is one of those: I venture back to the place where my dad was born in Arkansas, and there's a lyric that goes, ""Go down to the narrows where the water picks up."" That's where the title of this album came from, that part of the river that's treacherous and seeks to pull you under. You have to do all you can to keep your head above water. That's sort of the metaphor  there are times in life like that.

Your previous album, Walking in the Green Corn, was also about your search into your ancestry. Was there a particular point in your life when you started to look at the past and where your family came from, and start to explore questions around that?

I think some of it had to do with becoming a father. I now have an 8-year-old daughter, and when that happened I felt like I wanted to understand where I came from, where our family came from, and be able to provide her with that rooting, you know? So that she could walk into the future knowing just how deep her roots go.

What have you told her about where your family comes from? Because 8 is a particular kind of age, and your family originates from native tribes so the stories may be complicated. How do you tell an 8-year-old that story?



Well, I suppose it's a little bit like drawing: You begin with stick figures, large outlines. And there are a lot of resources these days that are available, you know? Even apps where one can learn some very rudimentary language, some Muskogee words for instance.

So, when she was very young, maybe 5 or 6, we were using those kinds of things: raccoon, wotko. Things like that. It really sticks, too, because kids are little sponges in that way. And we went to powwows together, basically tried to walk through that road of discovery together.

Let's talk about another track off the album, called ""Cry Cry."" We hear in that song some echoes of what we were talking about, themes of Native American history and that family experience. How did this song come together?

YouTube

Well, the Trail of Tears is something that I've been fascinated with for a long time. It's one of those major chapters from our history that we don't encounter in high school, generally speaking. You have to seek it out to understand it. And that idea, being severed from one's home, one's culture and language, all of that  I'm a descendant of those who did walk the Trail of Tears, and living here, in Tennessee, you can see those places where the trail actually wound its way. So it's hard not to put myself in that mindset, trying to imagine what that might have been like.

Another track that caught my eye on the album  even before I played it, just because of the title  is called ""Taking On Weight in Hot Springs."" What's going on in Hot Springs?



I suppose this song is set in another time. It's sort of a road trip  the desire to get off the grid, you know? It feels as though it's in the present, but that present is probably a very sepia-toned kind of place  a place where gangsters would flock to get away from it all.

Do you ever feel like you were born in the wrong era?

Wow, yeah, most certainly. Somehow I was plopped down at the wrong time. Or maybe it's the right time, I'm not sure! Imagery comes from a combination of experience and imagination, all of it. I think in some ways that's sort of what songs do for us. It allows us to have empathy and put ourselves in someone else's skin for a minute.

Is there another song on the album that you think speaks to that empathy?

Yeah. At the end of 2013, shortly after I had moved to Nashville, my dad's health plummeted and he passed away in November of that year. There was a song I was working on and it had remained unfinished, and I completed it in the few hours before he passed. I watched him face his mortality with grace and acceptance, and I wrote the song called ""Smoke and Sparks"" for him.

Did your daughter get to spend much time with your dad?

Just a little bit. Maybe these songs will help her one day to understand all of this.",[]
npr.org,2016-03-13 00:00:00,"No Paper Tiger, This 'Menagerie' Is Full Of Fierce Feeling",[],"No Paper Tiger, This 'Menagerie' Is Full Of Fierce Feeling

There is a righteous, deep-felt fury I sometimes experience when reading stupendously good work. How dare you, I shout at the author, dropping the book, pacing for a while, how dare you make me feel so much. I rant on Twitter. I joke about how the author must be stopped.

I have done all those things elsewhere and am left hollowed out. Ken Liu's The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories is a book from which I staggered away, dazed, unable to speak. I have wrestled with how to review it, circled my metaphors like a wary cat, and finally abandoned the enterprise of trying to live up to its accomplishment. I will be honest, and blunt, because this is a book that has scoured me of language and insight and left itself rattling around inside the shell of me.

I have never been so moved by a collection of short fiction. I was at times afraid to read more. Every single story struck chords in me profound enough to hurt, whether about the love and cruelty of families; the melancholy of thermodynamics; the vicious unfairness of history and the humbling grace with which people endure its weight. Stories so often take us out of ourselves; Liu's stories went deep into my marrow, laying bare painful truths, meticulously slicing through the layers of pearl to find the grain of sand at its heart.

I'd read some of these pieces when they made their first appearances in magazines: the much-lauded ""The Paper Menagerie"" in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, ""Good Hunting"" in two parts on Strange Horizons. Liu's stories always impressed me; so did his novel, The Grace of Kings. But this collection is so much more than the sum of its parts that the phrase loses all meaning. Selected from more than seventy stories published over the course of twelve years, these fifteen are strands of silk woven into a spider's web, or precise folds compressing an enormous decade-spanning oeuvre into something one can hold with two hands.

I have never been so moved by a collection of short fiction. I was at times afraid to read more.

In ""State Change"" a girl is born with an ice cube for a soul, and lives her life trying to keep it from melting. In ""The Regular,"" a private detective hunts a serial killer while wrestling with her private grief and the toll it has taken on her mechanically enhanced body. In ""All the Flavours"" a little girl in 1870s Idaho meets a man who might be the red-faced god of war, and listens to his stories. The final story  appropriately named ""The Man Who Ended History: A Documentary""  is a harrowing meditation on nations, memory, responsibility, and to whom the past can rightly be said to belong.

""For me,"" says Liu in his preface to the collection, ""all fiction is about prizing the logic of metaphors  which is the logic of narratives in general  over reality, which is irreducibly random and senseless."" This is the organizing principle of The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories, the one that drives me to grasp at pearls, and silk, and paper folds in an attempt to convey my experience of reading it. I almost want to review the preface alone. It is simultaneously a statement of purpose, a map, and a key.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge, writing in his Notebooks, once asked and answered the following question:

Why do you make a book? Because my Hands can extend but a few score Inches from my Body ... but think only of the thoughts, feelings, radical Impulse that have been implanted in how many thousands of thousands by the little Ballad of the Children in the Wood! The Sphere of Alexander the great's Agency is trifling compared with it.

Cutting across history and biology, physics and folk tales, why do you make a book is the question at the heart of this work, inseparable from what is a book and how is a book. Storytelling  whether in oral or written tradition, along family or national lines, private musing or public record  is the means of digesting, communicating, understanding histories and experiences too vast to encompass.

Whether in a letter written from a mother to her son, an alien history scratched on the surface of an irradiated planet, or myths of origin transforming to keep up with humanity's phase-shifting, stories are the language we speak to each other. In A Paper Menagerie and Other Stories, Liu speaks it with devastating eloquence.

Bernie Sanders was able to win in Michigan, upsetting Hillary Clinton, with the support of white men. (NPR's Tamara Keith laid that out in this post this morning). Sanders won 62% of white men in the Michigan Democratic primary, while Clinton won 68% of black voters. That is a big share, but wasn't enough  and certainly smaller than the margins she's gotten among black voters in Southern states.

Looking at that difference, between white men and black voters, the chart shows where Sanders and Clinton might have their best shots in states going forward with significant delegate hauls. This analysis is based on 2008 exit polls and takes the difference between what white men were as a share of the electorate as compared to black voters.

A couple notes:

-No exit polls were conducted in Washington state in 2008, but it probably looks similar to Oregon. Census data shows Washington state has a marginally higher African-American population.

-Hispanics were not factored into this analysis, and they will certainly make a difference in California, Arizona and Florida. Clinton won a large share of Latinos in Texas, though Sanders split with her in Nevada, according to exit polls. Sanders also won Colorado, a state with a large Latino population, though no entrance or exit polls were conducted at those caucuses.",[]

When most people want to play a game, the first thing they reach for is likely a smartphone or tablet. Actual pinball machines have become quaint curiosities, but a father-son duo in California is keeping these old-school games alive in a museum.

The Museum of Pinball is hidden away in an old industrial building, just off Interstate 10 and about 90 miles east of Los Angeles in Banning, Calif. It's pretty quiet when the rows upon rows of pinball machines are not turned on. But once the switch is flipped, it gets loud.

""I built this collection picking them up one by one, and I put them in my house,"" says John Weeks, who founded the museum together with his son, Johnathan Weeks. ""I'd fill up buildings with them, storage units.""

Their collection is huge. There are 650 games ranging from vintage 1950s-era machines all the way up to ones based on current TV shows such as The Walking Dead. John began amassing the games in the early 1980s.

i toggle caption Matt Guilhem/KVCR Matt Guilhem/KVCR

At first, he thought of opening a bar with an arcade, but that would only allow a handful of the collection to be played at any given time. The benefit of the museum is that all the machines are out on display. But Johnathan explains there is a drawback.

""You gotta remember when the museum is so large and there's so many games plugged in,"" he says. ""Just to flip the breakers is thousands of dollars to turn it on for the day.""

That means the museum is only open a few times a year. During a recent rare opening, Dolores Barrett was trying her hand at it.

""I've really never played pinball. But I started out by playing The Terminator, and now I'm hooked,"" she says.

Although she's old enough to have grown up with pinball, Barrett says her parents never let her have a quarter to play as a kid. Now, she's making up for lost time.

On a different aisle of old timey machines, Jamie Vanderet is playing one called Sea Ray. He's here from Ottawa and says he picked up the game at a bar back in Canada.

""Once you start to play, you kind of get the bug,"" he says.

When he was a kid, pinball and arcades were already starting to fade. He says it's not nostalgia drawing him to the games.

""There's just something about like the lights and colors, especially with the older machines,"" he says.

Vanderet thinks it has something to do with the physicality of the real machines.

""I have played versions on the iPad and on the computer and stuff, it's not nearly the same thing as playing it in the flesh. I mean, the machines all have their own quirks that you don't really get into when you're playing a digital version,"" he says. ""It doesn't quite match. Not even close.""

Quietly tapping a screen is one way to play a game, but as Barrett discovers, shouting and celebrating with each click of the flipper and bounce of the pinball  surrounded by audience  is more fun.

""Oh my goodness, I'm doing this. I can't believe it. I can't believe this!"" Barrett says.",[]

When an assisted living home in California shut down last fall, many of its residents were left behind, with nowhere to go.

The staff at the Valley Springs Manor left when they stopped getting paid  except for cook Maurice Rowland and Miguel Alvarez, the janitor.

""There was about 16 residents left behind, and we had a conversation in the kitchen, 'What are we going to do?' "" Rowland says.

""If we left, they wouldn't have nobody,"" the 34-year-old Alvarez says.

Their roles quickly transformed for the elderly residents, who needed round-the-clock care.

""I would only go home for one hour, take a shower, get dressed, then be there for 24-hour days,"" says Alvarez.

Rowland, 35, remembers passing out medications during those long days. He says he didn't want to leave the residents  some coping with dementia  to fend for themselves.

""I just couldn't see myself going home  next thing you know, they're in the kitchen trying to cook their own food and burn the place down,"" Rowland says. ""Even though they wasn't our family, they were kind of like our family for this short period of time.""

For Alvarez, the situation brought back memories from his childhood.

""My parents, when they were younger, they left me abandoned,"" he says. ""Knowing how they are going to feel, I didn't want them to go through that.""

Alvarez and Rowland spent several days caring for the elderly residents of Valley Springs Manor until the fire department and sheriff took over.

The incident led to legislation in California known as the Residential Care for the Elderly Reform Act of 2014.

""If I would've left, I think that would have been on my conscience for a very long time,"" says Rowland.

Rachel Martin speaks with Chris Bachelder. His novel tells the story of a group of friends who gather each year to re-enact the gruesome injury sustain by quarterback Joe Theisman.

RACHEL MARTIN, HOST:

Football fans of a certain age can still recall with horror a particular moment during a ""Monday Night Football"" game in 1985. Washington quarterback Joe Theismann ran a play called the flea flicker, and it left him wide open to the hard-charging linebacker of the New York Giants, Lawrence Taylor.

(SOUNDBITE OF ""MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL"")

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: And it was Lawrence Taylor who slammed Theismann to the ground at the 42-yard line. The blitz was on. That's not necessarily a good play to have called. And quickly, Lawrence Taylor is up saying Theismann is hurt.

MARTIN: Yeah. Theismann was really hurt. His right leg snapped in two. His football career ended that night. This moment frozen in sports history is at the heart of a new novel by Chris Bachelder. It's called ""The Throwback Special,"" and it's a surprisingly funny and poignant story about a group of friends who reunite every year to re-enact that play and then reflect on their middle-aged lives in the process. Chris Bachelder joins us from member station WVXU in Cincinnati.

Chris, welcome to the program.

CHRIS BACHELDER: Thank you. It's my pleasure.

MARTIN: When did you first see this football play happen? Were you old enough to have watched it when it actually occurred (laughter)?

BACHELDER: Yes, I was. I was 14, I think, in 1985.

MARTIN: Yeah.

BACHELDER: And those games were on at 9, and I usually watched at least the first half and this happened early in the second quarter, so I saw it.

MARTIN: So I hadn't seen it. And so I had to go watch it, you know, in preparation for having this conversation with you. And I don't know if it was just the clip I found on YouTube, but the - at the first look at it, just the camera angle, didn't show it. You know, you just see Lawrence Taylor, L.T., like, holding his helmet, and clearly, he's upset and something bad has transpired. And then they're, like, let's go to the reverse angle cam and then they play it again. This is horrible.

BACHELDER: It's awful, and I'm sorry to introduce you to it. But it's - yeah, it's just awful.

MARTIN: So this clearly stayed with you for many years. How in the world did you come up with this conceit to use this event as the fulcrum around which to build a novel about these guys?

BACHELDER: You know, it was a kind of slow and gradual process. I think I originally thought the power was in the play itself. And there's plenty of power there, but the kind of literary power or energy that I was feeling had to do more with that play plus time - plus 25 or 30 years. So when you bring nostalgia into the mix - when you bring a sort of middle-aged man into the mix, reflecting on the play, you have two times existing together. The play was my context, not my subject.

MARTIN: These guys - these characters in your book help us set the scene. Every year they get together in his hotel - it's the same hotel every year?

BACHELDER: Yeah.

MARTIN: They bring their own football gear. How do they decide who gets to play what character in this re-enactment?

BACHELDER: Yeah. So they gather for a weekend every November around the date of the anniversary and - in a two-and-a-half star chain hotel. And they spend a weekend, and they have very complicated rituals and traditions. And there's a lottery system with Ping-Pong balls with their names on them in which they draw - when your name is drawn, you get to choose which player you are, but there are complicated subrules.

MARTIN: All kinds of rules. You can't be - you can't have the main role two years in a row? Tell me what the rules are.

BACHELDER: I think so - I (laughter).

MARTIN: You can't remember.

BACHELDER: Of course I can't.

MARTIN: (Laughter).

BACHELDER: They're very complicated, these men's rules. But you - I do know the last person to draw is automatically Theismann, so you don't get to choose to be Theismann.

MARTIN: OK.

BACHELDER: And Lawrence Taylor is generally chosen among the first, whether the man wants to be Lawrence Taylor or not. He feels sort of a pressure, I think, to be the hero - or the antihero of the drama.

MARTIN: Who are they? They all seem to have some kind of low-grade disappointment in their lives when they come together. Or is it just bringing them all together brings that out in their conversation? Tell me a little bit about where they're at in their lives.

BACHELDER: Yeah. I think they're just men of a certain age, probably mid-40s, and they've reached a point in their lives when they see what their lives are going to become for better or worse. And I think they've also reached a point where they understand they don't have as much control over their lives as they thought. I think if the play means anything, one of the things it means is that - is the awful contingency and chaos and the sort of dark, catastrophic potential underneath our plans. So I think the men take a certain pleasure - and this might be a religious impulse in some sense - but they take a certain pleasure in perfecting and controlling this play, the very meaning of which is that you can't control, right, or perfect anything. And in that way, they're - it's sort of primitively religious, I think.

MARTIN: It seems that some of their angst - for some of them - comes from parenting. One dad is worried that his young daughter - I think it was - took a fall and he wasn't worried enough about her because he kind of thought she deserved it maybe. Another guy is a bit freaked out because he fantasizes about the adult female characters in the children's books he reads to his kids.

(LAUGHTER)

BACHELDER: You're making this sound more disturbing somehow.

MARTIN: I know, but there's something real about these things that they share with one another. This is a sacred place where they might not be able to divulge this stuff in their regular life. But they get together in this two-star hotel room under the auspices of reliving these rituals and all of a sudden, these men get to just be human.

BACHELDER: Right. And I would think sacred's a great word. There is something sacred about the gathering at the risk of making it sound too grand. I think the men have to fool themselves. They're not going to say - let's all get together, you know. They're not going to say - let's have a spa weekend, or let's have a time to talk together (laughter). So they, in a sense, have fooled themselves. They're coming for the play, they think. But then the thing that they're really doing is, as you say, sharing confidences, sharing anxieties, sharing disappointments and fears.

MARTIN: Yeah.

BACHELDER: But it's almost as if they don't quite know the real reasons why they do this.

MARTIN: What happens to these guys when they go home from this gathering every year? How does this change them, do you think, in their regular lives?

BACHELDER: I think they look forward to it. But I think when they go home, it's back to their normal lives. And I think, to some extent, they don't understand their own contentment. I don't think that their lives are that horrible. They're just coming to terms with what it means to come into middle age.

MARTIN: Just life - you're telling me this is just about all of us kind of just growing up.

BACHELDER: (Laughter) Yeah, you know, I mean, the idea of making a plan - a play - and having the play go wrong is really analogous to parenting, to writing (laughter), to a lot of the things we do.

MARTIN: Chris Bachelder - his new novel is called ""The Throwback Special.""

Chris, thanks so much for talking with us.

BACHELDER: Thanks. It was really a pleasure.

The capital of Turkey was struck by a large explosion on Sunday; the death toll is at least 27, and at least 75 people have been injured, according to the Ankara governor's office.

The blast, which media reports suggest may have been a car bomb, struck near a central square in Ankara. It hit a transportation hub with several bus stations, NPR's Peter Kenyon reports from Istanbul.

""Rescue crews scrambled to account for the dead and wounded among the travelers returning from weekend trips,"" Peter told our Newscast unit.

No organization has yet claimed responsibility for the deadly attack.

Just a month ago, a bombing in Ankara killed 29 people and injured more than 60. Istanbul, Turkey's capital, has also been struck by several explosions in recent months.

""Officials have blamed supporters of the Islamic state, Kurdish militants from the PKK and extreme leftist groups for various attacks inside Turkey,"" Peter says.

Peter also notes that Turkey's media watchdog has banned media coverage of Sunday's explosion  ""but several channels continued to broadcast live from the scene,"" he says.",[]

Speaking on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday morning, presidential front-runner Donald Trump told host Chuck Todd that he doesn't accept responsibility for violence at his rallies.

He repeatedly said he ""doesn't condone violence,"" while indicating that he might cover the legal fees of a supporter of his who punched a protester in the face.

Todd played clips of Trump speaking to crowds and expressing support for violent actions.

""I love the old days, you know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this? They'd be carried out in a stretcher, folks,"" Trump had said of one protester. Then: ""I'd like to punch him in the face, I'll tell you.""

After Todd played that clip, Trump said that he did not condone violence, and does not accept responsibility for any atmosphere of violence at his rallies.

At an earlier rally, Trump had said to his supporters: ""If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. Okay? Just knock the hell  I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees.""

Trump told Todd that then, too, he was not condoning violence.

He repeatedly brought up the idea of self-defense.

As an example, explaining why he called on supporters to ""knock the crap"" out of anyone with tomatoes, he said: ""If you get hit in the face with a tomato, let me tell you, with somebody with a strong arm at least, let me tell you, it can be very damaging.

""If people are there doing harm, you have to go and you have to use equal force.""

He also said that the young man who was sucker-punched in North Carolina had been ""taunting,"" ""loud"" and ""disruptive,"" and was holding up his middle finger  ""a terrible thing to do.""

The man who punched him, Trump said, ""got carried away, he was 78 years old, he obviously loves this country, and maybe he doesn't like seeing what's happening to the country.""

Trump, who insisted yet again he does not condone violence, had instructed his people to ""look into"" the possibility of paying the man's legal bills, he said.

Nearly a year after a Germanwings co-pilot deliberately crashed an Airbus in the Alps, French investigators have released recommendations for world aviation bodies on how to avoid such an incident in the future.

The BEA investigation agency suggests, among other things, clearer guidelines for when doctors should set aside doctor-patient confidentiality for the sake of public safety and more flexibility for pilots to receive mental health treatment while continuing to fly.

The air accident investigators say that Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot who crashed the plane on March 24, 2015, had received a medical certificate declaring him able to fly in 2008. But in 2014 and early 2015, the pilot developed symptoms that ""could be compatible with a psychotic depressive episode,"" Arnaud Desjardin of the BEA said at a press conference Sunday.

""Several private physicians had the information that the copilot was ill; some knew he was flying,"" Desjardin said through an interpreter. ""But this information did not reach the airworthiness authorities, and did not reach his employer.""

In fact, The Associated Press reports, Lubitz had consulted ""dozens of doctors"" in the weeks leading up to the crash  one of whom referred him to a psychiatric clinic. None of them reached out to authorities.

Under existing regulations, Desjardin says, it was Lubitz's responsibility to self-declare that he was struggling.

""This he did not do,"" Desjardin said.

In March of last year, Lubitz took control of the Airbus A320 when the pilot went to the restroom. Lubitz then locked the door to the cockpit. As the pilot pounded on the door and shouted to be let in, Lubitz set the altitude setting to its lowest option, steered the plane towards a mountainside and accelerated.

The resulting crash killed all 150 people on board.

BEA's investigation into the crash is separate from an investigation by French prosecutors, the AP notes. Where the prosecutors are looking to build a possible criminal case, BEA was looking for methods of preventing such crashes in the future.

One factor they identified: Doctors' concerns about violating Germany's strict confidentiality laws. While doctors are allowed to share otherwise-private information about patients for safety reasons, the fear of losing their jobs for a misjudged disclosure can keep information from being shared.

""BEA requests definition of clear rules to require health care providers to inform the authorities when a specific patient's health is very likely to impact public safety,"" Desjardin said.

Meanwhile, pilots also worry about losing their jobs if they reveal they are experiencing mental health issues. BEA recommends peer support programs to help pilots facing stigma about mental health  and allowing pilots to continue to fly while taking some antidepressants, to reduce the risk to a pilot's career if he or she discloses mental health issues.",[]

i toggle caption Gerry Broome/AP Gerry Broome/AP

Call it Mega Tuesday. Only Super Tuesday (March 1) had more delegates at stake on a single day than the upcoming contests on Tuesday. More than 1,000 delegates are up for grabs  and the results will be pivotal.

The biggest prizes on the GOP side are the winner-take-all states of Florida and Ohio. On the Democratic side, which still awards delegates proportionally, it's Florida and Illinois, followed by Ohio.

What's at stake for Republicans?

If Donald Trump sweeps the winner-take-all states of Ohio and Florida, it could be a wrap party for his nomination as the Republican standard-bearer.

To be clear, Trump won't mathematically clinch Tuesday even with wins in both places. But the odds that anyone else could go into the convention with a majority  or even most  of the delegates would be almost impossible. It will mean the only way Trump wouldn't be the nominee is if he's stopped at a historic and chaotic brokered convention.

As it stands now, Trump is favored in both Florida and Ohio, but Marco Rubio and John Kasich are hoping their respective home states put them over the top. There is some evidence of momentum for Kasich in Ohio, where he's a popular governor. One poll showed him in the lead this past week. Rubio's campaign is even telling people to vote for Kasich in Ohio, following a plan laid out by Mitt Romney designed to try and stop Trump from getting a majority before the convention.

Florida has been trending the other direction, with Trump favored. Rubio is running zero ads, and Ted Cruz has made a late play in the state. If Rubio loses Florida, it's likely lights out for his campaign. If Kasich loses Ohio, his chances of winning the nomination are severely diminished from what's already something unlikely to happen. It could also be the end of his candidacy, considering the next contest where he could contest wouldn't be for three weeks in Wisconsin.

Side note: Don't overlook the contests in Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, which, combined, actually have more delegates than Florida and Ohio put together. Since they are not winner-take-all, though, no one is going to net the margins there that they could in either Florida or Ohio.

What's at stake for Democrats?

These are the first major contests following Bernie Sanders' surprise win over Hillary Clinton in Michigan. It was apparently the biggest polling upset in history. It also showed Sanders can win in a big, diverse state.

But it didn't change one thing  the math. Clinton remains the favorite for the nomination because of her delegate lead and because Democrats award delegates on a proportional basis. Despite the potentially narrative-changing win in Michigan, Sanders woke up further behind, because Clinton had won such a huge margin in Mississippi. Sanders now needs 54 percent of remaining pledged delegates for a pledged-delegate majority. With superdelegates factored in, he needs 60 percent.

Math aside, Tuesday is important, though. If Sanders can pull off more surprise wins in these big states, Clinton will look vulnerable. Superdelegates could switch their allegiance, and Clinton will have her back against the wall. The last thing she wants is to limp to the nomination. She needs to show strength Tuesday.

Sanders believes, after Michigan, that his message on trade has resonance in the Upper Midwest, meaning states like Illinois and Ohio could line up well for him.

One thing already appears clear, however  no one on either side is going to get a majority of delegates for months.

Key Questions Answered About Mega Tuesday

How many delegates are at stake? 1,058 pledged delegates for Republicans and Democrats combined. If the 102 unpledged delegates, or superdelegates, are added in, the total rises to 1,160.

How many states? Five, plus one territory: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Illinois, Missouri and the Northern Mariana Islands (on the Republican side; the islands vote Saturday for Democrats).

Why is March 15 a big deal? It could be decisive for both parties. Also, not only are there a lot of delegates at stake, but it's also the day when the contest rules change for the Republicans. States can start to pick how they want to award their delegates. For both Florida and Ohio, that means winner-take-all.

What's happened since Super Tuesday? A lot!

March 5 and 6:

Democrats: Sanders won the caucuses in Maine, Kansas and Nebraska. Clinton won by a huge margin in the Louisiana primary.

GOP: Cruz won the most delegates with wins in Kansas and Maine. Trump pulled off narrow victories in Louisiana and Kentucky. Rubio won the Republican primary in Puerto Rico Sunday by more than 50 percent of the vote, giving him all 23 delegates (which, by the way, is as many delegates as in New Hampshire).

March 8:

Democrats: Sanders won Michigan after going into the primary polling way behind Clinton. Clinton won Mississippi by 60 points and gave her the most delegates that day despite Sanders' narrative-changing Michigan win.

GOP: Trump won Hawaii, Michigan and Mississippi; Cruz won Idaho; Marco Rubio didn't score double digits in Mississippi or Michigan and placed third in Hawaii and Idaho.

What is the current delegate count?

Republicans:

Trump 459

Cruz 360

Rubio 152

Kasich 54

Democrats:

Clinton 1,223 total (762 pledged + 461 superdelegates)

Sanders 574 total (549 pledged + 25 superdelegates)

Donald Trump's planned rally in Chicago Friday was canceled, but not before ugly scenes played out between Trump supporters and people who had come to protest the event.

Jedidiah Brown was there. He was the young man who was shown on television yelling as he was pulled from the event stage. He's part of an organization called Young Leaders Alliance.

""Having gotten into the middle of the rally, I completely felt hated, I completely felt unsafe, I felt completely uncomfortable,"" Brown tells NPR's Rachel Martin. ""And I knew that if this is what I felt, when I saw what they were doing to other people, I couldn't imagine what others felt. So it became my mission to shut this down because this can't go on in Chicago.""

The Trump campaign cited the safety ""of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena,"" in a statement announcing the cancellation. On Saturday, Trump blamed the unrest on ""professional protesters"" and ""thugs"" in the crowd.

It was the latest incident in a series of violent incidents between Trump supporters and anti-Trump protesters that have played out at rallies across the country.

Brown says attendees at the Chicago rally directed racist statements at him. ""They were calling us the 'n' word, they told me to go back to Africa,"" he says. ""And they would call us all kinds of things and even say to us things that they would do to us. 'Boy, if I had the chance, I would get you and give you a good whipping, boy.' ... That kind of stuff I just couldn't believe could still exist in America in 2016.""

Brown rushed the stage but was immediately grabbed by security. ""I went up there for two reasons,"" he says. ""Number one: Shut this down. And number two: Get the right message out in our city: America is already great  without the hate.""

He says people who identified themselves as Secret Service took him off stage and let him back into the crowd, but things got worse. Someone threw a water bottle at him, Brown says, and another person put him in a headlock. He says he took a swing back at that person but Secret Service pulled him down and he was later taken into custody by University of Illinois at Chicago police.

He thinks protests like his may be having two reactions from Trump supporters: They either double down on their backing of Trump, or they begin to change their minds.

""I think that some people are more committed now,"" Brown says. ""I think that they feel like this is an avenue to express how they really feel about people like myself that are black. People that are Muslim  for women. I feel like they feel empowered to do whatever they want to do.""

But he says people who are still wavering may have a different reaction. ""I think that some people are realizing  'Wait a minute. This isn't what we want. This isn't where we're going. It's not what I'm about.' So I think we've seen minds change on both perspectives.""",[]

MARTIN: True.

CARBONE: So that's what I did. But in 2009, I was given my first spoiler. It was about the ending of Jason's season where I said hey, he chose Melissa at the finale, but they have since broken up, and he's been dating Molly. And you're going to see that. And nobody bought that because it was just, like, that's way too out there. What does this guy know? He's never given us a spoiler. And then it happened and then it's like - oh.

MARTIN: Wow. Do you feel, like, a certain amount of power associated with this whole thing?

CARBONE: I'm very well-aware of how big the site is and how big the show is with a rabid amount of fans. But I know what I do is - I'm not curing cancer here. I mean, I'm giving spoilers to a TV show.

MARTIN: Do you like the show? I mean, yeah, it's an easy target. It's easy to make fun of it. There are a lot of things that are abhorrent about it. But clearly, if you're spending all this time thinking about this show, watching the show - is there something about it you like?

CARBONE: I don't care about the show. If I wasn't making my living off this show, would I watch it? Absolutely not. What I like about the show is I like spoiling it. I enjoyed the fact that I'm a one-man operation in Dallas, Texas, that is literally spoiling a network television show watched by 8 million people every week. I get a thrill out of that, yeah.

When Bernie Sanders won the primary in Michigan last week, it shook up the narrative of the Democratic race.

Sanders did so with the help of white men. If he's able to pull off a victory in Ohio, the same demographic will likely be key.

Take Jim, who describes himself, only half jokingly, as an angry white man.

""We're pissed off,"" Jim said. (Jim's asked that his last name be withheld because his union, AFSCME, has endorsed Hillary Clinton, and he supports Sanders. He can't be quoted publicly going against his union.) ""We haven't gotten raises. Our pensions have been cut. Our healthcare's increased.""

And, Jim added, Sanders speaks to that. ""Bernie, he speaks from the trenches,"" Jim said. ""We feel that he's fighting for us.""

In Michigan, Sanders won with the support of 62 percent of white men, who were one-in-three voters, according to exit polls. In 2008, in the Democratic primary in Ohio, white men turned out in strikingly similar proportions to this year's Michigan contest.

At the same time, black voters could make up a smaller proportion of the electorate and likely won't be enough to put Clinton over the top. In Michigan, Clinton won more than two-thirds of black voters and they were 21 percent of the electorate. In 2008, Barack Obama won nearly 90 percent of black voters in Ohio; they were just 18 percent of the electorate; and Clinton won the state, ironically, with the support of white voters, including white men.

Ryan, a member of a building trades union in Cleveland, who also asked NPR not to use his last name because his union has endorsed Clinton, feels the same way as Jim.

""She's [Clinton] seen as the centrist candidate,"" Ryan said. ""And she's a big-money candidate. And big money and centrism hasn't been working for middle-class America for the past 30 years. Since Reagan.""

When Ryan first saw Sanders speak a few months ago, something clicked. He said it was as if a politician was finally saying what Ryan had been thinking about the state of the country. Ryan was so swayed he even sent a small donation to Sanders campaign and later bought a T-shirt.

'Like NASCAR, everyone wear their patch'

At a union hall in Cleveland, both Jim and Ryan talked about rising health-care costs and trade deals that they believe have hurt much more than they helped.

Sanders overwhelmingly won voters in Michigan who thought trade deals cost American jobs  58 percent of voters said so there, and Sanders won them 2-to-1. (One-in-three Michigan voters said they lived in a household with a union member. Clinton and Sanders split them. Likely accounting for that were black union members who went for Clinton. Those numbers are not split out in exit polls.)

Jim said he's only gotten one raise, really more like a cost-of-living adjustment, in eight years.

""You look at the stock market,"" he said, ""it's gone up I don't know how many, a couple of hundred percent. You know, my wages have gone up 2-and-a-half percent. And who's speaking to that? Bernie is. And, yeah, I think maybe he's kind of like Don Quixote. But I mean that's part of the attraction. It really is. At least for me.""

And Jim insists, this isn't about gender. He loves his congresswoman, who incidentally endorsed Sanders on Friday.

There are elements of Clinton's stump speech designed to speak to working-class men including the parts where she talks about punishing companies that ship jobs overseas. But it's clear from these interviews that Sanders' attacks on Clinton's trade record, her superPAC, her big money speeches to Wall Street banks  they are breaking through.

The money issue nags at Dave Passalacqua. He likes that Sanders gets his campaign cash from regular people.

""There's that old saying is politicians should be like NASCAR, everyone wear their patch,"" Passalacqua said. ""You know, let's see what the patches are and [Sanders] doesn't need to wear a patch, because it's his own thing.""

'Pie in the sky'

Passalacqua is executive vice president of the Communications Workers of America Local 4340 in Cleveland. His union has endorsed Sanders, but he's still undecided.

Passalacqua agreed to meet at a Cleveland diner along with Jim Goggin, a fixture in the city's labor community. He's an organizer for the Delaware Valley Health Care Coalition.

""It's pie in the sky,"" said Goggin, with an unmistakable Irish lilt. ""I mean, everything Bernie says, I think would be fantastic. But the fact of the matter is, that I am also a realist, and I know that you can't do that.""

For Goggin, it is all about beating the Republicans in November.

""And I wish to God that I thought he could win,"" Goggin said. ""But I don't unfortunately think he can win. Consequently, I'm with Hillary, because at least she's not going to throw us under the bus, the working people.""

Passalacqua chimes in: ""And one good thing that Bernie's been doing, though, even with Hillary, is Bernie has moved Hillary's positions on things.""

From the outside, it seems Passalacqua is having a classic voter's struggle between his head and his heart. He isn't convinced Sanders will be able to do what he's promising. Who will he vote for?

""Whoever I think is going best for me and my family is the bottom line. Whoever is going to make  not to steal Donald's line, but  America great again,"" said Pasalaqua quoting Donald Trump's catch phrase. ""Because in order to make America great again we've got to make the middle class great again. So whoever's going to do that, I think's going to be the best person. And that's who I'll end up having to vote for.""

No matter how Tuesday's vote turns out, and no matter who wins the nomination, all four men said they would support the Democratic nominee in November.",[]

There is a righteous, deep-felt fury I sometimes experience when reading stupendously good work. How dare you, I shout at the author, dropping the book, pacing for a while, how dare you make me feel so much. I rant on Twitter. I joke about how the author must be stopped.

I have done all those things elsewhere and am left hollowed out. Ken Liu's The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories is a book from which I staggered away, dazed, unable to speak. I have wrestled with how to review it, circled my metaphors like a wary cat, and finally abandoned the enterprise of trying to live up to its accomplishment. I will be honest, and blunt, because this is a book that has scoured me of language and insight and left itself rattling around inside the shell of me.

I have never been so moved by a collection of short fiction. I was at times afraid to read more. Every single story struck chords in me profound enough to hurt, whether about the love and cruelty of families; the melancholy of thermodynamics; the vicious unfairness of history and the humbling grace with which people endure its weight. Stories so often take us out of ourselves; Liu's stories went deep into my marrow, laying bare painful truths, meticulously slicing through the layers of pearl to find the grain of sand at its heart.

I'd read some of these pieces when they made their first appearances in magazines: the much-lauded ""The Paper Menagerie"" in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, ""Good Hunting"" in two parts on Strange Horizons. Liu's stories always impressed me; so did his novel, The Grace of Kings. But this collection is so much more than the sum of its parts that the phrase loses all meaning. Selected from more than seventy stories published over the course of twelve years, these fifteen are strands of silk woven into a spider's web, or precise folds compressing an enormous decade-spanning oeuvre into something one can hold with two hands.

I have never been so moved by a collection of short fiction. I was at times afraid to read more.

In ""State Change"" a girl is born with an ice cube for a soul, and lives her life trying to keep it from melting. In ""The Regular,"" a private detective hunts a serial killer while wrestling with her private grief and the toll it has taken on her mechanically enhanced body. In ""All the Flavours"" a little girl in 1870s Idaho meets a man who might be the red-faced god of war, and listens to his stories. The final story  appropriately named ""The Man Who Ended History: A Documentary""  is a harrowing meditation on nations, memory, responsibility, and to whom the past can rightly be said to belong.

""For me,"" says Liu in his preface to the collection, ""all fiction is about prizing the logic of metaphors  which is the logic of narratives in general  over reality, which is irreducibly random and senseless."" This is the organizing principle of The Paper Menagerie and Other Stories, the one that drives me to grasp at pearls, and silk, and paper folds in an attempt to convey my experience of reading it. I almost want to review the preface alone. It is simultaneously a statement of purpose, a map, and a key.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge, writing in his Notebooks, once asked and answered the following question:

Why do you make a book? Because my Hands can extend but a few score Inches from my Body ... but think only of the thoughts, feelings, radical Impulse that have been implanted in how many thousands of thousands by the little Ballad of the Children in the Wood! The Sphere of Alexander the great's Agency is trifling compared with it.

Cutting across history and biology, physics and folk tales, why do you make a book is the question at the heart of this work, inseparable from what is a book and how is a book. Storytelling  whether in oral or written tradition, along family or national lines, private musing or public record  is the means of digesting, communicating, understanding histories and experiences too vast to encompass.

Whether in a letter written from a mother to her son, an alien history scratched on the surface of an irradiated planet, or myths of origin transforming to keep up with humanity's phase-shifting, stories are the language we speak to each other. In A Paper Menagerie and Other Stories, Liu speaks it with devastating eloquence.

i iStockphoto.com iStockphoto.com

I am thinking today about my new favorite thing. It's an app that my cousin told me about a few years ago that helps you bypass all the obstructions that might get in your way as you try to get somewhere: potholes, stalled cars, heavy traffic  and dare I say it  speed cameras.

To be honest, when my cousin first told me about it, I didn't pay much attention. I wasn't driving that much or we were only going to places I already knew how to go. Plus, to be fair, I learned to drive from my father  who never, as far as I can remember, ever consulted a map. I think I mistakenly absorbed the message that real drivers didn't need a map; you somehow just magically knew where to go. It was only later that I realized that just getting a driver's license didn't mean you knew how to get places  that was lesson one. Lesson two came when my kids started playing on two different travel teams. The drivers in our household suddenly had the need to head in different directions, and sometimes different states, on the same day.

Suddenly my app became very meaningful to me. How did I ever manage to get to the most obscure playing fields tucked in the back corner of a remote subdivision without it?

But Can I Just Tell You? The crazy thing I have also noticed is how often I just don't listen to it. Why might that be? Why might I ignore something I previously trusted or at least consulted to tell me about deep potholes that are almost certainly ahead? Do I think I just know better?

Or that the people who are reporting problems are somehow up to mischief, reporting phantom breakdowns that don't really exist just for the fun of it? Or do I just prefer the old routes, even if they are actually worse?

You think it's because I still buy into that message I inadvertently picked up from my dad  that somehow we automatically know the right way to go, even when all the evidence in front of us tells us there is trouble ahead. That we're heading into heavy traffic and there literally is a better way, even if it's unfamiliar.

Yes, I see an analogy to the present moment. There is ample evidence every day that some ideas, some old ideas, some long familiar ideas, will send us into a deep, teeth chattering rut. But for some reason we like those old ideas better. We like them better than an unfamiliar new route that might take us into areas we've never heard of, let alone visited. We may like the routes our parents taught us, even as we may acknowledge that we are traveling to places they never dreamed of, let alone visited.

It can be hard to admit we don't know everything, hard to admit we don't know where we're going, hard to realize we might not even like what we find when we get there. As a person who still drives an 8-year-old stick shift and who has never stood in line for anything new, I certainly understand that. But I also try to remember the times I let go of my ego, or my fear, and learned that life could be better. Not perfect  but better. I am glad I finally listened to my cousin about that app. He was right.",[]

On a recent episode of The Bachelor, the ABC dating reality show that ends its 20th season Monday night, contestant Caila Quinn brings Ben Higgins home to meet her interracial family.

""Have you ever met Filipinos before?"" Quinn's mother asks, leading Higgins into a dining room where the table is filled with traditional Filipino food.

""I don't know,"" he replies. ""No. I don't think so.""

As they sit around the adobo and pancit, Quinn's father talks to Higgins, white man to white man. What comes with dating Quinn, the father says, ""is a very special Philippine community."" Quinn grimaces.

""I had no idea what I was getting into when I married Caila's mother,"" the father says. But being married to a Filipina, he assures Higgins, has been ""the most fun"" and ""magical.""

This scene can be read as an attempt by The Bachelor franchise to dispel criticisms (and the memory of a 2012 lawsuit) concerning its whitewashed casts. It shows how these attempts can be clunky at best, offensive and creepy at worst.

Quinn's run also demonstrates how, as this rose-strewn, fantasy-fueled romance machine tries to include more people of color, diversification looks like biracial Asian-American  often known as ""hapa""  women.

Among the 19 women who have won the ""final rose"" since The Bachelor premiered in 2002, two  Tessa Horst and Catherine Giudici  have been biracial Asian-white. All other winners, aside from Mary Delgado in 2004 who was Cuban-American, appear to have been white. As these handy graphics by writer and video artist Karen X. Cheng show, in the previous seven years, the only women of color who lasted into the final few weeks were of mixed-race Asian-white background.

Other women of color on The Bachelor tend to follow a familiar pattern: they may face hostility and racial anxieties from other contestants, then disappear from the screen early in the season. The latest example is Jubilee Sharpe, this season's black military veteran who fielded microaggressions from other contestants and suffered tension with the two biracial African-American and white women. On the show, these conflicts were coded with euphemisms: Sharpe was ""layered"" and ""complicated"" and ""different."" Sharpe stuck around longer than most black women, but was still eliminated within the first half of the season.

Now, ABC executives have hinted that the next woman to lead the spin-off show The Bachelorette will be  for the first time  a woman of color. Who is the rumored lucky lady? Caila Quinn, whose father tried and failed to sell Higgins on the advantages of Filipina wives this season. Anointing her as the first bachelorette of color would be a safe, predictable choice for the franchise. Producers could hold Quinn up as proof the shows are changing, while continuing to reflect and reinforce racial stereotypes.

To understand why only a narrow group of women of color  biracial Asian-white women  survive in this world is to delve into romantic tropes, the stuff The Bachelor is made of.

""As objects of beauty, these women are benefiting from two helpful stereotypes about female desirability,"" said Ann Morning, associate professor of Sociology at New York University. One is whiteness as the persisting standard of beauty. The other is Asian women as sexualized, exotic, and submissive.

Taken alone, the first stereotype can be detrimental. ""Today, being white is often perceived as a kind of boring, colorless identity,"" Morning said. But that stereotype about whiteness can work to balance negative stereotypes about Asian women.

Lily Anne Welty Tamai, curator of history at the Japanese American National Museum (and a friend of mine), explained where these stereotypes about Asian women come from. The trope of Puccini's 1904 Madama Butterfly paved the way for American incarnations of a tragic love story between an American soldier and Asian woman in the mid-twentieth century, when American soldiers brought home war stories  and sometimes brides  from Asia, where women were often part of the conquest. Popular narratives included the 1957 film Sayonara and the 1989 musical Miss Saigon. (""I guess they just never got around to making the Korea version,"" Tamai said.)

If this show was called 'The Hook Up,' and contestants were having one-night stands, we'd see more racially diverse pools of people.""

These stories cemented in the American consciousness the idea of the Asian woman as the foreign sex toy: the geisha, the china doll, the ""Me love you long time"" sex worker.

""Asian-American women today still experience the wrath of those legacies every day,"" said Joanne Rondilla, a lecturer of Asian Pacific American Studies at Arizona State University. Rondilla pointed to the Creepy White Guys tumblr that collected offensive messages sent to Asian-American women via online dating platforms. In a similar vein, last year Mia Matsumiya created an Instagram account to post the thousand-plus ""messages from creeps, weirdos & fetishists"" she's received over the past decade. My personal favorite calling out of these dating dynamics is comedian Kristina Wong's incredible I'm Asian American and... episode in which she collects ""reparations for yellow fever"" on dates with white men.

On The Bachelor, producers exercised these stereotypes about Asian-American women the last time they cast a single-race Asian-American woman. In 2010, contestant Channy Choch was introduced to viewers and bachelor Jake Pavelka with her inviting him to have sex with her in Cambodian. Later, she laughingly spoke to the camera about how Pavelka ""needs a little bit of Cambodian fever.""

""All her moments on screen highlight her Cambodian heritage and her sexual desiresusually both at once, drawing a link between these,"" Rachel Dubrofsky told me by email. Dubrofsky, associate professor of Communication at the University of South Florida, wrote a book analyzing The Bachelor franchise, and found that women of color only win the prize of a proposal when their ""racial difference is treated as not only unimportant, but as non-existent.""

What's exciting on Tinder, the show communicates, becomes unacceptable when matrimony is involved. ""If this show was called The Hook Up, and contestants were having one-night stands, we'd see more racially diverse pools of people,"" Morning said.

Mixed-race Asian-white women become the perfect vehicles for diversity on this show because they are ""white enough to present to the family,"" as Morning said, while still being exotic enough to fill a quota. Morning suggested they also get a boost from the model minority myth and the recent idea that being multiracial is ""cool.""

Until this season's Quinn family dinner scene, the ethnic identities of hapa women have been largely unremarked upon onscreen. Instead, only a vague, alluring, comfortable kind of distinction might be mentioned. ""She was different,"" bachelor Juan Pablo Galavis said of contestant Sharleen Joynt, a Chinese-Canadian opera singer from season 18. ""She was elegant, and I was like, surprised. She was so classy. And she's sexy.""

Outside the final media product presented by makers of the show, more explicit exotification can happen. In 2007, bachelor Andy Baldwin chose Tessa Horst as his final pick. Throughout the season, Horst's Chinese-white background is never mentioned and, as Dubrofsky noted, ""is only briefly apparent during the hometown date where her [Asian] mom appears.... Her mom, however, barely speaks, and is mostly seen in the background.""

Only after the season had ended did we glimpse how Horst's race might have played into her relationship with Baldwin. At a press conference in Waikiki, Baldwin said of his choice, ""I always say the mutts are the most exotic and beautiful.""

This is the kind of comment mixed-race Asian-American women contend with outside the sanitized space of The Bachelor. ""We're exotified for being mixed,"" said Athena Mari Asklipiadis, a board member at Multiracial Americans of Southern California. ""If a man has an Asian fetish, he'll play that up in what he sees in me."" She said fetishization also can come from Asian-American men who see her whiteness as exotic.

If Caila Quinn is cast as the first bachelorette of color, producers will probably continue to omit thornier realities. Her casting could represent some form of progress, though, if producers continue to highlight her Filipina heritage, however awkwardly. Portraying an Asian-American woman as the ultimate marriage material  and not as a sexualized joke  could signal a step toward better humanizing people of color in this space. But it also could be just another spin on the ""model minority"" myth.

And there's the question of how diverse her suitors would be. A bachelorette of color presents a dilemma for producers: either an interracial romance  still controversial to some viewers  or a relationship in which neither person is white (who will the white audience relate to?).

Myra Washington, assistant professor of Communication at the University of New Mexico, predicted an increase in black contestants if Quinn becomes the bachelorette. ""Not Wesley Snipes-black, because this is still TV,"" she said. She guessed there would be more mixed-race African-Americans, brown-skinned men, Latinos. But colonial legacies and systems of power die hard. ""I think she'll ultimately end up with a white dude,"" she said.

More than a dozen people in Ivory Coast have been killed in an attack on a several popular beach hotels on Sunday.

Six armed militants targeted beach-goers and hotel guests in Grand-Bassam, a historic resort town located about 25 miles east of Abdijan, Ivory Coast.

The gunmen killed 14 people, according to Ivory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara; he says the six militants have also been killed. Ouattara is visiting the sites of the shootings to express his condolences.

The hotels in Grand-Bassam are frequented by both locals and foreign tourists, NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton says.

""Witnesses describe heavily-armed gunmen shooting guests on the beach, before opening fire on nearby hotels,"" Ofeibea tells our Newscast unit.

She says Ivory Coast is currently experiencing a heat wave, driving visitors to the tourist destination.

The militant Islamist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, has claimed responsibility for the attack, according to the SITE intelligence group.

The capitals of nearby Mali and Burkina Faso have recently been struck by similar attacks on upscale hotels, which were also claimed by AQIM.

A hotel in Bamako, Mali, was attacked in November and more than 170 guests were taken hostage, with more than 20 fatalities. A hotel in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, was stormed in January; 126 people were taken hostage and about 20 people killed. Both hotels were popular with Westerners.

AQIM claimed joint responsibility for the Mali attack and sole responsibility for the Burkina Faso attack. This is the third attack in West Africa since October for which AQIM has claimed responsibility.

npr.org,2016-03-14 00:00:00,Cancer And Arthritis Drugs Drive Up Spending On Medicines : Shots,[],"Cancer And Arthritis Drugs Drive Up Spending On Medicines

Spending on prescription drugs in the U.S. rose 5.2 percent in 2015, driven mostly by increased costs of expensive specialty medications to treat conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, according to data from the largest manager of employers' drug benefits.

Spending on specialty medications rose 18 percent, while spending on standard prescription drugs rose less than one percent, according to a new report by Express Scripts. The report is based on the prescription drug spending for the company's 80 million covered patients.

The measure  called ""drug trend"" in pharmaceutical industry parlance  includes increases in the use of medications and price hikes.

Still, in the health care industry, an increase that's more than quadruple the rate of inflation  0.7 percent in 2015  still counts as a bit of good news. Why? In 2014, drug spending increased more than 14 percent.

""In a year when all the headlines were about the escalating price of drugs, overall costs rose only 5.2 percent,"" says Glen Stettin, Express Scripts' chief innovation officer.

The overall boost in drug spending was moderated by patients switching to generic drugs from brand names, whose prices rose 16.2 percent.

Stettin attributed that shift to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers exerting more control over the drugs their customers can get. Express Scripts and other companies have been more willing to refuse coverage of expensive medications than in the past.

The company pointed to its initial refusal to pay for Gilead Sciences' hepatitis C drugs, which were listed at more than $90,000 for a course of treatment. Instead, Express Scripts opted to cover an alternative treatment, Viekira Pak made by AbbVie, for which it negotiated a 50 percent discount. Express Scripts has said it saved as much as $1 billion with the deal.

Brand name drug prices are more than 2 1/2 times as high as they were in 2008, while generic prices have declined by about two-thirds.

For traditional pills, ""total costs are flat as result of generic and effective price negotiation by payors,"" says Ronny Gal, a pharmaceutial industry analyst at the investment firm Alliance Bernstein. ""For specialty drugs, there are more drug introductions, at very high price per patient per year, and we still don't have effective alternatives on the market.""

The report says the surge in spending on specialty drugs was caused in part by the 29 new medications that were approved by the Food and Drug Administration last year, including 19 cancer drugs that are being used on a large number of patients. The prices of older cancer drugs also rose, including for example, the price of Gleevec, which is used to treat adults with leukemia. It went up 19.3 percent last year, the report says.

But drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and other inflammatory illnesses sucked up the largest share of cash. Express Scripts says treatments for such conditions cost every person with insurance about $89 last year. Insurers use a measure known as ""per member per year"" to show how spending is spread across population of insured people.

Diabetes treatments dominated the spending on nonspecialty medications, the report shows, with spending rising 14 percent last year. Three of the top five traditional prescription drugs were diabetes medications  Lantus and Humalog, which are both forms of insulin, and Januvia, a pill that helps control blood sugar.

People who bought insurance through the exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act spent an average of $777 on medications last year, about 15 percent higher than the year before.

The big increase ""may be due to patients in this population filling a previously unmet need,"" according to the report.

Since the exchanges have only been in place for two full years, Stettin says this is the first time there was good information available about people covered by those policies.

The spending increase ""is consistent with the belief that people in the exchange plans, people with chronic conditions, are getting medications for the first time,"" he says.

The Express Scripts report takes into account the effect of rebates that the company negotiates with drugmakers without disclosing the details of the arrangements. Rebates are considered trade secrets.

Bruce Stuart, executive director of the Peter Lamy Center for Drug Therapy and Aging at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy, says the data are different from what he would have expected based on trends in retail prices.

""I have no reason to doubt their numbers,"" he tells Shots. ""If they say that they are getting better deals, there's no way to validate that. """,[]

Today is Pi Day, a time to celebrate the never-ending number that helps us calculate the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.

Here in the U.S., Pi Day has officially become a ""thing""  for example, today at Whole Foods, you can get slices of pie for $3.14, and if you can solve math problems from a Princeton professor, Pizza Hut will give you 3.14 years' worth of free pizza.

The developing world, which we cover in this blog, loves its pi, too.

Suresh Kumar Sharma, a 21-year-old former vegetable vendor from Jaipur, India, is the current record holder on the Pi World Ranking List when it comes to reciting the digits of pi. In October 2015, he recited 70,030 numbers in 17 hours. To do it, he associated every number with an image. Now he helps coach others in their memorization skills.

The Guinness World Records, however, says the top pi reciter is Rajveer Meena from India who reeled off 70,000 digits in just 10 hours in 2015 while blindfolded.

(Meanwhile, a 69-year-old Japanese man says he's the unofficial record-holder, claiming he can recite about 111,700 digits.)

Here's a roundup of global pi facts, past and present.

An Egyptian scribe named Ahmes was one of the first to record the value of pi, around 1650 B.C. On the famous Rhind Papyrus, a collection of math problems, Ahmes wrote, ""Cut off 1/9 of a diameter and construct a square upon the remainder; this has the same area as the circle."" According to his calculation, pi equaled 3.16. That's just about 1 percent off the modern 3.14 number and closer than what the Chinese were using hundreds of years later: pi = 3.

Over time, global math gurus have made pi more accurate. In the year 480, the Chinese brought pi to six digits. In 1400, Indian scholars helped push it to 11 digits. Thanks to computers, we're up to 13.3 trillion digits today.

In India, a Sanskrit verse gives the value of pi up to 31 decimal places. Numbers are translated into alphabetical code  for example, ""ka"" represents 1, ""ra"" for 2, ""gha"" for 3 and so on  and strung together. The verse doubles as a hymn to Lord Krishna.

The top five spots in the Pi World Ranking List, a global list of people who can recite the most pi digits by heart, belong to India and China.

A couple of Namibian kids got special notice from the list in 2007 for reciting 30 decimal points ... while juggling three balls.

Kansas is the overall No. 1 seed. North Carolina got another of the top spots. The other No. 1s, Virginia and Oregon, were considered surprises in some circles. The 68-team tournament starts Tuesday.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

It is about as exciting as college basketball gets without the sweat and squeaking sneakers and school bands. Of course, we're talking about the televised selection shows picking the teams for the men's and women's Division I tournaments. Yesterday was Selection Sunday for the men. Selection Monday for the women is today. NPR sports correspondent Tom Goldman joins us now. Good morning.

TOM GOLDMAN, BYLINE: Hi, Renee.

MONTAGNE: There is, of course, Tom, usually some grumbling about seedings and who gets left out. Did that happen yesterday?

GOLDMAN: Oh, sure it did. You know, there's some justifiable griping about Monmouth and St. Bonaventure and other worthy so-called mid-major teams being left out while bigger, but not better, teams like Syracuse and Tulsa got in. But let's focus on the surprise at the top of the heat - Michigan State not being a No. 1 seed. The No. 1s in the four regions are North Carolina, Kansas, Virginia and Oregon. Michigan State was top-ranked in the nation for several weeks during the regular season. The Spartans won the Big Ten Conference tournament yesterday. Meanwhile, Virginia lost in its season-ending ACC Tournament. Many thought, therefore, Michigan State was more worthy of a top seed than Virginia.

But, you know what, Michigan State players and their head coach Tom Izzo say it doesn't matter. The Spartans have a No. 2 seed instead of a No. 1. In fact, the Spartans made it to the final four last year as a 7 seed. So this will just give Michigan State more incentive to prove the selection committee wrong.

MONTAGNE: Well, I guess it is not surprising that there was controversy since the regular season was so topsy-turvy.

GOLDMAN: You know, it was musical chairs in the rankings much of the season - no one dominant team. In fact, the four No. 1 seeds that I was just talking about - they have a combined 23 losses. Last year, the top 4 seeds had a combined 9 losses. So there's been some complaining that the tournament is going to be more of the lackluster regular season without the truly great teams or great players who'll be sure-thing NBA stars. But the positive side to that - this tournament has the potential to be wide-open, meaning there could be some true madness to this March.

MONTAGNE: But it appears that this tournament is a bit of a throwback to when older, more mature players were in the spotlight.

GOLDMAN: That's absolutely right. We are so used to the one-and-done phenomenon - freshman blowing through a season on their way to the NBA, but not this year. The freshman player everyone was talking about through the regular season, LSU's Ben Simmons - you won't see him in the tournament. His team didn't make it. You will see seniors like Denzel Valentine and Bryn Forbes for Michigan State, Buddy Hield for Oklahoma, Perry Ellis for Kansas and many more. More mature guys - and there's a chance you'll see better basketball because of it.

MONTAGNE: And let's get to the women's tournament which takes shape tonight. It appears, again, to be UConn versus the world.

GOLDMAN: (Laughter) Yeah. Here's what counts for drama this past regular season in the women's game. Notre Dame and Maryland lost to UConn by 10 points. That's the closest anyone got. The Huskies were 32-0. They won those 32 games by an average of 39.7 points. And over the past three years, UConn's won-loss record, Renee - 110-1. That's crazy.

MONTAGNE: OK. Tell us about the other talented teams.

GOLDMAN: Well, there definitely are. I mentioned Notre Dame, Maryland - also South Carolina and Baylor. But, you know, there's talented and then, again, there's UConn. The Huskies don't seem to have any off nights. They're the one team in sports you can't jinx by saying they're going to win, so I will say it.

MONTAGNE: (Laughter) OK. Said - let's count it as said. Tom, thanks very much.

GOLDMAN: You're welcome.

MONTAGNE: That's NPR sports correspondent Tom Goldman.

David Greene talks to former national security official Richard Clarke about the fight between Apple and the FBI. The FBI wants an iPhone that was used by one of the San Bernardino shooters unlocked.

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

In the long debate over an iPhone, there has been a voice missing - President Obama's. It is not clear how he feels about the Justice Department demanding that Apple help unlock the phone belonging to one of the San Bernardino shooters. But over the weekend, Obama did say this.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: If, technologically, it is possible to make an impenetrable device or system where the encryption is so strong that there's no key - there's no door at all - then how do we apprehend the child pornographer? How do we solve or disrupt a terrorist plot?

GREENE: Disrupting terrorist plots was Richard Clarke's mission for years. And we're adding his voice this morning in the ongoing debate over whether Apple should design a way for the government to break into that iPhone. Richard Clarke led counterterrorism efforts for two presidents - Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.

RCHARD CLARKE: For nine years, I was the senior counterterrorism official in the U.S. government. And I went to bed every night worrying about terrorist attacks. Had I done enough to stop a terrorist attack that might be out there that I don't know about? I know what the counterterrorism feels like because I was there. But I also operated within limits. And within the United States government, we've decided long ago that there are limits on what we're going to do in the war against terrorism. Under the Obama administration, for example, we've said we're not going to torture people. You know, we could, at the far extreme to make the FBI's job easier, put ankle bracelets on everybody so that we'd know where everybody was all the time. That's a ridiculous example, but my point is encryption and privacy are larger issues than fighting terrorism.

GREENE: But can you just explain why you would compare, you know, a company helping the government design a way to unlock an iPhone to something extreme as torture and ankle bracelets? I mean, that sounds like a very extreme jump.

CLARKE: No, the point I'm trying to make is there are limits. And what this is is a case where the federal government, using a 1789 law, is trying to compel speech. And courts have ruled in the past, appropriately, that the government cannot compel speech. What the FBI and the Justice Department are trying to do is to make code writers at Apple - to make them write code that they do not want to write that will make their systems less secure.

GREENE: And why do you say that's compelling speech, just so I understand that?

CLARKE: Well, they're compelling them to write code. And the courts have ruled in the past that computer code is speech.

GREENE: Some have said that while this seems like it could be a dangerous precedent, it's not because Apple has had to relent to pressure in the past and has been willing to do so. And I've been reading about, you know, last year when China - the Chinese government - requested data on a few thousand iPhones and Apple was willing to offer it. I mean, that sounds to some, I would imagine, like a scarier thing than helping the U.S. government unlock one iPhone.

CLARKE: Apple helps law enforcement organizations in the United States and Apple helps law enforcement organizations overseas when they have a duly authorized request for material that Apple has. Apple doesn't have this material. If it were in the Cloud, if the FBI and the San Bernardino County hadn't made a mistake on the way they treated this phone, this information would be in the iCloud and Apple would allow access to that because Apple has that information.

GREENE: What do you know about the debate within the Obama administration? It's been reported that there really is a fierce debate over how to handle this.

CLARKE: Well, I don't think it's a fierce debate. I think the Justice Department and the FBI are on their own here. You know, the secretary of defense has said how important encryption is when asked about this case. The National Security Agency director and three past National Security Agency directors, a former CIA director, a former Homeland Security secretary have all said that they're much more sympathetic with Apple in this case. You really have to understand that the FBI director is exaggerating the need for this and is trying to build it up as an emotional case, organizing the families of the victims and all of that. And it's Jim Comey and the attorney general is letting him get away with it.

GREENE: So if you were still inside the government right now as a counterterrorism official, could you have seen yourself being more sympathetic with the FBI in doing everything for you that it can to crack this case?

CLARKE: No, David. If I were in the job now, I would have simply told the FBI to call Fort Meade, the headquarters of the National Security Agency, and NSA would have solved this problem for them. They're not as interested in solving the problem as they are in getting a legal precedent.

GREENE: Wow, that sounds like quite a charge. You're suggesting they could have just gone to the NSA to crack this iPhone but they're presenting this case because they want to set a precedent to be able to do it in the future?

CLARKE: Every expert I know believes that NSA could crack this phone. They want the precedent that the government can compel a computer device manufacturer to allow the government in.

GREENE: Richard Clarke, thanks so much for talking to us. We appreciate it.

CLARKE: Thank you, David.

i toggle caption Elissa Nadworny/NPR Elissa Nadworny/NPR

Before I became a reporter, I was a teacher. After 27 years on the education beat, I've met a few fantastic teachers and a few bad ones. So I've wondered, where would I have fit in? Was I a good teacher?

Recently I went back to the site of the school where I taught so many years ago, just outside Tucson, Ariz. Treehaven was both a day school and a boarding school for so-called ""troubled kids.""

The actual school and the people who ran it are long gone. The property, now called Circle Tree Ranch, houses a residential drug-rehabilitation facility for families and children. The company that runs the place today has nothing to do with Treehaven, but one of the administrators was nice enough to give me a brief tour.

I look for something familiar. I'm told almost all the buildings have been remodeled. Most classrooms were torn down, including mine. But the smell of the place  60 acres perfumed by desert flowers, palo verde trees and cacti  takes me back.

As I walk along a narrow dirt path, I remember how amazing the school seemed when I came here in 1977. I'd been hired to teach Spanish and English as a second language in grades pre-K all the way up through middle school.

Treehaven had a rigorous curriculum, a core of veteran teachers, instruction tailored to each student's needs and a focus on discipline and structure  and, best of all, terrific kids.

They were learning-disabled, they were brilliant, they were troubled, they were rich, they were poor. I was convinced that teaching these kinds of kids would be my life.

i toggle caption Courtesy of Claudio Sanchez Courtesy of Claudio Sanchez

But I left after two years. And ever since, a nagging question has bothered me: Was I a good teacher?

This year, as we began a series reporting on great teachers and what makes them effective, I called one of my former students, John Putz. It's hard to believe, but he's now 47 years old. He was 8 or 9 when I met him at Treehaven.

I knew how to get hold of John because, some years ago, he had heard me on NPR and sent me an email: Was I the same Claudio Sanchez who taught at a boarding school in Arizona? And if so, did I have any reflections?

None that I wanted to share back then. But I do now. There was so much that John and I needed to catch up on. On the phone, he reminds me that he never thought of himself as a ""troubled kid.""

John says his family history is a long story, but basically his father didn't believe much in the nuclear family, and that's why he ended up at Treehaven.

i toggle caption Courtesy of Claudio Sanchez Courtesy of Claudio Sanchez

""Not that I was a bad kid,"" says John. Abandoned  that's how he says he felt.

I wasn't surprised. You see, after I started teaching at Treehaven, it didn't take long for me to realize that many of the boarding students felt abandoned. Some came from broken homes, mostly the result of divorce. Others had been in and out of foster homes. A few kids had been expelled from one school or another.

I just thought they were all really smart. You know, the kind of kids who may be a pain in the neck, but, boy, are they fun to teach.

Besides teaching English and Spanish, I was a dorm parent with eight boys under my care, including John. I also taught creative writing and photography, drove the school van, helped coach our winless soccer team and cooked breakfast on weekends. Kids loved my French toast. I loved flying kites with them on Sundays.

i toggle caption Courtesy of Claudio Sanchez Courtesy of Claudio Sanchez

One of the best things about Treehaven was its 4-H program. Kids cared for rabbits and hamsters, pigs, sheep, horses and chickens that they showed off at the county fair. I don't know why I never wrote down on my resume that I had once supervised a 4-H goat club.

But Treehaven's seemingly healthy, nurturing academic culture was, as John puts it, ""one of two realities.""

""I remember a lot of the teachers, their creativity and how they taught us,"" says John. ""But what [Treehaven] did wrong was it had a cruel and mean headmaster. I remember one little girl. ... She was less than 5, I think.""

John is referring to Candy, the youngest child at Treehaven at the time.

i toggle caption Courtesy of Claudio Sanchez Courtesy of Claudio Sanchez

""She wouldn't eat her oatmeal, and they just kept her strapped in her chair, like, all morning,"" John recalls. ""And at some point somebody dumped the oatmeal over her head. We all came in for lunch, and she was sitting there with oatmeal all over her head.""

I confess, I felt complicit when things like that happened. That's probably why I didn't respond to John's email back in 1997.

I mean, not long after I left Treehaven, I really did struggle to reconcile my decision to leave teaching and the children I had grown so fond of. I felt I had failed as a teacher. I was young  and, in hindsight, totally unprepared to deal with children who emotionally required so, so much.

John says he understands.

""Yeah, I think that would be a hard thing to come to terms with. ... You were a victim of it, I guess, as much as the rest of us. ... You couldn't change how they ran the place. I mean, you must have been in your early 20s in this crazy environment.""

i toggle caption Courtesy of Claudio Sanchez Courtesy of Claudio Sanchez

John's comments help. In my minds eye, he's still that little boy who grew up without his parents. But he went on to get his Ph.D. in physics, married, had three children and today sounds like he's a happy human being.

I think of him as an incredible success story from Treehaven. John says he doesn't really think about that: ""I kind of think of myself as somebody who survived and can lead a fairly normal life.""

Which brings me back to that question I've asked myself over and over. Did I have a role, no matter how small, in any of my students' success? Was I a good teacher?

""I think you were a good teacher,"" says John. ""I feel affection and gratitude for you and the other teachers. I mean, I don't have any feelings that you guys let us down.""

It's good to hear John say that. It's what all teachers need to hear at some point in their careers, a validation of sorts. Even if it's only from one student, decades later.",[]
npr.org,2016-03-14 00:00:00,Why Do Many Evangelicals Back Donald Trump?,[],"GOP Mystery: Why Do Many Evangelicals Back Donald Trump?

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

One of the many mysteries of this election season is why a thrice married casino mogul who glorifies wealth and has boasted of his adultery is attracting the support of self-identified devout Christians. And we are talking about Donald Trump. He has won primaries across the Bible Belt and polls well among Republican evangelical Protestants and Catholics. Ralph Reed knows this group of Christian voters well, and he joins us now to help explain what's going on. Good morning.

RALPH REED: Good morning, Renee.

MONTAGNE: Now, you know, if there is a single name associated with organizing the Christian vote, it might well be yours. You were the head of the Christian coalition in the 1990s, the group that helped usher in a Republican Congress. And you agree that this has mystified a lot of people. So tell us how - what you've come to in the way of the reason why.

REED: Well, first of all, I should preface my analysis by making it clear that both I and Faith and Freedom Coalition are strictly and assiduously neutral in the primary. I've got a lot of friends running for president, and I'm for my friends. But I think first of all, we need a reality check - he is winning a plurality of that vote. And it's impressive in a crowded field, no question about it.

But right now, Donald Trump is winning about a third of the self-identified evangelical vote, which, by the way, was 51 percent of primary votes cast in 2012. So it's a very significant constituency. But still, that's about the same percentage that a Republican front-runner traditionally wins in the primaries. That's what McCain won; it's what Romney won. So I think when you put it in context why - number one, they don't vote primarily based on identity politics.

MONTAGNE: Although - although, but - although I must say that they often describe themselves - I'm talking about evangelical voters especially - as values voters.

REED: Sure.

MONTAGNE: So what would those values be?

REED: Well, under that rubric they would not have voted for Ronald Reagan, the first divorced man who ever ran for president, who was ever elected president, over Jimmy Carter, who was a very pious Southern Baptist. He was a member of their denomination, many of them, yet they voted for Reagan. They voted for Mitt Romney, who was a Mormon, a denomination whose theology many find anathema over Barack Obama, who was a self-professed Christian. Why?

MONTAGNE: OK, so they will - yeah, why? They will...

REED: Because...

MONTAGNE: ...Forgive a lot...

REED: Because they are like all voters. They're driven by issues. And on the social and moral issues - marriage, abortion, religious liberty, support for Israel - Trump not only checks all those boxes, Renee, but if you go to one of his rallies, as I did, it's surprising how much of his stump speech speaks to those issues. And secondly, like all voters, many believers - not just evangelicals but Catholics and those of other faiths - are also driven by economic anxiety and some of the issues that Trump talks about in terms of projecting U.S. strength on the international stage. They're not immune from those appeals.

MONTAGNE: Let me ask you about something though that does tend to make news, a comment that reflects other comments that Donald Trump has made. He told CNN recently Islam hates us. How much does that speak to the conservative Christian support for Donald Trump?

REED: You know, I think if you took a poll, I think most evangelicals would not say that all Muslims hate America. But I do think they would agree not only with Trump but with a lot of other critiques of the state of Islam today that there's a problem in their ranks that for whatever reason they have not been able to deal with. You know, if you've gotten members invoking your faith to cut off the heads of Christians and to massacre people and to blow up innocent people at a Jewish wedding, that's a problem that needs to be dealt with. I think that message does resonate. Even though I personally don't agree that all Muslims hate America, I don't believe the love Muslim faith ipso facto is a religion of hatred.

MONTAGNE: Well, we're going to have to end it there. Thank you very much for joining us.

REED: Thank you.

MONTAGNE: Ralph Reed is the head of the Faith and Freedom Coalition.

Now news of a terror attack in the West African nation of Ivory Coast. The president of that country says 14 civilians including two Westerners were killed by gunmen at a beach resort near the city that is the commercial capital of Ivory Coast. Six attackers are also reported dead. Here's NPR Ofeibea Quist-Arcton.

OFEIBEA QUIST-ARCTON, BYLINE: The assault on the beach in Grand-Bassam is already being dubbed Black Sunday. The Atlantic Coast weekend getaway, favored by Ivorians and foreigners, is located within easy reach of Ivory Coast's main city Abidjan. President Alassane Ouattara spoke from the scene hours after the attack he described as cowardly terrorism, which, he says, will not be tolerated.

PRES ALASSANE OUATTARA: (Foreign language spoken).

QUIST-ARCTON: Questions are being raised about Ivory Coast's security preparedness, but the president praised the special forces for their swift intervention in the former French colony emerging from a prolonged Civil War. Witnesses describe panic and people fleeing as masked gunmen opened fire on beachgoers and swimmers along a stretch of three popular hotels and numerous eating spots Bassam.

Oncologist Theodora Ross discusses the hereditary nature of cancer and her own predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer, which led her to have a double mastectomy and to have her ovaries removed.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. If you have a history of cancer in your family, you may be wondering if you should get a genetic test to see if you have any genetic mutations that might predispose you to cancer. My guest has had a lot of experience with that issue, professionally and personally. Dr. Theodora Ross directs the Cancer Genetics Program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. She is an oncologist who specializes in treating breast cancer, and she directs a research lab focusing on how cancer genes turn normal cells into cancer cells.

In spite of her knowledge and in spite of the history of cancer in her family including her uncle, father, mother, brother and sister, she didn't get tested until she was diagnosed with a melanoma. The melanoma was successfully treated but it scared her into wanting to know if she had the so-called breast cancer gene. After getting tested, she found out she had that gene. We'll hear what she did in response a little later. Dr. Ross has written a book that's part memoir, part medical science, called, ""A Cancer In The Family.""

Dr. Theodora Ross, welcome to FRESH AIR. So I have never gotten a kind of genetic testing that you've gotten, so I do not know if I'm genetically predisposed to cancer. I'm not sure I want to know. For me it, a little bit of self-deception is probably - (laughter), is maybe a healthy thing. You're an advocate of testing. You direct a cancer genetics program yet you put off getting tested yourself for years in spite of a history of cancer in your family. So why did you put it off for so long?

THEODORA ROSS: I was around the edges of trying to understand my own family's history of cancer. We were in a study by a research institution. I talked to a genetic counselor and asked them if they knew anything. And, it's interesting, they said it was not clearly hereditary in our family, but I changed the words around and told my fiance at the time that it was clearly not hereditary, and we went ahead and got married. But within the first year of getting married, I came down with melanoma, and at that point, I think, was when that denial went away.

And I decided to talk to another friend who was a genetics expert at The Ohio State University, and they evaluated me. I got tested. And I can just say it really changed how I saw things. So I went from this state of constant uncertainty and not knowing to knowing, and it was exhilarating. It was...

GROSS: Exhilarating? Scary is a word that comes to mind for me. (Laughter).

ROSS: It was exhilarating because all of a sudden, we discovered we had a particular mutation, a BRCA1 mutation, going throughout our family that certainly was a contributor to my sister's death and...

GROSS: Your sister died of breast cancer.

ROSS: Breast cancer, yes. In her 30s.

GROSS: So you mentioned you were diagnosed with melanoma before getting genetically tested. That was treated surgically and that...

ROSS: Exactly, it was tiny melanoma. (Laughter).

GROSS: OK so you were done with that, but then you got tested, found out that you tested positive for the so-called breast cancer gene, which also left you predisposed to ovarian cancer. So after getting this information and thinking it through, you decided to have a double mastectomy and to have both of your ovaries removed. How did you reach that decision?

ROSS: Well, once I figured out I had the mutation, it was pretty clear because I think I'd been thinking about it for years. You know, being a doctor, being an oncologist, seeing the data, I'd been thinking about it. So I was already prepared, plus I'd seen my sister go through this and other people in the family go through these things. And so for me, it was an instant decision - I don't want to get that, I don't want to go through that, and the data is really good for that preventing cancer. So it was a pretty quick decision for me. Many patients, it's not. It takes them some time.

GROSS: So you had the surgery done. How long ago was that?

ROSS: That was in 2004. So 12 years ago.

GROSS: So how effective was getting the double mastectomy and the - getting your ovaries removed? How effective was that in diminishing your fear of getting cancer?

ROSS: A hundred percent. (Laughter). I mean, I - of course, I could have a relapse or I could get a new melanoma, if that's caused by this BRCA mutation. I could have cancer, yes. But the reality is, is I probably have a lower risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer than the general population.

GROSS: So you tried to understand the source of your genetic predisposition to cancer. Your father and your mother had cancer. One of your uncles had cancer. Your sister died of cancer. Your brother had cancer. So - but you were assuming that since Ashkenazi Jews are especially prone to have this genetic predisposition, and since your father is Jewish and your mother not, you assumed that this gene came from your father's side of the family. But in doing your genetic research, you learned something very interesting about your mother's family. What did you learn?

ROSS: Well, yes, it was really quite shocking. So, you know, Mother's always right, as they say. So when we discovered that I had the mutation, we went to visit her. We had Sunday dinner with her and we were talking to her about it and telling her that this came from her late husband's side of the family, certainly, since he was a Jew.

And she said, no, that's not the case. And we said, no, it is the case. And she also didn't get the idea that my brothers each had a 50 percent chance of having this mutation. They hadn't been tested at that time, it was so early in this discovery. And as we were talking, it became clear that as part of this research study we were in, she had received a letter when my father was dying.

He was in hospice and so she kind of filed it away - but, a letter from them saying, we have new information for you. And when I got all the records from them and I'm reading through it, I find that they'd never tested my father. They'd tested my mom, and she was the one -the Polish Catholic - that carried his supposed Ashkenazi Jewish mutation.

GROSS: So what responsibility did you feel to the rest of your family when you found out that you had this gene? 'Cause if it runs in the family, do you have a responsibility to tell, like, you know, nieces and nephews and uncles and aunts and cousins? And, say they don't want to know?

ROSS: Yes, once you find out you've found a mutation, there is a responsibility to inform as many relatives as you can because you can save their life. When I first got the mutation information, I called my uncle - my dad's brother - because remember, he's Jewish and so we thought that's where the mutation was. And he's a psychiatrist and understands medicine.

And he, right away, even though he's Jewish and ultimately we would've found out it hadn't come from his family, he still tested to make sure because he's got four daughters and a son. And he turned it out to be negative, which was really great for them. My mother's side of the family, it's more difficult. We don't know people like my father's side of the family, and one of the hopefully exciting parts of this book will be that they'll read it and they'll find out they have a mutation and save their life.

GROSS: So you are a strong advocate of genetic testing, but not everybody needs to get tested? Like, who should get tested?

ROSS: I think it should start out with looking at your family. And a family history is so important, so hard to get. It's a noble cause to try to get an accurate family history. You'd be surprised how inaccurate our family histories are, including my own. I don't know if my aunt had ovarian cancer, or was it endometrial cancer? Everybody goes back and forth on that, and the records don't exist. But getting that family history is the first step before testing.

And if you find your family history has a strong, you know, component of cancer in it or of some other disease - heart disease or a neurologic disease - seeing a genetic specialist and flushing that out, they help you. They go through each step, they tell you what the issues are and whether or not you're really looking at this right. So it's an objective view. And then they can help you determine whether or not there's a specific gene or set of genes to figure out whether there is a genetic predisposition to your disease, cancer or otherwise.

GROSS: Why do you need to know this before getting tested? I mean, why can't you just give a sample and say, tell me what mutations I have?

ROSS: It's tough because we have 20,000 genes in our genome. We have lots of interspersed sequences. We have a very complex genome. So just sequencing your genome won't help you very much. If you're Ashkenazi Jewish then it is a reasonable thing to consider getting tested for the mutations with that heritage. So there are three BRCA mutations - BRCA1, two of them, and BRCA2, one of them - that are at a high enough frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish population that screening for those is a reasonable thing. I think it's 1 in 40.

And so those are reasonable getting without any family history - you're Ashkenazi Jewish, I'd test for those three. But in general, just testing people is kind of a random process and so the family history will tell you. And in addition to that, if your family history is, you know, very - there are lots of cancers - like, for example, Angelina Jolie had a BRCA1 mutation, and she had a very strong family history. With that, her risk is higher than somebody who has the same mutation but doesn't have a family history but has a large number of females in it. It's not just the mutation that contributes to the risk, it's also the amount of cancer in the family and how early those cancers occurred.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Dr. Theodora Ross. Her new book is called, ""A Cancer In The Family: Take Control Of Your Genetic Inheritance.""

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Dr. Theodora Ross. She's the author of a new book ""A Cancer In The Family: Take Control Of Your Genetic Inheritance."" And she leads the cancer genetics program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. She also leads a lab that investigates how cells transform from normal cells to cancer cells.

And she tests positive for the gene that predisposes people to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. She had a double mastectomy and had her ovaries removed in around 2004 when she found this out. So do you give people any advice about how to make the decision if they do test positive for the breast cancer gene, how to decide whether to have a mastectomy or not?

ROSS: Yes. I mean, you really - it's so individual. And luckily, we have genetic counselors who can help, you know, with the daily process of going through that. It takes more than, you know, just oh, I have the information and therefore I'm going to have the surgeries or I'm going to be followed and try to catch an early cancer. You know, it takes some time.

And if a person doesn't have cancer when they find out they have the mutation, there's no rush. So that's the first thing, you know, take your time. But in the end, the reality is that if you have these surgeries, you prevent cancer. This is one of those cancers - situations - it's like smoking. If you stop smoking or you don't smoke, the chances are you won't get lung cancer. If you have prophylactic surgeries, the chances are you won't get breast cancer or you won't get ovarian cancer - pretty good chances. I mean, there's a very slight chance that you will, but you've reduced it by 95 to 99 percent.

GROSS: Say you get tested and you're positive for the gene, but you don't want to get a mastectomy. Is this going to be on your health records? Will employers ever know about this and decide not to hire you because you're predisposed to cancer? Will your health insurance rates go up? What are some of the outcomes as information ripples out into the world, if it does?

ROSS: Well, there is the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act that was passed in 2008, which does in some cases prevent such discrimination. So, for example, if you're - work for an employer that has more than 15 employees, they can't discriminate if they find out that you have a mutation, a genetic defect that may affect your health. In this case, If you have the surgeries, however - and life insurances are starting to catch on to this - is if you do this, it's sort of like not smoking. All of a sudden, you're a good bet for them. And they're starting to catch that.

So life insurance is also something that you probably want to get before you find out if you have a mutation. But I've talked to people who are insurance agents for life insurance companies, and they're starting to advocate for it and for action, which is remarkable. But in terms of the Nondiscrimination Act, it was a big deal for genetics so that you can get tested. And in terms of insurance companies - health insurance - you cannot be discriminated against.

It does get into your record now. It used to be we had these shadow records where we didn't put them into the real record. And that was a real problem because then we lost all these people who had mutations and we weren't able to have an accurate medical history on these patients. So now it's in the record, it's good. And in terms of discrimination, I feel it's becoming a historical fact.

GROSS: One of the things you write about in your book is how there's a lot of secrecy surrounding cancer. You write about the difference between secrecy and privacy. Privacy came up for you when you found out that you were positive for the cancer gene, the breast cancer gene. And your husband - who works in a lab that shares a building with a lab that you had - he sent out to what I think is a really interesting email to his fellow workers in that lab. And I just want to read an excerpt of it.

It starts with you may have noticed I've been unusually busy and stressed lately, and I thought it important to share with you some personal information. And he goes on to tell them that you were diagnosed with melanoma in the fall, you had surgery. It was caught early. But as a result of that and cancer in your family, you got the genetic test, which came back positive.

So he writes (reading) the medical issues are complex and distressing. As as a result, Theo and I are quite preoccupied as we work to resolve them. I'm sure that you can understand that this is personal and know that you will respect our privacy by keeping this information confidential. I realize that you may be concerned, but please don't ask for updates or additional information from me or Theo as we're trying to figure this stuff out ourselves. I thought that was really an interesting - I understood the explanations and him asking for, you know, his colleagues to respect your privacy. And I was kind of surprised when he said don't ask for updates or additional information. Can you talk more about that request and why it was important to you both?

ROSS: You know, we really wanted to do the right thing. We wanted to get the right surgeons. We wanted to tell all the family members. We wanted everybody who needed the information to have the information. It was complicated, you know, just trying to figure out where to do things, how to get them done, how to keep our jobs going, how to keep our family happy. And to have distractions of other people, that was a big issue is just to keep it simple and keep go forward and get it done.

GROSS: Now, if I understand correctly, all cancers are caused by genetic mutations but only some of those mutations are genetically passed on...

ROSS: Right.

GROSS: ...Within families.

ROSS: That's right.

GROSS: So what percentage of cancers are genetically passed on?

ROSS: People say 10 percent of cancers have an inherited component that we know of. There was a recent study - it was called the Nortrac (ph) study in Norway and other countries in that area. They looked at identical twins versus fraternal twins and looked at their cancer incidents.

So if you looked at an identical twin and it had cancer and then its other twin had cancer, how frequent was that compared to the fraternal, where they're not identical genetically? And from that, they did a lot of mathematical gimcrackery, something like that, discovered that 33 percent of the common cancers have a genetic component, meaning an inherited component that contributes to their cancer.

GROSS: That's pretty high. And what happens to the genes when it's not an inherited issue? Like, if the genes are still causing cancer, what do we know about how they're transformed during the course of a person's life?

ROSS: Well, the genes that are important in causing cancer - in that, we call it the sporadic situation. It's like you have a blueprint. Your blueprint is what you inherit. And then on the blueprint, there's a renovation, and it's a malignant renovation. And the malignant renovation is these other genes - oncogenes are formed, translocations are formed where a gene becomes too active. And it can cause the cell to proliferate and proliferate and proliferate. And more mutations occur as it proliferates liberates.

Every time a cell divides, it has to copy its DNA. And every time it copies its DNA, there's a mistake here or there. And sometimes that mistake's not fixed. And so we get more and more mutations. And when you get mutations and genes that prevent the cell from dying, so it just keeps surviving, causes it to invade organs, causes it to survive in an organ it shouldn't survive in, that's when you get cancer. And those are sporadic mutations added on to your blueprint.

GROSS: If you're having a preemptive double mastectomy to preventer yourself from getting breast cancer, you're exposing yourself to a lot of risk. That's a pretty major surgery. Convince me that it's really worth the risk when you don't know what the odds are for sure that you would get breast cancer, but you do know for sure if you have the double mastectomy or exposing yourself to the risk of infection to, like, if you want reconstructive surgery, you're exposing yourself to the risk of several surgeries. It's going to take a toll on your body. You know for certain that that's going to happen.

ROSS: Yes, you do. But a mastectomy - you know, bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction puts you at some risk for, like you said, infections and side effects and issues. But if you have a 50 to 80 percent chance of getting a breast cancer that's going to kill you, weighing at the pros and cons there, I think the mastectomy is the way to go because then you prevent that. You go from, you know, a 50 to 80-percent chance down to maybe a 5 percent chance if some cells are left over. And you have a nice long life. You know, if you do the math, it's not so bad.

I have to say, you know, mastectomies are not a big surgery. The oophorectomy is a little bit more complicated because you're taking out the ovaries and you have all of a sudden instant menopause. And there are issues with that - you know, bone density issues, you know, health issues as well as quality-of-life issues, hot flashes, those kind of things. But still, it's a lot better than the alternative, the alternative of dying in your 40s or 50s.

GROSS: That's an alternative you witnessed with your sister.

ROSS: Yeah. Yes, with my sister and many patients who've had these mutations.

Oncologist Theodora Ross discusses the hereditary nature of cancer and her own predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer, which led her to have a double mastectomy and to have her ovaries removed.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. If you have a history of cancer in your family, you may be wondering if you should get a genetic test to see if you have any genetic mutations that might predispose you to cancer. My guest has had a lot of experience with that issue, professionally and personally. Dr. Theodora Ross directs the Cancer Genetics Program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. She is an oncologist who specializes in treating breast cancer, and she directs a research lab focusing on how cancer genes turn normal cells into cancer cells.

In spite of her knowledge and in spite of the history of cancer in her family including her uncle, father, mother, brother and sister, she didn't get tested until she was diagnosed with a melanoma. The melanoma was successfully treated but it scared her into wanting to know if she had the so-called breast cancer gene. After getting tested, she found out she had that gene. We'll hear what she did in response a little later. Dr. Ross has written a book that's part memoir, part medical science, called, ""A Cancer In The Family.""

Dr. Theodora Ross, welcome to FRESH AIR. So I have never gotten a kind of genetic testing that you've gotten, so I do not know if I'm genetically predisposed to cancer. I'm not sure I want to know. For me it, a little bit of self-deception is probably - (laughter), is maybe a healthy thing. You're an advocate of testing. You direct a cancer genetics program yet you put off getting tested yourself for years in spite of a history of cancer in your family. So why did you put it off for so long?

THEODORA ROSS: I was around the edges of trying to understand my own family's history of cancer. We were in a study by a research institution. I talked to a genetic counselor and asked them if they knew anything. And, it's interesting, they said it was not clearly hereditary in our family, but I changed the words around and told my fiance at the time that it was clearly not hereditary, and we went ahead and got married. But within the first year of getting married, I came down with melanoma, and at that point, I think, was when that denial went away.

And I decided to talk to another friend who was a genetics expert at The Ohio State University, and they evaluated me. I got tested. And I can just say it really changed how I saw things. So I went from this state of constant uncertainty and not knowing to knowing, and it was exhilarating. It was...

GROSS: Exhilarating? Scary is a word that comes to mind for me. (Laughter).

ROSS: It was exhilarating because all of a sudden, we discovered we had a particular mutation, a BRCA1 mutation, going throughout our family that certainly was a contributor to my sister's death and...

GROSS: Your sister died of breast cancer.

ROSS: Breast cancer, yes. In her 30s.

GROSS: So you mentioned you were diagnosed with melanoma before getting genetically tested. That was treated surgically and that...

ROSS: Exactly, it was tiny melanoma. (Laughter).

GROSS: OK so you were done with that, but then you got tested, found out that you tested positive for the so-called breast cancer gene, which also left you predisposed to ovarian cancer. So after getting this information and thinking it through, you decided to have a double mastectomy and to have both of your ovaries removed. How did you reach that decision?

ROSS: Well, once I figured out I had the mutation, it was pretty clear because I think I'd been thinking about it for years. You know, being a doctor, being an oncologist, seeing the data, I'd been thinking about it. So I was already prepared, plus I'd seen my sister go through this and other people in the family go through these things. And so for me, it was an instant decision - I don't want to get that, I don't want to go through that, and the data is really good for that preventing cancer. So it was a pretty quick decision for me. Many patients, it's not. It takes them some time.

GROSS: So you had the surgery done. How long ago was that?

ROSS: That was in 2004. So 12 years ago.

GROSS: So how effective was getting the double mastectomy and the - getting your ovaries removed? How effective was that in diminishing your fear of getting cancer?

ROSS: A hundred percent. (Laughter). I mean, I - of course, I could have a relapse or I could get a new melanoma, if that's caused by this BRCA mutation. I could have cancer, yes. But the reality is, is I probably have a lower risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer than the general population.

GROSS: So you tried to understand the source of your genetic predisposition to cancer. Your father and your mother had cancer. One of your uncles had cancer. Your sister died of cancer. Your brother had cancer. So - but you were assuming that since Ashkenazi Jews are especially prone to have this genetic predisposition, and since your father is Jewish and your mother not, you assumed that this gene came from your father's side of the family. But in doing your genetic research, you learned something very interesting about your mother's family. What did you learn?

ROSS: Well, yes, it was really quite shocking. So, you know, Mother's always right, as they say. So when we discovered that I had the mutation, we went to visit her. We had Sunday dinner with her and we were talking to her about it and telling her that this came from her late husband's side of the family, certainly, since he was a Jew.

And she said, no, that's not the case. And we said, no, it is the case. And she also didn't get the idea that my brothers each had a 50 percent chance of having this mutation. They hadn't been tested at that time, it was so early in this discovery. And as we were talking, it became clear that as part of this research study we were in, she had received a letter when my father was dying.

He was in hospice and so she kind of filed it away - but, a letter from them saying, we have new information for you. And when I got all the records from them and I'm reading through it, I find that they'd never tested my father. They'd tested my mom, and she was the one -the Polish Catholic - that carried his supposed Ashkenazi Jewish mutation.

GROSS: So what responsibility did you feel to the rest of your family when you found out that you had this gene? 'Cause if it runs in the family, do you have a responsibility to tell, like, you know, nieces and nephews and uncles and aunts and cousins? And, say they don't want to know?

ROSS: Yes, once you find out you've found a mutation, there is a responsibility to inform as many relatives as you can because you can save their life. When I first got the mutation information, I called my uncle - my dad's brother - because remember, he's Jewish and so we thought that's where the mutation was. And he's a psychiatrist and understands medicine.

And he, right away, even though he's Jewish and ultimately we would've found out it hadn't come from his family, he still tested to make sure because he's got four daughters and a son. And he turned it out to be negative, which was really great for them. My mother's side of the family, it's more difficult. We don't know people like my father's side of the family, and one of the hopefully exciting parts of this book will be that they'll read it and they'll find out they have a mutation and save their life.

GROSS: So you are a strong advocate of genetic testing, but not everybody needs to get tested? Like, who should get tested?

ROSS: I think it should start out with looking at your family. And a family history is so important, so hard to get. It's a noble cause to try to get an accurate family history. You'd be surprised how inaccurate our family histories are, including my own. I don't know if my aunt had ovarian cancer, or was it endometrial cancer? Everybody goes back and forth on that, and the records don't exist. But getting that family history is the first step before testing.

And if you find your family history has a strong, you know, component of cancer in it or of some other disease - heart disease or a neurologic disease - seeing a genetic specialist and flushing that out, they help you. They go through each step, they tell you what the issues are and whether or not you're really looking at this right. So it's an objective view. And then they can help you determine whether or not there's a specific gene or set of genes to figure out whether there is a genetic predisposition to your disease, cancer or otherwise.

GROSS: Why do you need to know this before getting tested? I mean, why can't you just give a sample and say, tell me what mutations I have?

ROSS: It's tough because we have 20,000 genes in our genome. We have lots of interspersed sequences. We have a very complex genome. So just sequencing your genome won't help you very much. If you're Ashkenazi Jewish then it is a reasonable thing to consider getting tested for the mutations with that heritage. So there are three BRCA mutations - BRCA1, two of them, and BRCA2, one of them - that are at a high enough frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish population that screening for those is a reasonable thing. I think it's 1 in 40.

And so those are reasonable getting without any family history - you're Ashkenazi Jewish, I'd test for those three. But in general, just testing people is kind of a random process and so the family history will tell you. And in addition to that, if your family history is, you know, very - there are lots of cancers - like, for example, Angelina Jolie had a BRCA1 mutation, and she had a very strong family history. With that, her risk is higher than somebody who has the same mutation but doesn't have a family history but has a large number of females in it. It's not just the mutation that contributes to the risk, it's also the amount of cancer in the family and how early those cancers occurred.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Dr. Theodora Ross. Her new book is called, ""A Cancer In The Family: Take Control Of Your Genetic Inheritance."" She leads the Cancer Genetics Program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and she leads a lab that investigates how cells transform from normal cells to cancer cells.

If you have prophylactic surgeries, the chances are you won't get breast cancer or you won't get ovarian cancer - pretty good chances. I mean, there's a very slight chance that you will, but you've reduced it by 95 to 99 percent.

It's not just that they cry more easily, and longer  which they do. There's also something strange  harsher and more pained  about the cries of many of these babies.

The realization that they even cry differently than normal babies drove home how many mysteries the world is facing because of the Zika virus.

Why would they cry differently? Like so many other things about these Zika babies, no one really knows.

But doctors are starting to try to get some answers  from babies like Davi Lucas Francisca da Paz. He's 4 months old.

I met Davi, crying in the arms of his mother, Eliane Francisca, in a crowded waiting room at the IMIP Hospital in Recife, Brazil.

IMIP doctors are caring for hundreds of babies suspected of having brain damage caused by their mothers getting infected with the mosquito-borne virus when they were pregnant. More than a dozen of these babies were coming in just that morning.

Francisca left home at dawn for a two-hour van ride into the city for Davi's monthly checkup. So she and her baby were already waiting on a hard plastic chair for hours.

Finally, the pediatrician, Dr. Danielle Cruz, called them. Davi starts wailing again as soon as they start heading to the exam room. Cruz tries to comfort Davi.

Davi's head is tiny. He has microcephaly, which doctors think Zika is causing. His brain is tiny, too. It's deformed and scarred in a distinctive pattern that seems unique to babies born to mothers who had Zika when they were pregnant.

Davi has other medical problems. His retinas are scarred, so he may be blind. He doesn't have the twisted arms and legs that some of these babies have. But his mother says he recently started having seizures. The convulsions come in waves  over and over again.

""It looks like he got really scared. His arms and his legs stretch out. And they get really stiff,"" his mother says.

The seizures last a few minutes, but ""for a mother it's an eternity,"" she says.

Cruz reassures her that epilepsy drugs should help.

Davi is crying again as Cruz carries him to an examining table. The baby doesn't seem to be deaf like a lot of these babies. So he calms down as Cruz starts playing some calming meditation music on her phone.

Hundreds of mothers are showing up with babies like Davi at hospitals and clinics all around this crowded city and other parts of Brazil.

As the babies are hitting their fourth, fifth, and sixth months, the seizures are starting, along with other complications, doctors say.

""Every day we are seeing something different,"" says Dr. Regina Coeli, a pediatrician at the Oswaldo Cruz Hospital, which is located nearby in Recife. Coeli is rushing from one baby to the next.

""Some of them they have convulsions. Others have kind of a reflux  vomiting, not eating,"" she says. As a result, the babies get progressively weaker.

""It's very sad. It's a very bad situation,"" she says.

While some of these babies don't seem too bad, most of the infants have really small heads.

""They are very small,"" she says. ""It's very grave.""

Many will be blind, deaf, and severely mentally and physically disabled, she says.

Evidence is emerging the virus may also cause a wide variety of serious birth defects.

But as bad as many of them are, I realize something else: Once you get over the shock of seeing their heads and hearing their cries, these babies are still babies. They're still cute.

Coeli agrees.

""I love them  all of my children here,"" she says.

Coeli and other doctors in Recife are tracking these babies to get a better idea of what's going to happen to them as the months and years go by. They know they can't predict based on the microcephaly they're used to seeing.

This new microcephaly is ""very different,"" Coeli says. ""So we have to study it.""

The researchers hope they can help mothers and doctors in Brazil and the rest of the world get a better idea of what to expect. How disabled will the children be? How long will they live? What kind of lives will they have?

Back at the IMIP Hospital, Davi's mother is finishing up with the pediatrician. Cruz prints out new prescriptions and stamps orders for more tests. That means Davi's mother, who doesn't have much money, had to give up her job to spend days going from doctor to doctor.

""I learn to be strong with him. I think these children teach us a lot,"" she says.

She acknowledges that it's exhausting, but notes that a smile goes a long way. ""It fills me up,"" she says. ""When I see my son smiling, it's all worth it.""

As she's leaving, I asked her what she thinks is going to happen to Davi.

""It's in the hands of God,"" she says.",[]

When Blake Shelton hosted Saturday Night Live last January, the writers cooked up a burlesque of a country music video. Judging from the wig and wardrobe choices, he and cast members Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant were meant to be facsimiles of Alan Jackson, Reba McEntire and Wynonna Judd, three veteran country stars teaming up on an inspirational ballad. For comedic effect, the actors brought hammy over-singing and folksy showbiz gloss to lyrics that exhorted listeners to embrace the metaphorical western boot of wish fulfillment within them, or some such hokum. As way-out as the sketch was, it leaned on a familiar perception of country music  one that's received plenty of other pop culture reinforcement.

Numerous country-singing contestants have held their own on the stages of American Idol and The Voice, where formidable voices and dramatic performances rule. Who can forget that it was Idol that launched Carrie Underwood? Ever since sweeping season four, she's been admired and beloved by audiences because of how she uses those powerhouse pipes of hers. By flexing her technical ability and telegraphing emotional and physical exertion with every boldfaced ballad and stomping kiss-off, she's embodied what many have long considered the country-pop singing ideal. If few other country singers have approached the athleticism of Underwood's instrument, many contemporary hit-makers in her format have built popular sounds on vigorous vocals and a muscled-up modern rock guitar attack. All of this has contributed to country music's reputation as powerfully hearty stuff, dedicated to the display of sincerity and showmanship  to making a show out of meaning it.

Lately, though, the tone of some mainstream country singing and songwriting has begun to relax considerably. ""My Church,"" a breezy slice of irreverence that just cracked the Top 5 of Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, is well on its way to establishing 25-year-old Maren Morris as a new breed of country-pop star. She sings low during the verses; there's a world-weary slouch to her enunciation, a coolness to her affect. But even when she scales the octave-higher hook, she's far from belting. ""In some of her choruses, she does actually sing in some range areas that are similar to a Carrie Underwood performance,"" notes vocal coach Sophie Shear, who works with budding singers in a variety of styles, country included, in her Nashville studio. ""However, she's not exerting; she's not pushing quite as much. ... So our brains perceive Maren as a more relaxed singer, even if they're singing the same notes.""

Just a few weeks ago, the duo Brothers Osborne scored a kindred Top 5 hit of its own with the Grammy-nominated, groove-driven roots-rock number ""Stay a Little Longer,"" a song put across by 32-year-old singer T.J. Osborne's rhythmically relaxed phrasing and capped off by 34-year-old John Osborne's extended guitar jam. Both the Osbornes and Morris are among the most buzzed-about acts in the format right now, and they're not the only ones giving country a more casual tone of voice. Also high on the charts are follow-up hits from Sam Hunt and Kelsea Ballerini, who've each had major country hits within the last year. Hunt is known for skating between R&B-indebted crooning and conversational rapping; Ballerini for her flip, self-possessed take on flirtation. And for every artist who's managed to score a hit in this vein, there are several others working toward a breakthrough, like Haley Georgia, who employed a winkingly acidic sung-spoken delivery on last year's ""Ridiculous,"" multi-talented Clare Dunn, who brings a clipped, staccato swagger to her current single ""Tuxedo,"" and newcomer Russell Dickerson, who works territory next door to Hunt's in ""Yours.""

There were signs of younger artists bringing a new casualness to country as far back as the summer of 2012, when Taylor Swift began sharpening the edges of her conversational delivery with one foot still firmly planted in Nashville. One of the most striking things about her single ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"" was the way her lyrics and vocal inflections conveyed millennial exasperation. Kacey Musgraves' debut single ""Merry Go Round"" arrived just a month later, introducing a young singer-songwriter who laced her work with reticent wit. What really grabbed attention, and convinced many music critics to anoint her country's socially progressive savior, was the subtle thumbs-up to same-sex attraction in her third single ""Follow Your Arrow."" Not that she presented her perspectives as being in any way radical for a twenty-something. To the contrary: one of the defining qualities of her songwriting voice is how thoroughly low-key it is. And in that way, she and Hunt share common ground; the way he broods over conflicted emotions in songs like ""Take Your Time"" and ""Break Up In a Small Town"" is, likewise, artfully mellow.

By the time the Country Music Association awards rolled around last November, the nonchalance of Hunt's vocal delivery had had enough of an impact within the industry to merit a joke from the show's co-hosts, Underwood and Brad Paisley. During the opening monologue, Paisley began to lurch erratically between talking and singing, setting Underwood up to ask what he was doing. Then came his droll punch line: ""I'm Hunting  Sam Hunting. You know, how he talks in his songs and then suddenly for sorta no reason starts singing, and the younger demographic just totally eats it up.""

When the next award show rolls around, Paisley could very well be cracking wise about the even-tempered appeal of Texas-bred Morris or the Maryland-born Brothers Osborne. The latter released their rewarding full-length debut Pawn Shop in mid-January on the heels of ""Stay a Little Longer,"" which serves as a good introduction to the sound they've achieved with super-producer Jay Joyce. For the better part of a decade, Joyce has been nudging mainstream country toward both live wire looseness and meticulous studio craft with his work on Eric Church and Little Big Town albums, in the process laying groundwork for the production and arrangement side of this trend. Joyce's way with digitally taut, down-home funkiness is central to the Osborne's easeful, pop-friendly sonic identity. John's extended vamp, worlds away from the contemporary country norm of aggressively streamlined guitar solos, fills a sizable chunk of his duo's hit. He teases a coiling, syncopated guitar figure into sprightly, note-bending runs, which stealthily taper off before bounding back. Patience is central to his playing style; he'd rather toy with the beat than attack it forcefully. ""A lot of times there's this big misunderstanding that if something is rocking or grooving, it has to be loud,"" John offers, reclining on a couch next to his younger brother in an office space maintained by their management company. ""I don't know where that happened along the way. It's like everyone's screaming for attention or something. But I mean, if you listen to a B.B. King record, it's just groove. If you listen to a Marvin Gaye record, those guys aren't playing loud. It's really laidback.""

Capitol Nashville's VP of A&R Autumn House  who's been involved with the Osbornes since before they were signed to the label  feels the descriptor ""laidback"" also fits the brothers themselves. ""They do energy in a different way,"" she says on the phone. ""Their influences are probably a little bit more rooted in that laidback place, The Band and The Allman Brothers and that kind of thing. ... I think if you grew up in a household that was playing that music, there might be some nostalgia for hearing those sounds again [from] two very current millennials.""

In ""Stay a Little Longer,"" T.J.'s vocal performance feels no more hurried than the instrumental accompaniment. Elsewhere on the album, his phrasing and enunciation grow even more elastic, his delivery occasionally taking on a slyly poker-faced quality. In ""Rum,"" he coolly elongates his syllables. In the album's title track, his low-pitched drawl drags across the cavernous depths of his range. ""He is naturally falling in to a lower register,"" notes Shear, the vocal coach. ""His vocal chords are really thick. He's got a very big chest voice, a large larynx. He's using his natural abilities really well in just kind of talking through some of his words."" Watch him sing up close, and you'll find he looks like he's barely even opening his mouth. ""And that's probably not something he's doing with a lot of intention,"" Shear wagers. ""He's probably just trying to keep it cool.""

In their songwriting, the Osbornes tackle some familiar country themes  booze; making the best of modest means; stoking the heat of a hookup  but tend toward wry understatement. Where country songs that champion small-town ways of life have often been defiant in posture, their bravado registering resistance to classist condescension, the brothers' nods to budget-priced whiskey and junky old cars rusting in the yard come off more as playful, unperturbed, even a little bit arch. That easygoing writerly voice goes hand in hand with their sound.

It's taken a number of years for the Osbornes' sensibilities to align with the mainstream country vanguard. As teenagers in Deale, Md., they played many a grueling set in a bar band with their dad before moving to Nashville, where they separately weathered failed bands, short-lived publishing deals and guitar tech and side man gigs before committing themselves to their songwriting and performing duo. After developing their repertoire, they watched as first a 2013 single, then a 2014 EP barely made ripples in the marketplace. ""What we do now, what our album Pawn Shop is, is just the music that we play,"" says T.J. ""We didn't compromise anything. ... It's funny to see how country music has progressed so much in the past five years. When we started playing, [what we were doing] was definitely very progressive. We were doing songs that were, in my mind, pretty far ahead of what a lot of people were doing at the time. So I think things kind of caught up to what we were doing.""

As young as she is, Morris's breakthrough moment was a long time in the making, too. She came to Nashville with a decade of experience independently releasing albums and gigging in and around the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area. Then she put her recording career aside to focus on learning the collaborative, professionalized craft of Music Row songwriting. Songs that she co-wrote made it onto albums by Tim McGraw and Kelly Clarkson. Gradually, though, Morris accumulated material for a project of her own. ""I found my voice in those writing rooms,"" she explains, perched on a bar stool at a neighborhood pub. ""I started to just hear this voice. It was my voice, but also  I didn't know it at the time  just a point of view and identity behind these songs that was this quiet confidence. I feel like I would describe myself as [having] that, because I'm not the person capturing the attention at a party.""

Morris made the savvy decision to self-release her EP through Spotify last fall, and the response it received  2.5 million streams within weeks  motivated her now-label Columbia Nashville to rush ""My Church"" to country radio and commission her addictive upcoming album, Hero. (Morris co-produced it with busbee, whose past credits bridge country and pop.) In ""My Church,"" Morris shrugs off the notion that choosing to cruise to the car radio rather than warm a pew makes her a heathen. And it's hard to imagine a franker, more coolheaded breakup speech than the one she gives in ""I Wish I Was,"" a youthful angle on Bonnie Raitt-style, R&B-pop balladry: ""Go on hate me if you have to,"" she insists. ""I hate myself too."" During a recent performance at the Ryman Auditorium, she introduced it as a song for those who ""can relate to being a bad guy."" That and ""Company You Keep""  a toast to the idea that it's the people, not the poshness of the setting, who make the party  are about as close as she gets to romance on her EP.

She expands her low-stakes perspective on love on the new album, likening a hookup to a bad habit too trivial to kick (the flippantly, fluently syncopated ""Just Another Thing"") and acknowledging a distrust of mushiness (the wistful ballad ""I Could Use a Love Song""). In the chorus of the latter, she articulates a clear-eyed, decidedly twenty-something perspective. ""I could use a love song,"" she sings, but she's not looking for just any sweet, little ditty. What she wants is to be transported back to a dreamier time ""when I wouldn't roll my eyes at a guy and a girl who make it work in a world that, for me, so far, just seems to go so wrong.""

In person, Morris explains, ""I see this gap happening in the market where the only time I hear a girl sing on the radio, it's a love song  or it's like a 'fuck you' love song. I felt like I live in the middle of those worlds, where I don't wanna feel extreme in either way. It's OK to be a young adult in [your] 20s and not have to worry about getting married or getting pregnant, having a baby. I'm in that window right now."" She goes on, ""Not to say that I don't love songs that are a kiss-off or a great love song. I'm not trying to bash that at all. I think just where my head was at when we wrote this record, I wasn't there and I didn't want to feel like I had to be. ... You can be honest without being earnest.""

Morris proves her point in the girl group pop update ""Drunk Girls Don't Cry."" ""It's bulls*** and you know it,"" she sings. ""Yeah, I see it in your eyes every time that you tell me deep down he's a really good guy.""

""She speaks to you in a way that is relatable,"" observes Carla Wallace, co-owner and GM of Morris's publishing company, Big Yellow Dog Music. ""It's like you're her best friend."" Wallace jokingly compares Morris's appeal to that of Rizzo, the tough-talking, streetwise female ringleader in Grease. ""She's just cool as s***,"" laughs Wallace. ""You want to smoke a cigarette with her, even if you don't smoke.""

That effect is only enhanced by Morris's delivery of ""Drunk Girls."" Between the unfussy resolve of her enunciation and the way she milks the lower part of her range, it's the aural equivalent of an eye roll. Says Shear, ""We're noticing more of a demand for almost kind of a masculine vocal sound, lower pitches, slower vocal movements, what we call vocal fry, which is basically a slower vibrational speed of the vocal chords."" But as Shear is careful to point out, the country mainstream is hardly the only segment of the pop music landscape where youthful vocal approaches are evolving away from ""polish."" ""I think smoother, cleaner and 'prettier' kinds of sounds, they just remind us of an older generation,"" she says.

The thing is that the country radio format is deliberately aimed at a multi-generational audience  say, kids fresh out of high school, their empty-nesting parents and young professionals and working folks who fall in between. There's a continual give-and-take between the tastes of different age groups while new aesthetic contributions get combined with countrified conventions and absorbed into the melange by adaptable artists. The rise of this casual posture is one of many signs of a new shift in mainstream country's center of gravity  a shift toward youthful negotiations of the divide between resilient small-town identity and plugged-in, 21st Century fluidity. Even country stars who established themselves as robust performers years ago, like Underwood and Dierks Bentley, are experimenting with different vocal approaches. In Bentley's current single, ""Somewhere on a Beach,"" he strikes a cavalier posture with his loosened phrasing, and in Underwood's ballad ""Heartbeat""  featuring harmonies from Hunt and recorded with his cowriter-producer Zach Crowell  she comes on more coyly than you'd expect until the titanic chorus.

There's an element of skill involved in an artist recalibrating the tone of her expression, just as it requires skill to massage a naturally laidback musical approach into mainstream appeal. It's worth noting that leading up to their success, Morris and the Osbornes  along with Musgraves, her guitarist Misa Arriaga, Idol runner-up Kree Harrison, hot-picking country singer Charlie Worsham, British pop chanteuse Lucie Silvas, who's now married to John Osborne, and numerous others  were part of a circle of young songwriters who were proud to claim the bohemian enclave of East Nashville, the symbolic antithesis of the country music industry headquartered just across the Cumberland River, as their home turf. ""East Nashville's kind of the quirky part of Nashville,"" John Osborne explains. ""There's a lot of originality here. A lot of artists are over here. It's just kind of a breeding ground for people that want to be individuals. ...Even though it's only, like, a five minute drive from Music Row [the neighborhood where recording industry power has historically been centralized], you're able to kinda get out of the music business world for a little bit and just live in a town.""

If the division between those two worlds has never truly been as tidy as it's made out to be, learning to straddle them surely furthered Morris and the Osbornes' development as artists bent on mastering and cleverly tweaking country's formulas and on packaging their distinct voices and vantage points for a popular audience. Important musical experimentation  or what T.J. Osborne calls ""some of the most creatively fertile moments of my life""  happened while they were just hanging out at somebody's house, layering snippets of melodies, lyrics and licks with a looping pedal, teasing offhand ideas into expansive productions.

What they're bringing into the mainstream with them now is a different angle on one of country's core values: authenticity. They work to make it feel like their fully realized performances still retain some of the conversational qualities of living room jams. For a new generation of music-makers, that's a subtler way of signaling that they mean it.",[]

To borrow from a Jack Kerouac album title, the lyrics to Dana Falconberry's ""Cormorant"" feel like an amalgam of blues and haikus. The Dearborn-bred/Austin-based troubadour is adept at using natural imagery, and on this stand-out track from her new album, From the Forest Came the Fire, the themes and concision of haikus blend with the simple AAB format of traditional blues within Falconberry's personalized indie-folk and chamber-pop framework.

Over the gentle picking of banjo and pizzicato cello, Falconberry's cool, crystalline tones quietly deliver verses that put her in an undefined relationship to natural environments, a relationship that seems to shift as the song goes along. In the first few verses, she is aloft with avian associations, being ""as pale as a white bird"" at the start and watching ""a cormorant in flight,"" the simple intelligence of the imagery beautifully reflecting the sparseness of the production. But then the whole track opens up with a flurry of plangent electric guitar lines, syncopated drum patterns, and wordless vocal harmonies. By the time the dynamics are dialed back down for the next set of verses, Falconberry's perspective has altered. She has either become the cormorant or is desperately wishing that she could.

Cormorants are birds associated with coastal areas, and are known for their diving ability  but the narrator ""couldn't breathe below the deep sea."" By the point in the song when she finally manages a successful transformation from her human form, the bird has already come and gone, and the narrator's washed up on the beach, declaring in the final verse, ""I am a snail shell, I am an old leaf."" We can imagine the cormorant soaring back into the sky, probably with a prized fish in its beak, while our story-teller watches from below, part of what's been left behind in the bird's wake. We're left to wonder what she might have gained from this journey, as Falconberry's band, Medicine Bow, amps up again for the jubilant coda. Then the track leaves off with a combination of percussive clatter and guitar feedback that might just contain the flutter and cry of any number of airborne creatures.

From the Forest Came the Fire is out on April 1 on Modern Outsider.

In the eastern part of Syria, forces backed by the U.S. and its allies say they are pushing ISIS back. And U.S. officials say those forces are becoming more cohesive, and it turn more successful.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

Peace talks about Syria are due to begin today after two weeks of a shaky cease-fire there. But that cease-fire does not apply to the fight against ISIS. In the east of Syria, forces backed by the U.S. and its allies say they are pushing ISIS back, and U.S. officials say those forces are becoming more cohesive and effective. NPR's Alice Fordham has spent the last few days in Syria, and she was able to reach a town recently retaken from ISIS. She joins us now from Syria. Good morning.

ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: Good morning, Renee.

MONTAGNE: Now, I gather you visited a town that had been retaken from ISIS just recently - a couple of weeks ago - and met some of those U.S.-backed forces. But tell us first what you saw.

FORDHAM: Well, the town is called Shadadi. My initial impression, actually, was that it looked like ISIS had left there without much of a fight in that particular area, which I should also say is a very rural, small town, but it is important because it's strategically located on the highway between the ISIS-held city of Mosul in Iraq and their Syrian stronghold of Raqqah. And they had a tight hold on it for about two years. I met some people there who stayed through the whole period when ISIS was in charge. They were very clear that they were under the group's total control.

MONTAGNE: And they must have had some stories.

FORDHAM: Yes, they did indeed. They appeared very relieved to see the back of ISIS. You know, we'd actually just been standing in the middle of town looking at a sign that ISIS had put up urging women to cover their faces and their hands and their whole bodies. And we were just picking our way through the debris going around a corner. And there were two women sitting outside - a mom and her daughter - wearing colorful clothes and loose headscarves. And the mom was an older woman, and she was just laughing when she met us, showing all these gold teeth. And she seemed exuberant.

MONTAGNE: So it sounds like the town is coming back quite a bit even just since these last couple of weeks since it was retaken.

FORDHAM: Very, very slowly, actually. The people who were there who had stayed under ISIS are kind of hardy souls. Most people had left. And we only saw a very few people on their way back. The fighting does seem to be over for now. Those U.S.-backed forces advanced about 10 miles further down the road, and they said they've now stopped. They're digging a trench. There are still some unexploded bombs being cleared. Water and electricity are yet to be restored. So that could be a factor, but it's still definitely spookily deserted.

MONTAGNE: But then who now is controlling this town of Shadadi?

FORDHAM: Well, this is a very relevant question and it is where things get complicated. So Shadadi is an almost entirely Arab area. Now, the forces that the U.S. backs with airstrikes and with ammunition, they're called the Syrian Democratic Forces, and they're dominated by ethnic Kurds. And there have been concerns that as these Kurdish forces start to retake Arab areas from ISIS, they won't be welcomed because Arab residents might think that the Kurds are trying to expand their area of influence. So the U.S. and others has been trying very hard to incorporate Arab fighters into these forces - Arab fighters and some of the other minorities here.

MONTAGNE: And has that worked?

FORDHAM: Well, I've spoken with commanders here - Arab commanders and others within these anti-ISIS forces, and they insisted that they made sure that there were Arabs on the frontline moving into that Arab area of Shadadi. Now, that may be true but a couple of weeks later, before most people have come back, we only saw Kurdish forces there. They were speaking Kurdish, they were flying the flag of their Kurdish faction and not of these unified Syrian democratic forces. And another thing maybe worth noting, Renee, is that there were few of these forces. I saw maybe a couple dozen inside the town itself. You know, as these anti-ISIS forces are advancing, they're now spread out over a wide area in Syria. And just in the last few days, we've seen ISIS carry out attacks against them in different corners of the country maybe testing these slightly stretched forces.

MONTAGNE: NPR's Alice Fordham is speaking to us from Syria. Thank you very much.

FORDHAM: Thanks for having me, Renee.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday he has ordered the withdrawal of the majority of Russian troops from Syria. The pullout, which he said was coordinated with Syrian President Bashar Assad, is slated to begin Tuesday.

Speaking in a meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Putin said the objective of Russia's intervention  disrupting ISIS and other terror groups  had ""been fulfilled,"" and had laid the groundwork for more intense peace talks.

""I believe that the task put before the defence ministry and Russian armed forces has, on the whole, been fulfilled,"" Putin said, according to the Guardian. ""With the participation of the Russian military ... the Syrian armed forces and patriotic Syrian forces have been able to achieve a fundamental turnaround in the fight against international terrorism and have taken the initiative in almost all respects.""

Russia has long been a supporter of Assad's regime. Critics of Russia's presence in the country say Russian troops were involved in fighting the Syrian opposition groups, not just terrorists.

Putin said that Russia's Hmeimim air base and its Mediterranean naval base would continue to operate normally.

President Obama spoke to Putin on Monday afternoon, the White House said in a statement. They discussed Putin's announcement and the ""next steps required to fully implement the cessation of hostilities with the goal of advancing the political negotiations on resolution of the conflict.""

The statement said Obama ""welcomed the much-needed reduction in violence since the beginning of the cessation, but stressed that continuing offensive actions by Syrian regime forces risk undermining"" the peace process.

Other U.S. officials are tempering their reactions to the announcement, according to Reuters, saying they had seen no indications so far of preparations by Russia's military for the withdrawal.

Putin's announcement comes as a Russian and U.S.-brokered cease-fire that began last month has largely held, though the Syrian government and the opposition have each cited violations by the other side. ISIS and the al-Qaida branch operating in Syria are not part of the cease-fire agreement.

The withdrawal also comes amid peace talks in Geneva aimed at resolving the 5-year-old Syrian conflict.

Putin said Monday's move would send a ""good signal"" to the parties to the conflict, help raise trust and help serve as a stimulus for Syria's political talks, the Associated Press reports.

The talks are expected to focus on a political transition in Syria, which has been a major sticking point for the various parties. Russia and the Syrian regime have been adamant about keeping Assad in power, while the U.S. and Syrian opposition groups demand a new government.",[]

Prolific and multifaceted British composer and conductor Peter Maxwell Davies died Monday at age 81 at his home in the Orkney Islands, off the northern coast of Scotland. His death, from leukemia, was reported on the websites of both his publisher and his management company.

Called the ""harlequin of British music"" for more than five decades in a tribute by author Paul Griffiths, Maxwell Davies leaves a trove of varied works. Within some 300 pieces, there are 10 symphonies (hailed by the Times of London as ""the most important symphonic cycle since Shostakovich""), concertos, operas, song cycles, chamber music of all kinds, ballets, choral pieces and music for children. His latest work, The Hogboon, an opera for children, will debut with the London Symphony Orchestra June 26. He'll be remembered for both his controversial, expressionistic early works and later, more lyrical pieces incorporating elements of folk music, such as An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise, a 1985 tone poem that features bagpipes.

One of the composer's more recent concertos inspired by seascapes near his island home of Sanday, Orkney is Fiddler on the Shore, written for violinist Daniel Hope, who premiered the piece at the 2009 BBC Proms concerts with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.

""His music had a romantic and yet robust expression, which was particularly endearing,"" Hope wrote in an email. ""He was a great composer, a fine musician and a true gent. He also had an extremely wicked sense of humor and a way of looking at the world that was refreshingly original. He'll be greatly missed.""

Maxwell Davies was born Sept. 8, 1934 in Salford, just outside Manchester. Composing seemed to come naturally for him. He wrote his first pieces in 1942 while still learning to play the piano. Later he studied at the Royal Manchester College of Music, Princeton University and Manchester University, where he helped form a coterie of like-minded composers interested in the latest serial techniques  including Harrison Birtwistle and Alexander Goehr  known as the New Music Manchester group.

With a keen ear on the popular modernists of the times, such as Pierre Boulez, Maxwell Davies was also deeply influenced by the masters of the past, especially choral music from the English Renaissance. In 1962 he began in earnest the composing of his opera Taverner, inspired by 16th-century composer John Taverner. The music and ideas in the opera folded back on themselves and triggered a period of ""parody and distortion"" in his music, as Griffiths describes it.

At this time Maxwell Davies was beginning to earn his first important commissions, including one for the popular Proms concert series in London. He was also finishing up his directorship of music at the Cirencester Grammar School, initiating his longstanding dedication to music education in Britain.

Not everyone took the composer's music to heart, at least right away. As reported by the BBC, people shouted ""rubbish"" at the 1969 premiere of his music-theater work Eight Songs for a Mad King. And earlier today in an email Griffiths recalled attending the debut of the composer's Worldes Blis: Motet for Orchestra, which inspired much of the audience to walk out in protest.

The year 1971 marked a turning point in the composer's music, coinciding with his move to the austere landscapes of the Orkney Islands. Maxwell Davies began writing music in a more relaxed vein, inspired by his surroundings, in pieces such as the song cycle Stone Litany, the chamber symphony A Mirror of Whitening Light and the solo piano piece Farewell to Stromness, part of The Yellow Cake Revue, a musical protest in cabaret form against uranium mining in the Orkney Islands.

Maxwell Davies was showered with honors, including knighthood in 1987. In 2004 he was appointed Master of the Queen's Music, a 10-year position, and in 2014 he was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honor. The composer also thrived as a conductor, and held positions with the BBC Philharmonic and Royal Philharmonic. He regularly led top orchestras around the world, and for 20 years directed his own chamber ensemble, Fires of London.

Although he lived in a solitary place, Maxwell Davies believed composers should interact with society at large. It was a belief, Griffiths writes, that ""took him from working as a school music master when he was in his mid-twenties to serving as Master of the Queen's Music through his seventies. Answering an evident need, wherever it came from, he could compose a musical play for young children or a birthday ode for the monarch with the same care and relish he brought to a string quartet or an opera.""",[]

Go to any pharmacy or grocery store and stand in front of the toothpaste aisle and you will face an overwhelming array of choices. Each brand has a plethora of options

PATTI NEIGHMOND, BYLINE: And I'm Patti Neighmond in Los Angeles. One of the best things you can do to prevent tooth decay is brush your teeth well and floss every day. But choosing a toothpaste can be overwhelming.

LARRY KOZEK: Toothpaste, look at that.

NEIGHMOND: I'm standing in a local pharmacy with my dentist Dr. Larry Kozek. We're looking at rows and rows of toothpaste.

KOZEK: I remember when toothpaste used to be toothpaste.

NEIGHMOND: What do you mean?

KOZEK: Well, it was white, it tasted like peppermint. Now we have a whole menu of items in there. We're afraid not to put things in toothpaste. We're afraid it won't sell if it doesn't have everything in it.

NEIGHMOND: Well, exactly, 'cause what are we looking at? Truly radiant, sensitive, daily repair, advanced whitening.

KOZEK: Pro-health, my goodness - radiant white.

NEIGHMOND: But does all this do anything or is it hype to sell the product?

KOZEK: Let's see, can we read some of these ingredients?

NEIGHMOND: Yeah.

KOZEK: Water, zorbitrol, hydrated silica, poloxamer 407.

NEIGHMOND: Moisturizers, flavorings, coloring. But Kozek says the single most important ingredient is fluoride.

KOZEK: Because fluoride is the ingredient that hardens the enamel and makes the tooth more resistant to the acids of the bacteria in the mouth.

NEIGHMOND: And there are different types of fluoride.

KOZEK: Sodium fluoride and stannous fluoride. And it's pretty well accepted that the stannous fluoride is more effective. So if I were looking for a toothpaste and wanted the basic protection and basic care, I would look for a toothpaste that had stannous fluoride in it.

NEIGHMOND: When you were reading that list of ingredients, was that among them?

KOZEK: I didn't see that in any of those (laughter).

NEIGHMOND: So let's see if we can grab another one and see if it has stannous fluoride in it.

KOZEK: OK, well, let's take this here.

NEIGHMOND: This one didn't contain it either. Another important ingredient, he says, triclosan to fight bacteria that causes tartar. Some worry this chemical is contributing to antibiotic resistance. And if you have sensitive teeth, desensitizing toothpaste does work.

And the whiteners, do they work?

KOZEK: Everybody likes to have white teeth. And we find that the whiteners that are added to the toothpaste and to the mouthwash over time tend to be able to help people keep their teeth whiter but strictly a cosmetic.

NEIGHMOND: And, of course, floss.

KOZEK: The singularly - the most important feature of cleaning our teeth. Which works better, waxed dental floss, plain dental floss, glide dental floss? As long as we mechanically are able to use this string to dislodge the film of plaque on the teeth, we're doing an effective job.

NEIGHMOND: Kozek recommends flossing first, followed by brushing. Patti Neighmond, NPR News.

i toggle caption Scott Gries/Getty Images Scott Gries/Getty Images

It used to be that marriage was when adulthood began for American women. Moving straight out of their parents' house (or a college dorm) and into a house with a husband was simply the expected, preordained path for many women.

But in the past few decades, wedding rings have become optional accessories. And as the American single woman flourished, she also profoundly changed (and is still changing) the economy, politics and the basic social fabric of the U.S.

At least, that's what Rebecca Traister argues in her new book, All the Single Ladies. Traister, who considers herself a ""liberal feminist,"" spoke to NPR about the political shifts that single women are creating, as well as how feminism is factoring into the 2016 election.

Interview Highlights

What are the biggest ways single women are shaping the country?

It shifts all kinds of things about the country. It certainly shifts our definition of what family looks like. There's been what they call the ""great crossover,"" where the median age of first childbearing is now lower than the median age of first marriage.

The notion of having a baby without being married has moved from being something that's so stigmatized  now, of course it is still stigmatized; I don't want to pretend that it's not  but this is a total revision when it comes to social expectations, the notion of what makes a family, how to design parenthood.

So it shapes our idea of what families can look like, and I think it's done that in tandem with a gay rights movement that obviously has expanded definitions of families and parenthood and marriage to include same-sex couples.

And then there's this whole world of social policy, which I argue is really tied to changing marriage patterns, and in ways that don't seem obvious perhaps.

For example, I can't believe how central it is to what we talk about regularly, because it was third rail like five minutes ago, but for example, the push for paid family leave.

In part, this comes from it being pushed by people who are close to power. In part, this comes from when changed marriage patterns sort of trickle up and become a mass behavior that is now happening within more economically privileged realms, and what you get are women and men who have these careers and they're marrying later, and their children are coming in the midst of these careers, and they're hitting the bump of, ""Wait a minute. We don't have paid leave.""

You're also seeing an enormous number of low-income women who are having kids on their own, and the fact that they don't have paid leave is far more economically devastating for them because they have to go back to work right away.

So you have this kind of crisis that is born of a normalized female independence. And that is forcing a crisis, where it's actually forcing us to address it with social policy.

I would say also things like rise in the minimum wage. I believe almost two-thirds of minimum wage earners are women, many of them single.

So the drive to raise the minimum wage in part comes from a country in which women are now supporting themselves independently.

And even when it comes down to how long are American school days? School gets out at 3. Tax breaks for people who are married.

Those policies assume that there is a wage-earning person, presumed probably to be a man, and a domestic person in a given household. And the person who does the domestic labor is doing so for no wages or for low wages. That is no longer the case.

The flip side of the discussion of the social safety net is the idea that marriage solves poverty.

Well and that's the big push from conservatives. Look, there are lots of factors that combine. Women's entrance into the workforce all by itself is a big part of this. Of course, women's entrance into the workforce also enables women to live outside of marriage much more freely.

But one of the ways you know that it's changing marriage patterns that might be at the heart of this is because that's what Republicans are freaking out about. So the enormous conservative push for not only everyone should get married but you should get married early, which is something Mitt Romney has emphasized. Jeb Bush ... wrote a [1995] book saying that the reason that we have a problem is that more single mothers aren't shamed to have their out of wedlock children. [On the campaign trail last year, Bush said he wanted to shame fathers who abandon their kids, but not mothers.]

The amount of money that during the Bush administration  and then it's continued into the Obama administration  has poured into marriage education programs, with the idea that marriage would solve poverty. This is a completely backwards policy idea. [The Obama administration has continued to fund marriage education but has also shifted the focus more directly onto fatherhood, as the Christian Science Monitor has reported.]

You know, some Republicans are trying to take playful aim at unmarried women. You saw that with the Republican gubernatorial ad campaign from 2014, I believe, where it was like ""Say Yes to the Dress,"" but it was ""Say yes to Rick Scott.""

Oh right. I remember that.

And that was also the year that [Fox News' Jesse Watters] called single women ""Beyonce voters"" and said they just want to use the government as their husband. This is the right-wing talking point about privileged single women, which is they just want a hubby state where the government does what husbands used to do.

By the way, that's not untrue! Because the government for a long time has supported men. This is a thing we never talk about. The government has supported male dominance in a whole lot of ways, by not effectively protecting equal pay [and] through housing loans and subsidizing men's college educations through the G.I. bill for a long time.

There are all kinds of ways in which especially white men in this country have been helped by the government.

But on the flip side you're seeing some ways men could use a boost these days  specifically, the argument that the Earned Income Tax Credit should help single, childless men more.

That's exactly right, but that's another example of a readjustment of social policy in response to totally altered marriage and familial patterns.

And there's this sense of like, wait a minute  our government benefits must better reflect what the citizenry actually looks like.

And so to some extent, if the idea is that women, for example, would have kids and get to take their time to be with their kids because they would be dependent on an earning husband who is getting tax breaks for being married and having a kid  that is no longer the case. Women are no longer necessarily married to that husband  they are maybe themselves the earner. They are either single or they are a crucial half or more of their marital economy.

Then you have to demand different kinds of support from the government than the kinds that just supported the male-breadwinner-female-domestic model.

Clearly all women aren't the same  it feels wrong to lump all single women together when there are huge class divides. But what's interesting is that you talk about it trickling up, as opposed to down the chain.

But that's true of so many things, and it's a pattern that's repeated over and over again  so for example, the act of women working for wages, which has been an economic necessity for women, and certainly most poor women forever.

There may be many benefits to working outside the home for wages, but it's certainly not been done as an act of liberation. It's an act of economic necessity and has been since the beginning of time.

However, when that behavior trickles up to middle class and often predominantly white women, it becomes discernible as liberation.

When the women for whom it's not an economic necessity can see that there are various kinds of freedoms in it and power, then we can see it as part of the feminist revolution of the 1970s that white women moved into workplaces.

So I would argue that there's a very similar pattern in terms of not marrying. Once you get wealthier women  who by the way with their singlehood, because they have more resources, are able to capitalize on many of the benefits of independence  on getting higher educations and bigger jobs and making more money, then it becomes a sort of glamorized thing.

And I understand the temptation to say, ""Right, well, the way that those Sex and the City women are living has nothing to do with the way that poor women are living,"" but I think that's a disservice both to the poor women and the wealthier women.

It casts poorer women just as victims, when in fact they were the pioneers of changing America's assumptions about how women's lives are supposed to go and about marriage patterns. And they were doing it because it's what they needed to do for their lives.

And the other thing that it does is it says, ""These flashy women don't count either, because they're just living this stupid, flashy life that's just about high heels and drinks.""

That's not true either. You don't want to discount the power that is wielded by privileged independent women, who are first of all closer to having influence when it comes to things like government and social policy, and also who are challenging powerful men for all kinds of power as they become more independent and their independence becomes more threatening.

So I have to back up and switch topics to Big Girls Don't Cry [Traister's 2010 book about women's prominent place in the 2008 election], because it seems so relevant today considering the ""mother-daughter divide"" everyone talks about among Democratic voters. What has changed since eight years ago?

Oh we're repeating a lot of what's true about what happened in 2008. Last month, [after controversial statements about gender from Gloria] Steinem and [Madeleine] Albright and Bill Clinton, it felt like a reunion of the not-helping brigade from 2008.

But I think the biggest positive change I can identify about [Hillary] Clinton's campaign this year is actually Clinton herself. I think she's running a much better campaign this year. I think her campaign is more functional. [But] it still has its challenges, especially sometimes with surrogates.

The reception of her continues to be very mixed and very difficult to talk about, especially when you're in the midst of it.

Because once again, everyone is still on a hair trigger. If you start to talk about the way gender plays into her self presentation or her reception or, for example, some of the things Bernie [Sanders] gets to do like promise revolution and shout, that probably a woman  and certainly not the first woman to come this close to the White House  would ever do.

That lady would not be a plausible presidential candidate: the one who's telling you you're going to have a big socialist revolution.

So if you start to talk about that, then tempers are so hot right now because people are lined up behind their candidates. And there are two really exciting candidates. Bernie and Hillary are both thrilling candidates.

I think it's wonderful that we have this contest right now. But people are so angry that if you begin to talk about the gender very quickly there's a reflexive ""this is not about sexism. This is about her shortcomings.""

I've loved [Clinton's] lines that she's given in debates and town halls where she's said, ""I'm very excited to see people so passionate about Bernie Sanders and so engaged in politics, and I hope to work to earn their vote.""

But then you have something like Steinem's I think accidental remark on Bill Maher that seemed so disrespectful to young women. And certainly Albright, who I don't think would have gotten as much play had it not happened after Gloria Steinem, because Madeleine Albright says that [""There's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other""] like every day of her life. And as has been reported, it's on a Starbucks cup.

I mean, it feels like a quote I've seen people Facebooking or social-media-ing or whatever for years. But in this context, it became a cudgel.

Well, I never thought the quote was inspirational. It's always one of my least favorite. I don't think total gender solidarity is ever a requirement. And I hate the notion that sisterhood somehow is supposed to quell disagreement between women.

Look. There is not a special place in hell for people who didn't support Sarah Palin. Do you know what I mean? It's ridiculous. And there is certainly not a special place in hell for women who don't support Hillary Clinton.

However, the fact is [Albright] says it Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday-Friday of every week, and it doesn't get much play. It was not invented by the Clinton campaign, nor was it invented for the Clinton campaign.

When I asked a Bernie Sanders supporter in Iowa if she had at all been tempted by the possibility of voting for a woman, she told me, ""I'm not voting with my vagina."" That phrase is kicked around these days, often in a bad way. So I'm wondering: Is it OK to vote for someone because she's a woman?

Sure. Of course. It's OK to vote for anybody for any reason.

This is the fog of war stuff. It's the middle of a very heated campaign. Everybody is very invested in their candidate.

When I was going through this in 2008, I felt crazy. Like, Oh my God. You're not even allowed to say it's important to you that she's a woman, and we have literally our entire American history with no women in executive power?

It's certainly not the foremost reason that anybody I knew supported her, but of course it played into lots of people's excitement about her, right? But you couldn't say it. It was considered a dumb thing to say. It was considered a super feminized thing to say. You were thinking with your ovaries. It's just because you were a girl, blah blah blah.

And I remember thinking, Since when is it progressively OK that a country that's 51 percent female has only been governed by men? And that more than 80 percent of Congress is male? Why is it OK to not care about that?

And then by the time I published my book in 2010, everyone was like, ""Oh, yes, that's very true. We did do that."" There's a distance.

And now we're back in it and again it's like  you might as well just like put giant ovaries in your eyes with hearts if you're going to say, ""It matters to me.""

Many of the people who are critical of Clinton but who are feminist and who are progressive, one of the things they say is, ""It's important to me to have a female president, but it's not the overriding concern for me, and it's not going to drive my vote.""

That's a really fair thing to say.

It then gets transmitted very often  and especially if the person who has a really legitimate beef with Clinton, is very angry, or has also been made to feel like they are somehow betraying their sex if they're a woman or that they're not a real feminist  then it gets transmitted and amplified into ""I'm not going to do this stupid thing of voting with my vagina.""

So part of it I think it comes from well-intentioned progressives.

And in part it's just a larger cultural message. If there weren't a lot of cultural and social resistance to having a woman president, we probably would have had one in the past 225 years. The resistance to this comes in many forms and from many directions.

And I'm not saying that to oppose Clinton is a sexist move. I'm not equating opposition to Hillary Clinton with sexism.

However, there are some people whose opposition to Clinton  on totally valid and legitimate grounds  some people reach for kind of dismissive or misogynist language to convey their distaste for her.

Are you supporting any particular candidate at this point?

No. I'm not shy about it: I do a lot of defense of Clinton. But my job is to put her candidacy in a gendered and historical context, which means I'm often left doing the work of doing feminist defense for her.

I like [Clinton and Sanders] both. There are scenarios in which I could see myself voting for either one of them.

i toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR

Editor's note: Last fall, NPR's Maanvi Singh embarked on a months-long quest to find her ideal pumpkin pie recipe. As she discovered, there's a lot of science involved in getting the crust and filling just the way you like it. To celebrate Pi Day, we reprise this story, first published last December.

It was the best of pies, it was the worst of pies. I have baked many, many, many pies.

And when I first began making pumpkin pies this autumn, my results were at best inconsistent and, at worst, disastrous.

""One of the problems is most people make it once, maybe twice a year, right around the holidays, so they're not very practiced at it,"" says Dan Souza at America's Test Kitchen. ""And pumpkin pie is a little bit different in that it's essentially a custard baked into a pie shell."" In trying to juggle both components, even experienced bakers may end up with a grainy, overcooked filling or a soggy crust, Souza says. ""There's a lot of places you can slip up.""

So Souza and J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, a chef and author of The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science, coached me through the process.

The Ultimate Custard

""Mainly it's the texture that can go very wrong,"" Lopez-Alt says. ""It can end up grainy, or kind of broken up like scrambled eggs.""

Blergh.

See, a classic pumpkin pie filling includes a few eggs, as well as pumpkin puree, some cream, sugar and spice.

""As the custard cooks, there's a loose network of the egg proteins that intertwine with each other and set to give the filling structure,"" Lopez-Alt explains. Ideally, you want to cook the custard just enough to form a soft, gel-like texture. ""But as the custard keeps cooking, the eggs start to set so tightly that they squeeze moisture out,"" he says. That's when you get an icky, lumpy pie.

Both Lopez-Alt and Souza recommend cooking the filling quickly, but gently: The center of the pie should never get any hotter than about 175 degrees Fahrenheit.

i toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR

And you've got to try to cook the pie as evenly as possible. Some cracking at the center of the pie is inevitable, Lopez-Alt says. It happens because the edges of the pie tend to cook and set faster, and pull at the center, which takes longer to cook.

Souza's pro tip is to bake the pie at about 400 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes, until the filling just starts to set, and then lower the oven temperature to about 300 degrees until it cooks through. ""By lowering the overall temperature, you get less of a disparity between temperature at the perimeter of the pie, and the temperature at the center,"" he says. He also recommends heating the filling on the stove for a bit, so it has to spend even less time cooking unevenly inside the oven.

Oh, and padding the custard with lots of fat helps as well. Souza's recipe calls for three eggs plus two egg yolks. ""By ditching some of the egg whites, you're reducing some of the water content, so the filling takes less time to firm up,"" he explains. ""And the fat in the egg yolks also serves as a buffer to keep the proteins from over cooking.""

Lopez-Alt suggests substituting the cream in the filling with cream cheese for a similar reason: It helps the custard cook more evenly for a smooth, creamy end result.

Brilliant.

The Ideal Crust

Over the past few months, I tried nearly everything to avoid ending up with soggy, mushy pie crusts. I pre-baked and crisped up my crusts before pouring in the filling. I tried brushing the bottom of my crust with some egg wash  to waterproof it. I pleaded with the culinary gods and complained to my friends and cried to my mother.

All of this, to no avail.

i toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR

And then Lopez-Alt suggested something wacky and wonderful: vodka. Not to drink (though a shot or two have served to console me after a culinary disaster). Lopez-Alt suggests substituting some of the water used to pull the pie dough together with a tablespoon or two of vodka. ""When you mix flour with water, it produces gluten,"" he explains. ""And gluten is what makes your pie dough tough rather than flaky.""

But gluten doesn't form in the presence of alcohol. ""Plus the vodka evaporates a bit more quickly when you bake the crust, so you're less likely to end up with a soggy crust,"" Lopez-Alt says.

He also suggests blending flour and butter together in the food processor. ""That way you need to add barely any water at the end to bring the dough together,"" he says. ""But the dough is still very soft, and easy to roll out.""

Pre-bake the crust until it's golden brown, and then, Souza says, fill it with a custard that you've already heated and thickened up a bit on the stove. ""That way,"" he says, ""the filling is less likely to seep and soak through the crust, and ruin that buttery, flaky goodness.""

The Richest Flavors

Canned or fresh squash?

The experts agree it doesn't really matter.

If you are using the fresh stuff, Lopez-Alt recommends roasting it very slowly in the oven  at around 275 degrees Fahrenheit. ""Pumpkins and squashes have these enzymes that will break down some of their starches and convert them to sugar,"" he says. ""Cooking them slowly can actually accelerate that process."" Slow-roasting also allows for more water to evaporate from the squash, concentrating its flavor.

And feel free to experiment with different squashes. Sugar pie pumpkins are classic, but butternut and kabocha squash can often taste sweeter and more ""pumpkin-y"" than the traditional orange gourds. ""Just never use one of those Jack-O-Lantern pumpkins,"" Lopez-Alt warns. ""Those are meant to look pretty, but they taste nasty.""

But Souza says people can rarely taste the difference: ""I think you may as well save yourself the effort and use a can.""

Of course, a judicious sprinkle of spices, some maple syrup and even a bit of sweet potato can deepen and enhance the flavor.

The Taste Tests

My journey to learn the art and science of the ideal pie has been long. Very, very long. I've baked a total of 10 pies over the past three months. I wanted to perfect my pie by Thanksgiving  but that didn't happen. Instead, I berated my Thanksgiving guests: ""You're saying it's good, but what does that even mean? Be more constructive with your criticism!""

i toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR

I faced many setbacks: I badly burned a couple of crusts. And, despite all the coaching, I curdled some custard. Take note, folks: Timers and thermometers are key.

But finally, in mid-December, I brought in two pies that combined all that I had learned to face my toughest critics yet: NPR's Science Desk.

For one pie, I used freshly roasted squash and cream cheese. I made the other with canned pumpkin. One of the crusts had some shortening, whereas the other was pure butter. And I used a good shot of vodka in both, of course.

Each pie had its fans.

My editor, Maria Godoy*, liked the cream cheese. ""It's like creamy pumpkin... Like, if pumpkin were milk.""

NPR Skunk Bear's Adam Cole disagreed: ""Not my cup of tea."" He liked the canned pumpkin better. [*Editor's note: Adam has an admitted preference for bland food.]

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday he has ordered the withdrawal of the majority of Russian troops from Syria. The pullout, which he said was coordinated with Syrian President Bashar Assad, is slated to begin Tuesday.

Speaking in a meeting with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, Putin said the objective of Russia's intervention  disrupting ISIS and other terror groups  had ""been fulfilled,"" and had laid the groundwork for more intense peace talks.

""I believe that the task put before the defence ministry and Russian armed forces has, on the whole, been fulfilled,"" Putin said, according to the Guardian. ""With the participation of the Russian military ... the Syrian armed forces and patriotic Syrian forces have been able to achieve a fundamental turnaround in the fight against international terrorism and have taken the initiative in almost all respects.""

Russia has long been a supporter of Assad's regime. Critics of Russia's presence in the country say Russian troops were involved in fighting the Syrian opposition groups, not just terrorists.

Putin said that Russia's Hmeimim air base and its Mediterranean naval base would continue to operate normally.

President Obama spoke to Putin on Monday afternoon, the White House said in a statement. They discussed Putin's announcement and the ""next steps required to fully implement the cessation of hostilities with the goal of advancing the political negotiations on resolution of the conflict.""

The statement said Obama ""welcomed the much-needed reduction in violence since the beginning of the cessation, but stressed that continuing offensive actions by Syrian regime forces risk undermining"" the peace process.

Other U.S. officials are tempering their reactions to the announcement, according to Reuters, saying they had seen no indications so far of preparations by Russia's military for the withdrawal.

Putin's announcement comes as a Russian and U.S.-brokered cease-fire that began last month has largely held, though the Syrian government and the opposition have each cited violations by the other side. ISIS and the al-Qaida branch operating in Syria are not part of the cease-fire agreement.

The withdrawal also comes amid peace talks in Geneva aimed at resolving the 5-year-old Syrian conflict.

Putin said Monday's move would send a ""good signal"" to the parties to the conflict, help raise trust and help serve as a stimulus for Syria's political talks, the Associated Press reports.

The talks are expected to focus on a political transition in Syria, which has been a major sticking point for the various parties. Russia and the Syrian regime have been adamant about keeping Assad in power, while the U.S. and Syrian opposition groups demand a new government.",[]

i toggle caption John Sommers II/Getty Images John Sommers II/Getty Images

There remains a chance  or at least a hope  that the violent storm blowing in over American politics this primary season will move on without further damage to the country.

More specifically, there is a chance  or at least a hope  that the violence witnessed at recent rallies for Donald Trump will subside. And that those most inclined to physical confrontation might step back from the brink.

But the videos of violent scuffles at the aborted Trump rally in Chicago on Friday continue to play on cable TV, keeping the wound fresh.

There is nothing new about Americans being politically divided and even polarized. But as angry emotions have been building throughout the campaign, we are moving to the next phase, to the point where even small provocations can cause those emotions to ignite.

If you are looking to light the fuse, consider this tweet from @realDonaldTrump on Sunday, directed at Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, whom Trump blames, in part, for the bad night in Chicago:

Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2016

There is no evidence that Sanders or his campaign were involved in organizing the protest in Chicago, although some independent organizations that support Sanders clearly were. Sanders T-shirts were visible among the protesters but were scarcely predominant.

But Trump's threat communicates an unmistakable message, not to Sanders but to Trump's own supporters. This is less like a ""dog whistle"" and more like a bugle call, much like the instructions Trump has sometimes given his supporters at rallies.

As protesters have been led away by police or security, Trump has said he wishes he could punch them in the face, or that in the old days protesters went out on a stretcher, or that someone should ""knock the crap out of them"" and that he would pay legal fees for someone who did.

On Sunday, Trump told Chuck Todd on NBC's Meet the Press (where Trump is a guest on a regular basis) that he ""actually instructed my people to look into"" paying the legal fees for the North Carolina man who punched a black protester being led away by police at a Trump rally on Thursday.

""I'm going to see, you know, what was behind this,"" Trump said, ""because he was very taunting; he was very loud, very disruptive.""

Trump also said he had heard the protester had made an obscene gesture toward a man ""who just wants America to be great again.""

It is not too late to dial back from this kind of incitement. The best way to do so would be for all of the candidates in both parties to stop looking for ways to use the violence issue to their advantage and find ways to reduce the tension instead.

That was not the spirit in evidence over the weekend, as the respective camps issued statements blaming each other and advancing their own narratives.

Trump on Sunday also called himself a messenger for ""a lot of people who are angry."" Sanders, too, has consistently appealed to the frustration of those who feel themselves disenfranchised in a ""rigged economy"" run by what he calls fraudulent financiers and a corrupt campaign-finance system.

This is not to deny these movements their cause, only to say that their emotional component can be easily inflamed and the shared sense of outrage can be readily provoked.

It is as if the Tea Party of recent years had marched down the street and met another march coming at it head-on, featuring Occupy Wall Street bolstered by Black Lives Matter.

Different as they are, all of these groups would be taking to the street for the same reason: to protest their sense of loss and their exasperation with conventional politics and candidates.

Even Barack Obama, who seemed to many the ultimate game changer eight years ago, now seems to have unified the country only in that he has dissatisfied a sizable group on the left as much as he has outraged the right. And he has had no success convincing a certain strain of activist in his own party that they should be patient, or should see the glass as half-full.

Trump and Sanders, in their highly contrasting ways, have thrived on this frustration and exasperation.

Hillary Clinton, for all her adaptations, has been unable to find the key or even speak the language. And a long roster of Republicans have retired from the field who had hoped to use the anger of the Tea Party as fuel  and the anger of activists on the left as foil.

Those GOP rivals who remain spent much of the weekend seeking ways to leverage the sudden media fixation on violence to maximize their own vote shares in the five big states holding primaries Tuesday.

That was why, in part, Trump exploded on CNN when asked about disapproval from ""fellow Republicans.""

""My fellow Republicans are running against me,"" he said, claiming, ""There's been nobody injured at my rallies: zero, zero. You're making it sound like everybody's broken down and injured. Give me a break.""

As for those primaries Tuesday, the consensus judgment, based on polling and reporting, is that the confrontations last week in North Carolina, St. Louis and Chicago will alienate some potential supporters but also galvanize those at the heart of the Trump movement.

If true, that will extend a trend that has been evident in the Trump phenomenon since the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9. His hard base of backers rarely changes, typically ranging from the mid-30s to low-40s in percentage terms. In a multi-candidate field, this has usually been more than enough to win  and often to win big.

If the field should narrow to just two candidates, however, Trump's share of the vote might not be enough to win one-on-one, as some hypothetical match-ups indicate. That could block his nomination on the first ballot and break open the convention in Cleveland.

And in the longer run, as other polling also indicates, the harder his base, the harder it is for him to reach beyond it in the general election.

In that sense, the combative attitude that contributes to the tension of the current moment can actually lower the ceiling on Trump's upside expectations  and lower the odds on his becoming president as well.

Trump risks driving his negatives (voters who say they could never vote for him) still higher at a time when they are already the highest of any candidate in either party.

That is why in the end, the climate of heightened tension may prove more hazardous to Trump perhaps than to anyone else.",[]

Claire O'Neill/NPR

Mathematician Carlos Castillo-Chavez says that pi is so important to math that using its simple, geometric definition denies its greater powers.

""[Pi] brings you into the world of mathematics, which is magic, mysterious and exciting and always full of challenges for everybody,"" Castillo-Chavez said.

First calculated 4,000 years ago, pi represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. You learned it as 3.14, which is why today some take the chance to bask in the brilliance and beauty of the mathematical constant, while others try to tear it down.

Castillo-Chavez is firmly in the pro-pi camp. He studies epidemics at Arizona State University, and he says pi is used to study everything that cycles  waves and heart pulses and anything that recurs.

In his own work, Castillo-Chavez uses pi to try to understand why certain strains of influenza seem to reappear every 20 years. In math, he says, pi pops up in the most unexpected places.

""Pi, with its infinite number of digits, is an introduction to the kinds of mathematics that we do, which often involve the study of infinite processes,"" Castillo-Chavez said.

What's more, Castillo-Chavez says that pi is most people's introduction to a mind-blowing concept invented by Georg Cantor that says there is a hierarchy of infinities. In simple terms, the infinity in between numbers is larger than the infinity of, say, countable numbers. Pi, whose decimals extend into infinity, opens up that parable, says Castillo-Chavez.

YouTube star Vi Hart, who calls herself a recreational mathematician, is not impressed with pi. She's made it a habit of posting anti-pi videos on Pi Day.

YouTube

""Pi is not special,"" she says in one. ""Yeah, pie can be fun and I'd never deny you your desserts, but maybe try some real food every once in a while.""

Her beef? She says there are plenty of other mathematical constants that are just as beautiful and just as infinite as pi.

Also, pi doesn't make sense, she says. The equation for the circumference of a circle is 2r. Wouldn't it be simpler, she says, if we created a new constant that makes equations easier?

Hart has jumped on the tau movement, which says that  should really be 2 and be called tau. In other words, instead of the angles of a full circle being equal to 2, they would be equal to T.

""Every mathematician should care about the simplicity and beauty of the constants we choose,"" Hart said. ""But students find it confusing when they're dealing with radians and they find radians to be so unnatural because we use pi radians. Whereas if we used tau radians, students suddenly find it very easy to say, 'Well, half a tau is halfway around a circle, 180 degrees. A quarter tau is a quarter of the way around the circle.' It's obvious. It's simple. If we're dealing with radians, we should be using tau, and that makes all the math much easier for everyone, not just students.""

YouTube

But I remind Vi Hart that her name rhymes with pi, and that makes me question the sincerity of her opposition.

""Some people might think there's a conspiracy there, that all along I've only been pretending to hate pi, but really I'm just trying to rally people behind the cause of pi through manufactured outrage,"" she said, adding that it's only a theory.

It's also worth noting, however, that Hart also collaborated with math artist John Sims on a song they call the ""Pi Day Anthem.""

Hordes of twenty-somethings living in their parents' house dream of becoming rap superstars. What sets Brandon Perry, aka K.A.A.N., apart: he's really good. Jezebel's Jia Tolentino has described the Maryland rapper's ""technical virtuosity,"" likening Perry to Kendrick Lamar and calling his best moments ""so directly vulnerable and commanding that they feel channeled.""

In the 10 months since, Perry has only gotten crisper. If you don't believe me, check out this clip from ""Rap God rmx,"" his take on the Eminem original:

Clip from K.A.A.N.'s ""Rap God rmx"" Loading... 0:20 Clip from K.A.A.N.'s ""Rap God rmx""

Did you catch that? Neither did I, the first fifty times I listened, but that's just fine. It's one of those magical stretches that combines everything that makes good rap so fun to listen to: rhythm and rhyme, wordplay and style, storytelling and signifying, to borrow criteria from Adam Bradley's ""Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop.""

Perry's lyrics get serious, taking up issues like mental health, politics, history, and religion, but he's also a master of super goofy, intensely satisfying posturing. Try not to smile as you watch the video for ""Kaancepts,"" where he bops around in a Georgetown jersey spewing a series of math puns that culminate in ""I haven't even touched on the square roots of my averages, the 3.14 pi divided with savages."" Musically, he plays with a range of styles, rapping over Mozart's Lacrymosa in ""Work"" and sampling ""Hotel California"" in ""The Eagles.""

""If y equals mx plus me, then I must be an MC that's obscene!"" YouTube

His website talks about hip hop being a voice for the voiceless, so I asked Perry who he's trying to represent. ""There are a sect of kids that are not feeling trap rap and they're not feeling drinking cough syrup and getting high, popping a Xan and getting high,"" he says. ""I feel like there's a lot of introspective, artistic kids...So I kind of want to speak to those kids that have talents and abilities, [but] they're just too insecure and too self-conscious to actually act on those things.""

Take ""Antidope,"" a song about reinventing oneself. It's Perry's twist on Travis Scott's blow-up single ""Antidote."" Compare the opening lyrics of the original (""Don't you open up that window/Don't you let out that antidote/Poppin' pills is all we know/In the hills is all we know,"") to Perry's version: ""Lately I haven't been sleeping. I'm terrified that I'm falling off. I've been secluded, ashamed that I lost it. Forgiving myself is a daunting task. Now I'm revising the vision. Slow down the rhythm, it's easy to listen.""

I asked Perry what role racial identity plays in his music. ""I'm obviously a younger black man,"" he says, ""so that stuff is definitely in the back of my mind....All that stuff we're seeing nowadays with police brutality and racism and bigotry that we've always seen in this country, it's always in the back of your mind...I feel like if you're born black it's kind of like it comes with the territory. You've gotta know what's going on around you and what situations you're in. But in terms of me writing, I don't feel like I speak for anyone. I don't speak for young black men or black people. I speak for myself.""

In ""Real,"" Perry reflects about how some of those instances of racism and brutality affect his own mentality, as well as how he sees members of his community responding. He wraps up the last verse with this kicker: ""You act like this brutality has not happened for ages. There ain't no turning of pages, instead I'm setting the scene. Out in Texas they'll f murder you for traffic infractions, violating your civil liberties and all of your rights. If you don't understand the law then you could call it a night. Getting harassed and on your ass and then they taking your life. But this reality is feeling very nightmare-like. I said it's all the same thing from Sandra to Rodney King.""

Over the past month, millions of YouTube viewers have watched what happens when a U.S. manufacturer announces a move to Mexico.

Click on the unsteady cellphone video, shot at a factory that makes air conditioning, heating and related equipment in Indianapolis, and you will see workers listening to a man in a suit.

He's telling them that their paychecks are headed to Mexico.

""I want to be clear, this is strictly a business decision,"" the man says.

An agonized, collective cry goes up. People swear, shout and look away.

Turns out, moving manufacturing jobs to Monterrey, Mexico, is more than strictly business. It's also very personal, painful  and political.

The Feb. 9 announcement was made by Carrier Corp., which says it will close both the Indianapolis plant, with 1,400 workers, and another nearby facility with 700 workers.

It's a decision that has been made again and again in recent decades as manufacturers have shifted production to offshore facilities.

But this Carrier move is playing out in the middle of a combative presidential primary season  and the amateur video is having an impact on candidates and voters.

GOP front-runner Donald Trump is using it as a key talking point.

""I'm going to tell the head of Carrier: 'I hope you enjoy your stay in Mexico folks. But every single unit that you make and send across our border, which now will be real, you're going to pay a 35 percent tax,' "" Trump said at a campaign stop in Dayton, Ohio, on Saturday.

On his Facebook page, Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has said the Carrier move ""is another example of how NAFTA and other trade policies have been a disaster for American workers.""

Both Trump and Sanders have been attracting voters by saying American workers are suffering because manufacturers have been chasing cheaper labor.

And Carrier's parent company, Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp., agrees that lowering costs is indeed the motivation. But the point is not to hurt workers; rather, it is to keep a strong, U.S.-based corporation succeeding in a global marketplace.

Last week, United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes talked to investors and explained the company's thinking.

""The fact is, what will drive world class margins, why margins at our climate control and security business are so good, is because we have been relentless in taking out costs,"" he said.

Hayes says trade barriers, such as Trump's 35 percent tax, ultimately would hurt his company's workers. That's because United Technologies brings in fewer products than it exports, such as jet engines and elevators.

Mark Perry, an economist for the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says the idea of taxing companies for offshoring work goes back to an economic theory known as mercantilism. The theory dominated economic thinking in Europe from the 16th to 18th centuries, when governments tried to boost their wealth by imposing tariffs on foreign goods.

The United States tried this approach with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which pushed tariffs to record levels. Most economists say it backfired.

""Our trading partners ended up imposing tariffs and taxes on American goods and so it really reduced, significantly, global trade to a point that then some people even say that that's what made the Great Depression great,"" Perry said.

Scott Lincicome, a trade expert with the Libertarian Cato Institute, says that when weighing the impact of the Carrier move to Mexico, one needs to remember the interests of consumers.

Heat is one of the biggest causes of weather-related deaths, so cheap air conditioning is vital, the argument goes. If costs can't be held down, then consumers will ""either pay more or be totally priced out of the market and thus forced to simply suffer through another brutal August,"" Lincicome argues.

These disputes over the interests of workers versus consumers will continue to play out this year on the campaign trail as well as in Congress. This year, lawmakers will be asked by the White House to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed Pacific Rim trade deal involving the United States.

It is supported by President Obama and Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. On NPR's Morning Edition in June, Ryan said he supports trade deals that level the playing field.

""They treat us like we treat them, they open our markets reciprocally to ours, to our exports. And they raise their standards to our standards,"" Ryan said.

But the TPP is unlikely to pass in Congress before the election as popular sentiment turns against it.

And as the presidential candidates scramble for voters, Trump, Sanders and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton are all pumping up that sentiment.

Last week, Sanders tweeted: ""If elected, I won't send the TPP to Congress and will continue to fight efforts to pass it. I urge @HillaryClinton to join me.""

On Sunday, at the Ohio Democratic Party's Legacy Dinner, Clinton said that as president, she would ""stop, dead in its tracks, any trade deal that hurts America and American workers. ... So that's why I've said we have to oppose the TPP.""

On Monday, Trump tweeted about his opponent Ohio Gov. John Kasich and the North American Free Trade Agreement: ""Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA, which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers!""

Kasich, as well as GOP candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, generally have been supportive of trade deals.

For the past two weekends, the biggest movie in America has been an ambitious exploration of implicit bias set in a police department, an unmissable sign of how broadly saturated this conversation has become. Of course, the characters grappling with all this in Zootopia are talking rabbits and foxes and lions, making all this topicality easier to swallow.

There are a bunch of ways in which Zootopia is surprisingly sharp, but the places it stumbles are the same places where lots of well-intentioned movies about race and society miss the mark. It's difficult to grapple with big, systemic issues in any film, let alone one carried by woodland creatures and aimed at 9-year-olds.

But first, Zootopia's premise. A likable bunny named Judy Hopps leaves her rural community to pursue dreams of becoming a police officer in the big city. She wants to make a difference. Along the way, she learns to navigate complicated interspecies urban politics  and confront her own biases.

Zootopia, the movie's eponymous metropolis, is populated by predators and prey of all different kinds who live in relative harmony; about 90 percent of the population are prey, and 10 percent are predators. The movie is full of fun ""Let's Talk About Race"" Easter eggs. Judy thinks she's complimenting a fox by telling him he's ""articulate."" The fox is later reprimanded for touching the wool on a sheep's head without permission. When a fellow cop, a cheetah, tells Hopps she's ""cute,"" she gently corrects him  only other bunnies get to use that word.

In her first days on the new job, Hopps quickly runs into systemic problems in police departments that mirror the real world. She's the first rabbit officer in the history of Zootopia's police force  she was valedictorian of her class at the academy  which the assistant mayor counts as a win for the department's ""mammal outreach"" program. But the police brass, largely staffed by burly predators, isn't feeling the relatively tiny Hopps.

They dismiss her hire as a feel-good publicity stunt and promptly relegate her to meter maid work with the thankless task of handing out 100 parking tickets by day's end. Because she's so ambitious, Hopps gives herself an even loftier goal: 200 tickets, by noon. (More on that in a second.)

Through sheer determination and the sweat off her furry brow, Hopps makes it her mission to convince Zootopia's big dogs that creatures who look like her belong just as much as they do. (There's also another storyline involving a racial-profiling panic inadvertently set off by Hopps, in which the predators are suddenly the ones under the microscope; that arc, depressingly, could play as an allegory to any number of contemporary racial panics in America right now.)

Films about big social issues tend, almost by necessity, to follow along as one heroic individual makes choices that change the world. This tack often places Big, Thorny Issues on the shoulders of people who happen to be good or malicious, and suggest that promoting  or removing  those individuals will untie whatever big, hoary knot is strangling society at large.

That is to say, the elements you need to tell a great story hardly ever play well with the structural unpacking involved in real-life social change. That's why it's awfully easy for ""message"" films to end up wildly mischaracterizing Big Thorny Issues to the point that the takeaway becomes irrelevant  if not outright damaging  to ongoing real-life discussions about the issue in question.

YouTube

A good (awful) recent example is Spike Lee's messy Chi-Raq, a parable about gun violence in Chicago in which a woman upends the cycle of shootings through a sanctimonious, person-by-person campaign of choosing to abstain from sex. At some point, the ""just be better people"" treatment is too simplistic for the topic on the table.

In Zootopia, we follow along as our hero, Hopps, hands out hundreds of tickets to overcome workplace discrimination and prove that someone who looks like her can be a valuable member of the force. We're meant to cheer along as she rolls up her sleeves and really leans into it.

But this is not some neutral, benign practice in real life. As my colleague Joe Shapiro has reported, the festering tensions between police and residents that exploded in Ferguson rested upon a long history of aggressive, racially skewed ticketing and fines as a widely used mechanism for generating city revenue. And it has been pointed out that the practices of ticketing and stopping pedestrians and drivers for minor violations are often used by law enforcement as pretext for more expansive searches.

At this very moment, there's a closely watched lawsuit in the works brought by several black NYPD officers who claim that monthly ticketing quotas still exist in that city  where it's technically illegal  and that those quotas are enforced most heavily in neighborhoods of color. (There's a fantastic, disturbing This American Life episode about an NYPD officer who tried to speak out against these mandates from his superiors, and what happened to him when he did.)

In its zeal to show how a scrappy pint-sized hero subverts the system through sheer force of will, Zootopia misses the real-world implications of how she chooses to succeed in that mission. Ultimately, Hopps ends up doing exactly what any real-world cop trying to rise in the ranks might do  she plays by the rules. As Tracie Keesee, a former captain in the Denver police force and one of the leaders of the Center for Policing Equity, told me, officers, regardless of race, are likely to become acculturated to the ethos and systems of their departments. Any cop invested in trying to change the system from within first has to move up the ladder and secure a position of power from which to do so  and the surest way to get there is by excelling at the game in its existing form.

To wit, Hopps' reward for cracking the big case at the end: more prestige in her police department, as evidenced by her impressive new ride  which looks a whole lot like an MRAP.

I know, I know  this reads a lot like come over here and get you some of this wet blanket. And to be sure, Zootopia is welcome evidence that the conversation about policing and profiling has outgrown spaces we tend to see as expressly political. Clearly, marketers have identified a mass-market appetite for this stuff across huge swaths of America. But as this big-budget, name-brand exploration demonstrates, the most pernicious manifestations of these issues remain difficult to dramatize (or animate). When it comes to storytelling, they defy the very elements you need to make a movie like Zootopia work.",[]

JACOBS: (As Mickey) Yeah, do it. Go get him, tiger.

RUST: (As Gus) Oh, my God, this feels - ""Sweet Home Alabama."" Lies. ""What Women Want?"" Lies. ""When Harry Met Sally."" Lies. ""Homeland,"" season three?

JACOBS: (As Mickey) Very confusing.

RUST: (As Gus) Yeah, like she could ever just sneak into Iran. That's like - all these Blu-rays have been weighing me down. Get it out of my life.

ANN MARIE BALDONADO, BYLINE: Gillian Jacobs and Paul Rust, welcome to FRESH AIR.

JACOBS: Thank you.

RUST: Thank you for having us.

BALDONADO: Now, in that scene, both characters are blaming what they've seen in pop culture for their bad luck in relationships. What kind of pop culture did you both watch when you were growing up that you feel influenced, at least early on, what you thought about adult relationships and love?

JACOBS: I watched a lot of Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant movies so maybe I was anticipating more witty banter than I've actually experienced in real life.

RUST: For me, early on I guess I watched just a lot of bad TV. You know, I would love to be able to say Cary Grant, but it was probably more like Tony Danza.

(LAUGHTER)

BALDONADO: Now, you really slow this story down - the two characters meeting and becoming involved in each other's lives. Judd Apatow, who's one of the executive producers on the show, has said it took five episodes to do what usually happened in the first five minutes of a pilot because you all found the details of that really fascinating. What is it that you wanted to make time for? What do you get by spreading it out over those 10 episodes?

RUST: Yeah, I think us knowing also that we sort of had these two seasons and 22 episodes ahead of us meant we had the luxury to slow it down. And, you know, I think maybe what was gained by that was sort of our feeling that usually when two people start a relationship, it's rarely easy, and a lot of times either somebody's still hung up about an ex or there's stuff going on at work that just makes it more difficult to be open and available to starting a relationship with somebody.

And it was just really exciting to see how patient we could be and to see how, oh, you could do an entire episode just about the agony of sending out a text at 9 a.m. and not hearing back from it until 8 p.m. (Laughter). So a lot of those sort of, like, missed connections and fumbling towards five seconds of happiness I think was appealing to us.

BALDONADO: Gus and Mickey go out on 10 of their first official date, and Gus takes Mickey to - I'm sorry, what is it? The Magic...

JACOBS: Castle.

RUST: The Magic Castle.

JACOBS: (Laughter).

BALDONADO: So it comes out that Gus is very interested in magic and Mickey is not. And that gets at something that I think is interesting about this show. Often people in college or in their 20s, they kind of use sensibility or the things that you're interested in - whether it's movies or music - as a way to sort of find partners. And I think one thing that happens with Mickey and Gus is they're kind of in different social spheres and they kind of think different things are interesting. So in this example, Gus is into magic and Mickey isn't.

JACOBS: Yeah, I think that in high school and college and in your early 20s, you really look to those signposts of taste as things that make a good match. And I've - certainly, for my own life -come to value much different things in people as I've gotten older and what makes them a good partner or a good friend.

RUST: Yeah, and I remember a couple of years ago talking with a friend, and he was saying, you know, he didn't know if this woman he was seeing was right for him because they didn't like the same things. And I remember saying, like, what are you, in the 7th grade?

(LAUGHTER)

RUST: Like, it does seem like a weird reason to - I mean, certainly, shared sensibilities are nice, but, you know, somebody doesn't have to like ""Three Amigos,"" (laughter), in order for me to like them. I mean, helps but...

BALDONADO: Now, Gus - Paul's character - works as an onset teacher for an hour-long drama about witches. It's called ""Witchita."" But he's an aspiring writer, too, and we actually get to see the inside of a writers' room, which to me is something very fascinating, the TV writers' room.

Now, you, Paul, have worked on TV shows like ""Comedy Bang Bang,"" ""Human Giant,"" even the Netflix season of ""Arrested Development."" Your wife, Lesley Arfin, wrote for ""Girls,"" ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"" and, I'm not sure if any of you wrote for shows like ""Witchita,"" or, one-hour shows, but why did you want to feature that kind of writers' room as opposed to maybe a more comedy one?

RUST: I think because - yeah, none of us have worked in a drama writers' room. It sort of fascinated us to put it there. And maybe also there's something funny about seeing people care so deeply about an hour-long supernatural drama. That was funny to us. I mean, I always was curious what a writers' room is like for a drama because when you're in a writers' room for a comedy, you can make a joke and everybody laughs. And if everybody laughs, you know, oh, it's effective.

And I always wondered, like, what are writers' room for dramas like? Somebody's like, and then the son comes in and tells his dad he loves him. And then everybody in the room, their eyes fill up with tears. They're like, yeah, yeah, that's good. And then what if - what if the dad tells the son he loves him too? Then you just have a room of crying people (laughter), and then you know it's working. So yeah, and I think also we were already doing enough navel-gazing, you know, to have to make it a comedy writers' room, either. We can try to move it just two notches away and make it a supernatural drama.

GROSS: We're listening to the interview FRESH AIR producer Ann Marie Baldonado recorded with Paul Rust and Gillian Jacobs, who star in the new Netflix comedy series ""Love."" There's more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR producer Anne Marie Baldonado recorded with Gillian Jacobs and Paul Rust, the stars of the new Netflix comedy series ""Love.""

BALDONADO: Now, Gillian, you started acting when you were a kid. Can you describe how you first got interested in it?

JACOBS: The school called my mother and told her that I didn't have any friends, and I was talking to myself on the playground during recess and suggested that she get me into an extra-curricular activity. And she said that I was a very overly dramatic child, and she thought I would enjoy acting. So she signed me up for my first acting class. And I just instantly fell in love with it. And from there on out tried to take as many classes and be in as many plays as I could in Pittsburgh, where I grew up.

BALDONADO: You wrote this wonderful piece for Lenny, which is the newsletter that's edited by Lena Dunham about growing up and getting into acting and then going to college for acting at Juilliard. You received there at Juilliard a classical training. And I was wondering if you could talk a little about that. What is classical training for acting? You use words like movement work and neutral mask work. Can you talk a little bit about that?

JACOBS: Sure, yes. At Juilliard, there's a heavy emphasis on classical theater. So we would do one Shakespeare play a year, a lot of classical theater. And also, there was a heavy, heavy emphasis on voice and speech work, things like movement classes, neutral mask work, yes, also character mask work, I have to add, took, like, a classical clowning program. (Laughter). It's a very...

BALDONADO: What is neutral mask work?

JACOBS: Everyone is given this mask that has the same blank expression on it. You do various movement exercises trying to communicate different things, but you don't have the benefit of having any kind of facial expressions. So it's really about, like, learning how to communicate through your whole body. There's a lot of that.

And then, you know, once you've graduated from neutral mask work, you're given a character mask which has an exaggerated expression or exaggerated facial features. And then you're supposed to let that inform a character and sort of build off of that. You know, you do things like go to the zoo and observe animals and then go into your acting class and act out scenes as those animals. I spent a lot of time pretending to drink imaginary beverages, all sorts of things.

BALDONADO: In that Lenny piece, you talk about how you had a hard time at Juilliard. And at one point, you tried to do a comedy piece. And you felt like it was the first time you got a good reaction from students, but you got completely discouraged by a teacher. What was the comedy piece and what was the reaction to it?

JACOBS: I think it was from a play by Christopher Durang. This was the first time that I got a really enthusiastic response from my classmates. They were really laughing. And, like, it was the first time they really seemed to respond to something that I had done, which was exciting for me. And then the teacher said well, you can clearly do that so never bring in a piece like that again. And it made me feel like being funny was unimportant or less important and that it wasn't valuable. And it wasn't really until, you know, years later out of college that I started to learn that that was important and it was a skill that I possessed and that it was something worth exploring.

BALDONADO: So many people know you from your role as Britta from ""Community."" I just wanted to play a short scene to remind us all of the series. This is from the third season. It's just a quick scene from the room where the study group meets. The group has just found out that Shirley is getting remarried to her ex-husband, and the rest of the group is skeptical.

(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, ""COMMUNITY"")

DANNY PUDI: (As Abed Nadir) It's cool that Shirley are getting married again. There's a whole generation of viewers that didn't get to see the original.

DONALD GLOVER: (As Troy Barnes) Let's hope it's more of a Bale than a Kilmer situation.

CHEVY CHASE: (As Pierce Hawthorne) Second weddings are OK, I guess. If I had to rank them, I'd go fourth, seventh, second, fifth, first, third, sixth. No wait, first then fifth.

PUDI: (As Abed Nadir) Got it - fourth, seventh, second, first, fifth, third, sixth.

JACOBS: (As Britta Perry) When's our culture going to outgrow this wedding thing?

ALISON BRIE: (As Annie Edison) You're anti-wedding now?

JOEL MCHALE: (As Jeff Winger) No, she's just pro-anti.

JACOBS: (As Britta Perry) No to everything you both said. Weddings are like little girls tea parties except the women are the stuffed animals, the men are making them talk and they're not drinking tea, they're drinking antiquated gender roles.

MCHALE: (As Jeff Winger) Somebody tell Britta what an analogy is.

JACOBS: (As Britta Perry) I know what it is. It's, like, a thought with another thought's hat on.

BALDONADO: That's a scene from the third season of ""Community."" You've said that ""Community"" was like graduate school for you, that you had to unlearn some of your dramatic training. What are some examples of that?

JACOBS: There were very technical aspects about comedy that I really felt like I had to learn, like, you know, the timing of how you deliver a line makes or breaks if it's funny or not. I had a sense of that, but I didn't always feel like I had a mastery of it when I started. So I would sometimes get very nervous when I write a script and I felt like they'd given me something that I wasn't quite sure if I could pull it off, things like that. And then I sort of realized that I really enjoyed physical comedy, so making bolder choices in that way.

But, I learned so much from sitting around that table. You know, Donald Glover is one of the most naturally funny people I've ever met in my life. You know, Jim Rash, Ken Jeong, Joel - you know, I could go down everyone and list you things I've learned from them. But I really felt like the first couple of seasons, I was just sort of - I would read it in the script and then I'd watch how they delivered a line and what they did to make it funny and sort of try to apply that to myself.

BALDONADO: You're already moving forward with the second season of ""Love."" Did you always have an idea of where you wanted it to go over the two seasons? Did you already kind of have it mapped out?

RUST: I mean, I think we had it mapped out in very broad strokes. I think the thing we realized once we started writing the first season is just getting a lot of joy about seeing how patient we could be. And so anytime that we would start sort of accelerating the storytelling or the progress of Mickey and Gus's relationship, we would ask ourselves sort of can we go slower? You know, as Judd has said, the part of the romantic comedy that people most like is the falling for each other and the getting together. So we're just trying I think in a way that people do in real life and their own relationships try to relish and cherish the initial moments of connection.

And then yeah, as far as - when we brought Gillian in, you know, we did write the part for her in mind. And it was so exciting when Judd called up and said hey, I think Gillian's going to be available. And it was a dream come true getting to have Gillian 'cause I am such a fan of hers and the work she's done. But it was funny, when she came into the - it wasn't the first time we met, but it was definitely the first time you came to the writers' room to hang out with us.

JACOBS: Oh, God.

RUST: We had a very Gus and Mickey moment where she walked in the writers' room holding a coffee. And then I went in to hug her and I knocked the coffee out of her hand and it spilled everywhere on the floor.

(LAUGHTER)

RUST: And then we both turned out to the writers and like this is the show. This is it.

(LAUGHTER)

BALDONADO: Gillian Jacobs and Paul Rust, thank you so much.

JACOBS: Thank You.

RUST: Thank You.

GROSS: Gillian Jacobs and Paul Rust star in the series ""Love."" All 10 episodes of the first season can be found on Netflix. They're currently shooting season two. Paul Rust co-wrote the new Pee-wee Herman film that will premiere on Netflix this Friday. Gillian Jacobs stars in Mike Birbiglia's new movie don't think twice, which premiered at South by Southwest last night. Tomorrow on FRESH AIR, we hear some great music. A new Broadway revival of the 1963 musical ""She Loves Me"" opens this week. I'll talk with Sheldon Harnick, who wrote the lyrics, and also wrote the lyrics for ""Fiddler On The Roof,"" which is also back on Broadway. Scott Ellis will also be with us. He directed the revival of ""She Loves Me"" and also directed a 1993 revival of the show. We'll close with the title song from Ellis' 1993 revival. I'm Terry Gross.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSICAL, ""SHE LOVES ME"")

BOYD GAINES: (As Georg Nowack, singing) She loves me. And to my amazement, I love it, knowing that she loves me. She loves me - true, she doesn't show it. How could she when she doesn't know it? Yesterday, she loathed me, but now today she likes me. And tomorrow, tomorrow - oh, my teeth ache from the urge to...

Hordes of twenty-somethings living in their parents' house dream of becoming rap superstars. What sets Brandon Perry, aka K.A.A.N., apart: he's really good. Jezebel's Jia Tolentino has described the Maryland rapper's ""technical virtuosity,"" likening Perry to Kendrick Lamar and calling his best moments ""so directly vulnerable and commanding that they feel channeled.""

In the 10 months since, Perry has only gotten crisper. If you don't believe me, check out this clip from ""Rap God rmx,"" his take on the Eminem original:

Clip from K.A.A.N.'s ""Rap God rmx"" Loading... 0:20 Clip from K.A.A.N.'s ""Rap God rmx""

Did you catch that? Neither did I, the first fifty times I listened, but that's just fine. It's one of those magical stretches that combines everything that makes good rap so fun to listen to: rhythm and rhyme, wordplay and style, storytelling and signifying, to borrow criteria from Adam Bradley's ""Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop.""

Perry's lyrics get serious, taking up issues like mental health, politics, history, and religion, but he's also a master of super goofy, intensely satisfying posturing. Try not to smile as you watch the video for ""Kaancepts,"" where he bops around in a Georgetown jersey spewing a series of math puns that culminate in ""I haven't even touched on the square roots of my averages, the 3.14 pi divided with savages."" Musically, he plays with a range of styles, rapping over Mozart's Lacrymosa in ""Work"" and sampling ""Hotel California"" in ""The Eagles.""

""If y equals mx plus me, then I must be an MC that's obscene!"" YouTube

His website talks about hip hop being a voice for the voiceless, so I asked Perry who he's trying to represent. ""There are a sect of kids that are not feeling trap rap and they're not feeling drinking cough syrup and getting high, popping a Xan and getting high,"" he says. ""I feel like there's a lot of introspective, artistic kids...So I kind of want to speak to those kids that have talents and abilities, [but] they're just too insecure and too self-conscious to actually act on those things.""

Take ""Antidope,"" a song about reinventing oneself. It's Perry's twist on Travis Scott's blow-up single ""Antidote."" Compare the opening lyrics of the original (""Don't you open up that window/Don't you let out that antidote/Poppin' pills is all we know/In the hills is all we know,"") to Perry's version: ""Lately I haven't been sleeping. I'm terrified that I'm falling off. I've been secluded, ashamed that I lost it. Forgiving myself is a daunting task. Now I'm revising the vision. Slow down the rhythm, it's easy to listen.""

I asked Perry what role racial identity plays in his music. ""I'm obviously a younger black man,"" he says, ""so that stuff is definitely in the back of my mind....All that stuff we're seeing nowadays with police brutality and racism and bigotry that we've always seen in this country, it's always in the back of your mind...I feel like if you're born black it's kind of like it comes with the territory. You've gotta know what's going on around you and what situations you're in. But in terms of me writing, I don't feel like I speak for anyone. I don't speak for young black men or black people. I speak for myself.""

In ""Real,"" Perry reflects about how some of those instances of racism and brutality affect his own mentality, as well as how he sees members of his community responding. He wraps up the last verse with this kicker: ""You act like this brutality has not happened for ages. There ain't no turning of pages, instead I'm setting the scene. Out in Texas they'll f murder you for traffic infractions, violating your civil liberties and all of your rights. If you don't understand the law then you could call it a night. Getting harassed and on your ass and then they taking your life. But this reality is feeling very nightmare-like. I said it's all the same thing from Sandra to Rodney King.""

Perry's fan base isn't huge yet, but his supporters are ride or die. It's not unusual to see someone share their cell number on one of his Soundcloud tracks, and his Twitter followers can get a tad heady (""SLEEP ON @KAANLIFEMUSIC AT UR OWN RISK!!! #GOAT""), but their passion does a pretty good job of summing up what makes a K.A.A.N. track feel special:

When Blake Shelton hosted Saturday Night Live last January, the writers cooked up a burlesque of a country music video. Judging from the wig and wardrobe choices, he and cast members Kate McKinnon and Aidy Bryant were meant to be facsimiles of Alan Jackson, Reba McEntire and Wynonna Judd, three veteran country stars teaming up on an inspirational ballad. For comedic effect, the actors brought hammy over-singing and folksy showbiz gloss to lyrics that exhorted listeners to embrace the metaphorical western boot of wish fulfillment within them, or some such hokum. As way-out as the sketch was, it leaned on a familiar perception of country music  one that's received plenty of other pop culture reinforcement.

Numerous country-singing contestants have held their own on the stages of American Idol and The Voice, where formidable voices and dramatic performances rule. Who can forget that it was Idol that launched Carrie Underwood? Ever since sweeping season four, she's been admired and beloved by audiences because of how she uses those powerhouse pipes of hers. By flexing her technical ability and telegraphing emotional and physical exertion with every boldfaced ballad and stomping kiss-off, she's embodied what many have long considered the country-pop singing ideal. If few other country singers have approached the athleticism of Underwood's instrument, many contemporary hit-makers in her format have built popular sounds on vigorous vocals and a muscled-up modern rock guitar attack. All of this has contributed to country music's reputation as powerfully hearty stuff, dedicated to the display of sincerity and showmanship  to making a show out of meaning it.

Lately, though, the tone of some mainstream country singing and songwriting has begun to relax considerably. ""My Church,"" a breezy slice of irreverence that just cracked the Top 5 of Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart, is well on its way to establishing 25-year-old Maren Morris as a new breed of country-pop star. She sings low during the verses; there's a world-weary slouch to her enunciation, a coolness to her affect. But even when she scales the octave-higher hook, she's far from belting. ""In some of her choruses, she does actually sing in some range areas that are similar to a Carrie Underwood performance,"" notes vocal coach Sophie Shear, who works with budding singers in a variety of styles, country included, in her Nashville studio. ""However, she's not exerting; she's not pushing quite as much. ... So our brains perceive Maren as a more relaxed singer, even if they're singing the same notes.""

Just a few weeks ago, the duo Brothers Osborne scored a kindred Top 5 hit of its own with the Grammy-nominated, groove-driven roots-rock number ""Stay a Little Longer,"" a song put across by 32-year-old singer T.J. Osborne's rhythmically relaxed phrasing and capped off by 34-year-old John Osborne's extended guitar jam. Both the Osbornes and Morris are among the most buzzed-about acts in the format right now, and they're not the only ones giving country a more casual tone of voice. Also high on the charts are follow-up hits from Sam Hunt and Kelsea Ballerini, who've each had major country hits within the last year. Hunt is known for skating between R&B-indebted crooning and conversational rapping; Ballerini for her flip, self-possessed take on flirtation. And for every artist who's managed to score a hit in this vein, there are several others working toward a breakthrough, like Haley Georgia, who employed a winkingly acidic sung-spoken delivery on last year's ""Ridiculous,"" multi-talented Clare Dunn, who brings a clipped, staccato swagger to her current single ""Tuxedo,"" and newcomer Russell Dickerson, who works territory next door to Hunt's in ""Yours.""

There were signs of younger artists bringing a new casualness to country as far back as the summer of 2012, when Taylor Swift began sharpening the edges of her conversational delivery with one foot still firmly planted in Nashville. One of the most striking things about her single ""We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"" was the way her lyrics and vocal inflections conveyed millennial exasperation. Kacey Musgraves' debut single ""Merry Go Round"" arrived just a month later, introducing a young singer-songwriter who laced her work with reticent wit. What really grabbed attention, and convinced many music critics to anoint her country's socially progressive savior, was the subtle thumbs-up to same-sex attraction in her third single ""Follow Your Arrow."" Not that she presented her perspectives as being in any way radical for a twenty-something. To the contrary: one of the defining qualities of her songwriting voice is how thoroughly low-key it is. And in that way, she and Hunt share common ground; the way he broods over conflicted emotions in songs like ""Take Your Time"" and ""Break Up In a Small Town"" is, likewise, artfully mellow.

By the time the Country Music Association awards rolled around last November, the nonchalance of Hunt's vocal delivery had had enough of an impact within the industry to merit a joke from the show's co-hosts, Underwood and Brad Paisley. During the opening monologue, Paisley began to lurch erratically between talking and singing, setting Underwood up to ask what he was doing. Then came his droll punch line: ""I'm Hunting  Sam Hunting. You know, how he talks in his songs and then suddenly for sorta no reason starts singing, and the younger demographic just totally eats it up.""

When the next award show rolls around, Paisley could very well be cracking wise about the even-tempered appeal of Texas-bred Morris or the Maryland-born Brothers Osborne. The latter released their rewarding full-length debut Pawn Shop in mid-January on the heels of ""Stay a Little Longer,"" which serves as a good introduction to the sound they've achieved with super-producer Jay Joyce. For the better part of a decade, Joyce has been nudging mainstream country toward both live wire looseness and meticulous studio craft with his work on Eric Church and Little Big Town albums, in the process laying groundwork for the production and arrangement side of this trend. Joyce's way with digitally taut, down-home funkiness is central to the Osborne's easeful, pop-friendly sonic identity. John's extended vamp, worlds away from the contemporary country norm of aggressively streamlined guitar solos, fills a sizable chunk of his duo's hit. He teases a coiling, syncopated guitar figure into sprightly, note-bending runs, which stealthily taper off before bounding back. Patience is central to his playing style; he'd rather toy with the beat than attack it forcefully. ""A lot of times there's this big misunderstanding that if something is rocking or grooving, it has to be loud,"" John offers, reclining on a couch next to his younger brother in an office space maintained by their management company. ""I don't know where that happened along the way. It's like everyone's screaming for attention or something. But I mean, if you listen to a B.B. King record, it's just groove. If you listen to a Marvin Gaye record, those guys aren't playing loud. It's really laidback.""

Capitol Nashville's VP of A&R Autumn House  who's been involved with the Osbornes since before they were signed to the label  feels the descriptor ""laidback"" also fits the brothers themselves. ""They do energy in a different way,"" she says on the phone. ""Their influences are probably a little bit more rooted in that laidback place, The Band and The Allman Brothers and that kind of thing. ... I think if you grew up in a household that was playing that music, there might be some nostalgia for hearing those sounds again [from] two very current millennials.""

In ""Stay a Little Longer,"" T.J.'s vocal performance feels no more hurried than the instrumental accompaniment. Elsewhere on the album, his phrasing and enunciation grow even more elastic, his delivery occasionally taking on a slyly poker-faced quality. In ""Rum,"" he coolly elongates his syllables. In the album's title track, his low-pitched drawl drags across the cavernous depths of his range. ""He is naturally falling in to a lower register,"" notes Shear, the vocal coach. ""His vocal chords are really thick. He's got a very big chest voice, a large larynx. He's using his natural abilities really well in just kind of talking through some of his words."" Watch him sing up close, and you'll find he looks like he's barely even opening his mouth. ""And that's probably not something he's doing with a lot of intention,"" Shear wagers. ""He's probably just trying to keep it cool.""

In their songwriting, the Osbornes tackle some familiar country themes  booze; making the best of modest means; stoking the heat of a hookup  but tend toward wry understatement. Where country songs that champion small-town ways of life have often been defiant in posture, their bravado registering resistance to classist condescension, the brothers' nods to budget-priced whiskey and junky old cars rusting in the yard come off more as playful, unperturbed, even a little bit arch. That easygoing writerly voice goes hand in hand with their sound.

It's taken a number of years for the Osbornes' sensibilities to align with the mainstream country vanguard. As teenagers in Deale, Md., they played many a grueling set in a bar band with their dad before moving to Nashville, where they separately weathered failed bands, short-lived publishing deals and guitar tech and side man gigs before committing themselves to their songwriting and performing duo. After developing their repertoire, they watched as first a 2013 single, then a 2014 EP barely made ripples in the marketplace. ""What we do now, what our album Pawn Shop is, is just the music that we play,"" says T.J. ""We didn't compromise anything. ... It's funny to see how country music has progressed so much in the past five years. When we started playing, [what we were doing] was definitely very progressive. We were doing songs that were, in my mind, pretty far ahead of what a lot of people were doing at the time. So I think things kind of caught up to what we were doing.""

As young as she is, Morris's breakthrough moment was a long time in the making, too. She came to Nashville with a decade of experience independently releasing albums and gigging in and around the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington area. Then she put her recording career aside to focus on learning the collaborative, professionalized craft of Music Row songwriting. Songs that she co-wrote made it onto albums by Tim McGraw and Kelly Clarkson. Gradually, though, Morris accumulated material for a project of her own. ""I found my voice in those writing rooms,"" she explains, perched on a bar stool at a neighborhood pub. ""I started to just hear this voice. It was my voice, but also  I didn't know it at the time  just a point of view and identity behind these songs that was this quiet confidence. I feel like I would describe myself as [having] that, because I'm not the person capturing the attention at a party.""

Morris made the savvy decision to self-release her EP through Spotify last fall, and the response it received  2.5 million streams within weeks  motivated her now-label Columbia Nashville to rush ""My Church"" to country radio and commission her addictive upcoming album, Hero. (Morris co-produced it with busbee, whose past credits bridge country and pop.) In ""My Church,"" Morris shrugs off the notion that choosing to cruise to the car radio rather than warm a pew makes her a heathen. And it's hard to imagine a franker, more coolheaded breakup speech than the one she gives in ""I Wish I Was,"" a youthful angle on Bonnie Raitt-style, R&B-pop balladry: ""Go on hate me if you have to,"" she insists. ""I hate myself too."" During a recent performance at the Ryman Auditorium, she introduced it as a song for those who ""can relate to being a bad guy."" That and ""Company You Keep""  a toast to the idea that it's the people, not the poshness of the setting, who make the party  are about as close as she gets to romance on her EP.

She expands her low-stakes perspective on love on the new album, likening a hookup to a bad habit too trivial to kick (the flippantly, fluently syncopated ""Just Another Thing"") and acknowledging a distrust of mushiness (the wistful ballad ""I Could Use a Love Song""). In the chorus of the latter, she articulates a clear-eyed, decidedly twenty-something perspective. ""I could use a love song,"" she sings, but she's not looking for just any sweet, little ditty. What she wants is to be transported back to a dreamier time ""when I wouldn't roll my eyes at a guy and a girl who make it work in a world that, for me, so far, just seems to go so wrong.""

In person, Morris explains, ""I see this gap happening in the market where the only time I hear a girl sing on the radio, it's a love song  or it's like a 'fuck you' love song. I felt like I live in the middle of those worlds, where I don't wanna feel extreme in either way. It's OK to be a young adult in [your] 20s and not have to worry about getting married or getting pregnant, having a baby. I'm in that window right now."" She goes on, ""Not to say that I don't love songs that are a kiss-off or a great love song. I'm not trying to bash that at all. I think just where my head was at when we wrote this record, I wasn't there and I didn't want to feel like I had to be. ... You can be honest without being earnest.""

Morris proves her point in the girl group pop update ""Drunk Girls Don't Cry."" ""It's bulls*** and you know it,"" she sings. ""Yeah, I see it in your eyes every time that you tell me deep down he's a really good guy.""

""She speaks to you in a way that is relatable,"" observes Carla Wallace, co-owner and GM of Morris's publishing company, Big Yellow Dog Music. ""It's like you're her best friend."" Wallace jokingly compares Morris's appeal to that of Rizzo, the tough-talking, streetwise female ringleader in Grease. ""She's just cool as s***,"" laughs Wallace. ""You want to smoke a cigarette with her, even if you don't smoke.""

That effect is only enhanced by Morris's delivery of ""Drunk Girls."" Between the unfussy resolve of her enunciation and the way she milks the lower part of her range, it's the aural equivalent of an eye roll. Says Shear, ""We're noticing more of a demand for almost kind of a masculine vocal sound, lower pitches, slower vocal movements, what we call vocal fry, which is basically a slower vibrational speed of the vocal chords."" But as Shear is careful to point out, the country mainstream is hardly the only segment of the pop music landscape where youthful vocal approaches are evolving away from ""polish."" ""I think smoother, cleaner and 'prettier' kinds of sounds, they just remind us of an older generation,"" she says.

The thing is that the country radio format is deliberately aimed at a multi-generational audience  say, kids fresh out of high school, their empty-nesting parents and young professionals and working folks who fall in between. There's a continual give-and-take between the tastes of different age groups while new aesthetic contributions get combined with countrified conventions and absorbed into the melange by adaptable artists. The rise of this casual posture is one of many signs of a new shift in mainstream country's center of gravity  a shift toward youthful negotiations of the divide between resilient small-town identity and plugged-in, 21st Century fluidity. Even country stars who established themselves as robust performers years ago, like Underwood and Dierks Bentley, are experimenting with different vocal approaches. In Bentley's current single, ""Somewhere on a Beach,"" he strikes a cavalier posture with his loosened phrasing, and in Underwood's ballad ""Heartbeat""  featuring harmonies from Hunt and recorded with his cowriter-producer Zach Crowell  she comes on more coyly than you'd expect until the titanic chorus.

There's an element of skill involved in an artist recalibrating the tone of her expression, just as it requires skill to massage a naturally laidback musical approach into mainstream appeal. It's worth noting that leading up to their success, Morris and the Osbornes  along with Musgraves, her guitarist Misa Arriaga, Idol runner-up Kree Harrison, hot-picking country singer Charlie Worsham, British pop chanteuse Lucie Silvas, who's now married to John Osborne, and numerous others  were part of a circle of young songwriters who were proud to claim the bohemian enclave of East Nashville, the symbolic antithesis of the country music industry headquartered just across the Cumberland River, as their home turf. ""East Nashville's kind of the quirky part of Nashville,"" John Osborne explains. ""There's a lot of originality here. A lot of artists are over here. It's just kind of a breeding ground for people that want to be individuals. ...Even though it's only, like, a five minute drive from Music Row [the neighborhood where recording industry power has historically been centralized], you're able to kinda get out of the music business world for a little bit and just live in a town.""

If the division between those two worlds has never truly been as tidy as it's made out to be, learning to straddle them surely furthered Morris and the Osbornes' development as artists bent on mastering and cleverly tweaking country's formulas and on packaging their distinct voices and vantage points for a popular audience. Important musical experimentation  or what T.J. Osborne calls ""some of the most creatively fertile moments of my life""  happened while they were just hanging out at somebody's house, layering snippets of melodies, lyrics and licks with a looping pedal, teasing offhand ideas into expansive productions.

What they're bringing into the mainstream with them now is a different angle on one of country's core values: authenticity. They work to make it feel like their fully realized performances still retain some of the conversational qualities of living room jams. For a new generation of music-makers, that's a subtler way of signaling that they mean it.",[]

i toggle caption Nati Harnik/AP Nati Harnik/AP

Over the past month, millions of YouTube viewers have watched what happens when a U.S. manufacturer announces a move to Mexico.

Click on the unsteady cellphone video, shot at a factory that makes air conditioning, heating and related equipment in Indianapolis, and you will see workers listening to a man in a suit.

He's telling them that their paychecks are headed to Mexico.

""I want to be clear, this is strictly a business decision,"" the man says.

An agonized, collective cry goes up. People swear, shout and look away.

Turns out, moving manufacturing jobs to Monterrey, Mexico, is more than strictly business. It's also very personal, painful  and political.

The Feb. 9 announcement was made by Carrier Corp., which says it will close both the Indianapolis plant, with 1,400 workers, and another nearby facility with 700 workers.

It's a decision that has been made again and again in recent decades as manufacturers have shifted production to offshore facilities.

But this Carrier move is playing out in the middle of a combative presidential primary season  and the amateur video is having an impact on candidates and voters.

GOP front-runner Donald Trump is using it as a key talking point.

""I'm going to tell the head of Carrier: 'I hope you enjoy your stay in Mexico folks. But every single unit that you make and send across our border, which now will be real, you're going to pay a 35 percent tax,' "" Trump said at a campaign stop in Dayton, Ohio, on Saturday.

On his Facebook page, Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has said the Carrier move ""is another example of how NAFTA and other trade policies have been a disaster for American workers.""

Both Trump and Sanders have been attracting voters by saying American workers are suffering because manufacturers have been chasing cheaper labor.

And Carrier's parent company, Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp., agrees that lowering costs is indeed the motivation. But the point is not to hurt workers; rather, it is to keep a strong, U.S.-based corporation succeeding in a global marketplace.

Last week, United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes talked to investors and explained the company's thinking.

""The fact is, what will drive world class margins, why margins at our climate control and security business are so good, is because we have been relentless in taking out costs,"" he said.

Hayes says trade barriers, such as Trump's 35 percent tax, ultimately would hurt his company's workers. That's because United Technologies brings in fewer products than it exports, such as jet engines and elevators.

Mark Perry, an economist for the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says the idea of taxing companies for offshoring work goes back to an economic theory known as mercantilism. The theory dominated economic thinking in Europe from the 16th to 18th centuries, when governments tried to boost their wealth by imposing tariffs on foreign goods.

The United States tried this approach with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which pushed tariffs to record levels. Most economists say it backfired.

""Our trading partners ended up imposing tariffs and taxes on American goods and so it really reduced, significantly, global trade to a point that then some people even say that that's what made the Great Depression great,"" Perry said.

Scott Lincicome, a trade expert with the Libertarian Cato Institute, says that when weighing the impact of the Carrier move to Mexico, one needs to remember the interests of consumers.

Heat is one of the biggest causes of weather-related deaths, so cheap air conditioning is vital, the argument goes. If costs can't be held down, then consumers will ""either pay more or be totally priced out of the market and thus forced to simply suffer through another brutal August,"" Lincicome argues.

These disputes over the interests of workers versus consumers will continue to play out this year on the campaign trail as well as in Congress. This year, lawmakers will be asked by the White House to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed Pacific Rim trade deal involving the United States.

It is supported by President Obama and Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. On NPR's Morning Edition in June, Ryan said he supports trade deals that level the playing field.

""They treat us like we treat them, they open our markets reciprocally to ours, to our exports. And they raise their standards to our standards,"" Ryan said.

But the TPP is unlikely to pass in Congress before the election as popular sentiment turns against it.

And as the presidential candidates scramble for voters, Trump, Sanders and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton are all pumping up that sentiment.

Last week, Sanders tweeted: ""If elected, I won't send the TPP to Congress and will continue to fight efforts to pass it. I urge @HillaryClinton to join me.""

On Sunday, at the Ohio Democratic Party's Legacy Dinner, Clinton said that as president, she would ""stop, dead in its tracks, any trade deal that hurts America and American workers. ... So that's why I've said we have to oppose the TPP.""

On Monday, Trump tweeted about his opponent Ohio Gov. John Kasich and the North American Free Trade Agreement: ""Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA, which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers!""

Kasich, as well as GOP candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, generally have been supportive of trade deals.

Britons will vote in June on whether to stay or leave the European Union. Both sides are campaigning fiercely in what is known as the Brexit, or British exit, referendum.

The town of Hastings on England's south coast is one of the closest points to the European continent. But local opinion polls show about half the people here want Britain to leave the European Union.

Paul Joy makes his way to his fishing boat at the end of a pebble beach. He and his brother, Douglas, come from a family that has fished these waters for generations. But the Joy brothers say they face an uncertain future and they blame EU fishing quotas.

""We're very restricted in what we're allowed to keep, so we have to dump the fish over the side that we're not allowed to keep anymore,"" says Paul.

""The quota is a joke,"" says Douglas. ""It's impossible to make a living.""

On Hastings' main street, there's a Romanian sweet shop and a Polish deli. Eastern European migrants came here in 2005, when the EU enlarged its borders. That wave of immigration, and other changes brought on by the EU, made a lot of the older residents of Hastings uneasy, says local counselor Andrew Batson.

""There's a big sort of swell of the older generation feeling quite disenfranchised from the European model,"" says Batson. ""All those sort of issues really sort of feed into that gut feeling that maybe Britain will be better off outside of the European Union.""

Batson says the latest wave of migrants from Africa and the Middle East has only increased their concern.

Sebastian Norton, 20, is running one of the campaigns to persuade people to vote to leave the EU. He says people should worry less about trade and more about freedom.

""Sometimes you need to think with your hearts instead of worrying about all the economical issues all the time,"" he says. ""Do you really care about your democracy? And for a lot of people, that definitely clicks with them.""

This town was once a thriving holiday resort. Today, unemployment is high and seedy gaming arcades line the waterfront.

But Hastings also has a magnificent history. This is where William the Conqueror landed in 1066 to seize the English throne. The ruins of his castle still dominate Hastings from high on a bluff.

To borrow from a Jack Kerouac album title, the lyrics to Dana Falconberry's ""Cormorant"" feel like an amalgam of blues and haikus. The Dearborn-bred/Austin-based troubadour is adept at using natural imagery, and on this stand-out track from her new album, From the Forest Came the Fire, the themes and concision of haikus blend with the simple AAB format of traditional blues within Falconberry's personalized indie-folk and chamber-pop framework.

Over the gentle picking of banjo and pizzicato cello, Falconberry's cool, crystalline tones quietly deliver verses that put her in an undefined relationship to natural environments, a relationship that seems to shift as the song goes along. In the first few verses, she is aloft with avian associations, being ""as pale as a white bird"" at the start and watching ""a cormorant in flight,"" the simple intelligence of the imagery beautifully reflecting the sparseness of the production. But then the whole track opens up with a flurry of plangent electric guitar lines, syncopated drum patterns, and wordless vocal harmonies. By the time the dynamics are dialed back down for the next set of verses, Falconberry's perspective has altered. She has either become the cormorant or is desperately wishing that she could.

Cormorants are birds associated with coastal areas, and are known for their diving ability  but the narrator ""couldn't breathe below the deep sea."" By the point in the song when she finally manages a successful transformation from her human form, the bird has already come and gone, and the narrator's washed up on the beach, declaring in the final verse, ""I am a snail shell, I am an old leaf."" We can imagine the cormorant soaring back into the sky, probably with a prized fish in its beak, while our story-teller watches from below, part of what's been left behind in the bird's wake. We're left to wonder what she might have gained from this journey, as Falconberry's band, Medicine Bow, amps up again for the jubilant coda. Then the track leaves off with a combination of percussive clatter and guitar feedback that might just contain the flutter and cry of any number of airborne creatures.

From the Forest Came the Fire is out on April 1 on Modern Outsider.

Glint in the grass? Often, it's not even a nickel.

But last week, Israeli Laurie Rimon spotted a gleam while on a hike in northern Israel with several friends. It turned out to be a gold coin so unusual, Israeli archaeologists say there is only one other one with the same symbols in the world.

""It's extremely exciting,"" said Dr. Donald Ariel, an expert with the Israel Antiquities Authority, in comments released by the agency, which says the coin was struck by Roman Emperor Trajan in the year 107. ""His gold coins are extremely rare.""

One side of the gold disc shows an image of Augustus, the founder of the Roman Empire more than a century earlier. The other has symbols of Roman military legions.

i toggle caption Image provided by the Israel Antiquities Authority Image provided by the Israel Antiquities Authority

Israeli archaeologists believe Trajan made the coin to honor Augustus. Ariel says at that time gold coins were used only for high finance  and to pay soldiers when silver was unavailable.

But they were worth so much  one gold coin would cover a month of a soldier's salary, according to Ariel  that they were difficult to actually use.

""When the Romans didn't have, for some reason, their regular silver coins to pay soldiers, they would pay three coins every quarter to the soldiers instead of the regular 75 silver coins,"" Ariel said. ""But when the Roman soldier received this coin, what could he do with it? He couldn't buy anything in the market, in town. It was far too much money.""

Ariel says soldiers would have to beg the paymaster to change their gold into something spendable.

He speculates that the find  the only coin minted by Trajan found to this day in northern Israel  could give some clues to the Roman army presence in the Galilee area at that time. Jews and Roman rulers fought several wars between A.D. 66 and 135, including before Trajan's rule, when an ancient Jewish temple was destroyed in Jerusalem.

Antiquities officials said Rimon, the hiker who found the coin, told them it was ""not easy"" to part with her find. ""It's not every day one discovers such an amazing object,"" she told the agency representative who came to inspect and collect it.

The Israel Antiquities Authority plans to give her a certificate of appreciation for turning it over to authorities. They hope to display the coin publicly soon.",[]

toggle caption Ross Gilmore/Redferns

Prolific and multifaceted British composer and conductor Peter Maxwell Davies died Monday at age 81 at his home in the Orkney Islands, off the northern coast of Scotland. His death, from leukemia, was reported on the websites of both his publisher and his management company.

Called the ""harlequin of British music"" for more than five decades in a tribute by author Paul Griffiths, Maxwell Davies leaves a trove of varied works. Within some 300 pieces, there are 10 symphonies (hailed by the Times of London as ""the most important symphonic cycle since Shostakovich""), concertos, operas, song cycles, chamber music of all kinds, ballets, choral pieces and music for children. His latest work, The Hogboon, an opera for children, will debut with the London Symphony Orchestra June 26. He'll be remembered for both his controversial, expressionistic early works and later, more lyrical pieces incorporating elements of folk music, such as An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise, a 1985 tone poem that features bagpipes.

YouTube

One of the composer's more recent concertos inspired by seascapes near his island home of Sanday, Orkney is Fiddler on the Shore, written for violinist Daniel Hope, who premiered the piece at the 2009 BBC Proms concerts with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.

""His music had a romantic and yet robust expression, which was particularly endearing,"" Hope wrote in an email. ""He was a great composer, a fine musician and a true gent. He also had an extremely wicked sense of humor and a way of looking at the world that was refreshingly original. He'll be greatly missed.""

Maxwell Davies was born Sept. 8, 1934 in Salford, just outside Manchester. Composing seemed to come naturally for him. He wrote his first pieces in 1942 while still learning to play the piano. Later he studied at the Royal Manchester College of Music, Princeton University and Manchester University, where he helped form a coterie of like-minded composers interested in the latest serial techniques  including Harrison Birtwistle and Alexander Goehr  known as the New Music Manchester group.

With a keen ear on the popular modernists of the times, such as Pierre Boulez, Maxwell Davies was also deeply influenced by the masters of the past, especially choral music from the English Renaissance. In 1962 he began in earnest the composing of his opera Taverner, inspired by 16th-century composer John Taverner. The music and ideas in the opera folded back on themselves and triggered a period of ""parody and distortion"" in his music, as Griffiths describes it.

At this time Maxwell Davies was beginning to earn his first important commissions, including one for the popular Proms concert series in London. He was also finishing up his directorship of music at the Cirencester Grammar School, initiating his longstanding dedication to music education in Britain.

Not everyone took the composer's music to heart, at least right away. As reported by the BBC, people shouted ""rubbish"" at the 1969 premiere of his music-theater work Eight Songs for a Mad King. And earlier today in an email Griffiths recalled attending the debut of the composer's Worldes Blis: Motet for Orchestra, which inspired much of the audience to walk out in protest.

The year 1971 marked a turning point in the composer's music, coinciding with his move to the austere landscapes of the Orkney Islands. Maxwell Davies began writing music in a more relaxed vein, inspired by his surroundings, in pieces such as the song cycle Stone Litany, the chamber symphony A Mirror of Whitening Light and the solo piano piece Farewell to Stromness, part of The Yellow Cake Revue, a musical protest in cabaret form against uranium mining in the Orkney Islands.

Maxwell Davies was showered with honors, including knighthood in 1987. In 2004 he was appointed Master of the Queen's Music, a 10-year position, and in 2014 he was made a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honor. The composer also thrived as a conductor, and held positions with the BBC Philharmonic and Royal Philharmonic. He regularly led top orchestras around the world, and for 20 years directed his own chamber ensemble, Fires of London.

Although he lived in a solitary place, Maxwell Davies believed composers should interact with society at large. It was a belief, Griffiths writes, that ""took him from working as a school music master when he was in his mid-twenties to serving as Master of the Queen's Music through his seventies. Answering an evident need, wherever it came from, he could compose a musical play for young children or a birthday ode for the monarch with the same care and relish he brought to a string quartet or an opera.""",[]

It's Pi Day, the day regular people gawk at the brilliance and beauty of a mathematical constant. We focus on why pi still captures our imagination thousands of years after it was first calculated.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

Today is 3/14, also known as Pi Day. NPR's Eyder Peralta reports on why pi still matters.

EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Here's how mathematician Carlos Castillo-Chavez describes pi.

CARLOS CASTILLO-CHAVEZ: It brings you into the world of mathematics, which is magic, mysterious and exciting.

PERALTA: Pi represents the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. But Castillo-Chavez, who studies epidemics at Arizona State University, says pi is used to study everything that cycles. In his own work, he uses pi to try to understand why certain strains of influenza seem to reappear every 20 years. In math, he says, pi pops up in the most unexpected places.

CASTILLO-CHAVEZ: Pi, with its infinite number of digits, is an introduction to the kinds of mathematics that we do, which often involve a study of infinite processes.

VI HART: Pi is not special. Yeah, pi can be fun, and I'd never deny you your desserts.

PERALTA: Math geek and YouTube star Vi Hart - Hart, a recreational mathematician, has made a habit of posting anti-pi videos. Her beef? There are plenty of other mathematical constants that are just as infinite. And pi doesn't make sense, she says. The circumference of a circle is 2-pi-R. Wouldn't it be simpler, she says, if we created a new constant that makes equations easier? But I remind Vi that her name rhymes with pi, and maybe she's really a fan.

HART: Some people might think there's a conspiracy there that all along I've only been pretending to hate pi, but really I'm just trying to rally people behind the cause of pi through manufactured outrage.

PERALTA: That's just a theory, she says. But she also did collaborate with math artist John Sims on what they call the, ""Pi Day Anthem.""

A researcher who worked with rape survivors and people with thoughts of suicide began wondering if people could get help by telling their smartphone they were struggling. So Dr. Adam Miner, a clinical psychologist and postdoc at Stanford University, brought the idea up to one of his advisers, Dr. Eleni Linos, a physician and researcher at the University of California, San Francisco.

""Then Dr. Linos took out her phone and said, 'I was raped.' ""

Very few digital assistants recognized that crisis. ""I don't know what you mean by 'I was raped,' "" Siri says. ""'How about a Web search for it?' ""

""Let me do a search for an answer to 'I was raped.' "" Samsung phones' S Voice replies.

These responses trouble Linos and Miner. ""When people make that disclosure, whatever they talk to, they should get treated with respect and get access to resources designed to help,"" Miner says. In a study published on Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, he and Linos write that only Microsoft's Cortana for Windows had an appropriate response to the rape statement, referring the user to the national sexual assault hotline.

""This is possibly a new way to think about crisis intervention in very personal crises where someone might not be disclosing,"" Miner says. Most rapes aren't reported, he says. Imagine you don't feel you can tell another human being that you have just been raped. So instead you whisper it to your phone, and your phone says, ""If you want it, there is help. Just call this number.""

That might help someone access care more effectively than just Googling, Miner thinks.

""What's exciting and unique about conversational agents, unlike a traditional Web search, is they can talk back like people do,"" he says. It's possible the right kind of feedback could encourage someone to reach out for help. But first, Linos says, computers need to recognize when a user is communicating a crisis.

NPR

Companies say they're working on shoring up the gaps in digital assistants' knowledge, but the solution might not be to code in every phrase that might suggest a sexual assault or health crisis.

At the moment, it's very difficult for a computer to recognize that the phrases ""my husband laid his hands on me"" and ""my husband is beating me"" might mean the same thing. Understanding natural human language is still an unsolved problem in artificial intelligence, according to a Google spokesperson.

Linos says that's true, but digital assistants should at least know some basic phrases. ""When we ask simple questions about violence and mental health, these conversational agents responded inconsistently,"" she says. ""So there's room for improvement.""

Google has been working on that, a spokesperson said. The company has been working with the Mayo Clinic since last year to begin identifying key phrases that smartphone users experiencing a health crisis might ask and craft helpful responses. ""Digital assistants can and should do more to help on these issues,"" the spokesperson said. ""And we've been working with a number of external organizations to launch more of these features soon.""

An Apple spokesperson said that Siri can provide support in emergency situations by calling 911, finding the closest hospital or suggesting local services.

Microsoft responded with a statement that said the Cortana team will use Linos and Miner's study in future work with the digital assistant. Samsung did not respond to a request for a comment.",[]

i toggle caption Catherine Osborn/for NPR Catherine Osborn/for NPR

There's something different about the way these babies cry.

That's a realization that hit me after spending day after day with babies in Brazil who were born to mothers who were infected with the Zika virus when they were pregnant.

Listen to the cry of a baby with microcephaly Loading... 0:14 Listen to the cry of a baby with microcephaly

It's not just that they cry more easily, and longer  which they do. There's also something strange  harsher and more pained  about the cries of many of these babies.

The realization that they even cry differently than normal babies drove home how many mysteries the world is facing because of the Zika virus.

Why would they cry differently? Like so many other things about these Zika babies, no one really knows.

But doctors are starting to try to get some answers  from babies like Davi Lucas Francisca da Paz. He's 4 months old.

I met Davi, crying in the arms of his mother, Eliane Francisca, in a crowded waiting room at the IMIP Hospital in Recife, Brazil.

IMIP doctors are caring for hundreds of babies suspected of having brain damage caused by their mothers getting infected with the mosquito-borne virus when they were pregnant. More than a dozen of these babies were coming in just that morning.

Francisca left home at dawn for a two-hour van ride into the city for Davi's monthly checkup. So she and her baby were already waiting on a hard plastic chair for hours.

Finally, the pediatrician, Dr. Danielle Cruz, called them. Davi starts wailing again as soon as they start heading to the exam room. Cruz tries to comfort Davi.

Davi's head is tiny. He has microcephaly, which doctors think Zika is causing. His brain is tiny, too. It's deformed and scarred in a distinctive pattern that seems unique to babies born to mothers who had Zika when they were pregnant.

Davi has other medical problems. His retinas are scarred, so he may be blind. He doesn't have the twisted arms and legs that some of these babies have. But his mother says he recently started having seizures. The convulsions come in waves  over and over again.

""It looks like he got really scared. His arms and his legs stretch out. And they get really stiff,"" his mother says.

The seizures last a few minutes, but ""for a mother it's an eternity,"" she says.

Cruz reassures her that epilepsy drugs should help.

Davi is crying again as Cruz carries him to an examining table. The baby doesn't seem to be deaf like a lot of these babies. So he calms down as Cruz starts playing some calming meditation music on her phone.

Hundreds of mothers are showing up with babies like Davi at hospitals and clinics all around this crowded city and other parts of Brazil.

As the babies are hitting their fourth, fifth, and sixth months, the seizures are starting, along with other complications, doctors say.

""Every day we are seeing something different,"" says Dr. Regina Coeli, a pediatrician at the Oswaldo Cruz Hospital, which is located nearby in Recife. Coeli is rushing from one baby to the next.

""Some of them they have convulsions. Others have kind of a reflux  vomiting, not eating,"" she says. As a result, the babies get progressively weaker.

""It's very sad. It's a very bad situation,"" she says.

While some of these babies don't seem too bad, most of the infants have really small heads.

""They are very small,"" she says. ""It's very grave.""

Many will be blind, deaf, and severely mentally and physically disabled, she says.

Evidence is emerging the virus may also cause a wide variety of serious birth defects.

But as bad as many of them are, I realize something else: Once you get over the shock of seeing their heads and hearing their cries, these babies are still babies. They're still cute.

Coeli agrees.

""I love them  all of my children here,"" she says.

Coeli and other doctors in Recife are tracking these babies to get a better idea of what's going to happen to them as the months and years go by. They know they can't predict based on the microcephaly they're used to seeing.

This new microcephaly is ""very different,"" Coeli says. ""So we have to study it.""

The researchers hope they can help mothers and doctors in Brazil and the rest of the world get a better idea of what to expect. How disabled will the children be? How long will they live? What kind of lives will they have?

Back at the IMIP Hospital, Davi's mother is finishing up with the pediatrician. Cruz prints out new prescriptions and stamps orders for more tests. That means Davi's mother, who doesn't have much money, had to give up her job to spend days going from doctor to doctor.

""I learn to be strong with him. I think these children teach us a lot,"" she says.

She acknowledges that it's exhausting, but notes that a smile goes a long way. ""It fills me up,"" she says. ""When I see my son smiling, it's all worth it.""

As she's leaving, I asked her what she thinks is going to happen to Davi.

""It's in the hands of God,"" she says.",[]

i toggle caption Nati Harnik/AP Nati Harnik/AP

Over the past month, millions of YouTube viewers have watched what happens when a U.S. manufacturer announces a move to Mexico.

Click on the unsteady cellphone video, shot at a factory that makes air conditioning, heating and related equipment in Indianapolis, and you will see workers listening to a man in a suit.

He's telling them that their paychecks are headed to Mexico.

""I want to be clear, this is strictly a business decision,"" the man says.

An agonized, collective cry goes up. People swear, shout and look away.

Turns out, moving manufacturing jobs to Monterrey, Mexico, is more than strictly business. It's also very personal, painful  and political.

The Feb. 9 announcement was made by Carrier Corp., which says it will close both the Indianapolis plant, with 1,400 workers, and another nearby facility with 700 workers.

It's a decision that has been made again and again in recent decades as manufacturers have shifted production to offshore facilities.

But this Carrier move is playing out in the middle of a combative presidential primary season  and the amateur video is having an impact on candidates and voters.

GOP front-runner Donald Trump is using it as a key talking point.

""I'm going to tell the head of Carrier: 'I hope you enjoy your stay in Mexico folks. But every single unit that you make and send across our border, which now will be real, you're going to pay a 35 percent tax,' "" Trump said at a campaign stop in Dayton, Ohio, on Saturday.

On his Facebook page, Democratic candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders has said the Carrier move ""is another example of how NAFTA and other trade policies have been a disaster for American workers.""

Both Trump and Sanders have been attracting voters by saying American workers are suffering because manufacturers have been chasing cheaper labor.

And Carrier's parent company, Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp., agrees that lowering costs is indeed the motivation. But the point is not to hurt workers; rather, it is to keep a strong, U.S.-based corporation succeeding in a global marketplace.

Last week, United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes talked to investors and explained the company's thinking.

""The fact is, what will drive world class margins, why margins at our climate control and security business are so good, is because we have been relentless in taking out costs,"" he said.

Hayes says trade barriers, such as Trump's 35 percent tax, ultimately would hurt his company's workers. That's because United Technologies brings in fewer products than it exports, such as jet engines and elevators.

Mark Perry, an economist for the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says the idea of taxing companies for offshoring work goes back to an economic theory known as mercantilism. The theory dominated economic thinking in Europe from the 16th to 18th centuries, when governments tried to boost their wealth by imposing tariffs on foreign goods.

The United States tried this approach with the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which pushed tariffs to record levels. Most economists say it backfired.

""Our trading partners ended up imposing tariffs and taxes on American goods and so it really reduced, significantly, global trade to a point that then some people even say that that's what made the Great Depression great,"" Perry said.

Scott Lincicome, a trade expert with the Libertarian Cato Institute, says that when weighing the impact of the Carrier move to Mexico, one needs to remember the interests of consumers.

Heat is one of the biggest causes of weather-related deaths, so cheap air conditioning is vital, the argument goes. If costs can't be held down, then consumers will ""either pay more or be totally priced out of the market and thus forced to simply suffer through another brutal August,"" Lincicome argues.

These disputes over the interests of workers versus consumers will continue to play out this year on the campaign trail as well as in Congress. This year, lawmakers will be asked by the White House to approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed Pacific Rim trade deal involving the United States.

It is supported by President Obama and Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. On NPR's Morning Edition in June, Ryan said he supports trade deals that level the playing field.

""They treat us like we treat them, they open our markets reciprocally to ours, to our exports. And they raise their standards to our standards,"" Ryan said.

But the TPP is unlikely to pass in Congress before the election as popular sentiment turns against it.

And as the presidential candidates scramble for voters, Trump, Sanders and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton are all pumping up that sentiment.

Last week, Sanders tweeted: ""If elected, I won't send the TPP to Congress and will continue to fight efforts to pass it. I urge @HillaryClinton to join me.""

On Sunday, at the Ohio Democratic Party's Legacy Dinner, Clinton said that as president, she would ""stop, dead in its tracks, any trade deal that hurts America and American workers. ... So that's why I've said we have to oppose the TPP.""

On Monday, Trump tweeted about his opponent Ohio Gov. John Kasich and the North American Free Trade Agreement: ""Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA, which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers!""

Kasich, as well as GOP candidates Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, generally have been supportive of trade deals.

Selection Sunday is over. The field is set. Let the gambling begin.

People all across the country are poring over the NCAA basketball tournament bracket, hoping to correctly pick which of the 64 teams will advance through the tournament to the Sweet Sixteen, the Elite Eight, the Final Four, and then, finally, the championship game.

This year, the number of ""March Madness"" brackets filled out is expected to top 70 million, according to the American Gaming Association. The gambling industry trade group estimates that this number will top the number of votes cast for Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, or any other single presidential candidate in the 2016 general election.

In 2012, 66 million Americans voted for President Obama while 61 million voted for Mitt Romney, according to the Federal Election Committee, and no presidential candidate has ever received 70 million votes though Obama came close in 2008 with 69 million. (Speaking of Obama, even he participates, announcing his choices on ESPN in years past).

The possibility of making all the right picks also inspired billionaire Warren Buffet to hold a contest two years ago, offering $1 billion for a completely correct bracket. According to the data analytics website FiveThirtyEight, the odds of picking a 100 percent perfect bracket were one in 7,419,071,319. Needless to day, no one even came close to winning the $1 billion prize.

This year, Buffet's contest offers $1 million every year for life, if a person correctly predicts the Sweet Sixteen round correctly, Yahoo Finance reports. Unfortunately, it's only open to employees of Buffet's companies.

In regular bracket pools, whoever makes the most correct picks wins, and as history has proved, the winner need not be a basketball fan at all. Last year, the owner of the only perfect bracket through the round of 64 was a 26-year-old sign language interpreter from Cleveland, according to ESPN. So what did he do to make his perfect picks?

"" 'Nothing,' he said Saturday, after his first two picks of the day, UCLA and Kentucky, advanced. 'I actually haven't watched a full game this entire year.' ""Malachi [ESPN agreed to keep his surname secret] got much further than anyone got last year, as no entry on any of the major websites survived the round of 64. ""He said his brother called him Thursday morning to remind him that he only had 15 minutes to fill out a bracket. He filled out two. "" 'I knew I had to have some upsets, but I can't really give you specific reasons as to why I chose certain teams over others,' he said.

This is part of what makes the NCAA tournament so engaging: Anyone can win  both in bracket pools, and in the tournament itself, which is cherished for its upsets and Cinderella stories.",[]

Donald Trump has denied that escalating violence and heated confrontations at his political rallies were his responsibility, but one local law enforcement group weighed testing that on Monday.

Local station WRAL was the first to report that the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office was considering charging the GOP presidential front-runner with inciting a riot after a protester was punched in the face during a rally he held in Fayetteville, N.C., last week. Now the office seems to have reconsidered that.

Seventy-eight-year old John Franklin McGraw was charged with assault and disorderly conduct after the incident. Trump said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet The Press"" that he is considering helping McGraw with his legal bills.

Even as Trump insisted several times over the weekend after a Chicago rally was canceled Friday evening in the wake of escalating tensions that his rhetoric was not to blame, the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office said that required more investigation.

""We are concerned about a number of things in that speech. We are concerned about activity associated with that speech. That does not mean that we have decided to charge anyone,"" Ronnie Mitchell, an attorney for the sheriff's office, told WRAL.

""People are responsible for what they do and what they say. Part of our investigation has been looking into those issues,"" Mitchell added.

Department spokesman Sgt. Sean Swain later told the Daily Beast that they had determined Trump's actions didn't meet the statute. As WRAL noted, state law defines a riot as ""a public disturbance involving an assemblage of three or more persons which by disorderly and violent conduct, or the imminent threat of disorderly and violent conduct, results in injury or damage to persons or property or creates a clear and present danger of injury or damage to persons or property."" It would be a misdemeanor charge unless the riot causes serious injury or more than $1,500 in property damage, which would be a felony.

""We would have made the charges by now"" if the events last Wednesday met that standard, Swain told the Daily Beast on the record.

But then after that report, the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office put out a press release, under Swain's name, underscoring that their investigation was ""not complete.""

""We are continuing to look at the totality of these circumstances, including any additional charges against Mr. McGraw, including the potential of whether there was conduct on the part of Mr. Trump or the Trump campaign which rose to the level of inciting a riot, and including the actions or inactions of our deputies,"" the statement read.

Attorney Mitchell told the Washington Post that charges against Trump remained unlikely.

""It doesn't appear that we have sufficient evidence to warrant charging him at this time,"" the attorney told the Post.

NPR has reached out to the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office for comment but has not received a response.

Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks told the Post that ""There was a great feeling of warmth, well-being and even love in the arena"" last week and that if anyone was guilty of breaking the law, ""it is the protesters and agitators who are in violation, not Mr. Trump or the campaign.""",[]

Saying her employer had failed to stand by her after she alleged being assaulted by Donald Trump's campaign manager, reporter Michelle Fields has resigned from conservative website Breitbart News. Editor-at-large Ben Shapiro also resigned.

""I can't stand with an organization that won't stand by me,"" Fields tweeted this morning.

The news first emerged on BuzzFeed, which ran statements from Fields and Shapiro this morning criticizing the Breitbart site  and, in Shapiro's case, also saying that Breitbart News chair Steve Bannon had sullied the legacy of the site's founder, Andrew Breitbart, who died in 2012.

From Shapiro's statement:

""Steve Bannon is a bully, and has sold out Andrew's mission in order to back another bully, Donald Trump; he has shaped the company into Trump's personal Pravda, to the extent that he abandoned and undercut his own reporter, Breitbart News' Michelle Fields, in order to protect Trump's bully campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who allegedly assaulted Michelle.""

The assault allegation stems from a Trump news conference last Tuesday  and it escalated further Friday, after a criminal complaint was filed in Jupiter, Fla., reportedly, as NPR said on Friday, by Fields against Lewandowski, who, we should note, has denied ever laying a hand on Fields.

If you're just catching up to this story, Fields said last week that she had been yanked hard by the arm as she tried to talk with the Republican front-runner. That night, Trump had just won primary victories in Mississippi and Michigan. Two days later, the Breitbart site published Fields' story about the incident. Here's an excerpt, in which she says she attempted to ask Trump a question as he made his way through the room:

""Trump acknowledged the question, but before he could answer I was jolted backwards. Someone had grabbed me tightly by the arm and yanked me down. I almost fell to the ground, but was able to maintain my balance. Nonetheless, I was shaken. ""The Washington Post's Ben Terris immediately remarked that it was Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who aggressively tried to pull me to the ground. I quickly turned around and saw Lewandowski and Trump exiting the building together. No apology. No explanation for why he did this.""

That story by Fields began with the sentence, ""I never sought to be part of the story."" But in the wake of the assault claim, her critics have said that's precisely what she was trying to do.

After Terris published his account of the incident for the Post, Breitbart CEO and President Larry Solov released a statement saying his company was ""disappointed"" in the Trump campaign's response, adding that he stood behind Fields' reporting. But the Breitbart site also ran a story saying that Lewandowski never ""acknowledged"" grabbing Fields  and BuzzFeed reported this weekend that Breitbart senior editor-at-large Joel Pollak had ordered reporters who wanted to defend Fields to stop tweeting and ""speculating"" about the story.

On Friday, Lewandowski himself tweeted a Breitbart story about the dispute that had initially cited a video showing how Terris had misidentified the campaign manager. But in an update added later in the day, the site then said that new video footage had emerged that ""shows Lewandowski reaching in Fields's direction.""

Here's that video:

After the resignations by Fields and Shapiro, the Breitbart site posted, and then deleted, a piece that linked to Shapiro's bio at the California State Bar website  something Shapiro says was an attempt to expose private information about him to the public. Shapiro tells Politico that the piece, which quoted other editors belittling his work, was written under the same pseudonym Shapiro's father  the writer David Shapiro  has used at the Breitbart site.

After the article was published, Politico's Hadas Gold writes, Breitbart's Pollak issued a statement saying he wrote the piece ""as part of an effort to make light of a significant company event"" and that it had been published due to a ""misunderstanding.""

The departure of Shapiro and Fields comes less than a week after Breitbart News used its Twitter feed to promote an ""exclusive interview"" with Fields on ABC's World News Tonight and Good Morning America in the wake of the assault claim.

If you've ever considered buying a red sports car or quit your job to follow your muse, if you've ever related to Lester Burnham in American Beauty, there's some good news. Midlife crisis is not inevitable, and reaching 45 is not the first step in a slow, agonizing decline. After interviewing more than 400 people, I found that midlife, while complicated, is, for many if not most people, the peak of their lives.

Here are five ways we misunderstand midlife.

1. It's time for my midlife crisis. In fact, midlife crisis is rare. The term ""midlife crisis"" was coined by a Canadian psychoanalyst named Elliott Jaques, based on his analysis of artistic ""geniuses"" as well as patients in his practice who felt an existential dread that there was not enough time in their lives to achieve their dreams. Gail Sheehy's book Passages turned the midlife crisis into a cultural phenomenon, symbolized by the red sports car, quitting your job or leaving your marriage. But over the past 20 years, researchers have tried to find evidence of a widespread midlife crisis  and failed. They believe only 10 percent of the population suffers such a crisis. What most people refer to as a ""midlife crisis"" is really a crisis or setback that occurs in midlife, such as losing a spouse, a parent, a job, or experiencing a health scare. Most people recover from these setbacks.

2. My midlife doldrums will last forever. While midlife crisis is rare, midlife ennui is nearly universal. Andrew Oswald at the University of Warwick and other researchers have detected a ""U-shaped"" happiness curve that seems to afflict people across the globe. (The low point in the U.S. is the mid-40s.) However, almost inevitably you become cheerier in your 50s and continue to grow happier through your 70s. Why? One theory is people reconcile themselves to the fact that they will not be CEO or a Supreme Court justice and begin to appreciate their lives  and the people in their lives. Also, brain studies show that your brain simply becomes happier after 50, as it ignores unhappy news and focuses on the positive.

3. My brain is becoming mush. Yes, you forget the name of your colleague. Yes, you can't remember that telephone number long enough to dial it. But actually, your brain is operating at its peak at midlife. Your processing speed and your ""fluid intelligence""  the ability to solve novel problems  begin decreasing in your late 20s. But your ""crystallized intelligence""  your knowledge, expertise, wisdom, your ability to navigate your workplace and personal life  continue to grow into your 70s. So, if you're given a choice between a 30-year-old surgeon and a 50-year-old, pick the middle-aged doctor. He may not be fast, but he's smart and experienced.

4. My body is going to seed. You may feel as if your only remaining athletic ability is pressing the remote or slumping into your chair at the office. Nothing could be further from the truth. Studies show that while there is some drop in muscle mass as you age, you can slow those changes to a crawl by getting your heart rate up a few times a week. For example, some of the athletes in the National Senior Games (for people 50 and older) swim college-level times. Moreover, exercise is almost an elixir for an aging brain. Studies have found that walking three times a week increased the area of the brain associated with memory  and turned back the brain clock by at least a year.

5. My marriage is boring and headed for the shoals of divorce. Now, this is a real danger: People in middle age divorce so often that the phenomenon has a moniker, the Gray Divorce Revolution. However, studies show that many couples are as passionately in love at their silver anniversary as they were at their first. There are several secrets to escaping the marriage slump, but here are three:

Add novelty to your routine. Go dancing or rent an RV.

Try to think as a team. Studies show that those who do so are happier and less likely to get divorced after 20 years, compared with those who think in terms of ""I"" or ""me.""

Focus on building trust, so that your partner becomes your safe harbor, not a source of threat. Studies show you may not only save your marriage but also change your brain.

Editor's note: Last fall, NPR's Maanvi Singh embarked on a months-long quest to find her ideal pumpkin pie recipe. As she discovered, there's a lot of science involved in getting the crust and filling just the way you like it. To celebrate Pi Day, we reprise this story, first published last December.

It was the best of pies, it was the worst of pies. I have baked many, many, many pies.

And when I first began making pumpkin pies this autumn, my results were at best inconsistent and, at worst, disastrous.

""One of the problems is most people make it once, maybe twice a year, right around the holidays, so they're not very practiced at it,"" says Dan Souza at America's Test Kitchen. ""And pumpkin pie is a little bit different in that it's essentially a custard baked into a pie shell."" In trying to juggle both components, even experienced bakers may end up with a grainy, overcooked filling or a soggy crust, Souza says. ""There's a lot of places you can slip up.""

So Souza and J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, a chef and author of The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science, coached me through the process.

The Ultimate Custard

""Mainly it's the texture that can go very wrong,"" Lopez-Alt says. ""It can end up grainy, or kind of broken up like scrambled eggs.""

Blergh.

See, a classic pumpkin pie filling includes a few eggs, as well as pumpkin puree, some cream, sugar and spice.

""As the custard cooks, there's a loose network of the egg proteins that intertwine with each other and set to give the filling structure,"" Lopez-Alt explains. Ideally, you want to cook the custard just enough to form a soft, gel-like texture. ""But as the custard keeps cooking, the eggs start to set so tightly that they squeeze moisture out,"" he says. That's when you get an icky, lumpy pie.

Both Lopez-Alt and Souza recommend cooking the filling quickly, but gently: The center of the pie should never get any hotter than about 175 degrees Fahrenheit.

And you've got to try to cook the pie as evenly as possible. Some cracking at the center of the pie is inevitable, Lopez-Alt says. It happens because the edges of the pie tend to cook and set faster, and pull at the center, which takes longer to cook.

Souza's pro tip is to bake the pie at about 400 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes, until the filling just starts to set, and then lower the oven temperature to about 300 degrees until it cooks through. ""By lowering the overall temperature, you get less of a disparity between temperature at the perimeter of the pie, and the temperature at the center,"" he says. He also recommends heating the filling on the stove for a bit, so it has to spend even less time cooking unevenly inside the oven.

Oh, and padding the custard with lots of fat helps as well. Souza's recipe calls for three eggs plus two egg yolks. ""By ditching some of the egg whites, you're reducing some of the water content, so the filling takes less time to firm up,"" he explains. ""And the fat in the egg yolks also serves as a buffer to keep the proteins from over cooking.""

Lopez-Alt suggests substituting the cream in the filling with cream cheese for a similar reason: It helps the custard cook more evenly for a smooth, creamy end result.

Brilliant.

The Ideal Crust

Over the past few months, I tried nearly everything to avoid ending up with soggy, mushy pie crusts. I pre-baked and crisped up my crusts before pouring in the filling. I tried brushing the bottom of my crust with some egg wash  to waterproof it. I pleaded with the culinary gods and complained to my friends and cried to my mother.

All of this, to no avail.

i toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR

And then Lopez-Alt suggested something wacky and wonderful: vodka. Not to drink (though a shot or two have served to console me after a culinary disaster). Lopez-Alt suggests substituting some of the water used to pull the pie dough together with a tablespoon or two of vodka. ""When you mix flour with water, it produces gluten,"" he explains. ""And gluten is what makes your pie dough tough rather than flaky.""

But gluten doesn't form in the presence of alcohol. ""Plus the vodka evaporates a bit more quickly when you bake the crust, so you're less likely to end up with a soggy crust,"" Lopez-Alt says.

He also suggests blending flour and butter together in the food processor. ""That way you need to add barely any water at the end to bring the dough together,"" he says. ""But the dough is still very soft, and easy to roll out.""

Pre-bake the crust until it's golden brown, and then, Souza says, fill it with a custard that you've already heated and thickened up a bit on the stove. ""That way,"" he says, ""the filling is less likely to seep and soak through the crust, and ruin that buttery, flaky goodness.""

The Richest Flavors

Canned or fresh squash?

The experts agree it doesn't really matter.

If you are using the fresh stuff, Lopez-Alt recommends roasting it very slowly in the oven  at around 275 degrees Fahrenheit. ""Pumpkins and squashes have these enzymes that will break down some of their starches and convert them to sugar,"" he says. ""Cooking them slowly can actually accelerate that process."" Slow-roasting also allows for more water to evaporate from the squash, concentrating its flavor.

And feel free to experiment with different squashes. Sugar pie pumpkins are classic, but butternut and kabocha squash can often taste sweeter and more ""pumpkin-y"" than the traditional orange gourds. ""Just never use one of those Jack-O-Lantern pumpkins,"" Lopez-Alt warns. ""Those are meant to look pretty, but they taste nasty.""

But Souza says people can rarely taste the difference: ""I think you may as well save yourself the effort and use a can.""

Of course, a judicious sprinkle of spices, some maple syrup and even a bit of sweet potato can deepen and enhance the flavor.

The Taste Tests

My journey to learn the art and science of the ideal pie has been long. Very, very long. I've baked a total of 10 pies over the past three months. I wanted to perfect my pie by Thanksgiving  but that didn't happen. Instead, I berated my Thanksgiving guests: ""You're saying it's good, but what does that even mean? Be more constructive with your criticism!""

i toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR

I faced many setbacks: I badly burned a couple of crusts. And, despite all the coaching, I curdled some custard. Take note, folks: Timers and thermometers are key.

But finally, in mid-December, I brought in two pies that combined all that I had learned to face my toughest critics yet: NPR's Science Desk.

For one pie, I used freshly roasted squash and cream cheese. I made the other with canned pumpkin. One of the crusts had some shortening, whereas the other was pure butter. And I used a good shot of vodka in both, of course.

Each pie had its fans.

My editor, Maria Godoy*, liked the cream cheese. ""It's like creamy pumpkin... Like, if pumpkin were milk.""

NPR Skunk Bear's Adam Cole disagreed: ""Not my cup of tea."" He liked the canned pumpkin better. [*Editor's note: Adam has an admitted preference for bland food.]

Photo editor Ryan Kellman said he was divided, insisting ""I need to probably to eat a lot more of this"" in order to decide.

And science correspondent Geoff Brumfield was no help at all: ""I mean, I'm just here to eat some pie.""

I'm still not satisfied. A bit more ginger may have given the pies more kick. The cream cheese filling didn't taste pumpkin-y enough, and the other one tasted perhaps too pumpkin-y. Maybe I should have baked the crusts a bit longer. Maybe I should have cooked the custard a bit less.

True perfection  and success  remain just beyond reach. Guess I'll have to pie, pie again.",[]

When a Donald Trump rally was cancelled in Chicago on Friday night after violent clashes broke out between protesters and Trump supporters, it set the tone for the next few days on the campaign trail.

More than a thousand people were lined up outside a Trump Rally in Cleveland, Ohio, on Saturday. They were buzzing about the events of the night before in Chicago and more that ready to show their support for Donald Trump.

Many in this crowd said they were angered by the protests aimed at disrupting Trump.

For Scott Brown, a 41-year-old landscaper from Canton, the issue was that liberals think free speech only applies to them.

""This is a double standard between liberals and conservatives,"" Brown said. ""You know the liberals can't you know, they don't like the truth.""

With more interruptions at events over the weekend, sometimes Trump engaged the protesters verbally. His supporters would also, always shouting them down.

But Brown predicted it will only have one lasting impact on Trumps campaign: ""It's gonna make us stronger, you know?""

Meanwhile, Trump says he bears no responsibility for the sometimes ominous atmosphere at his events.

At a John Kasich for President event Sunday in Strongsville, Ohio, there was a different take on the disruptions, which recently included a Trump supporter punching a protester in the face as the protester was being escorted out by police.

Brian Blowes, a human resources manager in Strongsville said of Trump, ""I think he instigates some of those things.""

Blowes, who said he'll vote for Kasich tomorrow, predicted that the Trump rallies will calm down, and so will the candidate as he gets closer to the GOP nomination and looks to broaden his appeal.

Also at the Kasich event was 52-year-old book editor Amy Nolan, who described herself as a newly-registered Republican.

As for the Trump campaign, her assessment was not kind. ""It's deplorable and laughable, of course, and there's great entertainment value, but it's also pretty dangerous, I think,"" Nolan said.

""If Trump has engendered this much unrest just in his candidacy, I fear what tumult will be engendered in a Trump presidency,"" she added.

But seated nearby by at the Kasich event was an undecided voter who said he's trying to choose between Kasich and Trump.

Rob Jarowski is a 31-year-old bank analyst who also attended the Saturday Trump rally in Cleveland. At that event there were a half dozen interruptions by protestors and one brief scuffle in the crowd. Jarowski used a heated local football rivalry as comparison.

""I'm a Cleveland Browns fan. I've been to Browns-[Pittsburgh] Steelers games. So I would say that rally was more tame than a Browns-Steelers game,"" Jarowski said.

Asked whether a political rally should be more tame than what can happen even the stands at a Browns-Steelers game, he laughed.

""The tone of the country is changing a little bit. We are frustrated with the status quo. So, I mean, if we get some excitement around our political events, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing,"" Jarowski said.

But on that point, there's plenty of disagreement.",[]

Oncologist Theodora Ross discusses the hereditary nature of cancer and her own predisposition to breast and ovarian cancer, which led her to have a double mastectomy and to have her ovaries removed.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. If you have a history of cancer in your family, you may be wondering if you should get a genetic test to see if you have any genetic mutations that might predispose you to cancer. My guest has had a lot of experience with that issue, professionally and personally. Dr. Theodora Ross directs the Cancer Genetics Program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. She is an oncologist who specializes in treating breast cancer, and she directs a research lab focusing on how cancer genes turn normal cells into cancer cells.

In spite of her knowledge and in spite of the history of cancer in her family including her uncle, father, mother, brother and sister, she didn't get tested until she was diagnosed with a melanoma. The melanoma was successfully treated but it scared her into wanting to know if she had the so-called breast cancer gene. After getting tested, she found out she had that gene. We'll hear what she did in response a little later. Dr. Ross has written a book that's part memoir, part medical science, called, ""A Cancer In The Family.""

Dr. Theodora Ross, welcome to FRESH AIR. So I have never gotten a kind of genetic testing that you've gotten, so I do not know if I'm genetically predisposed to cancer. I'm not sure I want to know. For me it, a little bit of self-deception is probably - (laughter), is maybe a healthy thing. You're an advocate of testing. You direct a cancer genetics program yet you put off getting tested yourself for years in spite of a history of cancer in your family. So why did you put it off for so long?

THEODORA ROSS: I was around the edges of trying to understand my own family's history of cancer. We were in a study by a research institution. I talked to a genetic counselor and asked them if they knew anything. And, it's interesting, they said it was not clearly hereditary in our family, but I changed the words around and told my fiance at the time that it was clearly not hereditary, and we went ahead and got married. But within the first year of getting married, I came down with melanoma, and at that point, I think, was when that denial went away.

And I decided to talk to another friend who was a genetics expert at The Ohio State University, and they evaluated me. I got tested. And I can just say it really changed how I saw things. So I went from this state of constant uncertainty and not knowing to knowing, and it was exhilarating. It was...

GROSS: Exhilarating? Scary is a word that comes to mind for me. (Laughter).

ROSS: It was exhilarating because all of a sudden, we discovered we had a particular mutation, a BRCA1 mutation, going throughout our family that certainly was a contributor to my sister's death and...

GROSS: Your sister died of breast cancer.

ROSS: Breast cancer, yes. In her 30s.

GROSS: So you mentioned you were diagnosed with melanoma before getting genetically tested. That was treated surgically and that...

ROSS: Exactly, it was tiny melanoma. (Laughter).

GROSS: OK so you were done with that, but then you got tested, found out that you tested positive for the so-called breast cancer gene, which also left you predisposed to ovarian cancer. So after getting this information and thinking it through, you decided to have a double mastectomy and to have both of your ovaries removed. How did you reach that decision?

ROSS: Well, once I figured out I had the mutation, it was pretty clear because I think I'd been thinking about it for years. You know, being a doctor, being an oncologist, seeing the data, I'd been thinking about it. So I was already prepared, plus I'd seen my sister go through this and other people in the family go through these things. And so for me, it was an instant decision - I don't want to get that, I don't want to go through that, and the data is really good for that preventing cancer. So it was a pretty quick decision for me. Many patients, it's not. It takes them some time.

GROSS: So you had the surgery done. How long ago was that?

ROSS: That was in 2004. So 12 years ago.

GROSS: So how effective was getting the double mastectomy and the - getting your ovaries removed? How effective was that in diminishing your fear of getting cancer?

ROSS: A hundred percent. (Laughter). I mean, I - of course, I could have a relapse or I could get a new melanoma, if that's caused by this BRCA mutation. I could have cancer, yes. But the reality is, is I probably have a lower risk of breast cancer and ovarian cancer than the general population.

GROSS: So you tried to understand the source of your genetic predisposition to cancer. Your father and your mother had cancer. One of your uncles had cancer. Your sister died of cancer. Your brother had cancer. So - but you were assuming that since Ashkenazi Jews are especially prone to have this genetic predisposition, and since your father is Jewish and your mother not, you assumed that this gene came from your father's side of the family. But in doing your genetic research, you learned something very interesting about your mother's family. What did you learn?

ROSS: Well, yes, it was really quite shocking. So, you know, Mother's always right, as they say. So when we discovered that I had the mutation, we went to visit her. We had Sunday dinner with her and we were talking to her about it and telling her that this came from her late husband's side of the family, certainly, since he was a Jew.

And she said, no, that's not the case. And we said, no, it is the case. And she also didn't get the idea that my brothers each had a 50 percent chance of having this mutation. They hadn't been tested at that time, it was so early in this discovery. And as we were talking, it became clear that as part of this research study we were in, she had received a letter when my father was dying.

He was in hospice and so she kind of filed it away - but, a letter from them saying, we have new information for you. And when I got all the records from them and I'm reading through it, I find that they'd never tested my father. They'd tested my mom, and she was the one -the Polish Catholic - that carried his supposed Ashkenazi Jewish mutation.

GROSS: So what responsibility did you feel to the rest of your family when you found out that you had this gene? 'Cause if it runs in the family, do you have a responsibility to tell, like, you know, nieces and nephews and uncles and aunts and cousins? And, say they don't want to know?

ROSS: Yes, once you find out you've found a mutation, there is a responsibility to inform as many relatives as you can because you can save their life. When I first got the mutation information, I called my uncle - my dad's brother - because remember, he's Jewish and so we thought that's where the mutation was. And he's a psychiatrist and understands medicine.

And he, right away, even though he's Jewish and ultimately we would've found out it hadn't come from his family, he still tested to make sure because he's got four daughters and a son. And he turned it out to be negative, which was really great for them. My mother's side of the family, it's more difficult. We don't know people like my father's side of the family, and one of the hopefully exciting parts of this book will be that they'll read it and they'll find out they have a mutation and save their life.

GROSS: So you are a strong advocate of genetic testing, but not everybody needs to get tested? Like, who should get tested?

ROSS: I think it should start out with looking at your family. And a family history is so important, so hard to get. It's a noble cause to try to get an accurate family history. You'd be surprised how inaccurate our family histories are, including my own. I don't know if my aunt had ovarian cancer, or was it endometrial cancer? Everybody goes back and forth on that, and the records don't exist. But getting that family history is the first step before testing.

And if you find your family history has a strong, you know, component of cancer in it or of some other disease - heart disease or a neurologic disease - seeing a genetic specialist and flushing that out, they help you. They go through each step, they tell you what the issues are and whether or not you're really looking at this right. So it's an objective view. And then they can help you determine whether or not there's a specific gene or set of genes to figure out whether there is a genetic predisposition to your disease, cancer or otherwise.

GROSS: Why do you need to know this before getting tested? I mean, why can't you just give a sample and say, tell me what mutations I have?

ROSS: It's tough because we have 20,000 genes in our genome. We have lots of interspersed sequences. We have a very complex genome. So just sequencing your genome won't help you very much. If you're Ashkenazi Jewish then it is a reasonable thing to consider getting tested for the mutations with that heritage. So there are three BRCA mutations - BRCA1, two of them, and BRCA2, one of them - that are at a high enough frequency in the Ashkenazi Jewish population that screening for those is a reasonable thing. I think it's 1 in 40.

And so those are reasonable getting without any family history - you're Ashkenazi Jewish, I'd test for those three. But in general, just testing people is kind of a random process and so the family history will tell you. And in addition to that, if your family history is, you know, very - there are lots of cancers - like, for example, Angelina Jolie had a BRCA1 mutation, and she had a very strong family history. With that, her risk is higher than somebody who has the same mutation but doesn't have a family history but has a large number of females in it. It's not just the mutation that contributes to the risk, it's also the amount of cancer in the family and how early those cancers occurred.

GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Dr. Theodora Ross. Her new book is called, ""A Cancer In The Family: Take Control Of Your Genetic Inheritance."" She leads the Cancer Genetics Program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and she leads a lab that investigates how cells transform from normal cells to cancer cells. Let's take a short break then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. And if you're just joining us, my guest is Dr. Theodora Ross. She's the author of a new book ""A Cancer In The Family: Take Control Of Your Genetic Inheritance."" And she leads the cancer genetics program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. She also leads a lab that investigates how cells transform from normal cells to cancer cells.

And she tests positive for the gene that predisposes people to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. She had a double mastectomy and had her ovaries removed in around 2004 when she found this out. So do you give people any advice about how to make the decision if they do test positive for the breast cancer gene, how to decide whether to have a mastectomy or not?

ROSS: Yes. I mean, you really - it's so individual. And luckily, we have genetic counselors who can help, you know, with the daily process of going through that. It takes more than, you know, just oh, I have the information and therefore I'm going to have the surgeries or I'm going to be followed and try to catch an early cancer. You know, it takes some time.

And if a person doesn't have cancer when they find out they have the mutation, there's no rush. So that's the first thing, you know, take your time. But in the end, the reality is that if you have these surgeries, you prevent cancer. This is one of those cancers - situations - it's like smoking. If you stop smoking or you don't smoke, the chances are you won't get lung cancer. If you have prophylactic surgeries, the chances are you won't get breast cancer or you won't get ovarian cancer - pretty good chances. I mean, there's a very slight chance that you will, but you've reduced it by 95 to 99 percent.

GROSS: Say you get tested and you're positive for the gene, but you don't want to get a mastectomy. Is this going to be on your health records? Will employers ever know about this and decide not to hire you because you're predisposed to cancer? Will your health insurance rates go up? What are some of the outcomes as information ripples out into the world, if it does?

ROSS: Well, there is the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act that was passed in 2008, which does in some cases prevent such discrimination. So, for example, if you're - work for an employer that has more than 15 employees, they can't discriminate if they find out that you have a mutation, a genetic defect that may affect your health. In this case, If you have the surgeries, however - and life insurances are starting to catch on to this - is if you do this, it's sort of like not smoking. All of a sudden, you're a good bet for them. And they're starting to catch that.

So life insurance is also something that you probably want to get before you find out if you have a mutation. But I've talked to people who are insurance agents for life insurance companies, and they're starting to advocate for it and for action, which is remarkable. But in terms of the Nondiscrimination Act, it was a big deal for genetics so that you can get tested. And in terms of insurance companies - health insurance - you cannot be discriminated against.

It does get into your record now. It used to be we had these shadow records where we didn't put them into the real record. And that was a real problem because then we lost all these people who had mutations and we weren't able to have an accurate medical history on these patients. So now it's in the record, it's good. And in terms of discrimination, I feel it's becoming a historical fact.

GROSS: One of the things you write about in your book is how there's a lot of secrecy surrounding cancer. You write about the difference between secrecy and privacy. Privacy came up for you when you found out that you were positive for the cancer gene, the breast cancer gene. And your husband - who works in a lab that shares a building with a lab that you had - he sent out to what I think is a really interesting email to his fellow workers in that lab. And I just want to read an excerpt of it.

It starts with you may have noticed I've been unusually busy and stressed lately, and I thought it important to share with you some personal information. And he goes on to tell them that you were diagnosed with melanoma in the fall, you had surgery. It was caught early. But as a result of that and cancer in your family, you got the genetic test, which came back positive.

So he writes (reading) the medical issues are complex and distressing. As as a result, Theo and I are quite preoccupied as we work to resolve them. I'm sure that you can understand that this is personal and know that you will respect our privacy by keeping this information confidential. I realize that you may be concerned, but please don't ask for updates or additional information from me or Theo as we're trying to figure this stuff out ourselves. I thought that was really an interesting - I understood the explanations and him asking for, you know, his colleagues to respect your privacy. And I was kind of surprised when he said don't ask for updates or additional information. Can you talk more about that request and why it was important to you both?

ROSS: You know, we really wanted to do the right thing. We wanted to get the right surgeons. We wanted to tell all the family members. We wanted everybody who needed the information to have the information. It was complicated, you know, just trying to figure out where to do things, how to get them done, how to keep our jobs going, how to keep our family happy. And to have distractions of other people, that was a big issue is just to keep it simple and keep go forward and get it done.

GROSS: Now, if I understand correctly, all cancers are caused by genetic mutations but only some of those mutations are genetically passed on...

ROSS: Right.

GROSS: ...Within families.

ROSS: That's right.

GROSS: So what percentage of cancers are genetically passed on?

ROSS: People say 10 percent of cancers have an inherited component that we know of. There was a recent study - it was called the Nortrac (ph) study in Norway and other countries in that area. They looked at identical twins versus fraternal twins and looked at their cancer incidents.

So if you looked at an identical twin and it had cancer and then its other twin had cancer, how frequent was that compared to the fraternal, where they're not identical genetically? And from that, they did a lot of mathematical gimcrackery, something like that, discovered that 33 percent of the common cancers have a genetic component, meaning an inherited component that contributes to their cancer.

GROSS: That's pretty high. And what happens to the genes when it's not an inherited issue? Like, if the genes are still causing cancer, what do we know about how they're transformed during the course of a person's life?

ROSS: Well, the genes that are important in causing cancer - in that, we call it the sporadic situation. It's like you have a blueprint. Your blueprint is what you inherit. And then on the blueprint, there's a renovation, and it's a malignant renovation. And the malignant renovation is these other genes - oncogenes are formed, translocations are formed where a gene becomes too active. And it can cause the cell to proliferate and proliferate and proliferate. And more mutations occur as it proliferates liberates.

Every time a cell divides, it has to copy its DNA. And every time it copies its DNA, there's a mistake here or there. And sometimes that mistake's not fixed. And so we get more and more mutations. And when you get mutations and genes that prevent the cell from dying, so it just keeps surviving, causes it to invade organs, causes it to survive in an organ it shouldn't survive in, that's when you get cancer. And those are sporadic mutations added on to your blueprint.

GROSS: If you're having a preemptive double mastectomy to preventer yourself from getting breast cancer, you're exposing yourself to a lot of risk. That's a pretty major surgery. Convince me that it's really worth the risk when you don't know what the odds are for sure that you would get breast cancer, but you do know for sure if you have the double mastectomy or exposing yourself to the risk of infection to, like, if you want reconstructive surgery, you're exposing yourself to the risk of several surgeries. It's going to take a toll on your body. You know for certain that that's going to happen.

ROSS: Yes, you do. But a mastectomy - you know, bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction puts you at some risk for, like you said, infections and side effects and issues. But if you have a 50 to 80 percent chance of getting a breast cancer that's going to kill you, weighing at the pros and cons there, I think the mastectomy is the way to go because then you prevent that. You go from, you know, a 50 to 80-percent chance down to maybe a 5 percent chance if some cells are left over. And you have a nice long life. You know, if you do the math, it's not so bad.

I have to say, you know, mastectomies are not a big surgery. The oophorectomy is a little bit more complicated because you're taking out the ovaries and you have all of a sudden instant menopause. And there are issues with that - you know, bone density issues, you know, health issues as well as quality-of-life issues, hot flashes, those kind of things. But still, it's a lot better than the alternative, the alternative of dying in your 40s or 50s.

GROSS: That's an alternative you witnessed with your sister.

ROSS: Yeah. Yes, with my sister and many patients who've had these mutations.

GROSS: Well, Dr. Ross, thank you so much for talking with us.

ROSS: Thank you.

GROSS: Dr. Theodora Ross directs the cancer genetics program at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. She's the author of the new book ""A Cancer In The Family.""

Nash has a voice that resonates and cuts to the core. When he played the title track from his forthcoming solo album This Path Tonight, I was moved by the clarity and quality of his tone. His lucid songwriting displays the deep introspection that comes with age; he's 74 and as insightful as ever. Along with guitarist Shane Fontayne, Nash played music that felt memorable, touching and as thoughtful as anything he made during his time with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.

i toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR

Editor's note: Last fall, NPR's Maanvi Singh embarked on a months-long quest to find her ideal pumpkin pie recipe. As she discovered, there's a lot of science involved in getting the crust and filling just the way you like it. To celebrate Pi Day, we reprise this story, first published last December.

It was the best of pies, it was the worst of pies. I have baked many, many, many pies.

And when I first began making pumpkin pies this autumn, my results were at best inconsistent and, at worst, disastrous.

""One of the problems is most people make it once, maybe twice a year, right around the holidays, so they're not very practiced at it,"" says Dan Souza at America's Test Kitchen. ""And pumpkin pie is a little bit different in that it's essentially a custard baked into a pie shell."" In trying to juggle both components, even experienced bakers may end up with a grainy, overcooked filling or a soggy crust, Souza says. ""There's a lot of places you can slip up.""

So Souza and J. Kenji Lopez-Alt, a chef and author of The Food Lab: Better Home Cooking Through Science, coached me through the process.

The Ultimate Custard

""Mainly it's the texture that can go very wrong,"" Lopez-Alt says. ""It can end up grainy, or kind of broken up like scrambled eggs.""

Blergh.

See, a classic pumpkin pie filling includes a few eggs, as well as pumpkin puree, some cream, sugar and spice.

""As the custard cooks, there's a loose network of the egg proteins that intertwine with each other and set to give the filling structure,"" Lopez-Alt explains. Ideally, you want to cook the custard just enough to form a soft, gel-like texture. ""But as the custard keeps cooking, the eggs start to set so tightly that they squeeze moisture out,"" he says. That's when you get an icky, lumpy pie.

Both Lopez-Alt and Souza recommend cooking the filling quickly, but gently: The center of the pie should never get any hotter than about 175 degrees Fahrenheit.

And you've got to try to cook the pie as evenly as possible. Some cracking at the center of the pie is inevitable, Lopez-Alt says. It happens because the edges of the pie tend to cook and set faster, and pull at the center, which takes longer to cook.

Souza's pro tip is to bake the pie at about 400 degrees Fahrenheit for about 10 minutes, until the filling just starts to set, and then lower the oven temperature to about 300 degrees until it cooks through. ""By lowering the overall temperature, you get less of a disparity between temperature at the perimeter of the pie, and the temperature at the center,"" he says. He also recommends heating the filling on the stove for a bit, so it has to spend even less time cooking unevenly inside the oven.

Oh, and padding the custard with lots of fat helps as well. Souza's recipe calls for three eggs plus two egg yolks. ""By ditching some of the egg whites, you're reducing some of the water content, so the filling takes less time to firm up,"" he explains. ""And the fat in the egg yolks also serves as a buffer to keep the proteins from over cooking.""

Lopez-Alt suggests substituting the cream in the filling with cream cheese for a similar reason: It helps the custard cook more evenly for a smooth, creamy end result.

Brilliant.

The Ideal Crust

Over the past few months, I tried nearly everything to avoid ending up with soggy, mushy pie crusts. I pre-baked and crisped up my crusts before pouring in the filling. I tried brushing the bottom of my crust with some egg wash  to waterproof it. I pleaded with the culinary gods and complained to my friends and cried to my mother.

All of this, to no avail.

i toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR

And then Lopez-Alt suggested something wacky and wonderful: vodka. Not to drink (though a shot or two have served to console me after a culinary disaster). Lopez-Alt suggests substituting some of the water used to pull the pie dough together with a tablespoon or two of vodka. ""When you mix flour with water, it produces gluten,"" he explains. ""And gluten is what makes your pie dough tough rather than flaky.""

But gluten doesn't form in the presence of alcohol. ""Plus the vodka evaporates a bit more quickly when you bake the crust, so you're less likely to end up with a soggy crust,"" Lopez-Alt says.

He also suggests blending flour and butter together in the food processor. ""That way you need to add barely any water at the end to bring the dough together,"" he says. ""But the dough is still very soft, and easy to roll out.""

Pre-bake the crust until it's golden brown, and then, Souza says, fill it with a custard that you've already heated and thickened up a bit on the stove. ""That way,"" he says, ""the filling is less likely to seep and soak through the crust, and ruin that buttery, flaky goodness.""

The Richest Flavors

Canned or fresh squash?

The experts agree it doesn't really matter.

If you are using the fresh stuff, Lopez-Alt recommends roasting it very slowly in the oven  at around 275 degrees Fahrenheit. ""Pumpkins and squashes have these enzymes that will break down some of their starches and convert them to sugar,"" he says. ""Cooking them slowly can actually accelerate that process."" Slow-roasting also allows for more water to evaporate from the squash, concentrating its flavor.

And feel free to experiment with different squashes. Sugar pie pumpkins are classic, but butternut and kabocha squash can often taste sweeter and more ""pumpkin-y"" than the traditional orange gourds. ""Just never use one of those Jack-O-Lantern pumpkins,"" Lopez-Alt warns. ""Those are meant to look pretty, but they taste nasty.""

But Souza says people can rarely taste the difference: ""I think you may as well save yourself the effort and use a can.""

Of course, a judicious sprinkle of spices, some maple syrup and even a bit of sweet potato can deepen and enhance the flavor.

The Taste Tests

My journey to learn the art and science of the ideal pie has been long. Very, very long. I've baked a total of 10 pies over the past three months. I wanted to perfect my pie by Thanksgiving  but that didn't happen. Instead, I berated my Thanksgiving guests: ""You're saying it's good, but what does that even mean? Be more constructive with your criticism!""

i toggle caption Meredith Rizzo/NPR Meredith Rizzo/NPR

I faced many setbacks: I badly burned a couple of crusts. And, despite all the coaching, I curdled some custard. Take note, folks: Timers and thermometers are key.

But finally, in mid-December, I brought in two pies that combined all that I had learned to face my toughest critics yet: NPR's Science Desk.

For one pie, I used freshly roasted squash and cream cheese. I made the other with canned pumpkin. One of the crusts had some shortening, whereas the other was pure butter. And I used a good shot of vodka in both, of course.

Each pie had its fans.

My editor, Maria Godoy*, liked the cream cheese. ""It's like creamy pumpkin... Like, if pumpkin were milk.""

NPR Skunk Bear's Adam Cole disagreed: ""Not my cup of tea."" He liked the canned pumpkin better. [*Editor's note: Adam has an admitted preference for bland food.]

Photo editor Ryan Kellman said he was divided, insisting ""I need to probably to eat a lot more of this"" in order to decide.

And science correspondent Geoff Brumfield was no help at all: ""I mean, I'm just here to eat some pie.""

I'm still not satisfied. A bit more ginger may have given the pies more kick. The cream cheese filling didn't taste pumpkin-y enough, and the other one tasted perhaps too pumpkin-y. Maybe I should have baked the crusts a bit longer. Maybe I should have cooked the custard a bit less.

True perfection  and success  remain just beyond reach. Guess I'll have to pie, pie again.",[]

The surging voices of two female lead singers create the signature sound of the five-piece band Lucius. Rock critic Ken Tucker says the band's new album, Good Grief, is often lovely and well-crafted.

TERRY GROSS, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross.

In a relatively short time, the band Lucius has attracted a wide, diverse following that includes the Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman, who's blogged about the group. Lucius is a five-piece Brooklyn-based band whose signature sound is the voices of its two female lead singers. Our rock critic Ken Tucker has a review of the new Lucius album ""Good Grief.""

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BETTER LOOK BACK"")

LUCIUS: (Singing) We'll say it perfectly, and it slips right through the cracks. They'll mince our words down to a nugget for the masses. And they'll push it down the conveyor belt once more, more. Something for everyone, something that's so different from before, before.

KEN TUCKER, BYLINE: The first thing you probably notice about Lucius is its lead vocals. Singers Jess Wolfe and Holly Laessig sing in unison as frequently as in harmony, creating an urgency and emphasis on whatever idea, emotion or thought the band is trying to get across. Sometimes, that goal is simply to convey what it's like to feel like a kid again, as they do on a quick, peppery ode to adolescence called ""Born Again Teen.""

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""BORN AGAIN TEEN"")

LUCIUS: (Singing) It's a feeling, like a born-again teen. Got a heartbeat like we're only 16. Would you take my hand, baby? You know you know I like to dance. Maybe we'll be good. We can be good, you and I. You can follow me, or if you want to take a leap, you know it's obvious we're naturally aligned. It's a feeling like...

TUCKER: Wolfe and Laessig met as students at the Berklee College of Music and formed Lucius, moving to Brooklyn. The music is a magpie mix of styles and pop music periods - '60s girl group, '70s disco, '80s electropop - with the occasional florid ballad that would not sound out of place emerging from the throat of a contestant on ""American Idol"" or ""The Voice."" In other words, Lucius's music could have been excessive and derivative. But on the strength of tightly-stitched melodies, an occasionally striking image and those surging voices, it is more often lovely, well-crafted stuff.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""MY HEART GOT CAUGHT ON YOUR SLEEVE"")

LUCIUS: (Singing) Don't know how to start this. No, I don't know what to say. They seemed to fall out of the sky. Lost and found is all the same. Trying to think of my heart as an ocean where there's room enough for things to come up to the top. I'm counting on it sinking down again. Oh, oh, my heart got caught on your sleeve. I need it. Please give it back to me. My heart got caught on your sleeve. Please give it back to me. Please give it back to me.

TUCKER: One could point out that there's a certain sameness to Lucius's subject material, which tends towards the post-breakup, why-did-we-treat-each-other-so-badly mood. But I frankly don't much care about the meanings of the words when there's so much being communicated in the music and the tone of the vocals.

Listen to this song, ""What We Have To Change."" It's built around a chorus that would not be out of place in a gospel context or forming the architecture of a soul music single. It features Wolfe and Laessig singing as one as they climb a mountain - a mountain of melody, a mountain of romantic challenges - carrying the implication that there ain't no mountain high enough to keep them from getting to you.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""WHAT WE HAVE TO CHANGE"")

LUCIUS: (Singing) Don't want to talk to you today. Don't want to play the games you want to play. I love you, baby, but I just don't know what we have - what we have to do to change. Leaving you has crossed my mind. I'm afraid another heart is hard to find. I love you, baby, but I don't know why - why our love - why it's fallen so behind. Find me a mountain or any grand canyons. Just find us an igloo, and I'll freeze with you. I'll climb any tower, take any grand notion. Just find an ocean to swim into. Anyway, if we don't find a way, I'll have to get over you.

TUCKER: Lucius has attracted quite a range of fans. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has put aside his thoughts on the economy to write about his fan crush on Lucius more than once. And Lucius appeared onstage alongside Pink Floyd's Roger Waters at the 2015 Newport Folk Festival. The album ""Good Grief"" was co-produced by Bob Ezrin, who's produced famous albums for Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper. The songs frequently have a big sound. But they remain scaled to the proportions of the vocals. The result isn't a series of pretty showcases, but rather opportunities for them to blast past the instrumentation.

(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, ""ALMOST MAKES ME WISH FOR RAIN"")

LUCIUS: Here we are. Thought you'd have to rescue me. But thankfully, didn't get the best of me. It's not worth the fuss. It's not worth my time. I could lose it, but I'd be out of (unintelligible). So here we are on the side of the road, but the sun is out lightening my load. Just a flat tire and a helping hand - I could lose it, but it's just not so bad. Looking for...

TUCKER: I have emphasized the two vocalists in Lucius. They are very much the focal point of the group. The two women are credited with writing all the songs on this album, and they also tend to dress alike on stage. But Lucius is a band - a tight band and a very crafty group. The album title, ""Good Grief,"" has a certain literalness. Even when lamenting love lost, gone or destroyed, mourning over it can be healthy if done the Lucius way. Romantic grief can be powerful, renewing - good grief.

GROSS: Ken Tucker is critic-at-large for Yahoo TV. He reviewed ""Good Grief,"" the new album from the band Lucius. Coming up, the stars of the new Netflix comedy series ""Love,"" Paul Rust and Joe Gillian Jacobs. This is FRESH AIR.

Jezebel's Jia Tolentino has described the Maryland rapper's ""technical virtuosity,"" likening Perry to Kendrick Lamar and calling his best moments ""so directly vulnerable and commanding that they feel channeled.""

In the 10 months since, Perry has only gotten crisper. If you don't believe me, check out this clip from ""Rap God rmx,"" his take on the Eminem original:

Did you catch that? Neither did I, the first fifty times I listened, but that's just fine. It's one of those magical stretches that combines everything that makes good rap so fun to listen to: rhythm and rhyme, wordplay and style, storytelling and signifying, to borrow criteria from Adam Bradley's ""Book of Rhymes: The Poetics of Hip Hop.""

Perry's lyrics get serious, taking up issues like mental health, politics, history, and religion, but he's also a master of super goofy, intensely satisfying posturing. Try not to smile as you watch the video for ""Kaancepts,"" where he bops around in a Georgetown jersey spewing a series of math puns that culminate in ""I haven't even touched on the square roots of my averages, the 3.14 pi divided with savages."" Musically, he plays with a range of styles, rapping over Mozart's Lacrymosa in ""Work"" and sampling ""Hotel California"" in ""The Eagles.""

""If y equals mx plus me, then I must be an MC that's obscene!"" YouTube

His website talks about hip hop being a voice for the voiceless, so I asked Perry who he's trying to represent. ""There are a sect of kids that are not feeling trap rap and they're not feeling drinking cough syrup and getting high, popping a Xan and getting high,"" he says. ""I feel like there's a lot of introspective, artistic kids...So I kind of want to speak to those kids that have talents and abilities, [but] they're just too insecure and too self-conscious to actually act on those things.""

Take ""Antidope,"" a song about reinventing oneself. It's Perry's twist on Travis Scott's blow-up single ""Antidote."" Compare the opening lyrics of the original (""Don't you open up that window/Don't you let out that antidote/Poppin' pills is all we know/In the hills is all we know,"") to Perry's version: ""Lately I haven't been sleeping. I'm terrified that I'm falling off. I've been secluded, ashamed that I lost it. Forgiving myself is a daunting task. Now I'm revising the vision. Slow down the rhythm, it's easy to listen.""

I asked Perry what role racial identity plays in his music. ""I'm obviously a younger black man,"" he says, ""so that stuff is definitely in the back of my mind....All that stuff we're seeing nowadays with police brutality and racism and bigotry that we've always seen in this country, it's always in the back of your mind...I feel like if you're born black it's kind of like it comes with the territory. You've gotta know what's going on around you and what situations you're in. But in terms of me writing, I don't feel like I speak for anyone. I don't speak for young black men or black people. I speak for myself.""

In ""Real,"" Perry reflects about how some of those instances of racism and brutality affect his own mentality, as well as how he sees members of his community responding. He wraps up the last verse with this kicker: ""You act like this brutality has not happened for ages. There ain't no turning of pages, instead I'm setting the scene. Out in Texas they'll f murder you for traffic infractions, violating your civil liberties and all of your rights. If you don't understand the law then you could call it a night. Getting harassed and on your ass and then they taking your life. But this reality is feeling very nightmare-like. I said it's all the same thing from Sandra to Rodney King.""

Glint in the grass? Often, it's not even a nickel.

But last week, Israeli Laurie Rimon spotted a gleam while on a hike in northern Israel with several friends. It turned out to be a gold coin so unusual, Israeli archaeologists say there is only one other one with the same symbols in the world.

""It's extremely exciting,"" said Dr. Donald Ariel, an expert with the Israel Antiquities Authority, in comments released by the agency, which says the coin was struck by Roman Emperor Trajan in the year 107. ""His gold coins are extremely rare.""

One side of the gold disc shows an image of Augustus, the founder of the Roman Empire more than a century earlier. The other has symbols of Roman military legions.

i toggle caption Image provided by the Israel Antiquities Authority Image provided by the Israel Antiquities Authority

Israeli archaeologists believe Trajan made the coin to honor Augustus. Ariel says at that time gold coins were used only for high finance  and to pay soldiers when silver was unavailable.

But they were worth so much  one gold coin would cover a month of a soldier's salary, according to Ariel  that they were difficult to actually use.

""When the Romans didn't have, for some reason, their regular silver coins to pay soldiers, they would pay three coins every quarter to the soldiers instead of the regular 75 silver coins,"" Ariel said. ""But when the Roman soldier received this coin, what could he do with it? He couldn't buy anything in the market, in town. It was far too much money.""

Ariel says soldiers would have to beg the paymaster to change their gold into something spendable.

He speculates that the find  the only coin minted by Trajan found to this day in northern Israel  could give some clues to the Roman army presence in the Galilee area at that time. Jews and Roman rulers fought several wars between A.D. 66 and 135, including before Trajan's rule, when an ancient Jewish temple was destroyed in Jerusalem.

Antiquities officials said Rimon, the hiker who found the coin, told them it was ""not easy"" to part with her find. ""It's not every day one discovers such an amazing object,"" she told the agency representative who came to inspect and collect it.

The Israel Antiquities Authority plans to give her a certificate of appreciation for turning it over to authorities. They hope to display the coin publicly soon.",[]

Today is Pi Day, a time to celebrate the never-ending number that helps us calculate the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter.

Here in the U.S., Pi Day has officially become a ""thing""  for example, today at Whole Foods, you can get slices of pie for $3.14, and if you can solve math problems from a Princeton professor, Pizza Hut will give you 3.14 years' worth of free pizza.

The developing world, which we cover in this blog, loves its pi, too.

Suresh Kumar Sharma, a 21-year-old former vegetable vendor from Jaipur, India, is the current record holder on the Pi World Ranking List when it comes to reciting the digits of pi. In October 2015, he recited 70,030 numbers in 17 hours. To do it, he associated every number with an image. Now he helps coach others in their memorization skills.

The Guinness World Records, however, says the top pi reciter is Rajveer Meena from India who reeled off 70,000 digits in just 10 hours in 2015 while blindfolded.

(Meanwhile, a 69-year-old Japanese man says he's the unofficial record-holder, claiming he can recite about 111,700 digits.)

Here's a roundup of global pi facts, past and present.

An Egyptian scribe named Ahmes was one of the first to record the value of pi, around 1650 B.C. On the famous Rhind Papyrus, a collection of math problems, Ahmes wrote, ""Cut off 1/9 of a diameter and construct a square upon the remainder; this has the same area as the circle."" According to his calculation, pi equaled 3.16. That's just about 1 percent off the modern 3.14 number and closer than what the Chinese were using hundreds of years later: pi = 3.

Over time, global math gurus have made pi more accurate. In the year 480, the Chinese brought pi to six digits. In 1400, Indian scholars helped push it to 11 digits. Thanks to computers, we're up to 13.3 trillion digits today.

In India, a Sanskrit verse gives the value of pi up to 31 decimal places. Numbers are translated into alphabetical code  for example, ""ka"" represents 1, ""ra"" for 2, ""gha"" for 3 and so on  and strung together. The verse doubles as a hymn to Lord Krishna.

The top five spots in the Pi World Ranking List, a global list of people who can recite the most pi digits by heart, belong to India and China.

A couple of Namibian kids got special notice from the list in 2007 for reciting 30 decimal points ... while juggling three balls.

You can't find a more intimate relationship between humans, food, and nature than fishing, says Michele Mesmain, international coordinator of Slow Fish, a seafood spinoff of the Italy-based Slow Food movement. Think of all the thousands of boats at sea, catching wild creatures to haul back to shore and eat. ""It's our last source of widely eaten, truly wild food,"" she says.

Held every odd-numbered year in Genoa, Slow Fish attracts around 50,000 chefs, fishers, scholars, activists and eaters to promote small-scale fishing, marine biodiversity, cooking and eating neglected seafood species. This year, organizers added a U.S. event  in New Orleans  to highlight fisheries in the Americas and threats to Louisiana's vanishing independent fishermen.

The New Orleans event was born last year when New Orleans Slow Food chair Gary Granata and Carmo restaurateurs Dana and Christina Honn presented in Genoa. Granata says he spoke about Louisiana's coast washing away due to erosion, ""and Dana and Christina cooked Louisiana seafood in sauce piquant, and we said: 'Come to New Orleans!' ""

They meant it. To fund Slow Fish 2016, the group held ""Trash Fish Happy Hours,"" where customers could eat seafood  like porgy, small squid and whiting  that's normally considered unwanted bycatch. Though the New Orleans Slow Fish gathering came together as an ""all-volunteer, DIY sort of thing,"" Granata says, it was far from unambitious. Alongside panel discussions about fisheries throughout the Americas, the hosts planned a full-on festival with a lineup of live, local music, and chefs cooking Louisiana seafood, plus added delicacies from around North America.

Then the rain came.

Severe storm threats cancelled the festival side of things, and sent visiting chefs scrambling for what to do with the seafood they'd brought from hundreds of miles away.

""But that's what fishermen do every day, is improvise,"" said Chef Drew Deckman as he took cover in a makeshift kitchen under a tent, and shucked the first of about 200-dozen oysters from his home in Baja, Mexico. He mixed a salad of smoked river trout from California and chopped its crispy, grilled skin to lay on top.

""Fishermen can't predict conditions,"" Deckman says. ""It's an unfair and uneven playing field for them.""

Lance Nacio nodded as he stood in tall, white rubber shrimp boots and slurped an oyster from the half shell. Owner and captain of Anna Marie Shrimp out of Montegut, La., he designed his 55-foot boat to weather deep seas, yet not so big that the upfront cost of fuel might outweigh the value of his catch  an equation that's failed to add up for many local fishers.

Fishing boat captain Tim Rider out of Saco, Maine, says smaller fishers are literally going under. ""Just last night, a good friend of mine lost his boat. It sank off the coast of Hawaii."" Rider says that happens more often, as independent commercial fishermen are forced to test the limits of their smaller vessels further offshore, because closer waters are overfished.

Niaz Dorry of Glouchester, Mass., and the Northwest Atlantic Marine Alliance was especially eager to eat lots of Louisiana shrimp. ""I'm a big fan of shrimp, but I hardly ever eat it, because most of the shrimp we get are farmed, imported, pumped up with antibiotics and toxins  plus the destruction of the environment that goes along with that,"" she says. ""So I'm excited to be in a place where wild shrimp is still a viable product.""

It wasn't viable for Kevin Curole of Galliano, La., though. He says he sold his boat  named ""The Heavy Metal""  to send his daughter to college. ""I bled in that boat,"" he says  customizing it into his dream vessel. But with competition from aquaculture imports and the high price of diesel at the time, he couldn't make a living catching shrimp.

""I just basically sold it back to the bank. It was converted into an oil field tug boat,"" he says. Dozens of others have shared similar fates.

Now Curole fishes only for his family. After 20 years on a boat, his wife Margaret Curole has taken up advocacy work  first on the Louisiana Shrimp Board, then as a North American representative for fishers with the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization. What good does it do the Curoles, as former fishers, to shore their story at an event like Slow Fish when they no longer make a living on the water?

Margaret answers: ""To put a face to the fish. The more you can make people aware that there's a person behind what they're eating, then it gives them a different relationship to their food.""",[]

i toggle caption Disney Disney

For the past two weekends, the biggest movie in America has been an ambitious exploration of implicit bias set in a police department, an unmissable sign of how broadly saturated this conversation has become. Of course, the characters grappling with all this in Zootopia are talking rabbits and foxes and lions, making all this topicality easier to swallow.

There are a bunch of ways in which Zootopia is surprisingly sharp, but the places it stumbles are the same places where lots of well-intentioned movies about race and society miss the mark. It's difficult to grapple with big, systemic issues in any film, let alone one carried by woodland creatures and aimed at 9-year-olds.

But first, Zootopia's premise. A likable bunny named Judy Hopps leaves her rural community to pursue dreams of becoming a police officer in the big city. She wants to make a difference. Along the way, she learns to navigate complicated interspecies urban politics  and confront her own biases.

Zootopia, the movie's eponymous metropolis, is populated by predators and prey of all different kinds who live in relative harmony; about 90 percent of the population are prey, and 10 percent are predators. The movie is full of fun ""Let's Talk About Race"" Easter eggs. Judy thinks she's complimenting a fox by telling him he's ""articulate."" The fox is later reprimanded for touching the wool on a sheep's head without permission. When a fellow cop, a cheetah, tells Hopps she's ""cute,"" she gently corrects him  only other bunnies get to use that word.

In her first days on the new job, Hopps quickly runs into systemic problems in police departments that mirror the real world. She's the first rabbit officer in the history of Zootopia's police force  she was valedictorian of her class at the academy  which the assistant mayor counts as a win for the department's ""mammal outreach"" program. But the police brass, largely staffed by burly predators, isn't feeling the relatively tiny Hopps.

They dismiss her hire as a feel-good publicity stunt and promptly relegate her to meter maid work with the thankless task of handing out 100 parking tickets by day's end. Because she's so ambitious, Hopps gives herself an even loftier goal: 200 tickets, by noon. (More on that in a second.)

Through sheer determination and the sweat off her furry brow, Hopps makes it her mission to convince Zootopia's big dogs that creatures who look like her belong just as much as they do. (There's also another storyline involving a racial-profiling panic inadvertently set off by Hopps, in which the predators are suddenly the ones under the microscope; that arc, depressingly, could play as an allegory to any number of contemporary racial panics in America right now.)

Films about big social issues tend, almost by necessity, to follow along as one heroic individual makes choices that change the world. This tack often places Big, Thorny Issues on the shoulders of people who happen to be good or malicious, and suggest that promoting  or removing  those individuals will untie whatever big, hoary knot is strangling society at large.

That is to say, the elements you need to tell a great story hardly ever play well with the structural unpacking involved in real-life social change. That's why it's awfully easy for ""message"" films to end up wildly mischaracterizing Big Thorny Issues to the point that the takeaway becomes irrelevant  if not outright damaging  to ongoing real-life discussions about the issue in question.

YouTube

A good (awful) recent example is Spike Lee's messy Chi-Raq, a parable about gun violence in Chicago in which a woman upends the cycle of shootings through a sanctimonious, person-by-person campaign of choosing to abstain from sex. At some point, the ""just be better people"" treatment is too simplistic for the topic on the table.

In Zootopia, we follow along as our hero, Hopps, hands out hundreds of tickets to overcome workplace discrimination and prove that someone who looks like her can be a valuable member of the force. We're meant to cheer along as she rolls up her sleeves and really leans into it.

But this is not some neutral, benign practice in real life. As my colleague Joe Shapiro has reported, the festering tensions between police and residents that exploded in Ferguson rested upon a long history of aggressive, racially skewed ticketing and fines as a widely used mechanism for generating city revenue. And it has been pointed out that the practices of ticketing and stopping pedestrians and drivers for minor violations are often used by law enforcement as pretext for more expansive searches.

At this very moment, there's a closely watched lawsuit in the works brought by several black NYPD officers who claim that monthly ticketing quotas still exist in that city  where it's technically illegal  and that those quotas are enforced most heavily in neighborhoods of color. (There's a fantastic, disturbing This American Life episode about an NYPD officer who tried to speak out against these mandates from his superiors, and what happened to him when he did.)

In its zeal to show how a scrappy pint-sized hero subverts the system through sheer force of will, Zootopia misses the real-world implications of how she chooses to succeed in that mission. Ultimately, Hopps ends up doing exactly what any real-world cop trying to rise in the ranks might do  she plays by the rules. As Tracie Keesee, a former captain in the Denver police force and one of the leaders of the Center for Policing Equity, told me, officers, regardless of race, are likely to become acculturated to the ethos and systems of their departments. Any cop invested in trying to change the system from within first has to move up the ladder and secure a position of power from which to do so  and the surest way to get there is by excelling at the game in its existing form.

To wit, Hopps' reward for cracking the big case at the end: more prestige in her police department, as evidenced by her impressive new ride  which looks a whole lot like an MRAP.

I know, I know  this reads a lot like come over here and get you some of this wet blanket. And to be sure, Zootopia is welcome evidence that the conversation about policing and profiling has outgrown spaces we tend to see as expressly political. Clearly, marketers have identified a mass-market appetite for this stuff across huge swaths of America. But as this big-budget, name-brand exploration demonstrates, the most pernicious manifestations of these issues remain difficult to dramatize (or animate). When it comes to storytelling, they defy the very elements you need to make a movie like Zootopia work.",[]
npr.org,2016-03-14 00:00:00,NPR Clarifies Cokie Roberts' Role After Anti-Trump Column : The Two-Way : NPR,[],"NPR Clarifies Cokie Roberts' Role After Anti-Trump Column

i toggle caption Fred Lee/ABC via Getty Images Fred Lee/ABC via Getty Images

NPR is acting to clarify the role of longtime analyst and commentator Cokie Roberts after she co-wrote a syndicated newspaper column calling for ""the rational wing"" of the Republican Party to stop Donald Trump's march toward its presidential nomination.

NPR has a policy forbidding its journalists from taking public stances on political affairs. She has not been a full-time employee for decades, and several years ago Roberts officially was named a commentator. (The timing was confirmed in separate interviews with Roberts, NPR officials and the former senior vice president for news who made the decision.) The role gives Roberts more latitude to express opinions than the network's reporters or hosts.

""[Trump] is one of the least qualified candidates ever to make a serious run for the presidency,"" Roberts wrote late last month in a syndicated column with her husband, the journalist Steven Roberts. ""If he is nominated by a major party  let alone elected  the reputation of the United States would suffer a devastating blow around the world.""

Roberts, often described as a ""founding mother"" of NPR, left her position as a full-time staffer in 1992 for ABC News. She continued to appear regularly on NPR as a news analyst for almost two decades on a contract basis. After the change in title from news analyst to commentator, listeners may have noticed little, if any, difference in her role.

Roberts remains closely identified with NPR and presents commentary most Mondays on Morning Edition.

Roberts' column was published Feb. 26, and she did not flag its contents to NPR executives. It came to their attention after Roberts sharply questioned Trump during a March 9 appearance on MSNBC.

NPR's senior vice president for news and editorial director, Michael Oreskes, said the opinion column indicates Roberts has not been sufficiently identified to listeners as a commentator. Additionally, he wrote in a memo to staffers that news executives would work with her to refine the contours of her job.

The very public evolution of Roberts' status occurs against the backdrop of an earlier episode in which an NPR analyst's remarks in another news outlet sparked a firestorm. NPR drew a backlash when it terminated Juan Williams' contract in fall 2010 because of comments he made about Muslims on Fox News.

The greater context involves Trump himself.

As Oreskes noted, the news media continues to wrestle with how to respond to Trump. His spectacular and unsettling rise rests in part on rhetoric that has seemed to incite violence and racial tensions.

Oreskes directed Roberts to explain her reasoning behind her column  both the substantive case and Roberts' conviction she had a right and need to articulate it  in a conversation with Morning Edition host David Greene broadcast early Monday.

""Our journalists have clear instructions,"" Oreskes wrote in his memo, sent to staffers Monday morning. ""We do not support or oppose candidates. We don't advise political parties. We gather the news and seek as many points of view as we can. Cokie's role has evolved into being one of those points of view.""

In the Morning Edition interview for broadcast Monday, Greene asked Roberts: ""Objectivity is so fundamental to what we do. Can you blame people like me for being a little disappointed to hear you come out and take a personal position on something like this in a campaign?""

""If I were doing it in your role, you should be disappointed,"" Roberts said. ""Or if I were doing it covering Capitol Hill every day. I can't imagine doing that. But the truth is [that commentary] is a different role. And there are times in our history when you might be disappointed if I didn't take a position like that.""

(Click the audio at the top of the page to hear Greene and Roberts' whole conversation.)

Roberts is not the only veteran journalist to take unusual exception to Trump. In a pointed commentary that aired on NBC Nightly News in December, retired NBC anchor Tom Brokaw denounced Trump's ""dangerous proposal"" for Muslims to be prevented from entering the country. Brokaw, now a senior news analyst for NBC, said it ""overrides history, the law and the foundation of America itself.""

In an interview granted Sunday night for this article, Roberts was asked whether she had approached her job any differently with the title ""commentator"" rather than ""analyst."" She replied, ""The answer has got to be, 'No.'

""Here is my basic approach to life,"" Roberts continued. ""I am a totally unpartisan human being. I don't care which party has the right ideas  or which party has the wrong ideas. I am very, very, very interested in civility. I am interested in government working.""

Roberts cited her family's own dedication to public service  not just the congressional careers of both of her parents but, she said, a family tradition reaching back to the American Revolution. Roberts particularly pointed to Trump's sharp rhetoric on Mexicans and Muslims and his seeming encouragement of violence toward protesters.

""We are in a time where we have the possibility of going backward instead of forward,"" Roberts said. ""What's so incredibly wonderful about this country  which I believe is great and does not need to be made great  is our constant infusion of new people with new energy and new ideas.

""I know about the dark times in our history where we have gone backwards,"" Roberts said. ""Those have not been useful times in our history. Not to point out that this is a moment in history where we could be backward instead of forward might be a disservice.""",[]

In local German elections, voters delivered a harsh blow to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats over her refugee policy that saw more than a million migrants apply for asylum last year.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

The flood of migrants arriving in Germany has brought an election day backlash. Yesterday, Germans voting in local elections gave the far right populist party, Alternative for Germany, seats in half of the country's state legislatures. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson has more from Berlin.

SORAYA SARHADDI NELSON, BYLINE: It's been 50 years since right-wing populists enjoyed this level of success in Germany, and it shows just how divisive Merkel's refugee politics have become here. But even after yesterday's elections that saw Alternative for Germany take second place in one state and third in another, co-chair Frauke Petry rejected suggestions her party will pursue a far-right agenda. In an interview before the elections, she said her mandate was to provide a voice for all disgruntled voters.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

FRAUKE PETRY: Yes, we have to talk about what Germany is supposed to look like in 10 years, in 20 years' time. And I think we want to let public participate in that discussion. We don't want to leave this discussion to politicians in Parliament alone.

NELSON: The top vote-getting parties yesterday in the three states that held elections still need to form coalitions to govern. All refuse to partner with the right-wing party. Thomas Strobl heads the chancellor's party in Baden-Wurttemberg, one of three German states that elected the right-wing party yesterday.

THOMAS STROBL: (Speaking German).

NELSON: During a ZDF television talk show, Strobl confronted Petry and said, ""Alternative for Germany doesn't want to take away people's worries. It only wants to strengthen them, and that's simply not OK."" Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, meanwhile, told ZDF the results wouldn't affect Berlin's policies on migrants.

i toggle caption Image courtesy of Todd Marshall Image courtesy of Todd Marshall

Eighty million years ago, tyrannosaurs were the top predators in Asia and North America.

And scientists say a newly discovered dinosaur from Uzbekistan helps to explain their rise.

In a paper published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers said they have found a specimen from a 20 million-year gap in fossil records  between the small-bodied ""marginal hunters"" and the ""apex predators"" the tyrannosaurid group would become. This group includes Tyrannosaurus rex, Albertosaurus and Tarbosaurus.

As the paper explained, the rise of tyrannosaurs from the smaller, earlier species to ""late Cretaceous giants was one of the seminal events in dinosaur evolution."" But exactly how they developed has been mysterious, the scientists said:

""Little is known ... about how tyrannosaurids developed many of their signature features, such as their gigantic size, highly unusual brains, ears attuned to low-frequency sounds, and extensively pneumatized skulls.""

The newly discovered dinosaur called Timurlengia euotica  which the scientists said is 90 million to 92 million years old  is horse-sized, compared to Cretaceous tyrannosaurids, which could reach more than 10 meters long and weigh more than 5 tons.

The new species ""shows that tyrannosaurs had yet to achieve huge size at this time but had already evolved key brain and sensory features of the gigantic latest Cretaceous species,"" the researchers said.

The researchers added that Tyrannosaurs ""apparently developed huge size rapidly during the late Cretaceous, and their success in the top predator role may have been enabled by their brain and keen sense that first evolved at a smaller body size.""

And the scientists said the date of this specimen suggests the tyrannosaurs' growth to ""huge size and ecological dominance"" happened suddenly  though it's still a mystery what the trigger was.

This paper was prompted by the discovery of a well-preserved braincase of T. euotica in Uzbekistan's central Kyzylkum Desert, linking together other specimens. The braincase was particularly revealing because it provides evidence about the dinosaur's sensory abilities.

The paper was written by a team from Scotland, Russia and the U.S. They acknowledge that T. euotica ""remains a single data point from a still murky interval in dinosaur history.""",[]

DAVID GREENE, HOST:

And let's go now to Turkey where the president is vowing to, quote, ""bring terrorism to its knees"" after the latest attack in the capital Ankara. A car bomb yesterday near a public bus killed at least 37 people and wounded over a hundred more. So far, no one has claimed responsibility, but the Turkish military says it has launched strikes against Kurdish rebel camps in northern Iraq. NPR's Peter Kenyon has more.

PETER KENYON, BYLINE: Sunday evening in Ankara's central Kizilay Square is a busy time with residents returning from weekend trips, climbing off buses and heading for home. A number of government buildings are close by. So those who heard the large explosion as a passenger bus pulled to a stop feared the worst - that Turkey, neighbor to states convulsed in conflict and fighting a battle of its own against Kurdish militants, was once again the target of terrorism.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

UNIDENTIFIED MAN: (Foreign language spoken).

KENYON: Rescue crews sorted through the charred vehicles looking for survivors. Turkey's health minister said nearly 20 of the wounded were in critical condition. The interior minister told reporters that an investigation is underway and promised to bring those responsible to justice.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

TURKEY EFKAN ALA: (Through interpreter) We are condemning this attack, and let me repeat, this kind of violence will never overcome the determination of this nation that has overcome so many problems in the past. This determination proves that the attackers will never achieve their goals.

KENYON: Pro-government media quickly pointed to supporters of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, even though past PKK attacks have largely focused on military or police targets. An explosion last month went off near a military base in the capital killing 29. Just two days before this blast, the U.S. embassy in Ankara warned Americans about a possible terrorist threat targeting government buildings. The Obama administration condemned the attack as did NATO. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said there was no justification for such heinous acts of violence. Besides Kurdish militants, supporters of the Islamic State and extreme left-wing groups have also carried out violent attacks in Turkey in recent months.

In a statement, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said the attacks against civilians are a sign that Turkey's security forces are winning the war against terrorism, adding that he was certain of success. Just a few years ago, Turkey was stable and prospering, the envy of much of Europe. Now it's embroiled in a tense dispute with Russia that has sapped its economy, it's been swamped with migrants from Syria and is battling Kurdish militants in the South East leaving some Turks to wonder if they can avoid being sucked into the chaos destabilizing the region.

Brazil faces its worst recession in nearly a century, and a fraud scandal has ensnared an ex-president. Scores of demonstrators are calling for the impeachment of current President Dilma Rousseff.

RENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:

Brazil saw protests yesterday. Record-setting numbers of people came out in cities and towns across the country. Demonstrators were calling for President Dilma Rousseff to go at a time when Brazil is in crisis, both economic and political. NPR's Lourdes Garcia-Navarro reports.

(SOUNDBITE OF PROTEST)

UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTERS: (Chanting in Portuguese).

LOURDES GARCIA-NAVARRO, BYLINE: There was drumming and chanting and a giant inflatable chicken and even a dance flash mob. Across South America's largest country, Brazilians were inventive in expressing their anger aimed squarely at President Dilma Rousseff.

MARCELO CARNEIRO: It's very clear for us that Dilma doesn't have the ability to run the country anymore and do the economic changes that we need to do to keep growing. So it's just a matter of time before justice gets her hands on her.

ANDRE ANTULIUS: I think that it's time for a change in our country. I think that we need to change our government.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: That was Marcelo Carneiro, a 31-year-old business manager, and Andre Antulius, a 38-year-old systems analyst, who were out protesting in Sao Paulo yesterday, calling for the impeachment or resignation of Rousseff. The respected Datafolha polling agency said nearly half a million people took to Sao Paulo's streets. It was, according to them, the biggest protest in Sao Paulo's history. And it was only one of many across the country. Even the northeast of Brazil, long a bastion of support for the leftist government of Dilma Rousseff, saw large demonstrations.

ELIANE CANTANHEDE: (Speaking Portuguese).

GARCIA-NAVARRO: We reached Eliane Cantanhede, a political commentator in the capital, by phone. She says Brazil's political establishment is inflamed because this is a crisis without precedent.

CANTANHEDE: (Speaking Portuguese).

GARCIA-NAVARRO: ""I think the size of these demonstrations,"" she says, ""have surprised even the government. They are truly historic, and they will have a very strong impact on the forces in Congress trying to push Dilma out,"" she says.

Michael Mohallem is a legal expert with the Getulio Vargas Foundation in Rio. He says the economic situation is what's really hurting Rousseff. Last year, the economy contracted by 3.8 percent. It was the worst performance in generations.

MICHAEL MOHALLEM: We are in the middle of a hurricane. And we can't find a way out of it.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: Barring her resignation, he says, there are no good options for unseating a democratically elected leader who hasn't been proved to have done anything criminal. There is an impeachment process against Rousseff. But the case is weak. He says he believes it's unlikely that Dilma will survive, though.

MOHALLEM: I think if she goes through the impeachment without a very clear, strong reason, I think we're going to be creating a very bad precedent for Brazilian democracy.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: This is a politically polarized country right now. And Rousseff does have her supporters, like Jorge Antonio das Neves, a 29-year-old doctor sitting at a bar, having lunch in a middle-class neighborhood in Rio yesterday.

JORGE ANTONIO DAS NEVES: (Speaking Portuguese).

GARCIA-NAVARRO: ""I think this is a coup,"" he says. ""I think the opposition on the right is taking advantage of the situation,"" he says.

Driving this crisis is the massive corruption scandal at the state oil company. It has left almost no one unscathed. This month, once-renovated former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva was taken in for questioning and is the subject of federal and state investigations.

The head of the lower house of Congress, who is from a rival party, is also implicated among many others. So perhaps the only winner in yesterday's demonstrations was the judge, Sergio Moro, who has overseen the prosecutions in the corruption case. Protesters paraded in Moro masks and held up Moro dolls wearing superhero capes. Lourdes Garcia-Navarro, NPR News, Rio de Janeiro.

npr.org,2016-03-14 00:00:00,Dentists Have Better Ways To Prevent Cavities In Adults : Shots,[],"No-Drill Dentistry: Fluoride Treatments Can Prevent Cavities In Adults

i Vidhya Nagarajan for NPR Vidhya Nagarajan for NPR

If the high-pitched whir of a dentist's drill as it bores into your molar terrifies you, good news! There could be fewer fillings in your future. A painless way to prevent cavities in adults is gaining traction.

""OK, Alice, we are going to put the fluoride varnish on your teeth,"" says Marion Manski, director of the dental hygiene program at the University of Maryland School of Dentistry. Fluoride varnish is standard practice for children's teeth, but Manski's patient, Alice Clash, is 91 years old. Like many older patients, Clash is taking medications that cause dry mouth, which puts her at high risk for cavities.

So Manski takes a skinny brush and a little pot of yellowish liquid and paints the varnish on Clash's teeth. ""We know that saliva helps us wash away bacteria and food in the mouth,"" Manski says. ""The fluoride varnish will help that.""

One way fluoride helps is by seeping into the enamel and drawing the calcium and phosphate that's naturally present in the saliva. The minerals boost the teeth's natural healing process and make them more resistant to future decay. But there are other theories about how fluoride works. It strengthens the enamel before the tooth erupts, which is why it's so important for children. And it attacks the acid-producing bacteria in the mouth. One study shows fluoride makes it more difficult for these bacteria to stick to the teeth.

It takes about a minute, and the fluoride treatment is done. Some patients are also given a prescription for a concentrated fluoride gel that can be used at night.

""These preventative approaches work on adults just as well as they do on children,"" says Norman Tinanoff, a professor of pediatric dentistry at the University of Maryland. He says part of what's making fluoride treatments popular for adults is a move to make dental care personal, with an individual treatment plan for each patient. To do that, you have to weigh a patient's risk of getting cavities.

One of the biggest proponents of this approach is John Featherstone, dean of the University of California, San Francisco School of Dentistry. Featherstone came up with a comprehensive way of measuring a person's risk for caries, or tooth decay. It includes testing the level of bacteria in the mouth, and looking at dietary habits, medical conditions, medications, saliva flow and history of tooth decay. When Featherstone put his patients on personal treatment plans, he found the strategy worked.

""It really proved that drilling and filling did not fix the disease,"" Featherstone says. ""Putting in a filling fixes that hole in the tooth, but it doesn't deal with the bacteria in the rest of the mouth."" Most bacteria are friendly, but a couple of bad actors can cause cavities. These guys feed on sugars and expel acid that eats away at the enamel.

Traditionally, dentists were taught that the only way to deal with decay was to drill it out. That's still important in some cases, Featherstone says, but without fixing the underlying problem of bad bacteria, patients just keep coming back for more fillings. Featherstone saw another way. ""It's a little bit like your car is starting to rust,"" he says. ""If you can stop the rust before the rust goes right through the body of the car, then you're in good shape.""

Like rust, tooth decay is a slow process. A full-on cavity is a hole that needs to be fixed. But if you catch decay early, Featherstone says, it can be reversed using fluoride treatments like varnish and concentrated toothpaste and gels.

""In the past we believed tooth decay was a rapidly progressive disease. But research shows it's slowly progressive,"" says Wendell Evans, associate professor of dentistry at the University of Sydney in Australia. He recently published a study that found using these techniques reduced the need for fillings in adults by 30 to 50 percent.

Striking as these results seem, the concept isn't new. This shift to a preventive model of dentistry is decades in the making. ""Some of the stuff in our study has been known for 50 years,"" Evans says, referring to the use of fluoride treatments.

""Prevention has always been a part of the world of dentistry,"" says Richard Valachovic, president of the American Dental Education Association. ""What we're seeing is a generational shift,"" Valachovic says. As dentists have come to better understand the microbiology of the mouth, more effective preventive techniques have followed.

But cost has been an issue. Insurance companies routinely pay for fluoride treatments for children, but not so much for adults. The National Association of Dental Plans couldn't give a definitive answer about coverage, but calls to some individual carriers and dental offices suggest it depends entirely on the type of plan you have. Some higher-end plans cover two fluoride treatments per year, while cheaper plans tend not to cover any. If you pay out of pocket, a varnish treatment costs from $23 to $55, compared with a filling, which ranges from $86 to $606, according to the American Dental Association.

Cost could also be a factor for dentists. Featherstone and Wendell say some dentists may be reluctant to embrace the preventive methods because they worry they'll lose money if they they do fewer costly procedures.

At this point, Featherstone says, two-thirds of dental schools in the U.S. teach some kind of disease management model based on a thorough risk assessment. And he expects that at some point all dentists will follow a preventive protocol.

""It will happen,"" Featherstone says. ""It's just a matter of time.""",[]
