Michigan State coach Tom Izzo joins Mike & Mike to share his thoughts on how the NCAA tournament will shape up this year and to express why it's been a tough year for coaches due to the number of surprising upsets and setbacks. (1:40)

Ever since we remodeled the basement here at GK Central, we have had more room to work on advanced mathematics and take a look at some questions weve been meaning to address for a long time.

For example, our statistical model combs through historical data to find the traits common to the teams that pull off or succumb to big NCAA tournament upsets. But weve always wanted to find ways beyond citing the same old key metrics to get across how those teams play. And now, with help from our Giant Killer colleagues at Furman University, we have developed a new toy for doing just that: similarity. For any given team, our similarity method shows the five most comparable Giants or Killers from our historical database (which dates back to 2007), measured by what matters to Giants and Killers. Knowing a programs most similar squads, you can get a better feel for its style -- and how it will fare.

The basic math behind this is pretty straightforward. (But feel free to skip this paragraph if you prefer to hide your vegetables under the mashed potatoes.) Suppose that on a graph, Point A is 3 inches away from Point B horizontally, and 4 inches away vertically. Using the Pythagorean theorem we all learned in high school, we can figure out pretty quickly that the distance from A to B along a straight line is 5 inches. In the same way, we can combine distances on any two metrics and see how close two teams are. For instance, Oklahoma plays at a quick tempo and has faced a tough schedule this season. If we look only at those two scales, the most similar teams to Oklahoma in 2016 -- other programs that have played at both a fast pace and against strong opponents -- would be UCLA, Wake Forest and Iowa State. Our similarity method extends this technique to measure the distance between teams while balancing all of the shooting, rebounding, turnover and pace statistics that define Giants and Killers. And then it looks for each teams closest neighbors.

Now that the basic math lesson is out of the way, heres what caught our eye once we crunched the numbers. First, to the Giants:",[]
espn.com,,Colt McCoy's return to Washington Redskins all about comfort,['John Keim'],"The Washington Redskins finalized one position before free agency began: quarterback. Colt McCoy will re-sign with Washington, ESPNs Adam Schefter reported.

For both sides, the decision was all about comfort. The Redskins have invested a lot in McCoy, and McCoy has invested a lot in Washington's system. Dont take that to mean they settled for one another, though; make no mistake -- McCoy is the guy the Redskins wanted in this role. Washington wasn't interest in trading for a failed starter.

McCoy said via text that his comfort level and confidence in Washington's offense was critical to his decision.

""I felt confident all year that if I was counted on, Id be able to produce,"" he said at the end of the season. ""Thats a product of [quarterbacks coach Matt Cavanaugh, head coach Jay Gruden, offensive coordinator Sean McVay], the system. I cant say enough about as a player how confident I am within our scheme and what we do. I trusted the guys on our team, we have great talent all around.""

McCoy gets some security by signing a three-year deal that can be voided to two after having signed one-year deals each of the past two offseasons with Washington. Because of him, there is a good chance the Redskins only keep two quarterbacks on the roster this season (with a third perhaps on the practice squad; this, of course, is not definite).

But for a guy who strongly believes in himself, re-signing provides a chance to grow in a system -- last season was the first time McCoy had played in the same offense in consecutive years. That way, when he gets a chance to play, it gives him a much better opportunity to succeed.

I always go back to the Trent Green days. He was in Norv Turners offense for five seasons, which made a huge difference when he finally had a chance to play. He was not a big-bodied quarterback with a cannon arm, but he knew where to go with the ball and when. Green cashed in after his one partial season as the Redskins' starter; I dont know if that will happen with McCoy, but scenarios like that are why he wanted to stay in the same offense.

McCoy called Cavanaugh the MVP of the team for the way he handled the position, allowing McVay to focus on running the offense. But the reason Washington likes McCoy is because of how he handled his role, too. It was a difficult season for him, but it didnt show -- and he considers both Kirk Cousins and Robert Griffin III friends. One person in the organization termed the quarterback room ""awkward,"" which is probably a kind way of saying ""tension-filled."" But McCoy navigated it well. He always expressed how happy he was for Cousins while admitting that, as a competitor, ""its tough.""

""Im happy to be part of a team that won,"" he said after the season ended. ""Obviously you want to play, but you find ways to be part of it behind the scenes. I worked really hard this year, and I still feel I gained a lot of confidence in my ability. Even though I didnt play much, it was still a good year.""",[]

espn.com,,Ha Na Jang closes with 65 to win HSBC Women's Champions by 4 strokes,"['Bob Harig', 'Pa Sport', 'Jason Sobel']","SINGAPORE -- South Korea's Ha Na Jang enhanced her growing reputation as one of the hottest players on the LPGA Tour by winning the HSBC Women's Champions tournament by 4 strokes on Sunday.

Playing like a seasoned veteran, the 23-year-old South Korean fired six birdies and an eagle in a brilliant final round of 7-under 65 to finish at 19 under at Singapore's Sentosa Golf Club.

Her playing partner, Thailand's Pornanong Phatlum, closed with a bogey-free 68 to take second at 15 under while South Korea's Amy Yang birdied the last hole for a 71 to take third place with 11 under, 1 shot clear of a group of five players.

Jang captured her maiden LPGA title at the Coates Golf Championship in Florida last month and has quickly made it two.

""I was very comfortable this week,"" Jang said. ""My target in 2016 was two wins, but right now I'm there, so I'm going to change my target.""

Not only is the South Korean emerging as one of the hottest players on the LPGA Tour, but she's also developing a cult following with her elaborate celebrations.

When she won in Florida, she impersonated a samurai swordsman, and on Sunday, she provided her own rendition of Beyonce by dancing on the 18th green.

Jang said she had been thinking about copying some of Beyonce's moves after watching her perform at the Super Bowl, and winning her second title seemed like the perfect time to break it out.

""I'm trying to be like Beyonce, the single lady. I'm single right now, too, I try the single lady,"" she explained.

Leading by a single stroke entering the day, she immediately extended her advantage to 2 shots when she rolled in a 12-foot birdie putt on the opening hole on Sunday, offering a taste of what was to come.

She made a second birdie on the par-5 fifth when her bunker shot for eagle caught the edge of the hole and left her with a tap-in and then drained a long uphill putt for birdie on the ninth to lead by 3 at the turn.

Jang made her first bogey in 50 holes when she miscued her drive then hit a tree branch on the 11th, but she reeled off three birdies in a row from the 12th, including successive monster putts from 30 and 50 feet.

""I haven't seen that before. My putts today were really amazing,"" she said.

Jang went to the final hole with a commanding 3-stroke lead but resisted the temptation to play safe, flirting with the water as she attacked the flag.

She landed her ball a few feet away from the hole, then stepped up and sank the eagle putt and broke into an impromptu jig.

""My nickname is HaNa-Gizer. I'm in a very strong and happy space, yeah,"" she said.",[]

Masur said the pair were close friends and Tomic's criticism of Kyrgios' unavailability for the weekend's loss to the United States in Melbourne would not create lingering issues.

""What's happened has happened, and for me the best thing is that they both play Indian Wells in five days time,"" Masur told Fox Sports News.

""That they just meet up in the locker room ... shake hands and just get on with it.

""We don't play another Davis Cup tie until September so there will be a lot of water under the bridge from now until then.""

Tomic, who was battling with a wrist injury, accused Kyrgios of ""faking"" an illness in Sunday's four-set loss to world No.11 Jack Isner during a courtside chat with coach Lleyton Hewitt.

Kyrgios later fired back on Twitter, telling Tomic he would not have his back anytime soon.

Heat of the moment, not gonna take it personally. Indian wells a week away, plenty of time. - Nicholas Kyrgios (@NickKyrgios) March 6, 2016

Just don't expect me to have your back anytime soon. - Nicholas Kyrgios (@NickKyrgios) March 6, 2016

However Masur defended Kyrgios' absence from the tie after he was ruled out by medical staff on Thursday.

""I didn't see him but the word was that he had a virus and his actual mouth was ulcerated and the guy was pretty fatigued,"" he said.

Masur's claims were backed up by Kyrgios' Davis Cup teammate John Peers, who said he was ""a little"" disappointed by Tomic's mid-match comments.

""But I think Bernie just got a little heated in the moment but it all calmed itself down,"" he said.

""I think Lleyton made the right decision to begin with. Nick came down to do a fitness test and according to medical staff didn't get through it.

""So Lleyton had to make the tough decision and go with the strongest team we could put out on the field that was healthy to play.""",[]

espn.com,,Re-signing Haloti Ngata shouldn't keep Detroit Lions from drafting DT,"['Mike Clay', 'Michael Rothstein']","Haloti Ngata is returning to the Detroit Lions. This should not preclude the franchise from investing in a defensive tackle early in Aprils NFL draft.

Bringing back Ngata and Tyrunn Walker solidifies the middle of the defensive line for now, but neither player is on a long-term deal. Walker is on a one-year, prove-it deal for the second straight season. Ngata is signing a two-year deal and enters the 2016 season at age 32.

Ngata wanted to remain with the Lions after being traded to Detroit from Baltimore a year ago. And a half-hour before free agency officially kicked off, he got his wish.

This is helpful for the Lions as well, at least in the short term. The team doesnt have to focus on getting an immediate starter at defensive tackle in the draft and can find a guy who can work into the rotation first before being thrust into a major role. Thats important for a defense that focuses so much on having its linemen attack instead of react, a system that takes time to learn.

Now if the Lions draft a defensive tackle, he will have time to learn behind Ngata before potentially taking over for him. It also keeps the same mentor in place for Walker and the Lions other young defensive tackles, Caraun Reid and Gabe Wright.

It is essentially what Detroit tried to do  successfully  with cornerback Rashean Mathis a few years ago. This is a new regime from the one that signed Mathis, but the thought process should be similar. Let Ngata play and help the people who will eventually take over for him.

Ngata showed in the second half of the season that he still had something left to give a franchise after he struggled through injury and then subpar play during the beginning of last season. He made a difference in the middle as a space-eater and run-stopper over the final eight games of the season for the Lions, when the team went 6-2.

The age of Ngata and the continued one-year deals for Walker could mean neither player is guaranteed to be with the Lions for long. For the long-term health of the franchise, drafting an interior defensive lineman is critical.

But in the short term, the Lions have to feel good about what they have in the middle of the defensive line as they try to continue to build Teryl Austins defensive scheme.",[]

espn.com,,Payment processors leaving among big issues surrounding industry,"['Ben Fawkes', 'David Purdum', 'Darren Rovell', 'Mackenzie Kraemer', 'Steve Fainaru', 'Arash Markazi', 'Paula Lavigne', 'Ryan Rodenberg', 'Tim Fiorvanti']","During an optimistic Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA) conference last month in Dallas, the recipe for the daily fantasy sports (DFS) industry's success in 2016 was made public.

""We are actively engaged with elected legislators and regulators across the country and in Washington to ensure that the millions of fantasy sports fans across the country can continue to play the games they love,"" DraftKings' Griffin Finan said in a widely reported statement earlier about lobbying efforts being made.

With a mix of state-level legislative and legal developments progressing on a weekly basis, Chalk explores four big issues surrounding the DFS industry in 2016.

Will the upcoming hearing in the New Jersey sports betting case affect DFS?

The next hearing in the New Jersey sports wagering case is set for Feb. 17. The litigation between the five major American sports leagues and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie -- the NCAA, NBA, NFL, NHL and MLB first sued in August 2012 -- has briefly touched on fantasy issues.

""We note, however, the legal difference between paying fees to participate in fantasy leagues and single-game wagering as contemplated by [New Jersey's] Wagering Law,"" wrote a federal appellate court in a September 2013 ruling on the case. Editor's Picks Purdum: Mark Cuban leads optimism flowing at FSTA, despite industry turmoil What's the current mentality of the fantasy sports industry? Surprisingly, it's cautiously optimistic, reports David Purdum from the Fantasy Sports Trade Association conference in Dallas.

Report: Payment processor to halt DFS business Vantiv Entertainment Solutions, a payment processor and major player in the daily fantasy sports business, will reportedly cease its operations in that space as of Saturday. 1 Related

Documents released in the New York DFS litigation shed further light on how fantasy operators differentiate themselves from traditional sports betting.

""The key to the distinction between fantasy sports and sports wagering, however, is that fantasy sports require the consistent and recognizable involvement of the contestants, almost to the point of immersion in the contest, to achieve success; such that the activity transforms from something outside their control to something within their control,"" wrote attorney Anthony Cabot in a March 22, 2013 letter to DraftKings executive Tim Dent.

Two lawyers writing to FanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles touched on the subject too.

""Unlike sports wagering, which was outlawed in part to protect the integrity of professional and amateur sports, fantasy sports contests do not create the risk of impairing the integrity of sporting events,"" wrote Marc J. Zwillinger and Jacob A. Sommer in a Nov. 10, 2014 letter.

Recent filings in the litigation with the New York Attorney General made a consistent distinction as well.

""[F]antasy sports contestants are not mere observers betting on sporting events,"" wrote FanDuel attorney John S. Kiernan on Jan. 4, 2016. ""They are contestants themselves in a separate bona fide contest, competing against each other.""

""DraftKings fantasy contests are not tethered to the outcomes of real-world sporting events,"" wrote DraftKings lawyers in a Jan. 4, 2016 court filing.

While intervening co-defendants with Gov. Christie have argued the five sports league plaintiffs possess ""unclean hands"" as a result of their embrace of DFS, there is no indication that fantasy sports will be pivotal in the resolution of the long-running case.

A decision in the New Jersey sports betting case probably will be released in a few months.

Will other payment processors follow Citigroup and Vantiv?

The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 -- often referred to as UIGEA -- limits certain online activities by making it illegal to process gambling-related payments.

""Payment processors and payment gateways ... serve as a critical financial intermediary between players and DFS sites,"" wrote industry expert Chris Grove in a Nov. 11, 2015 LegalSportsReport article. ""Without access to these processors and gateways, DFS sites would be effectively unable to operate.""

With the legality of daily fantasy in flux in certain states, some payment processors sensitive to UIGEA may believe the risk isn't worth it, especially if DFS transactions are not a big percentage of their overall business.

Last week, Citigroup opted to discontinue FanDuel and DraftKings payments in New York.

Vantiv Entertainment Solutions, a large publicly traded payment processor, made waves late last month when the company became the first to announce that it would stop servicing New York-based fantasy transactions at the end of February. Vantiv and DraftKings are involved in litigation in Massachusetts, New York and Ohio.

""As you are aware, an increasing number of state attorneys general have determined that [DFS] constitutes illegal gambling,"" wrote Vantiv's Jonathan Ellman in a recent letter to DFS operators as first reported by the New York Times.

FanDuel issued a statement last week in the wake of Vantiv's decision.

""[T]here are many other payment processors available, as well as PayPal, and this decision will not impact their ability to play on FanDuel, withdraw funds, or have any other impact on the user experience,"" wrote FanDuel.

PayPal followed up with a statement of its own earlier this week, which likely reflects the feeling of many payment processors.

""We continue to review and consider ongoing developments in relation to Daily Fantasy Sports,"" a PayPal spokesperson said.

Will the federal government get involved with DFS?

The most prominent possibility for a federal role remains the specter of Congressional hearings. Recently released records indicate that DraftKings spent about $80,000 on Congressional lobbying during the fourth quarter of 2015.

""When and if Congress wants to talk about fantasy sports, we welcome the opportunity,"" FSTA chairman Peter Schoenke said last month in a statement first reported by USA Today.

One issue that could come up in any Congressional hearing is taxes.

A former Assistant U.S. Attorney has informed the Internal Revenue Service about possible tax implications stemming from daily fantasy.

""DFS businesses ... are clearly engaged in betting or wagering for purposes of the wagering excise tax,"" wrote Michael K. Fagan in an Aug. 22, 2015 letter sent to a half-dozen senior IRS employees and recently obtained by Chalk. As a federal prosecutor, Fagan successfully prosecuted a prominent offshore sports gambling website a decade ago.

""The excise tax component was an important part of the government's case [in 2006] given the law's broad scope,"" Fagan told Chalk in a phone interview.

""The federal excise tax for wagers is not well-known,"" said Marc Dunbar, a gaming lawyer at Jones Walker in Florida. ""But the plain language of the Internal Revenue Code applies to wagers on a 'sports event' or 'contest,' including contests of skill such as spelling bees.""

According to some, the skill versus chance distinction so important in state-level disputes may be irrelevant for federal excise tax purposes as set forth in IRS Form 730.

""The way the tax code is written, all wagers on sporting events and contests (including skill contests) are included,"" emailed Kate Lowenhar-Fisher, a gaming industry attorney at Dickinson Wright in Las Vegas. ""The tax seems to apply to a category of activities that may be broader than 'gambling.'""

Experts were unaware if some or all of the daily fantasy companies are currently paying the excise tax. ""I don't know for a fact whether they are paying the excise tax,"" said Fagan, who did not receive a response to his letter. ""Given their marketing and public statements claiming not to be gambling, my educated guess is that they are not paying the excise tax.""

Tax status for individual companies is confidential.

""The IRS declines to comment on this issue,"" Internal Revenue Service spokesman Bruce I. Friedland told Chalk last month after receiving a copy of Fagan's letter. In a follow-up email to Chalk last week, Friedland wrote that he had ""no additional information"" to provide.

Last week, the New York Times reported that agents from the IRS criminal investigation division ""are examining how fantasy games affect problem gamblers.""

Fagan's 11-page letter to the IRS also was sent to two members of Congress in September, including Republican U.S. Rep. Fred Upton. Congressman Upton has previously said a fantasy-related hearing is likely this year. Earlier this week, The Hill reported Upton as saying the potential hearing has yet to be set.

What happened to all of the private lawsuits about DFS?

Dozens of fantasy-related lawsuits were filed starting in October. Leading DFS operators were the target of the vast majority of the suits. A few complaints listed sports league investors, media companies, payment processors and individual fantasy contestants as defendants too. Various claims were put forth.

""Approximately 42 of these actions involve insider trading allegations, 36 involve illegal gambling allegations and eight involve bonus fraud allegations,"" wrote Panel on Multidistrict Litigation Chair Sarah S. Vance in a dense eight-page ruling released last week. ""We conclude that the District of Massachusetts is the appropriate transferee district for this litigation.""

The now-consolidated lawsuits in Boston have been renamed In re: Daily Fantasy Sports Litigation and assigned to U.S. District Court Judge George O'Toole. There is no immediate timetable for proceedings to begin.

One of the most unique private lawsuits was filed by NFL player Pierre Garcon against FanDuel. In the case, Garcon had alleged misuse of his name and likeness without consent. Garcon's lawsuit was recently settled out of court.",[]

espn.com,,Dan Szymborski's nostalgic look back at underperforming but memorable Hearthstone cards leaving competitive play,"['James Obscurica', 'James Bates', 'Alan Nahaz', 'Obscurica Chen', 'Stephen Chiu', 'Dan Szymborski', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Timothy Lee', 'Tyler Fionn', 'Arash Markazi']","In card games, sometimes the most underpowered cards find redemption. When looking at Hearthstone, one such card was Warsong Commander, a rarely played card from the Basic set that helped power Patron Warrior decks when that was easily the most frightening archetype on the competitive scene. Paladin secrets, a whole array of one-mana cards that rarely saw play, suddenly became powerful when combined with Mysterious Challenger. New cards can sometimes make some of the least played cards into staples of the most powerful decks.

With the introduction of Standard play, time has run out for the lesser lights from the Curse of Naxxramas and Goblins vs. Gnomes set to pen similar comeback stories. Since the Standard announcement, we've mostly focused on the strongest cards leaving competitive play -- cards such as Dr. Boom, Piloted Shredder, Mad Scientist and Sludge Belcher. But some of Blizzard's most entertaining but rarely played cards -- many of which are steeped in the World of Warcraft lore that has been a crucial staple of Hearthstone -- are also departing from the competitive scene. Some of these cards are overcosted. Some just never found a constructed deck that was a good home, or were just too difficult to enable. Let's give one last tribute to the coolest cards leaving play, before they depart for the Island of Misfit Toys (and the occasional Wild game played for nostalgia's sake).

Bolvar Fordragon

Blizzard

For those players familiar with World of Warcraft lore, seeing Bolvar Fordragon on a card was an exciting moment, as he played a crucial role in the Wrath of the Lich King expansion. His card, a five-mana 1/7 that gained +1 Attack for every card that died while he was in your hand, saw little tournament play. Goblins vs. Gnomes was released on December 8th, 2014 and, according to the tournament deck database at Hearthstone Top Deck, last saw competitive play just three weeks later. There's no denying that, even if Bolvar was a bad card, he was certainly a cool card. Octavian 'Kripparrian' Morosan of Team SoloMid, a Hearthstone caster and the most watched Hearthstone player in the world, shared his opinion of Bolvar with ESPN.

This card is a powerhouse on paper, often reaching double-digit attack levels, and having the health to back it up as well. It was always overlooked because of the extremely poor draw potential, as it takes a few turns sitting in your hand to actually reach its potential. But the real issue has been the other cards that were launched with him. Naxxramas and GvG brought the Deathrattle zoo and aggro themes to Hearthstone, and Silence came back in order to attempt to counter some of these effects. The strongest all-around legendary was also released in GvG, Dr. Boom, which forced most midrange and control decks to run Big Game Hunter just to counter it. Both of these factors consequently made Bolvar unplayable, as he does not escape the tech choices of the decks sourced from this set. In a different time, Bolvar could have been an amazing and common addition to midrange Paladin decks everywhere, but instead his fame will only live on in the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.

Gahz'rilla

Blizzard

A card that doubles its attack every time it took damage is a power effect. Gahz'rilla became a popular card to fool around with on fun videos -- if you could damage it three times on the board it became a crazy 48-attack card -- but a few problems kept it from ever seeing serious play, outside of the occasional Webspinner draw.

A seven-mana card typically has to have an immediate impact on the board to see play, and Hunter has limited resources to both get the Gahz'rilla to be usable immediately and to get the immediate damage on it to double its attack to 12. Further complicating its use was that successful Hunter archetypes, whether the Face Hunter or the slightly slower Midrange Hunter, simply didn't have time to use the card. Even assuming you could get Tundra Rhino to stick to the board, so that Gahz'rilla had Charge the next turn, you also had to assemble Gahz'rilla and a tool to damage it -- and most of the time, by the time you got all the pieces, the Hunter had already lost.

Wee Spellstopper

Blizzard

While Bolvar at least got experimented with in decks for a few weeks, Wee Spellstopper didn't even get that far, and was generally ignored from the start. The only card in the game to date with the ability to prevent other cards from being targeted, the Spellstopper never even found a niche as a defensive tech choice.

""This is one of those cards that I wish had worked in competitive play,"" explained Kacem 'Noxious' Khilaji of compLexity Gaming. ""It just failed miserably because it wasn't good enough on tempo. The card was there to protect your stuff, but it's not protected itself, so once it goes way, everything else dies as well.""

Blizzard

Anub'ar Ambusher and Dancing Swords

In a game in which board control is so important, cards with powerful stats but a crucial downside are a common feature found in decks. Early on in Hearthstone's history, King Mukla saw play in very aggressive decks, simply because getting a 5/5 card for three mana is worth giving your opponent +1/+1 Bananas -- because the intention was to kill the opponent before they ever got to make use of the buff cards. Deathlord, which put a card from your opponent's deck in play when it died, still saw play on-and-off simply because a 2/8 card with Taunt for three mana is a powerful tool against agro decks.

For Anub'ar Ambusher and Dancing Swords, the drawback turned out to be too much for what they brought to the table. While the Ambusher's deathrattle of sending another card back into your hand had potential synergy with certain Battlecry cards like Big Game Hunter, more often than not, the opponent, with first crack at killing it, got to choose the time to eliminate it -- frequently resulting in a loss of tempo. As for Dancing Swords, a 4/4 for three is nice, but giving your opponent a potential card in return for one more attack is typically a poor tradeoff, and the effect wasn't strong enough to see the Swords in mill decks.

The Foe Reaper 4000 was one of my personal favorite unplayed cards in Naxxramas/GVG, both because of the powerful effect and, simply, the fact that it was essentially the Scarecrow from Wizard of Oz turned into an angry, out-of-control robot. Who doesn't love angry robots? Chris 'ChanmanV' Chan, host of Value Town shares my passion for this murderous mech:

""If the Foe Reaper stays on the board for a turn, it's impossible to remove, simply because of how it can clear the board all by itself. But it was also so hard to play because there are so many good single-target removal cards in Hearthstone and removing it from the board is always a priority. It's always been a favorite of mine, because if you were able to get it to stick, it didn't matter if you were going up against Patron Warrior, Handlock, or Secret Paladin, it would likely clear the board.""

Troggzor the Earthinator

Blizzard

Someone at Blizzard loves Homestar Runner, the internet series that created Trogdor the Burninator in 2003. Troggzor had an interesting effect, summoning a 3/5 Burly Rockjaw Trogg every time your opponent cast a spell. While the effect was similar to another defensive card, Loatheb -- a card that is also leaving the tournament meta, but has been a popular staple -- Troggzor only gave magic use long-term consequences rather than directly hindering it, as Loatheb did. One popular use of Loatheb was to hinder the Druid Force of Nature/Savage Roar combo for a turn, but Troggzor wouldn't stop it -- instead summoning two Burly Rockjaw Troggs in response, which didn't matter if you were already dead. While Hearthstone was (and remains) fairly light in seven-mana cards that you could just drop on a board, and Troggzor appeared to fit the bill, a better card released at the same time fulfilled that task even better: the much-reviled Dr. Boom.

Anima Golem

Blizzard

At six mana, a 9/9 card represents overwhelming power for its cost. But as you may have guessed, something that strong for that cheap has to come with a significant downside. In this case the drawback is that, at the end of each turn, if the Anima Golem is your only card on the board it has to be destroyed.

""That card looks like it should work in some circumstances,"" said Noxious. ""But even with Dreadsteed, there's no dependable way to enable it. Because of the setup required to make it work, it could be a six mana 25/25, and it dies just as often. You never get to attack with it.""

Sneed's Old Shredder

Blizzard

Sneed's, I will miss you most of all. Overcosted for its base stats, Sneed's Old Shredder was interesting because of the powerful Deathrattle, which summoned a random Legendary minion to takes its place after it died. Problem is, first you have to spend the eight mana to get an underpowered card on the board. Then you have to actually kill it and, only then, so long as it wasn't silenced, did you finally get that Deathrattle to trigger -- making it an incredibly slow card to wring value from. Getting a free Ragnaros or Archmage Antonidas is incredible, but if Nat Pagle or Lorewalker Cho popped from the Shredder, you were left cursing your opponent, Blizzard programmers, and the world that created you.

Sneed's saw some light play in tournaments after GvG release, but due to the drawbacks, its last competitive hurrah was in The Pinnacle 3 tournament, during which David 'Dog' Caero of Team Liquid and Jan 'Ek0p' Palys both included it in their decks -- but that was more than a year ago.

Do you have a personal favorite unplayable card leaving Standard? Let us know in the comments or on social media, and maybe take it into battle one last time on ladder before it is exiled to the Wild format.",[]
espn.com,,Two Kenya athletes allege doping bribery,"['Sue Mott', 'One Naci N', 'Gordon Simpson', 'Pa Sport', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Bonnie D', 'Wayne Drehs', 'Espn Staff', 'Johnette Howard', 'Jim Caple']","EMBU, Kenya -- Two Kenyan athletes serving four-year bans for doping at the 2015 world championships say the chief executive of Athletics Kenya, the country's governing body for track and field, asked them each for a $24,000 bribe to reduce their suspensions.

Joy Sakari and Francisca Koki Manunga told The Associated Press that CEO Isaac Mwangi asked for the payment in an Oct. 16 meeting, but that they could not raise the money. They were informed of their four-year bans in a Nov. 27 email, but never filed a criminal complaint because, they say, they had no proof to back up their bribery accusation and also feared repercussions.

Mwangi dismissed the allegation as ""just a joke,"" denied ever meeting privately with the athletes and said Athletics Kenya has no power to shave time off athletes' bans.

""We have heard stories, athletes coming and saying, `Oh, you know, I was asked for money,"" Mwangi said. ""But can you really substantiate that?""

Sakari, a 400-meter runner, and Manunga, a hurdler, told AP they would be willing to testify to the ethics commission of the IAAF, the global governing body of athletics.

The commission already is investigating allegations that AK officials sought to subvert anti-doping in Kenya, solicited bribes and offered athletes reduced bans. The probe has led to the suspensions of AK's president, Isaiah Kiplagat, a vice president, David Okeyo, and AK's former treasurer, Joseph Kinyua.

Sharad Rao, a former director of prosecutions in Kenya who also has adjudicated cases for the Court of Arbitration for Sport, is leading the ethics investigation for the International Association of Athletics Federations. Sakari and Manunga's decision to come forward could be a breakthrough, because Kenyan athletes have been unwilling to act as whistleblowers.

""There is obviously the reluctance on the part of the athletes to come forward,"" Rao said. ""They don't want to stand out.""

As many as a half-dozen banned athletes have privately indicated to the IAAF commission that AK officials sought to extort them and that they feel their sanctions might have been less if they had paid bribes, Rao said.

AP's interview with Sakari and Manunga is the first time Kenyan athletes have detailed such allegations publicly.

""That information would, of course, be very, very significant, very important for us,"" Rao said.

Rao said he has been talking to at least one other athlete who may have been approached for a bribe, and that his first priority was to get responses from Kiplagat, Okeyo and Kinyua -- all three of whom have flatly denied to him that they took or solicited bribes.

Acting on AP's report, the IAAF said Wednesday it has passed Sakari and Manunga's allegations to the ethics commission. The World Anti-Doping Agency said it is ""most disturbed"" by the allegations that sound ""eerily similar"" to other recent revelations of doping cover-ups in athletics, mostly focused on Russia, and said it would seek more information to determine if it should investigate.

Sakari and Manunga, both police officers in Kenya, said Mwangi asked them for 2.5 million Kenyan shillings -- or $24,000 -- each.

""I told him I've never seen that much money in my life,"" Manunga told AP. ""Even if I sold everything, I wouldn't be able to get together that amount of money.""

The athletes tested positive in August for furosemide, a diuretic banned because it can mask the use of forbidden performance-enhancers, and were sent home from the worlds in Beijing. They told AP the drug was sold to them by a chemist in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, who said it would alleviate side effects of supplements they were taking. The chemist testified in defense of the athletes to AK, saying he gave them furosemide to combat water-retention caused by the supplement.

Compared to doping cases involving other athletes, their four-year bans appear harsh. World Anti-Doping Agency rules classify furosemide as a so-called ""specified substance,"" distinguishing it from hardcore performance-enhancers like steroids or the blood-boosting hormone EPO.

For specified substances, IAAF rules allow for lesser bans of no more than two years, or even just a reprimand and no ban, if athletes can prove they weren't at fault or negligent.

To impose a four-year ban, the rules require authorities to establish that athletes intentionally cheated. But AK appears to have discounted the chemist's testimony. In the letter it sent to Manunga announcing her ban, AK said there was no ""plausible explanation"" for using furosemide and that the federation ""can only infer"" she took it intentionally as a masking agent.

Last year, Serbia's athletics federation imposed a two-year ban on 800-meter runner Nemanja Kojic for the same substance. He can return to competition in 2017; Sakari and Manunga were banned until 2019.

They said they visited Mwangi's first-floor office together, seeking news of their case. During that meeting, they said, he asked for the bribe, dangling the possibility of shaving time off their bans.

Both athletes say they are sure of the date of that meeting -- Oct. 16 -- because, they say, they went to the KCB bank together later that day to open accounts and deposit 600,000 Kenya shillings ($5,785) paid to each of them for being on Kenya's team at the IAAF's world relays meet in the Bahamas in May.

""He was waiting for us to give him money, so that this `thing' disappears,"" Manunga said. ""We left, kept quiet and later that's when our names came out and we were told that we've been banned because we did not deliver that money.""

""He asked us if we could give him something. That's what he said,"" said Sakari. ""He asked for money.""

Mwangi denied that he met privately with the athletes.

""Why we avoid those kinds of things is because we know athletes are fond of making any kind of claim,"" he told AP.

""It is not possible to give anyone money to meddle with your case,"" he added. ""I will contact the athletes officially and I will ask the athletes to come, the two of them, and like I said they are police officers, so we will have to involve the police force.""

Soliciting a bribe is a crime in Kenya.

The athletes have told their story privately to the Professional Athletics Association of Kenya, an advocacy group of Kenyan runners. The association's secretary, Julius Ndegwa, said Sakari and Manunga came to see him and a lawyer in January.

The athletes spoke to AP in an on-camera interview in Embu, a ramshackle town 130 kilometers (80 miles) northeast of Nairobi where they were housed in police accommodation.

Sakari also raced at the 2012 London Olympics and 2009 worlds. In Beijing, she competed under the name Zakary, but Sakari is her preferred spelling. She indicated that she is now done with athletics, because she will be 33 when her ban expires.

Manunga, 23, said she would have paid to return sooner to competition.

""For me, those four years are too many,"" she said. ""If I had the money, I'd have paid. But I didn't have it. So I just left.""",[]
espn.com,,ESPN men's pound-for-pound rankings,['Brett Okamoto'],"Who is the world's best men's mixed martial artist, regardless of weight class? My latest top 10 rankings are listed below, and two featherweights made the list.

In addition, here are my women's pound-for-pound rankings.

Note: Results through March 8.

= champion

1. Demetrious Johnson

Record: 23-2-1

Div.: Flyweight (UFC)

Last: W (UD) John Dodson, Sept. 5, 2015

Next: UFC 197 on April 23, vs. Henry Cejudo

Any way you slice it, Johnson has proven himself as the No. 1 pound-for-pound fighter in the world. He is head and shoulders above the rest of the 125-pound division, which is arguably the most technical weight class in the sport. ""Mighty Mouse"" is king.

2. Jon Jones

Record: 21-1

Div.: Light heavyweight (UFC)

Last: W (UD5) Daniel Cormier, Jan. 3, 2015

Next: UFC 197 on April 23, vs. Daniel Cormier

Jones made history in 2015 when he became the first UFC champion to lose a title due to a violation of the company's code of conduct. The UFC has since reinstated the polarizing former champ. He looks forward to ""taking back what's his"" in 2016.

3. Luke Rockhold

Record: 15-2

Div.: Middleweight (UFC)

Last: W (TKO4) Chris Weidman, Dec. 12, 2015

Next: UFC 199 on June 4, vs. Chris Weidman

Rockhold has long referred to himself as the No. 1 middleweight in the sport and now has the hardware to prove it. Strikeforce belt. UFC belt. Life is good at the top.

4. Dominick Cruz

Record: 21-1

Div.: Bantamweight (UFC)

Last: W (UD5) TJ Dillashaw, Jan. 17, 2016

Next: UFC 199 on June 4, vs. Urijah Faber

Cruz has just two wins in the last two years, but that stat has nothing to do with how effective he is in the cage. When he's healthy, he's one of the best. That's been true for years, despite the injury layoffs.

5. Rafael dos Anjos

Record: 25-7

Div.: Lightweight (UFC)

Last: W (TKO1) Donald Cerrone, Dec. 19, 2015

Next: TBD

Time to stop overlooking dos Anjos, who has now won 10 of 11, including victories against Cerrone (twice), Anthony Pettis and Benson Henderson. He has suffered just one loss in three years.

6. TJ Dillashaw

Record: 12-3

Div.: Bantamweight (UFC)

Last: L (UD5) Dominick Cruz, Jan. 17, 2016

Next: TBD

Dillashaw's first win against Renan Barao didn't look like a fluke and he removed all doubt about that by dominating the former champion a second time in a rematch. A fight against Dominick Cruz is must-see at 135 pounds.

7. Frankie Edgar

Record: 20-4-1

Div.: Featherweight (UFC)

Last: W (KO1) Chad Mendes, Dec. 11, 2015

Next: TBD

No stranger to the pound-for-pound list, Edgar seems to be getting even better with age. He's on an absolute tear as a featherweight. Wins over BJ Penn, Cub Swanson, Urijah Faber and Chad Mendes haven't been close.

8. Robbie Lawler

Record: 27-10

Div.: Welterweight (UFC)

Last: W (SD) Carlos Condit, Jan. 2, 2016

Next: TBD

It's never easy, but Lawler won his third consecutive UFC welterweight title fight in January, narrowly defeating Carlos Condit in a fight that could have gone either way on the scorecards. It's a crazy 170-pound division, but Lawler has established himself at the top of it.

9. Conor McGregor

Record: 19-3

Div.: Featherweight (UFC)

Last: L (Sub2) Nate Diaz, March 5, 2016

Next: TBD

McGregor finally bit off more than he could chew in the form of a 170-pound non-title fight against Nate Diaz. He's still No. 1 in his 145-pound weight class though and very likely dangerous at 155. He doesn't fall too far with this loss.

10. Jose Aldo

Record: 25-2

Div.: Featherweight (UFC)

Last: L (KO1) McGregor, Dec. 12, 2015

Next: TBD

Arguably one of the most overlooked champions in this sport, Aldo suffered a heart-wrenching 13-second loss to Conor McGregor under the brightest spotlight he's ever been under. He's in an unfamiliar spot, the losing column, for the first time in 10 years.",[]
espn.com,,More beer mile drama is on tap in Austin,"['Roger Robinson', 'Greg Garber', 'Sarah Gearhart']","The Beer Mile World Classic in San Francisco featured the greatest field the sport has ever gathered. Four beers and one mile later, Canadian Lewis Kent emerged as the champion. ESPN's Greg Garber reports. (2:41)

Every nuanced, excruciating moment in the wonderful world of the beer mile is right there to see in online video.

And so, after Corey Gallagher broke the world record in October with a sizzling 4 minutes, 54.4 seconds, fellow Canadian Lewis Kent broke down the splits necessary to regain it with a marker right on his refrigerator.

Then the 21-year-old student at the University of Western Ontario went out on Nov. 17 and did it, almost to the second: 69, 74, 76, 73 = 4:51.9.

""Honestly,"" said Kent, who quaffed Amsterdam Blonde, ""I wasn't that surprised.""

Neither was Gallagher, who held the record (set with Bud Light Platinum) for a little over five weeks.

""He's not a serious, serious runner,"" said Gallagher, a Manitoba postman, not unkindly. ""But he's starting to grasp the little tricks you need to go fast. He's seeing the light.""

There could be fireworks on Tuesday night in Austin, Texas, where the world's two fastest beer milers ever will collide -- perhaps even literally -- at the second annual Flotrack Beer Mile World Championship, which will be broadcast live at Flotrack.org.

""Having No. 1 and No. 2 compete head-to-head for the first time is going to be awesome,"" said Max Crutchfield, FloSports' director of owned events. ""The course is going to be faster this year. I think the record's going to fall.""

The next level

Patrick Butler was enjoying a fancy dinner in Manhattan with his fiance, Christina, when Kent texted him 30 minutes after he posted the most recent record-breaking video.

""Is it official?"" Kent asked the proprietor of www.beermile.com.

""Politically, I was not in a great position,"" Butler said. ""But I snuck away, verified the video on my phone and posted it on Facebook. It was about 3 a.m. that same night when I got it up on the website.

""Just when you think the beer mile has crested, the record falls again. I think it became next-level for me when my mom forwarded me a link. There was a story on ""Ellen."" When sponsors start to get involved, we're in a new place.""

Indeed, Kent -- a decent college cross country runner -- is a paid spokesman for Brooks, the running shoe and apparel company. Yes, he's being compensated nicely to drink a 12-ounce beer (at least 5 percent alcohol), run a quarter mile, then repeat the process three more times.

""I don't know the exact amount, but I'm sure it's great for a college kid,"" said Butler, who ran cross country at Wesleyan University. ""One of of the big winners is Brooks; I can see in this single blast of media they probably made their money back.

""It's kind of genius on their part to embrace this. Beers companies are still off limits -- they don't want to be seen as encouraging binge-drinking. But I can see other possibilities down the road.""

Actually, it's Gallagher who was the first sponsored beer miler. Under Armour paid him to wear their gear a year ago in Austin.

A few more seconds?

Gallagher is the defending Flotrack champion. He ran five minutes flat last December on the sprawling Formula 1 track outside Austin. It remains the fastest beer mile time recorded in an actual sanctioned race.

Memorably, Gallagher's post-race rant about the legitimacy of James ""The Beast"" Nielsen's then-world record caused a stir on social media. When Nielsen invited Gallagher to his Beer Mile Classic in San Francisco back in August, Gallagher declined. Naturally, Nielsen won't be on hand next Tuesday.

This time around, the 28-year-old Gallagher is stirring things up again. A week before he broke Kent's record on Oct. 10 at the University of Manitoba, Gallagher claims he ran a 4:52.

""The video wasn't good, so I waited and ran it again a week later,"" Gallagher said. ""I had to ease back -- it was almost too fast.""

Kent says a friend told him about that alleged 4:52.

""Whether it's true or not isn't relevant,"" he said, laughing. ""We'll find out who's faster in Texas.""

Gallagher said he's saving himself for Austin, where the incentive for a world record is $2,500.

""I feel like there's a little bit in the tank,"" Gallagher said. ""Hopefully, it will translate. I know I have a few more seconds in me, for sure.""

Beer Mile World Classic delivers excitement The inaugural World Beer Mile Classic didn't produce a world record, but the best beer milers in the world put on a good show that included a dramatic ending to the team competition. 1 Related

This year, Nielsen has seen the record he set in April 2014 broken four times, by three different men. The 35-year-old says he's okay with this.

""I'm actually surprised that my world record lasted as long as it did,"" he said from his California home. ""There was an incredible amount of publicity that came from breaking five minutes. Those back-to-back records by the Canadian guys -- that's great.

""It's definitely got me excited to get the record back. I better hurry up and do it. I'm getting a little older, and these guys are in their running prime.""

Nielsen, who set his record in the vacuum of an empty track at a local community college, did not fare well in his home race this summer. He would have finished sixth -- if he hadn't been disqualified for having too much beer left in his cans.

At the same race, former world-record holder Josh Harris also met with misfortune, spewing the contents of his stomach and being assessed the mandatory penalty lap.

It raised a question about the effect of a competitive field on beer milers. Does it enhance performance, or does the presence of opponents and a roaring crowd make it more difficult for athletes to chug and run?

The definitive answer could come Tuesday. The course is being set up in downtown Austin, in a parking lot at the American-Statesman newspaper.

""It's a really cool venue,"" said FloSport's Crutchfield. ""We're planning on a big crowd, hoping for 5,000. We'll have three of the top five men in the world and six of the top 10.""

On the women's side, it will be two of the top three, with former world-record holder Chris Kimbrough, a mother of six from Austin, and 2014's second-place finisher, Andrea Fisher. Both women have run 6:28, just 11 seconds off the world record set a year ago by Beth Herndon.

Admission to the event is free, and spectators are encouraged to run in the preliminary heats. The elite races are scheduled to begin at 8:30 p.m. local time, with the men set to go off at 8:55.

How will it go?

Some predictions:

Butler: ""I'm not sure we'll see a world record. It's the same reason you rarely see a world record at the Olympics. The guys are going to be in a headspace where they're more concerned about winning than their time. Still, the talent will be there. If the conditions present themselves, it's possible.""

Nielsen: ""Lewis is coming off his cross country season. He'll be in better shape to break the world record. But will the course be up to it? Ultimately, the media wants to see a world record, but I guarantee the athletes want the win. I think you'll see a cat and mouse game, elbow to elbow. No one wants to rabbit a world record and get out-kicked at the end. ""

Kent: ""There's a chance you'll see a record. I'm really looking forward to it.""

Gallagher: ""I think it will come down to one of us two. It will depend on the setup they have in that parking lot and the conditions. If feel I have a shot [at the record], I'm going to go for it.""",[]
espn.com,,"Adam Scott, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy will go to Rio 2016 if they qualify","['Gordon Simpson', 'Bob Harig', 'Michael Collins', 'Pa Sport', 'Jason Sobel']","Rumours, doubts and speculation about the top players' desire to compete in golf's return to the Olympics has cast a shadow over the event that was last seen at the Games in 1904.

Adam Scott, the winner of the WGC-Cadillac Championship last weekend, has certainly made his aversion to the sport's inclusion clear, and the suspicion has been that he was voicing the feelings of many of his peers.

But the man charged with overseeing golf's Olympics comeback has claimed that big-name players such as Scott, Jordan Spieth -- who has sounded excited about the event -- Jason Day and Rory McIlroy would not only go to Rio, but see all the personal and commercial opportunities of doing so, too.

With Tuesday's test event at Barra da Tijuca approaching, Antony Scanlon, a blunt, no-nonsense Australian and the International Golf Federation's (IGF) executive director, said of the sport's stars: ""They are going to be there [in Rio de Janeiro]. Any athlete who qualifies will be there.

""They see the significance of this event to golf and for the opportunity this presents them. There are benefits to be gained from participation and winning a medal. For a starter, there is a television audience of 3.6bn. They don't normally get that every weekend!

""There is exposure to markets and people who have never seen golf, or had exposure to golf. That is the uniqueness of broadcasting an Olympic sport.

Antony Scanlon has insisted the world's top golfers will appear at Rio 2016. CFP/Getty Images for IGF

""Around 60 or 70 percent of the people who are watching would not normally be watching that sport week in, week out. That is the opportunity the Olympic Games bring to golf, and it's the opportunity the Games brings to the players -- that exposure they would not normally get. From that, all of us [in golf] will benefit.""

Scanlon readily identified with the growing tremor of excitement in professional golf surrounding the keen rivalry between the world's leading three players: Spieth, Day and McIlroy -- and let's not forget Rickie Fowler is hammering down the door to make it a fabulous foursome.

""It's true there are some fantastic rivalries"" he said. ""But it's not just on the men's tours. It's the same on the women's side as well with Lydia Ko and Inbee Park and others involved. There are some great players out there.

""There is a similar rivalry between, probably, the top 10 in each ranking. Any one of them can win on their day and the sport has never looked stronger at the elite level. We will see that desire to win come Rio, I'm sure.""

Scanlon has seen negative comments from leading players during the wearisomely long build-up from the announcement of golf's inclusion, which took place in Copenhagen seven years ago, to the cusp of modern Olympic competition.

But he claimed the intelligence he has gathered, from a number of key sources within the game, provided reassurance that the return from the Olympic wilderness will be an overwhelming success.

Scanlon, who took on the IGF role in 2010 charged with promoting golf as an Olympic sport, has never felt any need to engage in one-to-one conversations with the top players as a means of coaxing them to play on the brand new Gil Hanse-designed Barra de Tijuca course, which is situated close to the beating heart of Rio.

Adam Scott has been among the critics of golf's inclusion in the Olympics. Stan Badz/PGA TOUR

""There has been no real need to get out in front of the athletes and address any concerns -- because there aren't any,"" he said. ""We have an 'athletes' commission' which includes Park and Karrie Webb from the women's side and Henrik Stenson and Thongchai Jaidee from the men's.

""All four are influences within the locker room and there is nothing we are hearing from them, along the lines of: 'hey, we need to reach out to these guys'.

""Similarly, we have tour liaison officers as part of the athletes' committee who dial in [for a conference call] every Friday and all we are hearing is enthusiasm from them, week in week out. The message is that the players are keen to be there and looking forward to it.""

What is indisputable is that the golfing calendar has become a tangled maze of major championship golf across the male and female schedules in 2016. The Open Championship at Royal Troon will back onto the PGA Championship at Baltusrol in July, with only seven days separating the two majors.

The women's British Open will be played at Woburn from July 28-21 -- the same week as the PGA in New Jersey -- with both those majors feeding directly into the Olympic competitions in Rio. The 72-hole men's event is staged first from August 11-14, with the women's contest following after a two-day interval.

Scanlon took the philosophical view. He said: ""The feedback from players and their agents is that they will work around it and fit their playing schedules into the schedule. They will peak in the events they want to peak in.

""The feedback from players and their agents is that they will work around it. They will peak in the events they want to peak in."" Antony Scanlon

""That's one of the commitments we gave to the IOC when we were bidding to get golf back into the Games -- that we would ensure that the top players would be there and we had assurances from all the agencies running the majors that there won't be a conflict with the Olympic Games.""

Nine Brazilian male and female professionals were due to compete in the Test event on Tuesday (March 8) to assess the playability of the course and the scoring system devised for the 60-strong fields in August.

Scanlon was hopeful that the final entry would be broadly representative of as many countries as possible, and not just the nations customarily exposed to the game.

But what about the format, which has come in for some stick already because it doesn't make any allowances for team competition, mixed events or match play?

""The IOC directive was that the Olympic Games is not a place to experiment on format. In effect, they said to come back later if you want to experiment, having proven that some other format works,"" he said.

""We canvassed the players' opinions and they were pretty clear that stroke play was their preference. When you add that to the IOC's desire for it to be stroke play, we really didn't have much choice. Let's get through Rio. Let's see how many excitement is generated around the world -- and then we will look to see if we need to change for Tokyo 2020.""",[]
espn.com,,Cycling official worries Olympic velodrome won't be ready for Rio test event,"['Johnette Howard', 'Espn Staff', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Adriana Terrazas', 'Bonnie D']","LONDON -- With five months to go before the start of the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, the president of cycling's world governing body said Saturday that getting the velodrome ready in time for the test event at the end of April will be ""a challenge.""

A new construction company has been appointed to finish the velodrome with organizers confident the test event -- which had already been pushed back -- will take place between April 29 and May 1.

UCI president Brian Cookson is confident the track will be ready for the Olympics but he expressed his concern about the test event with less than eight weeks to go.

""We are assured by the Rio organizing committee that the dates 29th April to 1st of May will still be deliverable but I think that's a challenge,"" Cookson told reporters at the track cycling world championships in London. ""I understand that the contractors are on site now with timber and everything is ready to roll. They might have started in the last 24 hours.""

With the building almost completed, focus is on installation of the track.

""You have to be assured when you're putting in Siberian timber that the conditions in there are absolutely perfect,"" Cookson said. ""The air conditioning needs to be in place and operational, the moisture control, the dampness needs to be under control because the last thing we want when the track is built is the timber going in and warping and bending.""

He added: ""I have no doubt there will be a velodrome ready and functional to the required standards for the Olympic Games. The contingency plan is to have the Olympic Games in Rio and to have a track ready and finished. There is no alternative. That's the straight answer.""

Cookson was also asked about the sport's approach to mechanical fraud after a motor was found concealed in a bike frame during the cyclo-cross world championships in January.

Cookson said he expects the disciplinary commission to hear the case within the next month with the UCI asking for stiff penalties.

""The regulation is deliberately quite loosely drawn so the minimum of a six-month suspension would not be appropriate for a motor in a bike. Someone using a motor in a bike -- that's a very, very serious level of technological fraud and will attract an appropriate penalty.""

To combat technological doping, the UCI has developed a system which allows them to scan bike frames before and possibly even during races.

Two hundred bikes, including those of all medalists, will have been tested at the current track championships.

While cycling has been in the spotlight in the recent past for doping, attention is now on track and field with Russia banned from international competition.

""We are getting co-operation from Russia, the cycling anti-doping foundation is,"" Cookson said.

""I know the Russian federation and the Russian anti-doping agency has itself taken action recently against some cyclists in Russia so I am confident they again will live up to their commitments to us and to the World Anti-Doping Agency. If they don't they will fall foul of the regulations just like anybody else whether its British, French, German American, Russian, Australian, anybody.""

Cookson also announced the 2017 track cycling world championships will be held in Hong Kong from April 12-16.",[]
espn.com,,UFC president Dana White -- I feel bad for Holly Holm,['Brett Okamoto'],"UFC president Dana White never liked the idea of Holly Holm taking a fight before a potential rematch against Ronda Rousey.

White's concern played out last weekend, when Holm (10-1) suffered her first professional loss via fifth-round submission to Miesha Tate at UFC 196 in Las Vegas. The loss cost Holm the UFC's bantamweight championship, which she won in November by knocking out Rousey.

According to White, the UFC is now eyeing a third fight between Tate (18-5) and Rousey (12-1) later this year, and he blames Holm's longtime manager, Lenny Fresquez, for the divisional shakeup.

""The sad part about that is, listen, he's an old boxing guy who thinks he's smart, and he's not,"" White said during an appearance on ESPN's Russillo & Kanell. ""It's one of those things. I feel bad about it. I feel bad for Holly. I don't know if Holly really knows what she lost. I think she has so much faith in the people that surround her, she feels like, 'Well, they got me this far.'

""We had this meeting, and Holly wasn't even in it. Holly, that's your life. You should be in that meeting. Don't leave it to these people. Anyway, Holly made a lot of money. She accomplished great things, she beat Ronda Rousey. But it could have been so much bigger for her, and the sad part is, I don't think she even knows it.""

When contacted by ESPN.com, Fresquez said Holm was well aware of the risk she took.

""Of course, she knows,"" Fresquez said. ""It was a team decision, and Holly is the boss. She wanted to fight, and she got her wish. I think she'll fight Miesha or Ronda next. That's my personal feeling, but who knows what the UFC has cooking? Holly was dominant in that fight against Miesha except for the second and fifth round. She paid for it. Hat's off to Miesha for capitalizing.

""What happens next is the UFC's decision. All I can speak to are Holly's wishes. Holly wants to fight Miesha right away. She wants to fight Ronda Rousey. Even with the title, a fight between Miesha and Rousey doesn't have the glamour a fight with Holly and Ronda does. Yeah, Holly lost. She made a mistake, but she'll learn from it. Everyone saw she's a warrior.""

""The sad part about that is, listen, he's an old boxing guy who thinks he's smart and he's not. It's one of those things, I feel bad about it. I feel bad for Holly. I don't know if Holly really knows what she lost. I think she has so much faith in the people that surround her, she feels like, 'Well, they got me this far.'"" Dana White on Holly Holm's manager Lenny Fresquez

Before UFC 196, Holm told ESPN.com she had been willing to accept an immediate rematch against Rousey but was worried the earliest it would happen would be fall. Holm, 34, wasn't willing to wait that long.

Regarding the overall health of the UFC following the losses by two of its stars, Holm and featherweight champion Conor McGregor, White didn't seem too worried.

""Do you know how long I've listened to people talk, 'What are you guys gonna do when Chuck Liddell leaves? What are you gonna do when [Georges St-Pierre] goes?'"" White said. ""This is a fight promotion. There's always somebody super talented coming down the pipeline, man. It's always been that way, and it will always be that way.""",[]

Below, we'll look at the best, worst and most controversial moments of the year, along with the usual betting report from Week 15 in the NFL.

The good

The 2015 NCAA tournament was, by far, the greatest March Madness that MGM vice president of race and sports Jay Rood had ever experienced.

""The first three days were just phenomenal,"" Rood said. ""If we needed a 92-percent free throw shooter to miss them both, he did.""

Rood estimated his book held between ""12 and 15 percent"" of the amount wagered over the first three days of the tournament. The book almost won too much, too early.

""One day, I think it was the first Friday, we held like 26 percent,"" Rood said. ""Sunday was basically zero. Everyone's will was broken by that point.""

-- Floyd Mayweather's victory over Manny Pacquiao in May produced the biggest win on a single event from both William Hill and CG Technology's Nevada sportsbooks.

""We needed Mayweather, over 11.5 [rounds] and to win by decision,"" Jason Simbal, CG Technology vice president of race and sports, said. ""And we got them all.""

Simbal characterized the win as on the ""higher side of the six-figure range.""

-- The most profitable NFL game of the 2015 regular season for Caesars sportsbook came in Week 1. On Monday night, after a slew of favorites buried the books on the opening Sunday, the San Francisco 49ers upset the Minnesota Vikings as 2.5-point underdogs.

""The public had a good opening Sunday and many rolled it onto the Vikings figuring with [Adrian Peterson] back, they'd level them,"" a Caesars bookmanager said. ""Well, that didn't happen, and we cleaned up, making back everything we had paid out Sunday and then some.""

-- The Houston Texans' Monday night upset of the then-undefeated Cincinnati Bengals on Nov. 16 produced a mid-six-figure win for CG Technology, the book's biggest win of the NFL season through Week 15.

The costly

-- The Super Bowl drama still stings for William Hill director of trading Nick Bogdanovich. The Seattle Seahawks' decision to attempt a pass on second-and-goal from the New England 1-yard line, down 28-24, with 27 seconds to play, produced a million-dollar swing at William Hill, when Patriots defensive back Malcolm Butler cut in front of the slant and picked off Russell Wilson to secure the win. It was the sportsbook's largest single-game loss in 2015.

""Horrible call,"" Bogdanovich lamented. ""Just another seven figures that we can't get back.""

-- The Carolina Panthers' 33-14 blowout of the Dallas Cowboys on Thanksgiving Day produced the biggest loss on an NFL game for CG Technology.

""We had a guy bet $700,000 on the Panthers,"" Simbal said.

-- Caesars' biggest loss on an NFL game came in Week 8, when the Arizona Cardinals covered as 7-point favorites in a 34-20 win over the Cleveland Browns.

The controversial

-- You wouldn't guess a College World Series game would cause the biggest kerfuffle of the year for Caesars sportsbook. But a weather-hampered game between Fullerton and Vanderbilt that started on June 14 -- but didn't end until June 15 -- did exactly that.

With Fullerton leading 3-1 in the sixth inning, rain moved in, causing the game to be suspended and restarted Saturday. Vanderbilt came from behind on Saturday and won 4-3 on a walk-off home run. But, per house rules, games that go five innings are deemed official, and so the book ruled Fullerton the winner.

-- Western Kentucky's lopsided 63-7 rout of Florida International on Nov. 21 looked to be an easy winner for Hilltopper backers, as WKU led 56-0 heading into the fourth quarter as 20-point favorites. But the game was called with 5:03 to play due to lightning in the area. Per sportsbook rules, football games must last 55 minutes to be official. All bets were ruled no action; at CG Technology, 80 percent of the bets were on Western Kentucky.

Week 15 NFL betting report

Nevada sportsbooks' three-peat is in jeopardy.

The state's regulated sports betting market has set records in both the amount bet and the amount won by the books the past two years. But heading into the final football weekend of 2015, the books are going to need a strong finish to set another mark -- especially after yesterday.

Heavily-bet favorites Seattle, Green Bay and Pittsburgh came through for bettors in an afternoon barrage that sucked up the books' morning profits -- and more. Arizona's primetime shredding of Philadelphia finished off the books and sent bettors into the holidays in a festive mood. NFL PickCenter Wondering which side to take?

""The worst [of the year] was today,"" Marc Nelson, sportsbook director at the Aliante Casino, said. ""Brutal day for cards, parlays and teasers.""

Hold off on your charitable donations to the bookies for now, though. With November and December profits yet to be announced, sportsbooks are up $170.4 million in 2015, according to Nevada Gaming Control. The books won a record $227.04 million in 2014, breaking the all-time record that had been set in 2013 by $25 million, and catching that mark this year is certainly plausible. (The books won $58 million in November and December last year).

Overall in 2015, though, bettors have bet more and lost less in than in recent years.

""The handle is good, but the win percentage is a little bit less this year,"" CG Technology's Simbal said.

Through October, $3.24 billion has been wagered at Nevada's 188 regulated sportsbooks in 2015; approximately $3.90 billion was bet in 2014.

The books kept 5.82 percent of the amount wagered last year; in 2015, the books have held approximately 5.24 percent of the amount wagered through October. (Nevada Gaming Control will release revenue numbers for November in the coming weeks, followed by December numbers in late January).

""Honestly, most of the football season has been a boring type [of] year for us,"" Westgate SuperBook assistant manager Ed Salmons said. ""We have grinded our way to a decent season.""",[]
espn.com,,Make-or-break seasons: Players on the spot in the National League,"['Jerry Crasnick', 'David Schoenfield', 'Stacey Gotsulias']","We did make-or-break players to watch in the American League, so let's do the same for the National League.

How can you predict how these guys will do? You can't. They're all lottery tickets, capable of excellent value or no value or somewhere in-between. They're the kind of players you need to hit on to win a fantasy league -- or the players who need to step up if their team is going to make the postseason.

NL East

Atlanta Braves -- Manny Banuelos, LHP

A lot of young players will get a shot with the Braves this year -- heck, Bud Norris is listed as the No. 2 starter on the team's website -- and Banuelos is still trying to recover the luster he once had as a prospect with the New York Yankees. I remember watching him in a spring training game a few years ago and his stuff was nasty. However, he had trouble throwing strikes and then he got injured. He's probably a reliever in the long run, but he has a chance to break camp in the rotation.

After hitting 23 home runs in 2014, Marcell Ozuna had just 10 homers last season. David Santiago/El Nuevo Herald/Getty Images

Miami Marlins -- Marcell Ozuna, OF

He had a 4.5-WAR season in 2014 and then ended up back in the minors in 2015. The Marlins said it was because he was in a 1-for-36 slump. Agent Scott Boras said the Marlins were preventing Ozuna from being eligible for salary arbitration. Ozuna likened his time in Triple-A to ""jail."" Then he was mentioned in trade rumors all offseason. Oh boy.

New York Mets -- Addison Reed, RHP

The Mets don't have an obvious ""make or break"" kind of player, so let's put Reed on the spot. Because the White Sox anointed him their closer when he was a rookie in 2012 and he has saved more than 100 games, he's making $5.3 million and there is the perception that he's a good reliever when ... well, he has a career 4.01 ERA. In the past four seasons, 73 pitchers have thrown at least 200 innings in relief and Reed ranks 68th in ERA. That doesn't mean he's bad -- the bad relievers don't stick around to throw 50-plus innings every season -- but he's going to be in a pressure role as a key setup guy for the Mets.

Philadelphia Phillies -- Jeremy Hellickson, RHP

The AL Rookie of the Year with Tampa Bay in 2011, Hellickson posted a 3.02 ERA through his first two seasons. Analysts said there was a lot of luck in his numbers -- BABIP, strand rate -- as he had a 4.52 FIP. Maybe the critics were right as he owns a 4.86 ERA over the past three seasons (he missed time in 2014 after elbow surgery). He moves on to his third team in three seasons ...

Washington Nationals -- Tanner Roark, RHP

Who is the real Tanner Roark? The one who posted a 2.85 ERA and 5.1 WAR in 2014 or the one who posted a 4.38 ERA and ended up in the bullpen in 2015? With the departures of Jordan Zimmermann and Doug Fister he's back in the rotation. Something weird to watch: His groundball rate was actually 7 percent higher in 2015 and yet his home run rate nearly doubled. In 2014, 6.8 percent of the fly balls he allowed went for home runs; in 2015, it jumped to 10.8 percent. The MLB average in 2015 was 11.4 percent, so Roark will need to find a way to get even more grounders given his low strikeout rate.

NL Central

Chicago Cubs -- Javier Baez, IF

This one's a little unfair as Baez is unlikely to have a regular role unless somebody among the Cubs' regulars gets injured. You can even argue he should play every day in the minors, but the Cubs are trying to win and he's their best backup option in the infield. Manager Joe Maddon loves him; it's just an issue of finding him enough playing time so he doesn't get rusty and strike out twice a game when he does start.

Cincinnati Reds -- Billy Hamilton, CF

A classic make-or-break season: A young player who was good enough as a rookie in 2014 (especially when factoring in speed and defense), but hit just .226/.274/.289 in 2015. That's not good enough to remain a starter.

Milwaukee Brewers -- Wily Peralta, RHP

He missed time with an oblique strain in 2015, but that doesn't explain away his 4.72 ERA in 20 starts with poor peripherals across the board. He relies on a power sinker, but it wasn't sinking much in 2015 and batters hit his fastball (four-seamer plus sinker) for a .340/.396/.525 line and his overall strikeout rate plummeted from 18.4 percent to 12.6 percent. I was skeptical that his 17-win season in 2014 was a true breakout and now he has to show the Brewers he's a guy they can build a rotation around.

Pittsburgh Pirates -- Jeff Locke, LHP

An All-Star in 2013 after he had a big first half, Locke has seen his ERA rise from 3.52 to 3.91 to 4.49. An already thin rotation is depending on Locke to have a bounce-back season. If not, rookies Tyler Glasnow and Jameson Taillon are waiting in the wings. Locke's strikeout and groundball rates have actually remained consistent and he's cut down on his walk rate, so his year-to-year fluctuation has mostly been about stranding runners: He was good (or lucky) in 2013 and poor (or unlucky) in 2015.

St. Louis Cardinals -- Matt Adams, 1B

Coming off a big postseason in 2014 when he hit three home runs -- including the game-winning blast off Clayton Kershaw in Game 4 of the Division Series -- the Cardinals expected Adams to be a primary power source for 2015. Instead, he tore a quad muscle and missed four months. The home run against Kershaw notwithstanding, Adams is a career .197 hitter against lefties so he needs a platoon partner anyway. Plus he's now battling Brandon Moss (another lefty hitter) for playing time.

NL West

Arizona Diamondbacks -- Jean Segura, SS/2B

He made the NL All-Star team with the Brewers in 2013 after having a monster first half, but he hasn't hit since. He's gone from 42 extra-base hits in 2013 to just 27 last season as he's become an extreme groundball hitter. It doesn't help that he swings at everything (he had the worst walk rate of any regular in 2015) and his defense isn't so good to carry his bat. The Diamondbacks will try him at second base along with shortstop, but his future appears to be as a utility player.

Colorado Rockies -- Jordan Lyles, RHP

I feel guilty criticizing any Rockies pitcher, but Lyles now owns a career 5.14 ERA in 97 major league starts and he missed the final four months of last season after having toe surgery. Given the Rockies' new emphasis on fastball velocity and Lyles' average-ish 92.0 mph heater, his spot in the rotation is tenuous.

Los Angeles Dodgers -- Yasiel Puig, RF

This one isn't quite like the others, but Puig certainly has a lot at stake in 2016. The Dodgers will put up with his antics if he produces like he did in 2013 and 2014, but not if he hits .255/.322/.436 again and spends half of the season on the disabled list. New Dodgers manager Dave Roberts could be a huge help, and I'm predicting Puig bounces back with an All-Star season.

San Diego Padres -- Wil Myers, 1B

Myers has played just 147 games over the past two seasons -- he had injuries to both wrists -- so his big thing is staying on the field in order to regain the batting stroke that won him AL rookie honors with the Rays in 2013. Was he overhyped as a prospect? Maybe a bit, but at various times he's hit for power, shown some patience at the plate and he did hit .293 as a rookie. He's also moving to first base on a regular basis after starting 19 games there in 2015, so there's even more pressure for him to produce offensively.

San Francisco Giants -- Hunter Strickland, RHP

The Giants are mostly a team of veterans or young veterans who have already proven themselves. The bullpen that has been around forever is finally starting to show some age -- Jeremy Affeldt retired, Santiago Casilla is 35, Sergio Romo is 33 -- so Strickland has a chance to become a primary setup guy after he had a pretty good rookie season in 2015. Those home runs he allowed in the 2014 postseason will linger in the minds of Giants fans, but Strickland could be a future closer if Casilla or Romo falter.",[]
espn.com,,Fantasy baseball rankings reaction,[],"After two days of ranking baseball's best, Eric Karabell and Tristan H. Cockcroft regroup to discuss the hits and misses during the Fantasy Baseball Rankings Summit. From arguing about the No. 1 overall pick to highlighting a few players that didn't get enough love, this version if Insider Premium Audio brings fantasy baseball players up to speed before drafts begin in just a few weeks.

Topics include:

 Both Karabell and Cockcroft are buyers are Mike Trout, but one is more sold on his 2013 potential than the other.

 Evaluating the top three: Ryan Braun, Trout and Miguel Cabrera. Where will each regress this season?

 Karabell wants more power at first base than Joey Votto and was surprised that he's in the top 10 overall.

 Do the guys have any concern about Albert Pujols this season?

 Karabell and Cockcroft genuinely disagree about Bryce Harper's potential this season. Cockcroft reminds Harper buyers to be patient.

 Why did some rankers give up on some of the more popular fantasy players from 2012?

 Matt Holliday's overall draft position confused the group and Karabell believes he's too low.

 Cockcroft uses the rankings to go round-by-round of who he'd pick in each spot, preaching a balanced approach to drafting.

 The catcher pool for 2013 is very risk-reward oriented. Karabell questions why Buster Posey ended up in the top 20.

 Who are the four aces you can count on in the second round? Cockcroft says you need an ace this year, Karabell disagrees. Both highlight names late in the draft to target.

 Craig Kimbrel's ranking at 44 is surprising and both offer closer draft strategy. Cockcroft explains why Kimbrel may an exception to the standard play of waiting.

 Karabell argues the room had a bias toward middle relievers during the rankings. Which pitchers surprised him?

 Should you draft one of the younger prospects (like Shelby Miller, Dylan Bundy) or wait and pick them up during the season?

 As a fantasy owner, what should you be doing in February to prepare?",[]
espn.com,,"Anaheim Ducks, Tampa Bay Lightning take same road back to contender status","['Pierre Lebrun', 'Dan Marrazza', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Sean Allen', 'John Buccigross', 'Scott Burnside', 'Paul Grant']","From stunning first-half struggles to re-births as real Stanley Cup contenders, the Tampa Bay Lightning and Anaheim Ducks seem to be following parallel paths this season.

OK, so maybe I have a bit personally invested in the dramatic turnarounds of Tampa Bay and Anaheim, having picked them in September as my Cup finalists, only to feel a bit dumb over the opening three months of the season.

Now? Well, I'm feeling pretty darn good about it all.

To be sure all roads lead through the Washington Capitals in the East and the Chicago Blackhawks and Los Angeles Kings in the West, but I would argue the Bolts and Ducks have made this a tidy group of five as far as those with realistic Stanley Cup chances for the 2015-16 season.

Editor's Picks Boudreau's role in the Ducks' turnaround The Ducks are back in the midst of top Cup contenders. Craig Custance explores how Bruce Boudreau got them there, plus nine other weekend takeaways.

Splitting Corey Perry and Ryan Getzlaf is a hit It's been a surprise to many, but putting Corey Perry and Ryan Getzlaf on separate lines gives the Ducks more scoring depth.

Power Rankings: Race to the top heating up While the top team in the rankings remains the same, three hard-charging challengers are in the midst of impressive hot streaks that have shaken things up down below. 2 Related

Both teams have overtaken their respective divisions -- a feat that seemed very unlikely less than two months ago.

The Ducks have won a franchise-record 11 in a row; the Lightning a franchise-record nine consecutive games.

Again, it's the symmetry of these two teams that's hard to ignore. In early December when I spoke to each team's captain, both teams were flailing away and looking for answers. Both clubs would endure more pain in December.

Then the dramatic turnaround: The Ducks are an NHL-best 25-4-2 since the Christmas break; the Lightning 21-6-0 since Jan. 1.

""It was frustrating for everybody in the beginning of the season, but as a group, I think we never ended up pointing fingers,"" Ducks top blueliner Cam Fowler said over the phone Sunday. ""We kind of understood that for the most part nobody was playing up to their standards and we still had tons of belief in each other and as a team that we just needed to get back to playing confidently and do the things that made us successful last season. Once we put our belief in that and started seeing some results, we were able to gain some momentum from that.""

Momentum? The Ducks were still 16 points back of the Pacific Division-leading Kings on Jan. 20. Now they're up by two points after a hard-fought win against their cross-town rivals on Saturday.

The Bolts were 12 points behind the first-place Florida Panthers on Jan. 7. Now they're two points up.

The turnaround for them?

""I think it just came down to realizing where we were at and realizing that if we don't improve we're not going to make the playoffs,"" key Lighting blueliner Anton Stralman said Sunday over the phone. ""It was as simple as that I think. When we finally did, everyone kind of sharpened up and made sure we were on the same page and followed the system and did what we were supposed to do. We obviously know the talent that was in our group and how we can play. It was just a matter of finding that again.""

I'm no expert on the nerdy numbers, but here's what I can gather via war-on-ice.com: Since Jan. 1, the Ducks are scoring 55.4 percent of the even strength goals against opponents. The Lightning are even better at 56.4 percent. Tampa is now No. 3 in the league in this stat, while Anaheim is still just No. 20 overall, which shows how low they were before they turned it around. If they ran at 55.4 percent over the course of the season, they'd be at No. 3 overall in the league.

Looking at corsi (shot attempts) for percentage, these two teams are both top six overall, with Anaheim in the No. 3 spot at 52.9 percent and Tampa Bay No. 6 at 52.3 percent.

Bottom line: These are two of the elite teams in the NHL right now by any definition.

In both cases, however, the journey featured team meetings and white-knuckle moments.

""We had a few meetings along the way,"" Stralman said. ""Was there one along the way that set everything straight? I don't think so. But we had meetings throughout the year. We just realized where we are at and how we needed to change our mindset.""

In the case of the Ducks, Fowler credited Anaheim general manager Bob Murray for showing patience when they fell on their face ... for three months no less. Head coach Bruce Boudreau was surely going to be fired, right? But he was not. Now he might end up in the Jack Adams Award vote.

""You have to credit Murph [Murray] a lot for that, for being as patient as he was, because in this business, especially for how our offseason went and the projections and predications that people had for us, it would have been easy to say, 'OK, this isn't good enough, we need to make a change right now, something needs to happen,'"" Fowler said. ""But he hung in there. I think now, with us being in a much better position and playing better, we can look at some of those times we went through earlier and use them as positives for our group; that we went [through] some adversity.

""Being around the group now, it's as close-knit and as tight of a group as I've been around in quite some time. So I think as tough as it was in the beginning, I think now that we've dug ourselves out of it and we did it together with pretty much the same core group that was here at the start of the year, it's done a lot of things for us psychologically and I think we can use it as momentum for us going forward the rest of the season.""

Like Fowler, Stralman also believes that the trying times of the first half can only serve to strengthen the resolve of his team.

""I absolutely agree with that,"" Stralman said. ""You learn a lot through those periods when you're struggling, as individuals and as a team. You do clear the air a little bit sometimes. You re-focus. That's a learning process. We're still growing as a team. We're still a young team and inexperienced in many ways, still a lot of young guys. Last year's playoff run was a good learning experience, and definitely early this season, the journey so far has been a good experience, too. All these things add up and make us a better team I think.""

I specifically asked both teams to speak with Fowler and Stralman, because I feel each of these defensemen were rocks throughout the ups and down of this season. Neither looks for attention but it's important to note just that in each case.

What's also interesting is how each responded when asked about the amazing runs each team is on now.

""The way I look at it right now, even though we've played some good hockey, I still feel we can play a lot better,"" Stralman said. ""That's really encouraging to know we still have another gear to put in, it's just a matter of finding it.""

Added Fowler: ""We like where we're at right now, but there's still plenty of room for improvement, too.""

It's the only attitude to have. You don't want to peak too early, after all. The real hockey starts in a month. But both of these teams had to start the playoffs before the playoffs just to save their seasons.

They've done that. Now they've joined the big boys once again as legitimate Cup contenders.",[]

Lydia Ko has accomplished a lot in her short 18 years on the planet. From taking over the world's top ranking to becoming the youngest player ever on the LPGA tour to win 10 titles, Ko already has quite the enviable resume and life.

And on Wednesday, the New Zealand teen's life somehow got even cooler. In San Francisco to promote next month's Swinging Skirts LPGA Classic, Ko took advantage of her location and headed over to Oakland for the Warriors shootaround.

espn.com,,Guide to League of Legends,"['James Obscurica', 'Wynton Prog', 'Obscurica Chen', 'Stephen Chiu', 'Dan Szymborski', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Erzberger James', 'Chase Geddes', 'Timothy Lee', 'Tomi Lurppis']","Despite suffering their first loss of the entire tournament in Game 3, SK Telecom T1 prevailed over fellow Koreans KOO Tigers to claim the LoL World Championship and $1 million in front of a sold-out crowd at Mercedes Benz Arena in Berlin. (4:31)

In 2014, for the first time, a streamed game's broadcast attracted more viewers than the NBA Finals. More than 27 million people around the world tuned in to League of Legends World Championship. A year later, more than 31 million people watched SK Telecom T1 beat KOO Tigers 3-1 for the 2015 title and a split of a $1 million prize.

All this is arguably the culmination of a recent trend that has seen esports vault into the forefront of many consumers' minds. To meet and expand the ever increasing interest in esports, League of Legends' creator, Riot Games, opted to expand its marketing horizons and dabble in the fantasy scene, which brings us to the here and now.

To many, the game itself is still an enigma, and its rules are as cryptic to someone on the outside as the NFL's penalty system is to me (I have yet to hear an adequate explanation of what on earth is ""clipping""). Seeing as I would never gamble upon a football team without full knowledge of the rules, I imagine that many potential new fantasy owners might be intimidated by professional League of Legends, and esports as a whole, due to that complexity. Thankfully, like many things in life, the game becomes quite simple after a brief explanation.

What is League of Legends?

The top League of Legends players from around the world gather in Los Angeles for an LCS All-Stars event last month. Earlier, the League of Legends World Championships 2015 final match was viewed by over 36 million people online worldwide. Riot

League of Legends (LoL for short) is in a genre known as the Multiplayer Online Battle Arena, or MOBA for short. The history of the MOBA stretches all the way back to the modding community of Starcraft, and fortunately its underlying design is both simple to understand and has remained relatively static throughout the years. The game is ultimately one of objective defense -- a glorified capture the flag, if you will. Each player takes control of a unique and powerful unit, known in League as a champion, and, along with four allies, does battle with an enemy team comprised of the same. Each team is looking to destroy the central building for the opposition, appropriately known as a Nexus.

They are, however, not alone in this struggle. Each Nexus spawns weak, computer-controlled units, known as minions, that will mindlessly march down one of the main three lanes into which the game is divided. Eventually, the minions will encounter their counterparts on the opposite team, and they will immediately engage in a fight to the death.

Additionally, each lane is defended by a series of powerful turrets, and the minions are integral to destroy these emplacements. Small groups can serve as cannon fodder for allied champions, while larger groups can reduce enemy structures to rubble single-handedly, granting their team the valuable gold that doing so rewards.

Fenrir: Team change in wake of The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Lu ""Fenrir"" Chao

Team: Ehome

Update: Ehome will drop both Cty and kaka in a startling roster shakeup, while Fenir will join Ehome according to LiquidDota.

Analysis: Another bombshell dropped as roster shakeups across the Dota 2 landscape come into focus. Fenrir is a very capable support player who will now have to find his way on a different team. Ehome will participate in the upcoming ESL One Manila 2016 LAN Finals, being played April 22-24 in Manila, the Philippines.

IceIceIce: More Shanghai fallout as IceIceIce moves to new team

Name: Koh ""IceIceIce"" Pei Xiang

Team: Ehome

Update: In what appears to be even more fallout from The Shanghai Major FInals, IceIceIce will join Ehome's DOTA2 roster according to LiquidDota.

Analysis: Shocking news as Ehome will release both Cty and kaka from the team. Ehome was one of the odds on favorites to win The Shanghai Major, but couldn't get past Alliance in the second round of the bottom bracket tying with four other teams for 9th place. IceIceIce is a high-risk, high reward type of player that likes to push offlane. Ehome and IceIceIce will play in the ESL One Manila 2016 LAN Finals on April 22-24 in Manila, Philippines.

Cty: Joins Ehome exodus following disappointing performance at The Shanghai Major

Name: Tian ""Cty"" Yu Chen

Team: N/A

Update: Cty was let go by Ehome following a disappointing run during The Shanghai Major, LiquidDota reports.

Analysis: In an alarming move, Ehome opted to making sweeping changes after The Shanghai Major, a tournament in which the odds on favorites were unable to make it into the top eight. While inevitably, someone on Ehome had to take the fall for their dismal performance, it's unclear why the Chinese team opted to rid themselves of Cty, who contributed nearly 50 kills during the tournament and is widely considered one of the premiere carries within the sport. Cty should have no shortage of suitors when he eventually decides to rejoin the scene.

Kaka: Released by Ehome

Name: Hu ""Kaka"" Liangzhi

Team: N/A

Update: Kaka was released by Ehome, according to LiquidDota .

Analysis: While Cty's release, one of a handful of surprising moves made by Ehome following their unsuccessful run during The Shanghai Major, was a bit perplexing, Kaka's release seems a bit more understandable considering his ugly performance during Ehome's elimination match against Alliance, in which he posted a 1/7/8 KDA on Bane. After spending the last six months with Ehome, helping the club take home first place finishes at the Dota 2 Radiant and Dire Cup 2015, the Shanghai Dota 2 Open as well as the MarsTV Dota 2 League Winter 2015, the former HyperGlory support will try to catch on with another club in the coming weeks.

Ghostik: Signs on with Team Empire

Name: Andrey ""Ghostik"" Kadyk

Team: Team Empire

Update: Ghostik will join the Team Empire roster and compete at the upcoming Dota Pit 4 Finals.

Analysis: The Russian team was forced to make quick roster decisions after they parted ways with XBOCT last week. fn is expected to take over the carry role for Team Empire, but the team did suggest that this lineup could be temporary - making their success at the upcoming Dota Pit 4 Finals paramount if the relatively unknown player plans to stick with Empire for the long-haul.

fn: Joins Team Empire

Name: Rostislav ""fn"" Lozovoi

Team: Team Empire

Update: fn will join Team Empire for the upcoming Dota Pit 4 Finals.

Analysis: The Russian team was forced to make quick roster decisions after they parted ways with XBOCT last week. fn is expected to take over the carry role for Team Empire, but the team did suggest that this lineup could be temporary - making their success at the upcoming Dota Pit 4 Finals paramount if the relatively unknown player plans to stick with Empire for the long-haul.

Funn1k: Will remain with Team Empire

Name: Gleb ""Funn1k"" Lipatnikov

Team: Team Empire

Update: Funn1k will remain with Team Empire, despite the fact that he will be unable to attend the upcoming Dota Pit 4 Finals.

Analysis: Rumors had been circulating for weeks that Team Empire was looking to make a roster shakeup -- ones that only seemed to intensify after XBOCT was released. As of now, it appears as if the Korean offlaner will remain with the club, although the alarmingly small amount of information surronding his presence, or lack thereof, at the upcoming LAN event isn't necessarily a vote of confidence by the team.

XBOCT: Released by Team Empire

Name: Alexander ""XBOCT"" Dashkevich

Team: N/A

Update: XBOCT has been released by Team Empire, with the team citing ""unstable recent performances"" as the reason for dismissal.

Analysis: XBOCT's tenure with Team Empire came to a close last week after a series of up-and-down performances in the past three months. While Empire was able to qualify for the ESL One Manila, they struggled during the European qualifications for the Shanghai Major, winning just three of their eight playoff games. With the Dota Pit 4 Finals looming, Team Empire was forced to put together a makeshift roster, with former Power Rangers carry, fn, taking over for XBOCT. It appears likely the XBOCT may find his way onto another team, but his time in the Dota 2 spotlight appears to be fading fast.

MARCH 6, 2016

w33: Leads all players in kills as Team Secret wins The Shanghai Major

Name: Aliwi ""w33"" Omar

Team: Team Secret

Update: w33 used four different heroes in Team Secret's 3-1 win over Liquid in The Shanghai Major Finals capturing the $1,100,000 prize.

Analysis: w33 was the decisive force, leading all players in kills with a KDA of 40/10/38. In Game One w33, as Slark in the mid lane, used Pounce expertly to leash enemy players, holding them in place for team ganks. In Game Two, w33 used Death Prophet, again holding down mid, finishing with a KDA 13/6/7. However it was Game Three that will stand out in the minds of fans everywhere. In one of the most epic stands in the tournament, w33 as Invoker, stood his ground and slaughtered four players in the span of 40 seconds. Unleashing Cold snap with Tornado, the level 25 Invoker was simply too much and Liquid could do nothing but surrender.

Game Four wasn't much of a game, with Liquid still feeling the effects of w33's damage during the last team fight. w33 and Team Secret would go on to win The Shanghai Major Finals, 26-3 in a 25-minute rout.

Puppey: Fantastic in tournament finals at The Shanghai Major

Name: Clement ""Puppey"" Ivanov

Team: Team Secret

Update: Puppey finished the tournament on a high note, sporting a 20/13/50 KDA in Team Secret's 3-1 over Liquid in The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: Puppey was nearly omnipresent in his vision and play calling ability throughout this match. In Game One Puppey would be the shot caller playing Enchantress to a KDA of 8/1/12. He used her abilities to slow her opponents using Untouchable, one of the longest slows of any heroes. Puppey roamed lane to lane dealing damage to anybody in his path. Game Two would see Puppey choose Winter Wyvern, trying to Soar and get to team ganks quickly. It wasn't to be as Liquid countered well and Puppey could only get to a 2/6/10 KDA.

However, in what turned out to be the decisive and soul crushing Game Three for Liquid, Puppey turned to Doom and tied teammate MiSeRy for the game lead in assists with 19. Doom is particularly fearsome while gaining abilities not needing to level up but instead simply draining creeps and enemies. Game Four seemed to have already been decided, as Puppey, using Doom once again, thumped Liquid with a KDA of 20/13/50. The fourth game lasted a mere 25-minutes as Team Secret took home the $1,100,000 prize as The Shanghai Major Champions.

EternaLEnVy: Outstanding performance results in Shanghai Major win

Name: Jacky ""EternaLEnVy"" Mao

Team: Team Secret

Update: EternaLEnVy was outstanding in Team Secret's Shanghai Major tournament win with a 37/11/34 KDA.

Analysis: EternaLEnVy rose to level 25 in just about record time in Team Secret's Game One win, using Slark to decimate enemies. He dealt 31,500 in hero damage directly resulting in 11 kills. Game Two was an aberration for Secret, taking a surprising 25-30 loss. In Game Two, EternaLEnVy drafted Ursa in an attempt to support w33 playing Death Prophet. However, the Liquid tandem of Invoker and Beastmaster proved too much. Game Three would go down as epic, with Team Secret winning 35-19.

In that game, EternaLEnVy would choose Clinkz, using his ranged and stealth attacks to get the jump on Liquid in the bottom lane. EternaLEnVy was superior in the middle portion of Game Three killing off eight members of Liquid in a 10-minute period. EternaLEnVy would lead all players with nine kills in Team Secret's Game Four win taking The Shanghai Major crown and the $1,100,000 prize.

MiSeRy: Lends helping hand in Team Secret's 3-1 win in The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Rasmus ""MiSeRy"" Filipsen

Team: Team Secret

Update: MiSeRy played the support role well, performing to a 21/15/56 KDA in Team Secert's 3-1 championship win at The Shanghai Major.

Analysis: MiSeRy stayed home in the bottom lane using Tidehunter in Game One, assisting in 18 kills with a KDA of 6/4/18. MiSeRy did lead his team in Game Two in assists with 12, but Team Secret would lose this game 31-25 in just over 50 minutes. Game Three was for all intents and purposes the decisive game of the match.

MiSeRy drafted Nature's Prophet again holding down the bottom lane from any Liquid rushes. MiSeRy was irreplaceable in the most important team fight of the tournament assisting Invoker, played by w33, in four kills which secured a Game Three win. In Game Four, Team Liquid looked and played mentally exhausted giving Team Secret and MiSeRy all they needed as MiSeRy slashed out to a 7/1/7 KDA and a Team Secret championship at The Shanghai Major.

MATUMBAMAN: Positive KDA not enough in series loss to Team Secret

Name: Lasse ""MATUMBAMAN"" Urpalainen

Team: Team Liquid

Update: MATUMBAMAN was the lone bright spot in an otherwise ugly performance by Team Liquid during The Shanghai Major Finals. Through four games, MATUMBAMAN put together a 27/19/22 KDA.

Analysis: Team Liquid attempted to prioritize building FATA throughout the series, but it was actually MATUMBAMAN who was the star of the series, particularly in Game Two. While FATA was able to deal large amounts of damage to Team Secret, it was MATUMBAMAN who came in to clean things up, using Lycan to rack up 14 total kills and deal the most hero damage (20,217) in the game.

While his performance fell off in Games Three and Four, MATUMBAMAN was the only player on Team Liquid who could consistently deal damage to his opponents, and he was able to do it with a litany of heroes, making him arguably more valuable than FATA in future tournaments.

KuroKy: Ugly KDA numbers culminate in Shanghai Finals loss

Name: Kuro ""KuroKy"" Salehi Takhasomi

Team: Team Liquid

Update: KuroKy struggled mightily during Team Liquid's series loss to Team Secret at The Shanghai Major Finals, submitting a 4/37/23 series KDA.

Analysis: A support's KDA will never tend to be the best figure during a series loss, but KuroKy had a hard time staying alive during the series. While he was able to put together some impressive healing performances, particularly in Game Two, where he recorded a team-high 4,358 figure, he continually found himself in poor positions becoming food for a hungry Team Secret.

While Team Liquid should take solace in the fact that they did make it to the final match-up at The Shanghai Major, it certainly wasn't thanks to KuroKy, who stumbled through much of the group stage portion of the event as well.

FATA: Unable to carry team to Shanghai series victory

Name: Adrian ""FATA"" Trinks

Team: Team Liquid

Update: FATA posted a 23/22/26 series KDA during Team Liquid's Shanghai Major Finals loss to Team Secret.

Analysis: FATA lived, but mostly died with his hero of choice, Invoker. In Game One, FATA opted to use Invoker, but never really became the serious threat Team Liquid was hoping for, putting forth the second lowest hero damage total on the team. The solo mid doubled down on the decision in Game Two, opting to use Invoker once again. This time, though, FATA excelled, racking up kills and assists while pulverizing Team Secret's mistakes to the tune of a 10/4/14 KDA.

Game Three found FATA on a different hero, the Outworld Devourer, and while he was able to put up hefty KDA numbers, his team was unable to prioritize a second heavy, resulting in the mid accounting for nearly half of the teams kills. And in what quickly became a joke of a Game Four, MATA and the rest of Team Liquid succumbed to an unrelenting w33, as Team Secret won the game in just over 25 minutes, relegating Team Liquid to a second place finish at The Shanghai Major tournament.

Peterpandam: Effective in two-game series win over MVP Phoenix

Name: Peter ""(ppd) Peterpandam"" Dager

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: ppd went 3/5/27 against MVP Phoenix during Evil Geniuses 2-0 win in the lower bracket of the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: ppd, on Crystal Maiden, had a KDA of 0/3/15 against MVP Phoenix in Game 1 of a best-of-three series. ppd roamed the jungle with his pick, assisting on 15 of his team's 28 kills. ppd didn't need much gold to be effective, finishing with the lowest amount of gold earned on his team with 10,200. In Game 2, ppd helped close the door on MVP Phoenix when he went back to Crystal Maiden. ppd had a 3/2/12 KDA in the series-clinching win.

SumaiL: Almost unkillable against MVP Phoenix

Name: Syed ""SumaiL "" Sumail

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: SumaiL had a 19/2/14 KDA during Evil Geniuses' 2-0 series win against MVP Phoenix in the lower bracket of the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: SumaiL opted to pick Death Prophet during Evil Geniuses' Game 1 win over MVP Phoenix. The result? The mid laner posted an 11/1/6 KDA as Evil Geniuses snatched a 32-minute win. SumaiL tied for the most damage dealt, bashing MVP Phoenix for 14,700 damage. The trend continued into Game 2, as SumaiL helped EG seal the series, posting an 8/1/8 KDA while dealing a huge amount of damage (14,000). SumaiL showed his mid lane Templar Assassin is a force to be reckoned with.

MP: Unable to carry MVP Phoenix

Name: Pyo ""MP"" No-a

Team: MVP Phoenix

Update: MP finished with a KDA of 7/11/12 as MVP Phoenix fell 2-0 to Evil Geniuses in the lower bracket of the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: MP served as the lone bright spot for MVP Phoenix during its Game 1 loss against Evil Geniuses. MP finished with a 4/4/6 KDA while playing a safe lane Spectre. He posted his team's highest gold total (15,400) but couldn't do enough to help MVP Phoenix deal with EG. In Game 2, MP fell off a bit, dropping his KDA down to 3/7/6. MP had Invoker in the mid lane but couldn't find his footing, dealing a low amount of damage (6,300).

Fear: Picks Earth Spirit twice to fend off MVP Phoenix

Name: Clinton ""Fear"" Loomis

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: Fear posted a KDA of 4/6/34 as Evil Geniuses defeated MVP Phoenix 2-0 in the lower bracket of the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Fear took Earth Spirit into the mid lane and kept his team healthy during Evil Geniuses' Game 1 win over MVP Phoenix. Fear finished with a 3/2/17 KDA and healed allies for 1,600. Fear got Earth Spirit again in Game2o and shifted his play style a bit. Fear dealt slightly more damage (8,800) in the second match and healed his allies less (655). The result was a 1/4/17 KDA and a 35-minute victory for Evil Geniuses.

Arteezy: Dominates with Ursa in 2-0 series win

Name: Artour ""Arteezy"" Babaev

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: Arteezy earned a KDA of 22/4/8 during Evil Geniuses' 2-0 win over MVP Phoenix in the lower bracket of the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Arteezy selected Ursa and had a KDA of 12/2/4 against MVP Phoenix in Game 1. Arteezy stacked up his gold, racking up the most in the game with 19,800, and also tied for the most damage in the game at 14,700. He showed off Ursa's innate sustained damage ability, and Evil Genius reaped the benefits during its 32-minute win. Like many of his teammates in Game 2, Arteezy got his Game 1 pick, Ursa, back and excelled, putting together a KDA of 10/2/4 while racking up 21,600 gold.

MARCH 4, 2016

DkPhobos: Takes care of Vici Gaming in win

Name: Alexander ""DkPhobos"" Kucheria

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update: DK led his team to victory over Vici Gaming on Wednesday, posting a KDA of 8/2/11.

Analysis: DK, playing the offlane Beastmaster, had a very impressive match for an offlaner. DK led all players with eight kills while also assisting in another 11 kills .DK also took over as the leading pusher as he dealt over 2000 damage to enemy towers.

God: Asserts dominance over Vici Gaming

Name: Sergey ""God"" Bragin

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update: God smites Vici Gaming during their Wednesday series win, posting an impressive KDA of 7/1/22.

Analysis: God playing the mid lane Zeus, was an ever present nuisance for VG as his global prowess led to problems in engagements. God was tied for second in total kills with seven, while leading all players in the game with 22 assists. God was apart of 29 of 32 total kills of VP in the game, leading to an impressive hero damage total of over 17,000.

fng: Helps team more than triple opponents' kill total in win

Name: Artsiom ""fng"" Barshack

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update: fng played a flawless game against Vici Gaming on Wednesday, ending with a KDA of 7/0/16.

Analysis: Playing the jungling Enchantress, fng played a great, calculated game, ending the game with zero deaths in a kill-heavy match. fng was tied for second in total kills with seven, while also assisting in another 16. FNG also provided a nice pushing boost for VP, dealing over 2000 damage to enemy towers.

Handsken: Aids in Wednesday win

Name: Simon ""Handsken"" Haag

Team: compLexity Gaming

Update: Handsken played a fantastic support game in Complexity's series win over Spirit, putting up a KDA of 4/1/19.

Analysis: Handsken, playing the support Lich, played a nearly ideal game for any support player, tallying 19 assists while only dying once. Handsken spent much of his time middle with Tiny to secure his midlaners farm. Being the good support that he is, Handsken purchased a Urn of Shadows to heal his allies after fights.

Limmp: Carries team to win Wednesday

Name: Linus ""Limmp"" Blomdin

Team: compLexity Gaming

Update: Limmp carried his team to a match victory with a KDA of 12/1/15 during Wednesday's win over Team Spirit.

Analysis: Limmp put on a show in his match against Team Spirit. Playing the Tiny mid, he racked up the most kills in the match (12), while also assisting in another 15 kills. Limmp was far and away the biggest damage dealer in the game, tallying over 16,000. Limmp carried the momentum from a strong laning phase, using his gold to purchase a Blink Dagger to gank around the map utilizing his strong burst damage. Throughout Limp's active match, he still only died a single time.

Miracle: Best of worst in OG's 1-2 loss to Team Secret

Name: Amer ""Miracle"" Barqawi

Team: OG

Update: Miracle was a pleasant surprise in a crushing loss, posting a 12/6/9 KDA in a first round upper bracket match at The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: Miracle played steady amongst an onslaught that saw his teammates stumble throughout the match. OG won the first game despite having fewer kills than Team Secret, but the big story was Miracle. Miracle rushed opponent towers, playing Lone Druid, destroying six towers and four barracks for a total of 18,438 in damage. The rest of OG ran interference for Miracle allowing him to decimate opponent structures in the win. In Game Two, using Slark, Miracle lead the team in kills (5), gold (21,400) and tower damage (1,400).

It was a decent game for Miracle, but Team Secret was too much and they dropped the game. If an MVP could be given to the player on the losing side, Miracle would have earned it. With the first ever Terrorblade sighting in The Shanghai Major Finals, Miracle sliced and diced his way to a 5/0/1 KDA racking up even more hero and tower damage with 4,300 and 3,000 respectfully. Miracle constantly finds ways to keep his KDA numbers up and seems to be a solid player in every venue.

Fly-Simba-: Swatted in OG's 1-2 loss to Team Secret

Name: Tai ""Fly-Simba-"" Aizik

Team: OG

Update: Fly-Simba had perhaps his worst match of the year churning out a 3/16/13 KDA in their 1-2 loss to Team Secret in upper bracket play at The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: Fly-Simba went with Pugna, who had only been chosen once before in this tournament. Seems there was a reason players shied away from Pugna as Fly-Simba was shut out in the kills department with a 0/3/6 KDA. However, Pugna did a decent job of stopping any mid lane pushes using Nether Ward and Decrepify in an attempt to allow his team to attack slowed heroes. OG won the first game, having less kills, 13 to 17. In another interesting pick in Game Two, Fly-Simba selected Winter Wyvern who in the finals round was 0-2.

Fly-Simba would attempt to rotate and gank but ended up on the negative side of the KDA spectrum going 2/9/2 for the game. In reality it was more of the same for Fly-Simba, going 1/4/5 playing the Lion in the bottom safe. Lion was commendable in stopping two bottom lane pushes, but couldn't rotate fast enough to mid or top lane and was often late to the fray. This lateness cost him as OG fell in Game Three and the match.

EternaLEnVy: After slow start, cleans up in 2-1 win over OG

Name: Jacky ""EternaLEnVy"" Mao

Team: Team Secret

Update: EternaLEnVy surged towards the end of the match finishing with a 13/5/15 KDA in their 2-1 win over OG at The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: Roaming with Weaver, EternaLEnVy was not effective in Game One staggering to a 2/3/8 KDA. But things turned around starting in Game Two with EternaLEnVy choosing the Drow Ranger. As the Ranger, EternaLEnVy buffed speed, agility and damage using ranged attacks on his way to a 6/1/4 KDA and a team win. In what is seemingly turning into a habit after a win, EternaLEnVy picked Drow Ranger and played another good game, racking up a KDA of 5/1/3. EternaLEnVy posted a triple-kill in support of Outworld Devourer in the Ancient rush procuring a Team Secret win.

w33: Lethal in Team Secret's 2-1 win over OG at The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Aliwi ""w33"" Omar

Team: Team Secret

Update: w33 continued to rank as one of the top players in the tournament with a 22/5/18 KDA in a first round victory at The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: w33 started off slow in the match, playing Ember Spirit to a 4/2/6 KDA in a very quick Team Secret loss. OG's Moonmeander kept the mid lane in check, pitting his Tidehunter against w33. In Game Two, w33 came back with revenge on his mind, selecting Outworld Devourer to do nothing but deal damage. With 12,900 in hero damage w33 lead all players in the category.

He rotated well between the mid and top lanes, culminating in a 1:13 teamfight, where he picked up two kills in the win. w33 went back to the well, acquiring Outworld Devourer for Game Three and the results were the same. w33 went for a 7/0/5 KDA, once again leading all players in kills, securing a match win for Team Secret.

MiSeRy: Leads all players in assists in Team Secret's 2-1 win over OG

Name: Rasmus ""MiSeRy"" Filipsen

Team: Team Secret

Update: MiSeRy ran amok pulling a 8/12/32 KDA in Team Secret's 2-1 win over OG in the first round of upper bracket play at The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: MiSeRy had a hand in over half of the total kills inflicted upon OG with 32 in this three game thriller. In Team Secret's Game One loss, MiSeRy played Nature's Prophet stuffing numerous top lane rushes, ending Game One win with a KDA of 2/4/8. Also of note in Game One, MiSeRy took out three towers, causing the most damage to towers and structures with 5,313. Sticking with Nature's Prophet in Game Two, MiSeRy lead all players in the game with 20 assists doing 10,200 in hero damage and 4,900 in tower damage.

MiSeRy was great in the late stages of the game coupling Aghanim's Scepter with his Wrath of Nature ability. This would prove devastating in the team fight during the rush at the Ancient. MiSeRy gave ample support to Outworld Devourer, played by w33, to the tune of one kill and eight assists in the final battle of Game Two. MiSeRy was anti-climactic in Game Three playing Beastmaster crawling to a 1/5/4 KDA in a Game Three Team Secret win.

Puppey: Advances to second round with 2-1 over Team OG

Name: Clement ""Puppey"" Ivanov

Team: Team Secret

Update: While Looper's 3/2/10 KDA may not raise any eyebrows, his impact on RNG's win over Ever cannot be overstated.

Analysis: Puppey played a strategically sound match, making good use of a rotating early rush, netting a kill and two assists by the four-minute mark in Game One as Earthshaker. After a loss in Game One, Team Secret went with an all-ranged line up with Puppey choosing to play Enigma. The plan worked, as Enigma played a huge part in taking out OG towers early en route to a 29-11 Game Two win.

Game Three would see a lot of slow play with the action not really starting until 19 minutes in. Puppey had a disappointing last game, getting zero kills but leading his team in assists with six in their 16-9 game and match win. Not a great match for Puppey, but enough to help get this win. Team Secret will take on Evil Geniuses in Round Two.

Name: Meng ""Xiao2le"" Lei

Team: NewBee

Update: Xiao2le played a well-rounded match going 9/4/14 KDA in their 1-0 win over CDEC at The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: Xiao2le played Doom using Devour, consuming creeps by the dozens gaining their abilities and bonus gold. Maxing out Scorched Earth by level seven allowed Xiao2le to damage enemies, create lanes for his team to escape and gave him a speed bonus with which he could attack or escape. Coming on a little late, but perhaps just in time, Xiao2le racked up five kills in the middle portion of this match, harassing CDEC at the same time. This allowed Phantom lancer to farm, gaining abilities. Xiao2le was third of all players in assists with three and fifth in gold earned with 28,700.

Mu: Pole to pole in NewBee's 1-0 win over CDEC

Name: Zhang ""Mu"" Pan

Team: NewBee

Update: Mu, playing Batrider, flew his way to a 1/5/22 KDA in their BO1 win over CDEC in a bottom bracket match win at The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: Mu was unrivaled as Batrider in his ability to quickly get to various spots on the map, assisting in kills. Batrider appeared to have stalked both Enchantress (Q) and Weaver (Agressif) racking up six kill assists on each. On an amazing note, Mu's buffing of Batrider's speed and agility allowed him to get in on kills on completely opposite sides of the map.

In a span of just over one minute Batrider got on assist at the top of CDEC's base and then sped down to bottom lane and picked up two more assists! Batrider's ability to rotate was the reason Mu lead all players with 22 assists. Mu is 46/37/68 KDA in his last nine games.

Hao: Lances through CDEC in 1-0 victory

Name: Chen ""Hao"" Zhihao

Team: NewBee

Update: Hao was impressive, amassing a 16/4/12 KDA in NewBee's 1-0 win over CDEC in a bottom bracket match of The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: Of Hao's 16 kills playing Phantom Lancer, 13 of them were by auto attack. A very impressive feat. Hao drew first blood, killing Beastmaster (Xz) at the 2:29 mark of the match, setting the tone. But what clearly set Hao apart from the rest of the players in this match was his farming, which netted him 46,879 gold, 15,000 more than the next player. His ability to buy items went unmatched and Hao had the advantage the entire match. Hao ended the match with a triple kill that ended any defense CDEC could mount.

Name: Artour ""Arteezy"" Babaev

Team: Evil Geniuses

Analysis: Arteezy dominated Game One against FNATIC. In a safe lane, Arteezy opted for Seven and posted a 5/0/7 KDA. He dealt the second most damage on his team at 7,700. Arteezy earned an impressive 30,300 gold, bolstering his ability to dismantle FNATIC and help Evil Geniuses nab a 1-0 lead. Arteezy couldn't follow up his Game One performance with another flawless KDA, but he still managed a strong showing, finishing with 13/4/8 KDA.

Arteezy selected Clinkz in Game Two, and it was the right choice. Arteezy once again amassed a preposterous amount of gold (22,000, nearly 5,000 more than anybody else) and led his team in damage with 14,000. Evil Geniuses made short work of FNATIC with a 2-0 series win.

Name: Clinton ""Fear"" Loomis

Team: Evil Geniuses

Analysis: Fear rotated between the mid lane and the jungle with Bounty Hunter in Game One against FNATIC. The result was a 8/1/7 KDA and a strong 7,000 damage dealt. Fear had his Bounty Hunter banned by FNATIC in Game Two, but still demonstrated excellence on Mirana, recording a 10/1/8 KDA as Evil Geniuses took a clean 2-0 series win. Fear dealt 9,400 damage while healing teammates for 1,400.

UNiVeRse: Almost unkillable against FNATIC

Name: Saahil ""UNiVeRse"" Arora

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: UNiVeRse had a 14/1/29 KDA against FNATIC as Evil Geniuses earned a 2-0 series in Round 1 of the upper bracket in the Shanghai Major.

The unkillable UNiVeRse also healed teammates for 1,400. UNiVeRse's perfect streak ended in Game Two, as the mid laner died once en route to a 10/1/15 KDA. UNiVeRse racked up 17,500 god and bruised FNATIC for 9,700 damage.

SumaiL : Dominates in different roles for Evil Geniuses

Name: Syed ""SumaiL "" Sumail

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: Suma1L went 15/6/33 as Evil Geniuses grabbed a 2-0 series win against FNATIC in Round 1 of the upper bracket at The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: Suma1L dominated the mid lane with Nyx Assassin in Game One against FNATIC. Suma1L compiled a 7/2/11 KDA, leading Evil Geniuses in damage with 8,300. Suma1L then switched to a Batrider in Game Two after FNATIC banned Nyx Assassin. The result? Suma1L crushed it again. He finished Game Two with a 8/4/22 KDA, dealing an impressive 10,400 damage.

(ppd) Peterpandam: Guides Evil Geniuses to 2-0 win over FNATIC

Name: Peter ""(ppd) Peterpandam"" Dager

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: Peterpandam went 2/7/32 as Evil Geniuses defeated FNATIC 2-0 in Round 1 in upper bracket play at The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: The Evil Genius team captain, The Evil Genius team captain, Peterpandam, took Witch Doctor in Game One against FNATIC. His safe lane play led to a 1/4/11 KDA, and more importantly, a series-opening win for EG. Peterpandam dished out 1,600 worth of heals. Peterpandam served as his team's sacrificial lamb, dying to set up more plays for the rest of the team.

It's hard to argue with the end result, as Evil Geniuses went on to a 36-minute victory. Peterpandam kept producing in Game Two, using a 1/3/21 KDA as Vengeful Spirit to help Evil Geniuses close out the series 2-0. Peterpandam once again healed teammates, rejuvenating allies for 1,300 points.

MARCH 2, 2016

Xz: Gritty effort not enough as CDEC loses 0-1 at The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Chen ""Xz"" Zezhi

Team: CDEC Gaming

Update: Xz struggled to a 1/6/10 KDA in CDEC's 0-1 loss to NewBee in a bottom bracket match at the The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: Xz selected Beastmaster in an attempt to hold down the bottom lane. He was caught early however, by Phantom Lancer (Hao) and Rubick (ChuaN) in a quick rush taking place at 2:29 for first death. After being killed three times, Xz got his first kill at the 29:26 mark. Xz was essentially playing the role of scout sending out his Call of The Wild to view the battlefield.

He used his vision in an attempt to blind Newbee by destroying five Observation Wards and two Sentry Wards. This dual role of gaining vision and taking away vision didn't produce good KDA numbers that some people would like to see. CDEC will finish The Shanghai Major tied for 13th.

Agressif: Plays well in 0-1 loss to NewBee in The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Sun ""Agressif"" Zheng

Team: CDEC Gaming

Update: Agressif played his way to a 10/6/9 KDA as Weaver in CDEC's 0-1 bottom bracket loss to Newbee at The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: Agressif played Weaver mostly in the top lane farming furiously to advance levels. The farming paid off as Weaver did in fact hit level 25, farming 30,286 of the 31,500 total gold acquired. Along with the gold, Agressif added 413 Last Hits to go along with 13 denies. Seven of Weaver's 10 kills were committed before the 48 minute mark in this marathon of a game which lasted 1:02:17. Agressif was the last man standing before the onslaught to the Ancient by Newbee, but went down swinging taking Phoenix (le) with him. CDEC finishes The Shanghai Major tied for 13th.

Jeyo: Valiant in loss to Ehome

Name: Jio ""Jeyo"" Madayag

Team: Team Archon

Update: Jeyo went 2/4/5 KDA in Archon's 0-1 loss to Ehome in the first round of bottom bracket play in The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: Jeyo picked Slark in hopes of utilizing Essence Shift in order to drain enemy heroes abilities and transform them into agility. Unfortunately, Jeyo didn't have enough time to level up as the match lasted just under 28 minutes. On the positive, Jeyo did lead Archon in Last Hits and hero damage dealt with 6,000. Archon exits the tournament tied for 13th.

Kaka: Healing and dealing damage ensures Ehome victory

Name: Hu ""Kaka"" Liangzhi

Team: Ehome

Update: kaka epitomized the true all-around player with a KDA 5/2/15 while healing 3,700 in Ehome's 1-0 victory over Archon in bottom bracket play of The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: kaka, playing Phoenix in the bottom lane, pushed early into Archon's territory using Sun Ray to good effect. kaka played Phoenix to the meta starting out with two iron branches, Tango and Clarity. He used these items well early, farming and leveling quickly. In a great tactical stroke, during the pivotal 5-vs-5 battle that would eventually decide the game, kaka used Phoenix's Supernova that helped kill all five members of Archon at 26:47.

eLeVeN: Leads Ehome in assists in win over Archon

Name: Yang ""eLeVeN"" Wei Ren

Team: Ehome

Update: eLeVeN lead all players in the match in assists showing a 4/2/16 KDA in Ehome's 1-0 bottom bracket win over Archon in The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: eLeVeN picked Tidehunter as Ehome's first selection in an attempt to use its brute melee strength in holding down mid lane. Playing Tidehunter to meta perfection, starting with Tango and Clarity, eLeVeN could not be pushed out of mid. Maxing out Anchor Smash by level six, Tidehunter started to push mid lane with Outworld Devourer (oldchicken) to devastating effect. Only 10 of the 38 kills in this match took place on Ehome's side of the map. eLeVeN is 50/80/113 in his last 12 games.

oldchicken: Another solid match at The Shanghai Major

Name: Wang ""oldchicken"" Zhiyong

Team: Ehome

Update: oldchicken was on his game once again with a 7/3/11 KDA in Ehome's 1-0 victory over Archon in bottom bracket play at The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: Leveling to 16, oldchicken played Outworld Devourer in the bottom lane getting in on 62 percent of Ehome's kills. The defining moment in the match for oldchickeen occured at the 27:14 mark when an epic 5-vs-5 took place just outside the bottom steps on Archon's base. After an initial rush by Ursa (Cty), oldchicken went to work unleashing Arcane Orb, allowing him to kill the Enchantress, adding an assist on Beastmaster. The rush to the Ancient was on and Ehome went on to win 29-9.

Cty: Bearish in Ehome's 1-0 victory in bottom bracket play at The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Tian ""Cty"" Yu Chen

Team: Ehome

Update: Cty swiped and clawed his way to a 10/1/5 KDA in Ehome's 1-0 win over Archon in the first round of bottom bracket play at The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: Cty lead all players with 10 kills, farming at first and then rotating down to mid lane to engage Archon. As Ursa, Cty maxed out Fury Swipes by level seven and Overpower by 12. Roaming with Tusk (LaNm) at mid lane, Ursa caused damage to heroes and towers alike. With three multi-kills, three tower kills, and two Roshan kills, Cty wielded Ursa's claws to a solid Ehome victory. Cty is 45/20/54 in his seven games at The Shanghai Major.

MMY!: Holds own in LGD's 0-2 loss to MVP Phoenix at The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Lei ""MMY!"" Zengrong

Team: LGD Gaming

Update: MMY! played a hard fought match posting a 3/9/12 KDA in 0-2 loss to MVP Phoenix at The Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: Nothing really went right for LGD or MMY! in this match. MMY! chose Disruptor as his team's first pick to the surprise of fans and pundits. MMY! pulled one over on them posting a 2/3/1 KDA which accounted for 75 percent of LGD's kills in Game One. However, It wasn't enough as LGD lost Game One 4-18.

Game Two was a little better as MMY! chose Earth Spirit, opting to play him in the mid lane. Although the kills weren't there, he did manage 11 assists on his way to a 1/6/11 KDA in Game Two. MMY! is 24/44/87 in his last 10 games.

Maybe: Lone bright spot in LGD's 0-2 loss to MVP Phoenix

Name: Yao ""Maybe"" Lu

Team: LGD Gaming

Update: While not really lucky, Maybe was sevens across the board with a 7/7/7 KDA in LGD's 0-2 loss to MVP Phoenix in the opening round of The Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: Overall a miserable day for LGD, Maybe salvaged a decent KDA considering the overall direction of the match. In Game One, Maybe took Razor playing the mid lane. He assisted in three of the four total kills LGD managed against MVP Phoenix. Game One lasted a mere 23 minutes and 16 seconds in the loss for LGD.

Game Two was much better for Maybe, but not LGD, as Maybe mounted a KDA of 7/2/4. Using Ursa in the mid lane, Maybe attempted to hold back MVP Phoenix's mid lane pushes by getting two kills, but was overwhelmed, losing the match and the game. Maybe is 60/37/74 KDA at The Shanghai Major.

FoREV: Mobility the key in MVP Phoenix's 2-0 win over LGD

Name: Lee ""FoREV"" Sang-don

Team: MVP Phoenix

Update: FoREV was superb, pushing to a 12/2/21 KDA in MVP Phoenix's 2-0 win over LGD in the first round of The Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: FoREV, teleported his way to zero deaths, playing to a 5/0/8 KDA in Game One of the match. Playing Nature's Prophet in the top lane, FoREV was a tower killing machine dealing 6,100 in damage, taking out two towers, three barracks and a Roshan while gaining an Aegis (which he wouldn't need). As a result Game One went to MVP Phoenix.

In a hero not used very often, Bristleback was FoREV's choice for Game Two. Bristleback would net a KDA of 7/2/13 for FoREV, as MVP Phoenix would go on to win Game Two and the match. FoREV is 30/9/62 KDA combined in matches at The Shanghai Major.

MP: All-around play propels MVP Phoenix to 2-0 win over LGD

Name: Pyo ""MP"" No-a

Team: MVP Phoenix

Update: MP played firm, collecting a 10/3/12 KDA in MVP Phoenix's 2-0 win over LGD in the opening round of The Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: MP, playing the bottom lane Outworld Devourer in Game One, lead all players with six kills, zero deaths and four assists. He played a multi-faceted damaging role doing 8,300 hero damage and 3,300 tower damage in an 18-4 Game One drubbing of LGD. A change of hero and lane in Game Two would affect MP's overall KDA to the tune of 4/3/8.

Playing Juggernaut, MP lost the head-to-head battle with LGD's Ursula (Maybe), being killed three times, but won the game destroying three towers, one barrack and a Roshan. MP is 33/7/52 KDA in all matches in The Shanghai Major.

QO: Unshakable in first round win at The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Kim ""QO"" Seon-yeop

Team: MVP Phoenix

Update: QO continued to impress going 10/4/15 in MVP Phoenix's win over LGD in the first round of The Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: Not banning Ember Spirit was a mistake by LGD as QO was a hero-damaging machine, leading his team with 9,100 earning a 1/1/11 KDA. QO played mid lane so effectively that only five of the 22 total kills in this game took place on MVP Phoenix's side of the map. Game Two was a little more challenging, but QO, playing Invoker devastated LGD to the tune of a 9/3/14 KDA. As the top leveler, QO was able to max out Wex by level 12, using the speed and agility bonus to dash in and out attacking his opponents.

Of particular attack value to QO was his ability, Tornado, which he used expertly to suspend LGD heroes in the air as his teammates hit them with attacks. MVP Phoenix is 6-0 at The Shanghai Major with QO's KDA of 47/8/53 being a big reason.

AdmiralBulldog: Bite not big enough as Alliance drops finals opener to Team Liquid

Name: Henrik ""AdmiralBulldog"" Ahnberg

Team: Alliance

Update: AdmiralBulldog had more deaths than kills for the first time in The Shanghai Major, posting a 12/15/27 KDA in a losing effort against Team Liquid on Tuesday.

Analysis: AdmiralBulldog, playing in the top lane with Lone Druid in Game One, missed out on team fight opportunities participating in only 31 percent of Alliance's kills. His KDA of 2/6/2 ranked last in terms of total kills. Even with his Spirit Bear maxed out by level seven, it simply wasn't enough to offset Team Liquid's URSA (MATUMBAMAN) who killed AdmiralBulldog twice mid lane. Game Two was much more to AdmiralBulldog's liking, finishing with a KDA of 5/3/18 using Beastmaster. Beastmaster was a particular anathema to Necrophos (MATUMBAMAN) killing him twice with five assists in and around the bottom lane.

AdmiralBulldog was an all-around player in Game Two doing 8,900 hero damage and 4,800 in tower damage in securing a Game Two Alliance win. AdmiralBulldog would look to repeat his numbers from Game Two and hopefully a win as he chose Beastmaster again for Game Three. However, that contest didn't go Alliance's way as they lost 15-33, with AdmiralBulldog posting a 5/6/7 KDA.

s4: Leading team in kills not enough to stave off Team Liquid

Name: Gustav ""s4"" Magnusson

Team: Alliance

Update: s4 played to a KDA of 16/17/22, but it wasn't enough as Alliance drops the first match of The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: s4, the mid laner for Alliance, used the Queen of Pain in Game One, finishing with a KDA of 6/4/3. s4 was the top leveler at 18 and didn't get the support needed to mount an effective offense or defense. In fact, in this Game One loss, Alliance never breached the steps of Team Liquid's base. In Game Two, s4 would see another positive KDA with 7/6/13 using Batrider to assist in team fights and farm gaining 21,900 gold.

s4's ability to rotate quickly while using the Firefly ability was crucial in forcing a Game Three.s4, using Puck, struggled along with the rest of the team posting a 3/7/6 KDA in Game Three. Although those numbers look bad, s4 did the best he could farming, collecting 17,200 gold (most on team). He also dished out the second most hero damage for Alliance with 9,500. Alliance would drop Game Three and the match to Team Liquid. s4 has been a solid player during The Shanghai Major with an overall tournament KDA of 52/33/94.

EGM: Disappointing start at The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Jerry ""EGM"" Lundkvist

Team: Alliance

Update: EGM toiled to a lackluster KDA of 7/21/21 in Alliance's 1-2 loss to Team Liquid at The Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: EGM had an ugly start to the match playing Silencer. His nine deaths (1/9/5) were the most of any player in the game and he was out of action just under nine minutes. Dazzel would be the hero of choice for EGM in Game Two, but the results were the same. A KDA of 3/4/11 would put him last in kills and assists for his team during the game. Not surprisingly EGM would also rank last in total gold (16,311), last hits (106) and denies (2). During team fights, EGM just couldn't hit the Arcane Curse/Global Silence combo and was rendered ineffective.

Playing Spirit Breaker in Game Three, EGM was in the jungle for most of the game. However, when EGM roamed to the top lane, he got beat up by Team Liquid's Invoker (FATA) dying three times. In The Shanghai Major, EGM has a KDA of 21/40/79.

FATA: Invokes Team Liquid to 2-1 win over Alliance at The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Adrian ""FATA"" Trinks

Team: Team Liquid

Update: FATA played well posting a 20/9/33 KDA in their 2-1 opening round win over Alliance in The Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: FATA was a force while holding down the mid lane with Outworld Devourer in Game One. He stuffed the mid-lane so brutally that there was only one push and it was knocked back aggressively at the 32:46 mark. He finished Game One with a KDA of 7/2/9 participating in just over half of Team Liquid's kills. Choosing Invoker for Game Two, FATA just couldn't seem to get a rhythm as Alliance skirted the mid-lane and attacked from top and bottom. FATA couldn't keep up with the rotation, but did manage to be second in assists on the team with 10, going along with his two kills.

Surprisingly, Invoker was not being banned by Alliance and FATA chose him again and this time it paid off. Using a Quas-Exort build, Invoker teamed up with the Anti-Mage using their powers in unison to absolutely crush Alliance. Invoker finished Game Three with a KDA of 11/2/14 and a double kill at the end of the match securing a Team Liquid win and advancement to the second round of the winner's bracket.

MATUMBAMAN: Monstrous match earns Team Liquid first round win

Name: Lasse ""MATUMBAMAN"" Urpalainen

Team: Team Liquid

Update: MATUMBAMAN, proving again why he is one of the best players in the world, rocketed to a 26/9/31 KDA in Team Liquid's first round win at The Shanghai Major on Tuesday.

Analysis: MATUMBAMAN created chaos and uncertainty for Alliance in Game One using Ursa, going with a powerful melee build. MATUMBAMAN leveled Fury Swipes to three and Overpower to two as his first five ability upgrades. In a great story line, MATUMBAMAN seemed to make it a personal mission to annihilate Silence (EGM) killing him on six different occasions and assisting once. In fact, killing Silencer at the 37:41 was key in capturing Game One. Game Two would see MATUMBAMAN struggle out of the gate with Necrophos decaying to a 4/8/14 KDA and a Team Liquid loss.

However, in Game Three, MATUMBAMAN would choose the Anti-Mage casting to a 8/0/12 KDA. Farming early and often, MATUMBAMAN gained 34,130 gold and had an astonishing 540 last hits which rocketed his XPM to 725. Alliance made the mistake of allowing MATUMBAMAN to farm unrestricted and this helped Team Liquid win Game Three.

KuroKy: Early jitters settle as KuroKy helps Team Liquid to win

Name: Kuro ""KuroKy"" Salehi Takhasomi

Team: Team Liquid

Update: KuroKy started off slow but salvaged an even KDA going 13/13/28 in Team Liquid's 2-1 win over Alliance in the opening round of the Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: KuroKy couldn't find the handle playing Tusk in Game One, limping to a 1/4/12 KDA while roaming the jungle in a Team Liquid win. Game Two would prove futile with KuroKy as Shadow Shaman going 6/6/7 with his team losing Game Two. Then came the Night Stalker. KuroKy played his best game of the series, using Void to perfection, maxing out the power by level seven. At the 25:17 mark of Game Three, KuroKy was instrumental in stopping a last ditch effort push in the mid-lane by Alliance, gaining two kills and an assist. This all but sealed the game and match for Team Liquid. KuroKy hasn't put up great numbers in The Shanghai Major and will need to improve if Team Liquid is going to win.

FEB. 29, 2016

KuroKy: Can't find consistency against Virtus.pro

Name: Kuro ""KuroKy"" Salehi Takhasomi

Team: Team Liquid

Update: KuroKy had a 4//13/35 KDA as Team Liquid fell 2-1 to Virtus.pro in the opening round of group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: KuroKy took a safe lane Tusk in Game One against Virtus.pro and had an efficient game, posting a 1/1/11 KDA. KuroKy did his job of enabling his carries, FATA and MATUMBAMAN, while dishing out a neat 4,100 damage. In Game Two, KuroKy picked up Tusk again but did not have similar results. KuroKy posted a 2/8/16 KDA in Team Liquid's loss to Virtus.pro. KuroKy dealt a decent amount of damage, blasting opponents for 5,700 but his deaths skyrocketed in the second tilt. In the make-or-break Game Three, KuroKy went with Enchantress and could not find success. KuroKy roamed around and posted a 1/4/8 KDA as Team Liquid fell 2-1 to Virtus.pro.

FATA: Solid play not enough for Team Liquid

Name: Adrian ""FATA"" Trinks

Team: Team Liquid

Update: FATA posted a 15/6/13 KDA during Team Liquid's 2-1 loss to Virtus.pro in the opening round of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: FATA showed why Invoker is a good pick in the mid lane at the Shanghai Major, recording a 5/1/9 KDA as Team Liquid defeated Virtus.pro in Game One of Group D games. FATA dealt the second most damage on his team, bashing opponents for 8,900 damage. FATA had his Invoker banned away in Game Two, but still had a powerful showing even though Team Liquid lost. FATA took Puck into the mid lane and produced. The mid laner went 7/2/10 while doing a game high 11,000 damage. FATA couldn't carry Team Liquid in Game Three either, as Virtus.pro took the series 2-1. FATA selected Phantom Lancer for the mid lane and earned a 3/3/4 KDA, doling out the second most damage on his team with 7,800.

JerAx: Slumps in final game against Virtus.pro

Name: Jesse ""JerAx"" Vainikka

Team: Team Liquid

Update: JerAx had a 8/16/30 KDA during Team Liquid's 2-1 loss to Virtus.pro in the opening round of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: JerAx played a safe lane Phoenix in Game One of Team Liquid's series against Virtus.pro in Group D. JerAx had a 1/2/13 KDA on the ranged champion, helping set up his teammates for flashy plays and fight control. JerAx, despite playing a low economy Phoenix, dished out 5,400 damage. JerAx got his Phoenix again in Game Two, but couldn't sustain Game One's success as Virtus.pro evened up the series. JerAx recorded a 6/6/13 KDA and pummeled opponents for 8,400 damage, but he tripled his deaths from the first game (six). JerAx borrowed Tusk away from his teammate KuroKy, who played the hero in Games One and Two. His showing wasn't strong, as he posted a 1/8/4 KDA during Team Liquid's series sealing loss to Virtus.pro.

MinD_ContRoL: Spotty play against Virtus.pro not enough

Name: Ivan ""MinD_ContRoL"" Borislavov

Team: Team Liquid

Update: MinD_ContRoL finished with a 10/10/23 in Team Liquid's 2-1 loss to Virtus.pro in the opening series of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: MinD_ContRoL roamed between the mid lane and the jungle on the Faceless Void as Team Liquid defeated Virtus.pro in Game One of Group D. MinD_ContRoL's KDA was 1/0/6, complimenting his team's Gyrocopter and Invoker to help Liquid to a 24-minute victory. Virtus.pro banned out MinD_ContRoL's Faceless Void in Game Two, pushing the jungler onto Nature's Prophet. MinD_ContRoL went 4/6/13, significantly upping his damage in the process, wailing on opponents for 7,000 damage. But after playing a squeaky clean Game One, MinD_ContRoL's deaths spiked in Game Two. MinD_ContRoL played a third unique hero in Game Three, taking Beastmaster into a top safe lane. He had a bounceback performance, but it wasn't enough as Liquid fell to Virtus.pro in Game Three. MinD_ContRoL went 5/4/4, dealing 3,600 damage to towers in the process.

MATUMBAMAN: Solid play doesn't translate into win against Virtus.pro

Name: Lasse ""MATUMBAMAN"" Urpalainen

Team: Team Liquid

Update: MATUMBAMAN had a 21/10/19 KDA as Team Liquid fell 2-1 to Virtus.pro in the opening round of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: MATUMBAMAN did the heavy carrying for Team Liquid in its Game One win over Virtus.pro in Group D. MATUMBAMAN nabbed Gyrocopter and went to work, racking up an impressive 11/2/4 KDA. MATUMBAMAN exploded for a game high 12,400 damage while collecting a monstrous amount of gold (16,800). Unfortunately, MATUMBAMAN did not have a repeat performance in Game Two, a loss. MATUMBAMAN played a safe lane Luna and while he did have a decent KDA, 5/4/9, he couldn't carry. He dealt 5,700 damage and hammered towers for 1,700 damage, but did not fully optimize his mountain of gold (18,700). MATUMBAMAN went with a safe lane Ursa in Game Three, but it didn't spell success for Liquid. MATUMBAMAN finished with a 5/4/6 KDA and led his team in damage (8,700), but he couldn't power Liquid to a series win over Virtus.pro.

fng: Steady and alert in Virtus.pro's win over Team Liquid

Name: Artsiom ""fng"" Barshack

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update: fng had a 5/13/24 KDA as Virtus.pro defeated Team Liquid 2-1 in the opening round of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: fng went with Chen in Virtus.pro's Game One loss to Team Liquid in Group D. The jungler went 1/5/1, perhaps only standing out for his 1,100 worth of healing. fng went with Winter Wyvern in Game Two and had a better KDA, going 2/4/10 as Virtus.pro evened the series at 1-1. fng's damage jumped to 7,300 thanks to the offlane pick. In Game Three, fng spent the game in the middle with Crystal Maiden, posting a 2/4/13 KDA and helping Virtus.pro claim its series against Team Liquid. fng made sure his mid laner had a big game.

Silent: Ramps up in 2-1 win over Team Liquid

Name: Airat ""Silent"" Gaziev

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update: Silent ended with a 19/7/16 KDA as Virtus.pro defeated Team Liquid 2-1 in the opening round of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Silent played a safe lane Spectre against Team Liquid during Game One of Virtus.pro's series in Group D. Silent had the best game of his comrades, which isn't saying much/ Silent had a 0/1/5 KDA and pumped out 4,200 damage while accumulating 11,100 gold, but Virtus.pro couldn't keep pace with Team Liquid. Silent opted for a safe lane Chaos Knight Game Two and it paid dividends. Silent finished with a 8/5/10 KDA, while pocketing 23,100 gold and crushing Team Liquid with 10,100 damage. Silent changed it up in Game Three, using a safe lane Sven to help Virtus.pro claim its series over Team Liquid. Silent went 11/1/6, dealing the most damage in the game with 11,900 and most tower damage with 5,000. Silent also earned an absurd 26,000 gold.

God: Ends series in style to defeat Team Liquid

Name: Sergey ""God"" Bragin

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update: God finished with a 15/11/16 KDA and Virtus.pro defeated Team Liquid 2-1 in the opening series of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: God had a tough time in the mid lane with his Death Prophet in Game One of Virtus.pro's series against Team Liquid to open up Group D. God displayed a 3/6/1 KDA, leading his team in damage with 6,400, but could not survive team fights and engagements, dying a game high six times. God switched to Templar Assassin in Game Two, carrying Virtus.pro to a win. God went 6/2/5 in the mid lane, dishing out 10,300 damage while rolling in 28,400 gold. In Game Three, God went back to his Game One pick: Death Prophet. This time, however, God excelled, finishing with a 6/3/10 KDA and blasting Liquid for 11,600 damage.

DkPhobos: Does a little bit of everything for Virtus.pro

Name: Alexander ""DkPhobos"" Kucheria

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update:DkPhobos had a 7/14/24 KDA and Virtus.pro defeated Team Liquid 2-1 in the opening round of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: DkPhobos posted a 1/4/4 KDA on Spirit Breaker during Virtus.pro's Game One loss to Team Liquid in the opening games of Group D. DkPhobos took Spirit Breaker into an offlane, but didn't have much success. He dealt 3,700 damage and healed allies for 707. DkPhobos' offlane prospects improved in Game Two when he posted a KDA of 4/6/8 as he played Dark Seer to a better success. DkPhobos healed teammates (1,600) while carving out some damage (5,100). In Game Three, Dkphobos went back to Dark Seer and played another solid game, finishing with a 2/4/12. His heals (1,300) helped his team survive and take down Liquid in the series clinching Game Three.

Lil: Strong play helps propel Virtus.pro

Name: Ilya ""Lil"" Ilyuk

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update: Lil recorded a 9/13/25 KDA as Virtus.pro defeated Team Liquid in the opening round of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Lil had a 1/3/3 KDA on Vengeful Spirit in Game One against Team Liquid in the opening series of Group D. Lil played a top lane support on Vengeful Spirit but couldn't find the right combinations to get Virtus.pro rolling. Lil broke out Io in Game Two and had a 6/7/13 KDA as Virtus.pro evened the series. Lil went hard with the heals (3,300), supporting his team out of a safe lane. Lil went with Oracle in Game Three and played the hero solidly, posting a 2/3/9 KDA. LIl healed his teammates for 2,300 and showed he could shave off a few deaths from Game Two as Virtus.pro won the series.

FEB. 28, 2016

Ramzes: Team Spirit hands Vici Gaming two game sweep

Name: Roman ""Ramzes"" Kushnarev

Team: Team Spirit

Update: Ramzes led his team to a pair of convincing victories, posting a KDA of 11/3/17 in the Shanghai Major lower bracket match.

Analysis: In Game One, Ramzes, playing the Chaos Knight offlane, dominated the entire game. Ramzes crushed with ten kills while also assisting in another eight. Ramzes only died once during the game, ensuring that he would be on the map plenty to secure farm. In Game Two, Ramzes took on a less aggressive role, this time playing the offlane Beastmaster. Ramzes was relied upon to give his team vision and lockdown in team fights. Ramzes participated in 10 of 23 kills, while also providing a nice pushing boost: racking up the second most tower damage in the game.

AfterLife: Team Spirit defeats Vici Gaming in a two game sweep

Name: Vasily ""AfterLife"" Shishkin

Team: Team Spirit

Update: AfterLife gave Team Spirit a boost playing two solid games, ending the series with a KDA of 16/2/19 in a Shanghai Major lower bracket match.

Analysis: In Game One, AfterLife, playing the safelane and farming Nature's Prophet, acted as the primary damage dealer for Team Spirit. AfterLife led all players in kills (11) while also dealing the most damage of any hero in the game: racking up over 16,000 points. In Game Two, AfterLife repeated his role as Nature's Prophet, this time taking his talents to the offlane. AfterLife played a very clean Game Two, only dying once and acting as a global initiator and lane pusher. He tallied five kills and had six assists.

Loda: Alliance rolls over FNATIC in 2-0 sweep in round two of Shanghai Major

Name: Jonathan ""Loda"" Berg

Team: Alliance

Update: Loda set the pace with a dominant performance in Game One, ending the series with a KDA of 19/8/29.

Analysis: Loda, playing the safe lane Spectre, was the alpha dog in Game One. Loda racked up 15 kills to lead all players, as well as topping the farming charts, leading all players in XPM (534) and GPM(695) . The Spectre pick played right into an underlying global strategy of Alliance, as they also had S4 Zeus to follow up any initiations. In Game Two, Loda, playing the safe lane Drow Ranger, had noticeably less of an impact than in Game One, but still played a solid game. Loda tallied 13 assists, but just couldn't seem to find the last hit on many heroes, as he only had three kills.

AdmiralBulldog: Alliance rolls over FNATIC in 2-0 sweep in round two of Shanghai Major

Name: Henrik ""AdmiralBulldog"" Ahnberg

Team: Alliance

Update: AdmiralBulldog combined with Loda to lead Alliance to a sweep of FNATIC, posting a KDA of 20/6/21.

Analysis: In Game One, Bulldog, playing the offlane Beastmaster, was relegated to more of a utility role, focusing on executing in team fights and providing game and map awareness with vision from his hawk. In Game One he tallied a respectable KDA of 4/4/11, but his true wrath would be felt in Game Two. In Game Two, Bulldog, playing the offlane Weaver, found himself in a much more active role than his previous game. Bulldog tallied 16 kills to lead all players, as well as providing a nice pushing presence, as Bulldog racked up nearly 7000 points of tower damage. Bulldog also managed to assist on an additional ten kills, giving him a hand in 26 of 29 of Alliance's kills.

Limmp: Goes big early but can't get back on track

Name: Linus ""Limmp"" Blomdin

Team: compLexity Gaming

Update: Limmp was superb in Game One, but couldn't sustain his push, totaling a 18/13/15 KDA in a 1-2 loss in the opening round of Group D play at The Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Limmp, playing Tiny, occupied mid lane in Game One and cascaded to a 16/3/12 KDA. He dominated EG's Suma1L in mid lane going five kills and 2 assists against his counterpart. His dominance in mid lane was crucial to the Game One win. Limmp would use Tiny again in Game Two hoping to reproduce the same results as Game One. This wasn't the case as he didn't register a single kill going 0/3/1 KDA in a game he would probrobably like to forget. In the third and deciding game, Limmp chose Morphling, but was countered by Suma1L's Lina in the mid. Limmp was again pushed back mid lane managing a 2/7/2 KDA.

Chessie: Plays conservatively in compLexity's 1-2 loss to Evil Geniuses

Name: Rasmus ""Chessie"" Blomdin

Team: compLexity Gaming

Update: Chessie toiled to a 10/11/15 KDA in compLexity Gaming's loss in Group D bracket play in The Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Chessie, roaming bottom lane with Phantom Lancer, was second on the team in kills with eight in Game One of Saturday's contest. Chessie also pulled off three multi-kills and went on a killing spree of five picking up 20,300 gold using that to purchase items to increase his speed. Games Two and Three were identical in KDA with a 1/4/1 and unfortunately so were the game losses. There appears to be a pattern developing with Chessie in terms of having a great Game One and then stuttering down the stretch.

Handsken: Very little killing and farming make for hard day in loss to EG

Name: Simon ""Handsken"" Haag

Team: compLexity Gaming

Update: Handsken didn't get much going, limping to a 6/18/15 KDA in compLexity's 1-2 loss to Evil Geniuses in Group D play of The Shanghai Major.

Analysis: In an interesting pick, Handsken chose Io in Game One and used the wisp very well tethering himself to Tiny (Limmp) in the middle lane. Spirits was maxed out by level seven and was used brilliantly to harass enemy heroes gaining a KDA of 4/6/11. But as most of compLexity gaming's heroes, Handsken was denied any kills in Game Two and could only manage two in Game Three. Handsken will look to rebound when compLexity takes on Spirit in the first round of The Shanghai Major Finals next week.

FEB. 26, 2016

ShiKi: Plays well in Group A match at The Shanghai Major

Name: Huang ""ShiKi"" Jiwei

Team: CDEC Gaming

Update: Shiki posted a respectable KDA of 15/8/14 as the lone bright spot in a losing effort for CDEC.

Analysis: In Game One, Shiki played the middle lane with Puck and dominated the entire match. His presence was felt throughout Game One as he bullied the opposing OD in lane and then carried the momentum throughout the rest of the match. Shiki tallied a KDA of 8/1/10 en route to a Game One CDEC victory. The victory would be short lived however, as Shiki threw up a stinker of a Game Two, playing the safe lane with Razor.

Shiki ended the game without a single kill and only one assist while dying four times in the 24 minute match. In Game Three, Shiki rebounded and put on a strong showing for his team, but couldn't manage to come away with the victory. Shiki played Lina middle lane and was the only player keeping CDEC afloat. Shiki tallied seven kills, good enough for second most. Shiki also also tallied the second most Hero Damage, with 10,300.

oldchicken: Stellar match lands big numbers at The Shanghai Major

Name: Wang ""oldchicken"" Zhiyong

Team: Ehome

Update: oldchicken proved his worth pecking his way to a solid KDA of 28/15/29.

Analysis: In Game One, oldchicken, playing the mid lane OD, was the raid boss for EHOME, tallying 17 kills in a bloodbath of a game that featured 76 total kills. oldchicken was also one of the top farmers by the end of the match, coming in second in both XPM (584) and GPM (508). Game Two saw oldchicken heading into the offlane as Death Prophet, which predictably didn't end well. oldchicken tallied just three kills in a disappointing Game Two performance as EHOME dropped the game to CDEC.

In Game Three, oldchicken returned to form dominating the game, utilizing the Warlock mid lane. oldchicken was second in the game in total kills with eight, while scoring another ten assists. oldchicken was able to shine in EHOME's team fight centric lineup.

Jeyo: Lone bright spot in Archon's 0-2 loss to OG at The Shanghai Major

Name: Jio ""Jeyo"" Madayag

Team: Team Archon

Update: Jeyo managed a team best 11/9/11 KDA against OG in a 0-2 loss at The Shanghai Major on Friday.

Analysis: Jeyo led Archon in kills with four tabulating a 4/3/3 KDA in Game One playing top lane. However, because of the buckling defense in mid lane, Jeyo was mostly on the defensive and couldn't get much going. Game Two was a little better for Jeyo, due to some reckless play from OG in the mid lane allowing Jeyo to earn a respectable 7/6/8 KDA with Outworld Devourer. He ended the game with a multi-kill and posted a killing spree of three.

monkeys-forever: Poor selection dooms Archon in The Shanghai Major

Name: Jaron ""monkeys-forever"" Clinton

Team: Team Archon

Update: monkeys-forever could not have gotten off to a worse start with a 4/13/11 KDA in Archon's 0-2 loss to OG in Group C play at The Shanghai Major on Friday.

Analysis: In Game One, monkeys-forever was shutout from any kills as Jakiro while playing in the mid lane. Jakiro, normally used in support, had a terrible match-up against OG's Lone Druid (Miracle) and simply couldn't compete. He ended Game One with a KDA of 0/6/3, leading Archon in deaths. Game Two wasn't much better as monkeys-forever again led Archon in deaths with seven (4/7/8), but did manage to get in on a few garbage time assists, totaling eight. monkeys-forever put himself at a disadvantage from the start, selecting Ember Spirit who simply cannot melee at high levels. Head-scratching selections seemingly doomed monkeys-forever from the very beginning.

BigDaddy: Solid match lifts OG to win over Archon

Name: Johan ""BigDaddy"" Sundstein

Team: OG

Update: BigDaddy was an all-around performer for OG posting a 12/8/23 KDA in OG's 2-0 win over Archon in The Shanghai Major on Friday.

Analysis: BigDaddy, playing Batrider to a 4/2/10 KDA in Game One, used his speed to harass and hinder enemies in the mid and bottom lanes. BigDaddy seemed to be particularly interested in Archon's Nature's Prophet who he killed once and assisted in three other kills in an attempt to get him to use his teleportation on defense.

In Game Two, BigDaddy switched to offense, going mid lane, selecting Zeus. With Zeus, BigDaddy dished out massive amounts of damage (23,100) and led all players in kills with eight. This was a very solid match for BigDaddy as OG continues its upward climb at The Shanghai Major.

MoonMeander: A little reckless in OG's sweep win over Archon

Name: David ""MoonMeander"" Tan

Team: OG

Update: MoonMeander had a two-game combined KDA of 5/10/22 in OG's 2-0 first round win over Archon in a Group C match on Friday.

Analysis: MoonMeander was reckless in both games of this contest as he was caught on multiple occasions in Archon ganks. Using Weaver in Game One, he was decidedly average posting in the middle of the pack in just about very statistical category with a 3/2/8 KDA . In Game Two, playing Batrider, he was caught out early and often, becoming first death very early at 1:08.

Although MoonMeander was second in assists with 14, he led his own team deaths with eight - ultimately forcing him out of action for for 4 minutes and 38 seconds. This was part of the reason the second game lasted much longer that the first. MoonMeander is still going to get numbers in terms of assists, but will need to throttle back on the headstrong rush.

Fly-Simba-: Plays support role in OG's sweep over Archon

Name: Tai ""Fly-Simba-"" Aizik

Team: OG

Update: Fly-Simba played well in support from the top safe lane with a 9/5/18 KDA in OG's match against Archon on Friday.

Analysis: The constant in Fly-Simba's style for both games of this match was his ability to place Observer and Sentry Wards throughout the map in order to get good vision on his enemies. He worked this in Game One, placing seven Observer and four Sentry Wards and placed 10 Sentry and nine Observer Wards in Game Two.

In Game Two, while still placing wards, Fly-Simba transitioned to more of a damaging support role (74 percent kill participation) primarily because of Archon's banning of Lone Druid, who had been ridiculously effective in Game One. Fly-Simba rallied to a KDA of 6/1/11, playing and ganking from the top lane. This was a strong match for Fly-Simba, but remember, the kills and assist might not always be there depending on what type of support role is needed.

Miracle: Complete domination in Round One of Group C

Name: Amer ""Miracle"" Barqawi

Team: OG

Update: Miracle went off, dominating the field in just about every category boasting a 13/2/10 KDA in OG's victory over Archon on Friday.

Analysis: Miracle led all players in gold (44,600), denies (38), last hits (580), and tower damage (13,700). He was absolutely dominate in Game One with a KDA of 7/0/5, playing Lone Druid. Miracle landed a great triple kill at the 18 minute mark and teamed up with his bear, to earn a killing spree of seven. Game Two was more of the same. Miracle was banned out of Lone Druid, but came back selecting Phantom Lancer and his ranged attack to pester enemy players and towers. Miracle, in an almost RPG-like frame of mind, used his farming abilities to gain significant level and item advantages throughout this 2-0 match win over Archon.

Cr1t: Dominates all players in assists in Group C play

Name: Andreas ""Cr1t"" Nielsen

Team: OG

Update: Cr1t played a very aggressive style scoring a 6/9/28 KDA in OG's Round One win over Archon in Group C action at The Shanghai Major on Friday.

Analysis: In Game One Cr1t chose Earthshaker using multiple area of effect attacks in order to stun and damage multiple Archon opponents. Cr1t drew a quick first blood at nearly three minutes into the game and had a killing spree of three right at the eight minute mark. Cr1t took part in 82 percent of the total kills in Game One.

In Game Two, playing Elder Titan, Cr1t was a little too aggressive getting caught early for some deaths, but rebounded to lead all players with 15 assists. Cr1t played the support role from close and afar sending out Astral Spirit and buying items such as Dust of Appearance to slow opponents so his teammates could level them. Cr1t will look to continue his assist gathering ways during this tournament.

eLeVeN: Negative KDA dooms EHOME in Group A bottom bracket loss to Team Secret

Name: Yang ""eLeVeN"" Wei Ren

Team: Ehome

Update: eLeVen had an off night with his 4/10/9 KDA in a two game loss to Team Secret in The Shanghai Major tournament on Thursday.

Analysis: eLeVen simply couldn't put it together in Game One playing Night Stalker at top easy, going 0/6/3. Team Secret's EternaLEnVy chased eLeVen on both sides of the map getting three kills against eLeVen. While Game Two was an improvement, it still wasn't enough to get a win with eLeVen limping to a 4/4/6 KDA. He was a full item behind the rest of his team and simply couldn't catch up after falling behind. EHOME and ELeVeN are 5-5 in their last 10 matches.

w33: Solid play lifts Team Secret over EHOME

Name: Aliwi ""w33"" Omar

Team: Team Secret

Update: w33 was instrumental in Team Secret's win over EHOME with a 11/6/10 KDA in the bottom bracket final at The Shanghai Major on Thursday.

Analysis: After being banned from Broodmother in Game One, w33 came up big with Windranger getting up to level 17 with a KDA of 6/2/7. w33 also ranked first on the team with 11 denies and 19,300 gold. As the Windranger, w33 bottled up mid lane and then sealed the win in Game One with a double-kill at 34:15 on the Ancient rush. In Game Two, w33 was a little underwhelming as Invoker, which surprisingly wasn't banned, but grinded out some kills going 5/4/3 again holding down mid lane. This was another good performance in this tournament.

EternaLEnVy: Plays tough but not enough to overcome MVP Phoenix in Group A Finals

Name: Jacky ""EternaLEnVy"" Mao

Team: Team Secret

Update: EternaLEnVy put together a mild 7/9/8 KDA in their Group A Finals loss to MVP Phoenix at The Shanghai Major on Thursday.

Analysis: Not a whole lot to speak of here as Team Secret was absolutely dismantled. EternaLEnVy was banned from both Zues and Lion in Game One and settled in with Gyrocopter, going 2/4/1 in the bottom lane. Game Two was much of the same with EternaLEnVy going with Tiny holding down mid. Perhaps a little frustration came into play accounting for the five deaths he suffered at the hands of MVP Phoenix leading to a death time of 2:34. EternaLEnvy finished with a 5/5/7 in Game Two.

MP: Plays top and bottom lanes in victory over Secret in Group A final

Name: Pyo ""MP"" No-a

Team: MVP Phoenix

Update: MP played a solid match taking turns on the top and bottom lanes with a 10/3/18 KDA in their Group A finals win over Secret at The Shanghai Major on Thursday.

Analysis: In Game One, MP was banned out of Broodmother and chose Juggernaut to roam at top safe. MP maxed out Blade Fury by level seven and pushed the top lane hard into Radiant territory. By 16 minutes, MP had his Omnislash working mid lane slaying Radiant players, gaining a MVP Phoenix win in a mere 18 minutes. Secret banned Broodmother from MP in Game 2, so pivoted to Leshrac and racked up better numbers with a 6/3/10 KDA. Farming effectively, MP led in gold with 13.600 and tied in kill participation at 80 percent. MP's aggressive play should continue to rack up kills and assists as this tournament continues.

QO: Unstoppable in group stage win over EHOME

Name: Kim ""QO"" Seon-yeop

Team: MVP Phoenix

Update: QO went an astonishing 23/2/16 in MVP Phoenix's drubbing of EHOME in a 2-0 first round win during the group stages of The Shanghai Major on Thursday.

Analysis: QO was simply superior in both games of the match. Using Ember Spirit, he scored his first kill at the six second mark of Game One and was so effective that there were zero EHOME kills that took place on MVP Phoenix's side of the map. QO farmed heavily in Game One utilizing 148 last hits while leading all players with 14,453 gold, allowing item buys early and often. Game Two was even better for QO. In the top safe lane playing Slark, QO went 13/1/10 with a three player multi-kill and a seven player killing spree in an absolute rout of EHOME. QO would end up being the top leveler in both games.

BurNIng: Hot and cold play dooms Vici Gaming to Round One loss

Name: Xu ""BurNIng"" Zhilei

Team: VICI Gaming

Update: Burning put together a 14/9/13 KDA during Vici Gaming's 2-1 series loss in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: BurNing got rich with his safe lane Sven, but gave away a few kills in the process, going 5/5/6 against Fnatic in Game One of the Group A series. BurNing led the game in gold earned with 31,900. BurNing came back to play a safe lane Morphling in Game Two, bagging piles of gold as Vici Gaming took down Fnatic. BurNing horded 23,600 gold and dealt the second most damage on his team with 10,000 with the ranged carry, finishing with a perfect 9/0/7 KDA. BurNing was decidedly outplayed in Game Three, dying four times while Fnatic defeated Vici Gaming and claimed the series. BurNing played a mid lane Bristleback in Game Three, going 0/4/0 and dealing a paltry 2,300 damage. He once again earned the most gold on his team (9,500) but it wasn't enough to spark Vici Gaming.

Super!: Shines on Invoker, flounders on Razor in loss to Fnatic

Name: Xie ""Super!"" Junhao

Team: VICI Gaming

Update: Super! had a 13/5/23 KDA during Vici Gaming's 2-1 series loss in the group stage at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Super! played like his namesake with a walloping 16,500 damage as Invoker in Game One against Fnatic, which Vici Gaming lost. In that game, the mid laner was the lone bright spot, going 6/2/11 while netting the second most gold on his team at 25,000. He also led his team in tower damage with 3,200, the second most in the game. Super! got better in Game Two with Invoker, recording a flawless game with a 6/0/12 KDA. Super! once again demonstrated his power, dealing 14,000 damage, the most in the game. The VG player had his Invoker drafted away from him in Game Three, opting to play safe lane Razor. Unfortunately, it did not go over well. Super! went 1/3/0 and only managed to deal 3,500 damage. Without Invoker, Super! lost his strength.

IceIceIce: Inconsistent during Vici Gaming's 2-1 series loss to Fnatic

Name: Koh ""IceIceIce"" Pei Xiang

Team: VICI Gaming

Update: IceIceIce posted a 10/11/25 KDA during Vici Gaming's 2-1 series loss in the group stage at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Vici Gaming's IceIceIce opened Game One against Fnatic with Batrider and made some great initiations, which he couldn't maintain. He finished with a 3/5/11 KDA and dished out the third most damage on his team at 8,400. IceIceIce reversed his puny impact from Game One with a 5/3/14 KDA in Game Two. He dealt 9,900 damage on Elder Titan (again good for third most on this team), steadying his performance overall. IceIceIce managed to deal the most damage on his team in Game Three, except it was only 6,500 and Vici Gaming lost. IceIceIce played a safe lane Broodmother and had the best game on his team, going 2/3/0 during Vici Gaming's 22-minute loss. He dealt the most damage to towers on his team with 1,400, but couldn't do enough to keep Vici Gaming from falling 2-1 in the series.

Fenrir: Falls off in the mid lane against Fnatic

Name: Lu ""Fenrir"" Chao

Team: VICI Gaming

Update: Fenrir had a 4/16/20 KDA during Vici Gaming's 2-1 series loss in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Fenrir used a safe lane Tusk in Vici Gaming's Game One loss to Fnatic. Fenrir didn't hit the mark with Tusk, dying nine times en route to a 1/9/10 game. Fenrir swapped out Tusk for a safe lane Earth Spirit in Game Two against Fnatic, and it worked. Fenrir finished with a 3/5/10 KDA, aptly playing his role and emphasizing his teammates' strengths. Fenrir went with Witch Doctor in Game Three and didn't accomplish much. The VG player went 0/2/0 from the mid lane, recording the lowest amount of gold on his team (3,900). Fenrir never fully tapped into Witch Doctor's damage dealing potential, hitting enemies for only 399 damage, while not opting to tech into any heals.

fy: Can't find rhythm against Fnatic

Name: Xu ""fy"" Linsen

Team: VICI Gaming

Update: Fy had a 4/12/26 KDA during Vici Gaming's 2-1 series loss in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: fy started with a safe lane Phoenix in Game One of this Group A opening match. fy went 3/5/12, standing out with some of his ranged abilities and initiations. With his Phoenix pick he was able to provide 1,400 points of healing to his team. Fy busted out a Winter Wyvern in Game Two and went 1/3/13 in Vici Gaming's bounce back win. fy turned around his performance from Game One, dying less and aiding his team with critical engages.

fy geared up with another unique champion in Game Three, as he used Night Stalker in the jungle. While the hero selection was certainly interesting, fy didn't post positive results, finishing with a 0/4/1 KDA in the series-ending loss.

Ohaiyo: Lone Druid banned, goes perfect on Tidehunter against Vici Gaming

Name: Chong Xin ""Ohaiyo"" Khoo

Team: Fnatic

Update: Ohaiyo had a 10/9/21 KDA during Fnatic's 2-1 series win over Vici Gaming in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Ohaiyo began the series against Vici Gaming with Lone Druid, and went off in the first game. The offlane carry dealt a huge amount of tower damage, hammering down structures for 4,500 damage. Ohaiyo grabbed the most gold on his team with 27,600, earning a neat KDA of 2/3/13 in Fnatic's opening win over Vici Gaming. Ohaiyo got his Lone Druid in an offlane again in Game Two, but floundered as Fnatic fell to Vici Gaming. Ohaiyo went 5/6/2, while earning the most gold on his team at 16,600.

His tower damage fell off significantly (1,000) in Game Two, as Fnatic was unable to generate much pushing power. Ohaiyo couldn't pick up Lone Druid for Game Three after Vici Gaming banned it, but it turns out, Ohaiyo's Tidehunter is pretty good, too. Ohaiyo went 3/0/6 with his different offlane pick as Fnatic went on to score the series victory.

net: Forces Shadow Shaman ban, still delivers in Game Three

Name: Wai ""net"" Pern Lim

Team: Fnatic

Update: Net had an 8/8/26 KDA during Fnatic's 2-1 series win over Vici Gaming in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Net opened Game One with an offlane Shadow Shaman and posted a staggering 7/2/10 KDA in Fnatic's win over Vici Gaming. Net made the most of his limited resources, only reaching level 16, but still racked up seven kills. Net moved into the jungle for Game Two with his Shadow Shaman, but the end result left much to be desired. Net went 0/4/9, unable to maximize his limited resources. Net had his Shadow Shaman banned away from him in Game Three, taking a safe lane Disruptor in its stead. Net went 1/2/7, posting what was essentially a middle of the road game for him.

Miduan: Up and down day enough for Fnatic

Name: Nai Zheng ""Miduan"" Yeik

Team: Fnatic

Update: Miduan had a 10/11/26 KDA during Fnatic's 2-1 series win over Vici Gaming in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: In Game One, Miduan made good use of Nyx Assassins' early game, initiating fights correctly and escaping sticky situations. Miduan finished 4/5/14 in the first game of the series, but dealt the second highest amount damage of his team at 10,100. The stealth from the Assassin in particular allowed Fnatic to have slightly more vision and the team benefited from it, winning the first game. Miduan took a step backward in Game Two on a mid lane Puck.

Miduan died six times, and was unable to provide much of a punch offensively, earning only one kill and assisting in just eight. Miduan finished with over 6,000 less gold than his counterpart, Super. He did manage to deal the lion's share of his team's damage with 9,900. Fnatic took away Fenrir's Invoker in Game Three, and Miduan proved he had the chops for the hero, too. Miduan went 5/0/4, leading Fnatic over Vici Gaming. Miduan did the most damage in the game with 9,700 and he also managed to record the second most gold with 14,300.

DJ: Good Chen play helps Fnatic to clinch series

Name: Djardel ""DJ"" Mampusti

Team: Fnatic

Update: DJ had a 6/11/20 KDA during Fnatic's 2-1 series win over Vici Gaming in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: DJ took Chen into the jungle in Game One and dished out heals. Although the jungler didn't put up an eye-popping KDA, he went 2/3/8, and was a consistent factor in revitalizing his team, healing allies for 5,300. Chen proved to be a theme for DJ in Game Two, although his impact seemingly diminished. DJ went 0/7/6 in Game Two, again healing for a decent amount (2,000), but not nearly as much as Game One. Game Three found DJ using Chen for a third consecutive time, helping Fnatic seal its series win over Vici Gaming. DJ only died once and also dealt a decent amount of damage (4,800), posting a 4/1/6 KDA.

Mushi: Three unique champions help deliver Fnatic series win in Group B

Name: Chai ""Mushi"" Yee Fung

Team: Fnatic

Update: Mushi had an 18/8/13 KDA during Fnatic's 2-1 series win over Vici Gaming in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Mushi pulled out a safe lane Silencer in Game One of Group B and dominated. Mushi rolled to a game high 11 kills, finishing with a 11/5/8 KDA. Mushi's global presence with Silencer gave Fnatic the right engagements and proper disengagements to take advantageous skirmishes. Mushi denied a game high 41 farm to go along with his team high damage, around 11,200. He also brought in the most gold, with 24,400.

As a result Fnatic took the opening game. In Game Two, Mushi used a safe lane Necrophos to some success, but Fnatic dropped the game. Mushi went 5/3/1 and stood out with his healing (2,200, most in the game). Mushi grabbed Sven in a safe lane for the series-deciding Game Three, as Fnatic took down Vici Gaming. Mushi posted a perfect game, going 2/0/4 and dealing a blistering 4,300 damage on the carry. He also racked up the most gold in the game with 16,400.

S4 led the way for Alliance as he racked up the most kills in the match (11), while also leading in both the GPM (549) and XPM (642) charts. In Game Two, S4 again led Alliance to victory on the back of a second consecutive flawless performance. Playing the mid lane Tiny, S4 led all players in total kills with seven.

Name: Artour ""Arteezy"" Babaev

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: Arteezy put together a pair of strong performances in EG's two victories in the series, managing to post a strong KDA of 18/6/25.

Analysis: In Game One nothing was stopping Arteezy. Playing the safelane Morphling, Arteezy seemed to be in complete control of the match. Ending the game with by far the most kills (12), Arteezy was spectacular in Game One. In addition to his impressive kill numbers, Arteezy also found himself atop the farming statistics, leading in GPM (729) as well as XPM (649). Game Two, however, was a different story. Arteezy, playing the safelane Lone Druid, and the rest of the EG squad, just couldn't seem to gather their footing, as they were outplayed by the LGD in a Game Two loss. Game Three saw a return to form for EG and Arteezy, as he aligned once again with the safelane Lone Druid, providing valuable space around the map as he constantly pressured lanes and found his farm, ending the game with the second highest GPM (655).

Maybe ended the game with a flawless KDA (10/0/10) and led all players with his 10 kills. Maybe was also the gold leader in Game One, amassing over 17,000 in the victory. Game Two was not a game to remember for the LGD squad, however, as they couldn't gain any momentum throughout the match. Maybe, playing the mid lane Razor, proved to be relatively ineffective, only managing to involve himself in two total kills. Game Three saw the resurgence of the Maybe from Game One, as the player again posted a flawless KDA(7/0/10), carrying his team to a decisive victory on the back of his safelane Gyrocopter.

Team: OG

Update: Miracle again leads OG to an easy series victory, paving the way with a KDA of 12/3/10.

Analysis: In an incredibly short Game One, with a total game time of only 26:09, Miracle's presence was felt throughout. Miracle, on the midlane Outworld Devourer, provided OG with a valuable damage dealer, racking up the second most total damage in the game (8,600). Miracle was very active throughout the course of the game, as he found himself involved in 11 of 22 total kills, snagging five of those kills for himself. In Game Two, Miracle, playing the safelane Morphling, again had another strong performance, as he led all players in kills (7), GPM (729), and XPM (507).

In Game Two, Miracle playing as a mid lane Invoker, again made his presence known throughout all stages of the game.

Team: OG

Update: BigDaddy crushed Newbee with a pair of impressive performances Thursday, posting a KDA of 19/4/15 in OG's series sweep of Newbee.

Analysis: In Game One, BigDaddy was a man on a mission, racking up the most total kills (12) as he controlled the game on back of his safe lane Tiny. BigDaddy, in Game One, managed to lead the way in nearly all statistical categories, including GPM (653), total gold (28,900), as well as total hero damage as he racked up over 15,000 points of damage.

Analysis: In Game One, SumaiL playing the mid lane Invoker, seemed to be involved in everything, as he found himself apart of 27 of 31 total kills, by far the most active kill participant of any player. SumaiL also led all players with some gaudy farming statistics with a GPM of 644 and XPM of 588. In Game Two, SumaiL again played a very active role, this time taking part inin 29 of 42 kills and once again leading in both GPM (669) and XPM (713) to boot.

Arteezy was also an important space provider, as his split pushing caused headaches for compLexity. In Game Two, Arteezy took over the reins as the safe lane Clinkz. He totaled the second highest amount of kills (12) as well as the second highest GPM (576) and XPM (622), on EG's way to a win over compLexity.

What's the best part about having two PGA Tour wins so far this season? And how does Adam Scott balance back-to-back victories while still striving for another green jacket at the Masters? He spoke to ESPN.com's Michael Collins after his win at Doral. (2:19)",[]
espn.com,,Reaction to Team Europe World Cup roster,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Dan Marrazza', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Sean Allen', 'John Buccigross', 'Sarah Goldstein', 'Scott Burnside', 'John Rosengren', 'Paul Grant']","While most eyes will be on Team North America in terms of how a disparate group of youngsters from competing nations will come together in a short period, the same dynamics exist on an even greater scale for Team Europe.

Seven different nations were represented by Wednesday's roster announcement. So the challenge for the coaching staff under both head coach Ralph Krueger and Winnipeg Jets head coach Paul Maurice, who will assist Krueger, is producing cohesion. What makes the job easier is that this is a team blessed with leaders from their respective NHL clubs.

In fact, one of the most difficult challenges for the coaching staff might be who to name captain among Zdeno Chara, Mark Streit, Anze Kopitar and Marian Hossa.

There is a good blend of speed and skill among the forward group and the defense will be led, skill-wise, by Roman Josi, who has emerged as a Norris Trophy-caliber defenseman in the past couple of seasons.

Editor's Picks World Cup of Hockey roster: Team Europe Anze Kopitar leads an all-star cast of players from disparate countries to form Team Europe.

But where the concern must lie for this group is durability and a lack of depth, especially along the blue line if players are unable to play.

Chara is 38. Hossa is 37. Dennis Seidenberg is 34. Streit is 38. All have battled injuries and there are potentially long playoff runs ahead for Hossa and maybe Chara and Seidenberg.

Up front, the one name absent from the initial list of 16 players is Stanley Cup-champion Marian Gaborik of the Los Angeles Kings. Gaborik has struggled offensively this season and is now out of action with injury.

Should he return and have a productive playoff for the Kings, it would be no surprise if Gaborik is among the final seven players named to the roster, although he will have competition from youngsters Nikolaj Ehlers and Tobias Rieder.

And, finally, in goal both Frederik Andersen and Jaroslav Halak have enjoyed stronger play of late and, in fact, Andersen is part of a resurgent Anaheim Ducks team that could once again enjoy a long playoff run.

It's not a stretch to suggest the goaltender that enjoys the most playoff success would establish him as the starter next fall and that the goaltending will say much about the team's ability to establish itself as a dark horse to go deep in the tournament.

Another element for Team Europe that will make them unique is that about half their roster -- basically all the players who are not from Slovakia and Switzerland -- will be playing in Olympic qualifying tournaments in various locations around Europe just before the start of World Cup training camp the first week of September.

GM Miroslav Satan said the qualifying tournaments could be helpful because it will give some of his players extra game time before the World Cup but it also raises the specter of injury.

Satan said there were as many as 10 scouts, coaches and management staff who had a voice in making roster decisions. They specifically did not look at the nationalities involved but rather wanted to pick the best players available to them. The same principles will be in place for the final seven players, Satan said, although he acknowledged these final picks might be the most difficult.

As for trying to form some sort of cohesion out of a group of players who hail from different nations, not to mention different NHL teams, Satan believes that the natural competitiveness that pro athletes like these possess will come through very quickly, even if Team Europe represents a new entity.

espn.com,,Hall of Fame tennis journalist Bud Collins dies at 86,"['Mark Hodgkinson', 'Peter Bodo', 'Greg Garber', 'Pa Sport', 'Espn Staff']","Bud Collins, who wrote his way into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, died Friday. He was 86.

Famous for his deep love of the game and for his colorful -- and sometimes outlandish -- style of dress, Collins was a writer for The Boston Globe and, beginning in 1968, an analyst for CBS and NBC. He helped popularize an under-the-radar sport for the emerging baby-boomer generation.

Editor's Picks Bodo: The immeasurable impact Bud Collins had on tennis Beyond his colorful, custom-made pants, Bud Collins fueled the boom of Open tennis as much as anyone in the game. But it's his kind, selfless soul we'll miss more than anything.

Social reaction: Remembering the legendary Bud Collins The sports universe paid tribute to the legendary Bud Collins, one of the most prominent, colorful and genuinely nice figures the game has ever seen. 1 Related

His wife, Anita Ruthling Klaussen, said that Collins died at home in Brookline, Massachusetts, after suffering from Parkinson's disease and dementia.

In 2015, the United States Tennis Association named the sprawling media center at its US Open site in his honor. The inscription on the plaque reads: ""Journalist, Commentator, Historian, Mentor, Friend.""

""The USTA is deeply saddened by the passing of legendary tennis journalist Bud Collins,"" read a statement from the USTA released Friday. ""Bud was larger than life, and his countless contributions to the sport helped to make it the global success that it is today. Bud was a mentor to many, and a friend to many more. Our sport was most fortunate to be associated with a man of such character and class, and we were privileged to have had the chance to honor his lasting legacy to the sport by naming the US Open Media Center in his honor last year. He will be sorely missed by all of us who loved him -- and by the sport he loved so dearly.""

Collins introduced the intricacies of the simple yet complex game, its heroes and the unrelenting rivalries they produced: Jimmy Connors and John McEnroe, Steffi Graf and Monica Seles, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert.

""He had a passion for the game and the players that was unmatched,"" Evert said. ""He brought a bright light and an oasis to the often pressure-filled and ego-oriented world of professional tennis. I would relax around his warmth and wit.

""He was family.""

Collins' journalistic reach went beyond tennis. He covered boxing as well and was one of the earlier chroniclers of Muhammad Ali.

Collins wore his heart on his sleeve -- and in those signature vibrant, colorful pants and zany bow ties, his uncommon passion for the sport was revealed.

He was also a media trailblazer. Collins was among the first major sportswriters to transition to television, opening a path for Lesley Visser, Peter Gammons and Chris Mortensen among many, many others. He is enshrined in the International Tennis Hall of Fame and a winner of the nation's highest sportswriting honor, the Red Smith Award.

""Through his writing, his television work, his constant promotion of the game, no one did more to grow the sport of tennis than Bud Collins,"" said Vince Doria, who worked closely with Collins for more than 20 years, first as sports editor at The Boston Globe and later as senior vice president for news at ESPN. ""The world will always view him in that light. But those who knew him best will remember that no one had a better friend than Bud Collins. And no one had more friends than Bud Collins.""

ESPN, for whom Collins worked in the 2000s, said in a prepared statement that Collins was ""a pioneering journalist"" who helped ""broaden the popularity of the sport he had played, had coached and loved.""

""He blazed a now well-worn path, making the transition from print to television, though Collins never left his typewriter behind,"" the statement read. ""Beloved and respected by all, he was as synonymous with outlandishly colorful outfits featuring specially made pants as much as he was for the clever nicknames he coined for players.""

Added former TV partner Dick Enberg: ""He was as colorful as his trousers, which were his signature. And yet it was really misleading to the average fan. That was his MO for television. In person, he was the quietest guy in the room. He laughed the most at somebody else's comment. He always had a smile and never dominated the conversation.''

He was a man, seemingly, from a different time. His classic prose came from the era of Damon Runyon and Grantland Rice. In his television musings, he would sometimes reference a fictitious ""Uncle Studley"" and a character named ""Fingers Fortesque.""

His epic -- ""The Bud Collins History of Tennis"" -- is the history of the sport.

Collins always called himself a ""hacker,"" but he could play the game, too. He was a nimble athlete who won the U.S. Indoor mixed doubles championship with Janet Hopps in 1961, and he was a finalist in the French Senior doubles with Jack Crawford in 1975. Collins was the tennis coach for five years at Brandeis University, where one of his players was future social activist Abbie Hoffman.

For years, he hosted a media tournament at the US Open in New York.

Collins is survived by his wife, who in recent years helped keep him connected to the sport he cherished, a handful of definitive books and, of course, generations of tennis fans who took their lead from the colorful character with the crazy pants.

""I am heartbroken at the news of the passing of Bud Collins, a great friend to me personally and an irreplaceable presence in the sport of tennis,"" USTA chairman Katrina Adams said in a statement. ""Bud was truly one of a kind, and his good humor and great grace, coupled with his unmatched knowledge of our sport and his love of it, helped to make tennis more popular and more fun for fans in the U.S, and throughout the world. He was a colorful character, a true gentleman and a passionate proponent of our sport, which was most fortunate to have counted Bud as a member of its family. There will never be another quite like Bud, and I know that our entire sport, its players, and its many fans deeply mourn his passing.""

Luongo was pulled from the Panthers' 5-4 overtime loss to the Boston Bruins after allowing four goals on 16 shots in the first period. He has now lost back-to-back starts

Is Claude Julien the coach of the year?

@Real_ESPNLeBrun: Shouldn't Claude Julien be in the conversation for the Jack Adams Award, given to the league's coach of the year? A 5-4 overtime win against the Florida Panthers moved Julien past Art Ross to become the Boston Bruins' all-time wins leader with 388. It was also yet another key win in a surprising season for a team that many, including myself, predicted during the preseason would take a step back as a public retooling took place under first-year GM Don Sweeney. As you may remember, Julien's future hung in the air for a good six weeks last offseason before Sweeney announced Julien was coming back as coach. Smart move by Sweeney, because a first-year GM should always keep his first coaching change in his back pocket as long as he can. Still, Julien was seen by many as candidate to be fired if things went off the rails this season, and deep down he probably felt the same way. And I know of a few teams that were ready to pounce on him if that happened. Thing is, he's just so good a coach that he has the Bruins overachieving. What say you, gang?

@ESPN_Burnside: I was thinking about our post-trade deadline assessment of the Bruins as Lee Stempniak delivered the winner against the Panthers on Monday night. Seeing Sweeney send out a second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-round pick (plus a prospect) to bring in pending free agents Stempniak (who added two assists in Monday's win) and John-Michael Liles (who collected an assist on Stempniak's game winner) seemed a bit counterintuitive for a team that looked to be stockpiling assets. But here the Bruins are, tied with Florida at 81 points, and just a point back of the first-place Tampa Bay Lightning in the compressed Atlantic Division. Could Julien lead the Bruins to another division title? Sure, but either way this is a team that looks like it's going to be a handful come playoff time. I still think the Washington Capitals' Barry Trotz and the Anaheim Ducks' Bruce Boudreau, who squared off in a dynamite game in Anaheim on Monday night, will be in the discussion, as will the Chicago Blackhawks' Joel Quenneville. Still, I think it's fair to say the Bruins are one of the most surprising teams headed down the stretch towards the playoffs.

@CraigCustance: One of the things I'm looking for in a coach of the year candidate is a guy who has cultivated growth and improvement in a group throughout the season, and there's no doubt Julien has done that in Boston. You mentioned this season perhaps being a step back in Boston, Pierre, but I wonder if that's being reconsidered now, especially with the way management handled the trade deadline. You don't trade a slew of draft picks if you're truly in the middle of retooling of the organization. Julien has done a fantastic job this season in Boston and definitely should be in consideration, although if I'm giving it to an Eastern Conference coach, it's Trotz. Still, you can't go wrong with either selection.

@ESPNJoeyMac: Julien should undoubtedly be a serious contender for the Jack Adams. Until last season, the Bruins knew nothing but consistency under Julien, and Bruins owner Jeremy Jacons said during a conversation in December that he applauded the job by Julien, and said the coach should be a candidate for the Jack Adams. Julien has dealt with a restructuring of the organization, both on and off the ice, and the roster is completely different during this soft rebuild. Boston is still in the playoff structure, though, and should earn a postseason berth. Many believe Julien's job would once again be at risk if the team went one-and-done in the playoffs, and if that was the case it wouldn't take him long to land another job. Imagine if he ended up back with the Montreal Canadiens? The Bruins have survived this season for a few reasons, but you have to give Julien his kudos. I wasn't in Florida for that game Monday, but I'm sure Julien said he was humbled by his accomplishment. All he needs now is a few more championships to catch up to the status of Bill Belichick in Boston.

espn.com,,UCI president Brian Cookson discusses recent WorldTour reforms,"['Roger Robinson', 'Caley Fretz', 'Greg Garber', 'Sarah Gearhart']","Editor's note: This Q&A originally appeared at VeloNews.com

In the debate over cycling's impending WorldTour reform, Tour de France owner ASO stands quite alone.

Though the broad discussion about cycling's future is full of smaller quarrels, and stakeholders make different allies in each individual fight, there remains a distinct line between ASO and others: the UCI, tour teams, and even fellow race organizers.

""Whilst one group of organizers -- I won't beat around the bush, it's ASO -- seem to be a little bit unhappy, and I'm quite puzzled by their position, the majority of the rest of the WorldTour organizers are pretty happy,"" UCI president Brian Cookson said of the recently approved reform package.

""I've spoken with the guys from Flanders Classics, and Tour de Suisse, [Giro d'Italia organizer] RCS, just to name a few, and they're very supportive of where we're going,"" he said.

A final compromise between the sides came out of this week's discussions in Barcelona: The UCI and teams won an important victory in the evolution of WorldTour license to three-year guarantees, but the sport of cycling will not see any of the other major changes discussed since the end of previous president Pat McQuaid's tenure.

VeloNews called President Cookson on Wednesday morning to ask what exactly happened in Barcelona? Is this a reform at all? Does ASO hold too much power?

The following is a transcript of that conversation, edited only slightly for clarity.

VeloNews: Most of the proposals we've seen over the last three years were not passed. Is this reform, or just a reconfirmation of what cycling already is?

Brian Cookson: I think what's happened is that the proposals that were part of the 2013 reforms that I inherited, it became pretty clear quite early on that these were not proposals that had universal or even widespread support, either amongst the organizers or amongst the teams. When bits of those proposals got out into the public domain the fans weren't particularly happy about it, either.

So what we've done over the last two years is revisit all of it. Really try to see what the issues are; what can we do to move things forward. Clearly, our view was that the 2013 proposals were trying to fit cycling into a kind of straitjacket that might work for other sports but might have been damaging to our sport.

We've come up with a range of proposals that are an evolution, not a revolution.

We're not insisting there are no overlaps in the calendar; we are making sure that there aren't more than two races at a time.

We're not looking at forcing events to reduce the number of days. If you recall, the original proposal was to bring the calendar down to 120 days [of racing], so events like the Vuelta would lose a week. They weren't very happy about that.

There are other events, like the Tour of Turkey, that would love to be part of the WorldTour and have a legitimate claim to be so.

This idea of the best riders in the best events all the time will never work for our sport. That's a misunderstanding. The best riders for the classics are not the best riders for the grand tours. We'd love to see Tour de France riders in Paris-Roubaix, but the idea that you can force riders, in the modern era, to ride races that don't suit them and don't suit their preparation just doesn't work.

I think we've come up with something that will move things forward very positively. So the teams will get a strong basis, they'll have a three-year license provided they comply with the requirements. The races will also have three-year licenses as well.

Forcing all top riders to take part in cobbled one-day classics like Paris-Roubaix is not an option for the UCI, says president Brian Cookson. Bryn Lennon/Getty Images

The teams won't be forced to reduce their numbers, so nobody will be thrown out of a job because of these proposals. There will be a development team as part of each team as well, so that will manage the process of bringing new riders into the WorldTour and developing them with the right sort of guidance.

I think, when I look around the room at the proposals, it seemed to me that the majority of people believed these will be good proposals that will be workable. If we had not changed our proposals, there would have been no point in having these additional discussions.

VN: There were still points of contention leading into Barcelona. What were they?

BC: Well, no one until we did the presentations and discussions at the start of the seminar, nobody had a clear picture of all of the proposals, and how they balanced out, and how they would work. That was helpful from everyone's point of view.

It's no secret that one group of the organizers were less than happy about the direction of things. But actually, if you talk to other groups of organizers, the WorldTour organizers, you'll find that they're pretty happy.

So whilst one group of organizers -- I won't beat around the bush, it's ASO -- seem to be a little bit unhappy, and I'm quite puzzled by their position, actually, the majority of the rest of the WorldTour organizers are pretty happy. As are those organizers who think they might have an opportunity to get into the WorldTour.

So we put in place a process where any event that wants to be considered for the WorldTour in 2017 will be assessed during 2016. It will obviously have to be a 2.1 or 1.1, those kinds of level events can be considered and assessed and appraised. There is some limited room around the existing WorldTour events to put in some extra events, provided we don't impose a no-overlap rule, which was causing problems for existing events.

If we don't restrict the number of riders in a team, in the overall team, we leave the teams up to 30 riders, then they can run at least two teams at any one time. We're not talking about new events that those teams are not riding already; we're talking about good quality events that are just outside the WorldTour at the moment, bringing them inside.

In that way, we can start to take the WorldTour more generally around the world.

VN: So is the ASO unduly influencing this debate?

BC: I'm not going to cast aspersions on the ASO. What I will say is that I don't believe that AIOCC had a balanced picture of the reforms when it took that vote. I know that many organizers are quite pleased with the proposals. All I can say is speak to them. See what they have to say. I think you'll find there is quite a lot of support among organizers.

One understands why ASO would be a little bit protective of their assets. They've done a great job with what they have and they don't want to weaken their position. But my view is that the role of the UCI is to work in the interest of all stakeholders, not just one. Our job is to develop and enhance the sport around the world, and I think these proposals will do that.

I don't want to fall out with ASO or anyone else, I want them to keep talking to us and I'm sure that these proposals will enhance everybody's position if we give them a chance to breathe and develop.

VN: Was the three-year license deal, which the ASO has opposed, a victory for the UCI and teams?

I don't like to talk in terms of victory and defeat. What we're trying to do is find balanced solutions that are in everyone's best interest, that strengthen the economic position of our sport. It's a professional sport, so it needs to be based on a strong economy.

The teams now have the possibility of a three-year license; they'll still have to go under annual scrutiny. We'll have sporting appraisal at the end of three years, and with those sporting criteria we'll look at moving teams in or out.

But that's just one of the elements. The teams have only as much stability as the organizers have. They have a commitment for three years; the organizers will have the same. They can predict and plan ahead, and now the teams can do the same. I think that's good for the sport.

If we were in a position where we had 18 WorldTour teams that were sound and another 10 Pro Continental teams that were so well-funded that they were desperate to get into the WorldTour, then we'd look into the assessments, the promotion and relegation possibilities and so on, but we're not there yet. I want us to get there over the fullness of time. To do that we need to allow things to develop incrementally and in a sustainable way.

VN: Anything you want to add?

BC: I think it's fair to say that I'm a little bit puzzled by ASO's position. No objections were raised at the end of our discussion sessions. We gave everybody a lot of opportunity to come back. If we don't have dialogue then we're not going to move forward.

As I said, if you talk to other organizers, if you talk to teams, I think there's pretty strong consensus around these proposals. Maybe they're not dramatic or radical, but I believe they'll work for our sport. Our sport isn't tennis or football or golf, it's not Formula One, it's got to be something that works for our sport, that respects that heritage that we all fell in love with. We need to develop, and spread it around the world if we can, without damaging any of the wonderful features of our sport.",[]
espn.com,,"Sadam Ali, Jessie Vargas fight for welterweight title","['Dan Rafael', 'Pa Sport', 'Brian Campbell', 'Nigel Collins']","Welterweight contenders Sadam Ali and Jessie Vargas, both young, both experienced, and both highly confident, believe they have what it takes to claim a vacant world title when they fight on Saturday night (HBO, 10 ET/PT) at the DC Armory in Washington, D.C.

""I'm coming in with everything I've got, and I'm fully confident that I will come out victorious because of my preparation with my team,"" said Vargas, a former junior welterweight titleholder.

Sadam Ali-Jessie Vargas Where: D.C. Armory in Washington, D.C.

When: Saturday, 10 p.m. ET/PT

TV: HBO

Said Ali, ""This is my chance. This is my shot. He had his. Well, he has another one. That's good for him, but I'm ready. I've been working hard. I'm ready to show everybody why I deserve to be in this position. I'm the humble guy. I don't like to talk. I do the talking in the ring. I'm ready to go out there get that WBO title and show everybody why I deserve to be where I am, and I will do that.""

To most, Ali-Vargas shapes up like a toss-up fight. Neither fighter seems to have any significant advantage over the other as they get ready to battle for the belt recently vacated by Timothy Bradley Jr., who elected to accept a third fight with Manny Pacquiao rather than a much-less lucrative fight with Ali, the mandatory challenger.

""It's a 50/50 fight,"" said Todd duBoef, president of Top Rank, which promotes Vargas. ""Both guys are established and, obviously, Sadam Ali is trying to win his first title. To have both of these guys in the division creating some buzz and putting on great performances will make bigger fights for them.""

Ali (22-0, 13 KOs), 27, of Brooklyn, New York, and Vargas (26-1, 9 KOs), 26, of Las Vegas, will fight in the co-feature of the card headlined by a scheduled 12-round heavyweight bout between Miami-based Cuban defector Luis Ortiz (24-0, 21 KOs), regarded as one of the division's most dangerous punchers, and former two-time world title challenger Tony Thompson (40-6, 27 KOs), who is from Washington.

""I am going to bust up anyone who gets in my way on Saturday night. I am going to make a statement while winning this fight ... We are not looking at this fight going to the scorecards."" Jessie Vargas

Vargas is usually a mild-mannered guy but he has something of a chip on his shoulder going into the fight. He is still steamed about how his last fight ended.

That was in June, when he challenged Bradley for the same 147-pound world title he will face Ali for. He nearly knocked Bradley out in the final seconds of the bout. However, Vargas felt like he was robbed of the chance to finish Bradley because referee Pat Russell mistook the clapper signaling 10-seconds left in the round as the final bell and stopped the fight with about seven seconds left. Vargas lost a clear unanimous decision but was understandably upset over the botched ending.

""I am still burned inside about what happened to me at the end of the Bradley fight,"" Vargas said at Thursday's final news conference. ""I know I cannot change anything about that fight. But my manager Cameron Dunkin and Top Rank have given me a great new opportunity against Sadam Ali. It's for the title belt that Bradley wore. I cannot wait to strap it on me in the ring Saturday night.

""I am going to bust up anyone who gets in my way on Saturday night. I am going to make a statement while winning this fight. I have a new team in my corner starting with my new chief trainer Dewey Cooper, who grew up with me. He has developed a technique which gives me more firepower. We are not looking at this fight going to the scorecards.""

Vargas won a secondary junior welterweight belt against Khabib Allakhverdiev by decision in 2014 and made two defenses, against then-unbeaten Anton Novikov and former lightweight titleholder Antonio DeMarco, before moving up in weight to challenge Bradley.

Unlike before those bouts, Vargas has been very aggressive toward Ali in his pre-fight talk.

""I'm planning on making Sadam Ali quit,"" Vargas said. ""That's my goal and I plan to achieve it. I'm not going to stop pushing from beginning to end. I've conditioned myself. I've prepared myself to come in busy and not leave it up to the judges. Just win a clear, decisive fight.

""He's not on my level and I'm here to show this on fight day. I'm here to prove that he's not on my level. Of course, I'm saying it, but I'm going to prove it that night as well. It's just two different breeds. He doesn't have the experience I have. I've been in there with world-class fighters. I've beaten several undefeated records already, and I'm planning to do the same (Saturday).""

Vargas' assessment of Ali's career is bit off. Ali was a decorated amateur and 2008 U.S. Olympian and although his pro career has not moved a quickly as Vargas', he had a coming out party two fights ago.

""Jessie Vargas is a great fighter, but I am a great fighter and if anybody wants to underestimate me, then that's fine. I'm just ready to go out there and show why I shouldn't be underestimated."" Sadam Ali

In November 2014, Ali knocked out highly regarded contender Luis Carlos Abregu in the ninth round of a major upset. It was a victory that catapulted Ali up the rankings and into the title picture. It was a win even Vargas was impressed by.

""I thought he fought well,"" Vargas said. ""He was a young fighter, and it was an opportunity. Abregu was a top fighter, but he had also been on a long layoff before then and he was an older fighter as well. Like I said before, he's never experienced being in the ring with someone like me -- young, hungry, strong, fast, in his prime. He did surprise me that he did stop Abregu. But credit to him for that.""

Then, in April 2015, Ali boxed in front of his hometown fans at Madison Square Garden in the co-feature of then-heavyweight champion Wladimir Klitschko's defense against Bryant Jennings and put on an impressive performance in a lopsided decision against Francisco Santana. Then it took time to work out the title fight, especially with some uncertainty about whether Bradley would vacate or face Ali. All along, Oscar De La Hoya, CEO of Golden Boy Promotions, which represents Ali, said he believed Ali was ready to fight for a world title.

""Sadam Ali is the perfect combination,"" De La Hoya said. ""I mean, he has the amateur pedigree, which is very, very necessary to become a world-class athlete, and that's exactly what he is. He's a professional fighter who has tremendous speed and amazing footwork and great power. He demonstrated that against Abregu, a fighter who was coming forward, a fighter who has tremendous power, and Sadam Ali took care of business.

""So, look, Sadam Ali is at the perfect moment in his life where this is his year and this is the perfect time to shine. A lot of people, like Sadam said, underestimate his abilities and especially his power.""

Ali believes in himself as well and when told that Vargas said he would make him quit, he blew it off.

""This may piss him off, but it makes me laugh,"" Ali said. ""He's really confident. That's good. That's the way a fighter should be. But make me quit? That is not an option for me.""

Ali said he was a little annoyed by the long layoff, since he has not fought since April. He and Vargas could have met for the interim belt in December, but issues over the site delayed it.

""It was a little frustrating, a little hard to get the fight going and figure out everything,"" Ali said. ""But I've been in the gym. I've been ready. I never took off and stayed out because I didn't have a fight. So I've been ready.

""For some people they might think I haven't proved to be elite. But this is why I'm here. This is why I'm here -- to prove that. Jessie Vargas is a great fighter, but I am a great fighter and if anybody wants to underestimate me, then that's fine. I'm just ready to go out there and show why I shouldn't be underestimated.""",[]

Most riders had fun with the situation and applauded the decision to scrap the stage, though many also wondered why there wasn't a backup plan in place or why the race is held at this early date at all.

A shame with all the technology we have nobody can make a decision be4 the stage as our team knew that there will be snow at the feeding  Andre Greipel (@AndreGreipel) March 9, 2016

The riders are plenty tough enough to handle the snow. Not an issue. Issue is the bikes don't have snow tires for the descents.  Jonathan Vaughters (@Vaughters) March 9, 2016

Anyway, good that they cancelled the stage. I think esp in a stage race that decision is very important for the remainder of the race.  Marcel Kittel (@marcelkittel) March 9, 2016

espn.com,,"Bryan brothers, Andy Murray come up huge in Davis Cup","['Niall Seewang', 'Greg Garber', 'Mark Hodgkinson', 'Nic Atkin', 'Peter Bodo', 'Pa Sport', 'Espn Com', 'Espn Staff']","It comes as no surprise that it was another fantastic Davis Cup weekend.

Our writers weigh in on the highlights with another edition of Racket Response.

@ptbodo: John Isner will quite rightly be remembered as the MVP of Team USA's first-round World Group win over Australia this weekend.

But once again, the pivotal match for the Americans, the match that gave the team breathing room and loosened up Isner's arm (so much so that he was able to shatter the pro serve-speed record with a 157 mph delivery in his tie-clinching win) was Mike and Bob Bryan's critical five-set doubles victory with the tie deadlocked at one match apiece Saturday.

It was a triumph that made them the most successful doubles team in U.S. Davis Cup history at 24-4.

The importance of taking that 2-1 lead in any given tie can't be overstated. These days, with no dominant American star (never mind pair of stars), the U.S. often finds itself deadlocked after the first day of play. And the Bryans invariably deliver.

On Saturday, they withstood a furious comeback in every sense of the word. Aussie icon Lleyton Hewitt came out of his short-lived (five-week) retirement to partner with John Peers (world No. 8 in doubles). Inspired by an adoring home crowd, the Aussies battled back after losing the first two sets to force a fifth set. But the Bryans coolly slammed the door shut, winning the decider 6-3.

@CarlBialik: When the next round of Davis Cup commences, neither the Swiss nor the Spaniards will be around.

Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka skipped Switzerland's opening tie against Italy. It comes as little surprise that the Swiss were routed 5-0. Spain isn't even in the World Group this year. Without these two countries, which host a slew of star-studded players, we're nonetheless going to see some blockbuster matchups moving forward. Defending champion Great Britain will travel to Serbia, a matchup that will headline the competition if the world's top two players, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray, both participate a few weeks before the Olympics in Rio.

But the most intriguing July matchup might be France's visit to the Czech Republic. The Czechs won the competition in 2012 and 2013 but needed fifth-rubber heroics from Lukas Rosol to beat Germany on Sunday. France, meanwhile, is so deep that after it swept its first three matches against Canada, captain Yannick Noah sent out his No. 3 and No. 4 players -- Richard Gasquet and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who played behind Gael Monfils and Gilles Simon -- for the dead rubbers.

France has reached three finals since its last Davis Cup win in 2001. If its best players continue showing such deep commitment to the competition that France's Four Musketeers dominated 85 years ago, the French team should have a good chance to end its title drought.

@MCThomasSport: It was a good weekend to be a British tennis fan. The country's men won their first match as Davis Cup champions, while Heather Watson secured her third WTA title.

Watson's victory in Monterrey put her on the brink of a return to the world's top 50. The 23-year-old joined Johanna Konta and Naomi Broady in climbing the rankings.

But it was in Birmingham where the bigger news took place. Andy Murray once again dug deep, pushing Great Britain past Japan. His powers of recovery helped him stave off a Kei Nishikori fight-back in the decisive rubber. Afterward, British captain Leon Smith called Murray a ""man of steel.""

It was difficult to disagree with that assessment in the aftermath of a thrilling win. However, with Serbia coming in July, Murray will need to be at his superhuman best if Britain is to prevail once more -- and not only because of the presence of the Scot's biggest nemesis, Novak Djokovic.

That quarterfinal tie is scheduled to be played just five days after the final of Wimbledon, where both players are expected to go deep. There will be no opportunity for immediate rest following the encounter, either, with Olympic battles commencing Aug. 6.

All of which means the star names could be battling physical fatigue as much as each other in Belgrade. Murray insists he will take part in the clash, but exhaustion could dictate his eventual inclusion in the tie.

@ESPNtenis: After the retirement of David Nalbandian, and with Juan Martin del Potro injured, Leonardo Mayer has become the new leader of the Argentina Davis Cup team, a role he probably never asked for.

Always a low-profile player, Mayer has always been a great leader by example. The first time he was in such a position was in a 2014 rubber against Israel that would decide relegation from the World Group, a position Argentina hardly finds itself in.

Mayer stood his ground, winning both his singles matches, a crucial sequence for Argentina to scrape through with a 3-2 series victory. Mayer never looked back.

This past weekend he won both his singles matches against Poland. Make that 11 wins in a row for Mayer, tying Nalbandian for the most in team history. And what makes the feat more important is that 10 out of those 11 victories came when the result of the rubber was still undecided.

The 3-2 series victory against Poland also means that Argentina will play Italy in July's quarterfinals. Mayer should have a chance to set a new record.",[]
espn.com,,Antonio Margarito lucio mohoso en su regreso al cuadrilatero,"['Escritor Senior De Espn Com', 'Carlos Narv Ez Rosario Especial Para Espn Digital', 'Bernardo Pilatti', 'Espn Digital', 'Salvador Rodr Guez Espn Digital', 'Dan Rafael']","Un resumen de las mejores peleas de la semana pasada en todo el mundo:

Sabado en Washington, D.C.

Luis Ortiz KO6 Tony Thompson

Peso Pesado

Records: Ortiz (25-0, 22 KO); Thompson (40-7, 27 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Desde el momento que Ortiz noqueo al contendiente Bryant Jennings de forma devastadora en el septimo round el 19 de diciembre, inmediatamente se convirtio en el cuco la division de peso pesado, un hombre con el que ninguno de los lideres de la division queria enredarse. Fue un excelente amateur en el famoso equipo nacional cubano y es un zurdo rapido con una potencia aplastante que no gana demasiado dinero. Por todas estas razones, lograr que un pugilista de renombre suba al ring con el es y sera una pesadilla para Golden Boy Promotions.

Golden Boy paso por varios oponentes que rechazaron la oportunidad de encabezar esta cartelera de HBO. Alexander Dimitrenko acepto, pero luego intento sacar mas dinero, y al no estar disponible, mas tarde se retiro. Asi fue que con aproximadamente un mes de antelacion, Thompson, de 44 anos, ex retador de titulo mundial en dos ocasiones (dos veces noqueado por Wladimir Klitschko), acepto la pelea. Thompson rara vez ha rechazado una oportunidad y acepto rapidamente este combate con la ventaja de que ya estaba programado para su ciudad de Washington, D.C., donde nunca habia peleado en 17 anos como profesional.

Thompson entrego su mejor esfuerzo pero no estaba en las mejores condiciones, estuvo muy lento y fue presa facil para el demoledor puno izquierdo de Ortiz. El cubano, de 6-4 pies y 242 libras, cuyo titulo mundial interino no estuvo en juego porque la organizacion comprensiblemente se nego a aceptar a Thompson como retador, anoto tres derribos en el combate entre los zurdos.

Ortiz, quien deserto y ahora esta basado en Miami, casi logra terminar la pelea en el primer asalto, cuando bajo duramente a Thompson con un volado de izquierda a la cabeza. Thompson, de 6-5 pies y 264 libras, no queria sentirse avergonzado delante de su publico y mostro gran corazon al seguir adelante. Pero tenia poco que ofrecer y cayo por segunda vez tras un volado de izquierda identico hacia el final del tercer segmento.

En el sexto round, ""El Verdadero King Kong"", volvio a aterrizar otro potente volado de izquierda y Thompson fue derribado nuevamente. Esta vez estaba hecho, y el arbitro Malik Waleed completo la cuenta a los 2 minutos, 29 segundos, mientras Thompson intentaba levantarse. Fue otra actuacion devastadora de Ortiz, que no hara nada para convencer a otros oponentes de primera de enfrentarlo.

En total, Ortiz aterrizo 88 de 250 golpes (35 por ciento), mientras que Thompson conecto 43 de 221 golpes (19 por ciento), segun las estadisticas de golpes de CompuBox.

Como correspondia, dos jueces dieron a Ortiz como ganador de cada asalto, pero el tercero, Lloyd Scaife de Washington, entrego una tarjeta localista vergonzosa en la que tuvo la audacia de darle a Thompson dos asaltos en una pelea que fue pura dominacion de Ortiz de principio a fin.

Golden Boy espera que Ortiz regrese el 7 de mayo para pelear en la cartelera de Canelo Alvarez-Amir Khan por HBO PPV ante el retador obligatorio ruso Alexander Ustinov (33-1, 24 KO). La pelea deberia llevarse a cabo antes del 19 de junio.

Jessie Vargas KOT 9 Sadam Ali

Gana un titulo pesos welter vacante

Records: Vargas (27-1, 10 KO); Ali (22-1, 13 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: En lo que quizas haya sido la mejor actuacion de su carrera, Vargas, de 26 anos, ex campeon de peso welter junior de Las Vegas, anoto una victoria contundente para llevarse su segundo titulo mundial. El y Ali, pugilista olimpico 2008 de Brooklyn, Nueva York, de 27 anos, se enfrentaron por el titulo mundial de las 147 libras recientemente desocupado por Timothy Bradley Jr., quien opto por aceptar un lucrativo tercer encuentro con Manny Pacquiao el 9 de abril en lugar de enfrentarse a Ali, su retador obligatorio.

En la previa, esta pelea fue universalmente considerada como un duelo parejo que podria resultar entretenido, y eso es exactamente lo que fue. Resulto competitiva y entretenida, ya que ambos luchadores tuvieron sus momentos en un combate trepidante.

Sin embargo, al final fue Vargas, quien aterrizo mas golpes, fue mas preciso y tuvo una respuesta cada vez que Ali lograba conectar, quien se impuso en la ocasion. Ali predijo antes de la pelea que haria renunciar a Vargas, pero Ali no sabe que eso no esta en la naturaleza de Vargas. Se mostro muy disciplinado y dio credito por la victoria al plan de juego y la motivacion que le dio Dewey Cooper, su nuevo entrenador.

Vargas llego a la pelea molesto por como habia terminado su ultimo combate en junio, una derrota por decision unanime cuando desafio a Bradley por el cinturon. Estuvo a punto de detener a Bradley en los ultimos segundos del combate, pero sintio que le robaron la oportunidad de acabar con el cuando el arbitro Pat Russell confundio la senal de los 10 segundos como la campana final y detuvo la pelea cuando aun quedaban unos siete segundos en el reloj. Vargas prometio que no demoraria en ponerse en marcha nuevamente y cumplio su promesa contra Ali, a quien derribo dos veces.

El ojo derecho de Ali comenzo a hincharse en un cuarto asalto a pura accion. Ali estaba disfrutando de un octavo round muy bueno hasta que Vargas le conecto un volado de derecha limpio que le doblo cerca de las cuerdas cuando el segmento estaba llegando a su fin. Vargas siguio atacando en el noveno asalto, y lo derribo con un golpe de derecha hacia la mitad del round antes de terminarlo con otro golpe de derecha, cuando el arbitro Kenny Chevalier intervino para detener el combate a los 2 minutos y 9 segundos.

Segun las estadisticas de CompuBox, Vargas aterrizo 159 de 429 golpes (37 por ciento) y Ali conecto 118 de 408 golpes (29 por ciento). Pero Vargas, arriba en las tres tarjetas de cara al noveno asalto, cerro el espectaculo en dicho round al aterrizar 21 de 35 golpes de poder.

Con la victoria en la mano y el cinturon puesto, Vargas pidio la revancha con Bradley, independientemente del resultado de su tercer encuentro con Pacquiao. Top Rank dijo que le gustaria enfrentar a Vargas con el ganador del 9 de abril. Pase lo que pase, con esta actuacion tan solida y entretenida, Vargas se ha posicionado muy bien en la industria.

Oscar Escandon KO7 Robinson Castellanos

Gana un titulo interino vacante de peso pluma

Records: Escandon (25-2, 17 KO); Castellanos (21-11, 13 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: En noviembre, el campeon Gary Russell Jr. tenia programado enfrentar a Escandon en una defensa voluntaria antes de medirse con su retador obligatorio, Castellanos. Pero Russell sufrio un corte durante el entrenamiento y la pelea con Escandon fue cancelada. Con Russell fuera, Castellanos y Escandon fueron aprobados para enfrentarse por el titulo interino, con Russell obligado a medirse con el ganador a finales de este ano.

Castellanos, mexicano de 33 anos, habia logrado dos triunfos inesperados en la fila -- un nocaut en el quinto asalto sobre el entonces invicto Ronny Rios en octubre de 2014, y por luego decision unanime ante Rocky Juarez en enero de 2015 -- para convertirse en retador obligatorio de Russell. Sin embargo, Castellanos no logro llevar a tres su racha victoriosa ya que un Escandon mucho mas petiso, de 31 anos, pugilista olimpico para Colombia en 2004, subio de categoria para aplicar una presion implacable, y castigarlo con golpes al cuerpo hasta vencerlo.

El mejor momento de Castellanos llego en el segundo round, cuando derribo a Escandon con una combinacion de jab-derecha que lo dejo sentado. Escandon, sin embargo, no parecia estar lastimado y se levanto rapidamente.

Fue quebrando a Castellanos de manera constante, lo metio en problemas en el quinto asalto (durante el cual Castellanos sufrio un feo corte sobre el ojo izquierdo) y luego lo derribo con un gancho limpio de derecha en el septimo. Castellanos apoyo una rodilla y el arbitro Frank Garza completo la cuenta a los 2 minutos, 59 segundos. Fue una gran victoria para Escandon, quien aun no conoce a su nueva bebe, que nacio hace tres semanas mientras el se encontraba en el campo de entrenamiento.

S[abado en Bethlehem, Pa.

Julian ""J Rock"" Williams KOT 7 Marcello Matano

Peso junior mediano - eliminatoria de titulo

Records: Williams (23-0-1, 14 KO); Matano (16-2, 15 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Williams, pugilista de 25 anos de Filadelfia, probablemente tenga razon cuando dice ningun pugil de primera en las 154 libras querra luchar contra el a menos que tenga que hacerlo. Ahora, uno lo hara. Williams vencio y castigo a Matano --quien nunca deberia haber estado cerca de una eliminatoria por un titulo mundial dada su oposicion abrumadoramente suave-- en un combate desparejo que encabezo una cartelera triple de Showtime para convertirse en el retador obligatorio del campeon Jermall Charlo (23- 0, 18 KOs). Esta pelea deberia resultar muy facil de organizar ya que ambos trabajan con el manager Al Haymon.

Matano, italiano de 29 anos, quien peleaba fuera de su pais de origen por primera vez, se despidio de una racha ganadora de cuatro peleas de forma violenta. Se mostro fuerte, pero Williams se tomo su tiempo para quebrarlo, sobre todo con un buen ataque al cuerpo.

Williams tenia todo el control cuando lastimo a Matano con un gancho de izquierda y un golpe de derecha en el septimo round. Williams luego castigo a un Matano indefenso por todo el ring con una serie de golpes fuertes hasta que el arbitro Gary Rosato detuvo la pelea a los 2 minutos, 24 segundos. Despues del combate, Williams alego que merece una pelea importante y llamo a Charlo.

""Tal vez la gente piensa que vio una grieta en la armadura esta noche"", dijo Williams. ""Tal vez los muchachos saldran de sus escondites y veran el trabajo de este tipo de West Philly. Jermall ha estado observando mis actuaciones. El y su hermano (gemelo) (Jermell) saben exactamente quien soy. El debe pelear o abandonar ahora. Debe dar un paso al frente, pero ya esta poniendo excusas. Que de un paso al frente y pelee contra mi. Somos dos de los mejores medianos junior del mundo. Se trata de grandeza. Yo quiero ser grande. Todos ustedes, pavos de las 154 libras, peleemos"".

Avtandil Khurtsidze KOT 10 Antoine Douglas

Peso mediano

Records: Khurtsidze (32-2-2, 21 KO); Douglas (19-1-1, 13 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Douglas, prospero contendiente de 23 anos de Burke, Virginia, supuestamente debia enfrentarse al ex campeon Sam Soliman (44-13, 18 KO), de 44 anos, cuyos mejores dias estan en el pasado. Pero Soliman sufrio una lesion en la rodilla y se echo atras, por lo que Khurtsidze, un oponente superior, acepto la pelea con menos de tres semanas de antelacion. Resulto ser una muy mala decision del equipo de Douglas haberlo aceptado como oponente. Khurtsidze, pugilista de 36 anos de Georgia (la antigua Republica Sovietica) basado en Brooklyn, Nueva York, extendio su racha ganadora a nueve peleas seguidas con una gran actuacion en la que le propino semejante paliza a Douglas, que su carrera podria haberse alterado para siempre.

Khurtsidze, de 5-4 pies, quien no ha perdido por decision desde que se enfrento a Hassan N'Dam en una pelea por un titulo mundial interino en 2010, avanzo desde el principio y castigo a Douglas, quien no tuvo ayuda de sus esquineros, quienes deberian avergonzarse de no haber protegido a su peleador deteniendo la pelea antes.

Khurtsidze derribo a Douglas por primera vez en su carrera con un golpe de izquierda al principio del tercer asalto, para hacerlo caer de bruces a traves de las cuerdas. Douglas se recupero para ganar los rounds cuatro y cinco de una pelea muy entretenida, antes de que Khurtsidze abriera el septimo asalto con un enorme golpe de izquierda que volvio a bajar a Douglas. Un Douglas machacado recibio un enorme castigo durante el 10 segmento, ya que Khurtsidze no freno su embestida hasta que el arbitro Benjy Esteves finalmente detuvo la pelea a los 33 segundos, con un Douglas indefenso contra las cuerdas.

""Yo sabia que se iba a cansar"", dijo Khurtsidze. ""Sentia que iba a agarrarlo. Es un buen boxeador, pero no es fuerte. Yo sabia que el iba a estar hambriento. Pero tambien sabia que iba a vencerlo. Hubo poca antelacion, pero hice todo lo que pude en el tiempo que tuvimos. Me quede en el gimnasio y me mantuve afilado. Estoy listo para quien sea que me pongan delante. Me encanta pelear. Pelearia contra cualquiera"".

Douglas, quien paso la noche en el hospital, en observacion, dijo: ""Me siento bien. El definitivamente domino. Definitivamente tuvo un mejor dia hoy. No es desalentador, simplemente no pudimos ejecutar. Naturalmente, estoy decepcionado. Es volver a empezar"".

Tony Harrison KOT 6 Fernando Guerrero

Peso mediano

Records: Harrison (23-1, 19 KO); Guerrero (28-4, 20 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Harrison, pugil de 25 anos de Detroit, era considerado por muchos como un prospecto imperdible hasta que se topo con Willie Nelson el pasado mes de julio y sufrio una inesperada derrota por nocaut en el noveno asalto. Harrison se recupero en octubre con una decision unilateral sobre Cecil McCalla y continuo con esta dominante victoria por nocaut contra Guerrero, zurdo de 29 anos de Salisbury, Maryland.

El primer round fue una muestra de lo que sucederia en el resto del combate, ya que Harrison aterrizo 10 de 38 golpes, segun las estadisticas de CompuBox, mientras que Guerrero increiblemente no logro colocar ninguno de sus 11 disparos. Las cosas no mejoraron mucho para el. Harrison lo castigo en el segundo round con una serie de golpes pesados antes de hacerlo caer de bruces con un golpe de derecha justo antes de que sonara la campana. Guerrero tuvo un par de momentos dignos en los asaltos cuatro y cinco, pero Harrison nunca estuvo en problemas, y luego mando a guardar a Guerrero en el sexto con dos caidas mas. Un golpe de izquierda dejo sentado a Guerrero en una esquina, y cuando se reanudo la pelea estaba tan inestable que se tambaleo cerca de otra esquina al otro lado del cuadrilatero antes de que Harrison le conectara un golpe de derecha. Guerrero volvio a caer en esa esquina y el arbitro Gary Rosato detuvo la pelea a 1 minuto, 54 segundos.

En total, Harrison aterrizo 100 de 314 golpes (35 por ciento) y Guerrero conecto apenas 51 de 188 (27 por ciento). Guerrero, quien fue noqueado por el entonces campeon de peso mediano Peter Quillin en el septimo asalto de una pelea titular en 2013, cayo a 3-3 en sus ultimos seis combates, incluyendo dicha derrota. Todas sus derrotas han sido por nocaut y ya no parece tener mas donde ir a esta altura. Harrison parece estar encaminado nuevamente despues de su derrota, y dijo que quiere una revancha con Nelson.

En la misma cartelera, el prospecto de peso mediano Ievgen Khytrov (13-0, 11 KOs), de 27 anos, pugilista olimpico en 2012 para Ucrania basado en Brooklyn, Nueva York, gano una decision unanime contra Kenneth McNeil (9-2, 6 KOs), pugil de 25 anos de Birmingham, Alabama, con tarjetas de 99-90, 97-92 y 97-92.

Sabado en Grozny, Rusia

Lucas Browne KOT 10 Ruslan Chagaev

Gana un titulo peso pesado

Records: Browne (24-0, 21 KO); Chagaev (34-3-1, 21 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Cuando Tyson Fury inesperadamente supero a Wladimir Klitschko en noviembre, se convirtio en el legitimo campeon de peso pesado. Punto. Sin embargo, la AMB tiene esta mala costumbre --que dice estar tratando de cortar-- de tener a tres campeones en la misma categoria de peso: un ""super"", un ""regular"" y un interino. Chagaev ha sido el supuesto titular ""regular"" secundario desde 2014 y disputo su segunda defensa ante el retador obligatorio Browne.

Browne, de 36 anos, mostro un enorme corazon al remontar la pelea para lograr la victoria mas importante de su carrera y convertirse en el primer australiano en ganar un titulo de peso pesado. La pelea fue un poco desordenada, pero Chagaev, zurdo de 37 anos de Uzbekistan, derribo fuertemente a Browne con una recta de izquierda cuando quedaban unos 35 segundos en el sexto asalto. Sangrando del ojo izquierdo y con las piernas temblorosas, Browne volvio a ser atacado por Chagaev con otro golpe de izquierda que lo hizo rebotar contra las cuerdas momentos mas tarde. Browne estaba en muy malas condiciones al finalizar el asalto y tuvo suerte de llegar a la campana. Sin embargo, logro recuperarse y de hecho tuvo un septimo round bastante bueno.

En el 10 asalto, Browne, con cortes sobre el ojo izquierdo y en la frente, conecto un fuerte golpe de derecha en el menton de Chagaev, que lo hizo retroceder a los tumbos con un minuto por delante. Chagaev le entro directo al golpe, que nunca vio venir, y quedo muy lastimado. Logro superar la cuenta, pero no se encontraba bien. Browne entonces fue por el y comenzo a aterrizar a voluntad. Le coloco unos 18 golpes sin respuesta --en su mayoria de derecha-- mientras Chagaev se tambaleaba contra las cuerdas, hasta que el arbitro Stanley Christodoulou finalmente detuvo el combate a los 2 minutos, 27 segundos. Deberia haber intervenido unos cuantos golpes antes.

Con su inesperado triunfo, Browne ahora tendra que enfrentarse a Fres Oquendo para junio en una de las peleas que forman parte de un torneo de la AMB disenado para reducir gradualmente a sus titulares, y quedarse con uno solo.

""Estoy muy orgulloso de haber ganado este titulo para Australia"", dijo Browne. ""Obviamente puedo mejorar, pero demostre que mi corazon y mi potencia no pueden cuestionarse. Estoy encantado de haber hecho historia. Fue un gran paso adelante, pero logre la victoria y agradezco a todos por el apoyo. No hay palabras para describir como me siento en este momento"".

Sabado en Ciudad Mexico

Antonio Margarito G10 Jorge Paez Jr.

Peso Junior Mediano

Tarjetas: 97-93, 96-93, 95-94

Records: Margarito (39-8, 27 KO); Paez Jr. (39-8-2, 23 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Mas de cuatro anos despues de que al ex campeon mundial de peso welter le hicieran hamburguesa su ojo operado durante una derrota por nocaut en 10 asaltos ante el entonces campeon de peso mediano junior Miguel Cotto en su hostil revancha de diciembre de 2011 para luego retirarse, Margarito regreso al ring.

El mexicano, quien cumplira 38 anos la proxima semana, se vio muy oxidado y lento contra Paez, mexicano de 28 anos, quien acababa de subir de categoria de peso y perdio su segunda pelea consecutiva y por tercera vez en sus ultimos cuatro combates. A pesar de sus limitaciones, Paez le dio muchos problemas a Margarito en esta pelea de alto contacto. El ojo derecho de Margarito todavia se ve horrible y deforme, parecia mas lento que durante su mejor momento, y no parecia tener mucha potencia en sus golpes. No obstante, permanecio en el centro del ring e intercambio con Paez durante la mayor parte del combate.

El publico de alrededor de 10.000 personas estaba encantado con la accion y se hizo oir en el sexto asalto, cuando Paez conecto un par de fuertes golpes de derecha y un gancho de izquierda para derribar con fuerza a Margarito. Margarito mostro resistencia al vencer el conteo. Paez intento acabar con el, pero Margarito resistio y lucho por recuperarse en algunos de los intercambios mas intensos de la pelea. Margarito se recupero bien de la caida y termino la pelea con fuerza. De hecho, casi logra detener a Paez en el asalto final.

Margarito, aun visto como un paria por muchos por intentar pelear contra Shane Mosley en un combate por el titulo welter en 2009 con los guantes cargados en Paris (por lo cual perdio su licencia), logro vencer a Paez. Pero cual es el punto de continuar su carrera? Paez es un viajante y casi logra noquearlo. Un buen oponente probablemente destruiria a Margarito, cuyo ojo fue gravemente herido en una amplia derrota ante Manny Pacquiao en 2011, despues de lo cual tuvo que ser operado. Es muy poco probable que Margarito consiga una pelea importante.

Giovanni Delgado G10 Cesar Juarez

Peso pluma

Tarjetas: 96-95, 96-93 Delgado, 95-94 Juarez

Records: Delgado (16-4, 9 KO); Juarez (17-5, 13 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Delgado, mexicano de 24 anos, el tercer oponente en unos 10 dias, tomo la pelea con un par de dias de antelacion y logro un inesperado triunfo. Llego al combate despues de haber perdido dos en fila y tres de sus ultimas cuatro peleas. Juarez, mexicano de 24 anos, venia de una derrota por decision en una pelea sensacional con Nonito Donaire por un titulo mundial vacante de peso pluma junior el 11 de diciembre. Quizas volvio a la accion demasiado rapido despues de esta brutal pelea. Fuera lo que fuese, no tuvo el mismo espiritu que mostro en la pelea por el titulo y Delgado arranco este solido combate con todo. Delgado se mantuvo ocupado en todos los asaltos e hizo lo suficiente para ganar una decision pareja

Viernes en Tampa

Orlando Cruz G10 Romulo Koasicha

Peso junior ligero

Tarjetas: 100-87, 99-88 (dos veces)

Records: Cruz (23-4-1, 11 KO); Koasicha (25-6, 15 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Cruz, puertorriqueno de 34 anos, quien se hizo famoso al convertirse en el primer boxeador abiertamente homosexual, gano su tercer combate consecutivo luego de perder dos seguidos, incluyendo el nocaut en el septimo asalto ante Orlando Salido por un titulo mundial vacante de peso pluma en octubre de 2013. Cruz domino a Koasicha en el evento principal televisado por Telemundo, y anoto tres derribos camino a la victoria.

Cruz derribo a Koasicha dos veces en el sexto round, primero con un golpe de izquierda que dejo a Koasicha con la nariz ensangrentada, y luego con una combinacion. En el 10, Cruz volvio a derribarlo bajo una fuerte presion. El combate fue lo mas desparejo que podria darse, exceptuando el nocaut.

Koasicha, mexicano de 24 anos, perdio su segunda pelea consecutiva luego de haber sido noqueado en el 10 asalto en noviembre, cuando desafio al campeon mundial de peso pluma Vasyl Lomachenko.

Viernes en Kyoto, Japon

Shinsuke Yamanaka G12 Liborio Solis

Retiene un titulo peso gallo

Tarjetas: 117-107 (tres veces)

Records: Yamanaka (25-0-2, 17 KO); Solis (23-4-1, 10 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Yamanaka, japones zurdo de 33 anos, sobrevivio dos caidas en el tercer asalto, pero tambien derribo al ex campeon de peso gallo junior Solis, venezolano de 33 anos, dos veces camino a la victoria. Yamanaka, quien defendio su titulo por 10a vez, anoto sus derribos en el segundo round (con un gancho de derecha) y el noveno (golpe de izquierda). La mano derecha de Solis hizo a Yamanaka tocar la lona dos veces en el tercer segmento. Yamanaka logro volver a la pelea, y como se utilizo el sistema de puntaje abierto, sabia que estaba 77-72 arriba en las tres tarjetas despues del octavo round.

Ganigan Lopez G12 Yu Kimura

Gana un titulo peso junior mosca

Tarjetas: 119-109, 118-110, 114-114

Records: Lopez (27-6, 17 KO); Kimura (18-3-1, 3 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Lopez, mexicano zurdo de 34 anos, no supo aprovechar su primera oportunidad de pelear por un titulo mundial cuando el entonces campeon del peso mosca junior Pedro Guevara lo supero por puntos en julio. Dos peleas mas tarde, Lopez consiguio otra oportunidad y logro un triunfo inesperado sobre Kimura, japones de 32 anos, quien defendia su titulo por primera vez despues luego de haber tomado el cinturon de Guevara por decision dividida en noviembre. Fue una pelea relativamente aburrida ya que ninguno de los pugilistas mostro demasiado en ataque, aunque Lopez, un poco mas preciso, hizo su trabajo de forma bastante dominante.

The Los Angeles Rams had an opportunity to draft Robert Griffin III in 2012, but decided to exchange their second overall selection for a large cache of picks from the Washington Redskins.

Editor's Picks Landing spots for Robert Griffin III Now that the Redskins have released Robert Griffin III, Mike Sando takes stock of which teams around the NFL could be interested in the QB's services.

RG III's rookie season provided lasting memories for Redskins fans From the opening game, it was clear quarterback Robert Griffin III would make an impact for the Washington Redskins as a rookie. 1 Related

The Rams now have a chance to redo that move by acquiring Griffin via free agency. Griffin's track record in Washington had more than its share of down moments, but those valleys have greatly overshadowed his talents.

Those skills are a perfect fit for what Los Angeles needs on offense, so much so that if the Rams are able to sign Griffin, the move should propel them to a playoff berth next season.",[]

Holm and McGregor were heavy favorites at UFC 196. Both of them booked post-fight parties at the same place. Both of them lost in upsets by rear-naked choke submission. The name of the club: Surrender.

espn.com,,Toronto Maple Leafs' Brooks Laich doesn't want your pity,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Dan Marrazza', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Sean Allen', 'John Buccigross', 'Sarah Goldstein', 'Scott Burnside', 'John Rosengren', 'Paul Grant']","TORONTO -- One would think dropping 30 places in the standings would sink a man's spirits about as low they can get.

Not to mention missing out on what appears to be the Washington Capitals' most realistic chance at a Stanley Cup in the Alex Ovechkin era.

But cancel your pity parties for poor ol' Brooks Laich.

The 32-year-old native of Wawota, Saskatchewan, sounded like a man re-born, re-energized, absolutely stoked about the opportunity at hand with the last-place Toronto Maple Leafs.

Editor's Picks Laich: 'empty feeling' not getting Cup with Caps After trying to talk the Capitals out of a trade, Brooks Laich said he has an ""empty feeling"" about not winning the Cup with his team of 12 years.

Power Rankings: Race to the top heating up While the top team in the rankings remains the same, three hard-charging challengers are in the midst of impressive hot streaks that have shaken things up down below.

Trade deadline sparks emotions even with fewer moves Despite many of the big names staying put at the trade deadline, there was still enough action to get you cheering and jeering at your general manager. 2 Related

For starters, he was reminded while standing for ""O Canada"" before a game at Air Canada Centre of dreaming as a kid of wearing a Leafs sweater one day.

""I had obviously been in the building many times before but always as the opposition,"" Laich said Monday. ""This time playing for the home team, I mean, I used to watch Hockey Night In Canada every Saturday like every kid in Canada. I wanted to play for the Leafs. I was a (Doug) Gilmour fan, a (Mats) Sundin fan. When we had the anthem and the Canadian flag was going down the one side in the crowd, the Maple Leafs flag was going down the other, and I was playing for the Leafs, people were rooting for me, that's when it really hit home. This was a dream come true. It really is. It's something very special.

""A lot of people might look at the situation that got me here and say, 'Oh he's disappointed, he must be upset.' No, I look at it like a tremendous opportunity, I'm very fortunate to be here.""

Fortunate ... to be with the last-place Leafs? He is not kidding.

Because he sees this chance in Toronto as a chance to kickstart his career.

The reality -- and Laich probably knows it -- is that the Leafs' true interest in the Feb. 28 trade with the Capitals was acquiring the 2016 second-round pick and young blueliner Connor Carrick. They don't get that good a pick unless they take on Laich's contract, which carries a $4.5-million salary cap hit this season and next.

Still, Leafs management has an open mind as far as Laich's future. After all, with the departures of Dion Phaneuf and Roman Polak, there's need for veteran leadership around this ever-younger Leafs roster.

But Laich will only have a future with the Leafs if his play on the ice warrants it. And he knows that.

""As of right now, the plan is day by day for myself. I'm trying to prove myself,"" Laich said.

""My job first and foremost is to rebuild my career, play the way I can. Be an effective, everyday consistent player. And then when doing so, the other intangibles come naturally. I love teammates, I love the team atmosphere of hockey, I love the enthusiasm of young kids, I remember being there 10 years ago, being one myself. But all those things come after me first playing well. I have to play well in order to have my voice carry any weight in the locker room.""

Brooks Laich already got his first taste of playing against the Capitals. Patrick McDermott/NHLI/Getty Images

As for the Caps, who he's already faced since the trade, those emotions are still tangled.

""I really don't know, I was talking with my fiancee the other night, I haven't gone through the anger stage,"" said Laich, who was the longest-serving Capitals player before being dealt. ""I still look at it like I was fortunate to be there for 12 years. There's no guarantee they're going to win a Stanley Cup. People are saying, 'You got robbed of a Cup ring.' Well, hold on, they haven't won it yet. We don't know what's going to happen. For myself, I've always loved playing the game, I'm playing in the National Hockey League, which is a privilege. This is a new lease on my career here, a chance to rebuild my career, I had such a diminished role in Washington; it didn't look like there was a future there. Here I've got a chance to play and re-establish myself and further my career. That's something I'm really excited about.""

He admits to have watched a Caps game on TV since he got to Toronto. Pretty hard not to.

""I'll watch them, certainly. I'll be curious and a little bit anxious to see what happens there. So many good friends there, I will always wish good friends well,"" Laich said.

But, to suggest he'll be wearing Caps pom-poms come spring time? I'm not so sure about that.

""To be completely honest, it really is a unique situation,"" Laich said. ""I really wish my friends well, at the same time, it would be really hard to see. ... I really don't know how I'll feel if everything goes their way. I'll be happy for my friends, like Ovi (Alex Ovechkin) and Nicky (Nicklas Backstrom) and Chimmer (Jason Chimera), I'll be happy for a lot of those guys. But as far as the feelings towards the situation and whatever, and how or when I was moved out, the timing of it all? I'm not sure how that's going to play out yet.""",[]

On the men's side, Tinkoff sprinter Peter Sagan will return to defend his 2015 title, along with fellow podium finishers Julian Alaphilippe (Etixx-Quick Step) and Mark Cavendish (Team Dimension Data-Qhubeka), who won four stages at last year's Tour of California.

""Last season was an incredible one for me,"" said Sagan, who also won the world road championships last fall. ""The Amgen Tour of California is one of my favorite races of the season; I've done well and had the honor of wearing yellow, and it's important to me to build upon where I left off last year.""

Rohan Dennis (BMC Racing Team) will be a favorite at the Folsom Time Trial, thanks in part to his record average time-trial speed (55.4 kilometers per hour) during Stage 1 of last year's Tour de France. Team Katusha, currently ranked second in the world, will bring top sprinter Alexander Kristoff to California, after Kristoff had several head-to-head battles with Cavendish at the Tour of Oman earlier this year.

Other notable names in the field include California-based Peter Stetina (Trek-Segafredo) and 2012 Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins, who will be at the Tour of California with his namesake team as part of preparation for the Rio Olympics.

espn.com,,Future of WGC-Cadillac Championship event at Doral tenuous,"['Bob Harig', 'Jason Sobel']","DORAL, Fla. -- Ask those of a certain age what this area was like when the Doral Golf Resort opened in 1962 and you get some variation on the word ""nothing.''

In the 1960s, the part of greater Miami where Trump National Doral sits might as well have been in the Gulf of Mexico. It was so far west of the city that it was considered ""remote.''

Now, it's an incorporated city, with a population of 50,000 plus, myriad businesses and the corresponding traffic nightmares.

And it is in danger of losing its long-time golf tournament, one that is now in its 54th year on the PGA Tour, the second-longest-running tournament behind the event at Colonial Country Club.

This week's WGC-Cadillac Championship could be the last playing of the tournament here, and it is not solely because of owner Donald Trump and the political ramifications of his comments on the campaign trail regarding Mexicans and Muslims.

It goes beyond that. Cadillac is in its last year of title sponsorship, which is unlikely to renew, and it's not easy to find sponsors that are required to pony up well north of $10 million for one golf event.

And that does not even address another big issue that plagues the event: It might attract the top players in the world, but it is not the same experience -- at least anecdotally -- as it was prior to becoming a World Golf Championship event.

""The tournament has lost its luster,'' said Erik Compton, a PGA Tour player who lives in Miami. ""The community just doesn't seem as involved.''

Compton, 36, has never played his hometown event since it became a WGC in 2007. He received sponsor exemptions to the tournament years ago when it was a regular, full-field event.

Last year, he decided to attend as a spectator with his daughter, Petra, and was surprised to see almost no one in the grandstands behind the 18th green.

""I don't think anything says it better than this,'' Compton said. ""It was a corporate tent, but there was nobody in the tents and somebody asked us to leave. We got kicked out. She had an ice cream in her hand, and I told them I was a tour player, showed them my badge, and they still made us leave. If the tournament directors knew that, I'm sure they would be upset.

""But the community is really not part of it. It was one of the premier events on the PGA Tour and then it went totally corporate.''

That is partly by design. A WGC event with a $9.5 million purse requires more corporate support than a regular PGA Tour event. That is difficult to avoid.

But the old Doral had a flare that is missing today with its smaller field, no cut and late tee times on Thursday and Friday.

When it was a regular PGA Tour event, Doral was seemingly a must-play event on the way to the Masters. It kicked off the Florida Swing for many years in early March and typically drew many of the game's top players. If was often the launching point for Greg Norman (he won it three times) and even Jack Nicklaus, who first started playing the tournament in 1964 and competed there well into his 50s.

There was a nice vibe to the place, the first signs of true warmth anywhere in the country in the new year, with the Masters a few weeks down the road.

That changed when the event became a WGC, not because the field wasn't as good -- it was better, in theory, with all of the top-ranked players -- but because a lot of the local flavor was lost when the big corporations took over, seeking a return on their big investments and using it as a place to wine and dine. Ticket prices went up, and if you showed up at mid-morning on Friday, nobody was playing golf.

It is a bit of an issue at the WGC-Bridgestone in Akron, Ohio, as well. The event is well attended in a community that has had a golf tournament for years, but no-cut events with big-money guarantees remove some of the urgency. Despite the cash, players do not treat these events like major championships. There is no Wednesday pro-am, and little buzz until the weekend.

Erik Compton remembers when the PGA Tour stop at Doral captivated the community. ""The tournament has lost its luster,"" he said. David Cannon/Getty Images

All of that impacts the atmosphere but it doesn't necessarily mean an event isn't successful. Since becoming a WGC, the Doral tournament has been won by Tiger Woods twice, Phil Mickelson, Ernie Els, Patrick Reed and Dustin Johnson, among others. And following a golf course renovation prior to 2014, Doral's ""Blue Monster'' returned to its place among the toughest on the PGA Tour.

But some players have grumbled about the difficulty, and Trump has meddled in some golf course agronomy and set-up issues since taking over as owner of the property in 2012 -- although he readily agreed to some changes that were made prior to this year's event.

Trump's politically charged comments only added to a tenuous situation. Ty Votaw, vice president of global marketing for the PGA Tour, said the tour is sticking with its statement from January that pledged its commitment to the tournament and Miami area for now.

""Following the tournament, all parties will examine the Cadillac Championship's successes on all levels and determine what's in store for the future,'' the statement said.

In 2013, the PGA Tour announced a 10-year contract extension with Trump National Doral through the 2023 event. But that deal is contingent upon title sponsorship, and with Cadillac's run all but over, the tournament's future is in question.

Finding title sponsors is a constant challenge for the PGA Tour and commissioner Tim Finchem, and it becomes more of an issue with a WGC, which commands a higher price.

But as one agent who wished to not be identified said, ""Finchem has a history of pulling off miracles. He's done it a number of times even when the economy was horrible. Don't put it past him.''

A departure from Doral would be a shame, considering the history. Billy Casper won the inaugural Doral Country Club Open Invitational in 1962, beating Paul Bonderson by a stroke at 283, 5 under par. A year later, Sam Snead finished runner-up to Dan Sikes. Nicklaus was a shot behind Casper in 1964 but would go on to win the tournament twice. Lee Trevino, Andy Bean, Hubert Green, Raymond Floyd (three times), Lanny Wadkins and Ben Crenshaw were among the other winners.

The tournament suffered a lull in the early 2000s after a sponsorship change, but was rejuvenated again around the time Ford became title sponsor in 2003.

That helped get Mickelson -- who had an endorsement with the company at the time -- into the field and Woods also returned. The two had a memorable duel that went down to the final hole in 2005 and they battled again the next year, with Woods coming out on top both times.

The following year, in 2007, the PGA Tour schedule saw significant change with the advent of the FedEx Cup and playoffs. The Doral event, as it was known, changed to the world event that had previously been called the American Express Championship (Woods has won it a total of seven times). It was played at various sites, including twice in Spain, twice in Ireland and once in England.

Mickelson remembers those duels with Woods well, but has no issue with the present formation of the tournament.

""What I like about it is Miami's a kind of town that encompasses the world,'' said Mickelson, one of 13 players in the field this year. ""You see people from every part of the world. Then to have a World Golf Championship in Miami and you see some of the best players from all different parts of the world.

""It's a good fit, I think. It's a good golf course that has historical value going back to the 1960s, when Doris and Al Kaskel made Doral. To see it as a World Golf Championship event is a good thing.''

Mickelson is correct that, in theory, Miami is perfect for a WGC. But the sponsorship issue, as well as the course owner, conspire to make some uneasy times around here.

""I would prefer it to be a regular PGA Tour event like the old days,'' Compton said. ""It was the best event in Florida.''",[]

""I don't have a choice but to go out there and do my job and try to get people to come,"" Carmelo Anthony said of his plan to take a more hands-on approach to free-agent recruiting this summer. AP Photo/Julie Jacobson

Last summer, Anthony was mostly hands-off as Knicks president Phil Jackson, general manager Steve Mills and then-coach Derek Fisher met with free agents. The team missed on some of its targets (Greg Monroe, DeAndre Jordan) and signed center Robin Lopez, guard Arron Afflalo and forward Derrick Williams.

This summer, the Knicks' record might hinder the club's attempts to land some of the top free agents on the market, which will include Kevin Durant, Mike Conley and Al Horford.

One potential free agent, point guard Rajon Rondo, has made it known that he is hesitant to play in the Knicks' triangle offense.

""The triangle's not really a good look for me, I don't think,"" Rondo said last month.

Anthony disagrees. He told reporters Monday that Rondo would be a great fit in New York's offense.

""I think Rondo -- just me personally, I don't want to be tampering -- but I've heard he said he wouldn't thrive in a system like this,"" Anthony said. ""I think he'd be perfect in a system like this.""

Anthony said it is a ""misconception"" for point guards to think they'll be restricted by the Knicks' triangle offense, which this season ranks in the bottom third in the league in pick-and-roll plays and points off drives.

""Some of the keys of our offense is penetration, getting in the paint, pushing the pace, transition, creating in the paint for bigs, for yourself, everybody else,"" Anthony said. ""I think a point guard would love that, especially a point guard who can penetrate, create for yourself, create for others. I think it's a perfect opportunity for him.""

Jackson, Anthony and the Knicks will need to rely solely on trades and free agency to improve the roster this summer, as the club will send its 2016 first-round pick to Toronto as part of the 2013 trade for Andrea Bargnani.

1. Manny Pacquiao (57-6-2)

Pacquiao, the Filipino icon, campaigned hard to get Floyd Mayweather Jr. in the ring and he finally did on May 2 for their massively-hyped fight to determine the pound-for-pound king and the ruler of the generation. Pacquiao got off to a solid start but then Mayweather took him apart over the second half of the fight to win a unanimous decision in a forgettable fight. Pacquiao claimed afterward that a shoulder injury in training 212 weeks before the fight hampered him. Sure enough, two days after the bout he was diagnosed with a torn right rotator cuff. He had surgery and plans to return for a fight few are excited about, a third match with titlist Timothy Bradley Jr. (33-1-1), whom Pacquiao dominated twice but got ripped off in their first controversial fight. It would have been much better had Pacquiao and Top Rank gone with either of the other two opponents in the running, Terence Crawford or Amir Khan.

Next: April 9 vs. Bradley

2. Timothy Bradley Jr. (33-1-1)

On June 27, Bradley looked as good as he has in a long time, as he dominated Jessie Vargas for most of the fight and won a unanimous decision and a vacant title -- but not before he got badly rocked in the final moments of the fight. After that win he fired careerlong trainer Joel Diaz and hooked up with Teddy Atlas, who led him into battle against former lightweight titlist Brandon Rios on Nov. 7. The pairing with Atlas, combined with Rios' woeful conditioning, made for perhaps the best performance of Bradley's career as he totally dominated and knocked Rios down twice in the ninth round for the knockout victory that sent Rios into retirement. Next up, Bradley, who vacated his title instead of making a mandatory defense, will meet Manny Pacquiao (57-6-2) in a fight nobody is anxious to see after their first two forgettable matches.

Next: April 9 vs. Pacquiao

3. Keith Thurman (26-0)

The hard-hitting and exciting Thurman made the first defense of his full title impressively on March 7, as he headlined the first Premier Boxing Champions card on NBC in boxing's return to network television prime time. He outslugged and outboxed Robert Guerrero in an exciting fight to set himself up for what will undoubtedly be big business down the road. In defense No. 2, Thurman had a Tampa, Florida, homecoming fight and survived a near knockdown from a body shot in an otherwise dominant eighth-round knockout of former titlist Luis Collazo on July 11 on the debut of Premier Boxing Champions on ESPN. A much-anticipated showdown against former titlist Shawn Porter (26-1-1) was scheduled for Mach 12 on CBS in prime time, but the fight was postponed because Thurman was banged up in a car accident.

Next: TBA vs. Porter

4. Kell Brook (35-0)

Brook, who outpointed Shawn Porter to win a belt in August 2014, has made two dominant defenses, knockouts of Jo Jo Dan and Frankie Gavin. He and promoter Eddie Hearn talk about making fights against big names but have failed to deliver. When a fight with Brandon Rios fell apart, Brook was set to face Diego Chaves on Oct. 24 before a rib injury forced Brook to cancel. Next he will fight Canadian mandatory challenger Kevin Bizier (25-2), another fight nobody is asking for. The fight that makes sense for everyone is a showdown with British countryman Amir Khan (31-3).

Next: March 26 vs. Bizier.

5. Danny Garcia (32-0)

Garcia was the unified junior welterweight champion and defended against the likes of Lucas Matthysse, Zab Judah, Amir Khan and Erik Morales. But trouble making weight led to two nontitle bouts in a row, a quality decision win over titlist Lamont Peterson at 143 pounds in April and a second-round knockout of overmatched club fighter Rod Salka in two rounds in August 2014 in one of the most massive mismatches in recent history. When it was clear he'd never see 140 again, Garcia moved up to welterweight and debuted in the division on Aug. 1, mowing down faded former titlist Paulie Malignaggi in nine one-sided rounds. On Jan. 23, Garcia headlined the debut of Premier Boxing Champions on Fox in prime time and although he struggled early against Robert Guerrero, he came on strong in the second half of the fight to win a vacant belt.

Next: TBA

6. Amir Khan (31-3)

Khan, a former unified junior welterweight titlist, hoped that a one-sided decision against former two-division titleholder Devon Alexander in December 2014 would put him in position to face either Mayweather or Pacquiao but they fought each other instead. Khan instead outpointed former junior welterweight titlist Chris Algieri on May 29 in an entertaining fight but one Khan had a lot more trouble than anyone expected. Khan didn't fight for the rest of the year as he held out hope for Mayweather or Pacquiao and got neither as Mayweather faced Andre Berto and retired, and Pacquiao took a third fight with Bradley. Although Khan is the mandatory challenger for newly crowned titleholder Danny Garcia, who knocked Khan out at 140 pounds, and there was also the prospect of a big summer fight with British countryman and titleholder Kell Brook, he shocked everyone when a fight with middleweight champion Canelo Alvarez (46-1-1) was announced. That is also a very big and entirely unexpected match.

Next: May 7 vs. Alvarez

7. Shawn Porter (26-1-1)

Porter didn't look so good as he lost a majority decision and his world title to England's Kell Brook in August 2014. For his March 13 return, Porter faced last-minute substitute Erick Bone, who put up a good fight but got knocked out in the fifth round, setting up Porter for a big one. He was the underdog when he met former titleholder Adrien Broner in an excellent matchup on June 20 and took Broner to school. Porter fought very well and cruised to a unanimous decision despite getting knocked down in the opening moments of the 12th round. Next up is a showdown with titleholder Keith Thurman (26-0), but it was postponed from March 12 because Thurman was slightly injured in a car accident.

Next: TBA vs. Thurman

8. Jessie Vargas (27-1)

Vargas, a former junior welterweight titleholder, moved up in weight and challenged Timothy Bradley Jr. for a vacant belt in June 2015. Although Vargas lost a unanimous decision, he nearly knocked Bradley out in the final seconds of the fight. Vargas didn't get the rematch he wanted but instead got a chance to face Sadam Ali on March 5 on HBO for the belt Bradley vacated and he made the most of his opportunity. Vargas looked sharp in an impressive ninth-round knockout victory.

Next: TBA

9. Errol Spence Jr. (19-0)

Spence was the best pro prospect from the 2012 U.S. Olympic team and has lived up to the hype so far in the pros as he has looked impressive fight in and fight. Spence, who looks every bit like a future world titleholder, looked good in November as he smoked Mexico's Alejandro Barrera in a fifth-round knockout victory to push the 2015 ESPN.com prospect of the year a step closer to a mandatory shot at the belt held by Kell Brook. He is due to headline a Premier Boxing Champions card on NBC against former junior welterweight titlist Chris Algieri (21-2), by far Spence's best opponent.

Next: April 16 vs. Algieri

10. Chris Algieri (21-2)

Algieri, a former junior welterweight titlist, turned in an excellent performance in a close decision loss to Amir Khan in May 2015 but rebounded with a hard-fought decision win against Erick Bone in December. Next up he has the daunting task of facing super talented Errol Spence Jr. (19-0) on NBC in prime time in what is supposed to be Spence's big step-up fight.

espn.com,,A stalemate emerges in the daily fantasy sports Nevada discussion,"['Ben Fawkes', 'Darren Rovell', 'David Purdum', 'Mackenzie Kraemer', 'Steve Fainaru', 'Graham Mckean', 'Arash Markazi', 'Paula Lavigne', 'Ryan Rodenberg', 'Tim Fiorvanti']","LAS VEGAS -- Some of the most powerful decision-makers in the gambling world -- the governor of Nevada, executives from the state's largest sportsbooks, officials from gaming control and the CEOs of the two leading daily fantasy sports operators -- were in the same room for over four hours Monday at Las Vegas City Hall.

While no definitive agreements came out of the gathering, one thing was clear: The outdated gambling laws in the United States don't make a lot of sense at this point.

""So if I'm in Indiana, I can't bet on the Colts or the Pacers, but I can bet on their players?"" a perplexed Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval quipped. Editor's Picks Rodenberg: DFS state-by-state tracker What is the legal status of daily fantasy sports in every state? Ryan Rodenberg breaks down the situation in all 50 states in a file that will be updated as news warrants.

Sandoval sat in the center of 11 members of the Gambling Policy Committee, who were perched on an elevated panel at the front of the auditorium. To his right was Gaming Control Board Chairman A.G. Burnett, who five months ago ruled that daily fantasy sports constitutes sports betting and would require a gambling license to operate in the state moving forward. The daily fantasy operators for leading companies FanDuel and DraftKings quickly bolted from the state.

Now, it's clear that Nevada wants their business back.

The crowd of roughly around 100 people consisted of sportsbook directors, fantasy industry proponents, reporters and attorneys. In the front row, DraftKings CEO Jason Robins, wearing a blue-gray jacket, salmon pink shirt and brown pants, sat next to FanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles, who sported a navy suit, white shirt and blue tie. The two executives are known rivals in the industry, but when faced with questions and criticisms from a sometimes skeptical panel, they were clearly on the same side Monday. The bottom line: They're reluctant to seek a gambling license, because it could risk their legality in other states.

Robbins and Eccles scribbled down notes and whispered in each other's ears, while waiting to give their side of the story. A seat down to their left was Joe Asher, CEO of William Hill's U.S. sports betting operations and without question the most frank and aggressive presenter.

""When we talk about daily fantasy sports betting, we need to be clear and call it what it is,"" Asher emphasized. ""It is gambling and needs to be regulated as such. The argument advanced by some that daily fantasy sports betting should not be regulated as gambling is ridiculous.""

Robins and Eccles followed Asher's testimony and disagreed with the William CEO that the type of regulation applied to the state's gambling entities is appropriate for their product. Robins described Nevada's regulation requirements as ""onerous,"" but later conceded, along with Eccles, that he was not fully versed on the state's regulatory requirements.

The bigger sticking point than the regulations, though, is accepting the tag of being a form of sports betting, something that is legal in only four states -- and extensively only in Nevada. If the daily fantasy companies accept that in Nevada, it may hurt legislative efforts in other states, because of the federal prohibition on sports betting.

""It was clear that they weren't going to seek licenses,"" Sandoval told ESPN in an interview after the meeting. ""It's a conundrum for them, because if they seek a license here then it's sports betting, which would make it [where]they couldn't get a license anywhere else because of the federal law.""

That hasn't stopped DraftKings and FanDuel from seeking a gambling license in the United Kingdom, though.

""The U.K. is a completely different legal system,"" Eccles said after the meeting. ""So whenever we work there, we want to be compliant with that law. It's similar in Nevada. If we can get a framework that works for us here then that's good, but we have to be mindful for how that looks in the other states.""

Robins declined to comment after the hearing.

Sandoval concluded Monday's session by setting future meetings on the topic, tentatively scheduled for May, August and October. The Nevada legislature doesn't meet again until January 2017, so for now, it looks a lot like a stalemate.

""I don't know if I'd call it a stalemate,"" Sandoval said. ""I think there was a lot of agreement in terms of their willingness to cooperate moving forward. As I mentioned, is there a regime under our current regulatory framework or is there a type of licensure that we need to consider for this new innovation in gaming?""

espn.com,,Felix Sturm quito el invicto en casa a Fedor Chudinov,"['Escritor Senior De Espn Com', 'Carlos Narv Ez Rosario Especial Para Espn Digital', 'Bernardo Pilatti', 'Espn Digital', 'Salvador Rodr Guez Espn Digital', 'Dan Rafael']","Un resumen de las mejores peleas de la semana pasada en todo el mundo:

Sabado en Oberhausen, Alemania

Felix Sturm G12 Fedor Chudinov

Gana un titulo peso super mediano

Tarjetas: 115-113 (dos veces), 114-114

Records: Sturm (40-5-3, 18 KO); Chudinov (14-1, 10 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: El 9 de mayo en Frankfurt, Alemania, Chudinov, ruso de 28 anos, gano una decision dividida contra Sturm, aleman de 37 anos, para llevarse un titulo mundial vacante. Luego de una defensa exitosa en septiembre, Chudinov regreso al territorio de Sturm para darle la revancha. Aunque recibio una decision justa en el primer encuentro, Chudinov no tuvo tanta suerte en la revancha, ya que lo dieron como perdedor por decision mayoritaria en una pelea que parecia haber ganado con claridad.

No obstante, Sturm levanto el cinturon y ahora ha ganado cinco titulos mundiales, entre ellos cuatro cinturones de peso mediano y este de peso super mediano. Puede que no tenga mucho tiempo para disfrutarlo, ya que, segun el campamento de Chudinov, tiene una clausula de revancha para un tercer encuentro, que tambien se llevaria a cabo en Alemania.

Sturm, quien llego a la pelea con una mala racha de 0-2-1, recibio muchos golpes fuertes de un Chudinov mas potente, quien hizo trabajar una poderosa mano derecha ademas de su jab, y fue por Sturm desde el principio. Chudinov probablemente fue superado en algunos de los asaltos iniciales, pero ya se lo veia muy fuerte para la mitad de la pelea, y parecia tener el control. En el 10 asalto, Sturm sufrio un corte sobre el ojo derecho como consecuencia de un choque accidental de cabezas.

El mejor round de Sturm probablemente fue el 12do, que, segun CompuBox, fue el unico asalto de la pelea en el que aterrizo mas golpes (24-22) que Chudinov. De hecho, las estadisticas de CompuBox favorecen abrumadoramente a Chudinov, quien arrojo mas golpes y tambien aterrizo muchos mas, ademas de tener mas potencia en los mismos. Aterrizo 297 de 1022 golpes (29 por ciento), mientras que Sturm conecto 184 de 605 (30 por ciento).

En la misma cartelera, el ex dos veces retador de titulo de peso pesado, Francesco Pianeta (32-2-1, 18 KO), italiano de 31 anos basado en Alemania, noqueo a Hasan Olaki (6-3, 3 KO), turco de 36 anos, en el quinto asalto de un combate ridiculamente desparejo. Pianeta habia sido noqueado por Wladimir Klitschko en el sexto round de una pelea de campeonato en 2013, y por Ruslan Chagaev en el primer asalto por un titulo secundario en su pelea anterior el pasado mes de julio.

Sabado en Phoenix

Jessie Magdaleno KO7 Rey Perez

Peso pluma

Records: Magdaleno (23-0, 17 KO); Perez (20-8, 5 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Magdaleno, zurdo de 24 anos de Las Vegas, ha sido un enigma. Tiene un gran talento y era considerado un prospecto imperdible cuando se hizo profesional en 2010. Sin embargo, ha tenido un desarrollo lento y se ha visto obstaculizado por problemas para alcanzar el peso y por dudas sobre su deseo y su etica de trabajo. No hace mucho tiempo, Magdaleno, hermano menor del contendiente de peso ligero Diego Magdaleno, el manager Frank Espinoza y directivos de Top Rank tuvieron una reunion en la que le dijeron a Magdaleno que era hora de tomarse su carrera en serio. Ya veremos que pasa con eso, pero por ahora parece bien encaminado. Magdaleno llego en forma y en peso a su evento principal de ""Solo Boxeo Tecate"" por UNIMAS, a pesar de que Perez, quien reemplazo de ultimo momento al filipino Edward Mansito (13-3-2, 7 KOs), se excedio por siete libras al peso acordado.

Magdaleno domino la pelea de principio a fin, y finalmente mando a guardar a Perez con un perfecto gancho de izquierda al cuerpo que lo dejo en la lona por la cuenta completa a los 2 minutos, 51 segundos del septimo asalto. Si Magdaleno logra mantener el rumbo, podria conseguir un combate ante el campeon mundial de peso pluma junior Nonito Donaire este ano.

Sabado en Monterrey, Mexico

Francisco Rodriguez G10 Ramon Garcia

Peso mosca

Tarjetas: 99-88, 99-89, 96-91

Records: Rodriguez (18-4-1, 11 KO); Garcia (20-8-1, 12 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Rodriguez, mexicano de 22 anos, ex campeon unificado de peso paja, y el ex campeon de peso mosca junior Garcia, mexicano zurdo de 33 anos, llegaron a esta pelea con gran necesidad de ganar.

Rodriguez, quien supero al japones Katsunari Takayama para unificar dos titulos mundiales de peso paja en la pelea del ano 2014 de ESPN.com, habia perdido dos combates seguidos ante oponentes de calidad en Donnie Nietes, en un combate por un titulo mundial de peso mosca junior, y ante el ex campeon de peso paja Moises Fuentes. Garcia ha perdido tres peleas consecutivas, incluyendo una decision por un titulo mundial vacante de peso mosca junior ante Javier Mendoza en 2014.

Al final fue Rodriguez, quien peleaba de local, el peleador que se mostro mas agresivo y certero con sus golpes para llevarse el triunfo que tanto necesitaba en una pelea entretenida. Gano la pelea de manera bastante dominante, tras derribar a Garcia tres veces para imponerse comodamente por decision.

Un choque accidental de cabezas abrio un corte sobre el ojo derecho de Garcia en el cuarto asalto. En el septimo, Rodriguez derribo a Garcia dos veces, la primera con un golpe de derecha. Luego Rodriguez cruzo corriendo el ring e inmediatamente volvio a derribarlo con la derecha. Garcia sobrevivio los ultimos dos minutos del segmento, pero volvio a tocar la lona en el octavo asalto, cuando Rodriguez le conecto un gancho de izquierda que le obligo a apoyar una rodilla.

En el respaldo en el peso ligero junior, el prospecto de 21 anos Carlos Diaz (19-0, 10 KO), de Mexico, se mantuvo invicto al anotar un derribo en el primer asalto para llevarse luego la decision sobre su compatriota Ulises Perez (15-4, 7 KO). Los jueces marcaron 98-91, 98-91 y 96-93 a su favor.

Viernes en Atlantic City, N.J.

Adam Lopez G10 Mario Munoz

Peso junior pluma

Tarjetas: 98-92 (dos veces), 97-93

Records: Lopez (15-0, 7 KO); Munoz (16-1-1, 10 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Lopez, pugil de 25 anos de San Antonio, continuo su camino a convertirse en contendiente con una renida pero clara victoria por decision sobre Munoz, mexicano de 25 anos, en el evento principal de una cartelera cuadruple de ""ShoBox: The New Generation"", de Showtime, una serie en la que Lopez se ha convertido en una figura habitual. Lopez, quien sufrio un feo corte sobre el ojo derecho, supero a un Munoz aguerrido y conecto los golpes mas eficaces para abrirse el camino a una victoria que no fue facil. Hubo muchos cabezazos accidentales y tacticas asperas.

""Esta fue mi pelea mas dura como profesional y creo que he demostrado mucho"", dijo Lopez. ""Demostre que soy capaz de pelear contra la adversidad. El corte en el ojo definitivamente fue un factor en mi rendimiento durante un par de asaltos, pero baje el pedal hacia la medalla y lo supere. Yo conecte los golpes mas contundentes. Este es el tipo de peleas de las que puedo aprender. Persevere a pesar del corte y todos los choques de cabeza. Este es el tipo de peleas que te hacen mejor. No se aprende dando palizas. Munoz fue un buen luchador y me conecto algunos golpes buenos, pero definitivamente yo fui el mejor peleador y no habia dudas de que ganaria la decision. Crei que podria detenerlo en el octavo o el noveno, pero no sucedio"".

Munoz estaba decepcionado con la decision de los jueces, y dijo: ""Yo soy el mejor luchador. Aterrice mas combinaciones. Mi cara no esta marcada, mira a la suya. Me lastimo mas con sus golpes bajos y cabezazos que con sus golpes. Me encantaria enfrentarlo de nuevo"".

Ronald Ellis E8 Jerry Odom

Peso super mediano

Tarjetas: 76-76 (dos veces), 78-74 Ellis

Records: Ellis (12-0-1, 10 KO); Odom (13-2-1, 12 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Ellis, pugil de 26 anos de Lynn, Massachusetts, y Odom, pugil 22 de Washington, D.C., disputaron un empate legitimo en una pelea muy pareja, con gran accion al principio antes de convertirse en un combate de boxeo. A pesar de no haber obtenido la victoria, Odom repunto bastante luego de haber sufrido un feo nocaut en el tercer asalto ante Samuel Clarkson en su ultima pelea en julio.

""Empece fuerte y demostre que pertenezco aqui, en un espectaculo televisado a nivel nacional"", dijo Ellis. ""Estoy contento con lo que hice. Esta noche demostre que puedo contrarrestar a un luchador activo. Se recibir golpes. Tambien puedo ser un boxeador-pegador. Odom trato de hacer lo suyo al principio, pero simplemente no pudo hacerlo conmigo. Segui el consejo de mi entrenador. Golpee, me quede atras. Use mi gancho de izquierda. Creo que realmente lo lastime un par de veces. Gane la pelea. Estoy seguro. Primero nos golpeamos y luego le mostre mi boxeo. Fue facil. Gane la pelea. El nunca me lastimo. Ya volvere. Veran mucho de mi en el futuro"".

Odom tambien creyo haber ganado, y dijo, ""No puedo estar decepcionado con la decision porque pelee con el corazon. Se que lo lastime. El me lastimo un poco en el segundo, pero me recupere y segui adelante. Creo que lo logre en los ultimos asaltos. Trabaje al cuerpo. Creo que hice un poco de dano. Ellis parecia lastimado. No tengo la intencion de faltar el respeto, pero creo que definitivamente hice lo suficiente para ganar, aunque los jueves lo hayan visto de otra manera"".

O'Shanique Foster KOT7 Lavisas Williams

Peso ligero

Records: Foster (10-1, 7 KO); Williams (8-1-1, 3 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Foster, de 22 anos y de Orange, Texas, sufrio su primera derrota en una terrible actuacion por ""ShoBox"", en noviembre, pero ahora ha ganado dos peleas seguidas despues de noquear a Williams, un zurdo de 24 anos y de Rochester, Nueva York. Foster anoto cuatro caidas en el combate. Envio a Williams a la lona en el segundo, tercero, cuarto y septimo asalto. Despues de la caida en la septima ronda, la esquina de Williams tiro la toalla y el arbitro Shada Murdaugh detuvo la pelea a los 52 segundos.

""Este es un gran alivio para mi '', dijo Foster. ""Me siento genial. Creo que la gente vio un atisbo del tipo de boxeador que puedo ser esta noche. No fui yo en mi primera pelea de 'ShoBox'. No se si me quede inmovil bajo las luces o si he perdido a causa del clima frio fuera, pero no estaba tan confiado para esa pelea como esta noche y eso afecto a mi rendimiento.

""Tuve un tremendo campo de entrenamiento, mi mejor campo de la historia, que jugo un papel importante en mi confianza esta noche. Doy gracias a Dios por la oportunidad de luchar por television nacional de nuevo y ya estoy deseando que llegue la proxima vez"".

Williams dijo que nunca se metio en la pelea. ""Por alguna razon, simplemente no pude soltarme"", dijo. ""Estaba resfriado, pero no voy a quitarle nada a Foster. El me tiro al suelo, pero en realidad pense que me empujo la mayoria de las veces. He aprendido algo de esta noche. No puedo hacer lo que hice. No puedo esperar a mi oponente. Tengo que atacar primero. Pronto estare de regreso"".

Christopher Brooker E8 John Magda

Peso super mediano

Tarjetas: 77-74 Magda, 78-74 Brooker, 76-76

Records: Brooker (7-1-1, 5 KO); Magda (11-0-1, 7 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Alerta de robo! Brooker, de 24 anos, fue descaradamente privado de una victoria gracias a la puntuacion increiblemente fuera de lugar de parte del juez Donald Givens, cuyo nombre puede sonar familiar. Givens, quien asombrosamente anoto la pelea para Magda, de 24 anos y de Rutherford, Nueva Jersey, fue uno de los jueces en la infame decision mayoritaria otorgada a Paul Williams contra Erislandy Lara en su pelea de alto perfil por HBO en Atlantic City en 2011. Las puntuaciones de esa pelea fueron tan malas que el Consejo de Control Atletico del Estado de Nueva Jersey suspendio indefinidamente los tres jueces.

Givens estuvo fuera de actividad durante cuatro anos y no se les permitio hacer de juez de nuevo hasta volver en junio de 2015. Y ahora otra vez ha entregado una tarjeta brutalmente cuestionable en esta lucha, donde la tarjeta de empate del juez Larry Layton fue casi tan mala como la antemencionada.

El mucho mas ocupado y preciso, Brooker, parecio dominar la pelea, una que aparentaba facil de puntuar. De acuerdo con las estadisticas de CompuBox, Brooker supero a Magda, un zurdo, por un margen significativo, aterrizando casi el doble de golpes. En general, Brooker aterrizo 152 de 481 golpes (32 por ciento) y Magda conecto 78 de 268 golpes (29 por ciento). Los anunciadores de Showtime en su total tuvieron a Brooker ganando con claridad.

Brooker quedo extremadamente molesto por los puntajes y con razon.

""No entreno ocho horas al dia, siete dias a la semana para obtener este tipo de decision"", dijo Brooker. ""Eso no fue un empate. He ganado claramente la pelea. No quiero quitarle nada a Magda. Es un peleador fuerte y respondio bien, pero pude mostrar a todo el mundo que el trabajo duro le gana al talento cualquier dia. Gane esta pelea. Yo fui el agresor. Lance algunos grandes golpes. Mi derecha fue clave. En el principio Magda fue rapido, pero pude ubicar mis golpes y se que hice lo suficiente para ganar la pelea"".

Magda no fue muy convincente al intentar defender el resultado, diciendo: ""Me siento bien, pero esta fue una pelea dura. Se quedo sobre mi y siguio adelante. Pero fue mas fuerte de lo que pensaba. Voy a tener que ver la grabacion de nuevo, pero pienso que el conecto los golpes mas eficaces''.

Viernes en Los Angeles

Diego De La Hoya KO4 Arturo Badillo

Peso pluma

Records: De La Hoya (14-0, 8 KO); Badillo (21-10, 19 KO)

Comentario de rafael: De la Hoya, de 21 anos y de Mexico, el primo hermano del promotor y del personaje famoso Oscar de la Hoya, es un prospecto de calidad que continuo ganando experiencia muy necesaria cuando desarmo al veterano, Badillo, de 28 anos y tambien de Mexico.

Boxeando en el evento principal de la serie de Golden Boy ""LA Fight Club"", De La Hoya descargo sobre Badillo desde el principio, sobre todo con un ataque al cuerpo duro para tomar inmediatamente el control en la primera ronda. De la Hoya, quien es entrenado por Joel Diaz, sufrio un pequeno corte sobre su ojo izquierdo en la segunda ronda, pero pudo manejarlo bien. Badillo vino a pelear e hizo un excelente esfuerzo, pero De la Hoya fue demasiado rapido y demasiado fuerte para el. Golpeo a Badillo durante toda la pelea hasta hacerlo caer con un gancho de izquierda al cuerpo en el cuarto asalto. Badillo bajo y quedo de rodillas, escupio su protector bucal y el arbitro Jerry Cantu lo elimino con el conteo a 1 minuto, 11 segundos.

""En un primer momento, la emocion se robo lo mejor de mi y estaba tratando de buscar un nocaut, pero en la segunda ronda me di cuenta de que estaba haciendo su juego"", dijo De La Hoya. ""Decidi cambiar el ritmo, tomarme mi tiempo y solo jugar a lo seguro. Por el tercer round, me di cuenta de que se estaba cansando y fue entonces cuando decidi aprovechar y dedicar la tercera ronda a noquearlo"".

Badillo fue noqueado por cuarta vez consecutiva y perdio por novena vez en sus ultimas 10 peleas con cada derrota en ese periodo por nocaut.

""Yo sabia sobre el estilo de pelea de Diego De La Hoya y estaba preparado para pelear contra un rival muy duro"", dijo Badillo. ""Me senti comodo en el ring en el primer par de asaltos. No me siento herido, pero esa toma al higado me dolio. Por desgracia, esas cosas pasan y todo lo que puedo hacer es volver al gimnasio y entrenar para mi proxima pelea"".

Viernes en Sloan, Iowa

John Vera Jr. KOT4 Ayi Bruce

Peso junior mediano

Records: Vera Jr. (13-0, 8 KO); Bruce (23-13, 15 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: En el evento principal de la tarjeta televisada por CBS Sports Net del promotor Greg Cohen, Vera, de 27 anos y de Fort Worth, Texas, domino a Bruce, de 29 anos, nativo de Ghana con base en Albany, Nueva York, camino al nocaut. Aunque Bruce perdio su cuarta pelea consecutiva y cayo a 3-10 en sus ultimas 13 peleas en realidad era un paso en la competencia para el poco experimentado, Vera, que entro en la pelea habiendo enfrentado a oponentes con un record combinado de 36 -111-3. No fue una prueba en si misma, pero Vera, un zurdo, la aprobo mientras hizo caer tres veces a Bruce en la cuarta ronda. Las dos primeras caidas vinieron de ganchos de derecha al cuerpo y la final llego en un gancho de derecha a la cabeza. Bruce supero el conteo, pero no tenia interes en continuar y el arbitro, Adam Pollack, detuvo la pelea a los 2 minutos.

Tony Luis G8 Samuel Amoako

Peso ligero

Tarjetas: 80-72 (tres veces)

Records: Luis (21-3, 7 KO); Amoako (21-8, 15 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: En abril de 2015, Luis, de 28 anos y de Ontario, viajo a Inglaterra para una oportunidad por un titulo mundial interino de peso ligero, pero perdio una decision altamente competitiva ante Derry Mathews. En el camino de regreso, Luis consiguio su segunda victoria consecutiva de modo dominante contra Amoako, de 31 anos y nativo de Ghana con base en Silver Springs, Maryland, quien cayo en su cuarta pelea consecutiva. Luis gano con facilidad contra Amoako, que no tuvo respuestas y estuvo en modo de supervivencia al final.

Tambien en la tarjeta, el prospecto de peso welter de 20 anos, Malik Hawkins (6-0, 5 KOs), ex estrella amateur de Baltimore, necesito 2 minutos, 3 segundos para aplastar a Cody Pederson (1-1, 1 KO), de 26 anos y de Libery Missouri, derribandolo tres veces con un dominante nocaut en el primer round.

Viernes en Puerto Madryn, Argentina

Omar Narvaez KOT8 Jesus Vargas

Peso gallo

Records: Narvaez (45-2-2, 24 KO); Vargas (14-4-1, 10 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: En diciembre de 2014, el titular del peso gallo junior desde hace mucho tiempo, Narvaez, de 40 anos y de Argentina, quedo impresionado por el prodigio japones Naoya Inoue en el segundo asalto para poner fin a su reinado. Despues de una ausencia de 10 meses, Narvaez regreso en octubre para la decision de 10 asaltos ante Diego Liriano. Narvaez, un zurdo, que tambien tuvo un largo reinado con un titulo de peso mosca, recogio su segunda victoria consecutiva mientras obligo a Vargas, de 23 anos y de Venezuela, a retirarse en su banco un segundo pasado de el octavo asalto y termino su racha ganadora de cuatro combates (contra oposicion muy debil). Narvaez domino la pelea y le dio una golpiza a Vargas con un ataque a dos manos en la septima ronda mientras este ultimo busco cubrirse en una esquina. Finalizo el asalto, pero se permanecio en su esquina despues de la misma dando por finalizado el encuentro. Narvaez esta ahora esperando una revancha con Inoue.",[]

espn.com,,"Cardinals' Mike Leake, Yadier Molina profess mutual admiration",['Mark Saxon'],"JUPITER, Fla. -- Mike Leake found out Yadier Molina would catch his first spring training outing a couple of days ago.

""I mean, it's kind of a surreal moment, just because I'm throwing to a future Hall of Famer,"" Leake said. ""Not many people can say that.""

Leake, who signed a five-year, $80 million contract with the St. Louis Cardinals in December, has been a borderline elite starting pitcher without having borderline elite stuff. He had a 3.70 ERA and 3.88 fielding independent pitching while pitching with a fastball that averaged 90.7 mph last season, per FanGraphs, in an extreme hitters' park in Cincinnati.

Leake, 28, has excelled largely by doing all the little things well, including fielding his position and even adding value with his bat at times. Presumably he could benefit from Molina's experience and talent, which is why Molina's return to catching Wednesday -- he did not hit -- was well timed for the team. The Gold Glove catcher and the team's new finesse pitcher began the process of getting acquainted.

""I think he and Yadi are going to have fun together,"" manager Mike Matheny said. ""I think Yadi's the kind of catcher who can help Mike be very creative. He has the kind of stuff to be very creative, so I think they're going to enjoy the chess-match cat-and-mouse game. Those kinds of guys are fun to catch.""

Leake gave up two hits and struck out two Miami Marlins over two innings. Randal Grichuk threw out Justin Bour at the plate in the second inning, forcing Molina to make a swipe tag, which is exactly how he tore the ligament in his left thumb in the first place. Leake, who was on the San Francisco Giants at the time, wasn't aware that that was how Molina had gotten injured.

""At least Bour, for a big guy, made kind of a gingerly slide,"" Leake said. ""He took it easy on him.""

Molina, who has been pushing to get back on the field all spring, said he continues to progress in strengthening his surgically repaired left thumb. He said trainers haven't told him yet when he can begin taking batting practice or when he might be able to hit in games. He was in the on-deck circle when Jedd Gyorko got thrown out trying to steal in the second inning. He caught the next inning, then was replaced by pinch hitter Mike Ohlman.

Molina said that while tagging out Bour, he had no flashbacks to the pain of Sept. 20, when the Chicago Cubs' Anthony Rizzo slid into his glove hand and injured his thumb.

""I was ready. I wasn't thinking about anything,"" Molina said. ""I just tried to get that guy out, and thank God that everything went right.""

Molina, who has hit .242 with a .629 OPS against Leake in 34 plate appearances, said he looks forward to working with a pitcher who has such elite command. For his career, Leake has averaged 2.3 walks per nine innings.

""He's fun to catch,"" Molina said. ""He puts the ball where he wants to, he locates and he splits the corners.""",[]
espn.com,,"As Hanley Ramirez learns to play first, he must recall how to hit, too",['Scott Lauber'],"FORT MYERS, Fla. -- A few weeks before spring training began, at the Boston Red Sox's annual winter festival at Foxwoods Resort Casino, Hanley Ramirez was asked if he'd be interested in becoming a designated hitter once David Ortiz retires.

""Hell yeah,"" he said.

It was a moment of unbridled honesty, to say nothing of a window into how Ramirez may be approaching his latest positional switch. The 32-year-old realizes he must be a passable first baseman for the sake of the pitching staff and his fellow infielders. But with Ortiz planning to step away after this season, he also knows this whole first-base thing could be merely a one-year gig until he can focus all his energy on what he really likes to do: Mash.

And that would be all well and good but for one teeny, tiny detail: Ramirez is coming off the worst offensive season of his career.

Hanley Ramirez's transition to first base is getting plenty of attention at Red Sox camp. But after a disastrous 2015 at the plate, his defense isn't the only thing that needs work. Billie Weiss/Boston Red Sox/Getty Images

In some ways, it was the most underplayed aspect of Boston's disappointing 2015. Ramirez was a train wreck in left field, ranking as the majors' third-worst defender by costing his team 19 runs, according to Baseball Info Solutions. But he was nearly as lost at the plate. After bashing 10 home runs in April, he hit only nine the rest of the season and none after the All-Star break. He notched a career-low 12 doubles and slugged .426, tied for 56th among 100 American Leaguers with at least 425 plate appearances.

It was a stunning lack of production for a player who was offered a four-year, $88 million contract because of the power in his bat. Defense has never been Ramirez's strong suit, even at his natural shortstop position. He could always hit, though, entering last season as one of 10 active players with a .500 or better slugging percentage over at least 1,000 games.

So, while the Sox cross their fingers that Ramirez will be acceptable at first base, they're even more hopeful that last season wasn't the beginning of a decline in his offense.

""If he comes out and he's Hanley Ramirez, anywhere close to the Hanley Ramirez from when he was younger, he's going to do a lot of damage in this league and he's going to help this team be a better ballclub,"" hitting coach Chili Davis said. ""If he's consistent with good contact, the numbers are going to show up. That's just the way it is.""

More than anything, Davis chalks up Ramirez's struggles last season to two factors: a series of freak injuries that began in early May when he crashed into a wall in foul territory in left field and strained his left shoulder, and the distraction of having to play a new position and not being any good at it.

And the worse things got for Ramirez, the harder it was for Davis to help him. It wasn't that Ramirez was uncoachable, Davis says, but rather that he was set in his ways after nearly a decade as a successful major league hitter.

""Some relationships you can build right away, and that's based on trust,"" Davis said. ""But when you've got a player like Hanley, and even Papi [Ortiz], these guys have done some stuff in their career. So for me to walk in, the last thing I want is them to feel like I was changing them. A lot of times with players like that you need to kind of sit back and listen, and instead of taking giant leaps to get to know them, you take little, smaller steps. I had to be a little more cautious in how I approached him because he knew where he was trying to get to.""

By now, though, Davis believes he has gained Ramirez's trust. And over the past few weeks, he and assistant hitting coach Victor Rodriguez have asked Ramirez to try keeping both hands on the bat as he finishes his swing, a departure from his longstanding approach. By doing so, they think it will result in a more compact swing that allows Ramirez to connect with pitches that are down and away, a zone in which he was vulnerable last season.

So far, at least, so good. Ramirez has been making more consistent, hard contact in the early spring training games.

""Hopefully I don't run into the wall anymore, too."" Hanley Ramirez, on coming back from a disastrous 2015

Were just trying to find our timing, nice and easy, and try to be short, and let the ball travel a little,"" Ramirez said. ""Just one swing and one click and then youre right there. Thats what I need. It's early. Weve got to continue to work.

Said Davis of the two-handed approach: ""He believes in it, he's worked on it, and it's working for him right now. It keeps him on the ball longer. It keeps him using the whole field. I like it. I think he's done a real good job with it. There's some point where it'll probably get back to where he's finishing with the one-hand finish, but just by doing this, it's something he can always go back to. I think it'll help his natural swing.""

So, too, Davis says, will Ramirez's return to the infield. Even though he's learning to play first base, it figures to be an easier transition than left field for a natural shortstop.

And although injuries have been a recurring issue for Ramirez, limiting him to an average of 114 games per season since 2011, the Sox hope their offseason mandate that he drop a few pounds in order to increase his agility will help keep him healthy.

""Hopefully I don't run into the wall anymore, too,"" Ramirez said.

Said Davis: ""I think that affected his year a lot. He was on pace to have a really, really good year. I think after he came back and tried to get back to where he was and it didn't happen soon enough, the at-bats started compiling, and I think the frustration from that and the fact that he was playing in an unnatural position, I think it affected his offensive approach. I think he tried to do too much at times, which isn't necessary for him because he's a big, strong person that can do damage at an 80 percent level that most people have to put 100 percent into.""

Ramirez's importance to the lineup can't be overstated. For one thing, as the No. 5 hitter, he's the primary protection for Ortiz in the cleanup spot. He also represents Boston's only other truly fearsome middle-of-the-order power threat.

Most significantly, if Ramirez hits, it will help cover for many of the mistakes he's bound to make at first base and keep him in line for what he really wants: an offense-only role.",[]
espn.com,,"Team Liquid, Evil Geniuses and Team Secret top 3 remaining teams in Dota 2 Shanghai Major","['James Obscurica', 'James Bates', 'Alan Nahaz', 'Obscurica Chen', 'Stephen Chiu', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Timothy Lee', 'Tyler Fionn', 'Arash Markazi', 'Chase Geddes']","The stage is set for the final showdown at the Shanghai Majors with three of the best teams in DOTA 2: Team Secret, Evil Geniuses and Team Liquid.

At this point it's anyone's guess which team will ultimately be crowned the champion, but the edge should definitely go to Team Secret. It is guaranteed into the finals with last night's victory over Team Liquid in the upper bracket finals. One of the other two teams will need to hurdle over the other just for the shot at the title. It has been a wild journey, but Sunday will be its climatic ending.

Team Secret

Tim Franco for ESPN

The odds-on favorite to take down the Shanghai Majors is easily the most well-rounded team of the three and possesses several strong advantages for its claim as the best in this tournament. First, it should be noted that Team Secret already beat both Team Liquid and Evil Geniuses on its way to the grand finals. In both victories, it flashed its world-class rotating abilities and early-game team fighting execution, but also its impeccable defense whenever (it doesn't always happen) EternalEnvy made a crucial mistake. Perhaps the most overstated strength of the team is its supports, Puppey and PieLieDie. They've been the MVPs for Team Secret through amazing warding, rotations and pressure, and their contributions in team fights and individual breathtaking plays. They've simply been the best pair of supports in Shanghai. Editor's Picks Six teams remain in Shanghai, led by Team Liquid and Team Secret Team Liquid and Team Secret face off in the Upper Bracket finals in the Dota 2 Shanghai Major, with Evil Geniuses, compLexity Gaming, MVP Phoenix and Fnatic still fighting in the Lower Bracket.

In its match against Evil Geniuses, Team Secret showcased several strategies that make game planning against them near-impossible. For Game 1, the plan was emphasized around the big team fight with the drafting of an Earth Spirit and Enigma. However, many things went wrong in the beginning -- EternalEnvy's Spectre was near the bottom of the net value for the laning phase, w33's Earth Spirit was in the middle lane with just experience, and only Misery's Lone Druid and Puppey's Enigma farmed. Despite the adversity, Team Secret pulled through and forced several key fights where the combination of Enigma and Earth Spirit were felt. Eventually, the farm of Misery and the power of Spectre took over the game. Team Secret won from a initial deficit. As for Game 3, it was a high-mobility ganking lineup with a focus on vision. Team Secret drafted Night Stalker and Nature's Prophet with the killing potential of Invoker and Ember Spirit. It would harass and punish Evil Geniuses' greedy draft and eventually seize control through the insane vision of Night Stalker.

Those two examples of versatile drafts and the signature ability to recover from mistakes or a deficit, large or small, is what makes Team Secret an absolute threat to take the tournament. Its matches against both Team Liquid and Evil Geniuses were systematic takedowns (more so against Team Liquid), and it should enter the grand finals with confidence.

The key factors: versatile drafts and play styles, PieLieDie and Puppey rotations, and the carry threat of Misery.

Evil Geniuses

Tim Franco for ESPN

The North American hope still remains as arguably the best team left of the three in Shanghai. It possesses two of the greatest carry players, Sumail and Arteezy, the drafting prowess and think tank of ppd, and the overall brilliance of both Universe and Fear's fundamental and efficient play. This is not a team to look past. In its victories, Evil Geniuses looked dominant. It's a claim that none of the other teams have. Whether it was through a lopsided kill score or the structural damage, or even the time played in the game, Evil Geniuses played the part of the overwhelming opponent. If it doesn't forget its strengths of funneling farm through Arteezy and allowing Sumail to pilot a proactive hero, Evil Geniuses could just very well take it all. The biggest key to Evil Geniuses might be speed -- the faster the game or pace, the better for the team. Although it can win and execute well in a longer game, it has been the speedier game that allow for dominant victories. Evil Geniuses' set against compLexity Gaming was a great example. The only loss against compLexity Gaming took 41 minutes in an 18-31 conclusion, but Evil Geniuses' wins were 22:40 minutes and 34:07 minutes, respectively. In those drafts, there were two similarities: Sumail was on a playmaking hero and there was at least one roaming support. If Sumail is denied a hero that can make plays or out-lane the opponent sufficiently, Evil Geniuses will more than likely fall. And, if the team doesn't draft a rotating/gank support like a Vengeful Spirit or a Mirana, the speed of the game will crawl. It's not to say that Evil Geniuses cannot play the long game, it's just that the faster speed of non-stop fighting and rotations favor the North American squad.

Another great example would be its last set against MVP Phoenix. Though speed and frenzied action favored the Korean lineup, it favored the Evil Geniuses more. The drafting of a rotating supporting in Earth Spirit for both games was a game-changer. Not only did you allow the team that needs a rotating support the best one available, but ppd drafted his own signature Crystal Maiden for double the rotating potential. Evil Geniuses fought MVP Phoenix at its game better than any team in the tournament not named Team Liquid. So far, the stars of the Evil Genius squad could be pointed at both ppd (2.6 kills and 11.5 assists per game) and Fear (3.9 kills and 11.6 assists per game). You shut down the rotating potential of Evil Geniuses and it could be lights-out.

The key factors: fast pace and high-execution rotations, tri-core threat of Universe, Sumail, and Arteezy, and individual mechanical skill.

Team Liquid

The team that many were waiting for a breakout performance on a LAN finally emerged. Team Liquid is arguably the team with the most to game plan for. Not only does it employ an older two-core style, but its hero picks sway off the traditional curve. From a support Legion Commander to the lesser-picked Tusk, Team Liquid wants to always be in your face early and often. In addition, its signature drafting style is ""match and defeat"". Team Liquid will allow you to pick heroes that fit your style or strength and then attempt a counter with its own pet picks. Its weaknesses are implied in the style: Team Liquid funnels too much priority into MATUMBAMAN and FATA- and if one is shut down, the team suffers considerably. This is a very fragile ecosystem with cogs that play integral and mostly static positions. The key here is that Team Liquid plays its style so well that it has mostly been indifferent whether you game plan against it or not.

The victory over the Alliance was a great representation of what Team Liquid could do. First, it didn't care about allowing its opponent to select signature and comfort picks -- Team Liquid encouraged it. It simply out-drafted the opponent with heroes that did exactly what Alliance did, but better. Give a Beastmaster, draft a Night Stalker. Allow a Puck to go through and counter with a blink dagger Invoker, and slide the farming Loda a passive Naga Siren so MATUMBAMAN can also farm with his Anti-Mage.

Against Virtus.Pro, Team Liquid gave Silent a Lycan and drafted a Death Prophet and Nature's Prophet. It's a bold anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better statement from the team, and it has worked out so far. As for the two cores? MATUMBAMAN is a star and FATA- has excelled at his secondary carry role. Team Liquids' carry, MATUMBAMAN, is averaging a robust 8.0 kills and 7.6 assists, while FATA- is at 6.3 kills and 9.1 assists per game. That's not to say that its strength is just the two cores; its support system is top-notch in fast rotations and excel in scattered team fights. Whether it's MinDContRol, JerAx or KuroKy, the playmaking starts there. They've been highly involved in every important clash with 10.4, 12.6, and 9.6 assists per game, respectively. It's not the most well-rounded team or strategy, but Team Liquid certainly can outplay and overwhelm any opponent.

Key factors: strong tri-supporting cast, two excellent carry players, and the execution to outplay any draft.

The end of the Shanghai Majors is near and it should be explosive. The winner of the entire tournament will be Team Secret. Its simply playing every team's strategy and employing the Team Secret touch to it. Despite any kind of adversity or mistake, the flawless play of PieLieDie and Puppey more than make up for it. It's too much execution to overcome and this tournament is Team Secret's to lose.",[]

espn.com,2016-02-19 08:18:41+00:00,Molly Huddle Has High Hopes for 2016,"['Published Feb', 'Chris Lotsbom']","(c) 2016 Race Results Weekly, all rights reserved. Used with permission.

NEW YORK  Its been nearly two years since Molly Huddle has lined up on an indoor track, a long 24-month stretch that has seen her rise to world-class levels. Huddle will return to the indoor oval here on Saturday at the NYRR Millrose Games for the womens 5000m. Hinting that she is in very good shape, Huddle would not rule out an attempt on the American indoor record of 14:47.62, which Shalane Flanagan has held since 2009.

Im going to run hard. I definitely want it to hurt, Huddle told Race Results Weekly, speaking quietly at the meet press conference.

Having been training at her warm weather base in Phoenix, Ariz., Huddle has kicked off 2016 with ample motivation. She wants to build on the successes of 2014 and 2015, where she won eleven national titles and set national records at 5000m (14:42.64) and 5K (14:50). Not altering her regimen too much, Huddle is taking a calm approach to the early months of 2016. Along with coach Ray Treacy, the Notre Dame alum knows the ultimate goal is a medal at Augusts Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.

With that being said, she hopes to run well here this weekend and then again at the United Airlines NYC Half on March 20, two dates circled on her calendar. Huddle is the defending champion of the latter event, where she set a U.S. record for an all-womens race, and plans to use the half marathon as a springboard for the rest of the year.

I hope to have a similar build-up this year, and the focus is making the Olympic year and running well there. I probably will keep things similar the front half of the year, and not race as hard as much afterwards, she said.

Saturdays race is not a rust-buster, nor is it strictly a time trial. Huddle has put in a plethora of strength work and built a solid base of training the past few months, running alongside New Balances Emily Sisson and Irelands Mary Cullen. Her weekly mileage has broken into the triple digits twice this year, a high mark for the 2012 Olympian.

[The NYC Half] was a great thing to have on the schedule because it forced me to do a lot of strength work that I can feed off on all year, and it is obviously a great event for me, so I really wanted to come back. We are going to be doing that this year and hoping it pays off again and keeps me strong all year through August, Huddle said. Turning her attention to Saturday, Huddle couldnt help but get subtly excited. Sometimes strength turns into speed when you line up to race, and sometimes you just feel rusty. Well see which one it is!

The current world lead at 5000m is Kim Conleys 15:09.31 (on an over-sized track), which Huddle should break. She said she is capable of a sub-15 clocking, but just how far under 15-minutes is the great unknown (Huddle raised her shoulders at the thought of a particular time). Among those Huddle will be facing Saturday are Emily Infeld, the very athlete who nipped her for the 10,000m bronze medal at last years IAAF World Championships, as well as Kenyas Betsy Saina, New Balances Abbey DAgostino, Nike Oregon Projects Jordan Hasay, Boulder Track Clubs Laura Thweatt, and local standout Marielle Hall (Nike).



Still hesitant to elaborate on last years fourth-place in Beijingfor which she told Race Results Weekly was a devastating result multiple times last fallHuddle seems to be looking ahead.

Im glad I had those races [after Worlds] to look forward to, I think it just helps to focus on the next race and helped me go forward, she said. In her races following the IAAF World Championships, Huddle won national crowns at 5K, 10K, 12K, 10 miles, and 20K.

On The Armorys 200m banked oval, Huddle wants to replicate the tempo and in-the-zone mentality that propelled her to meteoric success in both 2014 and 2015.

I think just because it is 200 meter loops instead of 400m you can kind of get into a zone and click them off especially in the 5000m, which can be a long time to focus, she said.

While intrinsically Huddle is motivated, last weekends U.S. Olympic Marathon Trials served as an added dose of motivation and adrenaline, as she watched former training partner Amy Cragg run away with the womens victory after assisting teammate Shalane Flanagan.

Im inspired by that. I think Amys had a good marathon in her for a while, so for it to come out in those conditions is really impressive. Im glad I wasnt running on that day, but it definitely makes me interested to try the marathon, Huddle said. She wouldnt rule out a fall marathon, and has been anxious to try the distance for many years. Ill definitely be asking all my friends whove run marathons before [for advice]. Hopefully its in the near future.

If the right race plays itself out on Saturday, Huddle could cross the line as the newest American record holder. It could be the beginning of a monumental year for Huddle, a dedicated grinder and feisty competitor.

Its a tall order for the first race in February Huddle began, slightly downplaying her record hopes as not to appear over-confident. [Its] something Id love to have, but the race has to set up.",[]

Courtesy of Jan Guenther In January, Jan Guenther won the Winter Triathlon national championships -- an event that features a 5K run, 15K ride on fat-tire bikes and a 7K cross-country ski course.

Jan Guenther has raced outrigger canoes in California and Hawaii, done a three-day cross-country ski race in Greenland and completed six Ironman triathlons. She has trekked across Finland on skis just for the experience, and paddled in flat-water canoe races across the Midwest. In nearly 30 years of competition she has tackled both the serious (the 1994 Olympic cross-country ski trials) and the odd.

One of those oddities was the Mountain Man Triathlon in Colorado, a now-defunct one-of-a-kind snowshoe-ski-speed skate winter race at more than 7,000 feet. She never won it, but it used to leave her with a smile affixed to her frozen face. It might be her favorite event ever. ""It was just very colorful, very different,"" she says. ""It was fun.""

At 56, Guenther continues to be serious about having competitive fun. The woman for all seasons skis in the winter and runs, cycles, swims and paddles the rest of the year around her home in Long Lake, Minnesota.

In January, she added another experience to her resume by winning the Winter Triathlon national championships in St. Paul, Minnesota, a USA Triathlon event that features a 5K run on snow, 15K ride on fat-tire bikes and a 7K cross-country ski course. She was eighth overall and beat the female runner-up by more than two minutes. She'd never done an event like this, and definitely didn't expect to win.

""I don't necessarily think I have a chance to win anything anymore,"" she says, laughing while citing her age. ""But I did go into it thinking, 'I better stay up with the girls on the fat-tire bike,' only because [the event] was really aimed at triathletes, and triathletes don't ski.""

Once she was on skis, she was in command, saying she felt ""super powerful"" while some other athletes -- relative novices to Nordic -- ""flailed."" She came out of it not only with a victory, but a new interest in fat-tire bike racing, a growing winter sport she calls ""a blast.""

Courtesy of Jan Guenther Jan Guenther's favorite race was the Mountain Man Triathlon -- a snowshoe-ski-speed skate race at more than 7,000 feet in Colorado.

""If I had more time, I would do it,"" she says.

Time is an especially precious commodity for a working athlete such as Guenther. For the past 25 years she has fed her athletic habit while operating Gear West, the sporting goods business she and her husband started in Long Lake -- all while raising their two sons.

She oversees the entire Gear West operation, meaning her hours are long and stretch into the nights and weekends. Retail is always challenging, and she admits it's especially tough in this era when new online operations can disrupt longtime successful ones like hers, which happens to be the largest cross-country ski retailer in the U.S.

""If you're not constantly trying to be better, you sink,"" she says. ""We're probably the best retail shop we've ever been, and it's twice as hard now as it was 20 years ago.""

She knows if she tries to fit in her training during the workday or after hours she'll fail. Something will disrupt her plans. So, she rises early and works out each morning for an hour or two, and gets into work at 10 or 10:30. On the weekends, she'll wedge in a three-hour workout.

Most of her training is done with a group of friends. She'd rather be out running, cycling or skiing than lifting weights in a gym, and she avoids burnout by changing activities and being outside with friends. As she has aged, she has added more gym time to strengthen muscle groups. ""I have to keep parts of me strong enough so long-term aches and pains don't overtake me,"" she says.

To combat three decades' worth of wear and tear from triathlons of all distances, she also gets a special deep-tissue massage with stainless steel tools called the Graston Technique. She says it ""breaks up some of the adhesions"" in her body -- particularly in her back and glutes. She also has tried yoga and can feel its benefits but can't seem to squeeze more into her jam-packed schedule.

""But I think the more restorative activity you can do over 40, probably the better off you are,"" she says.

As an athlete, Guenther seems to have the capacity to push through pain and operate more efficiently than others. ""She could easily have been a pro but she always said she doesn't want to be a pro,"" says her longtime friend Jilly Whiting, who used to train and compete with her. ""She wants to enjoy her life, she wants to have kids, she wants to be a normal person. I remember the first year of the Ironman Wisconsin, I want to say she was third or fourth [woman] overall, so she beat most of the pros there. Phenomenal athlete.""

SkinnySki Jan Guenther qualified to compete in the 1994 U.S. Olympic trials in Nordic skiing.

She was also a late-blooming athlete. Guenther grew up in Chicago and wasn't involved in sports, other than riding horses. She went to Duke and received a degree in psychology, then returned home to get her MBA in finance and marketing at Northwestern.

It wasn't until then that she was introduced to cycling and triathlons. She was an instant convert. At 25 she started Nordic skiing and became very good, eventually qualifying to compete in the Olympic trials at Anchorage, Alaska, in 1994. ""Nordic skiing is something I wish I head learned years earlier, because I liked that more than anything,"" she says.

Her passion for sports changed her life. She abandoned her corporate path and bought a bike shop with friends, married a sales rep for cross-country skis and they opened up Gear West in 1991.

Ever since, she has been training and competing. She has done 10 hours, 24 minutes in an Ironman, and has a best time of 3:07 in the marathon. She once finished as the second woman overall in the American Birkebeiner, the nation's biggest cross-country ski event, and has won several overall and age-group triathlon titles.

Perhaps the biggest challenge has been maintaining a balance in her life among work, family and sports. She knows she has sacrificed some things. Her social life is hanging out with her training partners after a workout, having coffee. She doesn't sweat getting the Christmas cards out on time or worry about housework.

""There's certain things you have to say, 'I don't do that. I can't do that,' "" she says. ""It's not top priority in my life. It's just a trade-off.""

At one recent cross-country race, a woman her age approached her to say she's amazed at what Guenther can do. ""I thanked her, but she probably does a bunch of things that I haven't had time to do.""

Yet she's grateful for what sports have given her.

""It's exciting, it's fun, it's the wonderful people I've met over the years,"" she says. ""I've seen as many places as my time and my ability would allow me to see, and I really wouldn't trade it. There's a lot of times when I think it would have been easier in a normal work world, but when I look back at it, I'm very lucky.""",[]
espn.com,,NHL -Jonathan Drouin has a chance at redemption with Tampa Bay Lightning,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Dan Marrazza', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Sean Allen', 'John Buccigross', 'Sarah Goldstein', 'Scott Burnside', 'Paul Grant']","As much as the preceding weeks have been chock full of drama, vitriol and misinformation when it comes to the story of disgruntled prospect Jonathan Drouin, now is when things get interesting.

The erstwhile Tampa Bay Lightning prodigy who boo-hooed his way off the team and into an unpaid suspension when he refused to report for an American Hockey League game in Toronto on Jan. 20, is now back with the Syracuse Crunch, the Tampa Bay Lightning's top minor league affiliate.

It is a chance for Drouin, 20, to begin rehabilitating his career and reputation, which has been put through the blender in recent weeks.

It won't necessarily be easy, but it doesn't necessarily have to be a trial.

He's a kid. It's a game.

Editor's Picks Drouin suspension lifted, will report to AHL team The Lightning have lifted their suspension of prospect Jonathan Drouin, general manager Steve Yzerman announced Monday, and the former No. 3 overall draft pick will report to AHL Syracuse.

Hot and Not: Ben Bishop and other goalies shining, Tyler Seguin among struggling forwards Ben Bishop has led the Lightning back to the top of their division, while Tyler Seguin's recent skid has coincided with a cold spell for the Stars. 1 Related

And it's a game Drouin has shown, at least in part, to be very, very good at.

We often talk about the building of character for young players, learning how to become not just pro hockey players but professionals in all areas of their life. Surely these past weeks have tested Drouin's character, his resolve and his belief in himself.

And you have to assume this has been a great lesson in humility for Drouin.

Now we will see what he has learned from these lessons.

If he keeps his head down, works hard and plays good hockey for the Crunch, then he will make it much easier for general manager Steve Yzerman to find a trade partner willing to provide the assets that Yzerman requires in order grant Drouin's trade request.

The better Drouin plays, the more comfortable opposing GMs will be in trading value for value.

As we learned through the trade deadline process, Yzerman wants what he wants and refuses to be boxed into a corner. He would not accept a trade that did not suit his needs, his vision of what would make the Lightning better both short-term and big-picture regardless of Drouin's demands.

And then there's this: Yzerman indicated to local reporters Monday that if Drouin plays well, he might even earn a call-up to the big squad. And who couldn't imagine this storyline: Drouin returns during Lightning playoff run to help the Lightning to a Stanley Cup.

Never mind John Scott, Hollywood would be lining up to take a run at that story of redemption.

Of course, if the opposite happens in Syracuse, well, all bets are off, aren't they?

If Drouin mopes about and produces at the rate he did when he was first sent to the AHL in early January when he managed just two goals and one assist in seven games, well, this story may get uglier yet.

Because if we have learned one thing about this showdown between the unproven prospect and the Hall of Fame GM it is that you don't cross swords with the Hall of Famer. Ever.

If Drouin falters, if he does not show the proper humility, the proper work ethic, if he continues to come off as a petulant child who feels he is owed special treatment in spite of a stunning lack of production, then Yzerman will have no problem burying Drouin.

Does anyone believe anything different after all that has unfolded?

That would be a shame, of course.

A waste of a young talent and from the team's perspective, the waste of a terrific asset.

Time will tell and the only person who can tell with any certainty which way this will go, how this final chapter in Drouin's life as a Tampa Bay Lightning is Drouin himself.",[]

espn.com,,Officials looking out for motorised bikes at Track Cycling World Championships,"['Sue Mott', 'One Naci N', 'Gordon Simpson', 'Pa Sport', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Bonnie D', 'Wayne Drehs', 'Espn Staff', 'Johnette Howard', 'Jim Caple']","Two hundred bikes will be tested at this week's Track Cycling World Championships as the UCI steps up the fight over motorised doping.

A bike allegedly containing a motor was confiscated at January's UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships in Belgium and bikes in all disciplines, including track, are being regularly tested by cycling's world governing body.

UCI president Brian Cookson prefers the term ""technological fraud"" to motorised doping, and software has been developed so non-invasive testing can be carried out to identify if a motor might be present within a bike frame.

""At these championships we'll be doing around 200 bikes,"" said Cookson, speaking on Saturday's fourth of five days of competition at the Lee Valley VeloPark in London.

""I'm not saying, 100 per cent, every bike will be tested, but I think you can be assured every medallist here will have had their bike tested.""

Bikes have been scanned by the UCI at major competitions, including the Tour de France, in recent years after rumour and speculation regarding motors hidden in frames.

The UCI has worked with experts to develop software where a device uses magnetic resonance to scan bike frames for any suspicious activity and, if there is a concern, an invasive test can be carried out, where the seat tube removed and a camera inserted inside the frame.

The software means a large number of bikes can be tested quickly, with 100 tested at last month's La Mediterraneenne tour and 140 men's and women's bikes scanned at last weekend's Het Nieuwsblad in Belgium.

Bikes, currently chosen at random, can be tested at any stage.

Cookson added: ""We will be testing before, after and, if necessary, during (races) from time to time. We're looking at the protocol and the rules and how that would apply.

""We will maybe have a commissaire (race official) on a motorbike who will stop with a rider who is changing a bike.

""We'll look for suspicious and intelligence-led solutions, as we are doing in the anti-doping field.

""We have a small anti-doping intelligence testing function, looking at connections between anti-doping agencies' information, from customs, governments, police authorities.

""That approach we're spreading to mechanical, technological fraud as well.""

The first instance of alleged ""technological fraud"" took place during January's Cyclo-cross World Championships at Heusden-Zolder in Belgium in the women's under-23 race, which was won by Great Britain's Evie Richards.

Belgian media outlet Sporza reported that the Belgian Cycling Federation had confirmed that the detained bike belonged to Femke van den Driessche. She denies wrongdoing, but faces a UCI independent disciplinary hearing.

Regulations, recently strengthened, state that a rider is given a minimum suspension of six months and a fine of up to 200,000 Swiss Francs (141,000) for an offence of ""technological fraud"", while coaches, mechanics and other officials could also be sanctioned.

Cookson added: ""The matter has been referred to the disciplinary commission. We expect that to be held within the next month.

""The UCI has requested extremely stiff penalties. The regulation is deliberately quite loosely drawn so the minimum of a six-month suspension would not be appropriate for a motor in a bike.

""Someone using a motor in a bike - that's a very, very serious level of technological fraud and will attract an appropriate penalty.""",[]
espn.com,,Rams prepared to handle loss of Janoris Jenkins,['Nick Wagoner'],"EARTH CITY, Mo. -- Make no mistake, the Los Angeles Rams badly wanted to keep cornerback Janoris Jenkins.

They tried for more than a year to strike a long-term deal with their soon-to-be former No. 1 cornerback, but it was all for naught. According to ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter, Jenkins is headed to the New York Giants on a deal that will pay him more than $12 million per season. The move can't be made official until 4 p.m. ET, when the new league year begins.

Assuming there are no hiccups before that, Jenkins is on his way to play for former Rams coach Steve Spagnuolo, the Giants' defensive coordinator. Really, Jenkins' departure should not surprise. He was always going to go to the highest bidder, and once the Rams put the franchise tag on fellow cornerback Trumaine Johnson, the team's willingness to pay such a heavy freight for Jenkins dwindled.

Back in October, Jenkins said he was looking for a team that would give him a deal that would show the ""respect"" he believed he deserved. League sources told me he would seek a contract that would start at the $10.5 million annual average that the Philadelphia Eagles gave Byron Maxwell last year. The Rams were more comfortable with something in the area of $8 million per year.

In heading to New York, Jenkins takes his knack for big plays -- his six return touchdowns are the most of any defensive player in the NFL in the past four years -- with him. He also takes his penchant for allowing big plays -- Pro Football Focus has him down for 22 touchdowns allowed in that same time span, third most in the NFL.

Jenkins had his best NFL season in 2015, cutting down on some of the mistakes that previously plagued him, and the Rams understandably wanted to bring him back because of it. But if there was one player among their key defensive free agents whom they were equipped to handle losing, it was Jenkins -- not necessarily Jenkins personally, but more so one of their top corners.

Once they tagged Johnson instead, it made Jenkins the most likely candidate to depart. That's not to say the Rams will be able to keep others like ends William Hayes and Eugene Sims and linebacker/safety Mark Barron, but they are right to put the priority on trying to keep those players rather than paying big money for a second corner.

That's because the Rams have some depth in place that makes losing Jenkins more tolerable. Johnson will return as the No. 1 corner, a job he hasn't done much in his four NFL seasons but showed he could handle in a late-season win against the Detroit Lions and receiver Calvin Johnson. Opposite Trumaine Johnson, the Rams are expecting to get E.J. Gaines back in the fold after a season-ending foot injury. Remember, Gaines was actually the favorite to win the starting job instead of Johnson before last season. Assuming he returns to health, which is the expectation, Gaines is capable of stepping in and playing well.

Lamarcus Joyner took a big step forward as the nickel corner and Marcus Roberson is a still-developing talent who can handle the fourth cornerback job. And, of course, the Rams could still turn to the draft to add another topflight corner, especially with three picks in the top 45.

In the meantime, they now have more money they were ready to spend on Jenkins that they can allocate elsewhere. That means continued efforts to keep the likes of Barron, Hayes and Sims and potentially even find some upgrades for an offense in desperate need of some.

No, the Rams didn't want to lose Jenkins just like most teams don't want to lose players they've drafted and developed. But at least in this case, they're prepared to replace him.",[]

Zoro: Takes second place at Gold Series tournament

Name: Hong ""Zoro"" Yije

Team: Team Celestial

Update: Zoro placed second at the Gold Series 2015 Grand Finals, falling to Zhangbo.

Analysis: Zoro had an incredible start to the tournament, topping his portion of the Group Stage event, and advancing to the Round of 16. Here, he had a tough five game series against  but still proved victorious. In the Round of 8, he had a similar fate, winding his way to a critical Game Five matchup against LoveCX. After starting this series down 0-2, he played a slower final three games, winning each of them to secure his spot in the Semifinals. Eager to prove the earlier Playoff matches were flukes, he took a quick series against MagicWind 3-1 with the help of his Warrior, Paladin and Druid decks to advance to the Finals.

Once there, Zoro played well, but not well enough to claim first place. He lost the first game against ZhangBo's Druid, but quickly evened the series in a Warrior mirror matchup. Despite this, ZhangBo was able to take the next game using his Warrior to gain an edge in the series. This pattern continued, with each player trading wins until the final game of the series where Zoro's Paladin was up against ZhangBo's Shaman. Despite getting two extremely early buffed Secretkeepers, Zoro was unable to match the tempo of ZhangBo and was defeated. He finished the Gold Series 2015 Grand Finals in second place.

Dog: Advances to SL i-League Semifinals despite early struggles in Group Stage

Name: David ""Dog"" Caero

Team: Team Liquid

Update: Dog narrowly advanced from the Group Stages, but was able to make a run all the way to the Semifinals of the SL i-League StarSeries Tournament.

Analysis: Dog's tournament start was less than spectacular, narrowly avoiding elimination in the Group Stage.

Moving into the Playoffs, he matched up against Surrender in a best of five series. He quickly went fell behind 1-2 in the series, but was determined to bring it back.

He brought out his Warlock deck, which he lost with in Game Two, and methodically defeated Surrender's Paladin. In the final matchup of the series Dog used the same strategy, this time using his Warrior deck to defeat the Paladin. Moving into the Semifinals, Dog was matched up against Robin who would go on to win the tournament. Despite being up against such a formidable opponent, he was able to take one game in the best of five, and secured his spot as a Semifinalist finisher.

Kolento: Secures Semifinal finish at SL i-League Tournament

Name: Aleksandr ""Kolento"" Malsh

Team: Cloud9

Update: Kolento topped his group to advance to the Semifinals of the SL i-League StarSeries Tournament.

Analysis: Kolento started off the SL i-League Group Stage with an impressive record. In his matches again Cipher, Dog and Nicolas, he went undefeated to earn himself a bye into the Semifinals. Despite this extremely impressive early showing, he was unable to maintain his momentum in the Playoff stage of the event. In his series against Cipher, he quickly claimed the first game in the Paladin mirror match.

From here, the series turned in Cipher's favor, who quickly defeated Kolento's Warlock three games in a row. This eliminated Kolento from the tournament and secured his Semifinal finish in the league.

Cipher: Places second at SL i-League Tournament

Name: Gareth ""Cipher"" Rouse

Team: Fade 2 Karma

Update: Cipher fell to Robin in the SL i-League StarSeries Tournament.

Analysis: The Group Stage portion of the event went poorly for Cipher, who narrowly avoided being eliminated and advanced with an unimpressive 1-2 record. In the Playoffs, he was determined to prove himself and started to do so in a drawn out, five game series against StanCifka. After starting the series with a 2-0 lead, StanCifka brought it back and tied the series bringing it to a deciding Game 5.

Cipher brought out his Secret Paladin to close it out and advance to the Semifinals. He had an impressive showing against Kolento, only falling in the Paladin mirror match and advancing to the Finals with a 3-1 series victory. Despite his success up to the Finals, Cipher failed to take care of business in the championship series, as he was only able to win one game in the best of seven. Robin proved to be too much of a challenge for him and he claimed second place at the tournament.

PurpleDrank wins DreamHack finals

Name: Ryan ""PurpleDrank"" Murphy-Root

Team: Gamers Origin

Update: PurpleDrank defeated Ersee in the finals of DreamHack Winter 2015.

Analysis: The Group Stage portion of the event went well for Purple, who only lost one round to Hoej -- the player that would tie with him at the top of the group. Both advanced from the Group Stage with records of eight wins and one loss. PurpleDrank would use this momentum in the bracket stage of the event, favoring both midrange Druid and Patron Warrior to help him advance. Both of these decks proved to be a struggle for his opponents, as Purple dominated both the Quarterfinals and Semifinals and went undefeated with his Patron Warrior deck. The Finals proved to be a similar experience for Purple, who opted to use only his Druid and Warrior decks, which had proved successful so far in the tournament. This series against Ersee ended similarly to the previous series for Purple, who closed it out 3-1. Purple made the transition from Team Archon's coach and analyst to player recently and brought his strategic knowledge in order to top the tournament. Purple has already started the path to next year's Blizzcon, and he's looking forward to making more progress during his transition from coach to player.

Team: London Conspiracy

Update: Legendaren defeated SuperJJ in the Semifinals of the Truesilver Championship.

With his momentum from the earlier stage of the tournament, Legendaren quickly swept the series 3-0 against Ness to advance to the Semifinals. In the semis, Legendaren would quickly dominate SuperJJ's Rogue to take Game One of the series. In the following game, SuperJJ would react with an aggressive Paladin deck to tie the series 1-1. An extremely long and grueling Game Three would give Legendaren the lead again 2-1, putting him in a position to take the series. While Game Four didn't go the Swedish player's way, Legendaren was able to recompose himself and close out the final game to win the series and advance to the Grand Finals.

Xixo wins WePlay Hearthstone League

Name: Sebastian ""Xixo"" Bentert

Team: Natus Vincere

Update: Xixo defeated MrYagut in the Finals of the Season 1 WePlay Hearthstone League.

Analysis: Xixo started the league well, placing second in the regular season standings, to advance to the Playoff portion of the event. The Semifinals proved to be similar, with Xixo only dropping one game to Ryzen as he stormed his way into the finals of the event. In the Finals, he met Mr.Yagut. Xixo started the series out strong, quickly defeating MrYagut's Druid in just seven turns. Xixo kept his momentum from the win moving into the second game of the series, and defeated Yagut's Patron Warrior before he was able to create a board full of multiplying minions. Mr.Yagut was able to respond by taking the third game as Oil Rogue, but Xixo quickly responded in Game Four shutting it down before he could create any combos, and securing his victory in the league.

Firebat advances to Grand Finals of Gamegune competition

Name: James ""Firebat"" Kostesich

Team: Team Archon

Update: Firebat defeated AKAWonder in the Semifinals of the Gamegune 2015 competition.

Analysis: Firebat dominated the competition in the Group Stage portion of the event, finishing first in his group to move on to the Playoff stage of the event. The Quarterfinals proved to be a bit of a challenge, with a drawn out series going to a fifth game before Firebat was able to advance with a 3-2 series win. Firebat brought his momentum from that win to the Semifinals, where he quickly took the first two games of the series. AKAWonder responded with determination and answered with his own pair of wins in similarly convincing fashion. The final game of the series brought Firebat's Patron Warrior up against AKAWonder's Midrange Mage deck. After a grueling early game, Firebat was able to use a massive Grim Patron, Armorsmith, and Whirlwind combo to fill his board with minions and gain an alarming amount of armor. This move would swing the tempo of the game into Firebat's favor, and AKAWonder would be unable to recover -- allowing Firebat to move to the Grand Finals.

SuperJJ wins SeatStory Cup 4

Name: Jan ""SuperJJ"" Janssen

Team: Complexity HS

Update: SuperJJ dominated the SeatStory Cup 4 with a blowout over StanCifka in the Finals.

Analysis: SuperJJ started the tournament (and the subsequent Playoff stage) with a bit of difficulty, claiming the lowest advancing spot in his group. A similar story was told in the Playoff stage, with both the Quarterfinals and Semifinals taking the full seven games for a SuperJJ victory. SuperJJ was able to win his matchups with his signature Freeze Mage in both of the series'. Moving into the Finals, SuperJJ utilized his Freeze Mage to perfection, claiming a flawless series victory and demolishing each and every deck that StanCifka tried. Despite being counterpicked in several of these games, SuperJJ won with ease and claimed the title of victor.

Ostkaka wins Hearthstone World Championship

Name: Sebastian ""Ostkaka"" Engwall

Team: Natus Vincere

Update: Ostaka beat out 15 other participants to claim his title as the Hearthstone World Champion.

Analysis: Ostaka started off the event strong, topping his group with two nearly flawless victories over both Hotform and LoveCX. He kept the momentum moving into the Quarterfinals, where he had an impressive showing against Pipingho -- dropping only to an aggressive Face Hunter deck. The Semifinals were a bit more of a challenge for Ostaka, who was taken to a fifth game against ThijsNL. After winning the first two games in the series, Ostaka lost two games with his Mage deck -- but then he came back with the same deck to close out the series and advance to the finals. Ostaka started the Grand Finals against Hotform with a convincing win using his Freeze Mage deck, and kept the momentum going to close out the series 3-0.

Xixo defeats Jab to win Arena Invitational

Name: Sebastian ""Xixo"" Bentert

Team: Natus Vincere

Update: Xixo defeated Jab at the eSports Arena Invitational to claim first place.

Analysis: Xixo started strong, advancing as the second seed of his group, along with Jab. Both players would have convincing runs through the bracket stage and they'd meet each other in the finals. In the first game, it was Xixo's midrange Druid against Jab's Face Hunter. Several key draws allowed Jab to come back from a poor start and begin the series with a 1-0 advantage. The third game favored Xixo from the start, with an expertly played Handlock to choke out Jabs' Druid for a quick second win in the series. The final game started with Xixo holding an advantage, facing Jabs' Druid for a third time with insight into what was in store for him. He responded with a standard Patron Warrior deck, one that has proven to be a favorable matchup against Druid and one of Xixo's strongest and most played decks. Xixo played expertly, as he often does, with six Grim Patrons on board by turn five -- which provec fatal to Jab. Jab was forced to surrender on turn seven, giving Xixo the win and first place in the eSports Arena Invitational.

Name: Thijs ""ThijsNL"" Molendijk

Team: G2 Esports

Update: ThijsNL bested Neira in the Finals of the 2015 HWC - Europe Championship in the Road to BlizzCon.

Analysis: Things started off well for Thijs, despite landing in the same group as Ostaka (who would eventually go on to win the World Championship in November). ThijsNL advanced through the Playoff Stage with ease, sweeping Lifecoach by defeating his Control Warrior once with each of his decks. The Finals started slightly differently, with Neirea's Control Warrior proving to be too big of a challenge for Thijs' Patron Warrior. ThijsNL didn't let this phase him, though, and he responded by changing the tempo against Neirea's Druid in the second game; Thijs went on to win the rest of the series without dropping a game, claiming his title as 2015 HWC - Europe Champion.

Analysis: The event started off well for Kranich, despite landing in the same group as Kno -- who he'd meet again in the Finals.

Name: Ryan ""PurpleDrank"" Murphy-Root

Team: Gamers Origin

Update: PurpleDrank bested Hotform in the finals of the 2015 HWC - Americas Championship in the Road to BlizzCon.

Analysis: The event started off well for Purple, who won two of his three matches to secure his spot in the Playoff stage of the event. The semifinals started off well too, with Purple taking a quick win against Nias' Hunter deck to give him the 1-0 advantage in the series.

LoveCX wins 2015 HWC - China Championship

Name: Zhongkai ""LoveCX"" Guo

Team: Yolo Miracle

Update: LoveCX bested Zoro in the Finals of the 2015 HWC - China Championship in the Road to Blizzcon.

Analysis: This event didn't have the best of starts for LoveCX, who barely advanced from his group into the Playoff Stage after playing a tiebreaker match for the final spot in the playoffs. The semifinals proved to be a similar challenge, as NoTomorrow took the first game against LoveCX. LoveXC responded with two quick wins of his own, but he was brought to a fifth and final game after NoTomorrow's Hunter deck proved to be too much. LoveCX played an expert Warlock to win the deciding game and advance to the Finals. Determined to prove that the former portion of the event had been a fluke, LoveCX had an explosive performance in the finals -- quickly sweeping the series 3-0 against Zoro, and claiming his title as the 2015 HWC - China Champion.

Name: Aleksander ""Kolento"" Malsh

Team: Cloud9

Update: Kolento defeated Pavel in the semifinals of the ONOG Summer Circuit Finals to advance to play Tom60229.

He carried this momentum into the semifinals against Pavel, where he grabbed two straight wins to start the series with a 2-0 lead against Pavel's Hunter and Druid decks.

That victory sends Kolento into a Finals matchup against one of his opponents from the Group Stage, Tom60229.

Dog defeats Chakki in the Dreamhack Summer Semifinals

Name: David ""Dog"" Caero

Team: Team Liquid

Update: Dog defeated Chakki in the semifinals of the Dreamhack Summer 2015 competition, using his deadly combination of Warlock, Warrior, and Rogue decks.

Analysis: Dog advanced through seven different rounds of the Swiss group stages -- though he did so with difficulty, claiming one of the lowest seeds moving into the quarterfinals. This portion of the event started off grimly for Dog, but after losing to Hawkeye's Druid Dog was able to find his footing and sweep the rest of the series, moving on to the next round. This momentum proved to be beneficial, as he defeated Chakki's Warrior deck three separate times -- once with each of his three decks. This secured his position as a Grand Finalist at the event, setting the pace for a potential first place finish. The finals started off with an intense matchup against TiddlerCelestial's Druid, who would claim the first victory. The series was not over,however, as Dog would go on to win the next game and then trade wins for the rest of the series. Dog made a critical mistake in the final game by misplaying his Warrior Deck -- and that ultimately cost him a chance at the first place crown. This would secure Dog's position as the second place finisher at Dreamhack Summer 2015.",[]

(2:26)

The Chicago Cubs enter spring training as the consensus favorite to win the World Series, as short as 4-1 at some Las Vegas sportsbooks.

The Cubs are 4-1 to win the World Series at the Westgate SuperBook. No other team has odds in the single digits. The Los Angeles Dodgers and Houston Astros are next at 10-1, followed by the New York Mets and Boston Red Sox at 12-1.

The Cubs opened at 10-1 at the SuperBook and attracted steady action to trim their odds down to 4-1. That's the shortest preseason odds any World Series favorite has had in the last four years at the SuperBook. But it hasn't stopped anyone from betting them.

More bets and more money have been placed on the Cubs than any other team at multiple sportsbooks. It's not really close. Editor's Picks Chalk: Latest futures odds ESPN Chalk presents the latest futures odds from the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook in a variety of sports.

Twice as much money has been bet on the Cubs than any other team at the SuperBook. The San Francisco Giants have attracted the second-most money, followed by the Dodgers.

The MGM has already written more than 2,500 tickets on the Cubs to win the World Series. That's four times as many bets as the next-closest team, the Mets, have attracted and 25 times more than six teams with the fewest bets: The Miami Marlins, San Diego Padres, Tampa Bay Rays, Milwaukee Brewers, Colorado Rockies and Atlanta Braves.

""It's amazing to see how many people are betting the Cubs,"" MGM assistant manager Jeff Stoneback said. ""Every year, there are always a lot of tickets. Now that they're good, you can basically double that. You get the people that are betting them just because they're the Cubs and the people who are betting them because they actually think they're going to win. That's increased the ticket amount.""

The SuperBook opened the Cubs' season win total at 93.5. They are the only team with a season win total in the 90s. The sportsbook at the Atlantis Casino in Reno opened the Cubs' win total at 89 and took enough action on the over to move the number up to 93.

espn.com,,Q&A with WNBA star and author Tamika Catchings,[],"Q&A with WNBA star, Olympian and author Tamika Catchings

Michael Hickey/ Getty Images Tamika Catchings, a three-time Olympic gold medalist and 10-time WNBA All-Star, will enter her 16th and final WNBA season in May.

Indiana Fever forward Tamika Catchings has done it all in basketball. She has won championships at every level, including college, the WNBA and USA Basketball. She has three Olympic gold medals and is expected to pursue a fourth with the U.S. national team in August. Catchings led Indiana to the 2012 WNBA title, and she will conclude her WNBA career this year, after 15 seasons in the league.

Catchings, who moved to the forefront of women's basketball when her Tennessee team won the NCAA title in 1998, has always been known as a relentless competitor on the court -- and an equally dedicated community servant off it. Through her Catch the Stars Foundation, she has impacted the lives of many children, particularly in the greater Indianapolis area.

Chris Bucher Photographs Tamika Catchings' book details stories of her childhood, her struggles with hearing loss and bullying, and how she founded the Catch the Stars Foundation.

Catchings, who recently got married and hopes to start a family as soon as her playing days end, is also known for her advocacy for the hearing impaired, and she is a crusader against bullying.

In her new book, ""Catch A Star: Shining through Adversity to Become a Champion,"" co-written by Ken Petersen, she details her life as the daughter of professional basketball player Harvey Catchings, how she adapted to her hearing impairment as a child, how she sought refuge in sports and how the joys and sorrows molded her into the person she is today. At the recent USA Basketball national team training camp in Storrs, Connecticut, Catchings spoke to espnW about the book and why she wrote it.

Q&A with Catchings:

Q: What was it like to write this book?

A: It has been a three-year process, a lot longer than I would have liked it to be, but it's so rewarding. God's timing is everything, and the book coming out now for my final season -- and everything that will transpire for the next six to eight months -- I'm excited about that.

The journey in writing the book and going through pictures -- unfortunately, I couldn't put in every picture that I wanted to put in -- but the story that we're telling and the people in it, it's just really cool.

Q: Did the writing feel like a journey on which you watched yourself grow up?

A: Yeah, and you remember key moments and being in certain settings and just the feeling of everything you went through, how you felt about the people you shared it with and who were always there for you. People of different ages will read this book and apply it to many things they may be going through.

Q: What are the main things you want them to take away from it?

A: My faith is very important to me, and the book is based on my life through my faith principles. But I think the biggest thing is when I was in school, I had hearing problems, speech problems, I wore hearing aids, and I got bullied when I was young. So I feel like, when I speak to people, I relate to everybody in the room with something I've dealt with. It brings us closer together.

Q: Was that your primary motivation for doing this?

A: Yes. One of the main reasons I wrote the book was so many people would say, ""I wish I could take your message with me, that there was something tangible I could refer to in sharing it with somebody else."" And that's what got me thinking. We already did a kids' book, ""Dreams are for Catching."" Now I want people to go through my journey with me through this book.

I try to be very straightforward and direct in the book. Nowadays, so many kids want stuff given to them. It's not that easy. You have to work for every single thing. Some people look at us, as professional athletes and all the great things we have done, and I'm explaining that this happened because of doing A, B, C, etc., and not just randomly.

Q: When you are a successful athlete, do people, especially kids, see you as ""powerful"" and not think you could have been bullied?

A: Exactly. That's why it's so important to me to also have my Catch the Stars Foundation. Through that, we are able to reach a lot of kids, whether they play sports or not. A lot of them look at me like, ""That happened to you too? It's happening to me now. How did you deal with it?"" The questions that you get after you share your story, that's the most rewarding part of sharing it.

Q: Your book is also a how-to for elite athletes. It explains that they have to keep growing as they reach new levels and challenges. Your alma mater, Tennessee, has been going through some tough times of late, with more losses than the program is used to. What does this book tell athletes facing issues such as that?

A: For everybody who goes through high times, at some point you're going to hit some lows. That's the cycle; it's just how life works. Play with pride, and be grateful for the opportunity and all the things that you get from it. Have pride in your journey, whether you're on top or in the middle or trying to work up from the bottom. You still have to take pride in what you do.""",[]
espn.com,,Chicago Cubs don't need to give Jake Arrieta a long-term deal just yet,"['Jerry Crasnick', 'David Schoenfield', 'Stacey Gotsulias']","Jake Arrieta wants a long-term deal to remain with the Cubs and the sides have talked recently but nothing is close. He does like Chicago but won't be accepting anything shorter than 6-7 years. (0:32)

News out of Chicago Cubs camp: The team is talking about a contract extension with Cy Young Award winner Jake Arrieta. Or maybe the Cubs were talking contract extension:

Sources: Arrieta, cubs had mega extension talks that ended pretty quickly over decent-sized gap over the length of the deal  Jon Heyman (@JonHeyman) March 8, 2016

According to Heyman, Arrieta and agent Scott Boras were seeking a seven-year deal, similar to the length that Cy Young winners Max Scherzer, David Price, Clayton Kershaw, Justin Verlander and Felix Hernandez received in recent seasons.

The Cubs have understandably backed off from the idea. For starters, they have Arrieta under team control for two more seasons. Why give out a long-term deal -- probably in the neighborhood of $180 to $200 million -- when there are two seasons Arrieta could get injured before the free-agent buyout years even kick in?

Beyond that, you can't compare Arrieta to those other aces. Those guys were proven 200-inning workhorses; Arrieta just reached 200 innings for the first time in his career. I'm not saying Arrieta is a fluke: He now has 67 starts with the Cubs with a 2.26 ERA; while it'd be nearly impossible to match what he did in 2015, he's clearly established himself as one of the premier starters in the majors. Still, he has to prove he can deliver dominant 30-start seasons in consecutive years.

Also, due to the strange arc of his career with the years of struggles in Baltimore, Arrieta is already entering his age-30 season. He'll be 32 when he hits free agency. On the other hand, that also means he's pitched fewer innings than those other guys. Here are career major and minor league innings for that group through their age 29-seasons:

Arrieta: 1,303.1

Scherzer: 1,455.1

Price: 1,593

Verlander: 1,672.1

Hernandez: 2,568.2

And, of course, a much lower percentage of those innings for Arrieta have been spent in the majors (795), which are presumably higher-stress innings. Hernandez's totals jump out at you, although keep in mind he was pitching professionally at age 17 when the others were still in high school.

Anyway, that workload -- or lack of it -- could bode well for how Arrieta ages, along with his conditioning regimen.

A secondary issue for the Cubs is being mindful of other players they'll want to sign long-term down the road: Kris Bryant, Addison Russell, Kyle Schwarber & Co. Cubs president Theo Epstein and general manager Jed Hoyer are from the ""build around position players"" camp, so it seems more likely they would want to sign Bryant when he's turning 30 than Arrieta for his age 32-and-beyond seasons -- not that it's either/or. And even if talks have stalled for now, they'll certainly be re-addressed at some point. The Cubs, after all, aren't exactly hurting for money these days.",[]

Eight teams -- Team Canada, Team Czech Republic, Team Finland, Team Russia, Team Sweden, Team USA, Team Europe and Team North America -- will compete in the two-week tournament, featuring more than 150 of the best players in the NHL. All tournament games will be played at Air Canada Centre in Toronto, home of the NHL Toronto Maple Leafs.

All eight teams competing in the World Cup of Hockey 2016 are announcing their rosters of at least 16 players today. The final roster announcement, for Team USA, will be made at 6:45 p.m., ET.

Each of the eight teams will have a tournament roster of 23 players:

20 skaters and three goaltenders. The balance of each teams roster will be announced no later than June 1, 2016.

The World Cup of Hockey 2016 is a joint effort of the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players Association, in cooperation with the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). The eight teams are split into two Groups, Group A and Group B, for the Preliminary Round (Sept. 17-22), when each team will play its three Group opponents in a round-robin format. Placed in Group A are Team Canada, Team Czech Republic and Team USA, plus Team Europe, a pan-European roster of players from birth countries outside of the Czech Republic, Finland, Russia and Sweden. The four teams in Group B are Team Finland, Team Russia, Team Sweden and Team North America, a selection of the top players from Canada and the United States who are 23 or under as of Oct. 1, 2016.

The top two finishers in each of Group A and Group B will advance to the Semifinals (Sept. 24-25), where each qualifier will face an elimination game against a team from the other Group. The two Semifinal winners will meet in the Final, a best-of-three series on Sept. 27, Sept. 29 and, if necessary, Oct. 1.

Live coverage of all tournament games will be provided by Sportsnet and TVA Sports in Canada and ESPN in the United States. A complete broadcast schedule will be announced at a later date.",[]

Adam Schefter breaks down why he thinks QB Brock Osweiler decided to sign with the Texans over the Broncos, as well as what he believes the Broncos plan will be moving forward to fill their void at quarterback. (1:37)

The Houston Texans just took a shot at fixing their quarterback situation by agreeing to a four-year, $72 million deal with Brock Osweiler.

Osweiler was one of the hottest quarterback properties on the free-agent market, which should tell you all you need to know about this year's market. This is a quarterback who was benched for a Peyton Manning who was a shell of his former self.

The Broncos saw the interception-prone, 2015 version of Manning as a better option than Osweiler, which is far from a ringing endorsement, nor is the fact that they bowed out of the race for his signature once the price got too high.",[]

The Panthers, Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, Pittsburgh Steelers and Seattle Seahawks are the five teams tied for the highest projected total of 10.5 wins.

The Super Bowl champion Broncos opened up at 9.5 wins, with the under favored at minus-120, partially reflecting the expectation that Peyton Manning will retire.

The Cleveland Browns (4.5), San Francisco 49ers (5) and Tennessee Titans (5.5) opened with the three lowest win totals. The Browns and 49ers have serious questions at quarterback, while the Titans own the No. 1 pick in the draft and need to restock their roster with talent to support Marcus Mariota.

The team with the highest projected jump is the Dallas Cowboys, which opened at 9 wins. Dallas went 4-12 last season, in an injury-plagued campaign for Tony Romo.

These win totals will likely change a good deal before the season as free agency (March) and the NFL draft (April) shift rosters for all 32 teams.",[]
espn.com,,Defensive concerns abound for U.S.,[],"WASHINGTON -- After struggling mightily to score goals consistently during much of the Jurgen Klinsmann era, it's understandable that much of the talk following the national team's 4-3 triumph over Germany on Sunday centered on the Americans' offensive explosion. If you listened closely to what Klinsmann and his players had to say after the match, though, it's clear that defense remains an even bigger concern heading into the Yanks' three pivotal World Cup qualifiers this month, the first of which is in Jamaica against the Reggae Boyz on Friday.

espn.com,,The characters playing Tecmo Super Bowl keep passion alive despite uncertain future,"['Sheil Kapadia', 'Vaughn Mcclure', 'Tory Barron', 'Mike Reiss', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Adam Teicher', 'Eric Williams', 'Jeff Legwold', 'Jim Trotter', 'Kevin Seifert']","MADISON, Wis. -- Maybe the best ""Tecmo Super Bowl"" player in the United States, and potentially the world, has little to no interest in telling you his real name.

He says, genuinely, it would ruin his life. Most of the other competitors in this 8-bit world know little about him or are not willing to share that information. He's 28 years old. He's from Philadelphia. He goes by ""Joeygats"" -- the kind of name you'd see on an old AOL profile or a makeshift Eagles jersey on Sundays at Lincoln Financial Field.

Last month, Joeygats was at the Badger Bowl, a bowling alley and pub in Madison, the online legend staring at a black-box television on a corner of the stage with a Nintendo Entertainment System controller in his hands. In a match projected to a crowd of hundreds in person and thousands online, he faced a prodigy in the finals of Tecmo Madison -- known as TecmoXII, the largest Tecmo Super Bowl tournament in the country. Joeygats' San Diego Chargers, led by Marion Butts, against 20-year-old Aaron Toner and the Pittsburgh Steelers' defensive duo of Greg Lloyd and Rod Woodson.

Joeygats might be the most prolific ""Tecmo Super Bowl"" player in the country. He said he's played more than 25,000 games online, more than 60,000 hours of gameplay. He's posted roughly 5,100 times on the community's message board, Tecmobowl.org. And he's largely a mystery.

""I don't think no one plays this game more than me,"" Joeygats said. ""They play live or whatever, but I play online like 30 times a day sometimes.

""I've really put in hours.""

He is one of the more controversial ""Tecmo Super Bowl"" players. A competitor in the 256-man tournament, who asked not to be identified, called Joeygats ""the closest thing the Tecmo community has to a villain."" Joeygats plays primarily online. Message board posts mention his potential banishment from some leagues. He's been accused of online cheating in those forums -- claims that have never been proved -- increasing a stigma of online play versus live competition.

He has supporters in the online community. Some have helped pay for his travel to attend three national tournaments in Madison; many think he cannot afford it himself. He can be stand-offish in a group where most players are overly friendly.

He's an emotional player. His face scrunches when he misses a pass, his thin mustache going up almost to the top of his nose. When he blocked a Toner field goal attempt, he let out a scream of excitement. He's focused solely on the screen in front of him. Occasionally he lifts his arm to rub his nose or to hide his controller during play selection.

When he scored what would be the game-winning touchdown over Toner, he nodded his head and said, ""I got it."" After beating Toner, Joeygats shook his hand hard, got up, put his hands on his head and rubbed his black and green Philadelphia Eagles wool cap. He beat Toner -- a software developer who wore a hooded sweatshirt representing his alma mater, Southern Illinois -- 13-10 in the final.

He jumped off the stage to applause and a few hugs. Then Joeygats, wearing a black T-shirt over a gray long-sleeved shirt with a pixelated ""Tecmo Bowl"" helmet on it, smiled. Joeygats dedicated his win to the online community and those who helped him get to Madison, where he is 18-2, the best winning percentage in tournament history. ""This means so much,"" Joeygats said. ""It's so crazy.""

But Joeygats is possibly the last ""Tecmo Super Bowl"" national champion.

Tapping into the past, uncertain about future

""Tecmo Super Bowl"" turns 25 in December. It survived five generations of console development after its 1991 debut, from Nintendo's original system to today's Xbox One and Playstation 4. An innovation in gaming, it is still considered to be one of the best sports games ever. Video game site IGN rated it as the No. 53 Nintendo game of all time, and PC Magazine rated it one of the 10 most influential video games of all time. In 2011, an ESPNRadio bracket voting contest deemed it the best sports video game ever.

Its legacy among sports games was secured because it had then what the Madden series has now: the official NFL license. Lawrence Taylor, Bo Jackson and Randall Cunningham -- known only as ""QB Eagles"" because he was one of three players not to allow his name to be used for the game -- could be controlled virtually at your fingertips. The playbook was deeper than ever. Because all the teams were in the game, gamers could play a full season and ensuing playoffs -- stats tracked, a true champion crowned.

Its quirks helped, too. The most efficient way to run the ball was in a zig-zag motion. Touchbacks on kickoffs did not exist. Fumbles were unpredictable and devastating. Hail Marys were an in-game staple, eliminating 38-year-old Scott Siegel from this year's tournament, leaving him lamenting, ""I should have kept running it"" with Cincinnati despite having quarterback Boomer Esiason.

But even though it has endured 212 decades of gameplay, ""Tecmo Super Bowl"" might finally be on the decline.

Esports are on the rise, and the future of this retro game is unclear. There is interest -- the tournament's video head, Dave Murray, said 5,585 unique visitors watched live on the video streaming service Twitch with 35,542 total views. Unlike thriving esports games, Tecmo's following is in a different age bracket. The majority of competitors are ages 27-40, a time when responsibilities change. Online interest in the game has declined even though live tournament participation has risen.

Matt Knobbe runs Tecmobowl.org and is considered the ""Godfather of Tecmo."" The bearded 38-year-old from Lincoln, Nebraska, said he believes Tecmo online peaked three or four years ago. There's a presence, but to play online, games have to be downloaded. Kyle Miller, frequently Joeygats' opponent online and often considered the best player in the country, quit playing online last year as he saw competition dwindle. He'll now play only live tournaments, a sentiment many shared at TecmoXII.

Toner, in theory, could represent another generation of Tecmo players. But he doesn't think such a resurgence will happen.

""Every tournament I've went to, I've met one or two guys who are 20-22,"" Toner said. ""Outside of that, they are always old guys. I don't see this new wave of Tecmo players coming through or anything.

""The new generation, they aren't into Tecmo. They are into Madden, are into other stuff.""

Live Tecmo is also in flux. On Jan. 4, Tecmo Madison founders Chet and Josh Holzbauer announced this year's tournament would be their last as organizers. TecmoXII moved up two weeks because Chet's wife is due to give birth to their first child, and the original early March weekend was too close to the due date. Josh already has one child. Miller, who was high school football teammates with Cincinnati Bengals tight end Tyler Eifert, missed last year's tournament for the birth of his first child. Some top players once committed to a no-sex-in-June policy -- seriously -- to ensure they wouldn't miss Madison for pending child births.

Not anymore. The game they played as kids is secondary to families they've created with kids of their own.

""I love the game and I still love playing it just as I did at the first one and still get excited about the tournament,"" Chet Holzbauer said. ""But it's a time thing. It's priorities. It's work. It's family.""

The attraction of the game has always been part nostalgia, from the game's rudimentary graphics and easy-to-pick-up gameplay to the players involved. It allowed competitors brief re-entry into their own childhoods. Barry Sanders, John Elway and Ozzie Newsome are long-retired from playing in real life. Elway and Newsome are now Super Bowl-winning executives. Yet Tecmo allowed virtual football resurrection in 8-bit form.

It's no coincidence the Tecmo Madison field was littered with old jerseys from Hall of Famers like Sanders and Warren Moon to Tecmo legends like former Green Bay Packers quarterback Anthony Dilweg and nose tackle Bob Nelson.

""When people hold the controllers in their hand and start looking at the game, it's taking them back to when they were kids,"" Josh Holzbauer said. ""When they were young and 8 years old getting a Nintendo system and a ""Tecmo Super Bowl"" cartridge for Christmas.

""They remember that so fondly. That's part of it, too.""

""Obviously it's legit""

Josh and Chet Holzbauer were roommates in a Madison apartment in 2005, years removed from Tecmo's initial popularity, when a friend's boyfriend invited them to play the game before a night out. It invoked memories of playing their cousins at extended family Christmas parties in Milwaukee. The next day they purchased an NES and ""Tecmo Super Bowl.""

On Feb. 10, 2006, Chet emailed Josh, asking about interest in starting a citywide ""Tecmo Super Bowl"" tournament. Josh responded as many would -- ""I think you have too much time on your hands"" -- before agreeing. They held the first Tecmo Madison, Tecmo I, 15 days later at The Plaza Tavern in downtown Madison. The brothers posted an ad on Madison.com inviting players to the tournament and 22 entrants showed up. One, Peter Kerins, spread news of the tournament online after participating.

Sobhi Youssef showed up at Tecmo II, won and told the Holzbauers about Knobbe's site and the online community. The tournament blossomed from 32 players at Tecmo III in 2007 to the 256-player main draw, not including play-in competitors, in 2016. About 725 players have competed in at least one Tecmo Madison. The tournament was the focus of a 2012 half-hour NFL Films documentary.

Tecmo Madison's popularity can largely be attributed to the Holzbauers. Josh, 34, and Chet, 36, were organized, promoted well and found ways to make the tournament more interesting. Each tournament theme combined a legendary player and pop culture. The 2016 tournament was called ""There's Something About Barry,"" melding Barry Sanders and the 1998 movie ""There's Something About Mary,"" which played on loop throughout the day. Regions were named after ""There's Something About Mary"" actors Ben Stiller, Matt Dillon, Cameron Diaz and, of course, Green Bay Packers quarterback and scene-stealing cameo star Brett Favre.

Every Tecmo Madison tournament has a theme. This one is ""There's Something About Barry,"" melding Barry Sanders and the film ""There's Something About Mary"" along with an 8-bit Nintendo and a ""Tecmo Super Bowl"" cartridge. Michael Rothstein/ESPN

This year's tournament started with a video of real-life Sanders highlights and traditional readings from the unofficial bibles of ""Tecmo Super Bowl"": The Book of LT. The Book of LT consists of two Lawrence Taylor autobiographies -- the Old Testament being ""LT: Living on the Edge"" and the New Testament ""LT: Over The Edge."" Players from North Dakota made trading cards, not of the guys in the game but of Tecmo Madison competitors themselves.

Each game starts with a toss of a gold or silver commemorative coin with Sanders' face on it. The winner of the toss picks which two teams will be used in the game. The loser selects which team he wants to use. Kerins came up with this format for Tecmo VI. There were different rules in early Madison tournaments, but the protocol grew and adapted. In Tecmo IV and Tecmo V, using the 49ers was prohibited. The tournament starts with double-elimination group play to narrow the field to 64, then single-elimination up to the last eight before reverting to double-elimination until a champion triumphs.

The tournament is profitable, too. Badger Bowl general manager Jeff Cummings said TecmoXI in 2015 cleared $30,000, one of his top in-venue days of the year. The Holzbauers created a nostalgic and fun experience for players who drove and flew to Madison to participate for competition and camaraderie.

""Some people have a hard time convincing the wives or girlfriends this is a cool thing,"" said David Thompson, a 34-year-old from Buffalo, New York, who drove 12 hours with four others to play. ""But the thing is, once you come to the tournaments and get the camaraderie going, you realize that this may be on the exterior kind of a dorky thing but then all the guys are awesome and they like it, too.

""So obviously it's legit.""

To help with growing tournament demand, the Holzbauers scoured Craigslist and thrift stores for box televisions -- the game can't be played on high-definition TVs because of lag -- along with Nintendo consoles and cartridges. They asked competitors to help with bringing equipment because they needed at least 32 ""workstations."" Considering the age of these televisions and consoles, it helped to have extras on hand in case something broke. On Friday night the many box televisions sat in Badger Bowl like a technology graveyard, ready to be hooked up at a busted TV's notice.

Jon Bailey keeps the tournament on time. Dave Murray flies up from Tampa, Florida, and helps run the live stream. Wives and girlfriends help with registration. Tony Orenga runs the website, TecmoMadison.com. He also draws the Orenga Posse, a group of 20-25 people who dress up like Luigi and creepy mariachi men and cheer him relentlessly.

Orenga's fiancee, Jamie Morrone, leads the usually-drunken Posse, including props like a $100 lifesize cutout of Orenga in a dog costume and an Orenga Fathead wall decal. Touchdowns at TV No. 10, the Orenga TV, meant Posse chants of ""Jamie and Tony sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G. First comes love, then comes Tecmo, then comes a baby ..."" Morrone's drunken response: ""Heck no."" After Orenga loses in the round of 16, Morrone calls it ""devastating."" Initially skeptical of the entire tournament, she said it became one of her favorite days of the year.

""It's a spectacle,"" Morrone said. ""But it's actually fun to be a part of.""

""One more year""

Chants of ""one more year"" sprung up whenever Chet or Josh Holzbauer spoke. There is hope another national tournament emerges, and regional competitions in Ohio, Iowa, Indiana, New York City and Green Bay, Wisconsin, are possibilities to take over. But the commitment -- the Holzbauers estimated hundreds of hours of work, about 10-15 a week -- is daunting, and Madison's tournament size more than quadruples the next-largest competition.

As Joeygats celebrated his win, Chet and Josh searched the crowd for perennial players. This would be the end. The Holzbauers signed autographs on T-shirts and posed for pictures. Half the competitors in the tournament are new each year for various reasons, but the remaining regulars have become a family, a major part of the Holzbauers' lives.

The day after the tournament, most participants drove or flew home. In many ways, it signaled an end of holding onto youth, an end of the first half of many of their lives and an end to more than a decade's worth of friendships forged over a video game created 25 years ago -- one with an uncertain future.

""It's the realization that a lot of these guys I'm never going to see again,"" Knobbe said. ""I'd like to think I'll see Chet and Josh again, but this might be the last time I see Chet and Josh. It might be the last time I see Jon [Bailey].

""They'll always be tournaments and whether or not there's 256 people or 24 people, that's just a little bit of scale. At the end of the day, it's still a Tecmo tournament.""",[]
espn.com,,NHL exploring possibility of raising draft age to 19,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Scott Burnside', 'Paul Grant']","As the NHL is set to celebrate its centennial season in 2016-17, there's an initiative to explore ways to improve the game, including the possibility of increasing the draft age to 19.

The current draft age is 18. There has been an influx of talented players to make their NHL debuts at that age, and many of those players do not want to see it changed. Current Edmonton Oilers assistant captain Taylor Hall was the No. 1 overall pick in the 2010 NHL entry draft and began his pro career at 18. Hall, 24, doesn't think the age requirement should be increased to 19.

""No. I think it's fine where it's at,"" he said. ""You're seeing kids come in and do great things in this game. When you're 18 you should be able to work and seek employment however you want, so I think it's fair.""",[]
espn.com,,Dancer who lost leg in Boston Marathon bombings plans to run race,"['Andrew Hood', 'Greg Garber', 'Rico Longoria', 'Roger Robinson', 'Velonews Com', 'Competitor Com', 'Mario Fraioli', 'Caley Fretz', 'Sarah Gearhart', 'Doug Williams']","BOSTON -- A professional ballroom dancer who lost a leg in the Boston Marathon bombings says she's training to run this year's race: all 26.2 miles of it.

Adrianne Haslet-Davis said in an interview aired Tuesday on the Hallmark Channel that she'll run to help raise money and awareness for Limbs for Life, an Oklahoma City-based organization that provides prostheses to low-income amputees who can't afford an artificial limb.

Haslet-Davis, 35, lost her left leg below the knee in the April 2013 attacks, which killed three people and wounded more than 260 others.

She said she's up to 10 miles in training, using a carbon-fiber blade to help fulfill a promise she made to herself after the attacks to complete the marathon.

""I'm really excited and slightly terrified,"" she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.

In 2014, during the first running of the marathon after the bombings, she ran the last few blocks of the course with her brothers. Last spring, wearing a long flowing gown and heels, she and a partner danced a foxtrot across the finish line.

""Back in 2013, I vowed to dance again and made a pledge to run the Boston Marathon. I've since danced, and on April 18, 2016, I will make good on that promise,"" she said.

""I knew it would be powerful if I were able to do that -- not only for myself but for other amputees who are saying, 'I can't do this or that.'""

The Boston Marathon's 120th running will be held April 18.

Haslet-Davis was near the finish line, cheering for the runners, when the second of the two bombs exploded.

In some of the rawest testimony heard during last year's federal trial of admitted bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted and sentenced to death for his role in the attacks, she recalled hugging her husband tightly after the first bomb went off down the street and saying: ""The next one's gonna hit, the next one's gonna hit.""

The next thing she knew, she was on the ground, her leg shredded and bleeding heavily.

Since then, she has resumed her pro dancing career and has been traveling the country as an event speaker.

Running? Not so much. Haslet-Davis admits she could dance for hours but ""couldn't run a block"" until she recently started training seriously.

Shelley Dutton, development director for Limbs for Life, said the foundation is grateful for the visibility and awareness Haslet-Davis' run will provide.

""For her to be able to do this three years after the loss of her leg is exceptional,"" she said Wednesday. ""It's a tremendous road back. She's reached some incredible milestones.""",[]
espn.com,,Splitting Corey Perry and Ryan Getzlaf is a hit,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Courtesy Of The Nhl', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Paul Grant']","One of the prominent story lines for the Anaheim Ducks this season has been something few people ever thought would happen: Corey Perry and Ryan Getzlaf playing on different lines.

I remember at training camp when I dropped into Anaheim for a few days, Ducks head coach Bruce Boudreau mentioned the possibility, to which I thought: ""That will last two games at most.""

Well I was wrong. Perry and Getzlaf have played on different lines most of the season -- and when you add in a third line centered by Ryan Kesler that has had a lot of success -- the Ducks are coming at you in three offensive units, which simply was never the case in seasons past.

""I was just as surprised as you were when I heard that (at camp), because since Ive been here those two have been inseparable, not just on the ice but they do a lot of things off the ice, too,"" Ducks blueliner Cam Fowler said of splitting up Getzlaf and Perry. ""So it was kind of weird to see them split up on the ice. But I think its done huge things for our team.

""It has spread our scoring out. Its given us more scoring depth that teams have to be aware of now. We have four really solid lines now, and people on all those lines that can score at any given moment. It gives other people something to think about where as in previous years they could stack their lineup against the Getzlaf line and, if you shut those guys down, you might have had a good chance. It brings a different dynamic for us this year with those two being split up.""",[]

espn.com,,"Los Angeles Rams keep Mark Barron, William Hayes in fold","['Michael Rothstein', 'Ben Goessling', 'Josh Weinfuss']","The Los Angeles Rams lost two key pieces of their defense on Wednesday but were able to retain two as well.

After losing cornerback Janoris Jenkins and safety Rodney McLeod to the Giants and Eagles, respectively, the Rams agreed to contracts with safety/linebacker Mark Barron and defensive end William Hayes.

Barron agreed to a five-year, $45 million deal to remain with the team, a source told ESPN's Ed Werder, and Hayes agreed to a three-year deal worth $21 million maximum, a source told ESPN's Josina Anderson.

Barron, 26, was a breakout star for the Rams in 2015, especially after he replaced injured linebacker Alec Ogletree on the weak side.

Officially, the Rams listed Barron as a weakside safety, but he found ways to be productive at safety and linebacker, finishing the season with 113 tackles, a sack, three forced fumbles and four pass breakups.

Barron's versatility has offered the league a glimpse of a new breed of player -- the former 'tweener turned safety turned linebacker. Deone Bucannon of the Arizona Cardinals plays a similar role.

After the season, Rams coach Jeff Fisher said the team ""desperately"" wanted Barron back in the fold and insisted it would have room for Barron even after Ogletree returned.

Mark Barron finished last season with 113 tackles, a sack, three forced fumbles and four pass breakups as he contributed from both the safety and weakside linebacker positions for the Rams. Michael Thomas/Getty Images)

The Rams acquired Barron via trade midway through the 2014 season, and he played 166 snaps in nine games after his arrival. It wasn't enough to persuade the Rams to pay the costly freight of the one-year deal that goes with exercising the fifth-year option the team had on him before last season.

Hayes, 30, has been the Rams' resident merry prankster in his four years with the team but also a key contributor to the team's defensive line rotation.

Although Hayes was signed mostly to add depth, he's become a de facto starter the past two seasons, as end Chris Long has missed chunks of both years because of injury.

Hayes had 53 tackles, 5.5 sacks and two forced fumbles in 2015 and has posted 21.5 sacks in four seasons with the Rams.

Originally a fourth-round pick of the Tennessee Titans in 2008, Hayes has had a long-standing relationship with Rams coach Jeff Fisher, and it left Hayes saying after the season that he wanted to keep playing for Fisher.

espn.com,,Vincenzo Nibali would take teammates with him in Astana exit,"['Andrew Hood', 'Sarah Gearhart', 'Competitor Com', 'Gregor Brown', 'Rico Longoria', 'Phil Gaimon', 'Roger Robinson', 'Doug Williams', 'Pa Sport', 'Mario Fraioli']","Editor's note: This article originally appeared at VeloNews.com.

MUSCAT, Oman (VN) -- 2014 Tour de France winner Vincenzo Nibali needs his group of helpers regardless of which team he rides for in 2017. The Italian says that whether he stays with team Astana or jumps ship, perhaps to Trek-Segafredo, he wants his allies close.

The 31-year-old has won all three grand tours, and last year in the Tour de France he placed fourth overall and took victory in the La Toussuire stage. This year, he will aim for a second Giro d'Italia title and a gold medal at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Next year remains an unknown, but he will decide on a team sometime soon.

""Let's say that at this point, my manager, Alex Carera, is taking care of everything,"" Nibali told press at the Tour of Oman this week. ""There have been some important contacts, as the Italian press like Gazzetta has picked up on, and I can't say any more than that.""

Nibali leaned forward in his chair next to the hotel's fountain. He sat alone, but talked about the riders and staff that help him in the big races.

""It's clear that you need to take everything into consideration. I know the other teams well, and I know the value of Astana,"" he said. ""At Astana, there's a group who works with me, so it's important that the group stays with me. That's my thinking, at least. I'd like to keep them close. It's not just about Vincenzo Nibali, but about the group around him.""

Unlike Richie Porte, who joined BMC Racing this winter without any of his former Sky teammates, Nibali wants to take one or two teammates, a masseur, and a trainer. It would be similar to when Alberto Contador joined Saxo Bank for 2011, taking along Daniel Navarro, Jesus Hernandez, and Benjamin Noval. It is VeloNews' understanding that Nibali would take Alessandro Vanotti, Valerio Agnoli, masseur Michele Pallini, and trainer Paolo Slongo.

The break could happen, even if Nibali did help the Astana team win the Giro and Tour over the last three years. The Sicilian has butted heads with general manager Alexander Vinokourov over his fitness, his helpers, and the team's doping cases. Though Vinokourov gave a 99 percent chance late last year that Nibali would stay with Astana, it appears Trek-Segafredo's, and perhaps Lampre-Merida's, pull could be too much to resist.

Joe Vadeboncoeur, Trek's VP of product development, marketing, and creative design, told VeloNews the team now has money to court a grand tour winner thanks to coffee giant Segafredo joining as co-sponsor over the winter. Given Segafredo's base in Italy, it makes sense for the team to woo Nibali. General manager Luca Guercilena said Trek is interested in Nibali, but it must negotiate and outbid other teams. Before making any decision, however, Nibali will first consider his group.

""Last year there were some misunderstandings. We were trying to build the group in a certain direction and maybe it wasn't easy. There maybe wasn't the right feeling, especially during the first week [of the Tour],"" Nibali said.

""I guard my teammates with jealousy because we're a good group, they're people I care about. We're a group of friends. At this moment, it's clear that I'm feeling good, I've started well. With the group around me, we've raced the Tour de San Luis, then a good training camp at Teide [Spain] and now we're here.""

Here in Oman, the cyclist who Italians refer to as ""the Shark of Messina"" already appears hungry. He broke free with 16 riders, including stage winner Bob Jungels of Etixx-Quick-Step, on Tuesday. In Wednesday's stage 2, he placed second behind Edvald Boasson Hagen of Dimension Data on the short and rapid uphill finish.

""I was just overcome by emotion,"" said Counter Logic Gaming's top laner, Darshan ""Darshan"" Upadhyaha, to ESPN following CLG's win over the previously undefeated Immortals (12-1). ""There was a [moment in the game] when I went unfocused for a second, and then I quickly refocused myself and stayed [that way] for the rest of the game. As soon as [we] won, the thoughts went out of my head and I was just happy.""

CLG (9-4), the reigning champion of North America, has been overlooked for most of the season up to this point. With the loss of starters Yiliang ""Doublelift"" Peng and Eugene ""Pobelter"" Park, the kings of the NA LCS appeared more like challengers than defenders of the crown. The squad has improved each week it has come to the LCS studios, rising higher in the rankings as its begins to resemble the organization that hoisted the trophy last split in New York City.

Just kidding, they're still #1. 2 Related ""We just have a really good method of constantly analyzing what our weaknesses are,"" Upadhyaha said, reflecting on his team's steady improvement from week to week. ""Not just game-related, but relationship-wise -- what are we doing to get up and have a productive day. How are we starting our days? Are we going to the gym? Are we eating right? Everything is important. We look at all those factors and constantly try to improve them...I think we have that edge on a lot of competitors.""

2016 has been a breakout season for CLG's top laner. Always hyped up, and seen as one of the future stars of North America, the now-21-year-old ace has become one of the premier faces of the league. His constant split pushing and pressure around Summoner's Rift has made him an extremely dangerous player at all times. Even when he's down in kills to his lane opponent, and struggling for gold, he has the ability to open up the map with his sustained harassment.

Darshan, however, doesn't focus on his own efforts; he credits his team for the opportunities he's given on the map.

""I think a lot of my split pushing and pressure is thanks to what my teammates do,"" he said. ""People will look at players like [Heo ""Huni"" Seung-hoon] and say this guy is a monster, but what [they] don't realize is how much pressure [Kim ""Reignover"" Yeu-jin] puts up for Huni in the top lane. When I do well in games, it's not like I [did it] solo...If you look at our game against Immortals, [Jake ""Xmithie"" Puchero] got me ahead, our four-man [grouping] played really well and stopped recalls, and then Xmithie stole a Baron. All these things happened that helped me do really well in the game.

""This split, the team has gotten better at working around me than anything, and it's really allowed me to shine.""

One of the main reasons why CLG has done so well in this rebuilding split is its jungler, Xmithie. Darshan remarked on how his growth has helped the team this season, as communication and synergy have become one of the biggest strengths of Counter Logic. Whenever Darshan needs help, his partner in the jungle is there to support him, and vice versa. In 2016, when a lot of games are won and lost by how well the top laner and jungler play together as a duo, CLG believes it has one of the best pairings in the entire league.

""I think everyone is willing to adapt,"" Darshan answered when asked for one advantage that the current CLG has over the championship squad of 2015. ""I feel like people aren't stuck on 'there's one way to play the game.' People aren't stuck on, 'There's one champion I have to play.' ... People are open-minded, willing to adapt, and I think that helps a lot.""

CLG's next stop, after its game Sunday against Cloud9 (9-4) -- the team it's battling for the second place and a bye in the playoffs -- will be the IEM World Championships in Katowice, Poland. Their first match will be against the defending Summoner's Cup winners and the team Darshan is excited to play the most -- SK Telecom T1.

""I've never had an opportunity to play against them,"" he said about the two-time world champions. ""They've always been heralded as the best team, with [Lee ""Faker"" Sang-hyeok], who's seen as the best player in the world. And while they're not doing so well right now, it's just playing against Faker and [the rest of T1] would just be awesome.""

So how far does CLG's split-pushing star see his team going this year at IEM, and possibly the world championships this fall?

""Well, I always want to be improving,"" he said. ""Every scrim matchup. Every LCS game. Even if we lose, I want to be learning and improving from that. But my goal has always been to be the best player, to be the best team. It doesn't matter if it's IEM next week or the world championship -- I'm aiming for nothing less than first.""",[]

espn.com,,Sloane Stephens taking advantage of opportunities,"['Peter Bodo', 'Pa Sport', 'Mark Hodgkinson', 'Espn Staff']","If Sloane Stephens and Sam Querrey have been looking for the right time to shed their frustrations and launch a strong run to reprise their past success, there may be no better time than the present.

Indian Wells and Miami, the back-to-back U.S. combined hard-court events, are less than two weeks out. And the WTA and ATP form charts are less clear than they have been in years.

On the women's side, Serena Williams hasn't played a competitive match since she lost the Australian Open final to Angelique Kerber. Maria Sharapova, always dangerous at the upcoming major events, has slipped to No. 7 and hasn't played either. Simona Halep and Victoria Azarenka are physically compromised. Petra Kvitova is floundering, and Kerber lost the only match she's played since her breakthrough win.

Sloane Stephens already has two titles in 2016. AP Photo

The ATP is hardly better off. Rafael Nadal continues to struggle, while Roger Federer has withdrawn from Indian Wells while he recuperates from minor knee surgery. Further, Andy Murray will be coming off paternity leave, and top-ranked Novak Djokovic had to pull out of his last tournament (Dubai) with a painful eye infection.

Stephens, who has been ranked as high as No. 11, and former No. 17 Querrey can't ask for a better opportunity than the one awaiting them in March and April.

Stephens won her second title of 2016 last week in Acapulco, and Querrey recently ran the table at Delray Beach, then backed it up with a semifinal in Acapulco. Querrey might have been speaking for Stephens as well as himself after he upset No. 2 seed Kei Nishikori early last week in Acapulco.

""Sport is kind of all about momentum; the more you win, the better you feel, and that's kind of where I'm at right now,"" Querrey said to the press.

It's a good place to be for the injury-plagued 28-year-old. Stephens may be in a similar sweet spot after she once again raised expectations when she kicked off the new year with a title run in Brisbane -- then promptly shattered hopes with a lethargic 6-3, 6-3 loss to Chinese qualifier Qiang Wang at the Australian Open.

Stephens raced to a 3-1 lead in that match, then lost 10 straight games -- along with her enthusiasm and focus. ""I felt fine,"" she insisted afterward. ""It just kind of got away from me.""

It wasn't the first time Stephens fell into a mental fog and allowed a match to slip away. Nor has Querrey, who's also frequently described as ""laid-back,"" been immune to flagging spirits and a comparable loss of verve. Querrey lost in the final of the grass-court ATP 250 in Nottingham last June, then failed to win consecutive matches for the rest of the year. He finished with a losing record for 2015, 20-24.

It's impossible to say just what it takes to jump-start the A-game of either of these players, but the engines seem to be running. And the success of their countrymen might prove to be a useful motivational tool -- Stephens and Querrey were not the only Americans who had a good February.

Taylor Fritz, 18, who made the semifinals in Memphis, is now the youngest player in the top 100. Tim Smyczek, Donald Young and Rajeev Ram -- a loser to Querrey in the Delray final -- also have played well in February.

Among the women, Venus Williams won in Taiwan. Coco Vandeweghe and Madison Brengle, who upset Kvitova, made the quarterfinals in Dubai. Christina McHale fought her way to the semis of Acapulco, and Shelby Rogers made the final in Rio.

Back in January, after Stephens lost in an upset at the first major of the year, she said, ""I'm disappointed that I lost here, but if I play until I'm 35, I have plenty more Grand Slams to go. So I just have to look past it.""

Stephens is just 23. She can afford to be flip about a loss. But as Querrey can attest, the years slip by quickly and opportunities like the ones they both have in the coming days shouldn't be wasted.",[]

The Chicago Bears continue to remodel their defense, and they moved in the right direction with the signing of Danny Trevathan from the Denver Broncos.

Chicago had solid production out of its outside linebackers last season with both Pernell McPhee and Willie Young earning strong grades and combining for 114 total pressures. The Bears also saw a lot of promise out of rookie Eddie Goldman on the D-line, but the problem spots were at inside linebacker, where Christian Jones and Shea McClellin were both poor, especially against the run.

Entering the tournament, the storyline was one of disarray. The only region sending their regular season's top two teams, China, was coming off catastrophic results at the Riot World Championships and preseason Intel Extreme Masters events. The reigning Summoner's Cup holders, SK Telecom T1, boarded their plane to Poland with a myriad of issues plaguing them in their domestic league.

But as the staff and crew tear down the grand finals stage at the Spodek Arena, there was no confusion about who the best team in the tournament was -- the world champions were simply a class (or two) above the rest of the field. Even with their roster changes and early-game difficulties in South Korea's League of Legends Champions Korea, the current sixth-ranked team in the competition showed little trouble dispatching their opponents in Katowice.

At the center of any T1 championship victory is Lee ""Faker"" Sang-hyeok, the team's longtime ace and face of the SKT organization. The IEM Katowice win has brought up Faker's all-time major trophy total to eight, with the IEM World Championship looking quite nice next to his two Summoner's Cup triumphs, four domestic titles, and trophy from All-Stars Paris in 2014. The leading man in the world of competitive League, T1's undefeated run in Poland will only add to his already legendary status in the pantheon of esports all-time greats.

And while Faker was an important part to T1's conquest, it was the shy, soft-speaking AD carry in the bottom lane who was the true MVP of the tournament. Bae ""Bang"" Jun-sik has been an important cog in the machine of SKT over the past two years, fulfilling the role of a safe, dependable carry alongside his support partner Lee ""Wolf"" Jae-wan. While having stellar carry performances on agile marksmen like Lucian and Kalista in 2015 on the Summoner's Cup-winning squad, he was primarily seen as the sidekick next to Faker and T1's top laner in Jang ""MaRin"" Gyeong-Hwan.

Bang's role has changed ever since the calendar flipped to 2016, being put into more of the ace role of the team as Faker has been happy to play more supportive champions like Lulu to back him up. T1's AD carry has consistently been one of the top players in Korean solo queue, and his mechanics have been fully put on display in his new role as the hard carry on the revamped T1. The fleet of foot sniper exited the tournament with an outrageous KDA of 19.6, racking up 43 kills in seven games and only dying five times.

Comparing the 2015 team and the one of today, the biggest change outside their shifting of preference to the bottom lane is their early-game troubles. SK Telecom T1 of 2016 plays a lot more like the GE Tigers of spring 2015 than the T1 squad who dissected everyone systematically last summer. Like the GE Tigers (who actually lost in the semis of last year's IEM Katowice), they play a lot around their AD carry and have a lackluster first 15-to-20 minutes of the game.

Last year around this time, I said the the GE Tigers had a switch they flipped around the first contested dragon of the game at the 15 or 20 minute mark. The team, who routinely faced an even or disadvantageous gold total, would seemingly wake up near the river next to the dragon, pick up a few kills through a won teamfight or pick off, and then ride that success to a quick succession of objectives and other kills.

Current T1 have the same sort of switch when the laning phase is dying down and it becomes more of a skirmishing, fluid map movement-type of game. They'll come alive through a pick off of an opponent, a quick dragon or Baron Nashor, and then be up 7k gold when they were tied with their opponents 90 seconds earlier.

The elephant in the room that needs to be addressed after this tournament is how much stronger the current LCK is compared to the other leagues. China is having a down season as seen by their two teams failing to make the finals. Europe and North America didn't send their best team, but neither did South Korea. Taiwan might be better than they were in 2015, yet we can't say that for sure until we see their champion, most likely AHQ E-Sports Club, at the Mid-Season Invitational in Shanghai.

Helena Kristiansson/ESL

South Korea is as strong as they've ever been as a league. Alongside SK Telecom T1, there are seven other teams in the region who range from good like the better-than-their-record-suggests Afreeca Freecs to the unstoppable ROX Tigers. SK Telecom T1, while playing better than they have in some matches on their home turf, were still a team with issues in the early-game despite their perfect record, and they were playing with a rookie jungler in Kang ""Blank"" Sun-gu. The amateur turn pro certainly experienced a great first international tournament, but even he started slow in the first few games he played at the event.

In the LCK, these small deficits and sometimes needless kills T1 gave up in Katowice are turned into insurmountable holes they can't dig themselves out of. When Faker on Zed was having a disappointing start of the game against Team SoloMid in the semifinals, it was alright. The team was able to flip their mid-game switch, delete a split-pushing Yiliang ""Doublelift"" Peng on the topside of the map, and turn around their melancholy beginning in a matter of seconds. If Faker has a so-so start in one of T1's games in the LCK, they get punished for it and lose a large majority of the time.

The undefeated, in-your-face ROX Tigers. The dragon tamers of KT Rolster. The grit and grinder philosophy of the Jin Air Green Wings. The surprising Samsung Galaxy. The talented and money-infused 10-man roster of Longzhu Gaming. The youth movement at CJ Entus shepherd by multiple all-star veteran Hong ""MadLife"" Min-gi. And even the Afreeca Freecs, who are 3-6 overall on the season, are one of the best early-game teams in Korea and have taken games off the best teams in the league, including a match win over T1.

South Korea has rebuilt themselves from the ground up after other regions, primarily China, signed a majority of their star players in the offseason between the 2014 and 2015 seasons. The players who stayed with their teams have grown into battle-scarred cores of their team, and amateur players have come up through the pipeline to give the region a bright future for years to come.

So, yes, SK Telecom T1 will leave Europe with a trophy in hand. The conquerors of the IEM World Championships. The flawless team who forced their final opponents, Fnatic, to surrender in the last game of the tournament. The team that now holds both the Riot world championship title and the IEM world championship title.

However, when they land back in their comfortable home of South Korea, it'll be back to business. While SKT T1 were in Poland winning the championship, the teams in the LCK were continuing their practice and work to make sure they're the ones to raise the trophy at the end of the split and deny T1 their three-peat aspirations.

The two groups -- the National Council on Problem Gambling and the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood -- said in letters Wednesday that the NFL ""aggressively marketed"" a fantasy sports game on ""NFL Rush,"" its website and smartphone app for children, as well as on SIkids.com, Sports Illustrated's website for children, and through an elementary school curriculum based on the contest.

The weekly ""NFL Rush Fantasy"" games ran throughout the football season and were open to children ages 6 to 12. Each week, an Xbox One console and Madden NFL 2016 video game was awarded to the contest's top performer.

The two contest participants with the highest number of points at the end of the 17-week promotion also won a $5,000 check -- which the league called a ""scholarship"" -- plus a four-night trip to Hawaii to attend the Jan. 31 Pro Bowl game with up to two guests.

Like typical fantasy sports contests, the games required the young players to pick teams of real life athletes in order to rack up ""fantasy"" points based on how well those athletes did in games.

Keith Whyte, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based National Council on Problem Gambling, wrote in his letter to Goodell that the contests ""may encourage children to spend excessive amounts of time trying to win these prizes, thus planting the seeds of addiction.""

Josh Golin, executive director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a Boston-based group that opposes child-targeted marketing, called the league's fantasy sports-based curriculum ""particularly egregious.""

""NFL Rush Fantasy--Learn, Play, Score!"" was a math and language arts program that required students to sign up for the NFL's fantasy football game in order to access lesson materials and complete assignments.

""Educators should not be called upon to assist the NFL in promoting an activity which is potentially harmful and addictive when engaged in by children,"" Golin wrote to Goodell.

NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy, in response to questions from The Associated Press, said the curriculum initiative ended after the 2014 season. He declined to provide further details.

Of concerns about the contest, McCarthy said parents had to provide consent before their children could play the games.

He also maintained that the contest, which just completed its seventh year, is more like the free, season-long fantasy sports games familiar to many Americans than the daily versions that have increasingly come under scrutiny from some policymakers as illegal sports betting operations.

""Whether or not it constitutes daily fantasy sports, there is the bigger issue that it indoctrinates young children into a potentially harmful and addictive behavior,"" David Monahan, of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, responded.

In its five-page letter to Goodell, the campaign also suggested the contest's parental consent was easy to circumvent.

The NFL asked each child to provide an email address of a parent or guardian so it could send them a form to verify their child's age and permission to play for prizes.

McCarthy didn't address the campaign's concern and declined to provide details about how many children participated in the contest. Instead, he noted that parents also had the option to let their child play without a chance for a prize.

espn.com,,What will the Seahawks' plan be for replacing Bruce Irvin?,['Sheil Kapadia'],"Seattle Seahawks linebacker Bruce Irvin deciding to leave will not surprise head coach Pete Carroll or general manager John Schneider.

Schneider acknowledged the strong possibility last month at the scouting combine. And on Tuesday evening, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that Irvin is expected to sign with the Oakland Raiders when the new league year begins Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET.

The Seahawks knew that Bruce Irvin might leave in free agency, and now they'll have to move on Plan B. AP Photo/Stephen Brashear

Now the Seahawks need to come up with a replacement, and that won't be easy. Irvin played 71.4 percent of the Seahawks' snaps last year and served a versatile role, playing outside linebacker in the team's base look and moving to right defensive end in nickel. On passing downs, he rushed the quarterback 69.5 percent of the time and dropped into coverage on 30.5 percent of the plays, according to ESPN Stats & Information.

The truth is the Seahawks might need to use multiple players to fill Irvin's role if they can't find one who's versatile enough. When Irvin sat out a Week 11 game last year because of an injury, Mike Morgan started at outside linebacker, but he played only 42 percent of the snaps. The Seahawks replaced him with a better pass-rusher in their sub packages.

That could be the formula in 2016.

There are some intriguing potential replacements on the free-agent market. Nick Perry of the Green Bay Packers could certainly play right defensive end in the Seahawks' sub packages. He's a fantastic athlete and played for Carroll at USC. Depending on his contract demands, Perry could make a lot of sense.

If the Seahawks are looking strictly for an edge rusher who might not have high salary demands, perhaps William Hayes, Mike Neal or Chris Long could fit.

Courtney Upshaw of the Baltimore Ravens has been a disappointment as a pass-rusher, but he can play the run well and drop into coverage.

As for the Seahawks' current roster, the options appear slim. Morgan is an unrestricted free agent, but the team could bring him back as insurance. Or they could put Kevin Pierre-Louis on the field with Bobby Wagner and K.J. Wright in their base looks. In that scenario, Wright probably would move to the strong side.

The Seahawks could go in a number of different directions. And while they've had plenty of time to come up with a plan for replacing Irvin, his versatility will certainly be missed.",[]
espn.com,,Morning 3-on-3 -- Will goaltending doom the Dallas Stars?,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Dan Marrazza', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Sean Allen', 'John Buccigross', 'Sarah Goldstein', 'Scott Burnside', 'John Rosengren', 'Paul Grant']","Hot and not

Jonas Gustavsson, Boston Bruins

Gustavsson continues to be a solid backup option in Boston, improving to 11-5-1 on the season after stopping all 42 shots he faced in a 1-0 overtime win over the Tampa Bay Lightning.

Henrik Zetterberg, Detroit Red Wings

A recent slump for the Red Wings has coincided with a cold spell for their captain. Zetterberg has not registered a point since Feb. 18 and is a minus-6 in the eight games since then.

Will suspect goaltending ruin the Dallas Stars' season?

@Real_ESPNLeBrun: Will goaltending be the Stars' undoing come playoff time? That's the uneasy feeling you get when examining the team here in the stretch run. They are in first place in the mighty Central Division, two points ahead of the Chicago Blackhawks, but after the 4-3 OT loss in Montreal on Tuesday, I again question whether the duo of Antti Niemi and Kari Lehtonen will be good enough to get the Stars a few rounds deep come playoff time. Lehtonen took the loss Tuesday, and his current .906 save percentage is good for just 36th in the league among qualified starters. Niemi's save percentage sits at .903, good for for 40th. Now, Niemi has won a Stanley Cup (with Chicago in 2010) and we know he can catch lightning in a bottle, so there's that. But I really worry for the Stars come crunch time given the kind of goaltending they're getting right now. Thoughts?

@ESPN_Burnside: It's interesting that you ask that question, Pierre, because I'm heading to Dallas to watch the Stars in two key Central Division matchups this weekend. The Stars host Chicago on Friday and the St. Louis Blues on Saturday, then follow that by hosting the Los Angeles Kings on Tuesday. We should be able to answer all your questions by the middle of next week. I have been impressed with the Stars' ability to put aside an ugly slide early in this calendar year and regain the swagger that made them the darlings of the first quarter of the NHL season. They're in a dogfight with Chicago and St. Louis for first place in the division, and while Dallas owns a nice 21-10-1 record at home, the Blackhawks' intimidating 24-8-2 mark at the United Center underscores the Stars' need to at least hold down the second spot in the division to maintain home-ice advantage in the first round. This Stars team is more playoff-ready, more mentally prepared for the challenges ahead, than Dallas was the past couple of years, but there's little doubt that goaltending is the reason many believe the Stars may not be ready for the long ride this spring. The next few days will tell us much about whether that view is accurate.

@CraigCustance: It's actually pretty amazing that the Stars are where they are, considering their goaltending. Dallas currently has a .917 even-strength save percentage, good for No. 27 in the league. They are keeping company at the bottom of those standings with teams like Edmonton, Carolina, Calgary, Montreal, Columbus and Toronto. None of those are playoff teams, let alone teams ready to challenge the reigning champs at the top of the standings. It's a little puzzling that both Niemi and Lehtonen are both below their career averages in save percentage. It raises the question of how much the Stars' offensive style of play is affecting their goaltending, but either way, this has to be a huge concern heading into the playoffs. The Stars are otherwise built to make a long run, but things are so tight that one or two bad games from the Dallas goaltenders early in the postseason will mean their run is over before it really even begins.

@ESPNJoeyMac: Oh, Stars fans are not going to be happy that anyone is suggesting there's an issue with their team. I've said all along the Stars would have problems once puck dropped for the Stanley Cup playoffs, and it starts in the defensive end. No doubt the Stars are an offensive juggernaut, but that will not win you a Cup. I recently had a conversation with a Western Conference scout who attended the last couple of Stars games, and he said that Tyler Seguin has been more or less a passenger and not very effective. Not that I'm singling him out, but it's an indication of this team's deficiencies. It all comes down to goaltending in the postseason, and if the Stars are struggling there, it doesn't bode well for their chances of advancing deep into the spring.

espn.com,,Kenyan champions Stanley Biwott and Mary Keitany put on a marathon masterclass,"['Roger Robinson', 'Sarah Gearhart']","Editor's note: This story originally appeared at Competitor.com.

NEW YORK -- Kenyans Mary Keitany and Stanley Biwott turned the 2015 TCS New York City Marathon into a five-borough classroom on Sunday, showing the other elite runners and the rest of the world how to produce 26.2-mile masterpieces.

Both were almost invisible in big packs that stayed watchfully together halfway through the race, but chose their moments to perfection and finished alone. Keitany won in 2 hours, 24 minutes, 25 seconds after a halfway split of 1:12:56; Biwott's finish was 2:10:34 after a half in 1:06:47. The math says it all.

The crucial moment came a little earlier for Keitany. She surged at 30K, arms pumping high across her diminutive frame, and instantly blew apart a group of six. Tigist Tufa (Ethiopia), who surprisingly beat Keitany to the win the 2015 London Marathon back in April, stuck close for awhile. Tufa stuck almost too close, as Keitany turned and snarled at her for jostling as they ran side by side through the Bronx.

""When I made my move around 30K, I say, 'OK, let me just go, and if somebody is more strong, she can come, and we can go. I was ready to go with her, but fortunately they never got me. I was feeling OK,"" Keitany said after the race.

Last week, she told Competitor she was determined not to repeat the mistake she made here in 2011, when she went out crazy-fast and lost a huge halfway lead.

This time, Keitany had it all under control and soon had all the space she needed. Tufa tightened and drifted back, and the once-fearsome Kenyan Priscah Jeptoo was also history. Ethiopian Aselefech Mergia eventually came through for second, but Keitany was alone and away, relentlessly piling the yards on to her lead. Even on the trying hills through Central Park she was running at 5:13-5:18 per-mile pace and finished, seemingly with strength in reserve, 66 seconds in the clear.

Editor's Picks Retired tennis star Blake finishes NYC Marathon James Blake had success at another iconic New York sporting event.

It was a supremely efficient racing performance by Keitany, who has made her mistakes in the past, but with Paula Radcliffe now retired, she is arguably the best woman now racing. She is the second-fastest woman (2:18:37) in marathon history behind Radcliffe, and in New York Keitany won her third major marathon (London 2012, New York City 2014). Disposing of Tufa will likely seem especially sweet, because Keitany seemed less than happy after the result in London earlier this year.

Biwott's record has been one of impressive near misses -- a second and a fourth in London, and fifth in New York in 2013. His only win was Paris in 2012. Taller than most Kenyans, he sometimes looks too big and galloping as he looms above the lead pack, but when the action started on Sunday he was flowing.

""During my previous marathons I was not able to run the last five kilometers at a consistent speed. So for my preparation I trained with a very good program of long runs at the full 42 kilometer distance, not 35. So I was able to have a lot of endurance speed to finish, not running slow at the end. So I was confident, and happy to be the winner, thank you,"" Biwott said.

Geoffrey Kamworor, the immensely promising 22-year-old Kenyan who pushed Mo Farah for the world 10,000-meters track championship over the summer, was the first to break up the pack. Kamworor's move came at what is becoming the traditional spot in the New York City men's race, just after 20 miles. The first major fallout was that the move blew away pre-race favorite and defending champion Wilson Kipsang. There was going to be a new name on the men's trophy.

There was more drama to come. Kamworor, though light on marathon experience (best of 2:06:12 in 2012), was the obvious threat and at first seemed in command. He has high credentials in track (world-championship silver at 10,000 meters in 2015), cross country (2015 world champion) and the half-marathon (2014 world champion, best of 58:54). That could have added up to a phenomenal first serious marathon.

Kamworor was thinking the same.

""When I decided to make a move, I knew I was feeling strong, and I was feeling OK. I knew I could make it all the way to the finish,"" Kamworor said.

But the gap we were watching for never came. Biwott and Lelisa Desisa kept it tight. Desisa, who narrowly lost here to Kipsang last year and is a double Boston champion (2013, 2015), was the first to lose his grip. Up the long gradual slope on the 24th mile along Fifth Avenue, it was Biwott who edged in front. Kamworor frowned, Desisa disappeared. Entering Central Park, there was daylight between Biwott and Kamworor, and it slowly increased.

Biwott's endurance training paid off, and he never faltered. His lead had grown to 14 seconds at the tape.

Notable among the top 10 finishers was the Japanese ""citizen runner"" Yuki Kawauchi, who gave Japan one of its best recent placings in sixth place, one ahead of top American Meb Keflizighi.

There were plenty of lessons for all citizen runners in New York today. Judge it right, run negative splits, and watch for the moment to make the break. But making the break is only half the battle, as Keitany and Biwott proved. Then you have to keep it, nurture it, and make it last all the way.",[]

""Each state has its unique constitutional structure, statutory structure and case law, thereby rendering different conclusions,"" Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin wrote in a Feb. 4, 2016, letter to Governor Gina Raimondo.

According to two formal opinion letters that were recently made public in the ongoing New York litigation -- one sent to DraftKings executive Tim Dent in 2013 and another sent to FanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles in 2014 -- there are four general categories of states.

""States fall in to four groups: states that ban contests where chance is a predominant or significant factor, states that ban contests where chance is a material factor, states that ban games with 'any' degree of chance and states that ban all cash games regardless of skill or chance,"" lawyers wrote in the letter to FanDuel.

Purdum: Why do some people hate daily fantasy sports? What is the origin of the hatred toward the daily fantasy industry? David Purdum spoke with more than 20 sources inside and outside the industry to find out. 1 Related

Court documents in New York indicate that just under half of the states fall into the ""predominance"" test category, the largest group by far.

""Most states use the predominance test when assessing the existence of the gambling element of chance,"" the 2013 letter stated to DraftKings. ""In other words, if the element of skill in a particular game predominates over chance, then the game is permitted."" With federal law noting that individual states have the ""primary responsibility"" to determine which activities constitute gambling within its borders, a diverse mash-up of laws has emerged through the decades. The result is that lobbyists for the fantasy industry probably won't be able to use a one-size-fits-all approach in the years ahead. The lack of guidance from court cases makes the diverse landscape tough to navigate, too.

espn.com,,NHL -- Star athletes who couldn't outlast Jaromir Jagr,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Dan Marrazza', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Sean Allen', 'John Buccigross', 'Sarah Goldstein', 'Scott Burnside', 'Paul Grant']","Linda Cohn sits down with Panthers winger Jaromir Jagr, who gives us a glimpse into his personality and the workout routine he credits with allowing him to continue playing at a high level in his 40s. (3:32)

Jaromir Jagr has gone on record as saying that Peyton Manning should not retire. The 44-year-old doesn't believe in going out on top.

""Why do you want to retire when your team won the championship? It wouldn't make sense to me. I'm always thinking differently than everybody else. Why you should retire on the top? I don't get it,"" Jagr said after the Denver Broncos won the Super Bowl. ""People say you should retire when you're the best. What's the reason? It doesn't make sense to me. Are you wanting to die when you hit 35 when you feel the best? You know what I mean?""

Editor's Picks Morning 3-on-3: Jagr just keeps on climbing the charts Jaromir Jagr just keeps on producing points, even at the age of 44. We talk about his amazing feat after he tied none other than Gordie Howe for career points with his effort Thursday night.

Burnside: No Jaromir Jagr on Team Czech Republic? The Czechs' 16-man roster includes some obvious picks, but has one key omission -- Jaromir Jagr, one of the game's greatest players, who still seems to have what it takes.

Powers: Jaromir Jagr is defying age At 43, Jaromir Jagr remains one of the strongest and hardest-working players in the NHL. And if his health holds up, he plans to keep it that way into his 50s. 2 Related

Even if we do know what Jagr means, it is clear that what he is accomplishing at his age is beyond explanation.

Jagr played his first NHL game on Oct. 5, 1990. That night he was playing against current NHL head coaches Joel Quenneville and Dave Tippett.

There were 11 players in this year's NHL All-Star Game who were not born when Jagr played his first NHL game, including his Florida Panthers' teammate Aaron Ekblad. And the same is true of more than one-third of the league.

The Panthers' franchise didn't even exist then.

So what else has come and gone in that time?

Here are some recently retired athletes and what they were doing in 1990:

Peyton Manning -- Manning retires with two Super Bowl rings. He is the NFL's all-time leader in passing touchdowns, passing yards and quarterback wins. He played in 266 NFL games, but he still didn't last nearly as long as Jagr. Manning was 14 years old when Jagr debuted in the NHL. By the time Manning made the Colts' roster, Jagr was starting his ninth season with the Pittsburgh Penguins.

Kobe Bryant -- We've seen Bryant go from a confident 18-year-old to an aging veteran since being drafted in 1996. But when Jagr started playing in the NHL, Bryant was still living in Italy while his father was playing professional basketball.

Martin Brodeur -- Drafted by the New Jersey Devils with the 20th overall pick in the 1990 NHL draft (Jagr was taken with the fifth pick), Brodeur didn't get his first NHL action until one season after Jagr when he played four games during the 1991-92 season. Brodeur won the Calder Trophy for the 1993-94 season.

Martin St. Louis -- The undrafted, undersized forward wouldn't play his first NHL game until 1998-99. In 1990, St. Louis turned 15 and was one year away from playing for the Laval-Laurentides of the QAAA.

Derek Jeter -- Jeter played 2,747 games for the Yankees in less time than Jagr has been an NHL player. Jeter wasn't drafted until 1992, around the same time the Penguins were winning their second Cup in as many seasons.

Steve Nash -- In his first full year of retirement, Nash is still putting off a full-time NBA job. But maybe at 16 years old, the Canadian was watching Jagr's first game?

Ed Reed -- Reed played 174 games in the NFL before announcing his retirement in 2015. But he was only 12 years old when Jagr played the first of his 1,612 regular-season games.

Tim Hudson -- Hudson left the mound at 40 years old after 17 seasons in the majors, but his career didn't begin until 1999, at a point when Jagr was already a two-time Stanley Cup winner. In 1990, Hudson was still in high school in Alabama.

Abby Wambach -- Wambach ended her career on Dec. 16, 2015. Only 10 years old when Jagr played his first game, Wambach won an NCAA national championship as a freshman at the University of Florida in 1998 and played her first game for the U.S. women's soccer team in 2001.

Jeff Gordon -- In 1990, Gordon was 19 and being named the USAC National Midget Series Champion. It wasn't until 1991 when he was named the Busch Series rookie of the year, and in 1993 he became the Winston Cup Series rookie of the year.

Floyd Mayweather -- Mayweather says he is retired, ending his career with a 49-0 record and world titles in five weight divisions over 19 years. He was 13 years old when Jagr began his NHL career.

Daniel Bryan -- The 34-year-old Bryan was forced to retire from the WWE because of concussion issues. He first signed with the WWE in 2009 and became a star in 2012. But he was only 9 years old when Jagr entered the NHL ring.",[]

espn.com,,"Lakers' win is glimpse of future: No Kobe, but kids carrying the load","['Espn Com', 'Baxter Holmes']","With Kobe Bryant out with a shoulder injury, rookie D'Angelo Russell leads the Lakers with 27 points on 11-of-19 shooting in a 107-98 win over the Magic. (1:11)

LOS ANGELES -- The past two wins tease a future that is endlessly bright. Just about any outcome seems reasonable if the Los Angeles Lakers young core keeps progressing as it has recently, much to the delight of fans who have been patiently waiting for some glimmer of hope in an otherwise lost season.

But optimism finally arrived Sunday, when the Lakers upset the mighty Golden State Warriors, and it continued Tuesday, when instead of reveling in that win, the Lakers -- playing without Kobe Bryant (sore right shoulder) -- built on it by beating the Orlando Magic 107-98 at Staples Center.

It was important, said Lakers forward Julius Randle. We have to show that we have grown and are not satisfied with one game but are able to come back the next game and play well again.

It marked the first game that DAngelo Russell (a game-high 27 points), Jordan Clarkson (24) and Randle (23) each broke the 20-point barrier, an outcome that will probably repeat itself -- perhaps on a near-nightly basis -- in the near future.

Randle, the No. 7 overall pick in the 2014 draft, tied his career high in scoring, and his 11 rebounds gave him his 28th double-double of the season, which is the most among second-year players. Clarkson, a first-team all-rookie selection last season, hit five 3-pointers. Russell, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2015 draft, shot 11-of-19 from the field.

""They had the three best players on the floor tonight,"" said Orlando coach Scott Skiles. ""Generally, when you have that, you win the game.""

On top of that, Lakers rookie forward Larry Nance Jr., the No. 27 overall pick in the 2015 draft, added eight points and 10 rebounds off the bench.

D'Angelo Russell, Julius Randle and Jordan Clarkson each scored more than 20 points on Tuesday night. Victor Decolongon/Getty Images

Granted, the Magic were playing the second game of a back-to-back set and were without one of their top players -- star forward Nikola Vucevic. And granted, the Magic have a losing record (now 27-36). So its not as though one could say the Lakers, who are now 14-51, have truly turned the corner or anything like that.

People keep saying it over and over, said Russell, who has scored 20 points or more in six of his past seven games. Weve got to continue to keep proving it. We believe in each other. We know what each other are capable of. Weve got to string some more wins together and make progress before we start speaking that far in advance.""

Indeed, its not time to plan the parade route just yet. But the Lakers kids are all right, and theyre displaying the kind of promise that breeds hope. After all, Russell is 20, Randle is 21 and Clarkson and Nance are 23. If they keep this up, who knows where they could lead the Lakers or who might come join them in L.A.

This is what we thought they could play like, said Lakers coach Byron Scott.

Scott has taken heat for bringing them along slowly and for benching them for long stretches earlier this season, but he maintains that his approach was vital.

From the start of the season, we all knew it was going to take these guys time, Scott said. Its just a matter of how much time. As far as the plan goes, it was just to groom these guys and get them ready as much as possible and see which ones would grow a little bit faster than the others; and the ones that were a little bit slower, you just try to help them catch up.

For now, the Lakers are riding the momentum of a two-game winning streak, of winning three of their past five games. Theyre clearly more comfortable on the court together, which is the product of experience and improving chemistry.

We play with each other so much that we start to get that [feel] for each other and know where guys like the ball and when guys are uncomfortable, Russell said.

Its also the product of their growth in Scotts new offensive set, which was installed in recent weeks and is predicated on ball movement.

Were starting to move the ball, Nance said. We had a bunch of stats shown to us today where weve improved our ball movement, weve stopped dribbling so much. Its little stuff like that that can really spark a team.

As Clarkson added, We were very unselfish tonight, and we just played well alongside each other.

Thursday offers another tough test: LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers. If the Lakers win that game, thus knocking off another Finals squad from last season, then the imaginations of Lakers fans will truly run wild with possibility, and rightly so.

But regardless of Thursday's outcome, Lakers fans now know that better days are really and truly ahead, and that those days are really and truly unfolding right in front of their eyes.",[]

Crystal Dunn's goal is the difference in USA's 1-0 win over England in the SheBelieves Cup. NEXT VIDEO

TAMPA, Fla. -- Given what each already does well, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world for the U.S. women's national team if Crystal Dunn and Mallory Pugh stage an ""anything you can do, I can do better"" duel through the spring and into the summer.

Your turn, Mallory.

Thursday's game against England in the opening round of the four-team SheBelieves Cup was the first this year that felt, at times, as if it posed the sort of problems the United States would have to solve in the late rounds of a major tournament.

AP Photo/Mike Carlson Mallory Pugh, the 17-year-old wunderkind on the U.S. roster, has started three consecutive games. Crystal Dunn has come off the bench in those same matches.

It felt a few weeks ago as if Mexico might sneak out a near-miraculous draw in the groups stage of Olympic qualifying. It felt for a time as if Canada, at less than full strength by varying degree of choice, might be able to sneak out a result in the meaningless final of that tournament.

Not just in the moment but never more than when England's Toni Duggan raced down the right side in the second half with teammate Jodie Taylor and absolutely no one in an American jersey to her left, it felt as if the United States might lose this game.

Then Duggan, told in no uncertain terms by her coach earlier in the night to take the shots presented, opted against playing the ball to Taylor and instead challenged Hope Solo with the kind of effort that simply doesn't beat the American keeper.

Not long after, and not long after she entered as a substitute for the third consecutive time since matching a U.S. record with five goals in a game, Crystal Dunn took the shot presented her, too. She received the ball from Meghan Klingenberg with her back to goal near the edge of the 18-yard box, turned, took a couple of touches to get the ball out in front of her and let it rip in the 72nd minute.

England keeper Karen Bardsley never had a chance to stop it, and it was all the United States needed for a 1-0 win.

""This is what she can pull out, is just these exceptional efforts,"" U.S. coach Jill Ellis said of Dunn's strike. ""It was a world-class goal. Hopefully it's on SportsCenter tonight.""

The ball tore into the top corner with the kind of velocity usually reserved for the fastballs thrown on nearby baseball diamonds during spring training. It would be a neat narrative trick to say it carried with it the frustrations of not starting the past few games, but Dunn is about the least angry elite athlete you're likely to meet. And it's not as if she hasn't done this before. Well, maybe not this.

""It definitely goes down in probably my top five in my whole career,"" said Dunn, a college national champion and Under-20 world champion. ""For me, it was a really good feeling, obviously us winning the whole game. It really made me feel like a key member of the team.""

And therein is the real significance of this game and this tournament. As good as it felt to those involved, the result is only part of what matters, just as a 2-0 loss to France early last year mattered more as an experience than a defeat.

""The emotion of dealing with this is a big part of it,"" Ellis said of Thursday's lessons. ""Take the tactics off the spectrum for a second and just look at the dealing with the intensity in front of a crowd -- and I've got some younger players out here. I think that was a big part of dealing with the pressure cooker, I call it. These are our games that obviously count, so seeing [Emily] Sonnett, seeing Pugh, seeing [Lindsey] Horan in there, I learned those things in terms of how they deal with that kind of pressure.""

These games are made for Dunn and Pugh to learn from them. Perhaps just not at the same time.

There is an ongoing competition for minutes between Dunn and Pugh, the 17-year-old wunderkind who not coincidentally started for the third game in a row, as one of the wide players flanking Carli Lloyd. When Dunn plays, it is generally in the space on the right side as the United States goes forward, in front of right back Ali Krieger (or on this night, Kelley O'Hara). When Pugh plays, it is usually on the left side of the field in front of Klingenberg, Tobin Heath playing whichever side is needed opposite Pugh or Dunn. There is therefore some irony that goal came from the left side off an assist from Klingenberg.

""We have a deep roster, and for me it's not about the amount of minutes you play,"" Dunn said. ""I think anyone who has been on this team who has played the role I played tonight, coming off the bench, knows that everyone wants to be that person starting. And you want to be that one walking out in the beginning. But at the end of the day, it's about making do with the minutes you're given. I'm not going to sit here and complain about the minutes I was given because I think I made do with it.""

Brian Blanco/Getty Images U.S. goalkeeper Hope Solo recorded her 96th career shutout Thursday. Up next for the Americans? France on Sunday in Nashville, followed by Germany next Wednesday in Florida.

She did that and then some.

Competition isn't a bad thing. Competition need not be controversy, and American coaches and players are pretty clear that competition within the team is as much a part of the team's blueprint for success. They don't get a lot of games like the one against England or those upcoming against France and Germany, so the tests usually come from within the culture. Thursday just happened to play out in front of all of us.

And while Dunn won the game, the comparison with Pugh was more like a draw.

Limited though they were, Pugh played a part in most of the chances the United States had in the first half. A burst of speed on the left side gave her room to cross the ball into the box in the 13th minute, but it went for naught with Alex Morgan and Lloyd too close together for either to get a clean look at goal. Playing beyond both her years and height, Pugh later attempted to head a ball past the last line of defense and outrun England to goal, stopped only at the last second.

It is pretty clear that, offensively, Pugh can hold her own at this level. If she defends, too, she is going to play. But so is Dunn in some capacity, in part because of what she did Thursday night but also because, while older than Pugh, she is still a young professional growing into what the United States wants tactically out of that role.

""Crystal is a player that is probably most comfortable in a wide area, she likes to go at players,"" Ellis said the day before the game against England. ""I think both of the players are one-v-one, they like to take on. I think Mallory, probably if you were to ask me her more natural position, it would be floating in as a 10. So I think she comes in to inside spaces. I think Crystal, if she's in there, is immediately going to turn and try and run at the back line.

""I think they have, obviously, a lot of athleticism between them. There's a lot of similarities.""

It definitely goes down in probably my top five in my whole career. ... It really made me feel like a key member of the team. Crystal Dunn on her goal Thursday

This wasn't a masterpiece of a performance by the United States. England executed its plan to near perfection, thanks in no small part to 5-foot-2 Jordan Nobbs, who sat deep in the midfield and made it difficult for anyone to get the ball to Lloyd for much of the evening. Mexico forced the U.S. women to slowly break it down, but England forced the Americans to adjust. It ultimately forced the United States to turn to a moment of brilliance for the win. Dunn's goal gave the team a win. It didn't mean the U.S. passed every part of the night, at least not to the degree needed in Rio.

""I think our decision making could have been faster,"" Ellis said. ""I thought we moved the ball fairly well, got numbers around the ball at times. I just think that sometimes we stayed too much central. ...

""That's a team that's going to put you under a lot of pressure. They're going to bang it long, run in and pressure the heck out of you. We tried to stay committed to trying to play out, but that's a lot of pressure for a younger team.""

England coach Mark Sampson said afterward that his team, the plucky feel-good story of the World Cup, now had to judge itself on results. It wasn't enough to simply acquit itself well against the world champions on their turf in a game in which some (Sampson included) felt England deserved a penalty kick for a handball in the box as his team tested the American back line. Yet if disappointed, he acknowledged reality.

""You're bringing someone like Crystal Dunn off the bench, a player who can do something like that,"" Sampson said, ""You've got to be a half-decent team.""

With either Dunn or Pugh, the world champions are that.",[]

espn.com,,Brock Osweiler's departure puts Broncos on hunt for quarterback,"['Espn Stats', 'Jamison Hensley', 'Jeff Legwold']","Adam Schefter breaks down why he thinks QB Brock Osweiler decided to sign with the Texans over the Broncos, as well as what he believes the Broncos plan will be moving forward to fill their void at quarterback. (1:37)

ENGLEWOOD, Colo. -- When it comes to the whole quarterback thing, John Elway has been there, done that. When Elway says the position is the most important to build a roster around, he means it.

A Hall of Fame passer who now calls the football shots in the front office for the Denver Broncos, Elway knows what he wants, and likes, at the position.

After Brock Osweiler's representatives informed the Broncos the 25-year-old intended to sign a four-year deal with the Houston Texans Wednesday, Trevor Siemian -- a seventh-round draft pick in 2015 who spent most of last season as a game-day inactive -- is the lone quarterback on the depth chart.

The Broncos tried hard to re-sign Osweiler, but they were simply not going to go to the $18 million-a-year plateau he reached with the Texans.

The Broncos started in the $12 million to $13 million per year range and were willing to go to $15 million to $16 million in the closing hours of negotiations. But they were not, as had been Elways way in free agency, coming too far off the line they had drawn.

Osweiler gets the fresh start he appears to have wanted outside of the guy-who-follows-Peyton-Manning shadow that will be cast in the Broncos offense. And the Broncos must now move on to Plan B and beyond.

With Brock Osweiler's departure, the Broncos have questions at a foundation position both now and down the road. Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images

And that could mean a variety of things. They could sign a veteran player in the short term, like former New York Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick or former Redskins QB Robert Griffin III, and start on the course of finding another potential long-term prospect at the position by using their first- or second-round pick in this years draft.

Thats the strategy that had the most traction with the Broncos as they worked through the what-if scenarios in recent weeks. Around the league, however, the current free-agent market is considered thin at the position, which is why Osweiler garnered the big contract.

The 33-year-old Fitzpatrick is near the top of most personnel executives' rankings, at least for the short term, of that group of free-agent passers. And it can't be ignored that Fitzpatrick and Osweiler have the same agent -- Jimmy Sexton.

Many in the league think Griffin, who had a stormy tenure with the Washington Redskins before his release but would fit the Broncos' scheme, would need some time as a backup to re-calibrate himself as a player before he could be a starter again. Griffin didn't exactly have the best of times in Mike Shanahan's offense following a knee injury, which is a lot like the offense Gary Kubiak wants to run with the Broncos.

The Broncos could try to trade for San Francisco 49ers starter Colin Kaepernick as the 49ers retool their offense for coach Chip Kelly. San Francisco general manager Trent Baalke and Elway are friends, but since the Broncos would have to take Kaepernicks contract in any trade, that would require some serious, almost prohibitive, salary-cap gymnastics from the Broncos.

Kaepernick's salary-cap figure is $15.27 million for the upcoming season and $19.87 million in 2017. The Broncos, by league rules, would have to make the trade and add Kaepernicks current contract to their salary cap before they could rework the deal, which runs through 2020 and has dead-money"" impact if a team later released Kaepernick after 2018.

It should be noted the Broncos do like Siemian as a prospect -- Kubiak has repeatedly said Siemian has a pro arm, no doubt about it -- but Siemian is fairly early in his developmental curve. And it's a big jump from emergency No. 2 quarterback when Manning was injured this past season to starter for defending the Super Bowl champions.

Elway has always said he's about making sure we have contingencies ... because my job is to look two, three years down the road, not just at what were doing now. But with Osweilers departure, the Broncos have questions at a foundation position both now and down the road.",[]

espn.com,2016-03-09 21:51:09+00:00,Gonzaga Is A Major Team In A Minor Conference,['Neil Paine'],"Going into conference tournament week, the Gonzaga Bulldogs were no lock to extend their string of consecutive NCAA tourney berths to 18 years. To maintain the streak, the Zags probably needed to run the West Coast Conference tournament table, since an at-large bid was unlikely with seven losses on their resume. The automatic-bid route was how Gonzaga qualified for 13 of the previous 17 NCAA tournaments, but it wasnt even the conference favorite this year.

The streak, tied for seventh-longest in history, seemed to be in jeopardy.

Three victories later, the Bulldogs are West Coast champs and tournament-bound. Since its streak began in 1998-99, Gonzaga has been the best non-power-conference school, going by cumulative adjusted net efficiency:

ADJUSTED NET EFFICIENCY SCHOOL PRIMARY CONFERENCE WINS LOSSES TEAM OTHER CONF. MEMBERS DIFF 1 Gonzaga West Coast 484 117 +17.57 -0.34 +17.92 2 Memphis Conference USA 442 172 +14.84 +4.34 +10.50 3 Xavier Atlantic 10 355 145 +14.64 +4.11 +10.54 4 Butler Horizon League 356 136 +12.83 +0.34 +12.49 5 BYU Mountain West 395 185 +12.07 +4.48 +7.59 6 Temple Atlantic 10 373 222 +11.99 +4.56 +7.44 7 Creighton Missouri Valley 353 147 +11.62 +4.02 +7.60 8 Wichita St. Missouri Valley 373 208 +10.39 +3.72 +6.67 9 Dayton Atlantic 10 384 203 +9.54 +4.72 +4.82 10 UNLV Mountain West 371 201 +9.16 +5.34 +3.82 Best non-power-conference programs of the last 18 seasons SourceS: Ken Pomeroy, Daniel Myers

(Note that Im defining power conferences as the ACC, Big 8/Big 12, Big East  but not its offshoot the AAC, which has had the power ratings and total NCAA bids of a mid-major thus far  Big Ten, Pac-10/Pac-12 and SEC. I also filtered out teams like Cincinnati and Louisville that played fewer than three-quarters of their games in a non-power conference.)

As you might expect, Gonzaga towers over the other mid-majors. But even more striking might be the heights to which its risen over its fellow WCC members; as the Bulldogs were putting together the 12th-best rating of any program in the nation, the average non-Gonzaga WCC team has been worse than the average Division I school over the same span. Since 99, the Bulldogs have dominated their conference more than any other mid-major; second place (Butler) isnt especially close.

The same holds true if we expand beyond our admittedly selective endpoints and look at more than Gonzagas streak. Here are the top non-power teams of the 64-team NCAA Tournament era (since 1984-85):

ADJUSTED NET EFFICIENCY SCHOOL PRIMARY CONFERENCE WINS LOSSES TEAM OTHER CONF. MEMBERS DIFF 1 Memphis Conference USA 733 324 +13.61 +5.96 +7.65 2 Temple Atlantic 10 689 351 +13.37 +4.18 +9.19 3 Xavier Atlantic 10 640 267 +12.45 +2.95 +9.50 4 Gonzaga West Coast 689 279 +11.64 -0.47 +12.11 5 UNLV Mountain West 715 310 +11.33 +3.60 +7.74 6 Utah Western Athletic 531 289 +10.37 +4.11 +6.26 7 BYU Western Athletic 648 362 +9.52 +3.78 +5.74 8 New Mexico Mountain West 658 357 +8.47 +4.30 +4.17 9 Tulsa Missouri Valley 631 381 +8.19 +2.23 +5.96 10 Butler Midwestern Collegiate 554 323 +7.69 +0.48 +7.21 Best non-power-conference programs of the 64-team bracket era SourceS: Ken Pomeroy, Daniel Myers

Over this extended time period, the Zags are surpassed by Memphis, Temple and Xavier overall but remain the most dominant relative to the rest of their conference.

Super Bowl I: Green Bay Packers (-14) vs Kansas City Chiefs

O/U: N/A

In the first Super Bowl, the NFL's Packers were two-touchdown favorites against the AFL's Chiefs. The Chiefs were competitive in the first half, trailing 14-10, but Green Bay outscored Kansas City 21-0 in the second half to cover the spread. This was the only Super Bowl not to feature an over/under.

ATS winner: Green Bay

Score: Packers 35, Chiefs 10

Super Bowl II: Green Bay Packers (-13.5) vs Oakland Raiders

O/U: 43

Once again, the Packers were a heavy favorite over the AFL representative. And once again, the Packers dominated, covering the spread for most of the second half. This was the first Super Bowl to feature an over/under. Daryle Lamonica's touchdown pass with 9:45 left put the game over the total.

ATS winner: Green Bay

Score: Packers 33, Raiders 14

Super Bowl III: Baltimore Colts (-18) vs New York Jets

O/U: 40

For the third straight year, the NFL champion was a double-digit favorite over the AFL champion. New York closed as an 18-point underdog (after opening at +17), tied for the biggest underdog in Super Bowl history. This time, the AFL got the last laugh, as the Jets never trailed against the heavily-favored Colts. Baltimore did not score until late in the fourth quarter, making this an easy win for Jets backers, just as Joe Namath had guaranteed.

ATS winner: New York (A)

Score: Jets 16, Colts 7

Super Bowl IV: Minnesota Vikings (-12) vs Kansas City Chiefs

O/U: 39

In the first year since the AFL/NFL merger, a former AFL team pulled off another double-digit upset. Kansas City led 16-0 at halftime and 23-7 entering the fourth quarter. The total was in doubt entering the fourth, but a scoreless quarter ensured the game to go under the total.

ATS winner: Kansas City

Score: Chiefs 23, Vikings 7

Super Bowl V: Dallas Cowboys (-2.5) vs Baltimore Colts

O/U: 36

Another year, another underdog victory, but this time the game came down to the wire. Dallas led by a touchdown entering the final stanza, but the Colts tied the game at 13 midway through the fourth quarter. Jim O'Brien hit the game-winning field goal with 5 seconds left to give the Colts the win and the cover. A scoreless third quarter helped the game stay under the total.

ATS winner: Baltimore

Score: Colts 16, Cowboys 13

Super Bowl VI: Dallas Cowboys (-6) vs Miami Dolphins

O/U: 34

After three straight years of the underdog winning the Super Bowl outright, Super Bowl VI began a nine-year streak of the favorite winning outright. The Cowboys held the Dolphins to just 3 points, which remains the fewest points every scored in Super Bowl history. As a result, Dallas covered easily and the game stayed under the total again. The line closed at Dallas -6 after it opened as a four-point favorite. No Super Bowl would move that many points off the opening line again until Super Bowl XXIII.

ATS winner: Dallas

Score: Cowboys 24, Dolphins 3

Super Bowl VII: Miami Dolphins (-1.5) vs Washington Redskins

O/U: 33

Despite being the first team in Super Bowl history to enter the game undefeated, Miami was just a 1.5-point favorite over Washington. That was partly due to a weak schedule for Miami -- the Dolphins' regular-season opponents were a combined 70-122-4 that season. However, Miami held Washington without a point until there was 2:07 remaining in the game, covering easily. The game stayed under for the fifth straight season. It was the first of three straight seasons of the over/under being 33, which is the lowest total in Super Bowl history.

ATS winner: Miami

Score: Dolphins 14, Redskins 7

Super Bowl VIII: Miami Dolphins (-6.5) vs Minnesota Vikings

O/U: 33

Once again, the winning bet was Miami and the under. The Dolphins jumped out to a 24-0 lead entering the fourth quarter, so the spread was never in doubt, but the total was. Dolphins defensive back Curtis Johnson intercepted Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton in Dolphins territory with less than 7 minutes to go to keep the game under 33 points.

ATS winner: Miami

Score: Dolphins 24, Vikings 7

Super Bowl IX: Pittsburgh Steelers (-3) vs Minnesota Vikings

O/U: 33

For the fourth straight season, the favorite covered the spread, and for the seventh straight year, the Super Bowl stayed under the total. The Steelers led just 2-0 at halftime, and they led by three late in the fourth quarter before a Terry Bradshaw touchdown pass with 3:38 left extended the Steelers lead to 10 points to cover the spread.

ATS winner: Pittsburgh

Score: Steelers 16, Vikings 6

Super Bowl X: Pittsburgh Steelers (-6.5) vs Dallas Cowboys

O/U: 36

This game featured the first backdoor cover in Super Bowl history. After Pittsburgh went up 21-10 with 3:31 left, Roger Staubach hit Percy Howard with 1:56 left to trim the Steelers' lead to four, within the 6.5-point spread. Dallas actually had one last drive to try and win the game, but the drive stalled at the Steelers 38. The worst bad beat belonged to those who took the under. The teams combined for 17 points in the first three quarters before exploding for 21 points in the fourth, culminating in Howard's touchdown. The Cowboys became the first team to lose the Super Bowl but cover the spread, a feat that wouldn't be repeated until Super Bowl XXIII.

ATS winner: Dallas

Score: Steelers 21, Cowboys 17

Super Bowl XI: Oakland Raiders (-4.5) vs Minnesota Vikings

O/U: 38

The Raiders easily covered the 4.5-point spread, but the total came down to the fourth quarter. Raiders defensive back Willie Brown returned a Tarkenton pass 75 yards for a touchdown with 6:04 to go to give Oakland a 32-7 lead, over the total of 38. Minnesota tacked on a late touchdown with 31 seconds left, which could have affected anyone who teased the under.

ATS winner: Oakland

Score: Raiders 32, Vikings 14

Super Bowl XII: Dallas Cowboys (-6) vs Denver Broncos

O/U: 39

Seeing a pattern here? Again, the favorite covered relatively easily, but the total was in doubt late. Trailing 27-10 late in the fourth quarter, Denver moved the ball to the Cowboys 11-yard line. After a couple negative plays, Denver faced a fourth-and-23 from the Cowboys 24 with less than four minutes remaining. Rather than kick the field goal which would have put the game over the total, Denver opted to go for it, throwing an incomplete pass to seal the under.

ATS winner: Dallas

Score: Cowboys 27, Broncos 10

Super Bowl XIII: Pittsburgh Steelers (-3.5) vs Dallas Cowboys

O/U: 37

The Steelers led Super Bowl XIII 21-14 in the first half, nearly putting the game over the total by halftime. Pittsburgh extended its lead to 35-17 with less than 7 minutes to go. Dallas mounted a rally to cut the lead back to 4, but not enough to cover the 3.5-point spread. Dallas scored its final touchdown with 26 seconds remaining to cut the lead to 35-31. Perhaps if the two-point conversion rule had existed, Dallas would have gone for two to make it a three-point deficit and provide a miracle backdoor cover, but the NFL did not adopt the two-point conversion until 1994.

Super Bowl XIV: Pittsburgh Steelers (-10.5) vs Los Angeles Rams

O/U: 36

The Steelers improved to 4-0 in the Super Bowl, but they didn't make it easy for those who bet the them to cover. Up 24-19 late in the fourth quarter, Bradshaw hit John Stallworth for a 45-yard gain on third down to extend the Steelers' drive. Franco Harris scored on third-and-goal with 1:52 remaining to extend the Steelers' lead to 12. The Rams' ensuing drive stalled at the Steelers' 37-yard line to secure the cover for Pittsburgh.

San Francisco led 20-0 at halftime and while Cincinnati scored a touchdown to cut the 49ers lead to five with 20 seconds left, they never threatened to win.

Super Bowl XVIII: Washington Redskins (-3.5) vs Los Angeles Raiders

O/U: 48

Marcus Allen and the Raiders dominated the Redskins in Super Bowl XVIII, as the point spread was never in doubt. The game seemed likely to go over the total, as it entered the fourth quarter with a combined 44 points (Raiders 35, Redskins 9), but the teams scored just 3 points in the final quarter. The Redskins had the first chance to put the game over the total, but Joe Theismann fumbled in the red zone with 9:13 left.

Super Bowl XIX: San Francisco 49ers (-3) vs Miami Dolphins

This was the first Super Bowl to feature an over/under in the 50s, and it didn't take long to hit the over. Joe Montana's touchdown pass with 6:43 left in the third quarter put the score at 38-16 49ers.

espn.com,,Remembering the one-of-a-kind Bud Collins,"['Greg Garber', 'Mark Hodgkinson', 'Peter Bodo', 'Pa Sport', 'Espn Com', 'Espn Staff']","In 1968, the first year professional players were allowed to compete at Grand Slam tournaments, pro tennis was in need of an effective advocate. It found one in Arthur W. ""Bud"" Collins, a gregarious young newspaperman and tennis enthusiast.

Collins, who died Friday at age 86, will likely be remembered as the leading tennis correspondent of his time. But even that encomium doesn't come close to putting his contribution to the sport into perspective or leave us with an adequate grasp of the central place he held in the game for nearly half a century. Bud Collins was as deeply woven into the history of Open tennis as the elaborate pattern in a Persian carpet.

In the big picture, Collins introduced tennis to legions of baby boomers who were thirsty for new entertainment. He played a leading role in demystifying the game, paving the way for tennis to become a massively popular participant and spectator sport. He accomplished that mainly through ceaseless efforts from his bully pulpit as a print and television journalist and author.

There can't ever be another Bud Collins, just as there can't ever be another revolution like the advent of Open tennis. He was the right man at the right time, and he took full advantage of all the opportunities he was afforded as the game flourished all around him. He was Zelig-like, with a critical difference: Collins actually had an impact on the people and events around him.

The first full-time job Collins took was that of a reporter at The Boston Globe in 1963. His love of tennis left him well-positioned at the paper when tennis interest began to surge during the ""tennis boom"" of the late 1960s. As a result, Collins pulled some plum assignments. He was the official press representative on a number of foreign goodwill tours by the U.S. Davis Cup squad, sponsored by the U.S. State Department.

The players on these public relations junkets included Arthur Ashe, Stan Smith, Bob Lutz and others. Collins formed lifelong friendships with them. He also accompanied Ashe on his historic and controversial first visit to South Africa, before the fall of apartheid. Collins recounted many of these experiences in his 1989 book, ""My Life with the Pros.""

Despite the international character of tennis, Collins never forgot his Boston roots. The tennis coach at Brandeis University for five years, he retained a special fondness for Boston's Longwood Cricket Club and the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island. Collins was a supporter of eccentric millionaire Jimmy Van Alen. (Collins dubbed him ""the Newport Bolshevik"" because of Van Alen's desire to revolutionize tennis rules.) Collins' advocacy helped publicize and eventually sell the tennis establishment on Van Alen's pet project, adopting the tiebreaker.

Editor's Picks Social reaction: Remembering the legendary Bud Collins The sports universe paid tribute to the legendary Bud Collins, one of the most prominent, colorful and genuinely nice figures the game has ever seen.

Hall of Fame tennis journalist Collins dies at 86 Bud Collins, who wrote his way into the International Tennis Hall of Fame, died Friday at age 86. 1 Related

Collins may have been the very first newspaperman to make a transition to television reporting, signing with CBS in 1968 to work on tennis broadcasts while still working for the Globe. He was also a mainstay of a series of Monday night U.S. clay-court tennis finals broadcast on PBS in the early 1970s -- a sequence of broadcasts that helped fuel the tennis boom. But Collins was most widely known for his cheery, bow-tied presence and trademark floral-pattern trousers on NBC's long-running ""Breakfast at Wimbledon"" telecasts.

The early years of Open tennis were marked by bitter battles among various factions vying for control of the game. Collins assiduously avoided choosing sides; he was friendly but skeptical of all, often likening tennis promoters to boxing impresarios. He was dismayed by the flagrant conflicts of interest that acted as a drag on the growth of the game, but he understood the underlying political realities. He never allowed disillusion with the powers-that-be to corrupt his love of the game -- or his fondness for the players.

Most of all, Collins loved the players. He loved writing about the staggering panoply of characters and personalities that make up the body of elite pros. His prose was chatty and casual. Through the years, it became idiosyncratic. His columns were laden with puns, esoteric historical references and the minutiae of the game. As an interviewer, Collins eschewed the solemn approach and often engaged his subjects in a light-hearted, even irreverent manner.

He modestly but proudly described himself as a ""hacker,"" and he had the true hacker's reverence for those who played the game as it was meant to be played. Although he had coached, it was the players rather than the game that bewitched Collins.

That was the secret to Collins' longevity in the game, this fascination with the ever-changing cast of characters. It's also the thing that kept him in journalism, resisting the allure of tennis politics or promotion. His simple love of the game and those who played it was communicable.

Collins was an avuncular figure beloved to young, impressionable journalists. By the end of his career, he spent more time being interviewed than interviewing. He had always made a point to welcome and encourage young or new reporters in the press rooms of the world. Thus almost every under-50 journalist out there has a ""Why I love Bud Collins"" story to tell.

The question will come up: What is Collins' legacy? It will be difficult to come up with a satisfying, clear answer because, beyond the pun-laden prose, the kindness to his peers, the irreverent on-camera inquisitions and those loud, custom-made pants, Collins was a unique figure.

He was the right person in the right place at a right time that won't ever come again.",[]
espn.com,,Manufacturer says 4-6 weeks is normal treatment for drug in Maria Sharapova case,"['Niall Seewang', 'Greg Garber', 'Mark Hodgkinson', 'Nic Atkin', 'Peter Bodo', 'Pa Sport', 'Bonnie D', 'Espn Com', 'Espn Staff', 'Jim Caple']","Chrissie Evert explores Maria Sharapova's failed drug test for Meldonium and how Sharapova's isolation within the tennis world has led to her peers remaining mum about the situation. (3:11)

MOSCOW -- The drug at the center of Maria Sharapova's doping case, regularly given to Soviet troops in the 1980s to boost their stamina while fighting in Afghanistan, is normally prescribed for medical use for periods of four to six weeks.

Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam champion, faces possible sanctions after testing positive for meldonium, also known as mildronate, a drug the Russian tennis star said she said she had been using for 10 years for various medical issues. Sharapova did not indicate in her announcement Monday how often she has taken it.

Her lawyer, John J. Haggerty, declined to go into specifics Tuesday but said during a conference call he wanted ""to disabuse the concept that Maria took mildronate every day for 10 years because that's simply not the case.""

The Latvian company that manufactures meldonium said the normal course of treatment is much shorter.

""Depending on the patient's health condition, treatment course of meldonium preparations may vary from four to six weeks,"" Grindeks said in an emailed statement Tuesday to The Associated Press. ""Treatment course can be repeated twice or thrice a year. Only physicians can follow and evaluate patient's health condition and state whether the patient should use meldonium for a longer period of time.""

Meldonium, which Maria Sharapova tested positive for, was banned because it aids oxygen uptake and endurance, and several athletes in various international sports have already been caught using it since it was banned on Jan. 1. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images

Haggerty said ""Maria at all times took the mildronate in accordance with the recommendations of her doctor."" He repeatedly declined to go into specifics about Sharapova's treatment, claiming he had to adhere to the ""strict confidentiality"" of the International Tennis Federation's process.

An ITF spokesman told The Associated Press, however, that the organization places no restrictions on what players and their representatives can say publicly about an ongoing case.

Sharapova said Monday she failed a doping test at the Australian Open in January for meldonium, which became a banned substance under the World Anti-Doping Agency code this year. Meldonium is a heart medicine which improves blood flow and is little-known in the U.S., but it was once common in the Soviet military.

Sharapova said she had taken meldonium for a decade following various health problems including regular sicknesses, early signs of diabetes and ""irregular"" results from echocardiography exams.

""I was first given the substance back in 2006. I had several health issues going on at the time,"" she said.

The drug's inventor, Ivars Kalvins, told Latvian newspaper Diena in a 2009 interview that meldonium was given to soldiers during the 1980s, when Soviet forces were fighting in Afghanistan.

""High altitudes. Oxygen deprivation. If they have to run 20 kilometers with all the gear, at the end they would get ischemia [a blood circulation condition],"" Kalvins was quoted as saying.

""They were all given meldonium. They themselves were not aware they were using it. No one was being asked [if they agree to it] back then.""

Kalvins said meldonium was ""not doping,"" adding that it ""allows you to withstand more physical pressure, but the body still spends its spare reserves.""

Haggerty responded Tuesday to reports that the drug should be taken only for four to six weeks, while Sharapova had said she had been taking it for 10 years. He said Kalvins ""said the treatment is four to six weeks, two to three times a year or as recommended by doctors. Maria always took it in coordination with the recommendation of her doctors. She did not take it every day for 10 years, that's simply not the case.''

He also said that in addition to her having a family history of diabetes and low magnesium levels, Sharapova also took the drug because of abnormal EKG results.

Meldonium was banned because it aids oxygen uptake and endurance, and several athletes in various international sports have already been caught using it since it was banned on Jan. 1.

The wave of meldonium cases has echoes of a doping scandal involving another Soviet military drug, bromantan, which was banned after being found in Russian athletes' samples at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.

While Grindeks has previously stated that meldonium can provide an ""improvement of work capacity of healthy people at physical and mental overloads and during rehabilitation period,"" the Latvian company said Tuesday that it believed the substance would not enhance athletes' performance in competition and might even do the opposite.

""It would be reasonable to recommend them to use meldonium as a cell protector to avoid heart failure or muscle damage in case of unwanted overload,"" the company said.

Grindeks said that, in sports activity, the drug slows down how the body breaks down fatty acids to produce energy.

Haggerty said that the inventor of the medicine ""doesn't see the performance-enhancing nature of it and doesn't believe athletes should be prevented from taking it.""

As far as any public speculation that Sharapova did not need the medicine, Haggerty said, ""They don't have all the facts, all the records, all the tests. They are a little bit in the dark.''

Grindeks did not comment when asked whether someone with the symptoms Sharapova described would be a suitable patient for meldonium. The company said it was designed for patients with chronic heart and circulation conditions, those recovering from illness or injury and people suffering with ""reduced working capacity, physical and psycho-emotional overload.""

Meldonium is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

While meldonium was put on banned list as of Jan. 1, the decision to ban it had been announced by WADA and sports organizations as early as September 2015. Sharapova said she received an email with information on the changes in December, but did not read the information at the time.

The AP was able to buy vials and tablets of meldonium over the counter in Moscow on Tuesday. Accompanying documentation stated that side effects could include blood pressure changes, irregular heartbeat and skin conditions.

German anti-doping expert Mario Thevis, who helped to develop the test for meldonium, told the AP that testing was reliable despite meldonium's recent addition to the WADA banned list.

""There is a potential of the substance to enhance performance and it has been described as a means to facilitate recovery and to enhance physical as well as mental workload capabilities,"" Thevis, a professor at the anti-doping laboratory in Cologne, Germany, said in a telephone interview. ""It can be tested as reliably as any other doping agent.""

According to Haggerty, Sharapova will be provisionally suspended as of March 12. For how long remains to be seen, while Haggerty said the date for hearings and a possible appeal has not been set yet.

The Turkish Athletic Federation said Monday that the IAAF has asked Bulut to submit her defense over irregularities in her biological passport, which monitors an athlete's blood profile over time for signs of doping.

According to Turkey's NTV television, the IAAF found abnormalities in Bulut's blood samples from 2011, 2012 and 2013, and the 23-year-old runner is suspended pending the investigation.

""The IAAF is not making any comment on doping matters under investigations or under result management procedure,"" the global body said in a statement to The Associated Press.

Bulut finished second in the 1,500 at the London Olympics behind fellow Turkish runner Asli Cakir Alptekin, who has been stripped of her gold medal and is serving an eight-year doping ban.

Bulut had been in line to be upgraded to gold but is now the fifth athlete from the Olympic final to face doping allegations. Her silver medal could be at risk.

As well as Alptekin, Natalia Kareiva of Belarus and Russian athlete Yekaterina Kostetskaya, who finished seventh and ninth, respectively, have since been banned for biological passport abnormalities.

Abeba Aregawi, who finished fifth in London, was suspended last week pending an investigation after testing positive for a banned substance. Aregawi, the 2013 world champion, was born in Ethiopia but now represents Sweden.

Russia's Tatyana Tomashova, who finished fourth in London, had served a previous doping ban.

After learning of the Bulut investigation, U.S. runner Shannon Rowbury -- who placed sixth in London -- said she finished second among athletes who have not tested positive during their careers.

Rowbury issued a statement on the social video platform Unscriptd and posted on YouTube.

""While those women were doing their victory lap in the London Olympic stadium, I was crying through my cooldown and then sobbing .... trying to gather enough self-control to face my family with a smile and tell them that I was fine,"" she said. ""These cheaters rob people like me and my competitors of medals.""

""This news has left me feeling validated that my best is and can be enough,"" Rowbury added.",[]

espn.com,,Browne preparing hard for Chagaev shot,['Dan Rafael'],"Heavyweight Lucas ""Big Daddy"" Browne's aim to is to become the first Australian to win a heavyweight title, and to listen to him, it's clear he is cutting no corners as he prepares for his opportunity.

He will get his chance against secondary titleholder Ruslan Chagaev on March 5 (AWE) at Akhmat Arena in Grozny, Russia.

""I've never sparred better than this,"" Browne said after a recent sparring session that was open to the media. ""I'm so pumped for this fight that I've been able to blast my way through each session. Nothing will stop me from winning the WBA [regular] world title. I'm going to bring my own brand of violence into the ring versus Chagaev and won't stop until he's out. I've never liked going to the judges because when you knock someone out there can be no discussion as to who won the fight.""

Browne has been the mandatory challenger since last February but has had to wait for the shot because Chagaev was due to face Fres Oquendo in a rematch in October in Kiel, Germany. But when Oquendo suffered a serious shoulder injury two weeks before the fight, it was called off, and the door opened for Browne to get the next shot at Chagaev, who holds a second-tier belt to world champion Tyson Fury.

Whatever the status of the belt he is fighting for, Browne said he will be ready.

""I think people are going to be surprised when I turn up in such tremendous shape and I'm going to do things in there that people haven't really seen me do before,"" Browne said. ""I've been getting some great advice from the likes of Larry Holmes, Joe Bugner, Riddick Bowe and Hasim Rahman. Having all their support really boosts me. I'm ready to be Australia's first world heavyweight champion.""

While awaiting the title fight, Browne (23-0, 20 KOs), 36, who is promoted by former two-division world titleholder Ricky Hatton, fought only once in 2015, scoring a ninth-round knockout of journeyman Julius Long in August. But manager Matt Clark said he has made up for the inactivity with hard work in training.

""In the past, Lucas has had to go easy on sparring partners because it's really hard to get decent sparring in Australia,"" Clark said. ""This time, specific sparring has been brought in and Lucas hasn't had to hold back. At times, it has been absolutely brutal. Lucas is at a career-best weight. His preparation has been perfect. He's focused on Chagaev and he's being very destructive in the gym. All his hard work is going to pay off.""

Chagaev (34-2-1, 21 KOs), 37, a native of Uzbekistan who is living in Germany, will be defending his belt for the second time. He scored a controversial majority decision win against Oquendo to claim the vacant belt in July 2014 in Grozny and then was idle for a year until making a defense on July 11, knocking out Francesco Pianeta in the first round, in Magdeburg, Germany.",[]

Abril (19-3-1, 8 KOs), 33, a native Cuban fighting out of Miami, has not fought since September 2014 because of a combination of promotional and managerial issues as well as a bout of dengue fever that forced him to twice pull out of title defenses in 2015. Eventually, Abril was stripped of his belt thanks to inactivity.

Abril, a defensive-minded boxer, retained his 135-pound belt twice, decisions against Sharif Bogere in March 2013 and Edis Tatli in September 2014.

DiBella is well aware of Abrils reputation as a boring fighter and said he would match him with somebody who would bring out the best in him.

Im going to put him in against a guy who will come forward, DiBella said. Abril has skills. After the fight in May, then Ill throw him to the wolves. Theres no babying. He knows that.

Wawrinka, seeded second, had been two points from defeat in the Dubai tournament's first round to Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine.

This is the third time that Wawrinka has played in Dubai. In his previous two visits, the Swiss star never won a match.

Baghdatis, who was unseeded, has now lost his last seven finals.

Wawrinka, who has beaten Baghdatis all six times they've played, broke serve on a fifth set point in the 10th game to close out the first set. Baghdatis double-faulted three times in that game, including the final point.

It's refreshing in this world of nervous, reactive NFL front offices to see a team operate as fearlessly and successfully as the Denver Broncos have with John Elway as general manager.

Watching projected starting quarterback Brock Osweiler leave for the Houston Texans on the first day of free agency Wednesday was the latest headline-grabbing development reflecting the security Elway enjoys as a Broncos legend with Super Bowl rings on his fingers. It should come as no surprise the Broncos refused to keep their projected starting quarterback at all costs.

Elway cast aside Tim Tebow amid an outcry. Elway fired coach John Fox following four consecutive AFC West titles. Elway forced Peyton Manning into an awkward contract renegotiation, one of several moves informing Manning he was about to live life on the team's terms. Every one of these moves seemed risky from a public-relations standpoint. Every one worked out well for the organization.

The Broncos' decision to bench Osweiler for the playoffs complicated their negotiations with him, but in the end, Denver simply wasn't willing to pay keep-him-off-the-market money for a quarterback who had not played especially well when given an opportunity to start. Denver could be taking less risk than the Texans are taking even though most would regard the Broncos' situation -- no starter on the roster! -- as the ultimate NFL horror.

Osweiler finished the 2015 season with an 86.4 passer rating (25th) and a 59.6 Total QBR score (24th). Texans starter Brian Hoyer was actually better in both categories, but because he bombed in the playoffs against Kansas City, keeping him in place as the starter became politically untenable for Texans leadership. The Texans previously passed up two chances to draft Derek Carr, purportedly because David Carr's struggles as a Texan made selecting Derek Carr politically untenable. Houston previously replaced Ryan Fitzpatrick with Hoyer, a lateral move at best.",[]

In a strange twist of events, thanks to his somewhat modest numbers of laps led and fastest laps run, Keselowski was fourth in DraftKings daily fantasy points at Las Vegas behind the drivers that finished second (Joey Logano, 79.5), third (Jimmie Johnson, 86.5) and fourth (Kyle Busch, 75).

Last week in this space, I said to start your team with Kevin Harvick, who finished seventh both in the race and in fantasy points. For the post-qualifying preview, I moved him to the second-best high-cost driver behind Jimmie Johnson.

I also said stay away from Denny Hamlin, Kyle Larson and Aric Almirola, Those guys ended up with a combined 15 points. That leads me to feel good about myself on a Monday afternoon, and that's before my pre-article latte.

Create up to 10 brackets and compete against ESPN talent, professional athletes, and celebrities for all the bracket glory! Play Now

Before I get into Phoenix (I'll meander there eventually), something that has caught my eye this year is the performance of the rookies. Chase Elliott and Ryan Blaney are young, talented and inconsistent.

Elliott, after putting up 60 points for an eighth-place finish at Atlanta, wrecked late and came up with minus-16 points. He has been in the negative for two of three races this season, but has run well in all three.

Blaney, after averaging 16.5 DraftKings points and a 22nd-place finish the first two races of the season, finished sixth for 51 points at Las Vegas. And that was just for $6,600, making him a super bargain.

These drivers' costs haven't quite caught up to ability, so it can really open up your roster if you get on board. However, they're still rookies, and the possibility of a poor finish could ruin your day. Decisions, decisions.

Now, let's look ahead to Phoenix, as NASCAR continues its West Coast swing. This is a different track than the ones we've seen this year, a fairly flat, one-mile course.

I'm looking for a driver to dominate here. In 20 of the past 22 Phoenix races, a driver broke the 100-fantasy points mark. In three of the past four, a driver broke the 150-point mark.

Here are five drivers I'm looking to either dominate or just put up a solid score for you this weekend. Check back again later this week for the final picks and fades.

I'm starting my team with:

Remember that stat about how three of thepast four Phoenix races have seen a driver crack the 150-fantasy points barrier? All three of those races have come from Kevin Harvick. And Harvick has won four of the past five Phoenix races, and has finished in the top two in seven of the past eight.

Over the past four years at Phoenix, Harvick has averaged 113.1 DraftKings points per race; the second-best is 60.5. He has averaged 128.5 laps led; the second-best is 41.4. This pick is as easy as I'll make all season. Regardless of Harvick's salary, unless the practices and qualifying scream otherwise, I'm starting with Harvick.

Keep an eye on these four:

Brad Keselowski: Nobody's going to even come close to replicating Harvick's Phoenix production, but Keselowski is a good place to start your roster if you want to play counter to the field and leave Harvick off. Keselowski has finished no worse than 11th in the past eight Phoenix races, and has double-digit fastest laps in each one. While Keselowski has never won at Phoenix, he won on a pair of shorter, flatter tracks in 2014 at Richmond and New Hampshire.

Jamie McMurray: On, shorter, flat tracks (Phoenix, New Hampshire, Richmond and Martinsville), McMurray has done his best work. In 16 races on those tracks over 2014-15, he had only two finishes worse than 16th. The only fantasy issue with McMurray is he tends to qualify well on these tracks. So even those he has good finishes, his combined start/finish differential in these races is minus-32.

Ryan Newman: Newman is a generally solid but unspectacular. What does that mean? In the past 25 races dating back to last year, Newman has only twice failed to finish in the top 20. But in that span, he has one top-five finish, and two finishes better than 10th. He has been a tick better than his average at Phoenix, finishing 11th or better in his past five races there, putting up no fewer than 44 points in any race. Don't count on big laps led or fastest laps bonuses, which means the start/finish differential looms even bigger.

Ty Dillon: Dillon will be making his second Cup Series start at Phoenix, he put up a mild 16 fantasy points in the fall 2014 race there. But I'm looking at how successful he has been there in the second-tier Xfinity Series, with a top-10 finish in all four starts, with a fourth, sixth and fifth in his past three races. Dillon will be in Stewart-Haas Racing's No. 14 car, so he'll have good equipment, and will likely be available at a low price.

That's all I have for you this week. Check back over the weekend, and enjoy a refreshing burrito in the meantime.",[]

And how does Adam Scott balance back-to-back victories while still striving for another green jacket at the Masters? He spoke to ESPN.com's Michael Collins after his win at Doral. (2:19)

Pop quiz: At the 2008 U.S. Open, the USGA paired the top three players from the Official World Golf Rankings together for the first two rounds. Who were they?

Answer: Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Adam Scott.

With all of the recent talk about the new ""Big Three"" being Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Jason Day, how is it we're just starting to turn our attention to a former world No. 1 who has already made a compelling argument for Comeback Player of the Year, if they still had one?

How is it that someone whom we see as being blessed with so many appealing qualities has had to be so resilient?

If you were to design what the perfect golfer looks like, you would probably sketch out Adam Scott. Tall, strong, athletic. But the most important part of the total package is about what we don't see on the outside. It is what is defined as resiliency.

Editor's Picks Lucky breaks fall Adam Scott's way in Doral victory Adam Scott isn't naive enough to think he deserved the fortuitous bounces that helped him win the WGC-Cadillac Championship. He does, however, realize that luck played a part.

Four-Ball: Scott firmly at head of Masters class So how should the 2013 green jacket winner deal with the role of Masters favorite? Our experts share varied ideas about the best way to go about preparing for Augusta.

Bowditch shoots 37 over, worst WGC score ever Steven Bowditch shot 84 on Sunday to finish the Cadillac Championship at Doral at 37 over, which is the highest score ever in a World Golf Championships event. 2 Related

This is an athlete who for the first year since turning professional in 2000, went winless in 2015. For many, Scott had stopped being part of the current golf conversation. A guy who spent 11 weeks as the best player in the world less than two years ago was an afterthought to many. He was a guy, because of a worldwide rules change, that was being forced to adopt a new method of play that many said would end his career.

That epitaph was just a bit premature to say the least.

The resiliency of Scott isn't just about the short term of the past two weeks, during which he won the Honda Classic despite making a quadruple-bogey late in the third round and two double-bogeys in the final round of his victory at Doral. It is about the longer term. It is about a player needing a captain's pick by fellow Aussie Greg Norman just to make the 2009 Presidents Cup team for the International side. It is about making a major coaching change that same year and bottoming out as the 76th-ranked player in the world. It is about switching putting methods to the broomstick and becoming a major champion and then having to completely reevaluate and change putting methods again.

Being the best at anything is difficult, but rebuilding that ascendancy after the pieces have crumbled is even more difficult.

I was there in 1996 after having been the best player in the world in 1992. Bit by bit, it all fell apart both personally and professionally.

The bottom came for me at the U.S. Women's Open at Pine Needles. With a coaching change that was not working and a new set of clubs that was a poor fit (as I tried to keep a long running manufacturing relationship intact), I missed the cut convincingly. I remember walking down the 17th hole on Friday realizing that not only was I going to miss the cut in the championship that meant the most to me, I didn't even have a way to get home, a four-hour drive away.

I had to wait overnight for my mom to come pick me and my dog up, but in the meantime, the resilience started to kick in and the pieces of the puzzle reassembled. The clubs were ditched as soon as I got home; a tried-and-true set put back in the bag. I then withdrew from the next two events, went back to my previous teacher, looked at old films and old photos and then returned to the range for two-a-day sessions. Blisters and Band-Aids galore.

Adam Scott shanked this bunker shot on the 16th hole during the final round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship but didn't let it get to him. He calmly chipped up and still made par on the drivable par-4 to maintain his lead at Doral. David Cannon/Getty Images

Late afternoons were spent playing alone, back to my favorite times as a kid when it was just me and the game, trying figure out how to get the ball in the hole as fast as possible -- and then doing it all over again.

It was about reevaluating a plan for the rest of the season, remembering how much I just loved to play, compete and win. It was about getting back to the basics of what makes you tick. When I went back on tour, I won the next two events and four in total by the early fall. It wasn't about what my ball-striking, sand save or putting numbers said, it was about resiliency, about a plan and about having the belief to put it in motion.

Adam's Scott's stats might tell you that he leads the tour in ball-striking. He's jumped 115 spots in the putting rankings, but sits 136th in sand saves. What those numbers can't tell you is the clarity and freedom that comes from family sit-downs, mapping out a plan and a peaceful mind in the midst of the chaos that is just part of being a professional athlete. It's about digging deep, about doing what you love and appreciating it.

Let's take time to appreciate Adam's Scott career in total -- even if we continue to have the current ""Big Three"" or ""Big Four"" conversations -- because this comeback and the resiliency he has shown is truly big time.",[]

AFC East | AFC North | AFC South | AFC West

NFC East | NFC North | NFC South | NFC West

AFC EAST

Linebacker Bryce Paup

There isn't one obvious candidate here, and I considered linebackers London Fletcher and Takeo Spikes, kicker Rian Lindell and others. But my choice is Paup, whom the Bills signed in 1995 to what was then an expensive deal -- three years, $7.6 million -- and he delivered, recording 17.5 sacks as the NFL's defensive player of the year. At least in this case, big spending in free agency yielded the Bills instant impact. -- Mike Rodak

Defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh

This would have been a no-brainer if the Dolphins closed the deal on future Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees, who was close to signing in 2006 before the team had injury concerns. Instead, the pick is Suh, who signed a franchise-record $114 million contract in 2015 and is in his prime. Suh projects to have a long, dominant tenure with the Dolphins. -- James Walker

Linebacker Mike Vrabel

When the Patriots signed Vrabel from the Steelers in 2001, it hardly registered on the New England radar because he wasn't a front-line player in Pittsburgh. Eight seasons later, he was an instrumental part of three Super Bowl championship teams in New England, playing the linebacker position at a high level and chipping in as a goal-line tight end with a knack for catching touchdowns. -- Mike Reiss

Running back Curtis Martin

The Jets pulled a free-agent coup in 1998, when they swiped Martin from the Patriots. The Bill Parcells-led Jets cooked up an offer sheet filled with poison pills, causing the Patriots to relinquish their rights to Martin. The Jets had to give up first- and third-round picks as compensation, but it was a franchise-altering move as Martin went on to a Hall of Fame career. -- Rich Cimini

AFC NORTH

Defensive back Rod Woodson

The Ravens have signed plenty of big-name players over the years, but Woodson was the first. Convincing the long-time Steelers great to sign with Baltimore in 1998 truly legitimized the fledgling Ravens. He also became a mentor to Ray Lewis and the experienced voice of one of the most dominant defenses in NFL history. The others in the running were Shannon Sharpe, Sam Adams, Michael McCrary, Derrick Mason, Anquan Boldin and Jacoby Jones. -- Jamison Hensley

Cornerback Adam Jones

Free agency is an event in which the Bengals have largely avoided participating, but they have made some key acquisitions through it over the years. Jim Breech and James Brooks are among the best signings Cincinnati had in the 1980s. Both players were part of Super Bowl teams. But a case could be made that Jones was the Bengals' best free-agent signing ever. He came to Cincinnati with tremendous value, having missed parts of two seasons due to suspensions and other time due to injuries. The time away from football has led to the now-32-year-old being so fresh in his older age that he just went to the Pro Bowl for the first time. The Bengals have been to the playoffs all but one season in which Jones has played for them. -- Coley Harvey

Cornerback Frank Minnifield

OK, this may be a stretch, but in 1984, Minnifield got his release from the USFL and became an NFL free agent. He signed with the Browns and joined Hanford Dixon to form one of the top cornerback combinations in the league. Dixon and Minnifield developed the entire ""Dawgs"" theme, which led to the Dawg Pound, the bleachers in old Cleveland Stadium. -- Pat McManamon

Linebacker James Farrior

Kevin Greene, Jeff Hartings and Ryan Clark deserve consideration here, but Farrior was an emotional touchstone for two Super Bowl-winning teams. The Steelers signed Farrior, a former New York Jet, in 2001, and Farrior rewarded the faith with more than 700 tackles, the only Steeler to surpass that threshold. In 2004, Farrior earned All-Pro and Defensive Player of the Year runner-up honors. He played big in big games, notching 2.5 sacks in the Steelers' upset of Indianapolis in the 2005 playoffs. -- Jeremy Fowler

AFC SOUTH

Cornerback Johnathan Joseph

In 2011, the Texans needed help defensively and went out to get it. They got a new defensive coordinator in Wade Phillips and signed two defensive backs -- notably Joseph, who signed a five-year deal worth $48.75 million after beginning his career with the Bengals. Joseph has been worth every penny. He helped the Texans turn around their defense and has anchored their defensive backfield ever since. Last summer, the Texans gave him a contract extension with an eye toward keeping Joseph in Houston for the rest of his career. He had a strong season in 2015 while also mentoring rookie cornerback Kevin Johnson. -- Tania Ganguli

Safety Mike Adams

Colts general manager Ryan Grigson has swung and missed on many free agents, and former GM Bill Polian was relatively conservative when it came to signing free agents on the outside. But Grigson got it right when he signed Adams in the middle of June 2014. Adams has 10 interceptions, five forced fumbles, a touchdown, 162 tackles, and he has made the Pro Bowl in both of his seasons with the Colts. -- Mike Wells

Wide receiver Keenan McCardell

McCardell joined the Jaguars after five seasons in Washington and Cleveland, and he went on to catch 499 passes for 6,393 yards and 30 touchdowns, all of which rank second on the team's all-time lists behind only Jimmy Smith. McCardell spent six seasons in Jacksonville and partnered with Smith to give the Jaguars one of the NFL's top receiver duos. He made one Pro Bowl with the Jaguars (1996). -- Mike DiRocco

Quarterback Warren Moon

In 1984, the Houston Oilers signed Moon, a five-time CFL Grey Cup-winning QB, and found a Hall of Famer. In 10 seasons with the Oilers, he completed 57.9 percent of his passes for 33,685 yards, 196 touchdowns and 166 interceptions. The circumstances of his arrival were unusual, but Moon ranks as one of the top free-agent additions in NFL history. -- Paul Kuharsky

AFC WEST

Quarterback Peyton Manning

Manning's arrival in 2012 has resulted in four AFC West titles and two Super Bowl trips. Along the way, the Broncos have won 50 regular-season games, set the league's single-season scoring record in 2013 (606 points) and Manning added several NFL records to his already clogged resume, including career touchdown passes and single-season touchdown passes. -- Jeff Legwold

Running back Priest Holmes

The Chiefs took a chance in 2001 on Holmes, who had been mostly a backup in his first four NFL seasons with the Ravens. Holmes worked out for the Chiefs better than they had hoped. He finished after the 2007 season as the team's all-time leading rusher, though his record has since been broken by Jamaal Charles. Holmes also set an NFL record for rushing touchdowns in 2003, though that mark has also been broken. -- Adam Teicher

Quarterback Jim Plunkett

Long an island of misfit toys who could not get along in other locales, Oakland might be synonymous with second chances. But let's go with the most important position in team sports -- quarterback -- and while Rich Gannon won a league MVP in 2002 and took his team to the Super Bowl, Plunkett, who contemplated retirement after flameouts in New England and San Francisco, is the NFL's ultimate Lazarus tale. He helped lead the Raiders to two of their three Lombardi Trophies. Plunkett it is, then. -- Paul Gutierrez

Linebacker Donnie Edwards

Edwards returned to his hometown in free agency in 2002 after starting his NFL career with the Chiefs. Edwards, who grew up south of San Diego in Chula Vista, finished with at least 100 tackles in four of his five seasons with the Chargers and earned a Pro Bowl invitation in 2002. Edwards also helped lead the Chargers to a franchise-best 14-2 record in 2006. He is a part of the NFL's exclusive 20-20 club, with 28 interceptions and 23.5 sacks in a 13-year pro career.-- Eric D. Williams

NFC EAST

Cornerback Deion Sanders

The Cowboys altered the balance in the NFC when they signed Sanders as a free agent in 1995 away from the 49ers. Sanders signed a seven-year, $35 million deal and helped the Cowboys win Super Bowl XXX and that was in just nine games. He played just one full season and intercepted 14 passes in his five years with the Cowboys. La'Roi Glover might have been a better value signing, considering price and four Pro Bowls, but Sanders brought a ring and that trumps all. -- Todd Archer

Wide receiver Plaxico Burress

Burress signed a six-year, $26 million contract with the Giants in 2005. During his four years with the Giants, they went 41-23, made the playoffs all four years and won the Super Bowl once. (They've made the playoffs only once since.) Burress was the missing piece for the team's passing game -- a true, elite, game-breaking wide receiver the likes of which they didn't have until Odell Beckham Jr. came along. Burress will always be remembered for the disappointing way in which his Giants career ended, when he shot himself in the leg in a New York City nightclub toward the tail end of the team's extremely promising 2008 season. And that ending is why guys like Antonio Pierce and Antrel Rolle were considered for this spot. But Burress' impact on the Giants was undeniable, and for four years, they got more than they could have ever expected from him. -- Dan Graziano

Offensive tackle Jon Runyan

Runyan signed a free-agent deal with the Eagles in 2000. They went to the playoffs that season. They played in the NFC Championship Game five times during Runyan's nine years and made it to one Super Bowl. He never missed a game. The Eagles had some good free-agent signings -- Ricky Watters, Troy Vincent, Jevon Kearse, Connor Barwin, Malcolm Jenkins -- but Runyan stands above them all. -- Phil Sheridan

Linebacker London Fletcher

Fletcher signed with Washington in 2007, an undersized standout who was past his prime -- he was 31 when he signed. But Fletcher spent seven seasons with the Redskins, earning four trips to the Pro Bowl and became the leader of the defense. Current receiver Pierre Garcon was another good signing, but Fletcher tops the list. -- John Keim

NFC NORTH

Defensive end Julius Peppers

The Bears invested wisely in Peppers in the spring of 2010. Although he cost the Bears $42 million guaranteed over the first three seasons of his six-year mega-contract, the veteran pass-rusher notched 37.5 sacks and three Pro Bowl berths from 2010-13. Peppers played a huge part in the Bears' 2010 NFC North division championship, helping anchor a defense that ranked ninth overall and fourth in points allowed. The Bears released Peppers for salary-cap reasons after 2014, but the freakishly athletic defender proved he had plenty left in the tank, sacking the quarterback 21 times (including the postseason) for arch-rival Green Bay. -- Jeff Dickerson

Cornerback Dre Bly

This was a surprisingly difficult call. Reggie Bush had an impact in league perception for potential big-name players to come to Detroit. Glover Quin and Golden Tate have made massive impacts and each made one Pro Bowl. But Bly was probably the best free-agent signing in Lions history. He was a Pro Bowler his first two seasons with Detroit and started 54 games for the Lions, intercepting 19 passes and returning two of them for touchdowns. He is the last Lions cornerback to make the Pro Bowl and is the only Detroit defensive back to make multiple Pro Bowls since Dick LeBeau from 1964 to 1966. -- Michael Rothstein

Defensive end Reggie White

When Ron Wolf became the Packers' general manager in 1991, he said people around the league told him he'd never get players to come to Green Bay. He said at the time it was known as ""the Siberia of the NFL."" Signing White in 1993 changed all that. It's arguably the biggest free-agent signing in NFL history, not just in Packers history. Former Packers president Bob Harlan has often said there were four people most responsible for resurrecting the Packers in the 1990s: Brett Favre, Mike Holmgren, Wolf and White. -- Rob Demovsky

Cornerback Antoine Winfield and nose tackle Pat Williams

With all due respect to Brett Favre, who took the Vikings on quite the ride in 2009, Winfield and Williams each went to three Pro Bowls with the Vikings and helped turn the team's defenses of the late 2000s into one of the best in the league. Winfield played nine seasons with the team before the Vikings cut him, and nearly returned for a 10th when then-coach Leslie Frazier campaigned to bring him back in 2013. -- Ben Goessling

NFC SOUTH

Running back Michael Turner

After serving as LaDainian Tomlinson's backup in San Diego, Turner signed with the Falcons in 2008 and made an immediate impact. He was the league's second-leading rusher behind Adrian Peterson in '08, amassing 1,699 yards on 376 carries with a franchise single-season record 17 rushing touchdowns. Turner went on to rush for more than 1,000 yards two more times with the Falcons (2010, 2011) while averaging 12 rushing touchdowns per season. Turner averaged 5.8 yards per carry in the 2012 playoffs, when the Falcons made it to the NFC title game. -- Vaughn McClure

Quarterback Jake Delhomme

The Panthers signed the Saints' backup quarterback in 2003, and he nearly led Carolina to a Super Bowl victory that season. He went on to become the team's all-time leader in wins, pass attempts, pass completions, pass yards and passing touchdowns over a seven-year period. He also led Carolina to the 2005 NFC Championship Game and had eight career playoff wins. -- David Newton

Quarterback Drew Brees

This one's a no-brainer. The only question is whether Brees deserves to unseat Reggie White and Deion Sanders, among others, as the greatest free-agent signing in NFL history. Brees came to New Orleans from San Diego after major shoulder surgery in 2006. Not only did he bounce back in remarkable fashion, but he helped resurrect a franchise after four decades of futility, and he helped lift a community in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Brees has posted unprecedented passing numbers over the past decade and earned a Super Bowl MVP award. He will sail into the Hall of Fame. -- Mike Triplett

Defensive end Simeon Rice

Rice signed with the Bucs in 2001 and recorded 11 or more sacks in five of his six seasons in Tampa. He had 15.5 in 2002 and 15 in 2003, which was the season the Bucs won the Super Bowl. Rice was perhaps the league's most feared pass-rusher during his Bucs tenure. -- Mike DiRocco

NFC WEST

Quarterback Kurt Warner

It didn't look like it at first, but the Cardinals signing Warner as a free agent in 2005 would help change the franchise and its public perception. On his second contract with Arizona, signed after that initial season, he went on to lead the Cardinals to their only Super Bowl in 2009. They have yet to return, coming within one game this past season. Despite a rocky start to his tenure in Arizona, Warner gave the Cardinals stability. -- Josh Weinfuss

Offensive guard Adam Timmerman

Free agency hasn't been too kind to the Rams, but they did manage to find a key cog in the Greatest Show on Turf when they signed Timmerman away from Green Bay in 1999. We could cheat and put Kurt Warner here, but this is intended to be signings made in the traditional free-agent period. Timmerman stabilized the interior of that offensive line and helped the offense become one of the most dynamic in league history. -- Nick Wagoner

Linebacker Ken Norton Jr.

In a three-man race between Justin Smith, Deion Sanders and Ken Norton Jr., my first tie-breaker was titles, making it a two-man deal between Sanders and Norton. So longevity won out. Sure, Sanders and Norton were stalwarts on the 1994 Niners, who won their most recent Lombardi Trophy and tipped the league's balance of power back from the Cowboys, but while Sanders high-tailed it to Dallas the next season, Norton stuck around for seven years and never missed a game in San Francisco, starting all 112 games he played for the Niners and leading them in tackles every season. -- Paul Gutierrez

Defensive lineman Michael Bennett

The Seahawks signed him to a one-year, $5 million deal in 2013 and have since extended him. Bennett has 25.5 sacks in the past three seasons and is a disruptive force against the run, constantly making plays in the backfield. With his ability to play defensive end in the Seahawks' base look and inside in nickel, Bennett has provided Pete Carroll's unit with great versatility. He has been a key cog in the front seven for a group that has led the NFL in fewest points allowed for four consecutive seasons. -- Sheil Kapadia",[]

The study is supposed to last 48 hours. Fielder is expected back in camp by the weekend.

The star first baseman and designated hitter had been having problems sleeping since arriving at camp in Arizona.

""I think Prince had gone about his job where I had not noticed a whole lot, but obviously those type of things need to be communicated, which he did. We'll get him checked out and get him right,"" Rangers manager Jeff Banister said.

Banister said Fielder never had those types of sleeping issues while playing in past seasons, ""so I'm sure that's a little bit concerning.""

Fielder has played in four games this spring. He had one hit in nine at-bats with two strikeouts.

Texas assistant general manager Thad Levine said Fielder has been ""feeling symptomatic for a while.""

Levine said that because it's so early in the spring, the Rangers decided to get Fielder evaluated to ""see if we can get him some help.""",[]
espn.com,,Vargas heads into Ali title bout with yet another trainer,['Dan Rafael'],"Former junior welterweight titlist Jessie Vargas has a chance to add a second world title to his collection when he squares off with unbeaten 2008 U.S. Olympian Sadam Ali for a vacant welterweight belt in what many view as a toss-up fight on Saturday night (HBO, 10 p.m. ET/PT) at the DC Armory in Washington, D.C.

In his last outing Vargas came close to a last-second knockout of Timothy Bradley Jr. challenging for his 147-pound belt (which he later vacated) but lost a clear unanimous decision. On that June 27 night at the StubHub Center in Carson, California, future Hall of Famer Erik Morales was in Vargas corner as his trainer for the first time, but he will not be with Vargas on Saturday.

Sadam Ali-Jessie Vargas Where: D.C. Armory in Washington, D.C.

When: Saturday, 10 p.m. ET/PT

TV: HBO

Instead, Dewey Cooper, a retired Las Vegas cruiserweight who went 19-3-3 in his 2001 to 2012 career, trained Vargas for the fight and will man his corner.

There is nothing new about a fighter changing trainers but Vargas has taken it to the extreme. A pro since 2008, Vargas is already on his sixth trainer as he readies to take on Ali (22-0, 13 KOs), 27, of Brooklyn, New York.

Vargas (26-1, 9 KOs), 26, of Las Vegas, has worked with Roger Mayweather, Robert Alcazar, Ismael Salas, Roy Jones Jr., Morales and now has welcomed Cooper to the club. He changes trainers like some fighters change their trunks.

He said he had a good training camp with Cooper and is learning from him.

With him I'm throwing a lot of combinations, setting down on my punches, throwing the punches correctly, Vargas said. Just small things that needed correction and that we are putting together, just going back to the basics.

But whats the deal with six trainers in eight years, especially for such a young fighter? That is highly unusual.

Yeah, it is, Vargas admitted. Situations that I was put in just led me to either split, more than anything, just split. I've learned from each coach, and I have nothing but respect for them. But things are complicated.

What can I say? One trainer (Jones), unfortunately, didn't have the time for my camp. Another trainer (Salas) had to leave to be in training camp with another team while I was in training camp. And others, Robert Alcazar, wanted to do training out of California and I was out of Las Vegas. So it's just different things. With Roger, he was very sick, very ill. I wasn't able to train with him any longer at that time. So it's just the situation that was put in front of me that led me to making a decision of switching up, either me or them. But I've learned from every trainer. I can say that. And I'm learning from Dewey as well. So that's a big benefit.

Vargas said it would, of course, be good to settle into a long-term groove with one trainer to have the continuity in his training camp fight in and fight out.

As an example, Manny Pacquiao has reached wild success with Freddie Roach as his trainer since 2001.

Well, those fighters are fortunate to have that team that would stick with them or that they felt comfortable with, Vargas said. I unfortunately -- not so much unfortunately, because I have learned from everybody, but I haven't been put in that position just yet. Like you said, I'm still young.

So I'm still looking for the trainer that I'm going to settle down with and feel comfortable with. And I'm feeling comfortable with Dewey. I look forward to showing off what we are putting together. He's putting in a great effort and he also wants to bring out the best in me because he had a close relationship with me.",[]

Who is the best fighter regardless of weight class? See ESPN's pound-for-pound rankings. Plus, check out our men's pound-for-pound rankings.

Note: Results through March 9.

= champion

1. Miesha Tate

 Age: 29

 Record: 18-5

 Next: TBD

A long, at times frustrating, path to UFC gold ended in storybook fashion for Tate, as she captured the UFC belt with a win over Holly Holm at UFC 196. There will be those who doubt how long she'll stay at the top. She'll be there ready to prove them wrong.

2. Holly Holm

 Age: 34

 Record: 10-1

 Next: TBD

Holm was likely 90 seconds away from a draw against Miesha Tate, which would have kept her the UFC champion. Instead, she suffers her first loss and the division is thrown into turmoil again. Interest in her rematch with Ronda Rousey remains. Now there's interest in a rematch with Miesha Tate. Big fights still lie ahead for Holm.

3. Ronda Rousey

 Age: 29

 Record: 12-1

 Next: TBD

Rousey falls to the No. 3-ranked bantamweight based on recent results, but she's well-poised to reclaim her throne. She has beaten the current champ, Miesha Tate, twice before. Holly Holm is no longer undefeated. The world awaits for Rousey's next move.

4. Amanda Nunes

 Age: 27

 Record: 11-4

 Next: TBD

Quietly, Nunes keeps racking up wins. She's up to three in a row and whenever she gets a title shot, her resume might surprise those currently sleeping on her. She'll have to continue to wait her turn, but should be dangerous when her number is finally called.

5. Cat Zingano

 Age: 33

 Record: 9-1

 Next: TBD

Zingano has made just one appearance in 2015 (somewhat surprisingly), but to hear her tell it, she's simply getting all her affairs in order before putting together a dominant run. The Colorado native won't need to win too many fights before re-entering title contention.

6. Alexis Davis

 Age: 30

 Record: 17-6

 Next: TBD

We've only seen Davis once since her 16-second loss to Rousey in July 2014, but the result was a good one, as Davis submitted Sarah Kaufman in the second round. Davis will miss an extended period of time, as she's expecting her first child.

7. Sara McMann

 Age: 34

 Record: 8-3

 Next: TBD

No one is about to question this Olympic silver medalist's athletic chops, but three losses in her last four fights have clearly shown McMann is still trying to put everything together in her MMA game. If/when she ever does, there's still loads of potential here.

8. Julianna Pena

 Age: 26

 Record: 7-2

 Next: TBD

Coming off a decisive win against Jessica Eye in October, Pena is poised to live up to the hype that's been building around her name since she won The Ultimate Fighter in 2013. At 26 years old, she has a bright future ahead if she's able to put it all together in the coming years.

9. Jessica Eye

 Age: 29

 Record: 11-3

 Next: TBD

A force to be reckoned with at 125 pounds, Eye's transition to 135 in the UFC has started to go south. She's been competitive in every fight, but her official record has now catered to 1-3 since moving up. If the UFC introduced a flyweight division, Eye wouldn't mind.

10. Liz Carmouche

 Age: 31

 Record: 10-5

 Next: TBD

Carmouche has managed just two wins since debuting with the UFC in February 2013, but her losses during that time have come to stellar competition in Ronda Rousey, Alexis Davis and Miesha Tate. She made only one appearance in 2014 and 2015. An active (and successful) 2016 could have her moving rapidly back up these rankings.",[]
espn.com,,Steven Bowditch shoots 84 at Doral to finish with highest 72-hole score in World Golf Championships history,"['Bob Harig', 'Michael Collins', 'Pa Sport', 'Jason Sobel']","DORAL, Fla. -- Steven Bowditch tapped in for par to end his week at the Cadillac Championship, then walked off the 18th green with a smile as those in the grandstand applauded his effort.

There were four people clapping.

""Hey, it's just golf,"" Bowditch said with a shrug.

Editor's Picks Scott rallies at Cadillac for second straight win Adam Scott made four birdies in his first five holes on the back nine at Doral to help him win the WGC-Cadillac Championship.

Bad golf, but golf nonetheless. Bowditch shot 84 on Sunday, his fourth straight round in the 80s at the Doral event, where there is no cut. He was 37 over for the week, his 72-hole score of 325 the highest ever recorded in a World Golf Championships event. His score was so bad that a young volunteer who was tasked with following Bowditch around with a portable scoreboard was told not to post any numbers, and no one questioned that logic.

""I think there was four dozen golf balls at the start of the week in my locker,"" Bowditch said. ""And I'm down to my last one.""

The Australian's sense of humor was intact, at least.

Bowditch isn't some hack who made the Cadillac field as a fluke. He's a two-time winner in the U.S., a winner of more than $6.6 million in PGA Tour events, a past President's Cup player and came into the week ranked No. 78 in the world.

Of his record-setting 37-over-par performance in the Cadillac Championship, Australian Steven Bowditch remarked, ""Hey, it's just golf."" Drew Hallowell/Getty Images

His week at Doral started with a birdie. Unfortunately for him, there were 71 more holes that turned into a lengthy series of disasters. There was the triple-bogey that capped his opening-round 81, then a combination of a triple-bogey, quadruple-bogey and sextuple-bogey -- that's a 10 on a par-4 -- in his second round on Friday.

For his 36 holes on the weekend, he made more triple-bogeys (three) than birdies (two).

""It's the Blue Monster for a reason,"" Bowditch said. ""I wasn't driving it the greatest here, and it's all over if you can't drive it.""

Quitting, he said, was not a consideration. He could have found a way to withdraw and still picked up a check, but he figured his game needed the work anyway so he kept going.

""I shot 37 over par and still made a paycheck,"" Bowditch said. ""All's not that bad.""

Not a bad paycheck, either. He'll earn $48,000, despite being the first player to shoot four rounds of 80 or more in a PGA Tour event, officials said, since Mike Dunaway posted four consecutive 81s in the 1983 Panasonic Las Vegas Pro-Celebrity Classic -- a five-round event. The previous high score in a WGC stroke-play event was 323, by Huang Ming-jie at Shanghai in 2013.

Painful as it was for Bowditch, at least Sunday's round went quickly.

Playing alone for the second straight day, Bowditch finished his round in 2 hours, 12 minutes. He signed his card, opened a Diet Coke and was thinking about teeing it up in a couple days in Tampa by the time most of the leaders were even warming up for their final rounds at Doral.

""It's the game of golf,"" Bowditch said. ""You don't want to play that way, but it is what it is. No one wants to play that bad, but it's just golf. That's it. I'm out here in one of the biggest events of the year, playing bad -- but I earned my right to be here.""",[]

espn.com,,New Orleans Pelicans grooming Anthony Davis as their closer,['Justin Verrier'],"NEW ORLEANS -- Maybe that tap on the tuchus left a lasting impression.

In Game 6 of the 2010 Western Conference finals, at the height of his tenure as Phoenix Suns head coach, Alvin Gentry watched from feet away as Kobe Bryant took one dribble inside the 3-point arc, unsuccessfully up-faked, then rose up to hoist an impossible fadeaway with Grant Hill blotting him out. As the ball swished through the net, effectively ending the Suns' season, Bryant gave Gentry a firm pat on the rear and took off in the most morose airplane the other way.

Two weeks before, Gentry, despite his strong roots in the Suns' unselfish style, called Bryant the best closer ever.

Gentry's own superstar, Anthony Davis, clearly has a long way to go before reaching such rarefied air. But with the New Orleans Pelicans' playoff odds near the bottom of the league and the injury list growing by the day, Gentry has started to turn an eye toward the future, which includes developing Davis in late-game situations.

""At the end of the game, I think we need to get the ball to Anthony more,"" Gentry said recently. ""We need to start training him to be the guy down the stretch. If you've got a great player, that's what you do.""

Davis has been relatively successful at it this season when they do get it to him. According to NBA.com/Stats, the 22-year-old is averaging 3.0 points in the clutch (final five minutes, score within five points; minimum two games), good for 18th-best in the league and one spot behind Damian Lillard, the once and future prince of bucket-getting. And he stays in that above-average range under the Pu Pu platter of ""clutch"" situations: 2.1 points in a four-point game with three minutes to play (16th-best), 2.3 points in a three-point game with three minutes left (ninth), 1.6 points in a one-point game with three minutes to play (eighth), and so on.

""He is gonna be our closer. And that doesn't necessarily mean making the shot. ... He's gonna be the guy more times than not that we're gonna depend on to make the play at the end of the game."" Alvin Gentry

But defenses are starting to key in on Davis with double teams and extra help defenders, especially in light of his 59-point, 20-rebound career night against Detroit and with the Pelicans now scraping the bottom with their floor-spacers thanks to their rash of injuries. Three of the losses in a recent four-game skid put a spotlight squarely on the offensive struggles down the stretch. And that's where Gentry's definition of being a ""closer"" takes a more modern spin.

""He is gonna be our closer. And that doesn't necessarily mean making the shot,"" Gentry said. ""But I think he's gonna be the guy more times than not that we're gonna depend on to make the play at the end of the game. That means maybe finding the open guy, or when a double team comes being able to swing the basketball and put guys in the position where they can make the shot.

""I think we're gonna have to start trying to go through him -- and it may be a screen-and-roll situation, where he screens and rolls to the basket. But we've got to have him involved in a lot of the plays at the end of the game.""

That's the next frontier for the young superstar. Davis has successfully added a healthy dose of 3-pointers into his diet, with the fourth-year veteran now bombing it from deep 1.7 times a game at a respectable .322 clip. But Davis, once a guard in high school before experiencing a growth spurt that now borders on folk tale, has yet to show he can consistently get others involved. His assist rate has yet to crack double digits, and the 7.6 percent he's dishing out this season ranks sixth-to-last among 71 qualifying power forwards. (Ryan Anderson, for what it's worth, is third-worst.)

This deficiency becomes more evident in the clutch, during which Davis has a minuscule 2.1 assist percentage.

""Of course you want to make your teammates better,"" Davis said. ""Now that teams are starting to throw double teams at me it's becoming a lot easier for me to try to figure out where my teammates are gonna be and try to put them in the right situations to be effective.

""But a lot of teams try to play heads up, but the teams that do [double], that's when those five-, six-, seven-assist game has to come into effect.""

Finding a balance between that guy and being The Guy has been an adjustment. In the game following his domination of the Pistons, Davis finished with nine points on nine shots. He's had 29 points or more three times since, but he needed 13 shots to get to 12 points in a loss to the Rockets, and 31 shots to get to 29 in a loss to Utah Saturday.

""I just always try to make the right play,"" Davis said Monday morning. ""Even since I was in high school, I've never been a selfish guy. Yesterday. ... Not yesterday. Whatever day we had that game. I shot 31 times. And after I looked at it, I said, That's a lot of shots.'

Anthony Davis has yet to show consistently that he can get others involved, particularly late in games. Joe Camporeale/USA TODAY Sports

""But sometimes coach said you're gonna have to shoot that many shots. But I'm always about making the right play, getting my teammates involved. Let them get their share, too. But of course down the stretch, that's when coach wants me to be a little more selfish.""

Luckily, Gentry is sending help at him, too. While the roster has cycled through the four starting spots around Davis, who has been in 22 of the Pelicans' league-high 29 first units, Jrue Holiday, the team's second-best player, has come off the bench. After three months as a reserve, Holiday was bumped up to first chair Monday against the Kings. The result: Eight of Holiday's 10 assists (tied for his second-most on the season) went to Davis in a 115-112 come-from-behind win.

Davis mentioned before the game how crucial the pick-and-roll with Holiday was to their late-game success.

""I think to get in that pick-and-roll with me and Jrue, it's tough. And then you can work from there,"" he said.

Davis played the role of high pick-and-roll screener in four of the eight set offensive possessions the Pelicans had in the final five minutes, with the last one resulting in a Holiday pull-up from 19 feet (with 12.8 seconds left, to Gentry's chagrin) to make it a three-point game.

Individually, Davis finished with four points on 2-for-4 shooting and three rebounds in crunch time.

""We really don't go over it much, because it's the same plays we're going to run throughout the course of the game,"" Davis said of late-game situations. ""You just got to lock in more -- hard cuts, harder screens. That's really it. You don't want to go and practice late-game and end up injuring somebody, because you're trying to set a hard screen or something. ... Except for [Kendrick Perkins].

""Other than that, we just try to lock in more on the offensive end more knowing that we got to get a good look. I think we did that the last three possessions.""

It wasn't all precise execution. Holiday turned it over with 1:43 to play before Dante Cunningham took it back seconds later. DeMarcus Cousins needle-pointed a pass from the high post to Darren Collison for a good look at a reverse layup that would have put the Kings up one with 27 seconds to play, but Collison missed, setting the stage for Holiday's icing pull-up.

But it was a step in the right direction.

""All of these games have been coming down to the last three minutes of the game,"" Davis said. ""And this time, the last three minutes we kind of imposed our will. We were kind of the aggressors. That's usually what happens at the end of games: Whoever's the aggressor usually wins.

""We just felt like we wanted to be aggressive, especially [against] a team that's ahead of us [in the standings] and [we're] trying to catch.""",[]

Following Tuesday's decision by the IOC executive board not to offer opposition, the same set-up is clear to come in for the summer Games in Brazil.

IOC spokesman Mark Adams said: ""AIBA provided medical and technical data that showed the number of concussions is lower without headgear. They have done a lot of research in the last three years. The rule will go ahead for Rio.""

Olympic boxers have been using protective headguards since the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. Women's boxing featured at the Olympics for the first time in London 2012, and female fighters will continue to wear headguards.",[]

As I aged, my morning cereal sickness subsided and my anxiety/anticipation stomach-excitement stew was replaced with deep, cavernous canker sores inside my mouth. A trip to see my college buds, a golf trip, a Florida winter getaway debauchery extravaganza ... whatever it was, a couple of days before the event a canker sore would begin to form and be at its most acute in the middle of said event.

When I was a kid, I would get so nervous when I attended NHL games of my favorite team that I would get nauseous when a) the opposing team entered my team's zone, and b) when the game passed the 10-minute mark of the second period because that meant the game was more than half over.

I can't wait for the 2016 World Cup of Hockey on ESPN this September. No worries, no projectile vomit coming your way, Sparky. Just hockey. To review, here are the basics of the World Cup of Hockey.

ESPN is the home for the World Cup of Hockey. We are all terribly excited, and as we have done during our Frozen Four coverage on ESPN the past two years, I imagine we will break out the old NHL 2Night music for September's World Cup coverage.

This is the third edition of the World Cup of Hockey (1996 and 2004 were the others under this title). This version will have eight teams and will run from Sept. 17 to Oct. 1, with all games taking place at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto. The teams will be separated into two groups and each team will play the other three teams in their respective groups.

Group A

Team Canada

Team Czech Republic

Team Europe (players born outside Czech Republic, Finland, Russia and Sweden)

Team USA

Group B

Team Finland

Team North America (players from Canada and USA who are 23 and under as of Oct. 1, 2016)

Team Russia

Team Sweden

On Wednesday, the preliminary rosters of 16 were named. On June 1, seven more fellas will be added and the rosters will be fully formed: 23 men.

Team North America

The early buzz for the tournament is the 23-and-under team, aka Team North America. Players have to be 23 or younger on Oct. 1. There are some who believe this squad can win it all. I'm not as bullish as that, but the team's speed will be frightening.

Imagine a first line of Connor McDavid, Dylan Larkin and Nathan MacKinnon. Imagine Johnny Gaudreau and Max Domi flanking Ryan Nugent-Hopkins. Imagine Jack Eichel on a wing with fellow wagon Brandon Saad playing with Sean Monahan. And a checking line of Sean Couturier, Boone Jenner and Jonathan Huberdeau. Fun.

Other teams of interest:

USA

USA Hockey is very healthy. The World Cup team will have skill, toughness and experienced scoring. The challenge for Team USA will likely be goal prevention. Can it skate with the fastest teams and play defensively well enough to support its good goalies? The U.S. will probably have to win tight, low-scoring games. It will be playing lightning-fast teams. Can it keep up? Can it defend well enough? Phil Kessel was not on the preliminary roster. We will see whether that inspires him to do something different the rest of this season to impress the U.S. brass.

Russia

The forward filth is frightening: Alex Ovechkin, Evgeni Malkin, Pavel Datsyuk, Vladimir Tarasenko, Artemi Panarin, Evgeny Kuznetsov, Nikita Kucherov and on and on. The defense isn't as stout, so Russia's best defense will be to possess the puck as much as possible. The team has three goalies, Sergei Bobrovsky, Semyon Varlamov and Andrei Vasilevskiy, who are all athletic, and if they are otherworldly, Russia has a chance because of all that skill up front.

Sweden

The Swedes always win the sweater game and they have a great chance for gold. They've got Henrik Lundqvist in net, really good D and plenty of scoring up front.

Canada

This team is the favorite again: home-ice advantage and the best all-around roster. Seven of the Canadians' nine preliminary forwards are centers. You would expect Sidney Crosby, Jonathan Toews, Ryan Getzlaf and Patrice Bergeron to be the centers unless John Tavares cracks that group. Tyler Seguin and Steven Stamkos will be on the wings. Duncan Keith and Drew Doughty are experienced, big-game players on defense. If Carey Price can get 100 percent healthy again, the net will be his.

I could see teammates Seguin and Jamie Benn playing on a line with Crosby. One would think the successful Getzlaf-Corey Perry, Bergeron-Brad Marchand NHL combos would be the kind of built-in symmetry that teams are looking for in tournaments like this.

LONDON -- Paris Saint-Germain have now eliminated Chelsea from the Champions League in consecutive seasons, but there was a distinctly different feel to Wednesday night's victory, compared to their performance at Stamford Bridge 364 days ago.

A year ago, PSG were very much the underdogs: failing to win at home in the first leg (1-1), getting a man sent off early at Stamford Bridge, and twice battling back from behind with set-piece goals to draw 2-2 and advance.

This time, they triumphed relatively comfortably: winning at home, dominating the start of this game, and scoring two well-worked goals with low balls into the box, converted by Adrien Rabiot and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

2-1 at home, 2-1 away. Two slender victories, you could argue, but these scorelines -- combined with the away goals rule -- left Chelsea requiring three goals in the dying minutes to avoid elimination.

Lineups and Stats

Last year, PSG manager Laurent Blanc believed their ""victory"" (actually it was a progression on away goals) marked the moment PSG became a truly elite club. ""PSG want to be one of Europe's top clubs, we want to sit at top table,"" he said at Stamford Bridge afterwards. ""This is a turning point, a reference point in the club's history.""

On Wednesday night, things were more routine. PSG now have the aura of a genuinely big club, as you might expect considering they're currently 23 points clear at the top of Ligue 1, and Blanc was less emotional.

""After the match it's always easy to have a slightly more positive view of the match, but in terms of the result and the game itself, we've gone through,"" said Blanc. ""We were preparing for a tough match. We were right to think Chelsea are a top side. We didn't necessarily think we would be able to put in a good performance away from home, so that's very pleasing. I think we controlled the game from start to finish. When we conceded the goal, we weren't concerned, we continued to play as we had intended.""

PSG boss Laurent Blanc was far more measured after Wednesday's triumph than following last season's progression at Stamford Bridge.

PSG started in control. Some expected them to sit deep and play primarily on the counter-attack, using the pace of Lucas Moura and Angel Di Maria. Instead, their approach was about possession football, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic notably dropping deep to help overload the midfield zone. Di Maria often did similar, with Chelsea creating a 4 v 3 in that zone.

The goal was hardly against the run of play. Ibrahimovic, often frustratingly static in the Champions League, showed good movement throughout the first half, and pulled wide to play a low ball across the six-yard box, converted easily by the onrushing Adrien Rabiot.

This meant PSG had an early away goal, and Chelsea were in a perilous situation. The Blues needed to push forward and get back into the game, certainly, but more importantly they needed to prevent the concession of another away goal.

Chelsea's response was impressive. Guus Hiddink's side didn't push men forward and leave gaps at the back unnecessarily, but there was a notable change in their approach without possession. Having previously concentrated on sitting deep, they now pushed forward and pressed in advanced midfield zones. Thiago Motta, normally such a commanding presence at the base of the PSG midfield, was troubled by this constant pressure and constantly caused turnovers, allowing Chelsea to attack PSG's backline.

""When you analyse, we started too respectfully in the first 10 or 15 minutes on one hand; on the other hand we're playing against a team that knows how to play a short possession game very well, and you have to be careful not to be outplayed in the first part of the game,"" said Hiddink. ""At 1-0 down, we lost this 'wrong' respect, and wanted to defend a bit more fluidly. We got a deserved equaliser and there were more some chances both ways in the first half,"" he added.

Chelsea's midfield pressing here was extremely good, especially as it was somewhat uncharacteristic. Willian, usually praised for his defensive work when tracking opposition full-backs, played an important destructive role from the top of midfield, winning tackles and setting the tone for the pressing.

This suited Cesc Fabregas, too. Motta was booked for fouling Fabregas, then Fabregas was booked for fouling Motta; it was feisty and physical. Chelsea's equaliser, meanwhile, came when Pedro charged inside from the right to dispossess Motta, and then a quick passing combination ended with Diego Costa calmly sliding the ball past PSG goalkeeper Kevin Trapp. Chelsea's approach had worked: Motta, the man meant to be putting PSG in charge, was being overrun, and the absence of the diminutive deep-lying playmaker Blaise Matuidi was particularly obvious.

Adrien Rabiot's early goal gave PSG a lift, but the French champions still had to withstand a Chelsea charge.

Chelsea continued to press at the start of the second half. Rabiot, commanding in possession at times, was also pressed by first John Obi Mikel and then Cesar Azpilicueta, giving away the ball in his own half. PSG were now playing conservatively, retaining the ball and rarely pushing forward.

The next goal was crucial: either Chelsea drew level on the tie, or PSG effectively won the game. Chelsea had chances, most notably when Trapp was forced into a superb double save from Willian and then Eden Hazard. Costa limped off injured, with Bertrand Traore introduced upfront. The Stamford Bridge crowd were preparing for the type of late rally that turned this tie two years ago, when super-sub Demba Ba put them through.

Instead, PSG hit them with a sucker punch.

Motta, so troubled towards the end of the first half, collected a Di Maria pass that Rabiot couldn't quite bring under control, and immediately fired it back towards the left flank for the Argentine. Chelsea right-back Azpilicueta, perhaps expecting a turnover of possession, was caught sleeping, and Di Maria's drilled cross was volleyed into the top of the net by Ibrahimovic. That was that; Chelsea needed three in 23 minutes. It was game over, and while the last two ties between these sides had seen incredible late drama, on this day PSG simply killed the game with unambitious passing.

For now, PSG are yet to better their previous efforts in this competition: they were beaten comprehensively by Barcelona at the quarterfinal stage last season. Anything less than the semifinals this time around will be regarded as a failure -- but on this evidence, PSG are a real contender this time around.

When the day started, there were three teams (Evil Geniuses, Team Secret, and Team Liquid), but in the end it was Team Secret that prevailed among the stacked field at Shanghai.

Lower bracket finals

Team Liquid vs. Evil Geniuses

Team Liquid did its homework. Many of the Evil Geniuses' signature plays, timings, hero selections and even courier movements were well-scouted and countered to perfection. Evil Geniuses seemed to lose composure as the set extended, making many uncharacteristic mistakes which were capitalized on by Team Liquid. The strengths of Evil Geniuses' drafting from Peter ""ppd"" Dager were countered well by Team Liquid's ability to allow comfort picks through to specifically punish them.

The story of Game 1 started with the draft phase -- Team Liquid let the Dark Seer and Enigma slip through and created a split-push lineup to fight against it. As a result, early pickoffs favored Team Liquid, but the force team fights and neutral objectives were all Evil Geniuses. Team Liquid lost nearly every fight and the kill lead reflected it throughout the match, but the split-push trades and backdoor objective control ravaged the Evil Geniuses' base in every attempted push. The end result was a Team Liquid map-controlled victory without a dominating gold lead.

Game 2 was a wash. Evil Geniuses' plan to stall for a fat Naga Siren backfired when Team Liquid drafted in reaction to that with an early game lineup. Team Liquid drafted a Death Prophet and Nature's Prophet for the early power spike and push potential, Nyx Assassin to counter Syed Sumail ""Sumail"" Hassan's Zeus (the hero that needed to stall for Evil Geniuses), and the Ursa for the early objective and team fight control. The fighting started early and often and snowballed the gold lead in favor of Team Liquid, which it never relinquished.

Grand finals

Team Liquid vs. Team Secret

Team Secret had plenty to celebrate after taking down Team Liquid at the Shanghai Major 2016. Tim Franco for ESPN

These two teams met in the upper bracket finals in a rather forgettable set for Team Liquid. Because of those games, the possibility of a rematch was difficult to imagine. However, the theme of this tournament was surprises, and Team Liquid managed to fight through. Team Secret had the best seats in the house for the lower bracket finals and needed a victory to justify the lineup and shut down the doubters.

Game 1 boiled down to Team Liquid's unique hero selection and how it eventually cost them the start of the set. Team Secret squashed every attempt at a fight or gank with superior vision control and rotations from Johan ""PieLieDie"" Astrom and Clement ""Puppey"" Ivanov in the early game. The lack of a win condition for the later parts of the match cost Team Liquid as Team Secret's Aliwi ""w33"" Omar, Jacky ""EternalEnvy"" Mao, and Puppey itemized greedily and fought with superior items and higher net worth. It was over when the lane phase ended in disaster for Team Liquid.

Game 2 was more of the good Team Liquid -- drafting according to counters and outplaying the opponent. The push lineup dictated the pace and any kind of fight or trades in its favor. As with Team Secret all tournament, execution in team fights and defense allowed the game to drag into a stalemate on both sides, but the gold advantage from Team Liquid's great early game still favored them. Lasse ""MATUMBAMAN"" Urpalainen and Adrian ""FATA-"" Trinks were the stars for Team Liquid once again, and they showed up in the late game with their combination of better split push (MATUMBAMAN) or team fight execution (FATA-). The better pushing power of Team Liquid's lineup would prove to be the difference as the team threw bodies and forced fights to absolutely crush the rest of the Team Secret infrastructure.

For Game 3, Team Secret's vaunted lane phase was on full display -- isolation for EternalEnvy's farm, w33's ability to squeeze maximum efficiency at the middle lane, spectacular rotations and ganks from PieLieDie, and the rotations from Puppey. In response, Team Liquid preyed on EternalEnvy's tendency to hunt the jungle as Clinkz by drafting the reactionary Io/Tiny combination and fought around that idea. The issue with planning a fight around Tiny/Io and Tidehunter is that the other team could force fights elsewhere or pick off without a true faceoff. While many other teams in the tournament failed in the ""avoid Tidehunter"" strategy, Team Secret's itemization and execution in the only real fights for Game 3 was flawless. Whether it was EternalEnvy's support-killing build (diffusal blade), Puppey's tank Doom build, or the constant rotations from Rasmus ""Misery"" Filipsen's Nature's Prophet and PieLieDie's Disruptor, it was all Team Secret. In the end, the slippery movements of Team Secret split every fight for full control of the Team Liquid cores and its base.

From the draft, Team Secret was ahead -- comfort signature picks (EternalEnvy on Slark, w33's signature Windranger and PieLieDie on Lion), heroes that go online quickly, and fantastic lane compositions made the analysts doubt the chances of Team Liquid. It showed in the early game with better rotation fights from Puppey and PieLieDie, an isolated EternalEnvy in the safe lane for farm, and Misery's superb micromanagement skills on his Beastmaster for free levels and jungle farm. The end of the early game saw four of Team Secret's heroes atop the net worth charts. The constant motion from EternalEnvy and his advantage as a Slark pushed Team Liquid's entire team behind the safest of locations. The first big fight of the game ended in a four-man wipe from Team Liquid and a 1-13 kill score in favor of Team Secret. Another huge winning fight for Team Secret and the base diving began until Team Liquid finally tapped out.

Team Secret proved that it is a top-tier team once again with a dominant grand finals victory.

If this tournament was any indication, Dota 2 is speeding up. Gone are the farm wars and extended passive play and in are the constant rotations, smoke ganks and earlier fighting itemization. This is the kind of Dota 2 that excites, and it should only get better as the year goes on.",[]
espn.com,,French FA HQ raided in ex-FIFA president Sepp Blatter case,"['Stephan Uersfeld', 'Espn Staff', 'Pa Sport', 'Associated Press']","Sepp Blatter was not surprised with the result of the latest FIFA presidential election.

Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter does his best Arnold Schwarzenegger impression.

Bob Ley reports from Outside the Lines that Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini's bans have been reduced from eight to six years.

Sepp Blatter explains he will not publicly support a candidate in the FIFA presidential election.

BERN, Switzerland -- Swiss authorities say evidence has been seized in a search at the French football federation headquarters for their criminal case against former FIFA president Sepp Blatter.

The office of Switzerland's attorney general says the governing body for French football consented to the search carried out Tuesday with the cooperation of the French Financial Prosecution Office.

Criminal proceedings were opened against Blatter in September for suspected financial mismanagement regarding a 2 million Swiss franc (1.35 million) payment he approved from FIFA funds for Michel Platini in 2011.

""Documents were seized in connection with the suspected payment,"" the Swiss federal prosecution office said in a statement, which detailed a formal request for help from French authorities on Jan. 14.

Blatter and Platini were both banned from football for six years after an investigation by FIFA's ethics committee.

The two both welcomed the investigation and issued separate statements on Wednesday.

""We welcome this new step because as soon as the Swiss justice system has completed its investigation, the sooner Michel Platini will leave the news section [of newspapers] in which he has no place,"" Platini's statement said.

Blatter, who turns 80 on Thursday, denied any wrongdoing.

""I'm very surprised at this for the very simple reason that the two million Swiss francs that FIFA paid to Michel Platini as part of an oral contract that existed between Michel Platini and I were neither transferred to the FFF or to UEFA but to a private account of Michel Platini's in a Swiss bank,"" he said in a statement.

Both men claimed they had a verbal deal for additional salary that Platini would receive for working as Blatter's presidential adviser from 1999 to 2002.

The French federation confirmed that it had cooperated with Swiss authorities and added that the information made available concerned ""documents related to collaborative arrangements between Michel Platini and FIFA during the period of 1998 and 2002.""

Before the payment was revealed in September, Platini had been the leading candidate to succeed Blatter as president in FIFA's emergency election on Feb. 26

The payment emerged during a wider investigation led by Switzerland's attorney general, Michael Lauber, of FIFA business. The investigation includes suspected money laundering in the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bidding contests.

Platini's status in the Swiss investigation is ""between a witness and an accused person,'' Lauber has said.

The case against Blatter also involves alleged misappropriation of FIFA funds during his more than 17 years as FIFA president, which formally ended two weeks ago. Blatter allegedly arranged an undervalued deal for 2010 and 2014 World Cup broadcast rights for the Caribbean with former FIFA vice president Jack Warner.

Platini had previously said he asked Blatter for a salary of 1 million Swiss francs when approached in 1998 to work for the newly elected president.

Blatter said there was a contract for 300,000 Swiss francs, the same salary for FIFA's secretary general at the time, plus a ""gentleman's agreement"" to get the rest later.

Swiss law obliged FIFA only to pay the deferred money within five years. It was not until 2010 that Platini, by then president of the governing body for European football and a FIFA vice president, reportedly asked for the balance, and was paid in February 2011.

That timing has raised suspicion as the payment came during a FIFA presidential election campaign. UEFA later urged its members to support Blatter -- who promised them it would be his final term -- against Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar.

Blatter won that 2011 election unopposed after Bin Hammam was implicated in bribing Caribbean voters. At that point, Platini was the likely successor to lead FIFA.

Instead, Platini's longtime right-hand man at UEFA, general secretary Gianni Infantino, won the FIFA presidential election last month.

espn.com,,CS:GO Top story lines for IEM Katowice,"['Tyler Fionn', 'Tomi Lurppis', 'James Bates', 'Timothy Lee']","While we need to wait roughly a month longer for the next Counter-Strike: Global Offensive major, MLG Columbus, next week's IEM Katowice will be more important than any tournament of the past three months, meaning all 12 teams will do their best to show up in top form. This article takes a look at the key storylines going into the first $250,000 event of 2016.

Can anyone stop fnatic?

The previous fnatic roster, led by Markus ""pronax"" Wallsten, had arguably the most impressive run of any Counter-Strike team in the history of the franchise. Yet after a couple of weaker showings, the squad parted ways with its in-game leader, and brought in Dennis ""dennis"" Edman, former LGB teammate of fnatic's two brightest stars.

Editor's Picks Luminosity - CS:GO's answer to Na`Vi 2010? Luminosity are not a perfect team, but Tomi ""lurppis"" Kovanen sees similarities between them and one of the best 1.6 teams of all time, 2010's Na'Vi.

CS:GO Major visa issues: It's not MLG's fault More visa issues have cropped up, this time hitting the CS:GO scene and their upcoming Major, MLG Columbus. Who's to blame? Not MLG, says Bryce Blum. 1 Related

Since Edman joined, the team has won every tournament it has attended, racking some $350,000 in prize money in just five events. So far fnatic have proved they can outplay every team in the scene, and rarely make enough mistakes to allow others a chance. Yet they have shown weakness by losing multiple maps to EnVyUs, and nearly dropping a game to dignitas at ESL Barcelona.

Fnatic boast the world's best player in Olof ""olofmeister"" Kajbjer, and what they lack in leadership they make up for in pure talent. Beating them through skill does not seem like a viable option, unless you are EnVyUs, which is why the likeliest candidates for upsets are the tactical teams: Natus Vincere, Luminosity and dignitas.

However, even if they go into every playoff series as favorites, simple mathematics say they will eventually lose one. It may not be in Katowice -- though a single best-of-one loss in groups may mean they would need three series wins to win the title -- but I would bet they do not win more than one of the next three big events.

Is the new NiP good enough to contend for titles?

The performance of Ninjas in Pyjamas at IEM Katowice will by no means be the definitive answer to their long-term potential as a team, but it is going to be their offline debut with Jacob ""pyth"" Mourujarvi playing and Bjorn ""THREAT"" Pers coaching. With months of misery nearly forgotten in the NiP camp, it is going to be extremely important for the team to start off on the right foot and gain some confidence going into MLG Columbus.

Online, NiP has had mixed results, but some of the games were played very soon after Pers returned from overseas and started full-time coaching. In addition, considering how vastly experts expect NiP to alter their traditionally very free-wheeling style of play, it is not unlikely that they would have a couple of aces up their sleeves, to be revealed when they are actually playing with glory on the line. Do not expect an entirely new NiP, but Pers is known for having tricky tactics others have not considered.

To make it to the playoffs in Katowice, NiP would need to make top three in a group with fnatic, Na`Vi, Luminosity and mousesports. In other words, for perhaps the first time in history, NiP are favored to go out in the group stage. Making it out of the groups would be impressive, and an indication the 2016 NiP team might be able to contend for titles. But the pressure is on, and odds are, for once, stacked against them.

How will the meta-game evolve?

Often the direction that teams take is massively influenced by the outcomes of big tournaments. While Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has seen a loose, skill-based playing style reign supreme since the game came out, the tactical play of the likes of Na`Vi, Luminosity, and most recently dignitas, has also proved to be effective enough to challenge anyone -- including the teams they cannot match on an individual level.

With fnatic dominating the competitive landscape, a chess-like approach to Counter-Strike is yet to bag a big international tournament. But odds say it will have done that by the time DreamHack Malmo -- the third $250,000 tournament in the next seven weeks -- has finished. Once that happens, some challengers will certainly start copying plays from the more tactical sides, and the meta-game of Counter-Strike will further evolve to a more tactical style of play. Unless fnatic, EnVyUs or Virtus.pro win -- and nothing may change.

Will Luminosity or Na`Vi finally prevail and win it all?

Gabriel ""FalleN"" Toledo and Luminosity will be underdogs against fnatic. Adela Sznajder/DreamHack

Will one of the two most tactical Counter-Strike teams finally put it all together and get over the hump? Both have made the grand final of large tournaments in the past -- including ones with an identical prize purse of $250,000 -- and are now looking to add an actual tournament win to their legacies. And Katowice may be their best chance at it yet.

Every incremental success the two tactical teams have had has added to their experience, and the only team against which one would still consider both of them underdogs is fnatic. As a result, they should have spent some extra time studying fnatic's play, and figuring out ways to beat them -- as any competitor would. They are skilled and tactical enough to beat others when in top shape, and should be armed with new tricks with only fnatic in mind.

I am not sure if either will win in Katowice, but I am willing to bet one of them will have won a tournament by the time IEM Katowice, MLG Columbus and DreamHack Malmo are all over. Their tactical prowess should take them to the semifinals -- unless Na`Vi's group stage struggles rear their ugly head -- and from there on out, the chess masters of each team will determine how far they will go, with an added push from each team's respective star players.

What about EnVyUs and astralis, the other realistic contenders?

EnVyUs has been downright disappointing since winning DreamHack Cluj-Napoca, and their situation does not seem to be improving. Reportedly, some of their players have been struggling with drive since the major, but if that problem were to fix itself, you would have expected it to do so by now; it has been months, after all, and they surely had a break for the holidays. It is unclear if this team will ever be able to fix its issues.

And yet we all jump at the opportunity to watch EnVyUs take on any of the other elite teams, because their peak as a team, when all of their players are at the top of their game individually, is so incredibly high. When Vincent ""Happy"" Schopenhauer's troops are playing their best, it seems no one can match them. They also have defeated this new fnatic squad more often than not (though fnatic remains undefeated in tournaments). Either way, they are a team to watch, because they may break out any moment.

On the other hand, astralis has been slowly improving after an atrocious end to 2015. They finished above EnVyUs at ESL Barcelona, but without ever actually beating the French due to the odd, king of the hill-type format. The team has a superstar player in Nicolai ""device"" Reedtz, and they are somewhat of a mixture between the tactical sides Na`Vi and Luminosity, and the skill-heavy teams fnatic and EnVyUs. At their peak, it seemed as if they had best of both worlds.

The Danes are bound to break through with a strong performance soon, and it is only a question of when it will happen. Regardless of what some fans say, they are a legitimate contender, and capable of beating anyone they might face. It also does not hurt that they are in the easier group -- they only need to defeat FaZe to make the playoffs. Finn ""karrigan"" Andersen's team might again disappoint, but unlike most participants they can actually win. And that is why they are interesting to watch.

Virtus.pro come in as underdogs on their home soil -- can they shock everyone?

Virtus.pro arrived at the top of the scene by winning EMS One Katowice 2014 -- this same event two years ago, when it was backed by Valve. Prior to that, the Poles had not been considered a near-elite level team, and had scored only occasional top finishes at tournaments. And in seemingly a blink of an eye, everything changed as their players leveled up and became the world-beaters they are today, even while they struggle with consistency.

Much like astralis, Virtus.pro's playing style can be dubbed as somewhat of a mixture between tactical and skill-focused play. They are not overly tactical, yet their players are not skilled enough to rely on pure aim. As a result, they rely on teamwork and communication, both of which get massively affected by the amount of preparation they put in -- and what could be more motivating than an event on your home soil, for a team as proud of their country as the Poles?

Janusz ""Snax"" Pogorzelski is the team's only star-level player, but practically any of the other players can take over for a game. For a deep playoff run, Virtus.pro will need the others to give Pogorzelski some real help. That part also correlates with preparation, and while we cannot know how much Filip ""NEO"" Kubski's team is practicing in the final weeks, given their horrible start to 2016, you expect the answer to be a lot. Do not be surprised if Virtus.pro, all of a sudden, look much better than before. Again.

Can any of the underdogs make a name for themselves?

IEM Katowice will have only 12 teams, which means fewer underdogs. In addition, fewer teams will make the playoffs than usual -- only six teams will make the quarterfinals, with group winners advancing directly to the semifinals. But each team is guaranteed five matches, a 150 percent increase over the usual minimum of two-and-out. That means more chances to prove your worth as a team, even if for nothing but ruining someone else's tournament.

This will be especially valuable for the least experienced teams, such as E-Frag, TheMongolz and Tempo Storm. But FaZe and mousesports, neither of whom has done much in the recent months, also benefit from it, because for teams capable of upsetting elite squads at times, more chances are always welcome. Neither is expected to make the playoffs, so the pressure is off -- and that is another thing working in their favor.

Who will break through individually?

The large $250,000 tournaments are often coming-out parties for up-and-coming players. They may have had strong performances online, or even at medium-sized tournaments, but they will not be considered stars before they have delivered at the big events. Odds say someone will do just that at Katowice, especially considering the large groups that will guarantee every team five maps of play -- thus making it easier for newcomers to adjust to the pressure.

Someone to keep an eye on is Tempo Storm's Brazilian AWP star Henrique ""hen1"" Teles, who has been wrecking North American teams in online play. Some of FaZe's near-forgotten players also may resurface at any moment to join Philip ""aizy"" Aistrup at the top of the scoreboard. Other notables include NiP's new recruit Mourujarvi, and mousesports' Johannes ""nex"" Maget, who has struggled for a while now. The point is, no one can know what will happen ahead of time. But expect some unexpected faces to turn heads next week.",[]

Zoro: Takes second place at Gold Series tournament

Name: Hong ""Zoro"" Yije

Team: Team Celestial

Update: Zoro placed second at the Gold Series 2015 Grand Finals, falling to Zhangbo.

Analysis: Zoro had an incredible start to the tournament, topping his portion of the Group Stage event, and advancing to the Round of 16. Here, he had a tough five game series against  but still proved victorious. In the Round of 8, he had a similar fate, winding his way to a critical Game Five matchup against LoveCX. After starting this series down 0-2, he played a slower final three games, winning each of them to secure his spot in the Semifinals. Eager to prove the earlier Playoff matches were flukes, he took a quick series against MagicWind 3-1 with the help of his Warrior, Paladin and Druid decks to advance to the Finals.

Once there, Zoro played well, but not well enough to claim first place. He lost the first game against ZhangBo's Druid, but quickly evened the series in a Warrior mirror matchup. Despite this, ZhangBo was able to take the next game using his Warrior to gain an edge in the series. This pattern continued, with each player trading wins until the final game of the series where Zoro's Paladin was up against ZhangBo's Shaman. Despite getting two extremely early buffed Secretkeepers, Zoro was unable to match the tempo of ZhangBo and was defeated. He finished the Gold Series 2015 Grand Finals in second place.

Dog: Advances to SL i-League Semifinals despite early struggles in Group Stage

Name: David ""Dog"" Caero

Team: Team Liquid

Update: Dog narrowly advanced from the Group Stages, but was able to make a run all the way to the Semifinals of the SL i-League StarSeries Tournament.

Analysis: Dog's tournament start was less than spectacular, narrowly avoiding elimination in the Group Stage. He was only able to win one of his matches, but he still managed to advance due to having a better record than his opponent. Moving into the Playoffs, he matched up against Surrender in a best of five series. He quickly went fell behind 1-2 in the series, but was determined to bring it back.

He brought out his Warlock deck, which he lost with in Game Two, and methodically defeated Surrender's Paladin. In the final matchup of the series Dog used the same strategy, this time using his Warrior deck to defeat the Paladin. Moving into the Semifinals, Dog was matched up against Robin who would go on to win the tournament. Despite being up against such a formidable opponent, he was able to take one game in the best of five, and secured his spot as a Semifinalist finisher.

Kolento: Secures Semifinal finish at SL i-League Tournament

Name: Aleksandr ""Kolento"" Malsh

Team: Cloud9

Update: Kolento topped his group to advance to the Semifinals of the SL i-League StarSeries Tournament.

Analysis: Kolento started off the SL i-League Group Stage with an impressive record. In his matches again Cipher, Dog and Nicolas, he went undefeated to earn himself a bye into the Semifinals. Despite this extremely impressive early showing, he was unable to maintain his momentum in the Playoff stage of the event. In his series against Cipher, he quickly claimed the first game in the Paladin mirror match.

From here, the series turned in Cipher's favor, who quickly defeated Kolento's Warlock three games in a row. This eliminated Kolento from the tournament and secured his Semifinal finish in the league.

Cipher: Places second at SL i-League Tournament

Name: Gareth ""Cipher"" Rouse

Team: Fade 2 Karma

Update: Cipher fell to Robin in the SL i-League StarSeries Tournament.

Analysis: The Group Stage portion of the event went poorly for Cipher, who narrowly avoided being eliminated and advanced with an unimpressive 1-2 record. In the Playoffs, he was determined to prove himself and started to do so in a drawn out, five game series against StanCifka. After starting the series with a 2-0 lead, StanCifka brought it back and tied the series bringing it to a deciding Game 5.

Cipher brought out his Secret Paladin to close it out and advance to the Semifinals. He had an impressive showing against Kolento, only falling in the Paladin mirror match and advancing to the Finals with a 3-1 series victory. Despite his success up to the Finals, Cipher failed to take care of business in the championship series, as he was only able to win one game in the best of seven. Robin proved to be too much of a challenge for him and he claimed second place at the tournament.

PurpleDrank wins DreamHack finals

Name: Ryan ""PurpleDrank"" Murphy-Root

Team: Gamers Origin

Update: PurpleDrank defeated Ersee in the finals of DreamHack Winter 2015.

Analysis: The Group Stage portion of the event went well for Purple, who only lost one round to Hoej -- the player that would tie with him at the top of the group. Both advanced from the Group Stage with records of eight wins and one loss. PurpleDrank would use this momentum in the bracket stage of the event, favoring both midrange Druid and Patron Warrior to help him advance. Both of these decks proved to be a struggle for his opponents, as Purple dominated both the Quarterfinals and Semifinals and went undefeated with his Patron Warrior deck. The Finals proved to be a similar experience for Purple, who opted to use only his Druid and Warrior decks, which had proved successful so far in the tournament. This series against Ersee ended similarly to the previous series for Purple, who closed it out 3-1. Purple made the transition from Team Archon's coach and analyst to player recently and brought his strategic knowledge in order to top the tournament. Purple has already started the path to next year's Blizzcon, and he's looking forward to making more progress during his transition from coach to player.

Legendaren advances to finals with win

Name: Anton ""Legendaren"" Danielsson

Team: London Conspiracy

Update: Legendaren defeated SuperJJ in the Semifinals of the Truesilver Championship.

Analysis: Legendaren dominated the competition in the Group Stage portion of the event, finishing first in his group to secure his spot in the Quarterfinals against Ness. With his momentum from the earlier stage of the tournament, Legendaren quickly swept the series 3-0 against Ness to advance to the Semifinals. In the semis, Legendaren would quickly dominate SuperJJ's Rogue to take Game One of the series. In the following game, SuperJJ would react with an aggressive Paladin deck to tie the series 1-1. An extremely long and grueling Game Three would give Legendaren the lead again 2-1, putting him in a position to take the series. While Game Four didn't go the Swedish player's way, Legendaren was able to recompose himself and close out the final game to win the series and advance to the Grand Finals.

Xixo wins WePlay Hearthstone League

Name: Sebastian ""Xixo"" Bentert

Team: Natus Vincere

Update: Xixo defeated MrYagut in the Finals of the Season 1 WePlay Hearthstone League.

Analysis: Xixo started the league well, placing second in the regular season standings, to advance to the Playoff portion of the event. The Semifinals proved to be similar, with Xixo only dropping one game to Ryzen as he stormed his way into the finals of the event. In the Finals, he met Mr.Yagut. Xixo started the series out strong, quickly defeating MrYagut's Druid in just seven turns. Xixo kept his momentum from the win moving into the second game of the series, and defeated Yagut's Patron Warrior before he was able to create a board full of multiplying minions. Mr.Yagut was able to respond by taking the third game as Oil Rogue, but Xixo quickly responded in Game Four shutting it down before he could create any combos, and securing his victory in the league.

Firebat advances to Grand Finals of Gamegune competition

Name: James ""Firebat"" Kostesich

Team: Team Archon

Update: Firebat defeated AKAWonder in the Semifinals of the Gamegune 2015 competition.

Analysis: Firebat dominated the competition in the Group Stage portion of the event, finishing first in his group to move on to the Playoff stage of the event. The Quarterfinals proved to be a bit of a challenge, with a drawn out series going to a fifth game before Firebat was able to advance with a 3-2 series win. Firebat brought his momentum from that win to the Semifinals, where he quickly took the first two games of the series. AKAWonder responded with determination and answered with his own pair of wins in similarly convincing fashion. The final game of the series brought Firebat's Patron Warrior up against AKAWonder's Midrange Mage deck. After a grueling early game, Firebat was able to use a massive Grim Patron, Armorsmith, and Whirlwind combo to fill his board with minions and gain an alarming amount of armor. This move would swing the tempo of the game into Firebat's favor, and AKAWonder would be unable to recover -- allowing Firebat to move to the Grand Finals.

SuperJJ wins SeatStory Cup 4

Name: Jan ""SuperJJ"" Janssen

Team: Complexity HS

Update: SuperJJ dominated the SeatStory Cup 4 with a blowout over StanCifka in the Finals.

Analysis: SuperJJ started the tournament (and the subsequent Playoff stage) with a bit of difficulty, claiming the lowest advancing spot in his group. A similar story was told in the Playoff stage, with both the Quarterfinals and Semifinals taking the full seven games for a SuperJJ victory. SuperJJ was able to win his matchups with his signature Freeze Mage in both of the series'. Moving into the Finals, SuperJJ utilized his Freeze Mage to perfection, claiming a flawless series victory and demolishing each and every deck that StanCifka tried. Despite being counterpicked in several of these games, SuperJJ won with ease and claimed the title of victor.

Ostkaka wins Hearthstone World Championship

Name: Sebastian ""Ostkaka"" Engwall

Team: Natus Vincere

Update: Ostaka beat out 15 other participants to claim his title as the Hearthstone World Champion.

Analysis: Ostaka started off the event strong, topping his group with two nearly flawless victories over both Hotform and LoveCX. He kept the momentum moving into the Quarterfinals, where he had an impressive showing against Pipingho -- dropping only to an aggressive Face Hunter deck. The Semifinals were a bit more of a challenge for Ostaka, who was taken to a fifth game against ThijsNL. After winning the first two games in the series, Ostaka lost two games with his Mage deck -- but then he came back with the same deck to close out the series and advance to the finals. Ostaka started the Grand Finals against Hotform with a convincing win using his Freeze Mage deck, and kept the momentum going to close out the series 3-0.

Xixo defeats Jab to win Arena Invitational

Name: Sebastian ""Xixo"" Bentert

Team: Natus Vincere

Update: Xixo defeated Jab at the eSports Arena Invitational to claim first place.

Analysis: Xixo started strong, advancing as the second seed of his group, along with Jab. Both players would have convincing runs through the bracket stage and they'd meet each other in the finals. In the first game, it was Xixo's midrange Druid against Jab's Face Hunter. Several key draws allowed Jab to come back from a poor start and begin the series with a 1-0 advantage. The third game favored Xixo from the start, with an expertly played Handlock to choke out Jabs' Druid for a quick second win in the series. The final game started with Xixo holding an advantage, facing Jabs' Druid for a third time with insight into what was in store for him. He responded with a standard Patron Warrior deck, one that has proven to be a favorable matchup against Druid and one of Xixo's strongest and most played decks. Xixo played expertly, as he often does, with six Grim Patrons on board by turn five -- which provec fatal to Jab. Jab was forced to surrender on turn seven, giving Xixo the win and first place in the eSports Arena Invitational.

ThijsNL bests Neira in HWC-Europe Championship

Name: Thijs ""ThijsNL"" Molendijk

Team: G2 Esports

Update: ThijsNL bested Neira in the Finals of the 2015 HWC - Europe Championship in the Road to BlizzCon.

Analysis: Things started off well for Thijs, despite landing in the same group as Ostaka (who would eventually go on to win the World Championship in November). ThijsNL advanced through the Playoff Stage with ease, sweeping Lifecoach by defeating his Control Warrior once with each of his decks. The Finals started slightly differently, with Neirea's Control Warrior proving to be too big of a challenge for Thijs' Patron Warrior. ThijsNL didn't let this phase him, though, and he responded by changing the tempo against Neirea's Druid in the second game; Thijs went on to win the rest of the series without dropping a game, claiming his title as 2015 HWC - Europe Champion.

Name: Hak-Jun ""Kranich"" Baek

Team: Team Dignitas

Update: Kranich bested Kno in the finals of the 2015 HWC - Asia Pacific Championship in the Road to Blizzcon.

Analysis: The event started off well for Kranich, despite landing in the same group as Kno -- who he'd meet again in the Finals. He advanced through the Group Stage with ease, winning both of his series' in convincing fashion. This would give him the highest seed moving into the semifinals, where he would continue his dominant run taking out Pinpingho 3-2 and securing his spot in the finals against Kno. Despite having a challenge in the semifinals, Kranich was determined to prove he was the best and quickly swept Kno in the Finals, claiming the crown of the Asia Pacific Championship.

Name: Ryan ""PurpleDrank"" Murphy-Root

Team: Gamers Origin

Update: PurpleDrank bested Hotform in the finals of the 2015 HWC - Americas Championship in the Road to BlizzCon.

Analysis: The event started off well for Purple, who won two of his three matches to secure his spot in the Playoff stage of the event. The semifinals started off well too, with Purple taking a quick win against Nias' Hunter deck to give him the 1-0 advantage in the series. Nias fought back, sticking with his Hunter deck, and he got a quick victory over Purple's Warlock. The third game in the series had a similar story, with Nias' taking a convincing victory over Purple's Warlock once again -- making the score 2-1 in the favor of Nias. PurpleDrank was able to regain his footing and swept the next two games against Nias' Warlock to advance to the finals. In the finals, Purple faced off against fellow Canadian Hotform in a nail-biting five game series. After several extremely close games, and a series score of 2-2, Purple brought out his Warlock to finish off Hotform and claim the victory in the 2015 HWC - Americas Championship.

LoveCX wins 2015 HWC - China Championship

Name: Zhongkai ""LoveCX"" Guo

Team: Yolo Miracle

Update: LoveCX bested Zoro in the Finals of the 2015 HWC - China Championship in the Road to Blizzcon.

Analysis: This event didn't have the best of starts for LoveCX, who barely advanced from his group into the Playoff Stage after playing a tiebreaker match for the final spot in the playoffs. The semifinals proved to be a similar challenge, as NoTomorrow took the first game against LoveCX. LoveXC responded with two quick wins of his own, but he was brought to a fifth and final game after NoTomorrow's Hunter deck proved to be too much. LoveCX played an expert Warlock to win the deciding game and advance to the Finals. Determined to prove that the former portion of the event had been a fluke, LoveCX had an explosive performance in the finals -- quickly sweeping the series 3-0 against Zoro, and claiming his title as the 2015 HWC - China Champion.

Kolento moves on to last match of ONOG Summer Circuit Finals

Name: Aleksander ""Kolento"" Malsh

Team: Cloud9

Update: Kolento defeated Pavel in the semifinals of the ONOG Summer Circuit Finals to advance to play Tom60229.

Analysis: Kolento quickly showed his domination in the competition during the Group Stage portion, winning both of his series' 3-0. He carried this momentum into the semifinals against Pavel, where he grabbed two straight wins to start the series with a 2-0 lead against Pavel's Hunter and Druid decks. Pavel would respond with two wins of his own to try and rally a comeback, but Kolento quickly shut him down by destroying his Hunter two games in a row to claim the series win 4-2. That victory sends Kolento into a Finals matchup against one of his opponents from the Group Stage, Tom60229.

Dog defeats Chakki in the Dreamhack Summer Semifinals

Name: David ""Dog"" Caero

Team: Team Liquid

Update: Dog defeated Chakki in the semifinals of the Dreamhack Summer 2015 competition, using his deadly combination of Warlock, Warrior, and Rogue decks.

Analysis: Dog advanced through seven different rounds of the Swiss group stages -- though he did so with difficulty, claiming one of the lowest seeds moving into the quarterfinals. This portion of the event started off grimly for Dog, but after losing to Hawkeye's Druid Dog was able to find his footing and sweep the rest of the series, moving on to the next round. This momentum proved to be beneficial, as he defeated Chakki's Warrior deck three separate times -- once with each of his three decks. This secured his position as a Grand Finalist at the event, setting the pace for a potential first place finish. The finals started off with an intense matchup against TiddlerCelestial's Druid, who would claim the first victory. The series was not over,however, as Dog would go on to win the next game and then trade wins for the rest of the series. Dog made a critical mistake in the final game by misplaying his Warrior Deck -- and that ultimately cost him a chance at the first place crown. This would secure Dog's position as the second place finisher at Dreamhack Summer 2015.",[]
espn.com,,The new holy grail of women's golf,"['Ben Fawkes', 'Gordon Simpson', 'Kevin Maguire', 'Pa Sport', 'Espn Staff', 'Stephanie Brantz', 'Jason Sobel', 'Dottie Pepper', 'Bob Harig', 'Michael Collins']","Haru Nomura of Japan hoists the trophy after winning the Women's Australian Open at The Grange GC. Morne de Klerk/Getty Images

As we farewell summer down under, we also say goodbye to the international women's golf contingent who graced our courses through February.

The Women's Australian Open in Adelaide was the most lucrative golf tournament in the country this season, with a purse of just over $Aus1.8 million; the ultimate prize at The Grange Golf Course was the Patricia Bridges Bowl but the focus of the world-class field was firmly on Olympic qualification.

As Haru Nomura accepted the trophy as just the second Japanese winner, after the inaugural champion Chako Higuchi in 1974, many others, including Australia's Karrie Webb and Minjee Lee, were mentally preparing for the next stage on the road to Rio.

The road for most Olympic contenders led to Asia, while the Ladies European Tour and Australian Ladies Professional Golf Tour players headed north to the Gold Coast for the RACV Ladies Masters. A South Korean sweep of the title (Jiyai Shin) and leading amateur trophy (16-year-old Hye-Jin Choi) when their higher-ranked compatriots were competing in Thailand, underlines the continuing rise and the depth of the women's golf scene in that part of the world.

The competition for Olympic spots will be fierce between the South Koreans, and their homeland may be the only nation with the maximum four players eligible. The qualification system includes the top 15 players automatically with a limit of four per country -- those countries without two or more in the top 15 have a maximum of two players.

In 1998, Se-ri Pak was the only Korean player on the LPGA tour; now there are seven in the top 15 of the Rolex Rankings, and 36 in the top 100. World No. 1 Lydia Ko, might well have boosted their ranks further but for the fact her parents migrated to New Zealand.

Since Pak's US Open win at Blackwolf Run in 1998, the emergence of talent from her home nation has been nothing short of phenomenal.

ABC commentator Kate Burton sums it up thus: ""Se-ri Pak tilted the axis of golf to the East with her emergence. South Korean golfers weren't just competing; they could be successful. She inspired a whole generation of golfers to take up the game, by making the impossible seem possible.""

On the effort required to achieve that success, Burton says: ""Ha Na Jang told me in Australia that she would hit between 500 and 600 balls a day when she practised. That's ridiculous. An unrivalled work ethic that's hard to replicate in the West"".

Former Australian Open winner Jane Crafter agrees.

""The work ethic and the singular mentality that golf can be a path to success and a better way of life, as well as national and family pride, are driving factors,"" Crafter says. ""It's different to the Australian approach and the holistic view that Aussie parents have for their children"".

Of Pak's influence, Crafter says: ""1988 was the Year of the Dragon which is considered lucky. The players born in that year including Inbee Park, Jiyai Shin, Na Yeon Choi are known as the 'Dragon Ladies'; they were 10 years old when they watched Se-ri Pak win and have all gone on to be incredibly successful.""

So where does that leave Australia's Olympic chances?

Minjee Lee, Australia's highest-ranked player, would know a bit about both worlds. As the daughter of South Korean migrants, she took up golf after her mother, who was a golf instructor at a Perth club, got her interested at age 10. Lee practised for several hours each day, with a focus that has reaped rewards. With her mother in support, the 19-year-old spent last year on the US tour in her first full year as a professional; she is now ranked No. 16 in the world -- surpassing her mentor and probable Olympic team-mate Webb.

While Lee sees the Olympics as an ""amazing opportunity"", it's been the motivation for Webb, Australia's 'Queen of Golf', to keep playing full-time. With more 50 professional victories around the world in a stellar career spanning more than 20 years, Webb says the Olympics will be ""the icing on a very nice cake"".

Who knows, with the ""Master and the Apprentice"" together in Rio, Australia might just have the best of both worlds.",[]

It was a day that threw everything at the 1,640 athletes racing in the 10th anniversary event of Challenge Wanaka. Ultimately it was Wanaka local, Dougal Allan (NZL), and Yvonne van Vlerken (NED) who beat Mother Nature and a strong field to take victory in 8:31:53 and 9:26:50 respectively.

Read the race recap from Challenge below:

Lake Wanaka certainly lived up to its reputation as a tough and honest course with a choppy swim, warm headwinds on the bike and rain on the run.

Mens Race

The rough conditions didnt deter defending champion, Dylan McNeice (NZL) who exited the water two minutes ahead of the rest of the field in 43:30, on a course that was slightly shortened due to the wind.

McNeice retained his lead until 98k when the might of the German Cycling Machine Maik Twelsiek (GER) proved too much. But behind them was a man on a mission to take his first victory over the 226k distance. Allan picked off first McNeice at 135km and then Twelsiek at the 14k mark on the run. From then, there was no stopping him and he continued to put time in Twelsiek, taking an emotional victory in 8:31:53. Twelsiek came in in second in 8:40:48 while Matt Russell (USA) finished off the podium in 8:42:53.

You wait for this moment all your life and when it actually happens it stuns you. Im a bit lost for words, he said, before dedicating his victory to his coach, Val Burke. The bike last year was my strength but this year I wanted to connect a good swim and a consistent run. I didnt feel the best on the bike but I got the swim and bike I hoped for. I backed myself to catch Maik and you can never write off Dylan. It was a tough race and anyone who gets to the finish today probably deserves a beer!

Womens Race

The womens race quickly came down to just two after withdrawals on the bike by defending champion Gina Crawford (NZL), Alyssa Godesky (USA) and Simone Maier (GER). Anna Cleaver (NZL) was first out of the water in 45:19 in a group which also included Crawford, Siddall and van Vlerken. After the swim that surprised even herself, van Vlerken quickly took the lead on the bike but last years runner-up Laura Sidall had other plans and over took the former world record holder at 100k, continuing the lead into the run. However, van Vlerken showed why shes known as the Flying Dutchwoman and slowly ate into Siddalls lead, overtaking her at around the 12k mark, eventually taking the victory 3:29 ahead of Siddall. Meredith Hill (AUS) finished third in 10:34.

I didnt expect to win, I think it was a mental thing rather than my physical shape as I was not as fit as I should be, said van Vlerken. I had the most amazing swim. Anna Cleaver whos an incredible swimmer was really surprised to see me next to her in the change tent! I dont know how I did it as I was scared of those waves! I was suffering on the bike because when you havent trained much, you suffer on that leg. This was my 31st long distance race so I knew Id be OK on the run and I was!

Chad Ford and Kevin Pelton extend their series on draft prospects, rookies and sophomores to break down NBA ""seniors"" -- emerging players who entered the league in 2012.

Pelton: Chad, we've had a lot of fun ranking recent rookie classes by potential -- ranking freshmen, sophomores and juniors -- so how about we wrap up this series with the ""seniors,"" fourth-year players?

espn.com,,Reaction to Team USA World Cup roster,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Scott Burnside', 'Paul Grant']","Wasn't that long ago that it would have been unthinkable that a U.S. roster for a best-on-best tournament would not include winger Phil Kessel.

But it is a reflection of American depth on the wings and of Kessel's declining stature that the Pittsburgh Penguins winger was not among the first 16 players named to Team USA Wednesday afternoon.

What makes Kessel's absence so eyebrow raising is that of the 13 skaters named Wednesday, 11 were members of the U.S. Olympic team in Sochi in 2014.

Kessel was a member of both the Sochi Olympic team and the 2010 Olympic team that lost to Canada in the gold-medal game in Vancouver.

But in spite of being traded by the lowly Toronto Maple Leafs to the Penguins last summer, Kessel has failed to find a consistent scoring groove. While many believed he was primed for a run at the Rocket Richard Trophy playing with either Sidney Crosby or Evgeni Malkin (both named to their respective World Cup of Hockey rosters on Wednesday, by the way) Kessel finds himself tied for 51st in the NHL in goals with 19 and the Penguins are in a dogfight to hold onto a postseason berth.

One has to imagine that a strong finish to the end of the regular season and a good playoff showing for the Penguins, if the Pens end up qualifying for the postseason, will see Kessel among the final four forwards named on June 1. But it's far from a lock. The problem facing Kessel, a right-handed shot, is that the U.S. has a plethora of quality wingers hoping for a spot on this team and many of them are also right-handed shots, such as Kyle Okposo of the New York Islanders and Bobby Ryan of the Ottawa Senators who were not among the first 16, either. Among the forwards already named Blake Wheeler, T.J. Oshie and the league's leading scorer Patrick Kane are right-hand shots.

Add in the fact that Kessel can primarily play only in the top six given that he is not a particularly strong two-way player or penalty killer, and it is not beyond the pale that Kessel cannot find a place on this roster come June 1. Of course, if he is left off the final roster and the Americans struggle offensively in Toronto, there will be no shortage of second-guessing. But there's no way to quibble with Kessel's absence from the top 16 at this point in the season.

Random thoughts on the American 16:

Must admit that at no point did I ever have Justin Abdelkader on any of our shadow rosters but he is a left-handed shot and brings size and has experience for the Detroit Red Wings playing with skilled players Pavel Datsyuk and Henrik Zetterberg. He is a versatile player and can play up and down the lineup. Still, was a bit of a surprise that Abdelkader got the nod over Ryan or two-time Olympian David Backes or even Nick Foligno, who is a left-handed playing for head coach John Tortorella for the Columbus Blue Jackets and who a year ago was the top-scoring American player.

Speaking of Ryan, the Senators winger represented one of the most emotional of decisions for the U.S. management team when he was left off the Sochi roster. He has had a solid season for Ottawa with 21 goals but has just two in his last 11 games and there is a streaky element to Ryan's game that the management team obviously felt needed further observation. Like Kessel, a strong finish and a possible playoff berth for Ottawa would put Ryan in good stead to join the World Cup roster.

Finally, the other surprise -- slight but a surprise, nonetheless -- for us was the naming of Dustin Byfuglien of the Winnipeg Jets to the first 16. Byfuglien was named ahead of Kevin Shattenkirk of the St. Louis Blues and Cam Fowler of the Anaheim Ducks -- both important parts of the blue line corps in Sochi -- but it's a testament to Byfuglien's unique skill set and the fact the World Cup games are going to be played in the smaller NHL rink at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto that paved the way for Byfuglien's place on the initial roster offering.

Asked specifically about Kessel and Abdelkader, GM Dean Lombardi said ""we only have so many slots."" ""It's not just Phil Kessel,"" Lombardi said, noting that Justin Faulk, a member of the 2014 Olympic team, and Ryan weren't named Wednesday.

As for Abdelkader, Lombardi said that the Detroit winger just keeps getting better.

""He's very difficult to play against,"" Lomabardi said. ""And he's only going to get better.""

Assistant GM Paul Holmgren said the management team believed Byfuglien deserved to be in the first 16.

""He's clearly a better player leading up to the World Cup than he was going into the picking of the Olympic team back in 2014,"" Holmgren said. ""He's trimmed down. He's made more of a commitment. He's become a better pro.

""This is, for me, a real positive addition to our team,"" added Holmgren, who also noted that Byfuglien can play both defense and forward.",[]
espn.com,,Damon Harrison reaches agreement with New York Giants on contract,"['Vaughn Mcclure', 'Tory Barron', 'David Newton', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Eric Williams', 'Josh Weinfuss', 'Jim Trotter', 'Kevin Seifert', 'Ben Goessling', 'Mike Reiss']","The NFL Insiders crew react to former Dolphins DE Olivier Vernon reaching a deal with the Giants, and how this affects both teams moving forward. (1:29)

The New York Giants made a pair of defensive line additions Wednesday, agreeing to contracts with Damon Harrison, a source told ESPN's Dan Graziano, and Olivier Vernon, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Vernon's contract is worth $85 million over five years with $52.5 million guaranteed, sources told ESPN, confirming multiple media reports.

The 25-year-old Vernon received the Dolphins' transition tag March 1. The one-year transition tag for a defensive end is worth $12.734 million, according to the NFL Players Association. With the tag, other teams could negotiate with Vernon, but the Dolphins had the right to match any offers.

Vernon led the Dolphins last season with 7.5 sacks in addition to 61 tackles. He picked up his play in the second half of the season when Pro Bowl defensive end Cameron Wake was lost for the year with an Achilles injury.

Olivier Vernon, who has reportedly agreed to sign with the Giants, had 29 sacks in four seasons with the Dolphins. Joe Robbins/Getty Images

Vernon started all 16 games for Miami for the second straight year and hasn't missed a game in four seasons. He plays primarily on the right side of the defense, which is the tougher position for defensive ends because they face opposing left tackles.

""I think my film work is going to speak for itself,"" Vernon told ESPN in December concerning free agency. ""So it's on the coaches in what they see on film.""

Vernon, a Miami native, played football in South Florida at every level. He played for American High School and at the University of Miami in college. The Dolphins drafted Vernon in the third round in 2012.

Last season Miami used the transition tag on tight end Charles Clay, who wound up signing a better offer with the Buffalo Bills.

Editor's Picks Damon Harrison a costly but important signing for Giants If you're going to overspend to get a run-stuffing defensive tackle -- as the Giants did -- it had better be the best run-stuffing defensive tackle in the league. Which is what Damon Harrison is.

Money for 'Big Snacks' Harrison just too big for Jets to afford The Jets had to make a choice for the franchise tag -- Muhammad Wilkerson or Damon Harrison -- knowing there was a good chance they would lose the untagged player. And they did, as Harrison agreed to a huge contract with the Giants.

Harrison, 27, has been with the New York Jets for the past four seasons. He played last season on a one-year, $2.4 million contract, the amount of his upgraded tender as a restricted free agent.

Affectionately known as ""Big Snacks,"" Harrison arrived in 2012 as an undrafted free agent from tiny William Penn (Iowa) University and developed into one of the league's premier run-stuffing tackles. Before the season, he called himself ""the best nose tackle in football.""

He emerged as a regular in his second season and has started 48 consecutive games. He is one of the reasons the Jets finished third, fifth and second in run defense over the past three seasons, respectively.

Playing only first and second down, Harrison has just 1.5 career sacks, but he has excelled against the run. He registered a career-high 39 solo tackles last season, demonstrating the quickness to play in coach Todd Bowles' one-gap system.

Elsewhere on defense, the Giants agreed to a five-year, $62.5 million contract with cornerback Janoris Jenkins, sources told ESPN. They also announced that defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul had re-signed with New York on a one-year contract.

espn.com,,Dallas Mavericks' front office failures on full display in rout by Los,"['Tim Macmahon', 'Marc Stein', 'One Naci N']","Chris Paul has 27 points and seven assists and DeAndre Jordan adds 23 points and 20 rebounds as the Clippers defeat the Mavericks 109-90. (0:49)

DALLAS -- The decision-makers for the Dallas Mavericks dreamed of DeAndre Jordan putting on this kind of display of physical dominance in the American Airlines Center.

Just not while wearing a Los Angeles Clippers uniform.

Now you know why we wanted him, Dallas coach Rick Carlisle deadpanned after Jordans 23-point, 20-rebound outing played a major part in the Clippers 109-90 rout of the Mavs, a third straight loss for a Dallas squad scrapping for one of the Western Conferences last playoff spots.

Carlisle could have said the same thing Monday night about Clippers point guard Chris Paul, one of Dallas prime targets for the Mavs when owner Mark Cuban made the controversial decision after the 2011 lockout to prioritize creating salary-cap space over keeping an aging title team together. Paul lit up the Mavs for 27 points and seven assists in 28 minutes, outscoring Dallas by himself during the third quarter, when the Clippers turned a two-point halftime deficit into a comfortable lead.

This blowout basically symbolized four long, mostly fruitless years of frustration for the Mavs front office.

The Clippers two healthy max-salaried players, both once objects of Cubans recruiting obsession, performed to the standard of their salaries. Cuban can claim the Clippers will always be the Clippers, as he did back in October before these teams met, but they at least have a prayer of contending with Paul and Jordan, a perennial All-Star point guard who never even granted the Mavs a meeting in free agency a few years ago and an elite big man who broke the Mavs heart last summer by reneging on his commitment to come to Dallas.

Dallas two max players, their consolation prizes from four offseasons of failing to hook a big fish, delivered duds against the Clippers. Wings Chandler Parsons and Wesley Matthews combined to score 11 points on 3-of-18 shooting.

This was the second straight offensive stinker for Parsons, but those have been the exception for him since returning to form after a tough recovery from hybrid microfracture surgery on his right knee. He has had the best statistical stretch of his career, averaging an extremely efficient 18.0 points per game over the past two months, playing well enough that hes expected to get a significant raise with another max contract this summer when he opts out of the last year of his deal to enter a wild market with the cap soaring.

This was as tough a night as Matthews has had in his career, as he was outscored 22-2 by Clippers shooting guard J.J. Redick and missed all six of his shots from the floor. However, struggles are unfortunately the norm for Matthews, who ranks 117th of 118 qualifiers in field goal percentage (38.4 percent), leading only the retiring, broken-down Kobe Bryant.

It cant be considered stunning that a player who ruptured an Achilles tendon last March is struggling, and the extraordinary will and toughness Matthews has shown while leading the Mavs in minutes is to be commended. But a high standard comes along with such hefty paychecks and Matthews isnt coming close to meeting it in the first season of his four-year, $70 million deal.

That standard applies even in the odd case of Matthews, whom the Mavs were willing to pay significantly more than they originally planned because they knew Jordan was a big fan of his. The Mavs believed getting Matthews on board would be critical to closing the deal with Jordan, and they were right, if only temporarily. Cuban used the unusual tactic of telling Matthews that hed pay as much as possible depending on Jordans decision, a promise that ultimately cost the Mavs an extra $13 million over the course of the contract.

The uncomfortable truth is that the Mavs front office, for all of its big plans and creative pitches over the past four years, has consistently put together a mediocre product during Dirk Nowitzkis golden years.

Dallas has won a grand total of four playoff games in four years since that amazing 2011 title run, making the Mavs the rare one-All-Star championship squad. Its hard to envision the Mavs adding much, if any, to that total this season.

Weve got to get there first, Nowitzki said, well aware that the Mavs next eight opponents have winning records and that Dallas has only a three-game cushion over the ninth-place Utah Jazz. I think thats what we need to worry about first. Weve got a brutal stretch coming up. Weve laid some eggs against some teams we needed to beat, and now the schedule is picking up tremendously. Now at this point, weve got to worry about making the playoffs.

The Mavs are 2-10 against the Wests top four teams this season, the victories coming Nov. 11 over the Clippers and Dec. 30 against a Golden State squad that was missing MVP Stephen Curry. Dallas has lost seven straight to its potential playoff draws since then with an average margin of defeat of 18.4 points.

Its certainly fair to ask whether the Mavs, whose 9-20 record against plus-.500 foes is the worst of any team currently in playoff position, lack the talent to compete against high-caliber opponents. It just isnt a popular question in some parts of the locker room.

I think were just going through a tough stretch right now, said Parsons, the chief recruiter who was especially crushed by Jordans decision reversal. Weve got a lot of talent in this room and a lot of experience. Were just having a lot of mental lapses and not really showing it. Tonight it got ugly.

The take of Matthews, who was particularly displeased to discuss whether Dallas has a talent problem: I mean, you guys can pick apart our team all you want. Weve got talent on this team. So yall can miss me with that.

Unfortunately, the Mavs are stuck on the mediocrity treadmill because of the front offices many misses, two of which dominated in Dallas on Monday night.",[]
espn.com,,Terry Flanagan vs. Derry Mathews will be more exciting than Carl Frampton vs. Scott Quigg,"['Dan Rafael', 'Pa Sport', 'Nick Parkinson', 'Brian Campbell', 'Nigel Collins']","Terry Flanagan and Derry Mathews are promising that Saturday's fight will be more exciting than Carl Frampton-Scott Quigg.

Frampton's points win over Quigg for the WBA and IBF world super-bantamweight titles two weekends ago failed to live up to expectation and the hype.

But Mathews (38-9-2, 20 KOs) insists he will not play a cagey game when he tries to dethrone WBO lightweight king Flanagan (29-0, 12 KOs), who will be making a second defence at Liverpool's Echo Arena.

""The Frampton-Quigg fight would have put a glass eye to sleep and it was a terrible fight,"" said Mathews.

""But we will give everyone value for money, whether they are there in the arena or watching on TV. It will be a proper dust-up, with no dancing around avoiding each other.""

Mathews will be challenging for a world title for the first time after once again reviving a career that seemed to be fizzling out, and believes he will inspired by his home crowd.

The 32-year-old has had mixed fortunes in the ring, with a highlight coming in 2012 when he stopped current WBA world champion Anthony Crolla in six rounds. However, since then, he's lost two European title fights and suffered a third defeat against Flanagan himself back in the 2012 Prizefighter Tournament.

""I'm not going to get another chance and I'm grateful for the opportunity at the title,"" Mathews added.

""I've got to do whatever I can to get the title, whether it's to go to war or box steady. I know I'm going to win. Our styles are going to clash nicely.

""I'm at the peak of my career now and knocking on the door. I've had to be a different fighter over the last two or three years and I've improved 50 percent.

""I won ABA titles as an amateur so you don't lose something, it's about getting it back out of me and I'm boxing more now than I perhaps did a few years ago.

""But I have also matured more, I look after my body better; I'm a personal trainer and I don't go out boozing.

""If he wants to scrap, I will scrap. If he wants to box, I will box. Terry always starts fast so I have to make sure I adapt. It's my 50th professional fight and it's a massive bonus that it is in my home city.""

Flanagan, 26, from Manchester, has won his last two fights in the second round against Americans Jose Zepeda [who dislocated a shoulder] and Diego Magdaleno, extending his unbeaten career record to 29 straight wins.

""I don't think it will be boring, because I'm never in a boring fight,"" said Flanagan. ""He's going to give it his all and I'll have to be at my best.

""Because I'm not the best talker and I don't call people out there is less noise and hype around me.""",[]
espn.com,,Milwaukee Bucks F Giannis Antetokounmpo has the NBA's most exceptional body,"['Tim Macmahon', 'Anthony Olivieri', 'Dave Mcmenamin', 'Michael C', 'Royce Young', 'Kevin Arnovitz', 'Zach Lowe', 'Baxter Holmes', 'Ian Begley', 'Justin Verrier']","This story appears in ESPN The Magazine's Feb. 29 Analytics Issue. Subscribe today!

Early in the 2012-13 season, 18-year-old Giannis Antetokounmpo landed on the radar of NBA scouts, shrouded in mystery. He didn't attend the combine or team workouts, so he had never been extensively measured. He had played mostly in Greece's youth system and second-tier pro league, so no one could agree on how he'd best be used in the NBA. There was only one consensus: His body was among the best scouts had ever seen.

The Bucks drafted Antetokounmpo 15th overall that year, feeling he combined big-man length with the agility of an elite guard. Their instincts were quickly proved right: Thanks to his unique biomechanical and physiological qualities, he is one of just three players in the past decade to average 15 points, 7 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 1 block per game in his age-21 season.

To understand how Antetokounmpo's form gives way to function, we recently spent a day measuring the 6-foot-11 forward, then asked Marcus Elliott, M.D., the founder of P3 Applied Sports Science, a training center that specializes in advanced athlete assessment, to help break him down. Welcome to our tour of the NBA's ideal body.

Dustin Snipes

WINGSPAN: Basketball is a game of angles; a defender isn't so much guarding his man as he is reducing the size of his angle to drive to the basket or pass to teammates. That's where wingspan factors in for Antetokounmpo, whose outstretched arms measure 7-foot-3, 4 inches more than his height. ""If you have long arms, it allows you to get places faster, without having to move your feet or your center of mass,"" Elliott says. Antetokounmpo ranks in the top 10 in rebound rate among small forwards. The leader? Quincy Acy, whose wingspan is 9 inches longer than his height.

Dustin Snipes

LATERAL MOVEMENT: ""To be a great lateral mover in the NBA, you've got to have great hips,"" Elliott says. ""That means high force, very stable and flexible."" That can be challenging for an NBA big man, who can rarely get his hips low enough to create the lateral force to move like a wing player. But Antetokounmpo isn't a typical big man. He displays great hip extension and high abduction and adduction velocities, which means he's able to handle lateral motion (say, sliding side to side while defending a ball handler) faster than other athletes his size.

HEIGHT: ""When we first drafted Giannis, we measured him at 6-foot-812,"" Bucks GM John Hammond says. But at midseason, the Bucks' strength and conditioning coach walked into Hammond's office. ""He told me, 'The kid is still growing and I don't think he's done.'"" By season's end, he was 6-11. Even more remarkable is that the basketball gods gifted Antetokounmpo those extra 212 inches of height without exacting any payment. The 6-11 Giannis is every bit as stable and agile as the shorter version. If he remains at the small forward position, he'll do so as the tallest wing in the league.

Dustin Snipes

LEAN MUSCLE: Over the past 18 months, Antetokounmpo has put on an impressive amount of muscle-his weight went from 196 pounds on draft day to 222 this season. But, crucially, he's managed to do it without bulking up. ""To be big is one thing, but to have muscles that are tuned to their optimal characteristics is another,"" says Troy Flanagan, Ph.D., the Bucks' director of performance. All that lean muscle mass allows him to generate force quickly, which gives him the agility and explosiveness that the NBA game demands.

CORE: Typically, in players of Antetokounmpo's length and power, sports scientists see core instability, but this is yet another area in which the big Greek resembles more compact players. Other long players will have stability in the sagittal plane (which divides the trunk down the middle) but not in their frontal or horizontal planes. Antetokounmpo checks all boxes. The result? The aerobatic ability to dribble the length of the floor, elevate for a rebound, fly laterally through the air for an alley-oop-all complex movements that originate from the core.

Dustin Snipes

HANDS: The length of the average adult male hand, measured from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the pinkie, is 7.4 inches. For Antetokounmpo, it's 12 inches. (For reference, Kawhi Leonard's hand is 11.25 inches, and LeBron James' is 9.25.) The breadth of Antetokounmpo's hands enables him to get a strong ""pinch grip"" on a 29.5-inch basketball (what's commonly known as palming). Not only does palming the ball allow Antetokounmpo to gain maximum control, but by virtue of making the ball an extension of his arm, he effectively gains 2 more inches in height.

Dustin Snipes

LAUNCH POWER: Sports scientists obsess about an athlete's ability to transfer energy from his landing into his next liftoff. A typical athlete needs time to regather and unwind before his body can generate the energy to get off the ground again. ""Giannis doesn't have that,"" Elliott says. ""His system can handle those giant forces. He's coming down at high velocity, and he doesn't resist it ... he's able to [turn it into] an advantage."" One of the hallmarks of athleticism, transferring energy is what allows Antetokounmpo to bounce around the floor like he's on a pogo stick.

ACHILLES: The Bucks measured Antetokounmpo's Achilles tendon from the back of the heel to the belly of the calf, and, at 13.5 inches (almost double the length of the average adult male's), well: ""I have never seen an Achilles like his,"" Flanagan says. Many sports scientists believe a long Achilles means more efficient storage and release of elastic energy. That translates to acceleration and explosive movement-exactly the sort of traits that enable Antetokounmpo to, oh, say, burst almost the entire length of the floor in two dribbles. (Seriously. Google it.) So much for Antetokounmpo's having an Achilles' heel.",[]
espn.com,,Defending champion Marcel Hirscher secures 3rd World Cup giant slalom title,"['Johnette Howard', 'Espn Staff', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Adriana Terrazas', 'Bonnie D']","KRANJSKA GORA, Slovenia -- Having retained his World Cup giant slalom title with a race to spare, Marcel Hirscher can start preparing for an even bigger celebration.

By winning Saturday's GS, the Austrian extended his lead in the overall standings to 333 points, leaving him with only a mathematical chance of missing out on his fifth straight overall title.

Hirscher's sole rival, Norwegian slalom specialist Henrik Kristoffersen, has just three technical races left, and he could only make up the deficit if he starts racing in speed events -- something he hasn't done before at a World Cup level.

""I still can't believe it,"" Hirscher said. ""Everyone is talking about it, but I only believe it after I've checked all calculations.""

Hirscher would match the best mark set by Austrian-born Marc Girardelli. Competing for Luxembourg, Girardelli won his fifth and most recent overall title in 1993.

Hirscher, however, would be the only male skier to have won five titles in a row, a feat achieved once on the women's World Cup by fellow Austrian Annemarie Moser-Proell in the 1970s.

Hirscher won Saturday's next-to-last giant slalom to build an insurmountable 111-point lead in the discipline standings. The last GS is at the World Cup finals in two weeks.

It's the third GS globe for Hirscher, who won last year and also in 2012.

In addition to his four overall and three slaloms titles, Hirscher has won 10 crystal globes. It puts him level with Phil Mahre of the United States in sixth on the all-time list, led by Swedish great Ingemar Stenmark with 16 titles.

The Austrian held on to his first-run lead to finish 0.53 seconds ahead of France's Alexis Pinturault, who had won the past four giant slaloms. Kristoffersen was 1.59 back in third.

""I am really happy about it,"" Hirscher said. ""It wasn't easy in the last couple of giant slaloms. But today was really cool.""

Pinturault beat Hirscher in a shortened GS due to overnight snowfall Friday, but conditions were different for Saturday's race. Freezing temperatures had turned the Podkoren into a very rough and bumpy course.

Low clouds made for flat light, and visibility was further hampered in the second run by fog and snowfall.

Hirscher carried a 0.41-second lead over Pinturault into the final run, but he had lost that advantage at the first split time.

However, Hirscher accelerated and skied the steep bottom part flawlessly to regain more than a half-second on the Frenchman.

""I knew Alexis and Henrik had done their job pretty good,"" Hirscher said. ""So I knew I had to do my best.""

Hirscher has also a slim chance to win the slalom title, as he trails Kristoffersen by 131 points with two races remaining. The Norwegian will secure that title in Sunday's slalom if he doesn't lose more than 30 points on the Austrian.

""Henrik can only beat himself. You have to be realistic,"" said Hirscher, who won the slalom title the past three seasons.",[]

Cam Talbot, Edmonton Oilers

Talbot made 39 saves, including 24 over the final two periods, as the Oilers got a 2-1 road win over the Winnipeg Jets. Talbot has now won four straight starts, with a .979 save percentage in that span.

Petr Mrazek, Detroit Red Wings

Mrazek allowed two goals on five shots before being pulled just 6 minutes, 19 seconds into the Red Wings' 4-1 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks after allowing five goals in a loss to the Blackhawks in his previous start.

Are the Blues a true threat to win the Central Division?

@Real_ESPNLeBrun: The St. Louis Blues beat the Minnesota Wild by a 4-2 count on Sunday to remain right there in the race for the Central Division title. Isn't it funny, though, that most people don't really include St. Louis when discussing a Central race that also includes the Chicago Blackhawks and Dallas Stars? Whether it's a perception created from their playoff stumbles over the past half-decade or something else, the fact is that the Blues have 85 points (two behind the Stars and Hawks) but haven't gotten much attention league-wide. The Blues have won seven of their past 10 games to make up ground on the Stars (3-5-2 in their past 10) and the Hawks (5-4-1 in their past 10). Wouldn't it be funny if this is finally the year the Blues have a playoff run, when so few people are talking about them? A lot is riding on it, that's for sure. I think tangible change is coming for the Blues if they don't win a round or two.

@ESPN_Burnside: I'm starting to feel the love for the Blues with the playoffs now just a month or so away, Pierre. They have battled through injuries to key personnel up and down their lineup all season long and just keep on trucking. If they aren't the definition of battle-tested, I don't know what is. As we've discussed, winning the division is key in order to avoid the annual postseason death match between the second- and third-place Central Division teams, and the Blues have positioned themselves nicely even without the high profile of the defending Stanley Cup champions and the high-flying Stars. In Sunday's game, Blues goalie Jake Allen was tremendous while the Wild's Devan Dubnyk was not so tremendous, even though the Wild fought back valiantly. It will be hard to dislodge Chicago at the top of the Central, but it's going to be a great finish in hockey's toughest division -- even if it's Chicago in first that would create a must-see first-round series between St. Louis and Dallas. Stay tuned.

@CraigCustance: The Blues resilience this season while they've been crushed by injuries has quietly been one of the most impressive performances of the year. No team has lost players of such high value for longer periods than the Blues. And yet, here we are, headed down the stretch with them pushing the contenders at the top of the Central. There are a few really good teams around the league that could look noticeably different next season if things don't go well in the playoffs, starting with the Blues, Tampa Bay Lightning and New York Islanders. Of those teams, I think the Blues face the most pressure to perform this spring. I've defended their early exits in the past, in part because of the quality of competition they've faced every year, but after a while there are no longer any excuses. If this Blues team is as good as we think, it's time for a breakthrough.

@ESPNJoeyMac: If the Blues are one-and-done again this postseason, you would have to think Ken Hitchcock's coaching days in St. Louis are over. The Wild dismissed the Blues in the first round last spring, but St. Louis has responded well this season. The Blues are in the midst of a three-game winning streak, but with the top three teams in the Central each having 14 games remaining the Blues are going to need more clutch performances like the one Allen gave them Sunday. Hitchcock made it a point last season to not place blame on Allen for the team's first-round exit, and he believed that experience would serve Allen well moving forward. We'll see if that's the case next month, when the playoffs begin.

(3:39)

Here's a #protip for those attempting to forecast which current college players will become FBS head coaches: Don't look in the obvious places.

If the current FBS coaches are any indication, start brushing up on Drake's roster or Central Arkansas' or Mount Union's. If you think Millikin and Muskingum are bacterial infections, you're wrong. Those two Division III schools have combined to produce three current FBS coaches -- that's three more than Texas or Ohio State. Once you've digested the Division III landscape, check out the NAIA, Division II and FCS. Plenty of top-tier college coaches played in the sport's lower rungs.

Don't write off the Power 5. but if you're looking for future coaches, find walk-ons who quickly earn scholarships, eventually become team captains and excel academically. There are 41 current FBS coaches who played quarterback in college, by far the most of any position. Other feeder positions include linebacker and safety. There are only five FBS coaches who played line in college.

NFL potential isn't a prerequisite for future coaches. It's just the opposite. Only one current coach had a substantial NFL career; that dude wears khakis now. Most coaches weren't elite players. Steve Spurrier's resignation at South Carolina removed the lone Heisman Trophy winner from the coaching rankings.

Now to why we're here: to rank every college coach as a football player. The rankings considered a coach's entire playing career: high school, college and (where applicable) pro. By far the biggest challenge was accounting for the level of college competition. What's better: a player who starred in Division II or Division III or one who reached the sport's biggest stage but remained largely outside the spotlight?

These rankings accentuated FBS/Power 5 competition as well as pro experience while also recognizing coaches who were truly elite at lower levels. Non-FBS players who earned national honors, especially in multiple years, were rewarded, and so were those who lettered all four years. Those who played at lower levels without notable accolades backslid.

Illinois' quick coaching change allowed all 129 coaches to be included (UAB's Bill Clark, while not competing currently, is ranked).

Let's get started.

espn.com,,Linebacker Danny Trevathan to sign with Chicago Bears,"['Vaughn Mcclure', 'Tory Barron', 'David Newton', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Eric Williams', 'Josh Weinfuss', 'Jim Trotter', 'Kevin Seifert', 'Ben Goessling', 'Mike Reiss']","The NFL Insiders crew talks about how LB Danny Trevathan's familiarity with Bears coach John Fox led him to sign with Chicago, as well as how he immediately improves their defense. (1:14)

CHICAGO -- The Chicago Bears made their first big move in free agency, agreeing to a contract with Denver Broncos inside linebacker Danny Trevathan.

The Bears announced Trevathan, who provides a much-needed upgrade to anchor the middle of the defense, agreed to a four-year contract.

Entering his fifth NFL season, Trevathan played three years in Denver under Bears coach John Fox and has a built-in comfort level with Chicago's 3-4 defensive scheme.

Editor's Picks Dickerson: Trevathan helps Bears' D improve The Bears struggled at inside linebacker in their new 3-4 scheme, and signing Danny Trevathan gives them a young, yet experienced and successful piece they can build around, Jeff Dickerson writes.

Danny Trevathan is answer to Bears' problems at linebacker The Bears, focused on revamping their defense, will get an immediate boost from Danny Trevathan at inside linebacker, writes Sam Monson. 1 Related

The Bears struggled to establish consistency at inside linebacker last year, relying on a rotating cast of characters that included former first-round pick Shea McClellin and Christian Jones.

General manager Ryan Pace said at the NFL scouting combine the club does have a certain degree of interest in re-singing McClellin, who is also an unrestricted free agent after the team declined his fifth-year option.

The 2015 season marked a bounce-back for Trevathan after he spent much of the 2014 season out of the lineup with three separate injuries to his left leg. After the third injury, Trevathan went to injured reserve.

He led the team in tackles in two of the past three seasons, topping 100 tackles in those two years.

But he started all but one game in the regular season in 2015 and all three of the team's postseason games.

Trevathan is a three-down linebacker who has played both in the 3-4 scheme the Broncos played this past season as well as the 4-3 scheme Fox and then-defensive coordinator Jack Del Rio used in his first three seasons with the team.

As Trevathan has put it: ""I feel like I can play anywhere anybody needs me to play.""

Trevathan, who turns 26 on March 24, was the Broncos' sixth-round pick in 2012.

Cornerback Tracy Porter, who signed a one-year contract with the Bears last summer, will stay in Chicago after coming to a three-year agreement with the team, a source said. Porter's deal is worth $16.5 million, according to ESPN and media reports.

Porter, 29, recovered from an injury-plagued one-year stint in Washington (three games played in 2014) to become arguably Chicago's most effective cornerback last season. He led the team with 22 pass breakups.

Porter's crowning achievement happened in Chicago's upset victory at Green Bay when he became the only player to record four pass breakups against Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers in a single game.

Chicago continued its free-agent influx by plucking right tackle Bobby Massie from the Arizona Cardinals on a three-year deal.

Massie, 26, started 14 games for the Cardinals last season after being suspended for the first two for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy, which stemmed from a DUI arrest in January 2015.

With 2015 first-round pick D.J. Humphries waiting in the wings for the Cardinals, the 26-year-old Massie was credited with giving up 39 quarterback hurries, seven sacks and six hits last season.

Those tweets were part of a larger, rambling rant by the Tennis Hall of Famer on Monday.

At her induction into the Tennis Hall of Fame in 2012, Capriati said she felt she had to leave the game earlier than she wanted because of injuries.

""It was tough having to leave the game,"" she said, with her voice cracking a bit with emotion. ""It's like mourning a loved one that's gone and a relationship's that gone, a part of yourself. It wasn't easy, but something that's gone and what you loved to do.

""It took a while to accept that and let go. This is so great for me because it's putting a lot of closure to my career, and I'm able to move forward, give thanks, take thanks, give the honor and take the honor, and just be acknowledged here. It means everything to me.""

Capriati retired in 2004 with a 430-176 record in her career, which started when she was 14. She reached the semifinals at her first Grand Slam event, the 1990 French Open. She won a gold medal for the United States at Barcelona in 1992.

She temporarily dropped off the tour following the 1993 U.S. Open, when drugs and other problems sidetracked her life and career. She was arrested in 1993 for shoplifting at a Florida mall and again in 1994 for marijuana possession. She spent time in drug rehabilitation in 1994.

She returned to the sport in 1996 and won the first of her three Grand Slams with the 2001 Australian Open. She also won the French Open that year, and she was the only player to reach at least the semifinals in all four Grand Slams that year, which culminated with her selection as The Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year. She won the 2002 Australian Open by rallying past Martina Hingis in the final after trailing 4-6, 0-4.

Now that the NFL combine is behind us, let's take a look at the players who have moved up and down our Top 32, while drawing on the same scouting reports and making changes only where necessary. We're also incorporating charts for each player, which feature the two most important measurables for that player's position (when available). Each chart includes outstanding, average and red-flag benchmarks based on historical data.

Editor's Picks McShay: 2016 NFL Mock Draft 3.0 Which player will your team select in Round 1? Todd McShay projects the picks in the 2016 NFL draft, with CB Jalen Ramsey and OT Laremy Tunsil cracking the top five.

We'll continue to update our board as we get closer to the 2016 NFL draft. Although it's a given that some players will move into the rankings while others drop out, this provides a good snapshot of which players currently have the most NFL potential, based on our evaluations. For our full rankings list, check out this link.

(Underclassmen are noted with an asterisk.)

1. Joey Bosa, DE, Ohio State*

The gap between Bosa and the other top-tier players in this draft is narrowing, but the Ohio State star remains No. 1 on my board. While Bosa does not have elite speed off the edge, as evidenced by his combine 40 time (see chart below), he shows the relentlessness and instincts shared by most top-level NFL pass-rushers. Bosa keeps offensive linemen off-balance with a wide array of pass-rush moves. Playing with outstanding effort, he finished his Buckeyes career with 50.5 tackles for loss in 41 games.

2. Laremy Tunsil, OT, Mississippi*

An exceptional athlete, Tunsil is firmly in the mix for the No. 1 overall pick because of his ability to redirect and mirror top pass-rushers. He's not a road grader in the run game, but he shows great range in that area and would fit best in a zone-blocking scheme due to his exceptional mobility. Tunsil opted against running the 40-yard dash and doing the bench press at the combine, but I'm looking forward to seeing if the results match the tape when he works out at Ole Miss' pro day later this month.

3. DeForest Buckner, DE, Oregon

Buckner isn't going to win many battles with speed, but he has good length and explosive upper-body power to push the pocket as a pass-rusher. Buckner, who's best suited to play 5-technique in a 3-4, also has the quickness and agility to play left defensive end in a 4-3. He posted 17.0 TFLs (including 10.5 sacks) in 2015, showing the versatility and motor befitting a top-five pick.",[]

espn.com,,"Different roads lead Morgan Brian, Lindsey Horan to starring roles in USWNT midfield",[],"Different roads lead Morgan Brian, Lindsey Horan to starring roles in U.S. midfield

Julie Foudy explains why the United States women's team passed on playing in the Algarve Cup in Portugal this year to instead host the SheBelieves Cup against England, France and Germany.

For proof that a system responsible for supplying the United States with the talent to set the standard in women's soccer remains robust, look no further than Morgan Brian. Twice the national college player of the year at the University of Virginia and then a world champion for her country, she turned 23 only after she earned the Golden Ball as the best player in last month's CONCACAF Olympic qualifying tournament.

Look no further than the player next to her for proof that the system no longer holds a monopoly.

The United States women's national team hopes the midfield partnership between Brian and 21-year-old Lindsey Horan answers one of the questions that stands in the way of Olympic gold this summer. Two of the brightest talents the country has produced in recent years, the pair traveled very different roads to get to this moment. Brian was the All-American. Horan, who bypassed college to sign a professional contract in Europe out of high school, was the American abroad.

""It's cool because it's just two different paths that led to the same thing,"" Horan said.

For all the attention understandably paid to Abby Wambach during her farewell, the most pressing tactical problem the national team faced as it shifted gears from the World Cup to the Olympics was not how to replace international soccer's all-time leading scorer, but instead how to best replace Lauren Holiday. A surprise retiree, Holiday's role deep in the midfield was an important part of the United States' World Cup victory. The stability supplied by Holiday and Brian, who claimed a starting role alongside Holiday last summer, allowed Carli Lloyd the freedom to do what she did in the attacking No. 10 role.

Now the United States counts on Horan and Brian for that stability. The 23-year-old with one World Cup is suddenly the senior partner alongside a player with 11 total appearances for the national team. For Lloyd to keep tormenting the world, for Alex Morgan to find goals, and for Crystal Dunn, Mallory Pugh and others to emerge as game-changers, the central midfield must be American territory.

""The two center mids on this team, I think, are in charge of setting the tempo,"" Brian said. ""The ability we have to get the ball a lot and influence the game a lot -- I think if we're touching the ball a lot, and we're going through the midfield, [the team] is playing well. It's kind of like the engine of the team. We're the center of the park, so everything goes through us.""

Brian's strong play of late, albeit against lesser regional opposition, is its own positive review of her new partner. Brian is comfortable playing a more aggressive role in part because she trusts the player alongside her. Brian and Horan played together on various youth national teams and share a perspective on the game quickly explained by their affinity for the stylish, nuanced soccer of FC Barcelona.

""I think I really know how Morgan plays and how her soccer mind works,"" Horan said. ""I think it's very similar to how mine is, so I think that's really big for us playing in the mid together. I know what she's going to do. I know where she's going to be and what she's thinking about.""

Matthew Visinsky/Icon Sportswire Morgan Brian, center, was an All-American at Virginia, while Lindsey Horan, right, bypassed college to play professionally in Europe.

It can't hurt that they like each other too. Theirs is not chemistry of short-term convenience, but rather, one forged through years of friendship -- the kind that not so long ago allowed Brian to admit to Horan that she didn't really like her that much when they first met.

Horan was the newcomer back then, talented enough to move up an age level and join a team attempting to qualify for the Under-17 World Cup in 2010. Brian was the name younger players spoke almost reverentially. She intimidated Horan.

But when the new kid is already bigger than most of her elders, quiet is easily misinterpreted.

I'm so proud of her because I think she maybe became one of the best players in the world. French national team member Jessica Houara, who was Horan's teammate at PSG

As Brian said of her recent revelation, ""I did tell her that she came off -- because she was quiet and just the way she was carrying herself in the beginning -- it seemed like she was a little cocky.""

Even so, the friendship that soon developed was sound enough that not only did Horan seek advice when she made the decision to bypass college, but also Brian was honest enough to say she thought it would be a mistake.

""I was thinking, at that point in time, that a college education with a scholarship is something you don't pass up,"" Brian said. ""In this day and age, we don't make millions of dollars.""

Ticketed for stardom even before she was the national high school athlete of the year, Brian chose which college to attend -- not whether she would attend. With her time split between Virginia and the national team and still credits shey of graduation (she insists that will happen this year), her path was nevertheless always going to be the same as that of Michelle Akers at UCF, Mia Hamm at North Carolina, Wambach at Florida and Morgan at Cal.

""College was the best four years of my life so far,"" Brian said. ""For me, it was so much fun. I met some of my best friends and had the best experience. I wouldn't trade that experience for anything else. I think that's a huge part of it -- not only the soccer part but also the life experience that you get.""

U.S. Soccer Lindsey Horan scored 31 goals in 38 games in her first two season with Paris Saint-Germain.

There were experiences that Horan found too. With her eyes opened by the opportunity to train with another French team while in high school, she took a road never traveled by Americans when she chose a reported six-figure contract with Paris Saint-German over the University of North Carolina. Long before she played for her country, Horan had to keep up with the proven world-class professionals around her, including a sizable chunk of the French national team.

""I think a lot of people develop that maturity and that understanding when they're in college,"" Horan said. ""I think going overseas and experiencing a whole new culture is something you can't learn anywhere else. I was thrown into a position where I had to learn a new language, become professional and not be just that child anymore coming into a team. I was able to learn from players that were so experienced at such a high level. You can't get that anywhere else. Nothing against college, but you can't get that in college ...

""Putting me into training sessions playing against players that were 10 years older, that were way more experienced and, honestly, way better, it was a big shock for me.""

U.S. Soccer Lindsey Horan (with her mom, Linda, at the Eiffel Tower) didn't get the typical college experience. Instead, she lived in a foreign country, played with world-class professionals and learned a new language.

The experiences weren't confined to her development on the field. Horan was living and working in and around Paris when the city was attacked in November 2015. One of her teammates was in the stands at the men's soccer match between France and Germany that was an intended target of the terrorists.

Horan watched the news unfold from her apartment, too scared to go out in her community beyond central Paris in the days that followed. Yet she was on the field when PSG became the first professional team in Paris, men or women, to play after the attacks, in a Champions League game five days.

It was too soon, nerves still too frayed and stress too palpable to play a game. In that setting, soccer became a job. Like so many Parisians, Horan went back to work and tried to cope. But in a different country and language, even an act as mundane as shopping for groceries could become a test of patience and resolve. The club offered a support network, of course, but not a cocoon. It expected her to be an adult.

It proved strange at first to talk to friends back home and hear their stories of college life. She took some online courses early in her time in France and tried to pretend it was the same. But it wasn't. She wasn't studying abroad. She was an expatriate, a professional athlete, an adult among adults such as Jessica Houara, a veteran defender for both PSG and the French national team.

""It was like a little child because she was just 18, she was like a baby in a new country,"" said Houara, with a big smile on her face at the mention of Horan. ""But she grew up and grew up and grew up. I was so impressed [by] her.""

She has moved into the midfield seamlessly, and I think that's a testament to all the work she has done in the past five years. Morgan Brian on Lindsey Horan's move from forward to midfielder

Horan's maturity is evident on the field. Known as a forward who was occasionally pushed out wide in a loaded PSG lineup, she took on the challenge U.S. coach Jill Ellis and her staff handed her during the team's otherwise ill-fated December trip to Hawaii, and she thrived. That's not to say the transformation is complete or permanent, but the early returns are all positive.

""Her body changed a lot since four years,"" Houara said. ""She works a lot for that, and now she's a real athlete -- a real good football player but a real athlete. I'm not surprised that she's playing with the national team and plays a lot. I can't wait to see her play midfield because I think she has the heart to play midfield, she has the vision and the technique, for sure. So I can't wait to see her. I'm so proud of her because I think she maybe became one of the best players in the world.""

During the CONCACAF tournament, Costa Rican veteran Shirley Cruz, another of Horan's teammates at PSG, said she was proud of how much Horan had grown over the past three-plus years. She added that she expected her to be ""the next Abby Wambach"" for the United States. Although less glamorous, it is hardly less impressive that she is progressing so capably toward being the next Holiday.

""The Lindsey I knew five years ago wouldn't have been able to change to a different position like that,"" Brian said. ""It's a different world playing center forward to center midfield. The running, the physical ability, everything, it's different. But she has moved into the midfield seamlessly, and I think that's a testament to all the work she has done in the past five years.""

AP Photo/David J. Phillip Morgan Brian, who has 48 caps with the national team, now helps anchor the U.S. central midfield with Lindsey Horan, who has 11 caps.

Like many, Ellis was surprised when Horan chose Europe over college.

""The college route has always been a safe environment and one that is certainly well-known,"" Ellis said. ""For her to take a different path, I thought, was incredibly brave.""

Professionally and personally, Ellis has an understanding of both sides of the debate. By her own admission, the former coach at college powerhouse UCLA probably would not have attended university had she remained in her native England -- not so much out of hardship as because of different cultural norms relating to the idea of post-secondary education as panacea. Ellis acknowledges that at least for a select few, Horan will become more model than anomaly. That almost came true in recent weeks, with speculation that Pugh, still a high school senior, would pass up a scholarship at UCLA to play in the NWSL.

Horan said she offered what advice she could -- not for the first time -- to a promising young player. But if it's not Pugh, it will be someone else. The economics of women's soccer suggest it will be a trickle, rather than a wave, but someone will follow Horan's lead. It might turn out worse for them than it did for her, just as college has failed to serve some through the years.

""I think that's part of the evolution of our sport,"" Ellis said of the developmental avenues. ""For us to evolve, there's got to continue to be options available. It's up to the individual to determine which option is the right one for them.""

At 18, Horan traded home for the unknown. When she returned more than three years later, she traded one home for another. Leaving that brings into focus what it meant and what will be missed.

""The main thing is my teammates,"" Horan said. ""It's really hard, I developed such amazing relationships over there, and you don't really realize that until you're back, and you're missing them. I miss a lot about Paris. After three and a half years, you get a little sick of it, and you just want to be home. But there are little things, sights. Like seeing the Eiffel Tower every day, that's kind of cool.""

Substitute Charlottesville for Paris, and substitute The Lawn, the grassy area at the heart of the school Thomas Jefferson founded, for the Eiffel Tower, and the words could belong to Brian.

That each found her way here appears to the best thing for the national team. It will be up to those who come after to decide which path to follow.",[]

He explained at this week's WGC-Cadillac Championship that it was a few mental errors that kept him from playing the weekend at the Honda Classic. (1:41)

DORAL, Fla. -- Here's how you know you've finally made it as one of the world's best golfers.

When asked about your impending on-course strategies, you don't harp on consistency or gradual improvement or treating every round as if it's the most important one you'll ever play.

Instead, you echo this sentiment, one which has become a rallying cry for elite players in recent years:

""I want my game to peak four times per year.""

These times, of course, are the 16 days during which the major championships will be contested.

If you're one of these players almost wholly focused on the big events, you might also add, ""Well, five times this year, since it's a Ryder Cup year.""

If you really want to be politically correct, you'll stop yourself and claim, ""Actually, six times this year, because of the Olympics.""

Tiger Woods didn't invent this concept; he just vocalized it more than anyone before him. He popularized the idea that insisting the majors meant more to him didn't mean every other tournament meant nothing.

Editor's Picks Sobel: Length and picking precision key for Doral Golfers have to be precise and avoid pitfalls at Doral this week if they hope to contend at the WGC-Cadillac Championship. DFS players must do the same for this unique event.

WGC-Cadillac Championship leaderboard Rory McIlroy made just a single bogey in the final round, relinquishing a 3-shot lead to finish tied for third at Doral.

Easy for him to say. Woods has famously won 14 career majors, but he also owns a not-too-shabby total of 65 other PGA Tour titles, which either negates his claim about peaking during those four times per year or serves as explanation for just how dominant he really was. Maybe it's both.

Whether they outwardly incorporate such major peaking as part of their game plans or simply hope the cyclical nature of the game reaches high tide during these weeks, Jordan Spieth, Jason Day and Rory McIlroy adhere to the mindset that majors take on greater importance than everything else.

The world's top three golfers, who will play the first two rounds of this week's WGC-Cadillac Championship together (beginning at 11:32 a.m. ET on Thursday), haven't exactly started off the year like 18-handicappers. They've combined for six top-10s in a dozen worldwide starts so far, with Spieth's victory at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions serving as their lone title.

Even so, they haven't yet hit their peaks, with Spieth and McIlroy each missing the cut in their last start, and Day failing to finish better than 10th place.

In the aftermath, they've been subject to analysis, scrutiny and even criticism.

All of which raises a major -- emphasis on major -- question: If a player wants his game to peak four times per year, but he isn't peaking now and this isn't one of those times, then doesn't that sort of follow the blueprint?

""We would argue that you want to peak each and every four tournament rounds that you play,"" Spieth explained. ""You obviously want to feel like you're gearing up for the majors, but a lot of times you're coming off an offseason. Or you get to events where you feel like you just haven't put the exact amount of work in that you had put before a major, because you can't do it every single week. It's not physically possible.""

Even the concept of trying to peak during just those four weeks is a secret without an answer.

""I don't know, man, you tell me,"" Day said with a laugh, ""because I'm still trying to work it out.""

He then echoed Spieth's thoughts.

""Obviously, I want to peak every week. That would be great. Try and win every week.""

The truth is, early-year stumbles can be beneficial to a player's performances at the majors.

At least, that's McIlroy's sentiment in the wake of a missed cut at last week's Honda Classic.

""Sometimes it's not a bad thing, because in a way you can sort of hit the reset button and sit down and analyze, 'What's going on here? What do I have to get right?'"" he said. ""It's nice to get it out of the way early in the year, so when I get to the bulk of the season, I know what I've needed to work on and hopefully I've sorted those problems out. I can get into the meat of the season and know I've got all of the rustiness and mental errors out of the way.""

In other words, he'll trade another week of imprecise drives and balky putts here at Trump National Doral if it means his game is firing on all cylinders come Masters week.

They all will, really.

That doesn't mean McIlroy, Day, Spieth or any other top player in this week's field doesn't want to peak this week; it just means they really want to peak five weeks from now, after making that drive down Magnolia Lane.

As Spieth summed it up: ""What do I make of not playing great, but it not being a major? Fortunate that it's not a major.""",[]

FanDuel will suspend offering paid contests in May as part of the settlement with Paxton. In return, the attorney general's office will not pursue any legal action against FanDuel.

There was no settlement with DraftKings, however. The site filed suit against Paxton on Friday in Texas state court in an effort to prevent him from taking action ""to eliminate daily fantasy sports contests"" and seek declaratory judgment that the DFS contests are legal under Texas law.

The escalation comes roughly six weeks after Paxton issued an opinion stating the daily fantasy contests violated state law.

""We look forward to presenting evidence to demonstrate that Daily Fantasy Sports are skill-based games and perfectly legal under Texas law, certainly no less so than other kinds of skill-based contests,"" DraftKings counsel Randy Mastro said in a statement announcing the suit. ""We are committed to ensuring that our fans can continue to enjoy the contests they love.""

FanDuel will cease paid operations in Texas in May, but said it ""will work to pass legislation that protects fantasy sports and consumers so that we can bring our paid contests back to Texans as soon as possible."" Scott Olson/Getty Images

Paxton's office did not immediately return a request for comment regarding DraftKings' suit, but commended FanDuel for ""responsibly and proactively"" working to reach the settlement.

""This will spare both the company and the taxpayers of Texas the expense of an extensive lawsuit that I believe would only affirm what my office has already determined,"" Paxton said in a statement.

FanDuel informed Texas users that it would suspend offering paid contests beginning May 1 and that users could withdraw funds at any time.

""We believe FanDuel has always been legal in Texas and strongly disagree with the recent advisory opinion of the Attorney General, but understand that the laws surrounding fantasy sports require clarity,"" the site wrote in an email to users.

""The Texas legislature will be in session in 2017 and we will work to pass legislation that protects fantasy sports and consumers so that we can bring our paid contests back to Texans as soon as possible.""

In its suit filed Friday in the District Court of Dallas County, Texas, DraftKings said the state is one of its three largest markets. Texas users were responsible for $179.6 million in daily fantasy entry fees in 2015, according research firm Eilers & Krejcik Gaming.

Texas is among several states to have issued opinions on the legality of daily fantasy sports. Attorneys general in Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi and New York also have said daily fantasy violates state gambling laws. Nevada has said daily fantasy requires a gambling license to operate. FanDuel and DraftKings also are in legal battles in New York and Illinois.

FanDuel has a sponsorship deal with the Dallas Mavericks. DraftKings has sponsorship deals with the Dallas Cowboys and Texas Rangers.

The bill requires operators to register with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services and pay a $50,000 licensing fee. Among other regulations, participants must be 18 or older, and employees of the sites and their family members are prohibited from playing.

""This bill, which was passed by super majorities of both chambers, will empower Virginia to regulate this emerging industry and keep consumers safe from abuses,"" Brian Coy, spokesman for the governor's office, said in an emailed statement.

Leading daily fantasy sports operators DraftKings and FanDuel praised Virginia's approach.

""Governor McAuliffe and members of the Virginia legislature took a thoughtful, deliberative approach to establishing a law that safeguards fantasy sports while installing consumer protections,"" Cory Fox, counsel for FanDuel, said. ""Virginia showed real leadership in being the first state to pass smart regulations this year, and we hope to see more states follow Virginia's lead in the months ahead.""

Approximately two dozen states are considering fantasy sports legislation, and a bill has reached the desk of Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Other states have found that daily fantasy sports violate state gambling laws.

Last week, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton reached a settlement with FanDuel that will result in the site's ceasing to offer paid games in the Lone Star State in May. DraftKings filed suit against Paxton and has asked for a declaratory judgment to clarify its legality. DraftKings and FanDuel are also in legal battles with attorneys general in New York and Illinois. Attorneys general in Hawaii, Mississippi and Georgia have released opinions that daily fantasy violates their states' gambling laws.

DraftKings said it is ""hopeful that other states across the country will follow Virginia's lead.""

Not all fantasy companies were as pleased with the Virginia bill as DraftKings and FanDuel. The Fantasy Sports Trade Association, in an email to members, acknowledged it also had concerns about the bills in Virginia and Indiana, specifically the $50,000 licensing fee.

""Both states have an onerous mandatory regulation fee that makes both states untenable for the majority of the FSTA's members,"" the FSTA wrote. ""We are deeply concerned that these states have made it impossible for so many of our member companies to do business. The FSTA will work toward improving those bills as quickly as possible.""

Seth Young, vice president and COO of Stars Fantasy Leagues tweeted that he believes the bill didn't represent the interests of the industry, only FanDuel and DraftKing.

""It will be interesting to see how many DFS operators step up to register. We certainly will,"" said Joe Brennan, CEO of FastFantasy, a new daily fantasy site. ""One thing to keep in mind, regulatory laws rarely stay static.

Published Feb. 21, 2016

Rumors are flying that Bjarne Riis is poised to link up with Bahrain to underwrite a new cycling team for 2017.

A few things line up to give the speculation some added credence. First, Riis and Saxo Bank associate Lars Seier Christensen are scheduled to hold a press conference Thursday in Copenhagen. Second, the crown prince of Bahrain posted on his Facebook account Sunday evening that a Bahrain Cycling Team is coming soon. Rumors that Riis recently traveled to the Middle Eastern kingdom only fuel speculation that Thursdays announcement could see Riiss re-entry into the peloton.

Heres what Bahrains crown prince Nasser Bin Hamad posted on Facebook: Its real! I would like to officially announce the birth of Bahrain cycling team. Our main effort is to introduce the cycling sport, encourage and support young athletes, to maintain a healthy lifestyle in our region, and to compete with the best teams in the world.

Its that last phrase thats sparking interest. Riis has made it no secret that hes in the market to return to the peloton following his bitter exit from Tinkoff-Saxo last spring when team owner Oleg Tinkov sacked him. Saxo Bank ended its sponsorship with Tinkov last year, and Seier Christensen is once again cooking something up with Riis.

Its not yet known exactly what Riis and Seier Christensen will unveil Thursday. The press conference was planned weeks ago, and there is speculation it could be nothing more than an announcement their intention of getting something going. Reports in Danish media that Riis recently traveled to Bahrain, however, have fueled speculation there could be something more substantial.

Whats behind Bahrains interest in cycling? Located just off the coast from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain is certainly flush enough with petrodollars to sponsor a major European bike team. A slumping oil market could reduce the flow of government largesse, but like its neighbors in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain has tried to diversify its economy. The island nation has been marred with violent protests since the Arab spring in 2011, but the royal family has retained its grip on power.

Its interest in endurance sports is nothing new. This year, Bahrain backed an elite professional triathlon team, called Bahrain Endurance 13 Team featuring several top triathletes, and the crown prince is active in endurance sports.

Bahrain seems to be taking a page out of the recent cycling boom across the oil-rich region. Bike races attract top stars in Qatar, Oman, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi, while Dubai also backs its own cycling team.

Whether or not Riis links up with Bahrain will be revealed Thursday, but it comes just as there are moves to create other new teams for 2017. Tinkoff is already confirmed to be leaving the peloton, but team general manager Stefano Feltrin is hunting for new sponsors to take over the team. Alberto Contador (Tinkoff) has also revealed his intentions of trying to find sponsors to create a new Spanish team for 2017.

Sharapova revealed Monday she had failed a test for meldonium, a substance she had been taking legally taken for 10 years to deal with health issues, such as an irregular heartbeat and a history of diabetes in her family.

But meldonium was added to the WADA banned list at the start of 2016 because of ""evidence of its use by athletes with the intention of enhancing performance.""

Pound said he could not fathom how Sharapova allowed herself to be in this situation given the high stakes involved, both professionally and financially.

""Running a $30 million business depends on you staying eligible to play tennis. You are taking something on a list, which you have known about for four months. I am sorry, that is a big mistake -- of course she should have known,"" Pound said in an interview with BBC Sport.

""She is taking something that is not generally permitted in her country of residence [the United States] for medical purposes, so she says, so there must be a doctor following this.""

Sharapova, 28, is waiting to hear what sanctions she will face from the International Tennis Federation, which informed her of the positive test on March 2 and confirmed she would be provisionally suspended from March 12 pending an independent tribunal to hear the case.

Sharapova faces a ban of up to four years, but could receive some leniency if she can prove she needed to take the drug for medical purposes.

She said she had not read the updated list of banned substances sent to athletes in December and took ""full responsibility"" for her actions.

""Any time there is a change to the list, notice is given on 30 September prior to the change. You have October, November, December to get off what you are doing,"" Pound told BCC Sport. ""All the tennis players were given notification of it and she has a medical team somewhere. That is reckless beyond description.""

Sharapova will also face a battle to win back lucrative endorsement contracts.

According to Forbes, Sharapova earned some 21 million ($30 million) in 2015, making her the highest-earning female athlete in the world for the past 11 years, with her off-court endorsements dwarfing her income from prize money.

espn.com,,Kara Goucher on U.S. Anti-Doping Agency investigation into Alberto Salazar -- 'justice will come',"['Sue Mott', 'One Naci N', 'Gordon Simpson', 'Pa Sport', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Bonnie D', 'Wayne Drehs', 'Espn Staff', 'Johnette Howard', 'Jim Caple']","LOS ANGELES -- Kara Goucher, who fell one spot shy of making the U.S. Olympic marathon team in Saturday's trials, said ""justice will come"" out of an ongoing U.S. Anti-Doping Agency investigation of her former coach Alberto Salazar and his Nike Oregon Project group.

Goucher, a 2012 Olympian in the marathon and a two-time world bronze medalist on the track, and her husband, Adam, a former distance runner, were the most high-profile named sources in a 2015 investigation by ProPublica and BBC that alleged Salazar flouted and manipulated anti-doping regulations. Salazar issued a 12,000-word open letter in response, denying any wrongdoing.

After Saturday's race, in an interview by reporters that was filmed by letsrun.com, Goucher calmly said, ""I've done all I can do at this point. I believe in Travis [Tygart, head of USADA]. I don't wish them ill will. The first time I went to USADA I said, 'All I want them to do is stop doing what they're doing.'""

Goucher finished a painful 14th at the 2014 New York City Marathon and underwent meniscus surgery in January 2015. At 37, some observers considered her a long shot for the 2016 Olympic team. But she stayed close enough to keep the top three women on guard in the late going and finished just over two minutes behind winner Amy Cragg on a warm day in downtown Los Angeles.

""People ask, 'How did you come back?' Letting go of that s--- is how I came back,"" Goucher said, referring to unburdening herself about her time with Salazar and their subsequent war of words. ""I lost 200 pounds of f---ing baggage I've been carrying around. They can't touch me anymore.

""Do you think everything I know came out in the BBC documentary? There will be a day.""

To a separate group of reporters, including ESPN.com, Goucher said, ""What I'm proudest of is the last year, speaking out against what I saw in the sport. Not backing down, and coming back against all odds.""

Her comments came on a day when a Salazar-coached athlete who was at the focus of the ProPublica/BBC probe, 2012 Olympic 10,000-meter silver medalist Galen Rupp, won the men's trials in 2 hours, 11 minutes, 12 seconds in his marathon debut.

Informed of that win in the finish-line media interview area, Goucher said, ""I'm not really surprised. I ran for Alberto for seven years. He doesn't have you run if you're not ready. Hopefully, [Rupp] did it the right way.""

Rupp was asked about Goucher's comments in a packed news conference and responded, ""I think all I can say is, I've always been an advocate for clean sport, and I've worked really hard over the years to get where I'm at today, and I'm cooperating with whatever officials I need to cooperate with.""

Salazar was similarly concise when approached by ESPN.com and one other reporter and said he was not surprised at Goucher's comments.

""We made our statement,"" Salazar said. ""We're concerned with Rio at this point. We're moving forward.""

Goucher spoke publicly about the allegations at last year's U.S. Track and Field championships and urged others who might have knowledge to come forward, then said she would no longer comment in order to allow the investigation to proceed unimpeded.

Cragg won Saturday's race in 2:28:29. Desiree Linden and a heat-depleted Shalane Flanagan earned the other two spots on the women's team. Athens 2004 silver medalist Meb Keflezighi, 40, qualified for his third Olympic marathon, and Jared Ward took the third slot for the men.

Linden's coach, Kevin Hanson, said it did not bother him to hear questions about the investigation on a day of celebration for those six runners.

""You have to expect those questions every single time,"" Hanson said. ""I don't know if [the allegations] are accurate, but our sport looks silly if we avoid them.""",[]

I'm not going to beat around the bush here -- Chinese teams have been terrible these past few months. They entered the 2015 World Championships in Europe as the odds-on favorite region to have a team lift the Summoner's Cup, but what occurred instead was nothing short of a disaster. Domestic champion and supposed titan LGD Gaming embarrassed themselves in the group stages, and failed to even make it into the top eight. Even their team's most consistent squad, Edward Gaming, couldn't pick up a win in the top eight, as they got swept by Fnatic to eliminate the entire nation of China from the tournament in its earliest stages.

Things only got worse when LGD traveled to IEM San Jose, vowing they would prove their strength and gain redemption for themselves on an international stage. LGD's plan to bring back some respect back to the regopm was a complete failure, with the team dropping out of the tournament in straight losses. The Chinese teams, which had spent the most money in 2015 to compete with the South Korean region, in terms of infrastructure development and big player signings, had been left with nothing to show for their investments.

Royal Never Give Up had a similar narrative heading into IEM Katowice. They're atop Group B in LPL's two conference system, and boast an impressive lineup led by one of game's all-time greats, Cho ""Mata"" Se-hyeong, in the in-game leader role. It's a team built on [a lot of] money, explosive offense, and immense skill. Expected to make it to at least the semifinals, anything but a top four finish would be considered another international folly for China.

Fortunately for the proud fans of China, RNG did what LGD could not last IEM -- bring a bit of pride back to their region. Royal might not be the best team in the world when it comes to the macro-sense of the game, sometimes looking lost in terms of objective control in their game against Origen, but they more than make up for it with their skirmishing prowess and technical skill. RNG's jungler, Liu ""Mlxg"" Shiyu, is the player with the greatest chance to breakout as a household name this event, as he's the key to whether or not Royal can take home the championship. The Chinese jungler leads all players at his position in the LPL when it comes to kills, and RNG rewards their ace jungler with a hefty percentage of the team's gold in-game to get him rolling. If Mlxg can find relevance in the early-game, or can farm steadily into Royal's favorite objective of Baron Nashor, then the two-time Summoner's Cup runners-up might very be seeing gold on Sunday.

Is China back to the reverence it was given before the 2015 Worlds? Not even close. But, as their apt name would suggest, the former Royal Club is not giving up on bringing back the respect to China's LPL.

Loser: (Not) Happily EVER After

The plucky underdogs from Korea's minor leagues saw their fairytale come crashing down in flames on opening day. Their luck seemed to be continuing when Team SoloMid botched a 10k gold lead in the first game of the day, but EVER followed that fluky victory with three straight losses to get knocked out of the tournament.

EVER made it to Katowice through smart drafting and finely-tuned synergy that made them appear wise beyond their years, and the team was at their absolute best when they could capitalize on mistakes from their opponents -- using global ultimates and teleports to force opportune fights when their enemy made a small mistake. While not being in Korea's premier league, LCK, there was an aspect about them that made you believe they might have the potential to win IEM Katowice in an upset.

Sadly, fairytales aren't often real, and EVER's hopes of winning a major tournament as a minor league team weren't either. Outside of their AD carry, Lee ""LoKeN"" Dong-wook, the squad played like what they are: a Challenger team that has some good talent on the squad, but needs a lot more practice and time to be anything more on a consisten basis. On the plus side LoKeN, in their one win against TSM, was world-class on his Lucian -- dipping in and out on the agile champion with multi-kills even when his team was down a massive amount of gold.

Everyone else, including EVER's rookie phenom at the support role, Kim ""KeY"" Han-gi, looked lost against the major league teams in their group. KeY's signature Bard lost all of its luster during Friday's games, with the young support player consistently making illogical mistakes in their deciding match series in a rematch with TSM. The team was out of their depth, and it showed through in their spotty, inflexible play.

Winner: The Bjergsen and Doublelift Show

TSM were on their way to being the big losers for the day after just one game. The team had a 10k gold lead and a Yiliang ""Doublelift"" Peng Pentakill, but the team still lost the game through indecision as TSM fractured under the pressure. Individually the team did great, as the all-star lineup of TSM performed as promoted -- they got a lot of early-game kills, looked flashy at times and dominated the opponent. The issue here, though, was that their late-game was still splintered as badly as it was last year, with their constant dancing around Baron and lack of decisiveness allowing the teamfighting-happy EVER back into the game.

Their lower bracket match against Origen wasn't all that clean, either. It took a heroic effort from Bjergsen -- believe me, I know one when I see one as I wrote this line a lot in 2015 -- for TSM to get out of their dogfight with the equally troubled Origen from Europe. It wasn't until their rematch with EVER, another team that was having trouble adapting to the international stage, where TSM began to play like you'd expect on paper from a starting five like theirs.

In six games Bjergsen went 35/10/42, with Doublelift going 31/17/46. Together, the double carry core of SoloMid accounted for over 60 percent of the team's overall damage -- and they both went over 670 damage per minute in those games. These are the types of numbers that TSM fans salivated over during the offseason when it announced that one of the best western AD carries of all time would be joining the two-time NA LCS MVP and consensus best player in North America, Bjergsen, on the same squad.

As long as TSM can come together when it matters, that being their late-game shotcalling, this work-in-progress lineup could mature faster than once thought. Before I call all of TSM winners, though, let's see how they do in a possible SK Telecom T1 or Qiao Gu Reapers semifinal match on Sunday, shall we?

Loser: Origen in Stagnation

Origen's struggles could be stretched out into a full-fledged article of its own. The closest thing we can compare Origen's faltering this split to would be Cloud9 from North America last year, when they dropped their captain Hai ""Hai"" Lam in favor or a more mechanically-gifted mid laner in Nicolaj ""Jensen"" Jensen. The team flatlined without their in-game leader in the center of the lineup, and it wasn't too long before Hai returned to the team as jungler. With his help, and Jensen's evolution as a mid laner, the team went to Worlds last year -- and now it's faring well in the NA LCS' regular season.

The Worlds semifinalists had their captain and mid laner, Enrique ""xPeke"" Cedeno Martinez, step back from the starting five in the offseason and become a substitute. He was replaced by another young European talent who was considered an upgrade when it came to mechanics, that being former Unicorns of Love mid Tristan ""PowerOfEvil"" Schrage. The results so far have been completely average -- not good enough to contend with the top teams in Europe (and internationally), but good enough to keep afloat over the bottom four teams in the EU LCS.

IEM Katowice was a mirror image of their games in Europe. They were steamrolled by a tournament favorite in RNG, and they had a close losing effort to TSM in a match between two teams that have teetered around average this season in their respective leagues.

Will things change with the postseason a few short weeks ahead? Will they go the Cloud9 route and bring back Xpeke to see if his leadership can relight the spark for the team? All we know is that, currently, with the team's starting five and form, this Origen squad will have trouble going very far this spring playoffs.",[]

espn.com,,Chavez Sr. worried about Junior's lack of discipline,"['Salvador Rodriguez', 'Brian Campbell', 'Alfredo R']","LOS ANGELES -- Former middleweight titlist Julio Cesar Chavez Jr. unexpectedly left his training camp in Big Bear Mountain in California during the weekend and his father, Julio Cesar Chavez Sr. said hes worried about his sons lack of discipline and that he may be on a rocky road.

I dont know what happened, Im extremely disappointed, sad and very worried about his indiscipline, said Chavez Sr., who first broke the news Monday on ESPN Deportes' A Los Golpes show. Really, he was training very hard at Big Bear and all of a sudden he left, he came down.

Chavez Sr. said he was concerned that Chavez Jr. leaving camp -- where he's been training for a fight tentatively set for April 30 challenging super middleweight titlist Badou Jack -- was not just to take a break from his training. Chavez Jr. had been training for weeks at Big Bear under the supervision of trainer Robert Garcia, who was at his corner for his previous fight against Marcos Reyes in July.

I dont think he left to do good things, said Chavez Sr. That worries, stresses me.

Chavez Jr. posted a photo on his Instagram account on the Santa Monica coastline later in the afternoon and told ESPN Digital Salvador Rodriguez that he never ""escaped"" camp, but went to Los Angeles to check his heel with a doctor and later went to the beach to run.

I dont know what happened, I dont know why he said that. I came down from Big Bear to Los Angeles to check on my heel, then later went and ran in Santa Monica, I took the time to see my daughter and Im returning to do sparring because my heel feels better, said Chavez Jr. Maybe he got mad because I dont do things as he likes to. I respect him because hes my father, but Im 30 years old.

Chavez Jr., who has had problems making weight in recent fights, has twice failed drug tests and been suspended. He was also arrested for a DUI a few weeks before a 2012 middleweight title defense.

Chavez Sr. said on A Los Golpes that he preferred that his son retire from boxing and that the proposed fight against Jack be cancelled.

If this boy, my son, continues with this lack of discipline, his lack of responsibility ... Id rather have him retire, that he not fight, Chavez Sr. added. This kid wants to do what he wants, train what he wants, at the time he wants. Im disappointed of his (lack) of discipline, his apathy.

The legendary Mexican boxer said he cant cover up any more the problems that his son has regarding discipline inside and outside the ring and that he will immediately stop helping him on his training if the Jack fight is still on. Sources have said that the fight would be announced Friday and that Texas is the leading candidate to host the event.

""I cant cover up any more, I cant keep on faking that Julio is the same person of old and that breaks me,"" said Chavez Sr. ""His lack of discipline, trying to do things his way ... that I dont agree.""

Chavez Jr. said that he would keep going down to the beach one or two days a week to combine his training in the mountains, Monday through Saturday, with exercises at sea level.

... I have not failed. I know this fight can change the history of what has happened, all bad things are behind me, said Chavez Jr., who is with powerful advisor Al Haymon.

Chavez Sr. said he will continue to watch over his son as a father, but that he knows where he can wind up if things go wrong.

I hope ... We will wait. For now, Ill take some distance from him, said Chavez Sr. He had asked me to be there and help him ... I cant be there covering up, Ill keep away from him. If hes going to misbehave, to do things the wrong way, he knows where he will wind up.

espn.com,,"Baltimore Orioles, Pedro Alvarez agree to 1-year contract",[],"The Baltimore Orioles have agreed to terms with Pedro Alvarez on a one-year deal worth $5.75 million, sources confirmed to ESPN's Jim Bowden.

Editor's Picks Pedro Alvarez gives Orioles another lefty bat, muddies OF picture By adding former Pirate Pedro Alvarez, the Baltimore Orioles now have six players who have hit 30 home runs in a season. But where will they all play?

Hard choices for the O's attached to Pedro Alvarez signing Buster Olney looks at the lineup dilemma the Orioles have now that they reportedly will sign Pedro Alvarez; plus Jhonny Peralta replacement options. 1 Related

The $5.75 million matches how much Alvarez made last year while playing for the Pittsburgh Pirates, who elected not to give him a contract after last season.

Alvarez could earn an additional $1.25 million in performance bonuses based on plate appearances: $200,000 each for 350, 400, 450, 500 and 550, and $250,000 for 600.

Alvarez, who had an MLB-high 23 errors in his first full season at first base last season, is expected to serve as a designated hitter for the Orioles.

His arrival probably means Mark Trumbo will play right field.

He finished 10th in the National League with 27 home runs last season and tied for the NL lead with 36 home runs in 2013, when he was an All-Star. However, the Pirates balked at having to pay a projected $8.1 million in salary for 2016.

Alvarez has 131 homers in six major league seasons. Besides his 27 homers, he hit .243 with 77 RBIs and 131 strikeouts last season.

The left-handed-hitting Alvarez, who turned 29 on Feb. 6, was the second overall pick in the 2008 draft.

espn.com,,Boston Celtics coach Brad Stevens dreams of schemes,"['Tim Macmahon', 'Nick Friedell', 'Dave Mcmenamin', 'Anthony Olivieri', 'Michael C', 'Royce Young', 'Kevin Arnovitz', 'Espn Com', 'Chris Forsberg', 'Zach Lowe']","Maybe it was Kelly Olynyk that jogged Brad Stevens' memory. Or maybe it was the game clock.

The Boston Celtics owned a double-digit lead with 4.7 seconds to play in the first half of a January tilt with the Memphis Grizzlies. Many coaches would have been content to let their teams inbound the ball and race up the court for a desperation heave. But Stevens, armed with a timeout and his trusty whiteboard, was reminded of a full-court play he had run three years earlier at Butler University in a game against Gonzaga. It fizzled that day, though his Bulldogs, down one with 4.6 seconds to play before getting whistled for a traveling violation, still prevailed over Olynyk's Zags on a miracle steal and buzzer-beater combo. Stevens figured that play might actually work this time.

Olynyk set a screen that allowed Isaiah Thomas to catch an inbounds feed from Jae Crowder with momentum. Grizzlies center Marc Gasol alertly read the play and shuffled over to trap Thomas near midcourt, while Olynyk received a back pick from Avery Bradley near the center stripe and started racing down the opposite side of the floor.

Thomas managed to feed the ball ahead to Evan Turner, who quickly flipped it to the streaking Olynyk for a two-handed dunk -- and 15-point lead -- with 0.6 seconds remaining.

""I was joking with Kelly. I said, 'We would have beat you the first time when [Butler] played Gonzaga, but [Alex] Barlow, who is [one of Boston's video assistants], traveled,'"" Stevens said. ""You always look for what you could maybe run in certain situations.""

Stevens, leaning on a seemingly encyclopedic knowledge of potential sets and actions, has quickly distinguished himself as a maestro of the dry-erase board at the NBA level. At least once per game, he seems to draw up something that generates a key basket for his team, often in a crunch-time situation.

In Boston's past 26 games, a span in which the team owns a 19-7 record while moving 12 games above .500 overall and surging toward the top of the Eastern Conference, the Celtics are averaging 0.962 points per play on after-timeout plays, according to Synergy Sports data. That's a number that, if maintained, would rank the Celtics second in the league behind only Gregg Popovich's San Antonio Spurs (0.979 ppp).

Told that his name is now invoked in discussions about the best in-game X's and O's coaches in the league, Stevens downplayed such praise.

Editor's Picks Boston brain trust: C's Thomas seeks Brady chat Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas said he wants to pick the brain of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.

Sullinger out of hospital following skin infection Celtics forward/center Jared Sullinger was hospitalized earlier this week because of a skin infection, but he may be ready to play in Boston's game against the Grizzlies on Wednesday. 1 Related

""Honest to God, I've stolen everything we've ever done from somebody else,"" he said. ""Now, it may not be exactly what they do, but it may be, 'Oh, I really like that action. This is how it fits with us.' We may need to position one of other players somewhere else, but I think they are all -- none of it is original. If anything, I watch film.""

Sure, but all coaches watch film, and few of them display Stevens' creativity. Heck, Popovich admitted earlier this season during a visit to Boston that he still watches Butler game tapes to try to glean some of Stevens' secrets. At All-Star weekend in Toronto last month, Popovich doubled down on his praise by saying, ""Brad is one of the top coaches in the league. He's a clinician, he's a technician, he's detailed.""

For Stevens, his singular goal is to put his team in the best position to be successful. For 15 possessions per game -- or roughly 16 percent of Boston's total possessions this season -- he gets a chance to sketch a plan of attack. Maybe not surprisingly, Boston's recent ATO efficiency actually exceeds the team's overall offensive efficiency (0.936 points per play) for the season. Something about Stevens' instructions brings a calm confidence to his players, a belief that they will generate points if they simply follow their marching orders.

""Coach just draws a play up, and we execute, for the most part, out of timeouts,"" said All-Star guard Thomas, whose speed and fearlessness Stevens particularly likes to utilize. ""We're poised in those situations. We believe in each other. We're confident in each other. I know when I have the ball, I feel like I can do anything. And my teammates feel the same way. I think we're just getting better in those type of situations, where we're just poised, and we're not in a rush, and everything slows down for us.""

While at Butler, Stevens used to keep pads of paper near each TV in his house so he could sketch out a play that caught his eye during whatever NBA/NCAA/AAU/CYO game he was watching. The luxuries of the NBA have simplified that process. Stevens can email a Celtics video assistant with a request to cut a clip of any play he spots, and it will be added to a marathon edit the team keeps with interesting plays Stevens wants to poach and/or tweak.

How many plays are currently on that reel? ""It's a lot,"" Stevens said. How many can he remember? ""Well, the way that I remember it is, I name them in my own mind. So like my sheet of plays may not make any sense to anyone else, but it's how I remember it in that moment.""

Stevens detailed how he might have a play called ""Korver"" that mimics an action the Hawks ran for Kyle Korver or a play called ""Joerger"" might remind Stevens of something Memphis and coach Dave Joerger run (Stevens singled out Joerger as one of his favorite play-designers; the two teams meet at 7 p.m. Wednesday at TD Garden on ESPN.)

However, ask Stevens to recall his favorite after-timeout draw-up, and he can't single one out.

""The ones that score,"" Stevens said. ""And the ones that don't, I don't care about.""

The secret to a play's success is typically rooted in Stevens' anticipation of how an opponent might react to an action, and that emphasizes his obsessive dedication to watching game film. Often, at the start of a timeout, Stevens will look down the court to confirm the opponent's personnel, then he goes to work sketching a play meant to exploit how he believes the opponent will react to a given action.

Sometimes Stevens doesn't need a timeout to put his players in the proper positions. During a visit to Miami earlier this season, the Celtics got an offensive rebound and reset with Thomas dribbling at the top of the key. Stevens started directing traffic on the floor, moving his players like chess pieces and creating maximum room to operate.

Satisfied with Boston's spacing, Stevens backed up a few steps and put his hands on his knees, then watched the play unfold. Thomas came off a high pick-and-roll with Amir Johnson and -- as Stevens anticipated -- Heat big man Hassan Whiteside started cheating toward the paint in case of a Thomas drive. Jared Sullinger, Whiteside's assignment, stayed planted outside the 3-point arc on the weak side and drilled a wide-open 3-pointer when the ball swung that way.

Boston players are quick to point out that no play, no matter how good the design, can succeed without the players executing and making shots. But there's an unfailing belief that Stevens is going to give Boston the best look possible, and every play he sketches has multiple options so his players always have an alternative if the preferred look is snuffed.

Sometimes the plays Stevens comes up with leave opponents unsure of what's coming. That happened in a game against Minnesota last month as, desperately trying to rally from a four-point deficit in the final seconds, Stevens sketched a sequence in which Boston floated an inbounds lob to Jonas Jerebko near the rim. It was a actually a decoy action, and Bradley soon raced off a Crowder screen for a clean 3-point look.

Stevens loves to use the threat of Thomas as a way to generate open shots for others. There was a sequence late in a game against Utah last month in which a Thomas drive drew multiple defenders, and he kicked back out to a wide-open Crowder for what proved to be the game-winning 3-pointer.

Late in the first quarter of a visit to San Antonio earlier this season, the Spurs were so preoccupied with Thomas as he sprinted toward the sideline that -- with the rest of the floor spread -- initial screener Olynyk took a simple inbounds feed, dribbled once and scored a late first-quarter layup.

After Stevens drew up a winner in which Crowder caught a lob for a last-second layup in Washington, John Wall tipped his cap and showered Stevens in praise.

""He's a hell of a coach, man,"" Wall said. ""He's a young coach, but that's one hell of a coach that knows the game real well. Even at the end of the game, we lined up in different formation that he hadn't seen, and he called out our play before I got the ball. I heard him calling it out.""

Added Wall: ""Stevens does a heck of a job calling stuff that you wouldn't expect. [On Crowder's winning layup,] we all thought it would be a high pick-and-roll to Isaiah Thomas or an [isolation], and he ran a play we weren't expecting.""

For the season, the Celtics rank surprisingly low in after-timeout efficiency, as a result of the team's slow start. Synergy data puts Boston at a mere 0.834 points per play, which ranks 26th overall in the NBA. The four teams below Boston include the league's basement trio of Philadelphia (0.78 ppp), Los Angeles Lakers (0.787) and Phoenix (0.828).

Even so, if Boston struggled earlier in the year, they're a well-oiled machine now. Stevens glows when discussing how the versatility and depth of his roster allow him to get creative when drawing up plays.

""We have an interesting team because I think we'd be hard to prepare for in those moments because we don't always go to the same guy,"" he said. ""And that's a testament to the guys out here because they're all willing to take those shots.""

Why wouldn't they? With help from Stevens, they're usually excellent looks.",[]
espn.com,,Duke Blue Devils among teams to fade in tourney,"['Ben Fawkes', 'David Purdum', 'Darren Rovell', 'Mackenzie Kraemer', 'Steve Fainaru', 'Graham Mckean', 'Arash Markazi', 'Paula Lavigne', 'Ryan Rodenberg', 'Tim Fiorvanti']","If there's one thing the college basketball season has taught us so far, it's that parity rules. There is little, if any, separation at the top on a given Saturday.

Six different teams have been ranked No. 1, none of them holding the spot for more than four total weeks (Michigan State), and the Westgate Las Vegas Superbook doesn't have anyone listed at better than 6-1 to win the title. So doesn't everyone potentially have great value?

With the field this open, there's no single team to garner enough interest in a futures market to distort and lengthen the odds of the teams beneath it. This creates what we have now, which is Vegas essentially saying ""take your best shot."" So there is value if you can nail it spot on, but doing that without backing multiple teams and diluting yourself will be quite difficult.

For the next two weeks, whether you're laying some cash on a future or filling out a bracket in your pool, avoid the following three teams, all of whom have major concerns that will at some point in the tournament impact their title hopes -- and render their current value as nonexistent.

Current Westgate odds: 12-1

The Sooners have far exceeded expectations this season behind Buddy Hield's phenomenal senior campaign, opening the year at 30-1 to win the title yet spending multiple weeks as the No. 1-ranked team in the AP poll. And while Hield is a mortal lock to repeat as Big 12 player of the year (and could win the Wooden Award for top player in the country), he isn't going to dictate Oklahoma's success or failure come tourney time.

Jordan Woodard will, ever so quietly.

With so much of the load on Hield night in and night out, whenever Woodard struggles it becomes difficult for the Sooners to beat solid teams. In his 29 games this season, Oklahoma's record is only 5-3 when he shoots 25 percent or below from the field, what anyone would call a disastrous shooting night, and its record drops to 2-2 when committed facing an RPI Top-50 opponent.

Woodard's Efficiency Carries Weight Woodard FG% Oklahoma v. All Opponents Oklahoma v. RPI Top-50 25.1% or Above 18-3 7-3 25.0% or Below 5-3 2-2

That's not to say Hield won't be important -- he will be. But when dissecting Oklahoma's wins and losses, the difference in Hield's production is negligible. In the Sooners' six defeats he's averaged more points per game (28.2) than he averages for the season (25.4); he just gets there with a slightly worse shooting percentage. Remember his 46 points in the triple-overtime loss at Kansas? Or even his 33 points off 12-of-24 shooting in this past weekend's defeat to the Longhorns in Austin?

To say the team goes as Buddy does isn't really fair or accurate. At this point it's a good bet that he will volume score and do it with at least moderate efficiency. In other words, Hield is going to get his. But if Woodard can't score, Oklahoma's serious lack of depth comes into play and the Sooners have a good chance of losing, especially against the type of talent they will have to face as the tournament progresses. All in all, the Sooners had a productive season, but 12-1 just isn't enough to make me want to back them.

Current odds: 12-1

What Duke has accomplished this season has been impressive. The preseason AP Poll pegged them as No. 5 in the land coming off their national championship, a mark that was in hindsight a bit optimistic following another rendition of their now annual mass exodus to the NBA. Three of their top four scorers in Jahlil Okafor, Justise Winslow and Tyus Jones left early for the Association. The other, Quinn Cook, graduated as a senior.

This left behind a roster that had little depth to begin with, relying on highly touted yet unproven recruits (four in the 2015 ESPN 100) to carry the load as is often the case with a program that lands numerous one-and-done players. And when Amile Jefferson, their senior leader and top returning point scorer, went down in early December with a foot injury, their prospects looked bleak.

This is where the dichotomy occurs. For the past three months they've essentially played six guys a night and yet somehow have managed to secure 11 ACC wins and counting amid a gauntlet schedule, both in and out of conference.

But their maximization of limited resources won't get them a national title. They simply aren't deep enough.

From Rob Nelson of ESPN Stats & Info: Not a single team has won the national title in the past 20 seasons with less than seven guys averaging at least 10 minutes per game.

If Jefferson doesn't return, Chase Jeter will be Duke's seventh-most-active player at only 7.7 minutes per game, making them shallower than any team who has pulled off a title run in two decades. And while still talented, the 12-1 offering is nothing more than the respect Vegas is forced to give a blue-blood program who is sure to pull in public action regardless of its flaws.

Current odds: 10-1

As good as the Wildcats have been throughout conference play, a couple things stand out about them that curb my sentiment. First, they aren't shy about taking a 3-pointer. In fact, 44.2 percent of their field goal attempts come from 3-point range, the 20th-highest percentage out of the 351 D-I schools. The disturbing part? They only make 33 percent of those attempts at 260th best.

Combine this volume shooting of low-percentage shots with their pace of play at only 67.7 possessions per 40 minutes (253rd out of 351) and their ability to overcome a deficit in the second half becomes a question.

On only three occasions in conference play have the Wildcats found themselves down more than two points any time in the second half. Two of those games ended up in the loss column.

Sure, the fact that they've rarely been in that situation is a measure of how dominant they've been in the Big East. But at some point in their tournament run they will find themselves in a hole similar to the ones that got the better of them against Providence and at Xavier. The combination of their style of play and lack of experience dealing with adverse situations doesn't bode well for those outcomes.

What's more, I've never been too high on buying into historical comparisons of collegiate teams given the rapid turnover that occurs in such programs, but when one coach has struggled the way Jay Wright has at living up to expectations, it's worth noting.

Since he took over the program in 2001 the Wildcats have advanced past the Sweet 16 only twice, the most recent of which was back in 2009. Since then, Villanova has earned a No. 1 or No. 2 seed three times, failing to advance past the round of 32 on all three occasions. With the fourth shortest odds in the field at 10-1, I can't reasonably justify laying money on a team that hasn't made it to the second weekend in over half a decade, often when they were among the most likely to be expected to done so.",[]
espn.com,,What's behind Oklahoma City Thunder's fourth quarter collapses,"['Tim Macmahon', 'Anthony Olivieri', 'Chris Forsberg', 'Michael C', 'Royce Young', 'Kevin Arnovitz', 'Espn Com', 'Dave Mcmenamin', 'Zach Lowe', 'Baxter Holmes']","With a minute left, reality washed over the Oklahoma City Thunder. Center DeAndre Jordan had just finished a wild three-point play to put the Los Angeles Clippers up 99-97, and forward Kevin Durant followed with a missed jumper on the baseline. Shoulders slumped. Faces dropped.

Jamal Crawford hit a twisting runner to put the Clippers up four, and Durant split free throws on the other end. Finally a stop for the Thunder, and with 10 seconds left, they had a chance to save themselves from a humiliating giveaway. Instead, Russell Westbrook heaved an unexpected off-balanced 3 that hit only backboard, and the collapse was complete.

The Thunder entered the fourth quarter ahead by 17. They ended it down five -- 103-98. Over the final 7 minutes, 25 seconds of the game, the Thunder scored five points, with the Clippers putting up 26.

The Thunder left Staples Center that night at rock bottom, a defeated, dejected team that had their leader repeating the word ""discipline"" six times in the postmortem of the game. They boarded their flight for Oakland knowing the Warriors were waiting on them, and the 50 minutes in the air were spent in uncomfortable silence.

That loss was the Thunder's ninth when leading after three quarters, a number only superseded by the 76ers... who the Thunder then tied 24 hours later against the Warriors with a 10th loss when entering the fourth with a lead. That's [i]half[/i] of the Thunder's total losses this season. It's an alarming number, and one that had a spotlight shone at it starting with that Clippers game.

The Thunder entered the All-Star break at 40-14. Since then, they've dragged to a 3-6 record, with five of those losses featuring blown fourth-quarter leads. One was excusable, a one-point lead against the Warriors at Oracle Arena. The other three, though, featured sloppy turnovers, undisciplined defense, stagnant offense and other disconcerting issues that have the Thunder spinning. Against the Pacers, they led by seven with two-and-a-half minutes left. They allowed four 3-pointers to lose 101-98. Against the Warriors two weeks ago, they led by four with 14 seconds to go, but a turnover by Durant and then a foul by Durant forced overtime. And of course against the Clippers, they scored five points in eight minutes.

Even in their most recent win, a 104-96 bounce back in Milwaukee against the Bucks, the Thunder let a 21-point lead slip all the way down to two in the fourth quarter. They made the plays that time around to hold on -- and were aided by the fact the Bucks are the Bucks and made few themselves.

It's become a disturbing trend, and one that has the team asking a simple question: Why? With two of the most talented players in the league, who both have their fair share of clutch chops, what's going on? Why are the Thunder giving these games away?

""I think what happens is you fail to realize how hard you had to work to get an 18-point lead,"" coach Billy Donovan said. ""And then you think, 'OK well, it's just one possession here,' but before you know it, two 3s and a foul and that's eight points, and the whole thing changes.""

Turnovers are killing them

The main culprit, at least in terms of a tangible item: turnovers. The Thunder are a high-volume turnover team to start with (15.7 per game, 26th in the league), but in the fourth quarter alone, they turn the ball over four times on average with only the Nets worse than the Thunder. Since the All-Star break, the Thunder have been outscored by 22.2 points per 100 possessions -- worst in the league. The total score: 258-215.

""That's happened to us, to be honest with you, a lot since the All-Star break,"" Donovan said of letting games slip. ""But because you end up finding a way to win the game by six or eight close, you close out the game, you don't have a tendency to look at those things. But then you get into a Golden State or Clipper game, or even Indiana, where you're playing pretty well and you have a three-to-five minute stretch there that really just totally changes the momentum of the game.""

What's obvious is that the Thunder are doing good things in order to get those leads. It's just a matter of why it all evaporates -- and how to stop it from continuing to happen.

""The biggest thing for us is, can you sustain that for 48 minutes?"" Donovan said. ""But sometimes we have these lapses, these self-induced lapses. There's certain things where we're doing the right things, we're playing the right way, it's just they're playing better than we are right now and the momentum of the game has swung. The ones we have to eliminate is when we're generating the momentum changing in the favor of the other team.""

In past seasons, there's been internal aggravation with players stat hunting in games, especially in fourth quarters when the game appears to be in hand. That can contribute to the loss in focus and stunning lapses, but the team maintains that hasn't been an issue this season. Though, in Sunday's win against the Bucks, Durant was trying conspicuously hard to pass the ball when he was coincidentally only two assists shy of a triple-double. Durant had three fourth-quarter turnovers that game, all on forced passes into traffic.

Another example: Serge Ibaka inexplicably put up a 3 with 35 seconds remaining and the Thunder up eight, leaving the door open for the Bucks. Why? One reason: Durant was the one who had just passed him the ball.

""I have not seen that or sensed any of that,"" Donovan said of stat-padding. ""I've never, ever heard players ever mentioning anything about points, shots, touches, assists, rebounds. That's not to say they're not thinking about it, but I think they're probably smart enough not to say that in front of me.""

The Thunder have gone through a trying few weeks, both on and off the court. They've had a wave of adversity hit the organization, with another tragic event happening on Tuesday as Dion Waiters will be away from the team due to the death of his brother. In the losses they've had, they've looked fried mentally, especially as the game wears on. They look like a team afraid of the time and score, especially when they're winning. This is unusual for the Thunder.

The leadership of the team has failed to stabilize them in a way that the rest of the group desperately needs. That's always been the function of how they play -- it's Westbrook and Durant, and then everybody else. So when the battery doesn't come through, it's a bunch of other guys standing around shrugging and confused. What do I do now? Do I say something? Do I try to do something?

""If you look at some of our games, the point swings have been astronomical,"" Donovan said. ""We've got to recognize that; we've got to take some responsibility and accountability on ourselves to try to stop them.""

Donovan and Durant see it all as a potential positive, as an opportunity to do some discovery on the mettle of the team. Donovan has been preaching attention to detail and commitment the entire season. But as he pointed out, that message doesn't always get through when you're winning. Losing bears listening, and with 19 games to go before the losses really start mattering, the Thunder have to figure it out.",[]

Star Olympians like Gabby Douglas and Ryan Lochte and new Olympic hopefuls like golfer Lexi Thompson took questions from the media, held roundtable discussions and posed for photos and videos at the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California.

The U.S. swim team kicked things off, and questions turned to Michael Phelps, who was not on the panel. (Phelps will be speaking with the media on Tuesday.) Not surprisingly, Lochte had something to say about their in-pool rivalry and Phelps' return to the Olympics.

""We had one of the biggest rivalries in 2012. Now that he's back it's amazing. I know he's out there in Arizona working hard and it's pushing me. We bring out the best in each other. It's going to be fun to race him again in Rio."" Ryan Lochte

And what are the Team USA swimmers thinking midrace?

""Ow!""

""Help!""

""Lifeguard!""

Afterward, the swimmers had a chance to pose for some photos and mingle with the media and other Olympians. Simone Manuel, who is hoping for her first Olympic gold medal, met up with two-time gold medalist and fellow Stanford Cardinal Julie Foudy.

Later in the morning, USOC chief executive officer Scott Blackmun took several questions regarding the concerns over the Zika virus and what adjustments will be made to protect the athletes in and around Rio.

A more lighthearted moment occurred during the track and field session when athletes were asked what music gets them pumped up before their events. While many were varied, the panel generally agreed Drake is good at motivation songs, especially ""Headlines.""

Sims, 10, signed a minor league contract with the Yankees prior to the team's game with the Astros on Monday. (0:17)

TAMPA, Fla. -- Though Landis Sims was born without hands or half his legs, he signed a minor league contract with the New York Yankees on Monday.

Sims, 10, was called an inspiration by manager Joe Girardi after signing the deal. Upon completion of the contract, Sims took batting practice with a group that included Alex Rodriguez and Mark Teixeira prior to the Yankees' spring game against the Houston Astros.

Sims, represented by CC Sabathia in his negotiation with Yankees assistant general manager Jean Afterman, will receive a payment in honorarium.

Sims is a 4-foot-11, 105-pound second baseman from Elizabeth, Indiana, which is near Louisville, Kentucky. He has no legs from the knees down and wears prosthetics, which have Derek Jeter's No. 2 on the knees.

Without hands, he plays Little League with a soccer shinguard inserted into his baseball glove. This allows him to play defense. It works so well, he sometimes even pitches.

At bat, he uses the help of a prosthetic that allows him to cup the bat for his swing.

Sims offered inspiration for the Yankees on Monday. Girardi first met Sims two years ago.

Through a Yankees public relations representative, Sims was supposed to just watch batting practice on the field. After Girardi met him, the manager took Sims to meet his hero, Jeter.

Sims was in the Yankees' pre-workout meeting Monday morning, where the team watched part of a documentary being made by filmmaker Eric Cochran. It shows Sims' positive attitude.

""People can overcome extraordinary circumstances,"" said Girardi, who, along with communications director Jazon Zillo and Afterman, came up with the idea of the contract.

""It's amazing what the mind can do.""

Sims' mother, Amanda Haag, calls her son a blessing. His stepfather, Jeremy Haag, says he is an inspiration.

""He just draws people in,"" Amanda said.

""We're giving each other hitting lessons, trying to help each other out,"" Rodriguez said.

""That I'm living a freer, happier life is a huge change. I don't feel like I'm carrying weights around anymore,"" Phelps said.

Asked about his past transgressions, Phelps said he's a lot more laid back and open than he used to be. He said he has nothing to hide anymore, and although he's the same person in the mirror, how he approaches his life has changed considerably.

'Volleyball Olympics'

What about gold medal hopefuls on the beach April Ross and Kerri Walsh Jennings? The star duo was made available by video conference from Rio, where they are at qualifying events. Some have termed these Games the ""Volleyball Olympics.""

They're ready, even though Walsh Jennings is coming back from a shoulder injury.

""My shoulder feels great. Ever since [the injury], I've been on a mission to get my body ready. April and I have left no stone unturned getting ready -- body, mind and soul. We feel ready,"" Walsh Jennings said. ""You can just tell [volleyball] is going to be big, really big here at this Olympics.""

Concerns about the Zika virus in South America was a common theme on Tuesday.

Walsh-Jennings was pregnant during the London Games. Strong evidence has emerged indicating a link between Zika and the birth defect microcephaly, which causes children to be born with abnormally small heads and underdeveloped brains.

""To be perfectly honest, the media is making it way bigger than it is; that's my perception of it,"" she said. ""It's not like you're going to Rio and flipping a coin and it's as dramatic as it is being presented. With that being said, when babies are being involved, you shouldn't take any chances, and make sure you're in the clear before. That would be my advice.""

Pollution in Rio is also on a lot of athletes' minds for both how it affects their own health and for the environment in Rio, in general. Sailor Annie Haeger said her New Year's resolution was to not use plastic bags anymore, given the ongoing issue of trash in the water -- in Rio and beyond.

Paralympics was a big part of the London Olympics and should get an even higher profile in Rio, with 66 hours of scheduled television coverage -- the most ever.

One of the standout guests was archer Matt Stutzman. Stutzman has no arms, yet he set a Guinness World Record last year for long-distance archery by hitting a target over 300 yards away.

He said he lives on a 50-acre farm and he and his buddy were shooting targets -- Stutzman with a bow and arrow, his friend with a rifle. They kept moving targets back, eventually surpassing 300 yards. Stutzman then contacted Guinness, which gave him three attempts to hit the target. He nailed it on his second shot.

espn.com,,Former Princeton pitchers Chris Young and Ross Ohlendorf give Royals an Ivy League pedigree,"['David Schoenfield', 'Scott Lauber', 'Andrew Marchand', 'Doug Padilla', 'Eddie Matz', 'Jerry Crasnick', 'Jesse Rogers']","SURPRISE, Ariz. -- After a long, hot day at the diamond, some spring training roommates retreat to their apartments and unwind by watching college hoops or the latest Netflix fare. Kansas City Royals pitchers Chris Young and Ross Ohlendorf, who are sharing a place in the Phoenix suburb of Goodyear this spring, are partial to ""Shark Tank,'' the reality show that gives budding entrepreneurs an opportunity to pitch ideas to business moguls in exchange for investment seed money.

""That's our go-to show,'' Ohlendorf says. ""It's cool seeing new products. And I like the business strategy, from both a company and investor standpoint.''

Throw two Princeton alumni with inquisitive minds and some free time together in the Cactus League, and the leisure viewing material is bound to be thought-provoking. No ""Toddlers and Tiaras'' for these guys.

The eclectic mix on Kansas City's roster this spring reflects general manager Dayton Moore's willingness to explore every avenue for players who can contribute to the cause. Kris Medlen, Peter Moylan and Mike Minor, former Atlanta Braves whose careers have been sidetracked by injuries, all landed in Kansas City, in part because Moore and manager Ned Yost are so diligent about keeping tabs on their former organization.

In the same corner of the clubhouse, the Royals have brought together Young and Ohlendorf, Ivy Leaguers who bring competitiveness and experience to the mound while doing wonders for the collective clubhouse IQ.

Young, 36, re-signed with Kansas City on a two-year, $11.75 million contract in December and is ticketed for a job as a swing man or the team's fifth starter. Ohlendorf, 33, signed a minor-league deal with the Royals in February and is competing for a spot in the bullpen with Dillon Gee, Brian Flynn, Brian Duensing, John Lannan, Chien-Ming Wang, Peter Moylan and David Huff.

The two pitchers played at Princeton for coach Scott Bradley, a former big-league catcher who is entering his 19th season on the New Jersey campus. Cleveland Indians general manager Mike Chernoff and outfielder Will Venable and Colorado Rockies pitcher David Hale are fellow Princeton alumni who are on the scene in the Cactus League this spring.

Understandably, some of Young and Ohlendorf's teammates are bowled over by the sight of all that brainpower crammed into adjoining locker stalls. Princeton has produced the likes of President Woodrow Wilson, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos and Supreme Court justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Samuel Alito. With Young and Ohlendorf in the fold, the Royals have exceeded their Ivy League allotment.

""We have a good mix of book smarts and street smarts here,'' says Moylan, a native of Australia. ""I grew up in the school of hard knocks, and they grew up in a school with, well, lots of school and teaching.''

Joked pitcher Kris Medlen: ""We get into some pretty deep conversations. Neil deGrasse Tyson was in here the other day talking about quantum physics.''

Love those SAT scores

Young, a Dallas native, scored ''1300-something'' on his SATs in the days when 1600 was the standard. As a two-sport athlete playing baseball and basketball, he chose Princeton over Vanderbilt, Texas, Oklahoma, Boston College and fellow Ivies Yale and Pennsylvania.

Young played both sports for Princeton until Pittsburgh selected him in the third round of the 2000 Major League Baseball first-year player draft, and he continued to work toward a political science degree while spending summers as a pitcher in the Pirates' chain. Young wrote his senior thesis on how the media helped shape public opinion during Jackie Robinson's quest to integrate Major League Baseball with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.

As a high schooler in Texas, Ross Ohlendorf scored a 1520 out of a possible 1600 on his SATs. TNS via Getty Images

Ohlendorf, a product of Austin, Texas, logged a 1520 out of a possible 1600 on his SATs. When he visited Princeton on his recruiting trip in 2001, Young -- by then an upperclassman -- showed him around the campus and opened his eyes to the possibilities that awaited him as an elite student-athlete.

After the Arizona Diamondbacks selected him in the fourth round of the 2004 draft, Ohlendorf returned to Princeton and obtained his degree in Operations Research and Financial Engineering. He wrote his senior thesis on the MLB first-year player draft and its financial impact on the game from 1989-1993. The paper ran about 140 pages -- ""if you include the graphs,"" he says.

In tandem, the two pitchers have made 368 big-league appearances and belied the stereotype that Ivy League ballplayers fall more on the gentlemanly than the ""grinder'' end of the scale.

Consider the obstacles Young has surmounted to last this long. He survived an Albert Pujols line drive to the face in 2008 and came back from thoracic outlet surgery to go 12-9 with a 3.65 ERA for the Seattle Mariners and win the 2014 American League Comeback Player of the Year award. Last year, Young signed with Kansas City as a relative afterthought in March and wound up playing a pivotal role in the Royals' World Series run.

An afterthought when he joined the Royals prior to the 2015 season, Chris Young played in integral role in Kansas City's postseason run last fall when he compiled a 2.87 ERA in four appearances and got the win in Game 1 of the World Series. Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images

Young was downright inspirational in October, pitching with poise and resolve after his father, Charles, died of cancer in late September. During the American League Division Series, he struck out seven Houston Astros in four innings with a fastball that topped out at 89 mph.

In hindsight, Young credits his college experience with steeling him for many of the challenges that MLB has thrown his way.

""Princeton is so ultra-competitive, you have to be that way to go to a place like that,'' Young says. ""It's one of reasons I ended up there. There was an opportunity to be around some of the brightest people in the country and ask yourself, 'Can I hang with them?'

""If you're not willing to put in the work, the time and commitment to being successful, you might not make it. I saw a lot of kids with bright minds who went there and had to take a year off for academic reasons or because they couldn't handle the social aspect. In a lot of ways, it prepared me for what you go through in this lifestyle.''

Future general managers?

Young won points with statistically oriented social media followers during the 2015 American League Championship Series, when he scoffed at the notion that he might be disappointed over pitching 4 2/3 innings against Toronto and falling short of a victory. During a media interview, Young called the win a ""somewhat ridiculous stat.''

Nevertheless, baseball number-crunchers who expect Young and Ohlendorf to champion the virtues of SIERA and xFIP are bound to be disappointed. Not long ago, Young asked Ohlendorf which statistic he considers the best measure of a pitcher's performance. He received a surprisingly old-fashioned response.

""I feel like ERA is the most important,'' Ohlendorf says. ""You want to be able to measure quality and quantity, so innings and ERA are two ways to do that. Whenever you look at stats, there's a question of whether you're trying to measure how well someone did or project how well they're going to do. If you're trying to project how well they're gonna do, you might want to use something else.''

While Young places stock in numbers, he uses them to complement rather than shape his baseball world view. He has monitored the trend toward academic thinkers in front offices and is intrigued by the prospect of entering that realm when his playing career is finished.

""I appreciate the analytics and use that in my preparation,'' Young says. ""But I don't overanalyze analytics. For me, it's more the basic trends than huge breakdowns. If Jose Abreu hits 'X' on sliders and 'Y' on fastballs, I'm playing the statistics a little bit knowing, 'In this situation, the slider might be the better pitch.' There's a place for that, and I'd like to learn more about that potentially in a front office role.''

Ohlendorf, similarly, is intrigued by the prospect of working for a team, but he has some business ventures that promise to keep him busy if he chooses. He and his father, Curtis, run a company called Rocking O Longhorns out of Lockhart, Texas, that calls itself ""the home of pretty and productive cattle.'' He indulges his entrepreneurial bent by raising and selling bulls, steers and heifers when he's not throwing fastballs.

""Ross is an anomaly in a lot of ways,'' Young says. ""He's one of the brightest people I know, and one of the simplest. Sometimes, the smarter and more analytical a person is, the more complex things are. He has an unbelievable way of simplifying things. It's an art.''

In Ohlendorf's estimation, Young's most admirable quality is his ability to relate to people and stay grounded no matter how much success he enjoys.

""Chris says hi to everybody who works for the team and calls them by name,'' Ohlendorf says. ""He's very friendly and engaging and wants to include everybody. And he has very strong morals. He quickly earns everyone's respect.''

In their corner of the Kansas City clubhouse, the two Princeton buddies have shown that intelligence needn't be daunting, and it's possible for big brains and big hearts to co-exist. That's a nice recipe for survival in the major-league shark tank.",[]
espn.com,,World Cup of Hockey roster surprises,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Scott Burnside', 'Paul Grant']","Scott Burnside, Pierre LeBrun and Craig Custance break down some of the roster moves announced for The World Cup of Hockey, including Phil Kessel not being named to Team USA. (5:57)

TORONTO -- By the end of the day Wednesday, 128 players had been named to participate in the World Cup of Hockey to be held Sept. 17 to Oct. 1 in Toronto. Here's a look at the five biggest stories and surprises from this big day.

Doug Armstrong and Tom Renney believe in their choices for Team Canada. Graig Abel/NHLI/Getty Images

1. Phil Kessel of the Pittsburgh Penguins might have been a lock on most projected rosters, dating back to the announcement of the World Cup of Hockey last fall, given his status as one of the best pure goal scorers in the NHL. But his star has fallen, and Team USA is looking to build a heavier, more physical squad for next fall's tournament, so he wasn't included in the first 16. Kessel can still salvage a place on this roster when the final seven spots are named June 1, but the clock is ticking on the two-time Olympian.

2. Carey Price of the Montreal Canadiens is the world's best goaltender. He swept the individual honors at last year's NHL awards, but he has suffered through an injury-plagued season that has seen him suit up for just 12 games. He might not play again this season, but he was named to Canada's roster anyway. That's respect. Also, Canada can replace him if he's not healthy enough to play. But the sub-story to Price's addition is that Canada named three goaltenders Wednesday, which tells the Washington Capitals' Braden Holtby and the Chicago Blackhawks' Corey Crawford that management has full trust in their abilities if Price can't answer the bell.

Editor's Picks Burnside: It's hard to believe Phil Kessel is not on the roster Greater depth at forward and a substandard season have squeezed out Phil Kessel, a player who had been a go-to scorer for Team USA in the past.

LeBrun: P.K. Subban, Corey Perry among Canada snubs Even with their goaltending hierarchy established, Canada has some difficult decisions to make in naming its final roster.

Custance: Beware speedy Team North America at World Cup Team North America will go into the World Cup of Hockey with speed to burn and a surprising physical presence up front, which means the world hockey powers better not overlook it. 2 Related

3. You think it's easy to pick these teams? How about Team North America GM Peter Chiarelli leaving one of his top young players with the Edmonton Oilers, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, off the first 16? Canadian GM Doug Armstrong left defensemen Jay Bouwmeester and Alex Pietrangelo, both of whom won a gold medal with Canada in Sochi in 2014, off Canada's first 16. Bob Murray, GM of the Anaheim Ducks and a member of the Canadian management team, left off star scorer Corey Perry. That's being objective.

4. Both Team North America and Team Europe feature players from different countries trying to forge an identity and bond in a short period of time to compete with players who have played together in best-on-best tournaments, in some cases, for years. Miroslav Satan, a former NHLer and current GM of Team Europe, believes the desire to win and inherent competitiveness of NHL players will make the process easier. Without question, Anze Kopitar, Zdeno Chara and Marian Hossa will make sure the guys on Team Europe have their eyes on the prize.

5. Is there anyone in the hockey world not pulling for Jaromir Jagr to continue to defy the hands of time and play for his native Czech Republic next fall? Unlikely. Even so, Jagr, 44, was not named to the first 16 of the Czechs because he told GM Martin Rucinsky, with whom he won an Olympic gold medal in 1998, that he wants to concentrate on his Florida Panthers' run to the playoffs. Let's not forget that he said after last year's World Championships that he was done with international hockey. But Rucinsky wants him to suit up in Toronto, and the rest of the hockey world is hoping for the same.",[]

espn.com,,Calvin Johnson of Detroit Lions retiring from NFL after nine seasons,"['Sheil Kapadia', 'Vaughn Mcclure', 'Tory Barron', 'Mike Reiss', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Adam Teicher', 'Eric Williams', 'Jeff Legwold', 'Jim Trotter', 'Kevin Seifert']","ALLEN PARK, Mich. -- Calvin Johnson is hanging them up, the Detroit Lions announced Tuesday.

The most prolific wide receiver in franchise history and one of the most talented at the position in NFL history is retiring after nine professional seasons in which he accumulated over 11,000 receiving yards, seven 1,000-yard seasons and six Pro Bowl invitations.

Editor's Picks These star athletes took early retirement By retiring after just nine seasons, Detroit star WR Calvin Johnson joins this list of illustrious athletes, including the Lions' Barry Sanders, who left fans wanting more.

From the record to the 'Calvin Johnson Rule,' a career with impactful moments In a career littered with spectacular individual moments, here are five that stand out for retiring Detroit Lions receiver Calvin Johnson:

Like Barry Sanders and Jim Brown, Calvin Johnson walks away on his own terms As the face of the franchise, Calvin Johnson was the connection who kept the often-listless Lions relevant to the rest of the nation. 2 Related

Johnson holds nearly every significant franchise record; the man nicknamed ""Megatron"" holds 15 NFL records, including the most receiving yards in a season with 1,964 in 2012.

In a statement released by the Lions, Johnson said he would not be having a news conference to discuss his decision.

""Let me begin by apologizing for making this announcement via a statement and not in person. While I truly respect the significance of this, those who know me best will understand and not be surprised that I choose not to have a press conference for this announcement.

""After much prayer, thought and discussion with loved ones, I have made the difficult decision to retire from the Lions and pro football. I have played my last game of football.

""Let me assure you that this was not an easy or hasty decision. As I stated, I, along with those closest to me, have put a lot of time, deliberation and prayer into this decision and I truly am at peace with it.

""I also want you to know that I have the utmost respect and admiration for the game of football. It has provided so much for me and my family and I will be forever grateful to the game.

""With the reality of my decision, I realize there are a lot of people I would like to thank. I must start with my family -- thank you for all your love and support.

""I also want you to know that I have the utmost respect and admiration for the game of football. It has provided so much for me and my family and I will be forever grateful to the game."" Calvin Johnson

""I also want to especially thank Mrs. Ford and the Ford Family for all their support over the years. They are tremendous owners and I loved playing for them. I would also like to recognize Mr. Ford, who I was honored to know and play for before he passed away.

""While it would be hard to name them all, I would also like to thank all of my teammates past and present.

""I also want to thank all of my coaches who I played for, in particular Coach Caldwell for his support, wisdom and guidance over the past two seasons. I loved playing for Coach Caldwell.

""There are so many other people I would like to recognize and thank for what they have done for me throughout my career, but rather than risk forgetting someone, I will simply say ""thanks"" to everyone.

""And finally, to the fans of Detroit and Michigan. I so appreciated your passionate support over the years and truly enjoyed playing for you. I loved playing in Detroit and will forever be a Lion. My biggest regret is that I wasn't able to help give our fans a championship. But I do believe the future of the Lions is bright and with the leadership from people like Rod Wood and Bob Quinn, who I have gotten to know over the past few months, I am confident that our fans will soon be rewarded with the championship you deserve.

""From the bottom of my heart I thank you all for everything.""

The Lions announced Tuesday that Johnson filed his retirement papers with the NFL in advance of the start of the new league year on Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET.

Many, including the Lions and Hall of Fame wide receiver Jerry Rice, tweeted in response to Johnson's announcement Tuesday afternoon:

I got mad respect for you Megatron! And outstanding football player and greater person! #GoodLuckRetirement  Jerry Rice (@JerryRice) March 8, 2016

Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford said in a statement Tuesday that Johnson will be missed by fans and teammates alike.

""It was such an honor to play the game with one of the best of all time. I will cherish the lessons I've learned from him and the friendship we have forged over the past seven years,"" Stafford said. ""He is truly one-of-a-kind in his humility and grace both on and off the field. We have all learned from Calvin with how he treated his family, his work and his friends.""

The 30-year-old announced on Jan. 6 that he was evaluating his options for the future, and now he's finalized that decision. While Johnson -- 6-foot-5, 237 pounds with a 4.35-second 40-yard dash at the 2007 NFL combine -- has been dynamic, his body has been beaten up. He has dealt with knee, ankle and finger injuries over the past four seasons. He played through an ankle injury the last eight weeks of the 2015 season.

Injuries aside, the Lions had seven losing seasons in his nine years with the Lions, though Johnson had maintained the highest level of play.

He had said consistently over the past few months he wanted to play his entire career in Detroit and wanted to win with the Lions.

""Very few people have achieved the kind of excellence that he has in terms of his playing career,"" Lions coach Jim Caldwell said last season. ""I mean, he's been incredible, and the numbers keep stacking up, and it's because of the fact that he's one of those guys that makes plays week-in and week-out, year-in and year-out, and it's consistent.

""A lot of guys that you've seen, if you take a look, they've had a great game and maybe never have a great game again or they've had a great eight-game stretch or they've maybe had a great year. But very few people can stack them on top of one another year after year after year after year. He's one of those guys.

""His approach to the game, I think, is outstanding. His performances have been absolutely incredible, and he practices the same way.""

Johnson won't be anymore, though.

He was due to make $24 million against the cap in 2016. The Lions will save at least $11.1 million in cap space with Johnson's retirement, and as of now, the franchise is still on the hook for $12.9 million in dead money for 2016.

The Lions also announced Tuesday with respect to Johnson's contract that those ""matters were settled to the satisfaction of the parties.""

Johnson, the No. 2 overall pick of the Lions in 2007, was selected just after the Oakland Raiders took JaMarcus Russell. Johnson proved to be the smarter pick.

His records with the Lions include most career receptions (731), career receiving yards (11,619), receiving yards in a season (1,964), receiving yards in a game (329), career receiving touchdowns (83) and receiving touchdowns in a season (16).

Among the NFL's elite, he is No. 43 all time in receptions, No. 27 in yards and No. 22 in touchdowns. According to Pro Football Reference, Johnson's 86.1 yards per game receiving average is second all time behind Julio Jones, who is averaging 95.4 yards per game over the past five seasons.

Johnson only made two playoff appearances, though -- in 2011 and 2014. Detroit lost both games.

His career and subsequent retirement are reminiscent of another Lions icon, Barry Sanders.

Sanders, considered one of the best running backs in NFL history and the most popular Lions player in history, retired on the eve of training camp in 1999 at age 31 after 10 seasons. Now, Johnson is leaving the game after nine years at age 30.

In a blog post Tuesday, Sanders wrote that Johnson ""was an amazing and rare talent both on and off the field, and I feel lucky to have been able to see him play.""

Sanders and Johnson are simultaneously the most recognizable Lions in franchise history and two of Detroit's most beloved players. But they transcended the city and made the Lions, who have never reached the Super Bowl, relevant on the national stage.",[]

Curry has also averaged 46.5 points per game against the New Orleans Pelicans.

The informal college race will boast a field that likely contains at least one 2016 Olympian.

This weekends Tritonman Triathlon hosted by the University of California San Diego Triathlon Team is not just your average college race. It addition to becoming popular among collegiate athletes living near the west coast, it also attracts a competitive field of elite ITU athletes. The lineup at Saturdays draft-legal raceheld in Mission Bay, the location of the first triathlon in 1974boasts a start line that could very well include multiple athletes who will make it to the Olympics in Rio this August.

Saturdays race will feature a mix of elites and collegiate athletes looking to improve pack skills for the draft-legal event at Nationals or a future in ITU racing, capped at 75 athletes per gender. The race also serves as a U-25 Elite Development Race, which means the first three amateur U.S. athletes will become eligible for an elite license if they finish within five percent of the winners time. Sundays race is open to collegiate and age group athletes with a half-Olympic distance race (fun fact: 1982 Ironman World Champion Kathleen McCartney will be racing).

The four men at the top of USATs Objective Ranking System for Olympic Qualification will be going head to head, including Greg Billington, returning Tritonman winner Joe Maloy, Eric Lagerstrom and 2014 winner Ben Kanute. (Note: The U.S. mens team has not yet been decided, and if no one qualifies at the ITU World Triathlon Yokohama in May, it will come down to these rankings.)

The race provides a way for the high-level athletes to do a race simulation in an informal yet competitive environment that doesnt require extensive globetrotting.

This more casual hit out is great since I race so many times around the world every year and everything is so high pressure, so its fun to reconnect with why I picked up triathlon in the first placefor the fun and the community, Lagerstrom says.

Billington agrees, saying that the friendly and spirited race is ideal because he can put in a full effort without the risk of a bad result. I can go all out, maybe blow up, maybe mess up my tactics a bit and I wont have wasted thousands of dollars or screwed up my ITU ranking, he says.

RELATED  PROfile: Joe Maloy

Maloy made a college analogy when describing the event: If competing on the World Triathlon Series is attending a banquet-style party, then racing Tritonman is skipping class and playing beer pong on the lawn, he says. Its a relaxed atmosphere thats focused on fun, camaraderie and banter between the competitors.

The female field includes 2015 winner Summer Cook, 2012 Olympic bronze medalist Erin Densham, Lindsey Jerdonek, Kirsten Kasper, Taylor Spivey, Renee Tomlin and more women who have been climbing up the ITU professional ranks.

For Cook, who was brought up through the Collegiate Recruitment Program and is now coached by Paulo Sousa, last years win provided some affirmation. Winning against some of the biggest names in the sport was to me a sign that Im headed in the right direction, she says. I knew that I still had a lot of work to do to replicate that result in a high level ITU race ... but despite this, last years race was still a huge confidence boost because I realized that such results can be attainable in the future if I keep focusing on making small progressions on a race-to-race basis.

Another reason the elites enjoy racing Tritonman is because their involvement helps to raise money that will offset the triathlon teams funds. Every dollar that goes towards race feeds goes directly back to the team, and the event is completely run by student volunteers. Find out more about Tritonman here.

(2:01)

CHICAGO -- Bulls All-Star swingman Jimmy Butler will travel to Alabama to meet with Dr. James Andrews on Thursday morning to get a second opinion on his injured left knee. Butler has been ruled out of Thursday's game against the San Antonio Spurs.

""Jimmy, he felt pretty good this morning,"" coach Fred Hoiberg said after practice on Wednesday. ""Came in [Tuesday] night, got a workout, participated this morning. He's going to go down and see Dr. Andrews down in Alabama today just to get a second opinion on the knee. [Thursday] he won't play, but we'll hopefully get some news tomorrow and then confer with everybody and put a plan together. ... I think everybody agrees that it's a good idea to go down there and get an opinion from one of the top doctors in the world.""

Butler came back to the lineup in Saturday's win over the Houston Rockets after missing a month because of a left knee strain suffered in a Feb. 5 loss to the Denver Nuggets. Hoiberg was very pleased with the way Butler looked in Sunday's practice, but the knee started swelling after that and he was held out of Monday's win over the Milwaukee Bucks.

Hoiberg noted that Butler has already had two MRIs on the injured knee in the past month, with another one likely coming during Butler's appointment with Andrews on Thursday.

""The swelling has gone down,"" Hoiberg said. ""The swelling's pretty much gone now. He's got a little bit of pain on the back of that knee. We just want to be safe with it.""

Butler played 34 minutes in the win over the Rockets before fouling out, including 21 of a possible 24 in the first half.

For the second day in a row, Hoiberg defended his decision to give the 26-year-old so many minutes in his first game back.

""Jimmy had two really good weeks of going 100 percent on that leg,"" Hoiberg said. ""Had a really good practice the day before, got him out in the game situation, felt great during the game. We monitored him throughout that game on how he was feeling. [He] felt good the next morning, participated in practice and then it swelled up a little bit on him.

""So as far as the plan the first time around -- going hard for two weeks -- that was put into place and now obviously with a little bit of a setback, we'll send him down there and confer with everybody. With [team physician] Dr. [Brian] Cole, with Dr. Andrews, who I know are very close and see where things are.""

Hoiberg acknowledged that part of the reason the appointment with Andrews was set up was for Butler's own peace of mind. He also said that it was Butler's decision to meet with the world-renowned doctor and that the Bulls' staff agreed with it.

The All-Star leads the league in minutes played alongside Rockets guard James Harden, averaging 37.8 minutes.

Hoiberg said that Bobby Portis went to an eye doctor on Wednesday to check on the rookie's swollen left eye. Hoiberg is hopeful Portis will play against the Spurs.

Durand is the fastest Paralympic athlete in the world; however, the possibility of challenging able-bodied competitors is not a matter of her ability to run, but of being able to modify the logistics of her discipline.

Durand is almost entirely blind, and the 24-year-old relies on a guide who runs beside her with a tether to make sure she stays in her lane. In order for her to compete in the Olympics, she would need such a guide or device to help prevent her from drifting.

""My place in the 4x100 relay at the Olympics is not assured yet, but it would be a privilege, an honor and a great achievement for a Paralympic athlete to compete in conventional competitions,"" she said in an interview for German Deutsche Welle news agency.

Even after her sight worsened due to the birth of her daughter (vision changes are a common result of childbirth), Durand clocked 11.65 seconds in the 100 meter T12 heats of the Parapan American Games, held in Toronto last year. Durand broke the previous record, set in London 2012 by Guohua Zhou from China, by .26 seconds.

Omara won gold medals in the 100 and 400 meter races and repeated the achievement, adding the 200 meter category, in the Athletics World Championships in Qatar two months after Toronto.

""I had great results in the three events I participated in, it's a challenge, but my goal is to reach Rio in good condition,"" she said.

If Durand's wish is granted, she would be the first Paralympic female athlete to participate in the Olympics, but not the first overall.

Four years ago, double-amputee runner Oscar Pistorius defied the International Olympic Committee in search for another obstacle to overcome in his long career in athletics. In London 2012 and after a long legal process, he became the first Paralympic athlete to compete in the Olympics.

Unlike the South African, Durand's case is more complicated.

espn.com,,"Lucas Matthysse bows out of fight in May, still dealing with injured eye","['Dan Rafael', 'Pa Sport', 'Nick Parkinson', 'Brian Campbell', 'Nigel Collins']","Argentine slugger Lucas Matthysse, whose injured left eye is still giving him problems, has bowed out his planned return fight, Golden Boy Promotions vice president Eric Gomez told ESPN.com on Wednesday.

Matthysse was scheduled to return on May 7 to fight in the HBO PPV co-feature of the Canelo Alvarez-Amir Khan middleweight championship bout at the new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. A deal was in the works for a welterweight fight with Mauricio Herrera (22-5, 7 KOs), who was also going to move up in weight.

But Matthysse is not physically ready to return, said Gomez, who has been meeting with Mario Arano, Matthysse's co-promoter from Argentina, this week in Los Angeles.

""He was training and getting ready for the fight, but he felt some discomfort in his eye and he wants more rest,"" Gomez said of the longtime junior welterweight contender and one of the best pure punchers in boxing.

In his last fight, on Oct. 3 at the StubHub Center in Carson, California, Matthysse challenged Viktor Postol for a vacant junior welterweight world title. In an upset, Postol knocked out Matthysse (37-4, 34 KOs) in the 10th round with a shot to the left eye that fractured his orbital bone.

Matthysse went into that fight coming off one of his biggest victories, a majority decision win against former junior welterweight titlist Ruslan Provodnikov in April -- a top fight of the year contender.

Gomez tamped down rumors that the 33-year-old Matthysse is retiring.

""He's not going to fight on May 7. He is going to rest more but he is not retiring,"" Gomez said. ""Mario talked to him about it. What Lucas is going to do is rest, take some more time for his eye to heal and see how it is. In a few months we'll see how he's doing and go from there.""

Gomez said he and Golden Boy CEO Oscar De La Hoya will begin looking at other possible fights for the Alvarez-Khan co-feature.",[]

WASHINGTON -- When welterweights Sadam Ali and Jessie Vargas were matched for a vacant world title most viewed it as a toss-up fight with neither man holding any significant advantage. But when it was over it wasn't close.

Vargas won decisively, knocking Ali down twice and knocking him out in the ninth round to win a vacant welterweight world title Saturday night in the co-feature of the Luis Ortiz-Tony Thompson heavyweight fight at the DC Armory.

""I tore him apart piece by piece,"" said Vargas, who won his second world title after a stint with a junior welterweight belt. ""I was patient. I looked for openings and when I had the openings I fired the shots. This is what I have been working for all my life since I was 8 years old. Now I'm a two-time world champion.""

Vargas credited new trainer Dewey Cooper -- his sixth trainer in eight years as a pro -- for the game plan and conditioning.

""Adding Dewey Cooper to the team was huge,"" Vargas said. ""He brought out the power, without a doubt. He got the best out of Jessie Vargas tonight. Jessie Vargas is here to stay.""

It was the kind of explosive victory that will put Vargas into the conversation for a much bigger fight.

""I will put him with any welterweight in the world. Maybe the winner of the [April 9 Manny] Pacquiao-[Timothy] Bradley fight,"" Top Rank promoter Bob Arum said.

Vargas came into the fight still steamed by how his last fight in June ended. That was when he challenged Bradley for a world title and nearly knocked him out in the final seconds of the bout. However, Vargas, who lost a clear unanimous decision, felt as though he was robbed of the chance to finish Bradley because referee Pat Russell mistook the clapper signaling 10 seconds left in the round as the final bell and stopped the fight with about seven seconds left. Now he wants a rematch.

""I want Bradley, win or lose [against Pacquiao],"" Vargas said. ""We have unfinished business.""

Ali and Vargas both came out quickly looking to earn the respect of the other man, and both landed some heavy shots in the early rounds as they went back and forth. Ali looked a little quicker but Vargas' left hook was sharp.

The fourth round featured good back-and-forth action with Vargas in control early and Ali pouring it on late as they each landed heavy shots, although Ali's right eye began to swell in the round.

Ali fell into the ropes in the fifth round but not from a clean punch. He was off balance, but Vargas finished the round with a combination to Ali's head that seemed to buzz him.

Ali (22-1, 13 KOs), a 27-year-old 2008 U.S. Olympian from Brooklyn, New York, had been having a very good eighth round when just as the clapper signaling that there were 10 seconds left sounded Vargas nailed him with a clean overhand right that crumpled Ali along the ropes. He got to his feet just as the round ended.

""I take nothing away from Vargas,"" Ali said. ""He caught me with a good shot. When I got up my right ankle was messed up. No excuses. He landed some good shots, some shots I didn't see. I was a little off. No excuses. He looked good. I have to go back to the drawing board.""

Vargas (27-1, 10 KOs), 26, a former junior welterweight titlist from Las Vegas, was all over him in the ninth round. Ali looked unsteady and Vargas pounded him to the head and body. A right hand hurt Ali badly, and moments later Vargas landed another right hand that dropped him midway through the round. He beat the count and was very shaky.

Vargas went right to him and clubbed him with a right hand that rocked him again, and referee Kenny Chevalier jumped in and waved it off at 2 minutes, 9 seconds, disappointing the pro-Ali crowd, many of whom made their way from New York for the fight.

""We finally saw [the talent] tonight,"" Arum said. ""We said to him you got to let your hands go and he had really good training. We always knew he had punching power, but he would never really let the hands go. Tonight he was great.""

Escandon knocks out Castellanos for interim title

Oscar Escandon, whose wife gave birth to a daughter three weeks ago while he was entrenched in training camp, will be able to go home with something awfully shiny when he meets his little girl.

Escandon (25-2, 17 KOs), moving up in weight, knocked out Robinson Castellanos (21-11, 13 KOs) with one second left in the seventh round to win a vacant interim featherweight world title to punctuate a dominant performance.

""I feel very happy about this victory. It's been a long time coming and I'm very proud to take the title back to my country,"" Escandon said. ""Robinson is a very tough guy he came to fight, but my training camp showed in this event. I've been trying very hard sacrificing a lot to be at this stage if my career, including spending time with my family.""

Castellanos scored a knockdown in the second round when he tagged Escandon with a jab followed by a right hand that sent him to his rear end, although Escandon got up quickly and did not appear hurt. Escandon then took control of the fight.

""When I was dropped it was just a sting. I didn't get hurt and I realize that I needed to fight with more intelligence to make sure I secured this victory,"" Escandon said.

Escandon, 31, a 2004 Colombian Olympian, worked over the taller Castellanos to the body throughout the fight and broke him down. He had Castellanos in trouble early in the fifth round as he backed him into a corner and banged away at him. Castellanos suffered a bad cut over his left eye in the round and referee Frank Garza called timeout for the ringside doctor to examine the wound.

Castellanos (23-11, 13 KOs), 33, of Mexico, was clearly weakening and Escandon kept the pressure on him. In the seventh round, he hurt him with a right hand while he was trapped in a corner and then dropped him with a clean right uppercut. Castellanos went down to a knee and Garza counted him out.

""I'm very disappointed but I gave it my all,"" Castellanos said. ""I felt like I fought with a lot of heart and that's really all you can do. Unfortunately, the outcome wasn't what I personally wanted, but I respect Oscar. He's a good fighter. He was very fast and caught me with some good shots. He has a big heart and I wish him the best.""

Escandon, trained by Ruben Guerrero (father of former world titleholder Robert Guerrero) is next mandated to face the winner of the April 16 fight between full titleholder Gary Russell Jr. (26-1, 15 KOs) and Patrick Hyland (31-1, 15 KOs).

The loss ends Castellanos' run of back-to-back upset wins in which he knocked out then-undefeated Ronny Rios in the fifth round in October 2014, and followed with a lopsided decision victory against Rocky Juarez in January 2015 to earn the mandatory shot against Russell, who was sidelined because of a cut that forced him out of a voluntary defense against Escandon in November.",[]

Someone had to step in and fill the ""Void."" And that someone is  - Joo Sung Wook, aka Zest, aka the best Protoss player in the world.

While there was definitely a period during Heart of the Swarm when Zest was the top Protoss, that time was relatively short, and he was surely passed up by Rain and herO. Here's a look at Zest's televised matches so far in 2016:

So what is Zest doing that other Protosses are not?

Protoss vs Protoss:

Zest is favoring mobility above all else. So far in his PvP games, he's been utilizing Blink Stalkers and Warp Prisms non-stop, all game. He will often times have a weaker army, one that would never win in a headsup fight. He makes up for this by not having that headsup fight until he has chipped away at you sufficiently.

How does he do it? Through excellent multi-tasking. Zest is consistently on his opponent's side of the map, either poking, or preparing to poke, in somewhere. Any time that you see a Warp Prism move in, know that Zest is also about to hit you somewhere else with his Blink Stalkers. While other players are trying to make an ultimate army, Zest kills them with a thousand paper-cuts. By the time the game comes to a head, Zest has done so much damage and kept you so busy, that it doesn't matter what units he has, his extra economy will tear you apart.

Protoss vs Zerg:

Versus Zerg, we see Zest punish the immobile Siege-based armies that are popular in the current Zerg vs Protoss metagame. Most Protoss have a huge problem dealing with the powerful but slow moving Lurker based armies that top Zergs are fielding against them. To punish these armies, Zest is using 3 specific tactics: Harassment, Flanking, and ""pre-teching.""

For Harassment, Zest's main tool is once again the Warp Prism. When the main Zerg army moves against Zest, his Warp Prism is immediately finding a location to warp in units near the Zerg's most undefended base. This either forces the Zerg to withdraw his army completely, or leave a portion of it at home, greatly weakening the attack.

For Flanking, Zest is making sure to never attack Zerg's very powerful stationary army from one direction. Instead, Zest makes sure to be spread out, coming from as big of an arc as possible. When Lurkers are able to all attack in one direction, the damage is overwhelming, killing off many units before they can deal any damage. When Lurkers' fire has to be split in many ways, the units live long enough to also deal damage to these long-ranged siege weapons.

Joo ""Zest"" Sung Wook. Patrick Strack/ESL

For ""pre-teching,"" Zest is starting his tech units before he needs them. Like many Protosses, Zest will start with Phoenixes. While these are definitely useful for harassment and scouting, as well as complimenting your army during large battles, they are certainly an unsung hero in another way. These early Phoenixes deter the Zerg player from going for Mutalisks. With this tech path effectively cut off, Zest will skip the Twilight council in favor of early mass Immortal production. Many Protosses feel that the Immortal is really the backbone of the Protoss ground army, and Zest wastes no time getting as many as he can. They are strong against all Zerg ground units, so you almost can't have too many.

The problem is, they can become very weak late game if your opponent goes into Broodlords, or if your opponent stays in an entrenched position with mass Lurkers, static defenses, and spell casters. Zest starts to solve this problem before it arises by getting his 2nd Stargate and Fleet Beacon before any signs that he needs them. This allows Zest to build up a sizable Tempest force to deal with the Zerg late game. With these three core pieces to Zest's Protoss vs Zerg, he is certainly one of the most feared macro-players in the matchup.

Protoss vs Terran:

The matchup we've seen the most out of Zest recently is most certainly his PvT, and it does not disappoint. For the most part, Zest plays a very strong reactive style against Terran. Throughout the game, Zest pressures and does light harassment, as any good Protoss will, but is very careful about ever fully committing. Continually he will remain 1 base up on the Terran player, and 1 tech ahead as well. By keeping pressure on the Terran, Zest is getting constant information on what his plans are and what he has and is doing. This allows him the leniency to expand and tech faster than other Protoss players.

Once the Terran finally shows that an attack is inevitable, Zest has a wonderfully made army with the right units to fight Terran off after falling back into a defensive position. Most Terrans won't make it into a good enough position to make a full attack onto Zest, though. Normally his PvTs end when a Terran player starts to panic and takes a fourth or fifth base before he's ready. The second they are out of position, Zest makes a killing move immediately capitalizing on the lack of a perfectly formed defense. His instinct for blood is startlingly good for someone who would just as well sit back and play a 45 minute macro game.

Zest's play in Legacy of the Void is nothing short of amazing. He's mapped out the new game more than any other player of his race, and without doubt, will be copied heavily all year long. Look for Zest to likely win a big title this year, and most likely make it to BlizzCon even if he doesn't. En Taro Zest.",[]

1. Fabricio Werdum (20-5-1)

Nearly seven years after his release from the UFC, Werdum is the promotion's champion. He has won nine of his last 10 fights and has taken out the likes of Cain Velasquez and Fedor Emelianenko along the way. He owns one of the most impressive resumes in the game.

Next: UFC 198 on May 14, vs. Stipe Miocic

2. Cain Velasquez (13-2)

More than a 600-day layoff between fights appeared to have an effect on the now-former champion when he surrendered his belt to Fabricio Werdum in Mexico City. Velasquez has been here before. He has reclaimed the UFC belt once already. He could do it again.

Next: TBD

3. Stipe Miocic (14-2)

Miocic recorded the third sub-minute knockout of his UFC career in January, and he did it against a former champion riding a six-fight winning streak in Andrei Arlovski. He later shook hands with UFC president Dana White in a promise for the next title shot.

Next: UFC 198 on May 14, vs. Fabricio Werdum

4. Ben Rothwell (36-9)

Rothwell has found a serious groove at 34; he has won four in a row and is coming off a submission win over grappling ace Josh Barnett in January. His goal, he says, is to ""lay waste to the heavyweight division.""

Next: UFC Fight Night on April 10, vs. Junior dos Santos

5. Alistair Overeem (40-14)

A much-anticipated matchup against Junior dos Santos in December ended emphatically in the second round, when Overeem knocked out the former UFC champion with strikes. After flirting with the ""bust"" title early in his UFC career, Overeem is on a three-fight winning streak and in consideration for a title shot.

Next: UFC Fight Night on May 8, vs. Andrei Arlovski

6. Andrei Arlovski (25-11)

Arlovski's unexpected run towards UFC gold went haywire on Jan. 2, as he suffered a 54-second knockout loss to Stipe Miocic. Some will give up on Arlovski again after this loss, but in reality, one win will essentially bring him right back to where he was prior to the loss. His next fight will be an important one.

Next: UFC Fight Night on May 8, vs. Alistair Overeem

7. Junior dos Santos (17-4)

Since defending the UFC heavyweight title in May 2012, Dos Santos has recorded just two wins and absorbed what has felt like a career's worth of damage. At 31, Dos Santos is still a feared striker in this division, but following a TKO loss to Overeem on Dec. 19, we're faced with the sad reality that JDS' best days might be behind him.

Next: UFC Fight Night on April 10, vs. Ben Rothwell

8. Travis Browne (18-3-1)

Following a down year in 2015 that saw Browne fight only once (a loss to Andrei Arlovski), ""Hapa"" got to work early in the new year. His TKO win against Matt Mitrione was slightly marred by eye pokes, but it's a win (and finish) nevertheless.

Next: TBD

9. Frank Mir (18-10)

Mir's comeback trail hit a snag in September, when he dropped a decision loss to Andrei Arlovski. Still, after staring retirement in the face in 2014, Mir is suddenly a potential player again in the heavyweight top 10. A win over Mark Hunt in March would be big.

Next: UFC Fight Night on March 20, vs. Mark Hunt

10. Mark Hunt (11-10)

Sidney Crosby is back and playing with confidence again. (0:56)

BROOKLYN, N.Y. -- Pittsburgh Penguins coach Mike Sullivan earned a Stanley Cup ring with the 2014-15 Chicago Blackhawks as a member of the organization's development team. It's a special keepsake securely tucked away somewhere, but it would mean much more if he were to ever win a championship as a coach.

In order for that to happen in Pittsburgh, captain Sidney Crosby needs to lead the way.

Crosby, 28, didn't have the best start to this season. In fact, the entire team struggled out of the gate, forcing the organization to make a coaching change when it fired Mike Johnston and replaced him with Sullivan on Dec. 12.

At that time, Crosby had only six goals and 13 assists in the first 28 games. Since the coaching change, No. 87 has 22 goals and 25 assists in 37 games.

During Crosby's early-season struggles, one prominent NHLer, who has won a Stanley Cup, was asked to name the best player in the world. His answer: Crosby.

This player isn't even Canadian. He isn't American, either. He's a European player, but he didn't hesitate when asked the question. Crosby has been outstanding since the middle of December and the Penguins currently hold the first wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference.

Editor's Picks McDonald: Connor McDavid-Jack Eichel hype isn't rare The rookie sensations and top two draft picks from last year faced each other for the first time, and it didn't disappoint. Just don't try telling them that.

It's no coincidence Crosby's resurgence began when Sullivan arrived.

""Prior to the coaching change I felt like, leading up to that I was starting to play better, felt like my game was coming along,"" Crosby said. ""It doesn't happen overnight. It takes time and I felt it was going in the right direction. Obviously, when there's a [coaching] change everyone takes that to heart and realizes we've got to look in a mirror and be better, and individually I did the same thing. As a group, we've all come together and been a lot better, and when you do that individually it's better for everyone.""

Said one Western Conference scout about Crosby's resurgence: ""He's been a totally different player since the coaching change.""

During his NHL career, Crosby has played for five different coaches in Pittsburgh, including Eddie Olczyk, Michel Therrien, Dan Bylsma, Johnston and now Sullivan. When Sullivan arrived, he had a meeting with the leadership group and explained his philosophy and expectations. He wasn't asking for much.

""Everyone has their own [coaching] identity, but with him accountability is a big thing,"" Crosby said of Sullivan. ""You could tell right away no matter what position, what the detail is, it's all important. There's no big or small, every detail is important. He's very detailed when it comes to being responsible, being accountable, little things like being on time. He really pays a lot of attention to that and that's important, as far as discipline and that's helped us.""

When Sullivan was a rookie coach in the NHL for the Boston Bruins in 2003-04, Joe Thornton was the team's captain. He was 24 and had already been in the league for six seasons after the Bruins selected him with the No. 1 overall pick in the 1997 NHL entry draft.

Sullivan played 11 seasons in the NHL with four different teams and was a one-time teammate of Thornton's in Boston during his rookie season in 1997-98. When Sullivan later became coach of the Bruins, his intentions were to motivate Thornton to become a complete player. Sullivan admitted he may have over-coached Thornton, but that experience has helped Sullivan coach superstars like Crosby and Evgeni Malkin in Pittsburgh.

""One of the biggest challenges of coaching in this league is how you handle the star players,"" Sullivan said. ""It's an important relationship for the coach and the players.""

There's a fine line between how much you coach a player and how much latitude you give a player to act on his instincts.

""It's a balancing act. My experience going through the league over the last 10, 11, 12 years has helped me manage that balancing act a little bit better,"" Sullivan said.

It's amazing to think that the Penguins have won only one Stanley Cup with Crosby on the roster. That 2008-09 season seems like a lifetime ago for him. He understands the commitment and luck involved in winning a Cup and he hopes to realize that feeling once again with the Penguins.

Since Crosby hoisted the Cup in June of 2009 after beating the Detroit Red Wings, the Penguins have lost in the first round three times, twice in the second round and once in the conference finals.

""It's tough to win. The expectations are there for a lot of teams and everyone's fighting for the same thing,"" Crosby said. ""You see at the deadline, you see how many teams are making moves, trying to get that last push in to make a run. There are so many things that can happen, you need to have luck too, but it's difficult to win and you've got to put yourself in a position to win and get some bounces along the way, too.""

On Tuesday, Crosby was one of the first players on the ice for the morning skate as the Penguins prepared to play the New York Islanders at Barclays Center. Penguins assistant coach Rick Tocchet stood in the corner and fed Crosby puck after puck as he worked on receiving a pass and quickly getting a shot on net from pointblank range. His accuracy and success rate were impressive.

""What has impressed me since I've been here is just his preparation process,"" Sullivan said. ""He has an insatiable appetite for the game and to get better. He's the first guy on the ice. He's constantly trying to improve his game and get better. He's not as good as he is by accident. His preparation process is admirable and it rubs off on our team.

""When your leaders are your hardest workers, it makes it easier for the coach to come in and hold everybody else accountable to that standard and Sid's one of those guys that does that for us.""

Pittsburgh has 16 games remaining this season, and each one will have playoff ramifications. It's going to be a good test for Crosby and the Penguins if they can earn a postseason berth.

During his seven seasons as an assistant coach in the NHL, Sullivan watched Crosby dominate time and again. The two are working well together now, both on and off the ice, and that could equal a deep run in the playoffs.

""I'd much rather have him on my bench,"" Sullivan said.",[]

espn.com,,Mel Kiper has his third mock draft of 2016 with free agency considered for each pick,"['Mel Kiper Jr', 'Dan Graziano', 'Chris Forsberg', 'Mel Kiper', 'Wayne Drehs', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Bill Barnwell', 'Eric Williams', 'Royce Young', 'Jeff Goodman']","Insider

Mel Kiper Jr. breaks down the top three picks in his latest NFL mock draft and why both the Chargers and Titans could select an offensive tackle. (1:56)

Free agency doesn't change draft evaluations, only the occasional need. And I don't think it shifts needs dramatically, because it's the rare team that will tell you it was able to truly fix problems on the free-agency market. In the draft, you want core players you expect to be with the organization for years to come. You don't see these guys as fixes to immediate problems. Teams use rookies, but they don't want to have to depend on them. Free agents, on the other hand, simply aren't expected to be around for a long time.

With free agency the hot topic during the next week, here's an updated mock, and a note on how free agency could change the pick.

A player with an asterisk next to his name has a year of eligibility remaining. Two asterisks implies two years.

1. Tennessee Titans

*Laremy Tunsil, OT, Ole Miss

The top left tackle in the draft goes to a team where offensive line help is a must. I'm certain the Titans will continue to shop this pick, but it could be difficult to get a good offer.

Free-agency effect: As usual, free agency isn't exactly flush with offensive tackle help. The Titans can shop elsewhere knowing they have a tackle option here. While it's not a free-agency move, the addition of DeMarco Murray is another reminder the O-line should be a priority.

2. Cleveland Browns

Carson Wentz, QB, North Dakota State

I wouldn't rule out Cleveland taking a non-quarterback here and then getting one with the No. 32 pick, but Wentz would make sense here as a super physical talent whom new coach Hue Jackson can develop.

Free-agency effect: Is there a QB in free agency clearly better than a healthy Josh McCown, one they want to pay big dollars for? Right now, I doubt the Browns make a splash there.

3. San Diego Chargers

*Ronnie Stanley, OT, Notre Dame

The offensive line has been a major problem area going on a few years, and Stanley can be plugged in immediately. The Chargers need D-line help as well, but the draft is much deeper at that position.

Free-agency effect: If the Chargers find O-line help in free agency, it could shift the thinking here if they have players graded similarly.

4. Dallas Cowboys",[]

espn.com,,Trash and contamination continue to pollute Olympic training and competition sites in Rio de Janeiro,['Bonnie D'],"R

IO DE JANEIRO -- In August, barriers installed across more than a dozen of Rio's dying rivers will hold back garbage that otherwise might drift into the paths of Olympic sailors. A fleet of boats will patrol to keep debris from snagging on a rudder or centerboard and costing someone a medal. Some of the untreated human waste that has long fouled Rio's beaches and docks and picturesque lagoon will be diverted from competitive venues so the athletes who have to navigate them need not worry.

This is what has been promised, anyway. This is the latest stopgap wave of promises made when it was clear the first wave wouldn't be kept.

A brilliant, lowering sun silhouettes the irregular profile of the mountains behind Martine Grael as she stands on a beach strewn with sailboats after a day of racing at an international regatta on Guanabara Bay and voices her doubts. Grael, 25, is a newly minted member of the 2016 Brazilian Olympic team, the daughter of a gold medalist, a true child of these waters. She speaks with the sad conviction of someone watching a loved one suffer.

""It's very clear that water treatment and education are the biggest focus on cleaning the water, and I haven't seen almost anything being done in that way,"" Grael says. ""I think Rio has a very big coastline and people love to go to the beach, but nobody seems to care that the beach is getting dirtier and dirtier.

""The water's still dirty and it stinks some days, and, I don't know. You don't need to study a lot to understand that it's not going well.""

Rio's final 2009 bid book included a seven-year commitment to tackling an environmental disaster that took decades to create. The widespread absence of modern sanitation was spun into an asset by the leaders of Rio's campaign. The direct, flattering appeal to the International Olympic Committee was this: Bestow the transformative power of your three-week event on our city. We need the Games more than Chicago does, more than Madrid.

The bid language stated that 80 percent of overall sewage would be collected and treated by 2016, and it pledged the ""full regeneration"" of the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, where rowing and sprint canoe/kayak events will be held.

The same bid document asserted that the Brazilian economy was stable and called funding for Rio 2016 ""secure."" Six months shy of the opening ceremony, however, recession reigns, inflation rages in double digits and the Games budget has taken a significant hit. Brazil's public health system, already reeling, now must cope with the burgeoning Zika virus epidemic.

Government and organizing committee officials long ago dropped the pretense that the bid's targets for reducing pollution would be met.

""It's not going to happen because there was not enough commitment, funds and energy,"" Rio 2016 spokesman Mario Andrada told Outside the Lines. ""However, we finally got something that the bay has been missing for generations, which is public will for the cleaning.

""Nobody wants to have guests at their house and show a dirty house. So if we're not able to reach the target, we need to keep working until the last minute and make sure that the athletes can compete in safe waters, and we've been doing this.""

This is hardly the first time a gap has opened up between an Olympic sales pitch and its actual execution. Sydney struggled to meet cleanup targets in its famous harbor before the 2000 Games and is still waging the battle. Beijing 2008 was deemed ""the most polluted Olympics in history"" by researchers because of its smog, despite the Chinese government's mandate that idled cars and shut down factories. The upshot? No permanent improvement in air quality, yet Beijing will host the 2022 Winter Games.

The International Olympic Committee -- the only entity with the leverage to ride herd on bid promises -- hasn't pulled the Summer Games from a peacetime city in more than a century. IOC executive director of the Olympic Games Christophe Dubi maintained the organization's stance that the waters will be safe for competition and whatever progress can be attributed to the Summer Games is better than none.

""The situation has improved compared to what it was before, with the barriers and the boats and the pipes around Guanabara Bay,"" Dubi told Outside the Lines on Thursday. ""It's become very challenging from an economic standpoint, so what [Rio has] done already at this stage is much improved from what the conditions were at the time [the city won the bid]. It's not 80 percent [as the bid promised], but it has improved since 2009. I say it's already a super-achievement. ... It's the Games that played a catalyst role in developing infrastructure that will help citizens.""

But Brazilian-born journalist and author Juliana Barbassa, whose hopes for cleansing change in Rio swelled when the city won the bid, finds the backtracking deeply distressing. Her recent book, ""Dancing with the Devil in the City of God,"" paints an unvarnished portrait of Rio's environmental and social challenges. She says the Olympics will not result in wholesale urban alchemy, and adds that accountability for what was left undone should start and end at home.

""We had, as we say here, the knife and the cheese in hand,"" Barbassa says by phone from Rio. ""For a moment, we had the money, the political will, the deadline, the eyes of the world to deal with a very important issue that matters in the daily life of Rio residents."" The windows of her parents' home in the affluent Barra da Tijuca neighborhood are open, she says, and the smell of sewage is wafting in from the Marapendi Lagoon.

THE GRAY AREA

The same smell elbows its way through a lowered car window on the route to and from Rio's international airport, where a section of highway skirts dumping grounds on inner Guanabara Bay. A local driver tips passengers to it without flinching, wedging into the closest lane during a typically epic rush hour to give them a noseful.

Profound and intractable as the city's sanitation problems are, the precise risks to Olympic athletes competing on any given day this summer are hard to calculate. Some got sick at sporting test events last year, but none of these cases has been publicly, definitively connected to the water, as opposed to food or another source.

""Epidemiology is a science of population health, not individual health,"" says Joseph Eisenberg, a University of Michigan professor of epidemiology who studies waterborne disease pathways. ""It's statistical association, not deterministic."" In the event of a large-scale outbreak, suspect environments would be tested, he says. But no team of scientists in hazmat suits rushed to the scene to investigate the microbes that caused stomach bugs in a smattering of athletes.

Several cases received worldwide attention, amplified by the findings of an ongoing Associated Press investigation based on independent testing that revealed frightening levels of bacterial and viral contamination at and around Olympic venues. The series prompted public debate about whether Brazilian authorities should test for viruses, but the government and Rio 2016 organizers defended their methods as consistent with World Health Organization standards.

The most graphic of the athlete afflictions was a nasty skin infection that carved a chunk out of the calf of German sailor Erik Heil and later was attributed to MRSA -- a multiresistant bacterium that flourishes in hospital settings but also has afflicted some in dry-land sports.

But for now, there's no conclusive cause and effect for Heil's or any other recent case. There is only speculation, supposition and an inability to rule it out. Experts with access to raw data use models, such as the QMRA (Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment), to make projections on waterborne illness, but water quality at any of the Olympic venues can vary daily with rain, wind, currents and tide. A person's susceptibility depends on age, genetics, immune system and previous exposures.

Athletes will get multiple vaccinations, douse themselves with hand sanitizer, shower as quickly as they can after racing and resort to home remedies from Listerine to Jagermeister, but no one can guarantee what precautions might be effective.

Outside the Lines obtained a confidential U.S. Olympic Committee planning document written in October 2015 that states, ""The USOC has ongoing concerns over possible existing viral and bacterial contaminants in the water. ... The USOC remains hopeful, but we do not expect to anticipate major reductions [italics are the USOC's] in bacterial or viral pathogen levels at the competition venues.

""There is currently no way to 'zero out' the risk of infection or illness when competition occurs in any water, and especially in Rio waters,"" the document states.

The USOC does not have the authority to order water athletes to withdraw because of the conditions and is focusing instead on providing information along with beefed-up medical counsel, according to CEO Scott Blackmun.

The water's still dirty and it stinks some days, and, I don't know. You don't need to study a lot to understand that it's not going well. - Martine Grael, sailor on 2016 Brazilian Olympic team

""The water in Rio is dirty,"" Blackmun told Outside the Lines in an interview last week. ""We need to do everything we can to prevent our athletes from getting sick while they're down there. But our athletes have competed in difficult conditions around the globe on many, many, many occasions in the past, and it's just a matter of making sure our preparations are specifically targeted to the conditions we're going to find in Rio.""

Haley Anderson, who won an open-water silver medal at the 2012 London Olympics and has qualified to swim in Rio, says she will depend on her coaches, USA Swimming and the USOC to advise her truthfully about safety.

Well-meaning outsiders are ""telling you so many different things, like, 'You shouldn't, you can't swim there, there's no way,' Anderson said, sitting next to a pristine pool in Los Angeles late last year, her frustration evident. ""It's like, 'OK. You make the Olympic team and then you decide not to swim. You tell me how that goes.'""

Few athletes of any nationality care to dwell on the subject. They're trained to play the schedule and focus on what they can control. There are exceptions, such as Martine Grael, who says she has hauled discarded television sets out of the water during training sessions, and Dutch windsurfer Dorian van Rijsselberghe, the defending Olympic champion. An ambassador for the Netherlands-based nonprofit Plastic Soup Foundation, van Rijsselberghe called the conditions in Rio ""disgustingly filthy and dangerous"" in a blog written after he won the Copa Brasil de Vela event in Guanabara Bay in December:

""A member of our coaching staff almost puked while entering the Olympic harbor,"" van Rijsselberghe wrote in text translated and posted on the foundation's website.

""Raw sewage. The athletes do not talk about it. ... They are not there to challenge the world's environmental issues. But the athletes are all concerned and deeply worried.

""I am happy I won last week. Maybe I won because I had the least amount of debris on my fin.""

The contrast between Rio's topographic beauty and the horrors in its waters shocked van Rijsselberghe in his first race there in 2013. ""We had to slalom through the water to avoid plastic garden chairs, a refrigerator, [dead] animals,"" he says in a phone interview. He saw fewer large floating objects this time and knows of no Dutch athlete who got sick, but he is still disturbed by the conditions. ""It's not as simple as putting a few filters here or there,"" he says.

Other athletes admit to something that might be called anticipatory survivors' guilt. They know they can parachute into Rio for a few days or a couple of weeks and jet back to cleaner water and attentive doctors. And now that researchers are working furiously to figure out how to contain the mosquito-borne Zika virus linked to birth defects, who's going to gripe about gastrointestinal distress or a skin rash?

U.S. triathlete Sarah True, 34, is making plans designed to minimize any health roulette. She will travel to Rio just before her event, missing most of the Games and eschewing any swim training on the course off Copacabana Beach. Yet even as she focuses on one all-consuming goal, she says she can't ignore how she fits into the bigger picture.

""From everything I understand, the worst that can happen with the race is that a couple of days later, I might get a little sick,"" says True, who finished fourth at the 2012 Olympics. ""In the very large scheme of things, that's a risk I'm willing to take. I'm far more concerned for the people who live there, who were made these grand promises to improve their environment.

""They could have made some really huge changes. That was supposed to be one of the net benefits. For those promises not to be delivered on is appalling to me.""

Some put little stock in them. Rio's already diluted legacy for its waters came as no surprise to experts who understood the scope of the challenge.

""How could the [International] Olympic Committee have proceeded under the assumption that it wouldn't be a problem?"" says William Pan, a Duke University assistant professor of global environmental health. ""It's well-known in the scientific community that the water quality in Rio is not very good. It's not a surprise that athletes coming for the Olympics are really worried about being exposed to different pathogens in the water, because they are going to be.

""It's good it's coming to light. I'm not sure what to do about it. You can't clean water quickly.""

THE BOY

Pablo Nunes Meireles fidgets in his flip-flops on the deck of the mini eco-boat, eager to demonstrate how he has learned to help police his hometown waters. He is a wiry 14-year-old with black-framed glasses, holding a long-handled dip net that, along with his natural optimism, is currently his most effective weapon against the ruinous conditions around him.

The boat starts moving, scooping garbage on the surface into its belly. The boy lowers the net, its strings yellowed with use, through an open hatch and lifts it back out, emptying the contents -- a juice box, a plastic wrapper, assorted gunk -- into a bin. With his bare hand, he matter-of-factly plucks a used condom from the rim of the net and flings it into the bin. Being a good citizen is not always pretty.

Pablo and his older stepbrother Hugo live in the district of the state of Rio called Jurujuba, across the bay from the city of Rio, adjacent to the town of Niteroi. Pablo's mother, a teacher, is married to Hugo's father, a construction worker.

Their stucco-and-cinder-block house sits high on a hill in a neighborhood called Peixe Galo -- a favela without the ominous aura of the inner city, but a place where crime and drugs still detour teenagers' lives. The setting embodies the juxtaposition of Rio's rich and poor. The favela overlooks the exclusive Clube Naval Charitas yacht club, whose tennis courts and swimming pool are visible through thick foliage from homes built into the hillside.

Families like Pablo's have amenities such as flat-screen televisions, but they have to rig their own septic fields. The water from the family's sinks and toilet empties into a length of PVC that leads to a scavenged washing machine cemented into the hillside. Another pipe disperses the wastewater into the ground.

The kids in Peixe Galo and other struggling neighborhoods in the area do have access to a different kind of oasis. Down the hill and across the street is the Grael family's Instituto Rumo Nautico/Projeto Grael, perched above the water in a renovated restaurant building painted a warm shade of ochre. Its driving force is Brazil's most prominent sailing clan -- two-time Olympic gold medalist Torben Grael, Martine's father; his brother Lars, a double bronze medalist; and their older brother, Axel, whose wife, Christa, manages the institute on a day-to-day basis.

The program puts disadvantaged kids into sailboats starting at age 9. As they fall in love with the wind and sea and the freedom to choose a line, the idea is that they will learn to respect and care for the environment. They attend classes, work on the Projeto's dedicated eco-boat and learn trades such as woodworking, fiberglass repair and electronics.

""It's the only thing we have,"" Pablo says of Guanabara Bay. ""I think that folks, people looking in from the outside, see something, like, dirty, but I think it can be fixed.""

Axel Grael is the vice mayor of Niteroi and a former state environmental official who participated in his first antipollution protest in 1980 to stop sardine boats from dumping fish viscera into Guanabara Bay. Since then, he has seen a few cycles of activism and energy gather momentum and then fizzle.

""If you compare Rio with all the other Olympic cities, it's not the first time that an Olympic city doesn't reach the target,"" Grael says. ""But still, I'm sure that Rio de Janeiro is going to be the worst Olympic [sailing] course ever offered. It's embarrassing that we're offering such poor conditions. It could have been much better.""

Grael is referring to the trash dumped into Guanabara Bay, not potential illness among the sailors. He doesn't remember anyone in his extended family getting sick from the water, and he believes that won't be a problem for foreign athletes this summer. But garbage has become such a feature of Rio's oceanscape that it has to be tracked.

Last year, as part of a greater strategic plan that included designing the eco-barriers that are being constructed across the area's rivers, Projeto Grael helped develop an intelligent model to locate the bands of debris that form in Guanabara Bay, using floats with GPS to map the currents. ""The idea was to predict [one day in advance] where the garbage will be tomorrow,"" Grael says. ""The [eco-]boats are very slow. They start working at 8 in the morning. If they have to find the debris stripes, it's about time to stop for lunch.""

The valiant little eco-boats are better than nothing, but they're bandages on a gaping wound. Sailors like Brad Funk, a U.S. athlete who competes in the 49er class, have to become proficient at pulling plastic bags and other objects off rudders and centerboards as quickly as possible.

""In [other] places, you get seaweed,"" Funk says after a day of racing on Guanabara Bay in December. ""It's just a part of our sport. But it definitely happens more here, and they definitely need more boats out there.

""You're weaving in and out of trash and imagining where the center of your boat is, trying to get around pieces of furniture, or garbage bags, or animals, whatever. Then it's beautiful and blue and you're looking at the breeze. It can be an obstacle course. Especially when it rains.""

The Associated Press' testing showed high levels of viral contamination in the bay even well offshore, on the racing courses. Yet the sailors say they love Rio's singular setting and its purer challenges of wind and currents, and no serious consideration was given to an alternate site. Peter Sowrey, former CEO of sailing's world governing body, told the AP he was ousted after just five months on the job last year because he pushed for just that. The federation issued a statement saying Sowrey's claim 'surprised' officials there, and Sowrey could not be reached for further comment.

Even in the pretty little harbor where the Graels' institute stands like a beacon, there's debris visible in the water. Near a beach a few hundred yards away, a doll floats facedown, stripped of clothing, hair fanned out limply around the head. It is disturbingly humanoid, a mute rebuttal to the best of efforts.",[]

espn.com,,Khan confident against big hitter Alvarez,['Dan Rafael'],"There are many who have already written off Amir Khan as having no legitimate chance to defeat Canelo Alvarez for the middleweight world championship when they meet on May 7 (HBO PPV, 9 p.m. ET) at the new T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas.

Englands Khan has his detractors because he has had his best success in the 140-pound junior welterweight division, where he unified two world titles and beat the likes of Marcos Maidana, Paulie Malignaggi and Zab Judah, but is going to fight Alvarez at a catch weight of 155 pounds.

Khan, who has won three fights in a row as a full-fledged 147-pound welterweight -- decisions against former titleholders Luis Collazo and Devon Alexander and former junior welterweight titlist Chris Algieri in his most recent fight in May -- has also been knocked out in two of this three losses, both of which came against opponents much smaller than Alvarez (46-1-1, 32 KOs), the Mexican superstar.

But dont bother trying to dissuade Khan (31-3, 19 KOs) from his belief in himself that he can pull the upset and lift the title from Alvarez, who will be making his first defense since outpointing Miguel Cotto to win it (also at 155 pounds) in November in Las Vegas.

""When I was 17 and in the Olympics I was an underdog, Khan said on Monday as the promotion kicked off a three-city, two-country media tour with a news conference in London. No one gave me a chance of winning a medal. Everyone thought I was going to lose then. This is what this feels like now.

To the surprise of almost everyone, Khan wound up claiming a silver medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics, losing in the final to all-time great Cuban amateur Mario Kindelan, a two-time Olympic gold medalist (2000 and 2004) and three-time world amateur champion (1999, 2001, 2003).

Kindelan was one of the great amateur fighters in history and Khan was just a teenager when they met for gold. A few months after the Olympics they met in a rematch in which both would compete in their final amateur fight. Khan avenged the Olympic final loss and then turned professional while Kindelan retired.

Golden Boy Promotions CEO Oscar De La Hoya said he was not at all surprised that Khan agreed to fight Alvarez, especially after he had already been rebuffed for big fights against both Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao.

""Amir Khan is a warrior who does not avoid anyone but has been avoided, and Canelo is the No. 1 superstar in boxing and always wants to take on the very best, De La Hoya said.

Khan said he understands why people question his chances against Alvarez, but he does not question himself.

""Alvarez is a dangerous fighter, Khan said. People keep asking me why I want to fight this big fighter. I really believe I can win in this fight. What will win this fight is speed, determination and skill. My dream has always been to fight the best and test myself, and in Canelo I'm facing just that.""

Alvarez trainer Eddy Reynoso said their side is not going to take Khan lightly at all.

""We're up against a great fighter, one who is fast, Reynoso said. Many people think Amir is not worthy of this fight but he is and all the fans can expect an exciting fight from the first round.""

Williams, a 21-time Grand Slam champion, hasn't played a match since losing the Australian Open final Jan. 30, pulling out of two tournaments because of illness. She is scheduled to return to competition at Indian Wells this week.

""I'm headed out to the desert, and we'll see what happens,"" Williams said in an on-court-interview.

There were plenty of mistakes for Williams early Tuesday, many punctuated by a shriek, but as she does so often, she somehow managed to get ahead at the end of the set. The game started to look more familiar: the court coverage, the well-rounded repertoire, the big serves to escape trouble. She even tried quite a few drop shots with mixed results.

""I never miss one in practice, ever,"" she insisted.

Proving she was moving just fine, Williams earned her first set point when she sprinted to the net to run down a drop shot, and then immediately raced back to chase down a lob.

With her dogged defense, Wozniacki forced Williams into some long rallies. But as was the case in 10 of their 11 career meetings, including the 2014 U.S. Open final a few miles away, Williams' offense was too much.

In the first match of the BNP Paribas Showdown, 16th-ranked Gael Monfils of France beat two-time major champion Stan Wawrinka 7-6 (6), 6-3.

""Kelly did everything in practice, will probably do a little bit more [after Tuesday's practice] with the young guys, [and] he'll re-evaluate [on Wednesday],"" said Stevens. ""He's day-to-day. I just asked him how he was doing and he said he was a little bit tentative. He didn't play that way. He played 5-on-5 and did all of that stuff, and that was encouraging.

Olynyk, who injured his shoulder when he was fouled by Los Angeles Clippers center DeAndre Jordan on Feb. 10, sounded uncertain about his status for Wednesday.

""We'll see how it feels in the morning. See how it feels at shootaround,"" said Olynyk. ""It's hard to tell right now.""

Olynyk downplayed concerns about aggravating the injury, but stressed that the shoulder doesn't feel 100 percent yet.

""I don't know about reinjury, but it's just discomfort and pain,"" said Olynyk. ""I don't feel like I can do what I do out there at a high level right now. ... I mean, it's still sore.

espn.com,2015-05-19 13:59:18-04:00,Do Race Lotteries Violate the Law?,[],"The Ironman World Championship currently draws a field of approximately 2,000 racers, most of whom qualify. Ironman reserves 100 non-qualifier spots, which are filled with a lottery. Since 1989, Ironman has charged athletes a fee to enter that lottery. Whether or not athletes were selected to race, they were still charged the lottery fee.

Advertisement Advertisement

Last year, 12,292 lottery entrants paid a $50 fee; this year, 14,254 did. By holding these lotteries, the World Triathlon Company ran an illegal gambling business, according to the court.

This ruling could have implications in the running industry. The New York City Marathon, Chicago Marathon, Marine Corps Marathon, Beach to Beacon 10K (in Maine), and Mount Washington Road Race (in New Hampshire) are five well-known events that hold entry lotteries. The Chicago and Marine Corps Marathon lotteries are free to enter, while the New York City Marathon charges a non-refundable $11 fee per entry. Both Beach to Beacon and Mount Washington charge a non-refundable $5 lottery fee per person.

According to the Unites States code highlighted in the Ironman complaint, an illegal gambling business involves five or more people, either remains in continuous operation for at least 30 days or has gross revenue of $2,000 in a single day, and violates the law of a state.

Are Race Lotteries Gambling Businesses?

All five races have lottery field sizes larger than five people, so they meet that criterion.

The Chicago and New York City Marathon lottery windows both exceed 30 days. The lottery timeframe for the Beach to Beacon and Mount Washington Road Race are both shorter than 30 days. However, those two races could exceed $2,000 gross revenue in a day, depending on how many entries they receive.

Because the Marine Corps Marathon neither charges for its lottery entries nor operates its lottery for 30 days or more, it cannot be seen as an illegal gambling business.

Do They Violate State Laws?

Private lotteries are illegal in every state. To be considered a private lottery, three elements must be present: consideration (that is, a cost to enter), chance, and prize. Based on those requirements, the Chicago Marathon lottery does not qualify as a potentially illegal lottery, said Marc Edelman, a law professor at Baruch College, Zicklin School of Business, in New York, who specializes in gaming law: No amount of money is paid to enter the random drawing.

Edelman noted that very limited transaction fees in certain circumstances have been deemed acceptable, but that just because the New York City Marathon calls its charge a ""processing fee"" does not make it immune to the law. Requiring an individual to pay $11 to enter a random lottery where the selected winners earn the right of entry into a marathon may reasonably be construed as an illegal lottery because the elements of chance and reward are clearly present and one could make the reasonable argument that the upfront non-refundable payment of $11 in exchange for entry could be construed as consideration, Edelman said.

The New York City Marathon is managed by the not-for-profit New York Road Runners. The New York State constitution does make lottery exceptions for non-profits that benefit organizations of veterans, volunteer firefighters, and similar groups. The language is unclear as to whether the NYRR would be included in similar groups.

The Beach to Beacon and Mount Washington Road Race each charge a lottery fee of $5 per person. As the amount of money is reduced, one could make a stronger argument that the payment is merely a processing fee and not an entry fee, Edelman said.

espn.com,,Emiliano Grillo hopes tour success resonates back home,['Bob Harig'],"Emiliano Grillo explains to Michael Collins what it felt like to qualify for The Masters and possible play practice rounds with Jordan Spieth and Angel Cabrera. (2:57)

DORAL, Fla. -- Within minutes of winning for the first time on the PGA Tour, Emiliano Grillo checked his phone and saw congratulations already coming his way. There was one that immediately stood out: Jordan Spieth.

The two-time major champion who had just completed a player-of-the-year season was happy to see one of his junior rivals win the Frys.com Open last fall, tweeting his appreciation while also mentioning Justin Thomas, Patrick Rodgers and Daniel Berger.

""Cool seeing the 11s always playing great,"" Spieth wrote.

The reference was to the year 2011, when the star golfers all graduated from high school in the United States.

Grillo attended the IMG Academy in Brandeton, Florida, having decided to leave his native Argentina to pursue golf greatness. He still lives in the area and practices at the IMG golf complex, the schooling there having already paid off with a full exemption on the PGA Tour and aspirations for more.

And getting a shout out from Spieth was just further confirmation.

""Jordan of course is way higher than me,"" Grillo said prior to the WGC-Cadillac Championship, his second World Golf Championship start. ""He's got five, six wins already and two majors. That's where we'd all like to be. I can compare myself more to Justin. He's been on tour for two years already and he's also got a victory.

""It's nice to see what they are doing. It's good for me as well. I can try to do what they are doing, especially Jordan. He is No. 1 on the planet and he is my age. I don't think there is a better example for me. It's nice to see what he's doing, and I always knew if I could beat these guys in the junior ranks then I can beat everybody. And that is how I keep thinking now.""

Grillo, 23, won his first event as a member of the PGA Tour when he defeated Kevin Na in a sudden-death playoff at the Frys tournament in October. That came just two weeks after winning the Web.com Tour Championship, where he secured his status on the PGA Tour for the 2015-16 season.

Unlike Spieth (University of Texas), Thomas (Alabama) and Berger (Florida State), Grillo did not attend college. While they continued playing amateur golf, he turned pro in 2011 and toiled on the European Tour, where in 2015 he qualified for the circuit's Final Series and made it to the season-ending DP World Championship in Dubai, where he tied for fourth.

But none of that got him into the Masters. Winning the Frys.com event is what secured his first trip to Augusta National, a place he has never visited but hopes to check out in the coming weeks prior to the year's first major championship.

""To my eyes, it is the biggest tournament,"" Grillo said. I'm really looking forward to get there. I thought I would wait and see it for the first time when it is time for the tournament, but I think the smartest thing to do is go there and get to know as much as I can about it.

""Every time you say the Masters I will smile.""

Grillo said he hopes to secure a practice round with countryman Angel Cabrera, who won the 2009 Masters in a playoff and lost in 2013 in a playoff to Adam Scott. ""It just seems like a place where he turns it on when he's there,"" Grillo said.

While Cabrera is clearly a player he looks up to, Jose Coceres is more of an idol. Coceres, 52, won twice on the European Tour and PGA Tour. Along with another Argentine golfer, Fabian Gomez, that is the player whose counsel they seek the most.

""They've been here for a long time, and it's nice to play practice rounds and hang out with them,"" Grillo said. ""I've known Fabian for a long time, he's from the same city where I grew up playing [Resistencia, Argentina]. And we both look up to Jose, we have sort of been under his umbrella. It's nice to have that.""

Golf has been slow to develop in Argentina, with most of the successful pros coming to the game through caddying. (The country has less than 300 courses; Florida, alone, has more than 1,400.)

""Not that many people follow golf back at home,"" he said. ""It's getting better. I think everybody is doing the job of trying to raise the popularity and getting more people involved. I think we're on the right path. Hopefully we can get more players to join the game, especially little kids and young people who can try to do this. I know there are a few good guys out there on the Web.com and hopefully they can join us.""

Grillo managed to find his way to the IMG Academy at age 16 in 2008 and stayed there for three years. And he was not even 20 when he turned pro. Getting through the European Tour qualifying tournament and gaining experience there has been a big part of his early success, he said.

Last year, while a full-time member of the European Tour, Grillo also managed to get in seven PGA Tour events, including the Puerto Rico Open -- which was played the same week as Doral. He missed a 3-footer on the final hole that cost him a victory, relegating him to a playoff won by Alex Cjeka.

But the money earned in those limited events helped him get a place in the Web.com finals. From there, he finished ninth, tied for second, missed a cut and then won the final event.

And then he won again, amazingly, in his first tour start.

Since that victory, Grillo -- who is ranked 36th in the world -- has made nine worldwide starts, with his best a tie for fourth in Dubai. He has gotten off to a slow start in 2016, playing five events, with his best a tie for 18th at the limited-field Hyundai Tournament of Champions.

""I enjoyed the wind and then took a little time off and came back a little rusty,"" Grillo said. ""Now I'm trying to get to that point where I was playing last year. I know how hard the tour is so I need to get back to good practice so I can get back to where I was. I'm working at it.""",[]

espn.com,,"Carl Lewis -- Sebastian Coe should step aside, allow investigation","['Gordon Simpson', 'Sue Mott', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Bonnie D', 'Johnette Howard', 'Espn Staff', 'Adriana Terrazas']","BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- If Carl Lewis ran the world, Sebastian Coe would not be in charge of track and field right now.

Lewis, a nine-time Olympic gold medalist, said he believes the sport would be better served if Coe stepped aside as leader of track's governing body, let an independent organization clean things up, then took charge again.

""I think Seb Coe is smart enough, he's a great guy who can do this,"" Lewis said Tuesday. ""But at the end of the day, when you're talking about drugs and issues like this, you're talking about credibility. If he was willing to step aside and let someone independent come in and really clean this up, he'd be the perfect guy to come back in and run it.""

Coe, who was elected in August as IAAF president, is under scrutiny because he served as a vice president for the federation for years under former president Lamine Diack, who has been accused of wide-ranging corruption during his tenure.

An independent report commissioned by the World Anti-Doping Agency said members of the IAAF council ""could not have been unaware of the extent of doping"" in Russia and the breaking of anti-doping rules and ""could not have been unaware of the level of nepotism"" under Diack.

The report did not accuse Coe of wrongdoing.

Carl Lewis said for the ""credibility"" of the IAAF, president Sebastian Coe should step aside while an independent investigation is conducted, after which he could return. Todd Warshaw/Getty Images for the USOC

At a news conference to promote Los Angeles' bid for the 2024 Olympics, Lewis called track and field ""a hot mess.""

""It's not rocket science,"" he said. ""A lot of the countries that had issues, Diack ran to defend them immediately, and now we find out he's taking bribes.""

Many allegations against Diack dealt with his relationships with Russian sports and political leaders, and Lewis said he found it odd that the IAAF is trying to police Russia while its former leaders are also under investigation themselves.

Coe has received widespread support from sport leaders around the world. Most recently, the heads of the six continental track and field federations signed a statement pledging to ""unequivocally support Sebastian Coe in his role, reform proposals and actions as IAAF president for now and in the future.""

Lewis, 54, is coaching track at University of Houston and running his own program for kids ages 6-18. He has never been reluctant to sound off about the sport's many difficulties.

After Usain Bolt won three gold medals and set three world records at the Beijing Olympics, Lewis suggested the results should be scrutinized, in part because Jamaicans weren't subject to a drug-testing regimen that was as strict as that of U.S. athletes.

Lewis has been a constant critic of USA Track and Field, especially its efforts in coaching relay teams that have a penchant for dropping batons at the biggest meets. ""Embarrassing. A joke. It's silly,"" he said Tuesday, suggesting USATF hire a college track coach who would be immune to the money and political pressures that often envelop U.S teams.

Lewis said he has been calling for independent agencies on the worldwide scene since 1987, the year before he tested positive for banned stimulants. His ban was later overturned.

""I said that 30 years ago, and I'll support it now,"" he said. ""If you don't have credibility, you don't have a sport, and I think they should focus on getting the credibility.""",[]

Instead of panicking over the end of college football season, Ryan McGee focuses on what we can look forward to in 2016. (0:48)

One day after the Alabama Crimson Tide defeated the Clemson Tigers 45-40 in the College Football Playoff National Championship Presented by AT&T, the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook and several books across the strip released odds for the 2016 title.

Here are best early title value bets from Phil Steele and Will Harris.

Steele: A quick caveat about these picks: I'm currently in the process of getting my magazine together, which means I'm reading a tremendous amount of material. These are my early value bets based on which teams I think have a little value in the betting odds and how many starters they have returning.

Note: I'll release my best value bets later in the summer.

Tennessee Volunteers (15-1)

One of my favorite title value bets each season is identifying the team that is most likely to win the SEC East. The SEC West is loaded and a very tough division to win, but the East is much easier to navigate. By winning the East, a team is basically in the playoff quarterfinals. They get to the SEC title game and if they knock off the SEC West champ and have just one loss, that team will get an invitation to the playoff.

espn.com,,2016 World Championship Series Winter Circuit,"['Tomi Lurppis', 'Stephen Chiu', 'Timothy Lee', 'Tyler Fionn', 'James Bates', 'Tim Lee']","Alex ""Neeb"" Sunderhaft -- Neeb is one of the youngest players in the World Championship Series and has been playing competitively since the beginning of Heart of the Swarm. He started off as a Terran player and despite his youth and inexperience has generally had good results in WCS North America. After some time, though, he eventually reached the point all players come to when they get tired of playing the same race. He then looked up into the sky and remembered when Kim ""Classic"" Doh Woo used to play Terran, lost to Marcus ""Thorzain"" Sebastian Eklof in Proleague, switched to Protoss and eventually became a GSL and StarCraft II StarLeague Champion.

Or maybe he just really liked DTs. Whatever the case, Neeb switched races once Legacy of the Void came in and has become a much better player for it. While most of his results are online, he has shown enough skill that he is a player to watch out for to see how he does on a big stage when he as a real chance of going deep.

Choi ""Polt"" Seong Hun -- There are a lot of things you can say about Polt. He has had incredible longevity and has been playing StarCraft II since the Global StarCraft II League Open Season 1. He is one of the best players all time. The number of players that approach the game the same way he does can be counted on one hand. He has survived every patch and expansion thrown his way and has shown that even in the most imbalanced eras (BL/infestor and the Blink era), he is one of the few you can count on to find a way to win.

On the other hand, his prime passed him nearly a year ago. Ever since his victory in WCS Season 1, he has been on a steady decline in both results and skill. However, what makes Polt remarkable and so interesting to watch is that he thinks about and tries to solve the game. His entire history has him losing to a player multiple times (Stephano, Scarlett, Hydra) before figuring out how they play and beat them. It is the exact same when it comes to his bad matchups. While he isn't nearly the beast he was back in 2014 and in early 2015, he is still dangerous. He is still one of the great champions.

Theo ""PtitDrogo"" Freydiere -- After winning DreamHack Leipzig, PtitDrogo became the new French hope as he overshadowed David ""Lilbow"" Moschetto WCS run in 2015 and Alexis ""MarineLord "" Eusebio's victories over Korea in Nation Wars. PtitDrogo's notable victories at DH Leipzig were over Neeb, Dario ""TLO"" Wunsch and Aleksandr ""Bly"" Svusuyk. And while the victory there was good, the problem was that not everyone was in attendance so it was impossible to make a judgement call as to whether he was really the best player in WCS or just the best player who was there on that day.

Theo PtitDrogo"" Freydiere Adela Sznajder/DreamHack

To complicate matters, the patch hit post-DH nerfing Protoss, and this has given PtitDrogo trouble adjusting as he started dropping online series to multiple Zergs. Despite that, just in terms of pure gameplay, PtitDrogo has one of the cleanest Protoss play styles in WCS, he approaches the game in a unique way and he is still one of the favorites to contend for a championship.

Zhou ""iAsonu"" Hang -- Among the various national scenes in SCII, China has always been the most isolated. Even far off places like Australia or Taiwan have usually had at least one player represent them in international events like Moonglade or Sen. In China's case they were landlocked to China barring a few WCG's until the implementation of the WCS system in 2013. Since then they've been released unto the world leaving players and spectators shocked at how strange the metagame evolved within China. Their metagame was akin to an insane asylum and the Chinese region as a whole produced some of the strangest, funniest and most captivating games anywhere.

And in that chaos, Jim and MacSed were the favorites to come out of China until 2015. In 2015, iAsonu usurped their position as the best player from China and has held that spot ever since. Though we haven't seen much of him since WCS 2015, there is one interesting point to make. Lilbow eliminated him in season 3 and eventually went on to become champion. Lilbow decided to not practice HotS and instead practice LotV to win Golden Professional League 2015. Coincidentally, iAsonu decided the best way to get his revenge on Lilbow was to only practice LotV and eliminate Lilbow from that tournament, which he eventually did. While the brackets line up in such a way that they can only meet up in the finals, it would certainly be a rematch with just that extra bit of spice to it.

Ke ""Has"" Yu Feng -- There are certain players out there in every scene, in every game. Anyone who has ever played something competitively online for a meaningful amount of time has met them. There are players whose sole existence seems to be to annoy you, rile you up and troll you. There are those types of players and then there is Has, who is unlike those other plebians. You see the others are forced to use words, messages and out-of-game actions to annoy you. Has merely has to play the game. When other players cheese you, there is an implicit understanding between both players as to what is going on. When Has cheeses you the only thing you understand is that it is coming. You do not know how and you do not know why. Has doesn't just cheese the player he's playing against, he's cheesing the caster, the analyst, the observer and the audience all at the same time.

There is almost something artistic in the way he does it. You think to yourself, surely he can't one-up his triple cannon rush or his hail mary 4 DT rush can he? And then he 7 pylon rushes Lee ""Jaedong"" Jae Dong out of WCS. There is no one more dangerous than Has in this tournament. Not because of his skill, but because he is the best at stealing wins from anyone who is better than him in surprising and perplexing ways. It is no surprise that the Taiwanese have given him the nickname the King of Cheese. An incredible player to watch for anyone (so long as you aren't the one playing him) and living proof that evil can succeed even when good men do something.",[]
espn.com,,Plenty to think about for pace-setters at the New York City Marathon,['Sarah Gearhart'],"The grin on Stephen England's face remained steady as he walked around the Upper West Side of New York City. The 35-year-old London native who lives in Harlem had many reasons to smile -- not only because he'd just been released from the Central Park mayhem after finishing the New York City Marathon, but also because of the big, sweaty hug he received after crossing the finish line.

""I didn't even know the guy,"" England said. ""But it was really satisfying.""

It was a grateful expression from someone who'd just lowered his personal best by five minutes. The man had England to thank for it. England served as a pacer for those aiming to run the marathon in 3 hours, 30 minutes.

Fresh off the course, England talked about the experience of being a pacer -- a role filled with pressure, he said, but also responsibilities he'd willingly assume any day.

Why did you want to pace the New York City marathon instead of run for yourself?

""I love being able to give back. My health is good, and I'm physically able to do it. I like that I can help other people around me run a personal best time or potentially qualify for the Boston Marathon or simply pull them through their first marathon. It's a powerful feeling to know you've helped hundreds of people run from Staten Island to Central Park.""

How is the experience different running as a pacer as opposed to for yourself?

""It's the same experience, but I'm doing it as a volunteer. I literally do everything every other runner does. I ride a bus to the start, though it's a bus for pacers; I wear a race bib; and I run the marathon through the finish and receive a medal. It's very cool.""

What's most crucial for being a pacer?

""The knowledge of the course is huge. I know the course really well because I've lived in New York City for about 10 years. I feel as though I could run the last 10 miles blindfolded.""

Today you paced for 3 hours and 30 minutes, which averages 8-minute miles. If you were running for yourself, what do you suspect your pace would have been?

""I would have averaged about 6:18 minute miles.""

Editor's Picks Competitor: Kenyans take the elites to school Stanley Biwott and Mary Keitany faced plenty of challengers at the New York City Marathon, but the Kenyans used impeccable strategy and impressive fitness to pull away for convincing victories.

How challenging was it to slow your typical pace by almost two minutes?

""I'm a hybrid runner. I run just about every distance -- from a mile up to 200 miles -- and on roads and trails. My speed varies from a 5-minute mile to a 20-minute mile if I'm doing a really technical trail race, in which I'm basically hiking. So because I have a huge range of speed, I'm able to pace well.""

How did you get assigned to be a 3:30 pacer?

""I applied to the New York Road Runners [NYRR], which organizes the New York City Marathon. It sounds kind of nerdy, but you have to have a running resume noting what marathons you've completed or how many times you've paced races. I have been running for 25 years and have completed more than 20 marathons.

""The rule is whatever you pace, you have to be able to run 20 minutes faster. My personal best marathon time is 2:45, so I'd be permitted to pace as fast as a 3:05. It's too risky to pace for a faster goal time because you might not complete the job. It's happened before when pacers don't hit their mile time or finish time.""

Has it ever happened to you?

""I've paced about six times for various distances for the New York Road Runners. I've never run a second over my time. NYRR prefers that pacers run about 30 seconds under the goal pace.""

How did you ensure you were on your target pace today?

""I wore a Fenix 3 Garmin, which has about 50 hours of GPS. I actually didn't get GPS during the first two miles because I was on the bottom level of the first bridge. I ran about an 8:40-minute mile, which was 10 seconds off my goal. Then I ran a 7:40-minute mile for the second mile. By the time I got a GPS signal, my watch displayed a different pace than what I was actually running. I had to rely on my pace bracelet, and I also wore an elevation bracelet, which specifies what miles to go slower or faster. So at every mile I'm looking at the overall time on my watch and the information on both bracelets.""

Do you feel pressure because people are relying on you?

""Yeah, all of these people are looking to me. Two years ago when I paced the marathon for the first time, I thought, 'What am I doing here? I cannot screw this up.' Today I didn't feel as nervous. But around mile 8, I looked back and there were about 70 people behind me. When you start to think about the people, you do think about the pressure. But I know I can't be in my head like that.""

What was your communication strategy to the runners that followed you?

""Some pacers like to tell stories about New York City, but that's not really who I am as a runner. At every mile I shout crucial information, like the number of seconds over or under the pace and information about the forthcoming mile, such as if it's uphill or downhill and if we should run slower or faster. And then I stop talking.""

What are you pre-instructed to do if you cramp up and don't feel like you can maintain the projected pace?

""The rule is you're supposed to go the sideline and put your sign down -- no one else can carry it. You're allowed to finish the race if you want to. But, basically, if you cramp up, there's no pacer anymore. Today, though, we had five pacers in the 3:30 group because it's a really popular goal time, especially for women who are trying to qualify for the Boston Marathon.

What, if anything, happened today that you didn't expect?

""I had to pee at mile 2. I thought about holding it, but I really couldn't for 24 more miles. So I ran off to the side to a bunch of trees. My name was on a bib on the back on my shirt, and as I was peeing I heard a lot of people shouting my name. Then I had to relocate my group so I ran a 6-minute mile to get back, and as I did so the crowd starting cheering for me again. It was comedic.""

Though the pace sign you carried was relatively light, it's still a bit unnatural to run while holding something.

""You don't train for it. I received the sign the day before at the expo. When I was a novice pacer, I was super nice and would hold the stick high in the air. Now, I hold it a little lower. It's more comfortable that way, and people can still see it. Also, I have to hold the sign in the hand opposite of the one I wear my watch on. Changing hands doesn't work because I have to look at my watch so often. I had to run down the middle of the course as I held the pace sign. I couldn't go right or left otherwise people follow that direction. So a friend that ran with me retrieved Gatorade and water the entire way.""

What if someone attempts to run with you the entire way but falls short of the goal time?

""I feel responsible. I feel like I've failed them. I take this role seriously. As much fun as I have doing it, I still want everyone to have a success story. But it's not always possible. I can motivate people. I can tell them about the next hill, where the Gatorade and water stops are. I can mentally help them, but I can't physically carry them.""

It's challenging to run a marathon as a pacer. You have a lot to be aware of the entire race.

""Yeah, you're like team captain for many people. It's really satisfying. That's why I pace.""",[]
espn.com,,Henry Owens realizing opportunity to break camp with Boston Red Sox,['Scott Lauber'],"FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Henry Owens' odds of winning a spot in the Boston Red Sox starting rotation will increase exponentially if fellow lefty Eduardo Rodriguez begins the season on the disabled list with the dislocated right kneecap that has hampered him for the past 10 days.

But that isn't the outcome Owens prefers.

""We're all expecting Eddie to be ready for the season and give us a great year. That's what we're all looking forward to,"" Owens said Monday after tossing three scoreless innings against the Tampa Bay Rays. ""We'll just see what happens over the next couple weeks. I think I'll just play that by ear.""

In the meantime, Owens will concentrate on pitching the way he did against the Rays. Making his second spring training start, he faced 11 batters and got seven ground balls, including a rally-killing double play from Corey Dickerson in the third inning of an eventual 10-inning, 3-2 loss.

Owens is in the running for the No. 5 starter spot, although incumbent right-hander Joe Kelly has the inside track. If the swelling in Rodriguez's knee subsides in time for him to get ready to start the season and the rest of the rotation stays healthy, Owens is likely bound for Triple-A Pawtucket.

Rodriguez has been limited to long-tossing for the past six days and, according to manager John Farrell, experienced minor cramping in his calf before completing Monday's session. Considering the 23-year-old hasn't thrown off a mound since Feb. 27, he likely would need multiple bullpen sessions and perhaps even to face hitters in live batting practice before he's ready for games. But Farrell admitted Rodriguez probably has about a 10-day window to progress to the point of making his first spring training start if he's going to open the season on time.

At this point that seems unlikely, which means Owens, knuckle-baller Steven Wright and lefty Roenis Elias would be candidates to fill the void.

Even in the minor leagues Owens' biggest issue has been inconsistent command. But after drilling Rays leadoff man Brandon Guyer to open the game, he pulled it together against a Rays lineup that featured regulars Dickerson, Evan Longoria, Logan Morrison, Logan Forsythe, Steve Pearce and Kevin Kiermaier.

Owens brushed off a leadoff single by Forsythe in the second inning by getting Pearce to roll into a double play. And he escaped a two-on, none-out jam in the third.

""He's somewhat unflappable in those spots, where he's not letting the inning speed up on him,"" Farrell said. ""He doesn't try to pitch to avoid contact. Because he's able to stay controlled emotionally, he's executing to the bottom part of the strike zone and not letting that inning unravel. It was an improvement over five days ago. He was more readily able to make adjustments from pitch to pitch.""

Said Owens: ""Obviously, a pitcher aspires to go 1-2-3 every inning. In the spring, it's not a bad thing to get out of some jams. I made a couple pitches and a couple great plays behind me helped me out.""

As much as anyone, though, Owens is helping his own cause to be the choice to fill in for Rodriguez.

Third degree: It was a rough defensive day for third baseman Pablo Sandoval.

Sandoval made two errors in the fourth inning to help the Rays score two unearned runs against reliever Noe Ramirez. On the first miscue Sandoval made a low throw that handcuffed Hanley Ramirez despite his attempt to backhand the ball, a technique the Red Sox want to see from the novice first baseman. Three batters later Sandoval was unable to handle a short hop.

""You know, we're working,"" said Sandoval, who is trying to improve his first-step quickness after enduring the worst defensive season of his career last year. ""Thats one of the things we're looking for when we're here. We've been getting extra early ground balls out there.""

Together again: For the first time this spring Rusney Castillo, Jackie Bradley Jr. and Mookie Betts were reunited, from left to right, in the Red Sox outfield.

Castillo, Bradley and Betts proved to be an athletic threesome down the stretch last season. Although Castillo and Bradley in particular remain unproven as big-league hitters, the Red Sox believe their defensive ability will allow them to help the club win games even if they slump at the plate.

""We're fortunate that not only do they have good range but they all throw the baseball well,"" Farrell said. ""There's been less emphasis on the ability to throw the baseball in the outfield because you're looking for offense. You look at the athleticism and the ability to throw the baseball, of our three we're talking about here, it's impressive.""

This and that: Betts hit a leadoff homer, his first of the spring, against Rays starter Matt Moore. ... In an attempt to score from second base on David Ortiz's single to right field in the fourth inning, Xander Bogaerts ran straight through third-base coach Brian Butterfield's stop sign. Bogaerts was safe, but only because Rays catcher Curt Casali dropped the throw.

On deck: Five days shy of the one-year anniversary of tearing the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow, catcher Christian Vazquez will make his spring training debut Tuesday. Vazquez is expected to catch two innings as the Red Sox face the Orioles at 1:05 p.m. ET in Sarasota. Elias will be opposed by Orioles righty Miguel Gonzalez.",[]

The most difficult hole for the second consecutive Masters was the 505-yard, par-4 11th hole. It played to a 4.326 stroke average after playing to a 4.48 average in 2014. The easiest hole was the par-5 13th hole, which had a 4.546 average. The 17th hole, in its second year without the Eisenhower Tree, played to a 4.155 average, the seventh-most difficult hole. In 2014, it played to a stroke average of 4.24, which tied for sixth most difficult on the course. The 2014 average was the highest stroke average on No. 17 since 2006, when it played to a 4.285 average, the second hardest that week.

Patrick Reed had a difficult start to his final-round 70. On the second hole, he hit 3-wood off the tee and the face of his club caved in. Having to play this place without a 3-wood and only a driver, it made it tough, Reed said. I guess the aggressiveness helped at some points, but also it got me in trouble on a couple holes. But I was able to manage...I literally have a hole in the golf club. I hit it right in the face and the whole face completely caved in. I can see all the way inside the head.

espn.com,,"Team Liquid, Evil Geniuses come out on top for Shanghai's Group D","['Timothy Lee', 'Tyler Fionn', 'Tomi Lurppis', 'James Bates', 'Tim Lee']","The group stages have ended, and it's looking like an explosive main event for Shanghai. The last group featured Evil Geniuses, compLexity Gaming, Team Liquid, and Virtus.pro. This was arguably the most evenly matched group of the entire stage, with every team realistically carrying a chance to qualify for the upper bracket.

Evil Geniuses, one of the tournament favorites, are characterized by their strong drafting from PPD, carry play and adaptability. Virtus.pro, the inconsistent and talented roster, boasted a individually intimidating lineup and excellent team-fighting skill. Team Liquid was the second strongest team in the group, with their two amazing carries with balanced support play behind it. And lastly, the wildcard was the reworked compLexity Gaming and their mix of Swedish and American players.

Evil Geniuses against compLexity Gaming

The first toss-up matchup of the group pitted Evil Geniuses' stacked lineup against the unknown factor of compLexity Gaming.

The first game was a perfect example of why Evil Geniuses was not an automatic lock to win the group -- compLexity Gaming was every bit as good as the North American team. Behind the great start and carry play of Linus ""Limmp"" Blomdin's Tiny and the threat of a stronger team fight, Evil Geniuses was reduced to split-push and small skirmishes. As a result, the game boiled down to whether compLexity Gaming could force a favorable fight and if Evil Geniuses could trade out evenly. Finally, with a pick-off of Artour ""Arteezy"" Babaev, compLexity Gaming crushed through Evil Geniuses' base and forced the fight they absolutely wanted for complete control and the eventual Game 1 victory.

Game 2 started similarly with Evil Geniuses controlling the lane phase, but this time they had the superior team fighting capabilities behind Tidehunter and Queen of Pain. With the scouting of Arteezy's Clinkz and constant pressure from the rest of the lineup, Evil Geniuses sealed Game 2 in very quick fashion.

Like clockwork, both teams matched speed for speed in the rubber match. If it wasn't a building taken, it was Roshan or a big fight, but Evil Geniuses took the edge early. Although there was some resistance, the combined net worth of Evil Geniuses' carries, Arteezy and Syed ""SumaiL"" Hassan, ran circles around the rest of the team. In the end, compLexity Gaming's odd draft and timings was their downfall.

What we learned: Evil Geniuses are not without their weaknesses, but the execution and individual mechanical skill of the lineup is insane. CompLexity Gaming is a threat. As evidenced to their Game 1 victory, they can play with anyone.

Virtus.pro against Team Liquid

The second of the toss-up matchups pitted two of Europe's finest teams against the other. Would the inconsistencies of Virtus.pro plague them? Or will Team Liquid's reliance on their two carries prove too much?

Team Liquid started Game 1 by hitting Virtus.pro in the mouth with their team fight execution and controlled the map through multiple ganks on key heroes. They slammed down the pressure and never allowed Virtus.pro to get a good hold of the momentum. Whether it was vision control, capitalization of big mistakes (for example, Roshan pit fight) or forced fights, Team Liquid never trailed in a dominating start to the set.

In a pace-up Game 2, Team Liquid attempted to snowball their laning dominance for a very fast two-game set. Behind the play of Adrian ""FATA"" Trinks -- and his Puck -- the speed and strength of their lineup allowed them to kill more heroes than minutes played for the entirety of the early game. Amazingly, Virtus.pro's superior defense, the play of G's Templar Assassin, smoke ganks for objectives, and overall poise to keep the game in a standstill. Behind a successful Roshan gank and team fight, Virtus.pro pulled away with multiple pick-offs and tied the kill score at 24 with the late game in their favor. It took one more clash between the lineups for Team Liquid to throw in the towel and complete the Virtus.pro comeback.

The beginning of Game 3 saw both teams trade out fights and rotations, but the farming priority and advantage fell upon the shoulders of the two carries from Virtus.pro. The lead climbed after a big clash that Team Liquid initiated on, but Virtus.pro finished through an exorcism, vacuum and wall combination from Virtus.pro that really put Team Liquid on the backburner. With the winning fight, objectives fell and Roshan was Virtus.pro's to claim. Team Liquid would split-push, defend their base and stall out the game (even claiming the Roshan from Lasse ""Matumbaman"" Urpalainen's Ursa), and it made the game into a battle of inches. Finally, with a split team fight, Virtus.pro used their exorcism and superior farm to crush through Team Liquid's lineup and the set.

What we learned: Both teams deserve consideration for the upper bracket as the talent is apparent. For Virtus.pro, their skill in team fighting is still as relevant as ever. And Team Liquid's comeback mechanic is undeniable.

Evil Geniuses against Virtus.pro

Valve

The decider match to enter the upper bracket was a battle of similar styles. Both deploy two great carry players, high-impact offlane players and world-class supports. The difference between the two is just consistency.

Game 1 began with a slow lane phase transition to the midgame, while both teams equipped the best tools to fight the other. Smokes were met with smokes, ganks were answered immediately with one on the other side and the stalemate extended into the late game. It was clear that the winner would come down to a mistake from the other side. Evil Geniuses recognized the great organized team fight execution of Virtus.pro and took their lead with a chaotic split team fight where they isolated the supports and cores from the other. One fight, several ""diebacks"" and one failed base defense made up the climatic finish of Game 1.

Game 2 was a change of pace with both teams opting to fight early and often. Evil Geniuses' itemization and superior farming abilities edged them to the lead over Virtus.pro despite the stalemate on the map. A disastrous base siege allowed Virtus.pro to even out the farming advantage, but the superior pushing abilities of Evil Geniuses allowed them to continue to mount pressure on the opposing structures. All went to a head when Evil Geniuses threw bodies into Virtus.pro's base to destroy their barracks and succeeded in taking the majority of it at the expense of the fight. The rats of Evil Geniuses continued to pressure Virtus.pro's defenses, but eventually the power of creeps tipped the game in favor of North America.

Team Liquid against compLexity Gaming

Both teams boasted unique styles with Team Liquid's resource equilibrium behind their two great carry players and compLexity Gaming's aggressive drafts and fast rotations. It was an example of how great adaptation and defense win games.

CompLexity Gaming couldn't ask for a better start with a Bounty Hunter and fast blink dagger from Slardar wreaking havoc. Team Liquid would not be overwhelmed and punished every overextension or wrong move and stalled out the initial momentum. Behind the farmed Matumbaman"" and great initiation from the Beastmaster, Team Liquid took firm control of the game. CompLexity Gaming would desperately attempt multiple pushes to end the game, but Team Liquid held and held until they finally pushed back and finished the game.

Game 2 was all Team Liquid: They were allowed to pick comfort picks and counters to any early aggression and their lane phase was dominant. With the aid of better power spikes, rotations and sustain, Team Liquid pressured barracks at the 22-minute mark and constantly camped out at compLexity Gaming's side of the map. There just wasn't enough damage to push out Team Liquid as they lose the set to send them to the lower bracket.

Team Liquid against Virtus.pro

Game 1 of the rematch was all Team Liquid from the beginning. Virtus.pro was punished over and over again for their greedy extensions, and Team Liquid's rotations, team fight composition and burst damage were the absolute killer in this matchup. With every outer tower destroyed, Team Liquid controlled the map for the entirety of the early game through the midgame. The big fight that is a signature for Virtus.pro's games happened when the Phoenix, Death Prophet and Witch Doctor ultimate combination wiped Team Liquid's entire lead. The split push of Nature's Prophet and Gyrocopter forced Virtus.pro's hand, but Jesse ""JerAx"" Vainikka's Tusk stopped all of the teleports and the barracks and map control fell back into Team Liquid. From there, Team Liquid wiped out Virtus.pro's hopes with a successful team wipe after the Roshan take and finished off the first game.

Virtus.pro would lane better in Game 2 and kept the kills in their favor for the early game. Team Liquid's response time in rotations, objective takes, and Roshan decisions were perfectly countered off most of the advantage. Even Team Liquid's mistakes or initiations worked in their favor as Virtus.pro continued to lose ground and fights with every engagement. The mistakes piled on, and Team Liquid snowballed their team fight into the Virtus.pro's side of the map. Eventually, the superior pushing abilities of Death Prophet and Nature's Prophet of Team Liquid ignored the comeback factor of Virtus.pro for the set victory.

So, there you have it. Group D was the end of the group stages and it should be a ridiculously entertaining main event.",[]
espn.com,,Billy Joe Saunders to defend middleweight title against Max Bursak,"['Dan Rafael', 'Pa Sport', 'Brian Campbell', 'Nigel Collins']","Middleweight world titleholder Billy Joe Saunders is taking the path of least resistance.

Saunders, offered a career-high payday in the low seven figures to face Gennady Golovkin in a title unification fight on April 23, turned it down and instead will defend against Max Bursak. Saunders and Bursak will meet on April 30 at the Copper Box Arena in London, promoter Frank Warren announced Monday at a news conference in London.

Unable to secure a deal with Saunders, Golovkin's team made a deal for him to fight mandatory challenger Dominic Wade instead. Days later, Saunders called Golovkin out to unify titles with him even though he had just rejected the lucrative, high-profile fight. Weeks later, Saunders' bout against Bursak, who is 3-3 in his past six fights, was announced.

""Nothing comes easy in boxing, and I'm definitely not taking Bursak for granted,"" Saunders said.

""He's a good, good fighter and very dangerous, and if I don't come in 100 percent, then he could cause an upset in my first title defense. I've worked long and hard to get where I am, and look at the massive fights ahead of me against the likes of Golovkin.

""So, no, I'm going to make sure I'm in perfect shape and give Bursak the toughest night he's ever had. He's never been stopped before, so that's something I'm looking at doing.""

Saunders (23-0, 12 KOs), 26, of England, claimed the 160-pound belt on Dec. 19 in Manchester, England, as he knocked down Ireland's Andy Lee twice in the third round and won a tactical majority decision.

Bursak (32-4-1, 15 KOs), 31, of Ukraine, the former European middleweight champion, has never beaten a top contender but has faced experienced opponents, including in a decision loss for an interim world title against Hassan N'Dam in 2012.

Bursak, who has also lost decisions to former world title challengers Martin Murray and Jarrod Fletcher, said he was thankful for the opportunity Saunders is giving him.

""Thank you to Billy Joe Saunders for giving me a shot at the world title. Unfortunately for Saunders, this is going to be his first and last defense of the title because I will be taking the title off him when I face him on April 30,"" Bursak said. ""I am telling Saunders to be prepared and train hard because he will be in for the fight of his life and I will be looking for the knockout.""

Warren also announced a pair of undercard bouts.",[]
espn.com,,Thunder SF Kevin Durant on Finals-or-bust ultimatum: Never said that,"['Espn Com', 'Royce Young']","OKLAHOMA CITY -- Kevin Durant shot down a circulating rumor Tuesday that the Oklahoma City Thunder are operating with a Finals-or-bust ultimatum in relation to his future free agency.

""To me, it doesnt [make sense],"" Durant said of placing an ultimatum on the team. ""You put too much pressure on everybody if you say something like that. Especially my teammates and the organization. They don't deserve that. So I never said that, I never thought that.

""Like I said, I can't control rumors from people who sit behind their desk every day and think of stuff to say. I'm worrying about coming out here every day and staying healthy and trying to battle against the best players in the world while rumors are getting written up about whatever, and I have no control over it. That's their job, and my job is to play ball. So I never said that.""

Kevin Durant said Tuesday he has not given the Thunder an NBA Finals-or-bust ultimatum regarding his impending free agency. AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez

The origin of the report came from Sirius XM Radio host and New Orleans Pelicans play-by-play broadcaster Joel Meyers saying if the Thunder don't make the NBA Finals this season, Durant will leave in free agency.

""I made some calls over the weekend,"" Meyers said. ""If they don't, I'm told if they don't at least get to the NBA Finals, Durant's gone. Simple as that. And to the point where he may want his own team.""

The rumor is one of many increasing free-agency ripples around Durant, after he spent the majority of the season escaping the churning rumor mill.

""There have been a lot of rumors out there,"" Durant said. ""I wouldn't say it's been totally quiet, but it's been cool, it's been different. I was expecting a lot, every city I go to, everybody to ask me questions, but it's been pretty quiet. Once July hits that's when everybody will care. They're just worried about the season. There's a lot of stuff going on. A lot of great players and teams playing well this year, so I'm not the focus.""

Last summer at USA Basketball, Durant made it clear his circle is very tight and unless something was coming from him, his agent, his manager or the team's PR director, to ignore it. And Tuesday, he reiterated that.

""If it didnt come from me or anybody I know, like I said in the summertime, I dont know where it came from,"" Durant said. ""Everybody makes up rumors around this time of year and everyone wants clicks for their stories, so thats a part of it. I have nothing to do with that. I cant control it. Im just focused on playing better each and every game.""

The idea that it's title-or-bust -- or in this case, Finals-or-bust -- is a pretty shortsighted one, because with all the variables that go into the postseason, placing that much significance on an isolated series overlooks the importance of both the future and the past in the decision. As Durant knows all too well, injuries can derail an otherwise promising situation. Like he said himself, that type of mindset doesn't make sense.

Obviously the better the Thunder do in the playoffs the better they make their case to Durant to re-sign in Oklahoma City, but they've also been making a pretty strong case the past seven seasons. The Thunder have sustained their status as a contender, with uncontrollable variables -- i.e., injuries -- being the biggest roadblock during that time.

There has been no championship, and that's the topping on the cake. Without a title, the door remains open for a wandering eye.

The closer July 1 gets, the more Durant's decision will come into focus. There are a lot of options available to him, with probably the most pragmatic being to sign a one-year deal and to delay this circus one more year. (The thinking: With the spiking salary cap coupled with the fact Durant would hit 10 years of service, making him eligible for a 35 percent max contract, he'd be looking at a difference of roughly $85 million.)

For Durant, he's prepared for these types of stories, and he wasn't bothered Tuesday by having to answer the questions that come along with them. He calmly stood and took in each one, and he gave a strong, thoughtful response one-by-one. He's not searching out the drama; he just knows it'll find him.

""I come in here and I hear it a lot. I may turn on the TV here and there and then I see it, go on social media and you see it all the time,"" Durant said. ""It's hard to get away from it. But my family and my friends do a good job of shielding me away from that stuff, and I just try to take it with a grain of salt and move on and know it's a part of the business and know it's a part of this game.""",[]

espn.com,,"After Braves, Andrelton Simmons moves on with Angels","['Jerry Crasnick', 'Eddie Matz', 'Scott Lauber']","TEMPE, Ariz. -- Talented young players like to think they'll be among the fortunate few to spend their entire careers in a Derek Jeter-Craig Biggio state of bliss with their first organization, and Andrelton Simmons was no different. The pride of Mundo Nobo, Curacao, won his first Gold Glove with the Atlanta Braves at age 24, signed a seven-year, $58 million contract extension shortly thereafter, and had every reason to believe he would remain with the club for the move to the new ballpark in 2017.

Reality typically intervenes when a player gets too old or expensive to keep around, or an organization changes direction. During the GM meetings in November, Simmons' name began popping up in trade rumors. The hammer dropped when he received a phone call from the Atlanta front office telling him he had been traded to the Los Angeles Angels.

New Los Angeles Angels shortstop Andrelton Simmons can field his position with the best of them, but he can also put his bat on the ball. Kevin Sullivan/The Orange County Register via AP

Three months have passed since the news, and a life-changing event can now be filed away as just another winter transaction. Simmons is lockering between Albert Pujols and Mike Trout this spring and preparing to play home games in the shadow of Disneyland, so why waste time being bitter?

""It's like breaking up with your first girlfriend,"" Simmons said. ""It's a little heartbreaking at first. You plan like it's gonna be forever, and after it's over, you wish them the best. I'm with my new girlfriend now, and I'm focused on this team and helping them win now.""

While it's unclear if the Angels were attracted to Simmons because he likes puppies and long walks on the beach, Los Angeles' front office fell head over heels in love with his ability to cover ground at shortstop and turn base hits into outs. Sooner rather than later, the two parties will learn if theirs is a match made in first-division heaven.

For much of the winter, rumors swirled that the Angels would add some heft to the offense by signing a free agent with the pedigree of Jason Heyward, Justin Upton or Yoenis Cespedes, but they ultimately settled for a Craig Gentry-Daniel Nava platoon in left field. New general manager Billy Eppler also took a measured approach at second base, passing on Daniel Murphy and Howie Kendrick and bringing in Cliff Pennington on a short-team deal to provide some competition for incumbent Johnny Giavotella.

Amid numerous reports that the Angels refrained from big-ticket acquisitions because owner Arte Moreno was intent on staying below MLB's $189 million luxury tax threshold, Eppler offers a more nuanced summary of events.

""It's like breaking up with your first girlfriend. It's a little heartbreaking at first. You plan like it's gonna be forever, and after it's over, you wish them the best. I'm with my new girlfriend now, and I'm focused on this team and helping them win now."" Andrelton Simmons, on his trade from Atlanta to Anaheim.

""That became the narrative, but it's not something that was a mandate,"" Eppler said. ""From our standpoint, the timing and the circumstances did not really intersect. When I say timing, I'm talking about the term [of the contract]. The circumstances were the financial impact. They never intersected at a point where we felt comfortable making that decision.""

The lone departure from the Angels' blah offseason came when Eppler sent pitching prospects Sean Newcomb and Chris Ellis, veteran shortstop Erick Aybar, and $2.5 million in cash to Atlanta for Simmons and catcher Jose Briceno. The move elicited a collective ""wow"" from Angels players monitoring the Hot Stove.

""It was kind of crazy,"" outfielder Kole Calhoun said. ""Being an Angel, I've only known Erick Aybar as our shortstop. That guy has been a staple and a rock in our clubhouse for years. To see him move, my initial feeling was, 'Man, that's a teammate and a friend who's not going to be with us.' Then you hear we're getting Simmons in return, and the excitement kicks in. You realize you're going to get to play with a guy who's an incredible talent and one of the best shortstops in the game. Very cool.""

Simmons changes the dynamic in Anaheim with his run-saving ability. But at what cost? Newcomb stands 6 feet 5, 245 pounds, throws a fastball in the mid-90s and is considered potential top-of-the-rotation starter material, and Ellis has a chance to be a solid middle-rotation type. They were the best of a weak crop of minor leaguers in Anaheim, and their departures have generated reviews of the Angels' talent pipeline that range from merely critical to ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2""-caliber scathing.

ESPN's Keith Law, like Baseball America, ranked the Angels' farm system last among the 30 MLB teams in advance of the 2016 season. ""I've been doing these rankings for eight years now, and this is by far the worst system I've ever seen,"" Law wrote in February.

Though Eppler acknowledges how painful it was to tap the minor-league pipeline, he cites a ""scarcity issue"" as the main impetus behind the Simmons trade. The Angels assessed their options and couldn't resist the opportunity to fill a short-term hole and a long-term need by acquiring a 26-year-old, middle-infield dynamo.

Eppler, who left a job in the Yankees' front office to become the Angels' GM in October, gained an appreciation for the importance of shortstop stability through 10 years of watching Jeter in the Bronx.

""There was a time period in New York where we knew, 'Hey, someday we're going to need a shortstop,' "" Eppler said. ""But it's something you end up taking for granted year after year when you have Mr. Reliable and Mr. Clutch out there. In my estimation, if shortstop isn't the most important position, it's the second most important position on the field defensively [behind catcher].""

High-contact guy Andrelton Simmons is acclaimed for his Gold Glove defense, but the Angels also like him for his ability to put the ball in play. Simmons ranked second among NL hitters in 2015 in lowest strikeout rate per plate appearance. Hitter Team K/PA Daniel Murphy Mets .071 Andrelton Simmons Braves .082 Buster Posey Giants .083 Yangervis Solarte Padres .098 Ender Inciarte Diamondbacks .103 (Minimum 502 plate appearances)

Although Simmons lost out to San Francisco's Brandon Crawford in National League Gold Glove balloting last season, he still ranked an impressive second to Crawford among big league shortstops with 20 defensive runs saved and added to his smorgasbord of YouTube highlight clips. He has dazzled his new teammates early in camp with his slick footwork and legerdemain during back-field drills.

""First of all, he's super quick,"" Pennington said. ""He doesn't appear to be rushed in any way. Some of the guys here can probably do the feeds as fast as him if they're trying to do it, but that's just his normal.

""He's got a cannon, but he also has a quick release and the ball is on the money every time. Some guys have good arms, but their ball runs a lot and it can be tough on a first baseman. His [throws] are like catching a pillow.""

While Simmons clearly upgrades the Angels' defense, he is not an ideal fit in some respects. According to Fangraphs, the Angels' staff ranked last in the majors with a 41.5 percent ground ball rate in 2015; it's much more of a fly ball group. And Giavotella, Simmons' new double-play partner, ranked 34th among MLB second basemen with a defensive runs saved of minus-12, according to Baseball Info Solutions. Simmons might help compensate for Giavotella's shortcomings, but Pennington could be the better fit if the Angels plan to stress defense.

At the plate, Simmons fits right in with manager Mike Scioscia's desire to move runners and put pressure on opposing defenses with the hit-and-run. Simmons hit only four home runs last season, down from a high of 17 in 2013. But he gets the bat head to the ball and had the 12th best contact rate of any hitter in the majors in 2015.

As he eagerly awaits the transition to the American League, in a new city on a different coast, Simmons is tending to details in both his baseball and personal life. He's in the process of finding a place near Anaheim, and lots of people have offered suggestions.

""People say, 'Live next to the beach,' "" Simmons said. ""I came from an island [Curacao], so I've lived next to the beach. It's not a priority for me.""

Priority No. 1 this season will be acclimating on the field and making the Angels feel good about taking the plunge for him. Hearts mend, new relationships form, and each day brings another game. As long as Andrelton Simmons packs his glove for the trip to Anaheim, he should be fine.",[]

Every year, we see NBA rookies have a tough time making any kind of positive impact in the regular season as it relates to winning games. The NBA game has grown so specialized and nuanced that it barely resembles the college game anymore. So it is unreasonable to expect newly drafted players to excel in summer league.

For many of them, this is their first taste of pro basketball. Factor in very few practices during the summer, no set rotations, inexperienced coaches and the drain on their brains and bodies from months of pre-draft training, and we get a collection of talented players who don't look quite like themselves in July.

Still, it's worth checking out the rookies to see what teams saw when they drafted these young men. Here are my early observations on the lottery picks from the 2015 draft:

Rookie Watch

Karl-Anthony Towns

Timberwolves | C

2015 NBA draft:

No. 1 pick

Key summer-league stats:

12.8 PPG, 7.2 RPG, 1.8 BPG, 39.6 FG%

Towns' elite-level potential was on full display in Vegas. The big man out of Kentucky utilized a nice jump hook, showed good speed racing up and down the court and blocked some shots as a helper as the week progressed.

He is years away from being a dominant player, but reaching that status is in his wheelhouse for sure. Focusing on defense would be a good place for him to start during his rookie season, given Minnesota's need for rim protection.",[]
espn.com,,Luke Rockhold-Chris Weidman rematch to headline UFC 199,['Brett Okamoto'],"A middleweight title rematch between Luke Rockhold and Chris Weidman will headline UFC 199 on June 4 in Inglewood, California.

UFC president Dana White officially announced the event on Friday. The pay-per-view event is scheduled to take place inside The Forum.

Additionally, a bantamweight title fight trilogy between Dominick Cruz and Urijah Faber will serve as the co-main event.

Rockhold (15-2) claimed the 185-pound championship by defeating Weidman via fourth-round TKO at UFC 194 in December. A former titleholder in Strikeforce as well, Rockhold, 31, has won five in a row.

Weidman (13-1), who fights out of LAW MMA in New York, is coming off his first career loss. Prior to forfeiting the belt, Weidman had defended it three times against Anderson Silva, Lyoto Machida and Vitor Belfort.

Cruz (21-1) is coming off a split decision win against TJ Dillashaw in January, in which he reclaimed the 135-pound title he lost in 2014 due to injuries. The San Diego-based bantamweight's only professional loss came to Faber via guillotine choke in 2007.

Faber (33-8) will look to make good on his fifth UFC title shot. He is 0-4 in previous attempts, including a five-round unanimous decision loss to Cruz at UFC 132 in 2011.",[]

espn.com,,"Daily fantasy sports legal in Rhode Island after review, attorney general says","['Steve Fainaru', 'Paula Lavigne', 'Darren Rovell', 'Ben Fawkes', 'David Purdum']","PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Rhode Island's attorney general says daily fantasy sports are legal under state law.

Attorney General Peter Kilmartin said Thursday he conducted a review and has forwarded the findings to fellow Democrats Gov. Gina Raimondo, Senate President Teresa Paiva Weed and House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello.

Daily fantasy sports participants put together virtual teams based on real players and compete for points based on the players' statistics. Attorneys general in several states have found the games are illegal.

Kilmartin says in Rhode Island the question depends on whether chance is a dominant factor in determining how prizes are distributed. He finds daily fantasy sports are a mixture of chance and skill and are therefore allowed. He's encouraging lawmakers to establish regulations.

Boston-based fantasy sports website DraftKings says it's pleased and it's working with Rhode Island legislators to enact ""appropriate regulations.""

""We agree with the Attorney General's opinion that daily fantasy sports are games of skill and legal under Rhode Island law,"" DraftKings attorney David Boies said in a statement. ""And we are pleased that his legal opinion supports the view of certain other Attorneys General, experts, fans, and many policymakers that there is no legal distinction between season long and daily fantasy sports.

""We also agree that the legislature is the appropriate place for any additional regulation of fantasy contests,"" the statement said. ""That is why we are working actively with legislators in Rhode Island and across the country to enact thoughtful and appropriate regulations that allow our fans to continue enjoying the contests they love.""

espn.com,,Tom Dumoulin aiming for Olympics in wake of Giant-Alpecin crash,"['Andrew Hood', 'Sarah Gearhart', 'Competitor Com', 'Gregor Brown', 'Rico Longoria', 'Phil Gaimon', 'Roger Robinson', 'Doug Williams', 'Pa Sport', 'Mario Fraioli']","Editor's note: This article originally appeared at VeloNews.com.

MUSCAT, Oman (VN) -- Tom Dumoulin might have dodged a bullet, but he is feeling the repercussions of a Jan. 23 head-on collision between his Giant-Alpecin teammates and a car. The Dutchman, who is aiming for the Giro d'Italia and the Olympics this year, said the incident is a setback for the entire team.

Dumoulin passed the same stretch of road near Alicante, Spain, 10 minutes before the crash. Then, a car drove from the other direction and hit six of his teammates head-on. American Chad Haga suffered a fractured eye socket, 2015 Milano-Sanremo and Paris-Roubaix winner John Degenkolb nearly lost a finger, and Max Walscheid broke his leg.

""It's definitely a big impact on the beginning of the season,"" Dumoulin said Monday when arriving in Muscat for his first race of 2016, the Tour of Oman.

""The team will definitely have a different early season and classics season. John was the guy for the spring season, but that changed completely. Now we don't have a big winner. It's definitely difficult. We have no victories so far, one of the few WorldTour teams. It's just about accepting that the results will be less than we hoped for.""

The team started the Tour of Oman on Tuesday with seven riders instead of eight. In last week's Tour of Qatar, it fielded only five.

""My program stays the same. There are going to be some races where we are six riders, it's going to affect the results,"" Dumoulin added. ""Let's say I take the leader's jersey in the first stage of the Tour of Oman, it's definitely going to be harder to keep it. We made those choices, in some races we will have less riders.""

Dumoulin finished fifth in the Oman opener and is 18 seconds out of first place.

Degenkolb will have to aim for other goals, such as stage victories in the Tour de France. Haga was due to start his season in the Tour of Qatar, but he now has to recover first. Warren Barguil, who fractured his scaphoid in the crash, is still the team's leader for the Tour.

Dumoulin gained attention in the Vuelta a Espana last August and September when he won two stages and nearly took the overall title. He led for several days thanks to his time trial and improved strength on the climbs, but Fabio Aru and his Astana gang cracked Dumoulin on the final mountain stage. In the red leader's jersey, he slipped 3:52 behind and finished the day -- and eventually the race -- sixth overall.

The experience has not changed Dumoulin's top goal this season, which is winning the time-trial gold medal in the Rio de Janeiro Olympics on Aug. 10. The 25-year-old will race the Giro d'Italia in May, but instead of the overall, he will try to win the opening time trial and the Chianti time trial.

""I will definitely be Tom-the-cronoman in 2016, and not Tom-the-GC-man. We will postpone that for one more year,"" he said. ""The Vuelta came so suddenly. It was a nice and special experience, but I don't want to go with the flow and be the big GC man now. That was never the plan. Why should we give that all away now and go full-on for GC now? I started to think, 'That's not what I really want.'

""The Olympics were the biggest thing in my childhood. That was the highest thing you could achieve in sports, to get a medal or a gold medal in the Olympics. Now I have that chance, so I want to put everything else aside this year.""",[]

espn.com,,Don't give up on Joc Pederson: 10 NL players to like for 2016,"['Jerry Crasnick', 'David Schoenfield', 'Stacey Gotsulias']","Last week, I looked at 10 American League players I like for 2016 -- whether we're talking fantasy baseball or real baseball. Here are 10 National Leaguers high on my draft lists:

1. Joc Pederson, CF, Los Angeles Dodgers

Joc Pederson hit 26 home runs as a rookie last season, 20 of which came in the first half. AP Photo/Ross D. Franklin

A lot of people seem to have given up on Pederson after that disastrous second half in which he hit .178 with just six home runs after cracking 20 in the first half. Pederson is always going to be more valuable in real life than fantasy because his high walk rate translates to a good OBP -- even last year, when he hit just .210, he posted a .346 OBP, a higher mark than Mookie Betts or Ian Kinsler or Adrian Beltre or Robinson Cano or Kyle Seager or Carlos Gonzalez or any number of players that fans aren't down on. Everyone just hailed the Dexter Fowler signing: Pederson had the same OBP and higher slugging percentage than Fowler. Look, Pederson is never going to be a high-average hitter with all the strikeouts and maximum-effort swing, but he's going to get on base and he's going to hit home runs.

2. Michael Conforto, LF, New York Mets

He's a smart kid who understands hitting and more than held his own in the majors -- .270/.335/.506 -- while debuting barely a year after getting drafted out of Oregon State. The Mets didn't play him much against left-handers and there is a chance he ends up in a platoon with Juan Lagares (with Yoenis Cespedes switching back and forth between center and left), but I also think there's a strong likelihood Conforto hits himself into a regular spot in the lineup and Lagares is reduced to a bench role and defensive replacement.

3. Daniel Murphy, 2B, Washington Nationals

Murphy's power surge in the postseason was the culmination of tweaks he made with his swing during the season. Though his final batting line fits right in with the rest of his career -- .281/.322/.449 -- it's how he finished the season that raises optimism that he will continue to hit a few more home runs. In the final two months he hit .296/.321/.533 with eight home runs and 19 doubles in 212 plate appearances. Here is the impressive thing though: He struck out just 14 times. For the season he cut his strikeout rate from 13.4 percent to 7.1 percent (lowest in the majors among regulars). Despite the additional balls in play his average actually dropped from .289 to .281, which doesn't correlate. If he maintains that low K rate look for him to hit .300 -- with more extra-base hits -- in 2016.

4. Patrick Corbin, SP, Arizona Diamondbacks

He's one of the key starters in the league, lining up behind Zack Greinke and Shelby Miller in the Arizona rotation. If he has a strong season, the D-backs rotation will have an ace and depth. Corbin was an All-Star back in 2013 in his first full season in the majors, posting a 3.41 ERA in 208.1 innings with good peripherals. He missed all of 2014 with Tommy John surgery but returned in 2015 to make 16 starts with a 3.60 ERA. He was throwing 92-93 again, with a four-pitch repertoire (four-seamer, sinker, slider, changeup). He keeps the ball down in the zone, he knows how to pitch and the D-backs should be able to unleash him for 200 innings again.

5. Carter Capps, reliever, Miami Marlins

It's not just because he's going to get the opportunity in spring training to unseat A.J. Ramos for the closer role, although that will certainly help his value in fantasy circles. It's because his partial season last year was one of the most dominant bullpen stretches we've ever seen: 58 strikeouts, seven walks and 18 hits in 31 innings. He throws 99 and it looks like 101 because of his somehow-legal hop off the rubber. He's a key reason the Marlins have a bullpen that could emerge as one of the best in the NL.

Update: A report today from Marlins camp says Capps will undergo an MRI on his elbow. Considering he missed the end of last season with a sore elbow, this is obviously a bad sign. You have to wonder if his unusual delivery has contributed to his health problems.

6. Yasiel Puig, RF, Los Angeles Dodgers

Going with my gut here.

7. Joe Panik, 2B, San Francisco Giants

This is more confirmation that I'm buying his 2015 breakout, although he only played four games after July because of lower back inflammation. Sure, you always worry about back issues, but assuming good health Panik is a guy who might contend for the batting title this year. He hit .318 against righties, .291 against lefties, added some power from his rookie season and doesn't strike out much.

8. Stephen Strasburg, RHP, Washington Nationals

Maybe this is obvious. Or maybe it isn't. Hard to believe he'll already be a free agent after the season; seems like yesterday we watched that scintillating major league debut in 2010 when he struck out 14 Pirates in seven innings. Remember: He led the NL in strikeouts in 2014; and after those early issues with his neck landed him on the DL, over his final 13 starts he put up these Cy Young-like numbers: 82 IP, 51 H, 12 BB, 110 SO, 1.76 ERA. He's going to have a monster season and then sign a monster contract.

9. Eugenio Suarez, 3B, Cincinnati Reds

With the trade of Todd Frazier and the return of Zack Cozart, he's slated to play third base this season. I've always liked his swing and think there is a little more power to come after he hit 13 home runs in 372 at-bats last year at age 23. The thing I don't like: He drew just 17 walks. But he had decent plate discipline in the minors, so if he can cut down on the over-aggressiveness, he can improve on his .280/.315/.446 line from 2015.

10. Kris Bryant, 3B, Chicago Cubs

OK, we know he's good. I mean, the dude won Rookie of the Year honors and finished 11th in the MVP voting while ranking eighth among NL position players with 5.9 WAR. But he's not going to have a sophomore slump; he's going to get better. Despite the big numbers there are still a lot of areas for improvement, starting with cutting down on his strikeouts (he had the third-highest K rate in the majors among regulars). He also had a big home/road platoon split, with 21 of his 26 home runs coming at Wrigley Field. Maybe you want to use those numbers to call him overrated. But I'm going to cite his final two months as evidence that he's going to grow into his power: .323/.400/.567. Oh, he's a pretty good defender and can run the bases. Don't be surprised if he's the 2016 NL MVP.",[]
espn.com,,Analyzing DraftKings salaries for Valspar Championship,"['Dan Graziano', 'Chris Forsberg', 'Wayne Drehs', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Bill Barnwell', 'Eric Williams', 'Royce Young', 'Jeff Goodman', 'Zach Turcotte', 'Espn Com']","Insider

After another exciting weekend where the stars of the PGA Tour took turns vying for a WGC Championship on Sunday, Adam Scott emerged victorious for the second week in a row and looks poised for a big season. As the tour heads to Innisbrook Resort (Copperhead) this week, there is a severe drop off in the level of talent in the field. Only 19 players from Doral are in the field this week, meaning that there are not any changes to look at in the lowest salary range for the week. Every player who was in the field a week ago received at least a nominal raise, with some players shooting up substantially based upon their strong performance over the weekend. However, most of the salary increases this week have little to do with performance and much more to do with a softer overall field.

The field is obviously much different from last week, which should lead to a shift in strategy this week. Much up the upper tier enters the week with question marks either due to recent inconsistency or newfound success, and owners will need to determine whether recent performance represents a new trend for a player or can be classified as an outlier. Much of the value this week can be found in the $8,000-9,800 range, where there are a group of players with strong historical records on the course as well as good form to back them. Once you arrive in the $6,000-8,000 range, you will face a dilemma encountered in previous weeks: What to make of a soft field, as many of those players seem to have high potential but will be far less predictable in terms of figuring out who will get through the cut and who will detonate your lineup.

In situations where cut predictability is difficult to determine below the top-level players in an event, it usually makes sense to get as many dependable players as possible into your lineups, even if that means having to drop below $6,000 for the final roster spot. For cash games this week, getting five of six players through the cut will almost certainly guarantee a victory. For GPP events, I anticipate another week where a lot of high-quality players miss the cut, making a six-for-six lineup (to make the cut) tough to come by.",[]

The Major League Baseball regular season is already a six-month, 162-game grind, complete with teams playing all but a few days per month and the only discernible time off during the season coming from the All-Star break -- at least for those who aren't All-Stars.

So if the regular season is already a day-after-day grind, why is spring training so long? Fans full of anticipation want to get the real games going, and even now, still fairly early in March, pitchers have been in camp for almost three weeks, with another three to go.

So what's the ideal length of spring training? As you would expect, it all depends on who you're asking and his role on the team. I discovered that quickly as I made my way around the various spring facilities here in Arizona. Let's hear what everyone from reporters to managers to hitters to starting pitchers to relief pitchers had to say about spring training length.

Non-players

""It's too long,"" groaned C. Trent Rosecrans, Reds beat writer for the Cincinnati Enquirer. Rosecrans, like many other beat writers who have been here since mid-February, has been counting the moments until he gets some time off. Because spring training is so long, most media outlets send their writers in shifts, with the first shift usually ending right about now and replacements flying in from all over the country.

But big league managers don't have that luxury; there are no backups coming to relieve them. The grind has just begun.

The role of the manager in the spring, ostensibly, is to act as a figurehead in terms of leading practice and games, and to evaluate players for roles on the roster. Cubs manager Joe Maddon embraces the former responsibilities, but admits the second can be tricky.

But before delving into that, he passed along an observation, one that he has shared with reporters a few times already this spring: ""Players have made spring training longer. They report sooner, they want to be here sooner, and you don't blame guys for getting here sooner,"" Maddon said as he gestured to a practice behind him that he helped put together. A guitarist was finishing up a live rendition of AC/DC's ""Highway to Hell"" as a DJ took over while the players chatted in the warm Arizona air. That's not a bad setting.

""They report sooner, they want to be here sooner, and you don't blame guys for getting here sooner."" Cubs manager Joe Maddon

And what about evaluating the position battles? ""You pretty much know what your team is supposed to look like when you come into camp, and I'm a big believer in that,"" Maddon said. ""You have to rely on previous years' results regarding players; don't be fooled by a guy that hasn't done a whole lot who has a great spring, and don't be fooled by the guy who has had great success but has had a bad spring.""

His final verdict: ""The length of spring training is absolutely appropriate.""

Hitters

When a previously injured hitter heads out for a rehab assignment in the middle of the regular season to get his timing back, he usually needs only about two weeks. As such, you'd think most hitters would feel six weeks was way too long for spring training, but it's not that cut and dried.",[]

Ed Mulholland for ESPN UFC women's bantamweight champion Holly Holm (black trunks) and challenger Miesha Tate (white trunks) during their UFC 196 co-feature bout at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

Need to catch up with what's happening in the world of sports and pop culture? Don't worry, I got you.

1. Biggest upset of the weekend: Miesha Tate over Holly Holm, Nate Diaz over Conor McGregor or the Los Angeles Lakers over the Golden State Warriors?

2. Since Ronda Rousey is 2-0 against new bantamweight champion Tate, should we assume Rousey will easily reclaim the title?

3. Or, will we get Tate vs. Holm II before Rousey even makes her return to the cage?

4. As for cocky McGregor, I'll simply ask: Is this the best use of the crying Jordan meme so far this year? I think it is, lol.

5. In addition to the upsets, the top two fight cards of the night both ended in submissions. Could things have gone any better for UFC? No sport or athlete -- yes, NFL and Steph Curry included -- brings the drama or shock value quite like UFC.

6. UFC has so much, who would've thought Peyton Manning announcing his retirement wouldn't be the biggest story of the weekend? Or, at least it wasn't for me.

7. However, now that Manning is officially retiring, will he be able to ride quietly off into the sunset without the continuing buzz of his sexual assault allegations eventually tainting his legacy?

8. Another Manning question for you, does his retirement mean we've seen the end of Nationwide and Papa John's ads? Because that I could totally get behind.

9. ESPN's Chris Mortensen, who is battling throat cancer, broke Manning's retirement story. Did you see the heartwarming flood of congratulations on the scoop from Mortensen's colleagues (and competitors) and NFL fans?

10. Speaking of retirement announcements, Maria Sharapova, 28, is scheduled to make a ""major announcement"" today. She's gotta be retiring, right?

11. Before there was Craig Sager and his colorful suits, who could forget tennis Hall of Famer and journalist Bud Collins and his fancy pants? He passed away over the weekend at the age of 86. There's no doubt that he was one-of-a-kind, like many of his outfits. He will certainly be missed.

12. Former Team USA soccer player Brandi Chastain has agreed to donate her brain to CTE research. We already know females are more concussed than males, but how does gender impact the long-term effects? That is what Chastain's courageous contribution to the study will help determine, and that's a powerful thing.

13. In other concussion news, all Ivy League football teams have agreed to eliminate tackling in practice to reduce the chances of players suffering concussions. But doesn't a lack of preparation for game day make these players vulnerable to other on-field injuries?

14. NASCAR chairman and CEO Brian France faced criticism for publicly endorsing Republican candidate, Donald Trump. ESPN's Cari Champion and Jemele Hill discuss the dangerous intersection between sports and politics. Where do you stand on this issue?

15. Deflategate: Why is this still a thing? As a New York Jets fan, all I care about is whether or not Tom Brady will serve a four-game suspension. Otherwise, let it go already.

16. LeBron James training with BFF-former teammate-current Miami Heat rival Dwyane Wade created quite a stir. Then he further trolled everyone by practicing in his old Heat No. 6. And now this. Is this all a cry for help, sort of like a mid-career crisis?

17. Fun sports fact of the day: Much like the Golden State Warriors, the 72-10 Chicago Bulls of 1995-96 were also blown out in their 61st game of the season. They suffered a 32-point loss to Patrick Ewing and the New York Knicks. Sigh ... what we Knicks fans wouldn't give up to get back those glory days?

18. After exchanging words with a fan, admitting that his peers' success gets to him at times, and bricking a potential game-winning three-pointer against the Boston Celtics, Carmelo Anthony has seemed to reach his breaking point. So I've gotta ask, does Melo stay or does he go this offseason?

19. New York Yankees relief pitcher Aroldis Chapman will start the season serving a 30-game suspension for the alleged role he played in a domestic violence dispute involving his ex-girlfriend. It's the MLB's first high-profile domestic violence suspension. Did they get this right?

20. Have you started cramming for March Madness, yet? Get ready, it's right around the corner!

(0:47)

LOS ANGELES -- Nothing is ever the same in a sport after one of its biggest superstars fails a doping test. It's easy to write off lower-level busts as the fruit of envy, desperation and the climb to the top. Doubt cast on a champion makes competitors and fans alike challenge their own loyalties and assumptions.

For many years, tennis' feeble anti-doping program and self-serving assertions that it was above such base behavior helped fuel unproven rumors of secret suspensions and positive tests swept under the rug. As evidence mounted that doping crosses all sporting, national and socio-economic boundaries, tennis remained free of major drug scandals, catching only the smallest baitfish in its flawed net.

Testing has improved over the past few seasons, and higher-profile players such as 2014 U.S. Open winner Marin Cilic and Serbia's Viktor Troicki have served suspensions.

Maria Sharapova's admission almost certainly rules out any chance that she'll be let off the hook. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images

But Maria Sharapova is on a different level. The Russian is one of 10 women to have won all four Grand Slam events. She has been the highest-earning female athlete in the world for 11 straight years, according to the list kept by Forbes. Deplored for grunting, admired for pugilism, she stoically contests every point, even when a match looks lost.

It was characteristic of that persona that a cornered Sharapova would charge the ball instead of waiting at the baseline. She broke her own news rather than silently sidelining herself while the arbitration process plays out. She took responsibility for ignoring the latest revisions to the World Anti-Doping Agency's prohibited list, part of a set of rules that exists ostensibly to protect the rights and interests of athletes like her.

Her admission almost certainly rules out any chance that she'll be let off the hook. The standard of strict liability remains a core concept of the WADA code. Failure to read the fine print is essentially a breach of contract. Of course, Sharapova is wealthy and smart enough to pay a posse of people to read those regulations for her. It's almost inconceivable that no one in her entourage backed her up on the play. But she blamed no one else.

Sharapova is the seventh known athlete to test positive for Meldonium (also known as Mildronate) in the scant 10 weeks since it was added to the list of prohibited substances. The drug, developed in Latvia for use in patients with various cardiac ailments, is not approved for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration.

Research has shown that the drug's metabolism-boosting mechanism can improve endurance and aerobic capacity. The decision to ban it came after a year of monitoring by WADA, which found it cropping up in too many lab samples for comfort, as well as anecdotal and self-reported use by athletes. The recent positives have come in a variety of sports -- figure skating, cycling, biathlon, running and now tennis -- but most of the athletes who have been caught are from Russia and Eastern Europe.

There will be a time and place for Sharapova to present medical records to back her assertion that she took the drug for a decade solely for legitimate therapeutic purposes. Until and unless that explanation is forthcoming and convincing, other factors are fair game in evaluating her case.

The history of modern doping is replete with examples of drugs whose original, altruistic purpose has been twisted by athletes, coaches and sports-science gurus seeking an edge. Recovery and maintenance of form, not swift and spectacular physiological changes, are the goal of most illicit performance-enhancing regimes these days. We have all seen overly convenient diagnoses of asthma and thyroid malfunction and attention deficit disorder used as justifications.

And there's this: Sharapova may be a longtime resident of the United States, but she competes for a country whose sports-science infrastructure is completely compromised.

Tennis has been absurdly portrayed by some advocates as a sport in which endurance-enhancing drugs would not help. This despite the visible evidence that it is more physical and punishing than ever before, both on the court and between tournaments over a season that lasts 10 months and requires continual inter-continental travel.

It has always defied belief that one population of elite athletes would be significantly more ethical and less prone to cheating than another. Tennis skated under the radar for a long time, benefiting from its genteel roots and etiquette and true-believer following, even as prize money and endorsement income potential soared, and with them, the temptation to cheat.

None of this means Maria Sharapova is guilty of anything other than following a doctor's orders or being careless about reading WADA emails. Some will be quick to convict her based on our common and increasingly cynical frame of reference. Some will hurry to give her the benefit of the doubt. Neither of those conclusions is warranted yet. What is sure is that tennis is about to be tested in a greater sense.",[]

Both the FiveThirtyEight polls-plus and polls-only forecast gave Clinton a greater than 99 percent chance of winning. Thats because polling averages for primaries, while inexact, are usually not 25 percentage points off. Indeed, my colleague Nate Silver went back and found that only one primary, the 1984 Democratic primary in New Hampshire, was even on the same scale as this upset. In that contest, the polling average had Walter Mondale beating Gary Hart by 17 percentage points, but it was Hart who won, with slightly more than 9 percentage points over Mondale.

Indeed, my initial thought was to compare the Sanders upset with Clintons over Barack Obama in the 2008 New Hampshire Democratic primary, but that undersells what happened Tuesday night. I was in New Hampshire when Clinton won in 2008 and sat in stunned disbelief  Obama lost by about 3 percentage points, when the polling average had him ahead by 8 percentage points. In other words, tonights error was more than double what occurred eight years ago.

The question I am asking myself now is whether this means the polls are off in other Midwestern states that are holding open primaries. Im talking specifically about Illinois and Ohio, both of which vote next Tuesday. The FiveThirtyEight polling average in Illinois gives Clinton a 37 percentage point lead, while the average in Ohio gives her a 20 percentage point lead. If Michigan was just a fluke (which is possible), then tonight will be forgotten soon enough. If, however, pollsters are missing something more fundamental about the electorate, then the Ohio and Illinois primaries could be a lot closer than expected.

Either way, this result will send a shock wave through the press. Heck, Im a member of the press, and you might be able to tell how surprised I am. This will likely lead to increased news coverage of the Democratic race, which Sanders desperately needs in order to be competitive next Tuesday and beyond.

Sanders must rack up big wins, and fast. Thanks to an 83 percent to 16 percent win in Mississippi, Clinton gained in the overall delegate count on Tuesday and leads Sanders by more than 200 pledged delegates. Her strong performance in Mississippi also put Sanders further behind his FiveThirtyEight delegate targets. That may not be as sexy as the tremendous upset in Michigan, but math is rarely sexy.

Sanders, however, can breathe a deep sigh of relief that all the states in the Deep South have already voted. He can hope that tonights Michigan win will help propel him to victory or at least make him more competitive in states with large delegate prizes left, like California, Florida, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Well see if it does.

espn.com,,Lucky breaks fall Adam Scott's way in victory at WGC-Cadillac Championship,"['Gordon Simpson', 'Pa Sport', 'Espn Staff', 'Jason Sobel', 'Bob Harig', 'Michael Collins']","DORAL, Fla. -- Adam Scott must be paying off the karma police. He has to be praying to the golf gods.

How else can we explain his past two weeks?

At the Honda Classic, he posted a quadruple-bogey in the third round to ostensibly shoot himself out of the tournament, only to win the next day, becoming the first player in more than a half-decade to triumph with a quad on his card.

That was nothing, though, compared with this Sunday.

In the final round of the WGC-Cadillac Championship, Scott twice hit shots into awaiting water hazards, resulting in double-bogey each time. He shanked a greenside bunker attempt. He came within a few feet of hitting his approach shot on the final hole into another water hazard, instead watching as it nestled down safely in the rough.

And once again, he won the golf tournament.

""Those things even out over a long period of time,"" he said with a knowing smile.

Scott admits he's a believer in karma and golf gods and whatever other mystical superstitions afflict anyone who plays the game. He understands it's better to be good than lucky, but knows it usually takes a little luck to prevail, too.

Editor's Picks Scott rallies at Cadillac for second straight win Adam Scott made four birdies in his first five holes on the back nine at Doral to help him win the WGC-Cadillac Championship.

But this much luck? All in one day? The man must be helping little old ladies cross the street. He must be rescuing kittens from trees in his spare time.

Let's review his entire round at Trump National Doral's TPC Blue Monster course on Sunday.

Scott entered the final stanza in a share of second place, trailing by 3 strokes to Rory McIlroy. He birdied the par-5 opening hole, but promptly doubled the third and the fifth. When he reached the sixth tee, he was losing by a half-dozen shots and was pretty much the only person on-site who still thought he had a chance at the title.

""I took a moment to myself on the sixth,"" he later recalled. ""Figured there were chances downwind a little bit the next few holes that if I could get two birdies by the turn, then not too much damage is done.""

That's exactly what he did, posting birdies on two of the next three. Then he stepped on the gas pedal. Another birdie on 10. And again on 11, and 12, and 14.

Scott stormed into the lead, but remember -- this is a guy who knows these things have a way of evening out.

After hitting his tee shot into a greenside bunker on the driveable par-4 16th hole, he hit a shot that can only be described as a shank. A hosel rocket. A gaffe even an 18-handicapper would regret. The ball scooted dead right, almost landing in another nearby bunker.

Scott, in perhaps the most Adam Scott-ish display of behavior ever, reacted to the mishit by apologizing to his caddie.

""I was so embarrassed to do that playing with Phil Mickelson,"" he laughed. ""I mean, he would be lipping it out or holing it, and I'm shanking it nearly into the next bunker. It shocked me a bit. I just tried to be too fancy and probably showing off in front of Phil a little bit. I wish I could tell you I had a bad lie or it was a hard shot. It wasn't any of it. It was just a complete error.""

This is the type of error that would unravel a player, the type that would get inside his head and keep him from refocusing on the task at hand. Scott simply hit the next shot close and holed the putt for a par that was anything but routine.

He wasn't done, either.

Needing another par on the treacherous closing hole, he drove his ball into the right rough, just behind a skinny tree. He attempted to play a cut shot toward the green, but it stayed left. The ball appeared targeted for the awaiting water -- a third during his round to find a watery grave -- but instead clung to the rough inside the hazard line.

""I hit it right where I aimed it,"" he explained. ""I had to aim left and the wind just wasn't really moving it. Maybe it was too low, but I hit it really solid. I wasn't surprised it carried. But I was surprised it stayed up in the hazard. Thank goodness for that.""

He then paused and considered the big picture. He thought about karma and golf gods and luck and everything else needed to win a golf tournament.

""When you win after something like that, that's winner's luck, really,"" he admitted. ""At some point, I would have hit that shot and it's bounced back in and you don't win, and other times it stays up and you do.""

Make no mistake: Scott had to be very good to win the tournament this week. But he also needed plenty of luck along the way.

He understands this much. He understands that sometimes the golf gods will punish a player, but these things always have a way of evening themselves out.",[]
espn.com,,Roman 'Rocky' Martinez out of defense vs. Miguel Berchelt with hand injury,"['Dan Rafael', 'Pa Sport', 'Brian Campbell', 'Nigel Collins']","Junior lightweight world titleholder Roman ""Rocky"" Martinez suffered a left hand injury and withdrew Friday from his mandatory defense against Miguel Berchelt, Puerto Rico Best Boxing Promotions announced.

Martinez, 33, of Puerto Rico, was due to travel to Berchelt's hometown of Merida, Mexico, on Monday to defend against him March 12.

According to PR Best Boxing, Martinez (29-2-3, 17 KOs) was examined by Dr. Jose M. Santiago Figueroa, who diagnosed him with tendinitis in his left hand and recommended he rest it for four weeks.

""Definitely Rocky will not fight on March 12,"" PR Best Boxing vice president Peter Rivera said. ""Rocky had a pain in the hand, and we went last week to see Dr. Santiago Figueroa, who specializes in hand injuries and is one of the best in Puerto Rico, and he prescribed some medication to Rocky. But the pain continued, and we went to see him again [Thursday]. After the evaluation, Dr. Santiago Figueroa gave him the diagnosis and advised him not to punch with that hand and rest for four weeks.

""As soon as the doctor notified us [Thursday], we talked with the people from Zanfer Promotions [Berchelt's promoter] to let them know of the situation and to work the possibility of a new date for the fight.""

Martinez said there were a number of Puerto Rican fans who had made plans to travel to Mexico for the fight, which was to have been his second title defense of his third 130-pound title reign.

""I feel bad for all Puerto Rican fans, including some people who already had tickets to go to Mexico with us, but I had to be 100 percent and I could not disappoint my country fighting there injured,"" Martinez said. ""Now I have to follow the instructions of the doctor and wait patiently until they give me the green light to train at a high level again. Everyone knows I'll be ready to return to the ring and defend my title when I recover.""

Said Rivera: ""Unexpected things happen, and fights fall through. It's better this way for Rocky, rest the hand and not punch. Let us hope that he does not have to undergo surgery. Rocky is a warrior. He wanted to go ahead with the fight but recognizes that for the sake of his career it's better to follow the doctor's recommendation. Everyone knows that Rocky does not shy away from opponents, so when it recovers, he will be ready for anyone.""

Zanfer Promotions head Fernando Beltran said he hopes to find a substitute opponent for Berchelt (28-1, 25 KOs), 24, to fight March 12.

Last month Beltran won a purse bid for $215,000 for the right to promote the fight.

""It's a very unfortunate situation,"" Beltran said. ""We, as winner of the auction, had fulfilled all that there was for us to do and had everything ready. Berchelt had an exceptional training camp for two months, and it will not be in vain.""

Beltran said he hopes that a contender in the WBO rankings will agree to the fight on short notice and that the organization will sanction it for the interim world title. If the WBO does that, the winner of the fight will have to face Martinez upon his return.",[]
espn.com,,Team Liquid and Team Secret top six remaining teams in Dota 2 Shanghai Major,"['James Obscurica', 'James Bates', 'Tomi Lurppis', 'Obscurica Chen', 'Stephen Chiu', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Timothy Lee', 'Tyler Fionn', 'Erzberger James', 'Chase Geddes']","After three days of the Dota 2 Shanghai Major main event, we're left with only six teams. Team Liquid and Team Secret are set to face off in the upper bracket finals, and Evil Geniuses, MVP Phoenix, compLexity Gaming, and Fnatic are left to fight it out in the lower bracket. Four teams that won their way in from qualifiers remain, and none of them are Chinese teams.

With such a stacked remaining field, it's anyone's guess which team should be the tournament favorite. This has been Dota 2 at its finest -- contrasting styles, a high variety of heroes, an underdog narrative and the best quality of play anywhere. Day 3 has proven the intensity that this level of competition can produce, and the finals of this major are almost certain to bring it to yet another level entirely.

Upper bracket -- Round 2

Team Liquid vs. MVP Phoenix

The worst possible matchup for tournament darling MVP Phoenix was Team Liquid. From the stellar rotating supports, JerAx and KuroKy, to the utility player, MinDContRol, Team Liquid can fight aggression with their own brand of it. Without the trump card of speed and fighting prowess, MVP Phoenix was forced to fight a ""traditional"" game of Dota, and failed in that endeavor -- which should be unsettling for fans of the Korean team.

Editor's Picks The Great Chinese Collapse of the Shanghai Major Did anyone see the Great Chinese Collapse coming? Alan ""Nahaz"" Bester takes a look at the lackluster performance of the Chinese Dota 2 squads at the Shanghai Major.

The first game ended in 17 minutes, with Team Liquid utterly outclassing MVP Phoenix in all stages of the game. From drafting, to the rotations from their two great supports, and team fights, Team Liquid checked every box on the list in their favor. It was a very fast tap-out, as nothing worked out for MVP Phoenix.

While the first game went at a lightning-fast pace, the second game was a slow crawl, full of fighting. MVP Phoenix drafted and attempted to play the longer game against Team Liquid's aggression, but it was not playing to its strengths in that strategy. Team Liquid simply played better from the earliest minutes through the end. It could have potentially ended at an equally early point to Game 1, but MVP Phoenix played just solid enough of a defense to lose at the 30-minute mark instead.

Evil Geniuses vs. Team Secret

A matchup that many considered a realistic candidate for the grand finals for the Shanghai Majors (and could still very well be, depending on the circumstances) met and exceeded all expectations. There were divine rapiers, massive team fights that extended past the commentator's limit, marathon and blitzkrieg games, and execution in all areas that make Dota 2 great.

Evil Geniuses shut down Team Secret's EternalEnvy, who was using Spectre, at the start of Game 1. EternalEnvy was nearly last in net worth, while middle laner w33 only gained levels in that middle lane and only Misery's Lone Druid was allowed to farm. Evil Geniuses built their lead through the static lane phase and superior pick-off heroes, Batrider and Sven, with lockdown in Dark Seer and Doom to take control of the early game.

The biggest factor in a comeback for Team Secret was the black hole and magnetize from Earth Spirit, as it helped them to eventually overwhelm every fight and take the map back. The biggest key in what would eventually be a Game 1 victory would be Evil Geniuses' ignorance of the Lone Druid, which allowed the key item -- radiance -- to control the game from then on.

Game 2 was a pushing battle with Evil Geniuses going all-in, while Team Secret only mimicked to avoid a team fight. Evil Geniuses snowballed with Lycan's mobility and superior structural damage to take map control, and a very quick victory to even the series.

Then, Game 3 happened, and things reached an entirely different level. In the draft, Team Secret went for high mobility and split push while Evil Geniuses prioritized team fight and an overall ball of death.

The downside to Evil Geniuses' draft? Sumail received zero support in lane, and their supports needed levels and items. Team Secret, behind w33 and Pieliedie's strong starts and rotations, took controlled neutral objectives, map vision and control, and early towers. Puppey's Nightstalker built a 20-minute Aghnamim's Scepter for the superior night vision but, because of multiple overextensions from EternalEnvy and a big Roshan pick-off of w33, Evil Geniuses brought back the game back to an even keel.

Despite the stronger defenses of Evil Geniuses, the split-push of Team Secret made every fight and trade a costly one (as a part of EternalEnvy and Misery's rat strategy). Even with EternalEnvy's best efforts to throw the game, it was eventually bad positioning from Arteezy that cost Evil Geniuses the rest of their barracks and forced the team to go for an all-in push. Arteezy led the charge but got zoned out and dropped both rapiers -- and eventually the game -- as Team Secret set a date with Team Liquid in the Upper Bracket finals.

Lower bracket -- Round 3

Alliance vs. compLexity Gaming

Though many believed this set would be an easy one for Alliance, compLexity Gaming proved that they're no pushover. They allowed Alliance their comfort picks in the draft, played the split-push game and took a couple of games into the later stages -- where they outplayed the veteran squad, and ultimately beat them. Underdogs often make for the best stories, and compLexity Gaming continues to march on in its journey in Shanghai.

Game 1 was a timing battle between compLexity Gaming's early lineup and Alliance's radiance timing. Though compLexity Gaming's early ganks were answered by Alliance's Chen rotation and Zeus damage, two big fights allowed them to control the map. Then s4 happened. Nuke after nuke and lightning bolt after clutch lightning bolt was all compLexity Gaming saw, as Alliance used two big buybacks and an aegis to crush through the base defense to take the first game.

Later, compLexity Gaming drafted an Earth Spirit to harass every lane for an early kill lead in Game 2, but the first team fight was all Alliance. Alliance would group up often, and picked off core or support alike to swing the gold lead in their favor, but one sunstrike from Chessie led to another Roshan for compLexity Gaming and a stalemate into the midgame. Alliance were forced into their split-push and kept the damage to a minimum. Finally, after a double-damage rune, compLexity Gaming forced a fight in the enemy ancients and wiped out Alliance completely (including two deaths on AdmiralBulldog) and crushed through two free barracks. From there, compLexity Gaming played it safe and went for mega creeps, forcing a Game 3.

An absolutely scorching start for compLexity Gaming, brought to them by Zfreek's roaming Mirana, punished the greedy laning configuration of Alliance. To counter the endless aggression and early fighting items of the compLexity Gaming's cores, Alliance grouped up and expended their impressive ultimates and flexed their team fighting execution to stem the bleeding. The two teams clashed multiple times in bloody fights, with neither side collecting a significant advantage.

The two big positives for compLexity Gaming were Chessie's Ember Spirit and the complete control of Roshan. Alliance's Spectre advantage showed itself once again in Game 3, with a huge buyback into haunt team wipe to push the game to an absolute halt entering the late game stage. The will to win for compLexity Gaming would not be denied, though -- their mindgames (baiting buybacks without losing anything), late-game execution (Roshan fights with a buyback Outworld Destroyer) and the absence of mercy would win them the series.

OG vs. Fnatic

What a series. Though Fnatic vs. OG was one of the most lopsided matchups on paper, the last set of the day did not disappoint. While the difference in individual skill and mechanical prowess on heroes was minimal, the overall team play and execution made all the difference for Fnatic. OG was one of the picks to go far in this tournament, and top-8 was nowhere near where they wanted to place.

But Fnatic would not be intimidated. They played long games, with strategies akin to Team Secret; objective and pick-off based, they did it all.

Some of the commentators liked the strong Fnatic draft for Game 1, but they chose to ban standard picks instead of following the playbook on how to beat OG -- prevent MoonMeander from grabbing a greedy hero, keep N0tail from a hero that doesn't require farming the middle lane, and keep high-impact/proactive support heroes out of play. Despite this potential blunder, Fnatic played to their style of prioritizing objectives and still executed a great plan to shut down the rest of OG, giving Miracle- free farm (much like how Team Secret won). The risk with giving Miracle- farm is, well, he's still Miracle-. Every big team fight came with track gold, and Miracle- finished them for OG. Fnatic took advantage of an overall gold spike to finish up the first game, despite the ridiculous threat of Miracle-.

Fnatic took the Sven for Game 2, and the pace decreased into a crawl. OG is a number of things, but a slow, passive, well-executed fight of Dota is not one of their strengths; Fnatic excel in that approach. With complete control of the late and uber-late game, OG did exactly what you'd expect it to do with their backs to the wall: They made a huge comeback. They had Fnatic pinned into their map for nearly 15 minutes, until a big fight spilled out and allowed the Southeast Asian team to even out the barrack count at two apiece near the hour mark of the game.

Finally, with one attempted push from OG, Fnatic took a huge fight in their favor with a double-ravage and a double-black king bar and warcry from Mushi's farmed Sven. But, just like the name suggests, it took a miracle to come back against Fnatic's huge 20k gold lead -- and they got it when Fly miraculously dodged the ravage pick-off from Fnatic and Miracle- cleared the entire enemy team and opened up their base. One buyback and death from Sven with a divine rapier and Game 2 was finally over.

Fnatic seemed to have short-term memories at the start of Game 3, as Ohaiyo and DJ combined to rotate and wreak havoc in the first 10 minutes of the game as Nyx and Chen, respectively. Despite Miracle- and his prowess with Anti-Mage, Fnatic punished the greedy OG draft with non-stop rotations and pick-offs courtesy of Spectre's haunt and Nyx's Assassin.

Fnatic would go on to take every outer tower before the 20-minute mark, Mushi farmed a radiance on his Spectre, MidOne had the highest net total and Ohaiyo's Nyx Assassin was one-shotting anyone not named Miracle-. This was Fnatic's game to lose. Two barracks by 28 minutes, a Chen at near 10K net worth and Miracle- continuing to stand as the only one farming well for OG helped Fnatic take firm control of the game -- and they'd ultimately end the hopes of one of the tournament favorites on their way to a huge victory.

Free-agent tracker | Notable deals | Full reaction and analysis

Olivier Vernon (Giants): B

Well, nobody can accuse the Giants of not going for it. Needing desperately to upgrade his team's pass rush, general manager Jerry Reese first re-signed Jason Pierre-Paul to a one-year deal. Once the Dolphins removed the transition tag from Vernon, the Giants were rumored to be in the running to come away with the Miami defensive end, but nobody expected the numbers to fall quite where they did. Vernon's deal is staggering: He gets five years and $85 million, with $52.5 million guaranteed and $54 million over the first three years of his deal. That's awfully close to what J.J. Watt (six years, $100 million, $52 million guaranteed) got from the Texans. Too close.

The Giants are paying Vernon as though he'll be a superstar pass-rusher over the next three years. Has he been? Depends on which number you look at. Vernon produced 25.5 sacks over his three years as a starter in Miami, including his lone double-digit-sack season in 2013, when he produced 11.5 of those 25.5 sacks. He also spent that entire run playing on a line with Cameron Wake and/or Ndamukong Suh, which should tell you how often he saw double-teams. He's getting paid like a guy who can routinely beat them now.

The more subtle number is what Vernon did last year. Despite posting a mere 7.5 sacks, Vernon knocked down the opposing quarterback 36 times, which was the third-highest total in football behind Watt (50) and Aaron Donald (37). Vernon also chipped in with 10 tackles for loss on running plays, which was tied for fifth in the league. Even with Wake out for most of the year with a torn Achilles, Vernon proved he's a playmaker, even if the sack totals don't (yet) reflect it. There's some evidence that guys with crazy amounts of quarterback hits can turn those knockdowns into future sacks, with Ezekiel Ansah and Carlos Dunlap serving as recent examples. Vernon will need to make the same sort of leap to justify this massive outlay in 2016 and beyond.

Damon Harrison (Giants): C

The Giants further upgraded their defensive line by adding a massive body on the interior. The 350-pound Harrison won't have to travel far, given that he spent his first four seasons with the Jets, but he will likely be moving into a new house. After making a total of $3.8 million during his four seasons on the green side of the Meadowlands, Harrison signed a five-year, $46-million deal with $23 million guaranteed to become an interior presence for the Giants.

Harrison was a very good player for the Jets, and his best years could still be ahead of him at 27, but there are reasons to be hesitant about this move for the Giants. Harrison was surrounded by stars during his last run, with Muhammad Wilkerson and Sheldon Richardson alongside him for the vast majority of the past three seasons. He won't exactly be surrounded by scrubs, given that the Giants spent their entire offseason allowance on defensive linemen on Tuesday, but it might make Harrison look like a more important asset than he would have been on a lesser team.

How will Damon Harrison be a three-down player for the Giants? William Hauser/USA TODAY Sports

More interestingly, Harrison is moving from playing the nose as a 3-4 tackle to likely lining up in a gap as a 4-3 tackle under Steve Spagnuolo. The Giants can still play Harrison as a two-gap tackle on the interior, but Spagnuolo has had success in the past bringing his defensive ends inside on passing downs and getting 250-pound guys to rush the passer against overmatched guards, and the league has followed suit. Harrison did play some as a one-gap tackle under Todd Bowles last year, but he had four quarterback hits and a half-sack; penetrating into the backfield isn't really his game. It just seems as though, in a 4-3, Harrison likely ends up as a two-down player in a league that's shifting more and more toward the pass. It'll be hard for him to deliver value that way.

Brock Osweiler (Texans): B+

Count me among the many who never thought we'd end up here -- with the Broncos suddenly looking down the barrel of Trevor Siemian as the No. 1 quarterback on their depth chart. But here we are. After benching Osweiler in Week 17 and failing to come to terms with their former second-round pick on a deal before free agency, the Broncos have lost the 25-year-old signal-caller to the Texans on a four-year deal worth $72 million. While we don't yet have the contract structure, Osweiler turned down $30 million guaranteed from the Broncos to get $37 million in guarantees from Houston, so it's likely that he'll have the first two years of his deal mostly guaranteed with the Texans. If Houston general manager Rick Smith had to get creative with the contract structure to fit Osweiler, Lamar Miller and new guard Jeff Allen under the cap, that would drop this grade down to a B.

When I previewed the offseason for the AFC South, I noted that Osweiler's seven professional starts were remarkably similar to incumbent Texans quarterback Brian Hoyer's first eight starts (including one ending quickly with a torn ACL). That's no less true today than it was last month. The difference, you can argue, is that Osweiler has a much higher ceiling than Hoyer did after his eight starts. Osweiler doesn't turn 26 until November, and he came into the league as a quarterback with prototypical size and arm strength and little else. Hoyer didn't have the same sort of tools.

Osweiler vs. Hoyer in 2015 QB Cmp Att Cmp% Yds Y/Att TD INT Osweiler 156 251 62.2% 1821 7.3 9 5 Hoyer 158 262 60.3% 1847 7.0 12 5

If Osweiler improved studying underneath Peyton Manning, Gary Kubiak and Adam Gase -- and continues to improve under Bill O'Brien, who has manufactured an ambulatory offense with some pretty middling quarterbacks over the past two years -- the Texans could come away with a promising quarterback without having to give up a draft pick. He's unlikely to be a bargain, but given what precious few options the Texans had, taking a two-year shot at Osweiler makes a lot of sense.

As for the Broncos, it simply appears that they weren't able to convince Osweiler that it was worth staying in Denver. You have to imagine, despite what Osweiler said publicly, that he was hurt by Kubiak's decision to bench him in favor of Manning in Week 17. The Broncos will hit the drawing board, and with plenty of cap space freed up by Manning's retirement, Denver can go after a short-term alternative like Ryan Fitzpatrick or try to buy low on Colin Kaepernick or Robert Griffin III. That doesn't sound all that promising, but remember that the Broncos just won a Super Bowl with a limited Manning under center. They may very well look back and miss Malik Jackson more than they miss Osweiler.

George Iloka (Bengals): B+

It's hard to fathom why Cincinnati got so close to letting Iloka hit the market to begin with. The Bengals rarely shop in free agency and tend to go out of their way to keep the players they want around. So it was a surprise to see a 25-year-old emerging star -- who has gotten better with each passing season -- hit the free market. The Bengals may have gotten a better deal if they locked Iloka up in February, but the price tag isn't egregious for a player with his ability, given that he's a stout run-defender who can credibly chip in against tight ends in coverage. Iloka's five-year, $30-million deal fully guarantees just $5 million and keeps his base salary under $5 million for the entirety of his deal. It's a quietly effective deal for a team that does more right than its reputation suggests.

Brandon Brooks (Eagles): B+

At this point, Howie Roseman is really just trying to reverse what Chip Kelly did last offseason. After Kelly let starting guards Evan Mathis and Todd Herremans go and replaced them with, well, nobody, Philadelphia's offense crashed to a halt. There were other factors, of course, and the Eagles' offense may continue to struggle under new head coach Doug Pederson in 2016, but it won't be for lack of expensive guards! Brooks comes over from the Texans on a five-year, $40-million deal, using much of the cap space freed up by the trades of Byron Maxwell and DeMarco Murray. It's a valuable signing at a position of significant need for Philly.

Regardless of where Brooks ends up, he'll be part of one of the more freakishly athletic guard-tackle tandems in football, given that he'll be lining up next to either Lane Johnson or Jason Peters. Brooks was effective in a zone scheme under Gary Kubiak in 2013, and he has only gotten better with Bill O'Brien mixing his run-blocking up a little more regularly over the past two seasons. At 343 pounds, he isn't exactly the sort of undersized lineman who might struggle to play in a more traditional scheme, and his signing may be a hint that the Eagles might try to run more power concepts under Pederson in 2016.

Chase Daniel (Eagles): C+

Expensive square peg in square hole is simple enough. Daniel's signing may end up as far less important than Brooks' in the long run, but it's more interesting to talk about. It seemed like the Eagles were moving on from their reported interest in Daniel after they re-signed Sam Bradford last week, but the $22 million Philly guaranteed to Bradford didn't dissuade them from bringing in Pederson's former backup quarterback in Kansas City. Daniel received a three-year, $21-million deal with $12 million fully guaranteed to follow Pederson to the City of Brotherly Love.

Daniel is getting paid more than your typical backup quarterback -- even your upper-echelon backups like Mark Sanchez are usually getting no more than $6 million per year, with just one year fully guaranteed. (In related news, expect Sanchez, now a third-stringer, to be cut in the near future.) That's a hint as to how Pederson and the Eagles value Daniel. While we don't know the specific structure of Daniel's deal, the length, the guarantee and the incentives (which would make the deal worth up to $36 million) all suggest that the Eagles wanted to add some built-in value if Daniel does emerge as the starter. (Daniel's last deal in Kansas City voided if he received regular playing time.) It's likely that the Eagles will begin the season with Bradford as their starter, but they're preparing for an injury or a disappointing performance with a higher-upside option than Sanchez. We still have no idea if Daniel is any good, which is why this grade isn't higher, but it's a fascinatingly aggressive move by a front office that is having a very sound week.

Lamar Miller (Texans): B+

Houston gave its new quarterback a top running back, too, by signing Miller to a four-year deal worth $26 million with $14 million guaranteed. As was the case with Osweiler, this seems to make sense as a deal with two guaranteed seasons and a small buyout thereafter if the Texans want to move on. That would allow Miller to hit free agency again at 28 if he breaks out with the Texans -- a move that will be tougher, given that Houston's lost a pair of starting offensive linemen in Brandon Brooks and Ben Jones. It did bring in Jeff Allen from the Chiefs on a four-year, $28-million deal, but Allen isn't regarded as being in Brooks' class as a guard.

Miller remains one of the more fascinating backs in the league by virtue of how the Dolphins seemed to flirt with making him their primary offensive weapon before abandoning the move inexplicably the following week. There are worse things you can do in life than fail to be Miami's cup of tea, but it's also tough to project Miller to be a 300-carry back until we've actually seen him do it. Then again, it's hard to find a skill Miller doesn't have. He doesn't fumble at any sort of crazy rate. He can catch the ball out of the backfield. He can break big gains. He's been a perfectly reasonable goal-line back, scoring on 42 percent of his touches inside the 5-yard line (the league average is 40 percent).

He hasn't had serious injury concerns as a pro, in part assuredly because the Dolphins haven't overworked him, but you'd rather bet on Miller keeping this up over a larger workload than you would on Doug Martin or Chris Ivory at similar price tags. It's always a dangerous game to place any faith in a running back being paid market value, but Miller is one of the few guys with upside to burn over what he'll be paid.

Doug Martin (Buccaneers): D+

One year ago, the Buccaneers were so disinterested in Doug Martin that they passed on giving him a fifth-year option which would have been worth $5.6 million. That option was only guaranteed for injury, meaning that the Buccaneers would only have been on the hook if Martin suffered a serious injury which impacted his ability to play. Now, a year later, the Bucs find the idea of keeping Martin around compelling enough to give him a five-year, $35.8 million deal with $15 million guaranteed, one of the bigger contracts in football for a running back.

Admittedly, Martin had an excellent 2015 season, and what the Bucs didn't do before the 2015 season shouldn't necessarily impact their decision-making afterward. The fact that their valuation changed so significantly, though, speaks to just how reactive the Buccaneers are organizationally and what little faith they have in their ability to evaluate their own roster. If the Bucs really believed Martin was this good, they would have picked up his option last year and used it as leverage to negotiate a long-term deal. They're paying for the player Martin was in 2015, and that's almost always a mistake when it comes to running backs.

Taken into context with the rest of his career, Martin just hasn't been a $7 million-per-year running back. He averaged 4.9 yards per carry during a resurgent 2015, but that was driven by a series of long runs. He had four runs of 45 yards or more last season (more than anybody beside Todd Gurley) after posting just five such runs over his first three seasons combined. Injuries also kept Martin alternately sidelined and ineffective for most of 2013 and 2014. If Martin stays healthy and continues to break long runs at a league-leading pace, he'll be worth the money. The chances of that happening just aren't very high.

Alex Mack (Falcons): B

Having struggled to replace longtime center Todd McClure since the 13-year veteran retired after 2012, Atlanta went to the very top of the market and came away with the best center available. Mack excelled during his brief stint under current Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan in Cleveland, which lasted only five games in 2014 before Mack went down with a season-ending fractured fibula. (Browns fans once noted that Cleveland averaged 26.8 points per game before Mack's injury and 15 points per game afterward as a way to regain hope about the 2015 season, but that didn't last.)

Peter King reports that Mack's five-year deal will average $9.5 million per season, which will keep Mack among the highest-paid centers in football. You could argue that it's a little dangerous to pay that much for a 30-year-old offensive lineman one year removed from a serious lower leg injury, but centers seem to last longer than linemen at other positions. Jeff Saturday, playing in a zone scheme, was effective into his late 30s as a member of the Colts. The Falcons are still built upon a wildly high-variance stars-and-scrubs strategy, and they'll need Mack to stay healthy, but this should give them a massive upgrade at what has been a point of weakness for several years.

Titans acquire DeMarco Murray, Eagles' fourth-round pick; Eagles acquire Titans' fourth-round pick

Titans: C+

Eagles: B+

This is essentially a contract dump. It's unclear exactly where those picks will fall until the league announces its compensatory selections for 2016, but the typical 13-pick swing in the fourth round is worth about a high seventh-round pick, so the Eagles aren't getting a ton out of this deal in terms of draft compensation. Instead, they gain salary relief; they'll eat $4 million in dead money this year and save $9 million in money that was previously guaranteed to Murray, including $7 million in 2016 and $2 million in 2017. Philly will likely now keep Ryan Mathews, who could serve as the team's primary back after outperforming Murray last season.

For the Titans, it's a defensible move, but not necessarily a wise one. It's hard to see how adding another expensive running back to their books after years of striking out on spending at the position makes a lot of sense. And while it's unfair to blame new general manager Jon Robinson for the mistakes of the past, he spent the bulk of his scouting career in New England, where Bill Belichick has virtually never devoted serious assets to running backs and been happy with the outcome. (The trade for Corey Dillon worked, but the subsequent contract extension Dillon signed was a mess, and the Patriots wouldn't mind taking back the first-round pick they used on Laurence Maroney.) The Titans aren't one running back away from contention, so why devote money to a veteran back like Murray?

Murray's deal has been restructured in a way that provides a little more upside for the Titans, but even that's odd, given that the one thing they really had to burn in 2016 is cap space. If Tennessee had stuck with Murray's old deal, they could have gone year-to-year without incurring any dead cap figures if they wanted to move on from the former Cowboys star. Now, having guaranteed Murray an additional $3.25 million next year, the Titans will have to hope Murray shows more in 2016 than he did during his disastrous 2015. (To be fair, given that Murray's agent and the Eagles were both looking for a trade destination, Murray may very well have insisted on additional guaranteed money to head to Tennessee.)

The upside is that Murray should be far more productive in Tennessee than he was during his short stint in Philadelphia. Mike Mularkey has a track record of relying on a bell-cow back, going back to his days with Willis McGahee in Buffalo, and if Murray can stay healthy, the Titans should be able to generate a far more effective running game than they had with Antonio Andrews and David Cobb pencilled in as the starters. The opportunity cost of not finding a cheap option (or spending the money used on Murray elsewhere) hurts, but you can understand why Robinson would want to take a swing at a guy who looked like an MVP candidate as recently as 2014.

Marvin Jones (Lions): C

By virtue of the fact that he's replacing a future Hall of Famer, Jones is already up against unfair expectations in Detroit. It's not reasonable to expect Jones to match -- or even come close to matching -- Calvin Johnson. Let's get that out of the way before we evaluate this decision.

With that said, it's awful tough to see Jones being worth $8 million per year. The track record of No. 2 wideouts playing behind star receivers moving into larger roles isn't very impressive, and while the Lions were able to get more out of Golden Tate after bringing him over from Seattle, Jones was really option 2B in Cincinnati's offense. He was thrown the ball on just 20.4 percent of the routes he ran last year, which was tied with Tyler Eifert for 80th in the league. (Tate was just ahead of him, at 20.6 percent. Megatron was at 22.8 percent.)

At the same time, there's not really much the Lions could have done. This is a distressingly thin market for wide receivers, and while they could have hoped for more development from Eric Ebron and drafted a wideout, the next veteran up on their roster at wide receiver was Corey Fuller. This probably isn't going to be a good deal, and the Lions really needed to use their cap space on improving their offensive and defensive lines, but they had to make some kind of move at receiver.

Dolphins acquire Byron Maxwell, Kiko Alonso and the 13th overall pick of the NFL draft; Eagles acquire No. 8 overall pick

Dolphins: C-

Eagles: B+

Jumping from No. 13 to No. 8 in the first round sounds like a more meaningful improvement than it's likely to be in reality. Chase Stuart's empirical draft value model suggests that that five-pick leap is roughly equivalent to the 140th pick in a typical draft. In other words, this move amounts to a selection at the top of the fifth round. That's not going to shift the needle dramatically for Philadelphia's draft capital, although it helps, given that the Eagles are down a second-rounder this year thanks to the Sam Bradford trade.

It's shocking, though, that the Eagles were able to get anything in a swap for Maxwell's onerous contract. Philly eats $4.8 million in dead money on its 2016 cap, but the Eagles will save $8.5 million on their 2016 cap and will have the dead money off their cap for 2017 and beyond. The Dolphins will likely restructure Maxwell's $8.5 million base salary as a signing bonus to create more cap space and sign more free agents -- as is their wont -- but there's still little upside on this deal. Maxwell was erratic at best in his first year outside of the Seattle cocoon, and at $10 million per year going forward, he'll need to play like a No. 1 cornerback to justify his salary, even with the rising tide of cornerback contracts.

Oddly, the Dolphins may get more out of Alonso, who will likely move back to play middle linebacker in a 4-3 after getting lost in Philly's 3-4 look. With one year remaining on Alonso's rookie deal, he offers the best chance of generating surplus value in this deal for Miami.

Travis Benjamin (Chargers): C-

Reports suggest the Chargers are giving Benjamin more than $6 million per year, which seems like an aggressive valuation for a guy who only really has one season of NFL competence on his resume. You can make the fair argument Benjamin would look a lot better with Philip Rivers throwing him passes than the assorted flotsam the Browns have rolled out at quarterback over his four years in Cleveland, but Benjamin was a mess at wideout during his first three seasons in the league, catching just 41 of the 96 passes thrown to him for a brutal 42.7 percent catch rate. Even for a downfield weapon, that's bad. He got up to 54.4 percent on his 125 targets last year, but much of that came on screens and shorter passes. Benjamin caught 47.2 percent of the passes thrown to him traveling 8 or more yards in the air, still comfortably below the league average of 52.8 percent.

Benjamin will likely take over the Malcom Floyd role in San Diego's offense, and while it makes sense to see the Chargers target a veteran to fill that spot, this is a lot of money for a receiver who may very well be fifth in line for targets behind Keenan Allen, Antonio Gates, Stevie Johnson and Danny Woodhead. Benjamin has enough upside to make the deal comprehensible from San Diego's perspective, but this is money the Chargers really needed to throw at their offensive line or 28th-ranked defense. Benjamin does add value as a punt returner, where the Chargers struggled mightily last year, but solid returners come a lot cheaper than this.

Ben Jones (Titans): B+

The Titans found reasonable value in signing away an interior lineman from a division rival. Jones started at both guard and center during his four years with the Texans, moving to the pivot after Houston moved on from long-time starter Chris Myers last season. The Titans are likely set at guard with Chance Warmack and Jeremiah Poutasi, but center Brian Schwenke hasn't been able to stay healthy and is coming off of a dislocated ankle last year. Tennessee only had to guarantee $7.5 million to bring Jones over, which means they can get out of the deal after two years if need be. Given that Alex Mack is looking at something in the $10 million-per-year range, that's a very friendly deal for new Titans general manager Jon Robinson.

Jason Pierre-Paul (Giants): B+

The Giants badly need some semblance of a pass rush, having finished with just 21 sacks last season, the second-fewest in all of football. It seems odd to suggest that bringing back a player who was part of that 21-sack haul would be a good idea, but there are obvious fireworks-related arguments surrounding JPP's lack of production in 2015. He finished with one sack in eight games during an abbreviated season, but it's reasonable to expect more out of Pierre-Paul in 2016 a year further removed from his accident. More than anything, though, the price is right; the Giants couldn't realistically commit to JPP on a long-term deal, and they saved about $5 million versus what it would have cost to slap Pierre-Paul with the franchise tag. That's a victory.

Janoris Jenkins (Giants): C+

Giants general manager Jerry Reese has spent the last two offseasons going after veterans in the middle of the market, but the tactic hasn't helped. Reese hit on Robert Ayers (now a free agent), while the likes of J.T. Thomas, J.D. Walton, and Jonathan Casillas did little to push the Giants forward. The one exception Reese has made to that strategy over the last couple of years was to sign Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie, and he has added a second high-priced cornerback by signing Jenkins away from the Rams on a deal worth more than $12 million per year.

Are we sure Janoris Jenkins is really a top CB? AP Photo/Billy Hurst

Jenkins will be paid like a top cornerback, but he wasn't really that guy in St. Louis. He's been a DeAngelo Hall-type corner, an athletic ballhawk who will look like a superstar the weeks he guesses right and a liability the weeks he doesn't. It's no coincidence that both Jenkins and Trumaine Johnson suddenly looked more effective in 2014 and 2015, given that they were playing behind arguably the league's most terrifying pass rush. The average pass against the Rams last year came 2.31 seconds after the quarterback took the snap, which was the quickest time in the league. Against the Giants, the average pass came 2.58 seconds after the snap, which was the fifth-longest time in football. That doesn't sound like a big difference, but over 600 pass attempts, it's nearly a 12 percent increase in the amount of time Jenkins would have to spend in coverage downfield. That's a big risk.

Dwayne Allen (Colts): B

Allen has been a frustrating figure during his four years in Indy. When healthy, he has been a plus blocker and a competent receiver, and the list of tight ends in the NFL who are average-or-better at both those things really doesn't go very long. His totals aren't especially impressive, but Indy's leveraged him as a blocker while using fellow free agent Coby Fleener as their primary receiving tight end. The issue has been staying on the field; Allen has missed 21 of Indy's last 48 games with various maladies, most recently a calf ailment which cost him three games in 2015.

Under that microscope, Allen's four-year, $29.4-million deal looks like an overpay at first. Allen will have a $8.9 million cap hit in 2016, the second-highest figure for a tight end in football behind Jimmy Graham. The structure of the deal, though, makes a lot of sense for Indy. With Andrew Luck coming due for an even bigger raise in 2017, it's logical for Ryan Grigson to get as much money onto the 2016 cap as possible. And indeed, Allen's cap hit drops to $6 million during 2017 and 2018, with no guaranteed money on the deal after 2016. This is really a two-year deal, and given that Allen's role will likely expand in a second season under Rob Chudzinski, it's one that could look good for the Colts.

Malik Jackson (Jaguars): B

The Jaguars needed to get out of their habit of paying market value or better salaries to questionable players, given how rarely those contracts have succeeded for general manager Dave Caldwell over the last few years. The first wave of those deals flamed out, with Zane Beadles and Toby Gerhart released over the past week. The Jags needed to invest in the top of the market and go after the sort of superstar they can't easily acquire for cheap, leveraging their massive cap room to simply outspend the competition for a top-tier player.

Is Jackson that guy? It's hard to say, but he has far more of a pedigree than the likes of Davon House or Jermey Parnell. Jackson's contract -- reportedly six years and $90 million with a staggering $42 million guaranteed -- is surely based in part on what he did during Denver's march to the Super Bowl, where he looked like one of the best defensive players in all of football (albeit surrounded by a pair of the best pass-rushers in football). He's very good, but I'm not sure that three-game sample is representative of his usual impact. Jackson had 25 tackles against the run and 16 quarterback knockdowns during the regular season; in the postseason, he had eight run tackles and four QB hits. There's far more to Jackson's game than penetrating and making big plays, but everyone noticed Jackson in January because he was penetrating and making big plays.

It's an overpay, but even if Jackson is the guy he looked like during the regular season, he'll be an enormous upgrade on the likes of Tyson Alualu and Roy Miller on the interior for the Jaguars. With Jackson and Jared Odrick joined by 2015 first-rounder Dante Fowler (who missed the entire season after tearing his ACL), the Jags have one of the more expensively-assembled defensive lines in all of football. If the league's seventh-worst defense is going to get better, now is the time for Gus Bradley.

Chris Ivory (Jaguars): D+

The decision to go after Ivory seems far less inspired. Despite the presence of 2015 second-rounder T.J. Yeldon on the roster -- whom Gus Bradley was talking up as an every-down back as recently as last month -- the Jags have reportedly agreed to give Ivory a three-year deal averaging in excess of $6 million per year. Dave Caldwell usually structures his deals for mid-tier players without much in the way of guaranteed money after the first year, so it wouldn't be a surprise to see this turn out to be a one- or two-year deal in reality.

Even so, it's hard to see this working out well for the Jaguars. Bruising, contact-seeking backs like Ivory rarely stay healthy or have long, sustained peaks. The most similar recent back to Ivory in terms of style and size is Marion Barber, who was very effective before signing a big contact extension with the Cowboys and almost immediately becoming a financial albatross. It's also bizarre to see the Jags throw a roadblock into Yeldon's path; the Alabama product didn't look like a star in his first year, but the list of second-round halfbacks who broke out in their second season is pretty long. The Jags were sure enough about Yeldon to take him with the 36th pick last year; are they already so sure that he isn't a franchise back that they're going to limit him to the smaller end of a timeshare? This isn't a financially prudent move, but the Jaguars have money to burn. What's more painful here is the opportunity cost of not finding a cheap veteran back or learning more about what Yeldon can and cannot do.

Kelechi Osemele (Raiders): B+

One of the more obvious fits of team and player heading into this offseason, it's no surprise that Osemele will find himself wearing silver and black. The Raiders have built their turnaround upon a strong, expensive offensive line, and with Donald Penn likely leaving town, they were in need of a left tackle. Osemele has spent most of his pro career at guard and only suited up at the line's most important position during the final month of a lost regular season in Baltimore, but that was enough for Reggie McKenzie, who has been comfortable placing bets on how a player's performed in a small sample in the past; remember that he nearly signed Rodger Saffold to a massive deal after seeing him move to guard for the final month of the 2013 season, only for Saffold to ""fail his physical"".

The Raiders had oodles of cap room, which allowed them to outspend virtually all of Osemele's other suitors. The structure of Osemele's five-year, $60-million deal isn't yet public, but the implication is that he's being paid like he'll be a left tackle. The largest cap hit for any guard in the league is $8.1 million; 16 different tackles make more than that figure, including the $14 million cap hit for Tyron Smith this season. If Osemele lives up to expectations at tackle, this is a good deal. If he's merely one of the league's better guards, it's an overpay for a good player in the prime of his career. The only real concern about Osemele is his surgically-repaired back.

As for the Ravens, it's hard to avoid noticing the sheer amount of young talent they've been shedding on an annual basis in free agency. Young players who could and really should have been part of the core of Baltimore's future -- Osemele, Pernell McPhee, Arthur Jones, and even Torrey Smith -- have left in consecutive offseasons. Their deals haven't necessarily worked out elsewhere, but in part, they've left because the Ravens have made bets on other young players who haven't worked out, like Lardarius Webb and Dennis Pitta. (The deleterious impact of cutting Ray Rice didn't help matters.) The Ravens know what they're doing, and when they're not being waylaid by staggering amounts of injuries, they do just fine. Even with that being said, nobody likes losing young stars like Osemele, even if he'll net Baltimore a compensatory pick next year.

Bruce Irvin (Raiders): C+

Contract terms haven't been revealed, but this is a more curious move. Irvin never developed into the Aldon Smith-esque pass rusher the Seahawks were hoping he would become after taking him in the first round of the 2012 draft, but he still accrued 22 sacks in four seasons. Seattle moved him to strong-side linebacker in their base packages after his first season, but routinely brought him onto the line of scrimmage on passing downs. He should end up there regularly as a 4-3 defensive end for Raiders defensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr., who was formerly Irvin's linebackers coach in Seattle. Irvin unquestionably benefited from the presence of Michael Bennett and Cliff Avril in Seattle, but in Oakland, he'll get to enjoy one-on-ones while opposing offenses sweat Khalil Mack, so that shouldn't be much different.

Charles Johnson (Panthers): A

Value is everything. At just over $15 million, Johnson's original cap hold was untenable. It was insane to even consider paying a 29-year-old who had one sack last year that much money. The Panthers incurred a $4 million dead cap charge by releasing Johnson, but after bringing him back on a one-year, $3 million deal yesterday, they'll get Johnson's services for 2016 at just over $7 million. That's remarkably team-friendly, and it speaks to just how badly Johnson wanted to stay around Ron Rivera and Sean McDermott, given how his people made sure to get out the word that Johnson turned down $6 million per year elsewhere. To get Johnson to agree to a one-year, $3-million deal, even if it includes further incentives, is one of the most impressive moves Dave Gettleman's pulled as Panthers GM.

Mario Williams (Dolphins): C

It's hard to figure out the Dolphins, who seem to stick their finger into the socket, get shocked, and wonder how many of their other fingers can fit inside. Miami's top-heavy, stars-and-replacement talent roster philosophy hasn't worked for years, but instead of getting away from the tactic, the Dolphins are doubling down in 2016, swapping out stars for slightly younger stars. Brent Grimes is likely to leave once the Dolphins confirm their deal for Eagles cornerback Byron Maxwell, while the injured Cameron Wake (and/or the transition tagged-Olivier Vernon) might very well be dumped for Williams, who inked a two-year, $17-million deal to come to Miami.

The Dolphins didn't have many other options available, especially once Jason Pierre-Paul agreed to return to New York on a one-year deal, but Williams is 31 and was just run out of Buffalo amidst a cloud of anonymous sources saying derogatory things about Williams's effort level. Would they have been better off locking up Vernon, who is just 25 and had 36 quarterback knockdowns to Williams's 11 in 2015? Or using the money saved by cutting Wake to add much-needed depth around the roster? Do these sorts of questions ever even enter into Miami's thinking during the offseason? Williams should be better as a 4-3 defensive end than he was dropping off the line of scrimmage at times as a 3-4 outside linebacker for Rex Ryan last year, but this is another step in a tired, unsuccessful roster-building model for the Dolphins.",[]

It was after she moved to New York City in 2005 to work in mergers and acquisitions for HSBC. She was thrilled with the job. It was intense and exciting, an around-the-clock marathon of 14- and 16-hour days sprinkled with 3 a.m. conference calls to China.

""I can't even remember having anything in my refrigerator at home,"" she says. ""All my meals were ordered out in the office.""

When she wasn't working she was out late, drinking with friends. She started smoking just so she could leave her office for a few minutes, because going out to eat or for a walk wasn't part of the culture.

Smoke breaks, however, were OK.

""I was just so desperate for a moment to myself, a moment away from my computer, a moment to have some mental relaxation for a minute or two,"" she recalls.

For nearly five years, Piampiano was glued to that treadmill. She traveled for work, made good money, bought a Manhattan apartment and had it gutted and redesigned. She thought she'd be there for years. Her path seemed clear -- until she found something she liked even better: racing in triathlons.

Editor's Picks Ellen Hart inspiring with titles, fight against eating disorders Ellen Hart was an Olympic-level runner in the 1980s. Now, she's spreading the fight against eating disorders even more widely thanks to five age-division world endurance titles in 50 days.

Since doing her first in 2009 on a bet, Piampiano -- a 5-foot-7, 120-pound bundle of energy -- has thrown herself completely into the sport. She began working with noted coach Matt Dixon in 2010, quit her job and moved to California in 2011, turned pro in 2012 at the age of 31, and then won the Ironman 70.3 New Orleans in just her third pro event.

Now, after a brilliant 2015 in which she finished seventh at the Ironman World Championships in Kona, Hawaii, and won her first full-Ironman distance race in Australia in December, the 35-year-old Piampiano now ranks among the sport's best.

She has brought the same intensity she displayed in the financial world to triathlon courses. It's what her younger brother, John-Mark, has seen since they were kids in Maine. As a competitor, Sarah would push through any pain threshold.

""If it hurt too badly, we were going to stop,"" John-Mark says of himself and his brother. ""She didn't have that trigger. She would be willing to go almost to the point of collapse, even at a very young age.""

'Ready to go world class'

Dixon, who runs Purplepatch Fitness in the Bay Area, says he wasn't surprised by her breakout year.

""It just validated the journey she's been on,"" he says.

He thought the breakthrough would be in 2014, but she suffered a broken femur that benched her for months.

""I said (in 2014), 'Watch out, this girl's ready to go world class.' And she did,"" he says of her 2015 season. ""It was just reflective of her preparation ... Every overnight success is 10 years in the making and Sarah's a great example of that.""

Aside from winning Ironman Western Australia and being in the top 10 at Kona in October, she had a third at Ironman Austria in June; a sixth at the North American Ironman Championships in Texas in May; won the Ironman 70.3 in New Orleans in April; and was second, third and fifth in three other 70.3s.

""I just kept getting stronger and stronger through the season,"" says Piampiano, who lives in San Rafael, north of the Golden Gate Bridge.

Now, as she revs up her training for her 2016 debut at the Ironman 70.3 in Monterrey, Mexico, on March 20, Piampiano is hoping to pick up where she left off. She's No. 6 in the world in the Kona Points Ranking System for pro Ironman athletes. This year's schedule has six half-Ironman and three Ironman triathlons, including the World Championships and Western Australia.

""My goal is to win Kona,"" she says. She knows that may not happen this year. She may still have to take another step, but wants to finish on the podium this October.

Her route to get there will be a bit different, though.

She's a weak swimmer, strong cyclist and excellent runner. She'll continue to work to improve her swimming -- she was second-to-last out of the water at Kona -- but she and Dixon believe she can keep climbing the ranks by honing her strengths.

""If I'm going to continue to be a weaker swimmer, that means I have to be that much stronger a cyclist, and I have to run in the mid 2:50s off the bike in Kona to be able to contend for a podium,"" she says.

""We're putting more eggs in a basket for what my strengths are, biking and running, because we think there's a lot of minutes to be gained in those.""

In her victory in Western Australia, she was out of the water 7-9 minutes after the leaders, stayed close to the strongest cyclists (Mareen Hufe, Yvonne van Vlerken), and then pulled away in the marathon with a 3:01:18, almost nine minutes faster than second-place Hufe and 14-plus minutes better than van Vlerken. Her overall time of 9:03:46 topped Hufe's 9:09:15.

Piampiano thought she'd be emotional after her first Ironman win, but she wasn't. At Kona, she had shed tears for finishing top 10. In Australia, it simply seemed like the next step.

""It wasn't like it came out of nowhere,"" she says. ""It wasn't this massive surprise. But it didn't take away from the satisfaction that I felt, and also just the relief of finally reaching the goal that I've had for so long.""

A hard sell

Today, Dixon is Piampiano's biggest fan, but that wasn't always the case.

In 2010, when Piampiano decided she would get serious about triathlon, she contacted Dixon, a former pro triathlete who's coached some of the biggest names in the sport.

After considering her pitch, he declined.

""I think her best result was one or two podiums in her age group, in obviously amateur events,"" he recalls. ""She had never raced an Ironman. I just felt I was too busy with my current crop of professionals.""

Piampiano took that as a challenge. She flew to San Francisco, called Dixon and invited him to have coffee with her. She made another pitch. This time it was a strike. He knew within 10 minutes she had something special.

""She just had that magic kernel of grit and determination, that sort of aura of relentlessness,"" he says.

He became her coach with one condition: she had to wait to turn pro. He said she wasn't ready and he'd tell her when she was. She flew back to New York and juggled work with training (under Dixon's long-distance direction) through 2010 and '11.

In 2011, she was the top amateur (and 23rd overall woman) at the Ironman World Championships and was the No. 1 amateur in four other 70.3 or full-Ironman events. At that point, Dixon gave her the green light to turn pro.

In her professional debut she was seventh at Ironman Cozumel in Mexico in November of 2011.

At that point, she quit HSBC, said goodbye to her Manhattan apartment and moved to Santa Monica, Calif., to work with swim coach Gerry Rodrigues, whose Tower 26 program partners with Dixon's Purplepatch. Rodrigues and Dixon continued to oversee her progress until she moved to the Bay Area in early 2014 to work with Dixon on a daily basis.

The broken femur stopped her charge that year. It grew from a stress fracture near the hip, and she was forced to rest so it could heal. She didn't compete for almost six months. When she did come back, at the Ironman 70.3 in Miami in late October of 2014, she wasn't strong.

""It made me realize how much harder I had to work and how much further I had to go to get back to a level where I was going to be competitive,"" she says.

A year later, she was in the top 10 at Kona.

Trading a Manhattan office for a home base in California is just one of the reasons Sarah Piampiano has to smile these days. Larry Rosa

Betting on herself

She says now that she couldn't possibly have imagined 10 years ago that she'd leave the financial world to become a pro athlete.

Where once she had to puff cigarettes to get outside, now she spends every day under the sun, training and competing the way she did as a kid when she was a distance runner and skier.

Back then she'd dreamed of being an Olympic or pro skier. Now she's living that dream, but with a couple of plot twists.

""I feel like I'm pursuing something and doing something that my whole life I was supposed to be doing,"" she says.

When John-Mark learned his sister was abandoning her career to become a pro athlete, at first he thought she was making a mistake. He thought she had the talent, but that it was too late. She was a terrific runner but a relative novice as a cyclist and swimmer. He recalls thinking, ""You missed your window.""

But he's never doubted her drive. He says the Piampiano kids share an almost ""unrealistic optimism"" in tackling challenges. That attitude took Sarah a long way in a short time.

""We believe we can do things if we just put our heads down and put our minds to it and work really hard,"" he says. ""It's especially strong in Sarah, on a level that even my brother and I don't have.""

Which is what lured Sarah into triathlon in the first place.

One late night in 2009, sitting in a bar with friends, a former college classmate told her he was training for a short triathlon.

""One thing led to another and we were betting and all our friends were suddenly betting whether or not I could beat (him),"" she says.

She was out of shape, didn't own a bike and couldn't remember the last time she swam, yet was convinced she could beat him. The bet: the loser buys dinner at any spot in New York.

""In the moment it sounded like a great idea,"" she says, ""but as I got closer to the race I thought, 'What did I get myself into?'""

She struggled on race day, especially during the swim when the crowd made her nervous. Still, she won the bet and it was a life-changing moment. She says it reignited her competitive spirit and she was inspired by the older and overweight men and women who were racing, and loving it.

After that she started training, quit smoking and knocked 40 minutes off her time in her next race. She was hooked.

Six years later, Piampiano is still getting better. Dixon cites her ""absolute professionalism,"" dedication and belief in herself. The overnight success has paid her dues.

Says Dixon: ""In many ways, there's no better story than hers.""",[]
espn.com,,Olympic champ Gabby Douglas wins American Cup,"['Johnette Howard', 'Espn Staff', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Adriana Terrazas', 'Bonnie D']","NEWARK, N.J. -- Gabrielle Douglas grabbed the American Cup with her right hand, the silver chalice offering tangible proof to her doubters that her bid for another run at glory is very much A Thing.

Yes, there's work to be done if the reigning Olympic all-around champion wants to chase down supernova teammate Simone Biles in Rio de Janeiro this summer. Yet there was something very familiar about Douglas' steady and professional performance on Saturday. The pressure spiked. The stakes were raised. And there Douglas was, atop the leaderboard for the first time since that giddy day in London nearly four years ago that transformed her from precocious talent to history maker.

Her winning total of 60.165 was nearly a half-point better than Maggie Nichols and well clear of third-place finisher Elsabeth Black of Canada to give serious momentum to her pursuit at becoming the first female to win consecutive all-around golds in nearly 50 years.

It was also a sign to U.S. national team coordinator Martha Karolyi that the occasionally reticent teenager has been replaced by a more mature, more confident 20-year-old whose ability to deliver in the moment remains as strong as ever.

""I don't want to just flip it on when the lights are on,"" Douglas said before adding with a laugh, ""but I'm glad I can, though.""

Even while nursing nagging injuries that forced her to take a semi-extended break after the 2015 world championships last fall. Even with the charismatic Nichols looking to challenge for one of the three all-around spots in Rio. Even the seemingly incessant criticism on social media that her presence is just a publicity stunt designed to keep her in the spotlight.

""I just wanted to really show everyone I'm back and back for the right reasons,"" Douglas said. ""From the bottom of my heart, I believe I can achieve more.""

Consider Karolyi impressed. She entered Douglas in the nine-woman invitational rather than Biles in part to keep Douglas focused. Douglas responded with flashes of the brilliance that carried her to the top of the podium in London. Her vault remains a work in progress. She's still tweaking her uneven bars set. Yet she was at her best on the beam, traditionally one of her weaker events. Funny, it didn't look like it. She flipped and spun in her sparkly purplish leotard with an ease that made it seem like she was standing on the floor, not a four-inch wide slab of wood four feet above it.

The judges rewarded Douglas with a 14.966, tops in the nine-woman field. Karolyi rewarded Douglas with a smile of approval that comes only when the exacting leader of a gymnastics dynasty is truly pleased, praising her star for the way she attacked each apparatus with a decidedly ""been there, done that"" poise.

""When she goes for a skill, you see she goes to make it,"" Karolyi said. ""She's not thinking `Hopefully I make it.""

That's a major distinction between the Douglas of 2016 and the one who triumphed in London. The girl who used to cede the spotlight or a step on the podium now knows she belongs on the biggest stage.

""I just have that `Yeah, I got this,"" Douglas said. ""I believe in my abilities and I've got this.""

This time she was able to enjoy it. Douglas posted the top score in the 2012 American Cup but was entered as an alternate, making her ineligible for the title that went to Jordyn Wieber. This time she'll let her mother take the Cup back to the trophy room at the family's home in Southern California, the one that has plenty of room for more Olympic swag.

Nichols was nearly Douglas' equal, with only a couple of missed connections keeping her from making the final rotation more of a contest and less of a coronation for Douglas. Nichols put together the best floor routine of the afternoon, her polished 15.2 impressive considering Nichols has been dealing with a balky back and didn't even start working on her revamped floor set until two months ago.

""She showed I can rely on her and the team can rely on her,"" Karolyi said.

Japan's Ryohei Kato won the men's competition, taking advantage when American Donnell Whittenburg struggled on the high bar, letting a nearly 1.6-point lead get away in the last event. Kato's 88.931 total edged Whittenburg by .366 points. Wei Sun of China took third. Three-time U.S. champion Sam Mikulak slipped to fourth in his second major competition since recovering from a slightly torn Achilles.

""Whatever mistake I made, I'm going to go back in the gym and do it 100 times,"" Mikulak said. ""I'm not going to beat myself up and let it bleed over to the next event.""

It's something Douglas has learned to do during her pragmatic return. Nearly a year after her return to competition following a lengthy post-London sabbatical, she's doing exactly what she pledged she would do. She's training. She's improving. And she's serious about being serious.

""Sometimes in the training she's a little shaky,"" Karolyi said. ""But when the competition comes, the lights on and the green flag goes up, this is what she does.""",[]

According to the Wall Street Journal and Legal Sports Report, about 20 states already have pending legislation that would largely permit fantasy sports of the daily variety.

The setbacks have been headline-grabbing, however.

Since October 2015, several states have labeled DFS as a form of illegal gambling. But the way in which each state moved forward afterwards reveals how fractured the landscape can be when archaic laws enacted as far back as a century ago are put face-to-face with innovative, tech-driven fantasy contests of today.

A state-by-state march toward legal acceptance will likely be long and bumpy. Fantasy Sports Trade Association president Paul Charchian estimated that it would be a multi-year process.

""We're going to battle and we're going to win,"" Charchian said in his remarks at the January 2016 FSTA conference in Dallas. ""We need to formally legalize fantasy play in 50 states.""

Chalk provides a bite-sized summary of the current status of DFS in all 50 states, with updates to follow as news warrants.

Allowed states (5)

Kansas

On April 24, 2015, Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt released a six-page memo generally favorable to fantasy sports play, although the memo does not touch on DFS specifically. ""If fantasy sports leagues fall within the definition provided in [the law], then fantasy sports leagues are games of skill and therefore are not lotteries,"" the memo concluded. ""Under federal law, Congress has determined that fantasy sports leagues are games of skill."" The Kansas legislature does not appear to be considering a DFS bill.

Maryland

Maryland is one of the few states to already address fantasy sports. ""Maryland law specifically exempts fantasy sports contests from its gambling laws,"" noted a 2014 legal opinion letter sent to FanDuel. Indeed, the Maryland legislature passed a fantasy-friendly law in 2012. The Maryland attorney general recently questioned whether the 2012 law extended to DFS and has asked the legislature to provide clarity on this point. A new DFS-specific law is being considered by lawmakers now.

Massachusetts

DFS has garnered a lot of attention in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. ""I think anybody looking at this acknowledges it's a form of gambling,"" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in widely reported November 2015 comments. ""Just because it's gambling doesn't make it illegal."" Indeed, cash-based DFS is generally considered legal. However, AG Healey has proposed certain consumer protection policies. In addition, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission released a 50-page paper regarding daily fantasy sports on Jan. 11, 2016.

Rhode Island

Daily fantasy was given a stamp of approval in early 2016. ""It is the opinion of this office that daily fantasy sports may currently operate legally,"" Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin wrote in a Feb. 4, 2016, letter to Governor Gina Raimondo. ""Applying the 'dominant factor' standard, I do not believe that daily fantasy sports constitute a 'game of chance.'"" A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced in the state, a move that was recommended by AG Kilmartin.

Virginia

Governor Terry McAuliffe signed the ""Fantasy Contests Act"" into law on March 7, 2016. The new law legalizes pay-to-play DFS in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Operators must pay a licensing fee and are subject to other regulations.

Recently contested states (9)

Georgia

""[D]aily fantasy sports games are not authorized under Georgia law,"" wrote two lawyers from the office of Georgia attorney general Samuel S. Olens in a four-page letter dated Feb. 26, 2016. The letter follows a Sept. 23, 2015, letter from the Georgia Lottery to top executives at FanDuel and DraftKings to ""inquire about the legal authority for FanDuel and DraftKings to independently operate fantasy sports games within the state of Georgia."" DFS-related legislation was introduced, but has stalled.

Hawaii

In January, Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin concluded that DFS contests constitute illegal gambling under state law. A follow-up letter from a Honolulu prosecuting attorney instructed leading DFS providers to cease operating in the state. A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced.

Illinois

Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan concluded that pay-to-play daily fantasy is illegal under state law. ""It is my opinion that the daily fantasy sports contests offered by FanDuel and DraftKings clearly constitute gambling,"" AG Madigan wrote in a Dec. 23, 2015, memo. Litigation involving FanDuel and DraftKings remains ongoing, with both companies continuing to operate in the state. At the same time, Illinois lawmakers are considering DFS legislation.

Mississippi

""Fantasy sports wagering is illegal in the state of Mississippi under current law,"" Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood wrote in a January 2016 decision. Since the ruling, AG Hood has not moved to enforce the ruling via litigation or otherwise. A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced in the state.

Nevada

In October 2015, the Nevada attorney general deemed DFS to constitute gambling. In a detailed 17-page decision, the office of the attorney general concluded that ""daily fantasy sports cannot be offered in Nevada without licensure."" All daily fantasy providers vacated the state soon thereafter. To date, no leading DFS company has applied for and been granted a gaming license in Nevada. The Nevada Gaming Policy Committee is currently evaluating current and future options for DFS in the state.

New York

More so than other states, DFS has garnered headlines in New York as a result of Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's cease-and-desist order directed at DraftKings and FanDuel and the litigation that followed. On Dec. 11 , 2015 AG Schneiderman received a favorable ruling from Supreme Court Judge Manuel J. Mendez. However, hours later, Judge Mendez's order was suspended via a ""stay"" from an appellate court. Both FanDuel and DraftKings remain in operation in New York as the litigation proceeds.

A considerable amount of attention in the court case to date has centered on whether DFS should be considered a permissible skill-based contest. According to a 2014 legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, New York follows a ""material factor"" test. ""This is a lesser standard than the predominance test and effectively makes it more difficult to offer skill-based gaming,"" wrote the author of a different 2013 legal opinion letter. Multiple legislative bills pertaining to DFS have been introduced in the state.

South Dakota

Daily fantasy sports have the attention of Attorney General Marty Jackley. ""Based upon the current state of uncertainty, including the ongoing debate on whether daily fantasy sports wagering is predominately a permissive game of skill or an unlawful game of chance, it will not be my intent to seek felony indictments here in South Dakota absent a clear directive from our state legislature,"" AG Jackley wrote in a December 2015 statement. DFS is not currently being considered by the South Dakota legislature.

Texas

""Because the outcomes of games in daily fantasy sports leagues depends partially on chance, an individual's payment of a fee to participate in such activities is a bet,"" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in a nine-page Jan. 19, 2016, decision. ""Accordingly, a court would likely determine that participation in daily fantasy sports is illegal gambling."" In early March, FanDuel reached a settlement agreement with AG Paxton and will exit the state in May of 2016. DraftKings filed a lawsuit against AG Paxton on March 4 and continues to operate in the Lone Star State. There is no legislative activity pertaining to DFS in the state.

Vermont

In a widely reported January decision, the Vermont attorney general concluded that daily fantasy games constitute illegal gambling under state law. A legislative bill that would legalize DFS has been introduced in the state.

Historically banned states (5)

Arizona

Arizona is one of five states where cash-based DFS play has long been considered banned. A prior attorney general opinion found fantasy football to be considered gambling. In November 2015, the Boston Globe reported that Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich sent letters to DraftKings and FanDuel asking about the status of player accounts in the state. A legislative bill to legalize DFS is pending.

Iowa

The state bans play in games ""for any sum of money."" However, a DFS-related legislative bill is pending before the Iowa legislature.

Louisiana

In 1991, then-Attorney General William J. Guste, Jr. concluded that a 1-900 number fantasy football contest constituted illegal gambling, but nothing in the 1991 memo touched on DFS-specific issues. The Louisiana legislature is not considering a DFS bill during the current session.

Montana

Under state law, Internet-based fantasy sports leagues are illegal. Montana is not currently considering any amendment to its law. The Montana Lottery offers fantasy football and racing contests.

Washington

In 2011, the Washington State Gambling Commission pursued criminal charges against a state resident who offered NASCAR-themed fantasy contests. However, state lawmakers held hearings in January 2016 to debate a proposed law that would define certain daily fantasy contests as games of skill and remove them from the state's overall ban on cash-based fantasy games over the Internet. Other DFS bills have been introduced, too.

Legislation pending (18)

Alabama

The Alabama legislature is currently considering a DFS consumer protection bill. According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, Alabama follows a ""predominance test"" in which the relative levels of skill and chance are measured to determine if the contest is permissible.

California

The California legislature is currently considering a DFS bill that passed an initial vote by a wide margin. Attorney General Kamala Harris may release an opinion on DFS's legality at some point in 2016. According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, gambling in California requires a ""bet or wager.""

Connecticut

According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, Connecticut follows a ""predominance test"" where the relative levels of skill and chance are measured to determine if the contest is permissible. A DFS legislative bill is pending.

Florida

DFS-friendly legislation has been introduced in the Florida Legislature and passed overwhelmingly during a preliminary vote. The bill has since stalled. In 1991, former Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth concluded that certain forms of season-long fantasy sports would likely be illegal under Florida law. Current Florida AG Pam Bondi has reportedly deferred on the issue while federal prosecutors in the Tampa area appear to be undertaking a probe.

Indiana

According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, Indiana follows a ""predominance test"" in which the relative levels of skill and chance are measured to determine if the contest is permissible. Indiana lawmakers passed a DFS statute that would permit fantasy sports generally, but ban contests based on college games. The bill is awaiting signature by Governor Mike Pence.

Kentucky

According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, Kentucky follows a ""predominance test"" in which the relative levels of skill and chance are measured to determine if the contest is permissible. A DFS legislative bill was recently introduced.

Michigan

In September 2015, a member of the Michigan Gaming Control Board questioned the legality of DFS contests, but no formal decision was ever released. According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, gambling in Michigan requires a ""bet or wager."" A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced in the state.

Minnesota

Oklahoma

Wagering on games of chance is banned in Oklahoma. In 1999, according to a court filing in the New York litigation, the Oklahoma attorney general probed a private ""money hunt"" contest among dog owners competing for cash based on their dog's ability to track prey. The Oklahoma AG concluded that such cash-based contests qualified as a bet under state law. A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced in the state.

South Carolina

According to a court document released in the New York litigation, South Carolina's definition of gambling ""includes betting money on the outcome of any 'game,' regardless of the skill involved in the game."" As such, daily fantasy's legality in South Carolina was described as ""qualified."" A legislative bill to legalize daily fantasy has been introduced.

Tennessee

Tennessee was pinpointed as a curious case by one of the recently disclosed legal opinion letters from the New York litigation. ""[T]his opinion excludes Tennessee, because the authors of this [letter] are unable to reach an opinion that would satisfy the 'more likely than not' standard,"" the letter stated. In late 2015, a spokesperson for the Tennessee attorney general confirmed to Chalk that a preliminary probe of DFS has begun. A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has also been introduced in the state.

No DFS-related legislative bill appears pending.

Colorado

According to a filing released in the New York litigation citing a ""lack of clarity in Colorado law"" as it applies to DFS, the status of daily fantasy's legality in Colorado is ""qualified."" The Colorado attorney general has yet to weigh in on DFS, and no legislative bills appear to be pending. A 2009 legal case pertaining to poker considered the level of chance that would make an activity illegal gambling.

Delaware

AG Stehehjem has not made any formal ruling on fantasy sports. However, in 1994, then-Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp concluded that a certain fantasy football contest may constitute an impermissible ""sports pool"" and, in turn, be considered illegal gambling. The 1994 opinion letter did not discuss DFS in its current form. Daily fantasy advertisements were recently removed from certain University of North Dakota athletic facilities. No DFS-related legislation is pending in the state.

espn.com,,New York Mets' Yoenis Cespedes prepares to man center but prefers left,['Adam Rubin'],"PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. -- Yoenis Cespedes candidly acknowledged he prefers playing left field. But he insists he is fully on board with manning center field against right-handed pitching for the New York Mets during the upcoming season.

After three games at designated hitter to begin Grapefruit League play, Cespedes started in center field Wednesday against the New York Yankees. He logged five innings at the position and went 2-for-3 with an RBI at the plate as the Mets played the Yankees at Tradition Field.

If I had the choice, I would stay in left field. But I will play where the team needs me, Cespedes told ESPNs Marly Rivera in Spanish. If they want me to play center field, I'll play center field, and I'll do the best I can.

Cespedes noted that center field was his original position in Cuba.

When I came here [to MLB] in 2012, I started playing center field. But that same year I moved to left field, he said. That was a little difficult, but I got used to it already. Now I feel much more comfortable in left field. But my mind, and I've always said, if you are a good outfielder, you can play most positions.

Cespedes is expected to start in left field against left-handed pitching, when Juan Lagares is slated to start in center field.

Cespedes added about center field: ""The path of the ball is very different. In center field you have more time, but the ball travels more. I have to get back that sense of the direction of the ball when it comes off the bat.

Cespedes now is batting .364 (4-for-11) with three RBIs through four Grapefruit League starts.

He hit .287 with 17 homers and 44 RBIs in 57 regular-season games after joining the Mets in 2015 but slowed down significantly during the playoffs. He was 3-for-20 with one RBI against the Kansas City Royals during the World Series.

Cespedes cited fatigue as a factor.

""I think I just could not keep that up, Cespedes said about his regular-season production. Like [hitting coach] Kevin Long has said, It would have been practically impossible. I have been in the majors four years, but nonetheless, you get tired playing every day. When I was in the American League, if I felt tired, I asked for a day off and played as a DH. In the National League, theres no DH and I have to play every day -- whether I am tired or not -- because my job is to help the team. I think that happened to me.",[]

espn.com,,Francisco Vargas to defend 130-pound title vs. Orlando Salido,"['Dan Rafael', 'Pa Sport', 'Brian Campbell', 'Nigel Collins']","Francisco Vargas won a junior lightweight world title in the dramatic and action-packed 2015 fight of the year. Former titleholder Orlando Salido, his Mexican countryman, was in two of the top contenders for 2015 fight of the year, not to mention several other memorable battles in recent years.

Making a fight between them was as obvious as it gets, and their camps on Thursday night finalized a deal for a match that has 2016 fight of the year written all over it.

Vargas will defend his 130-pound world title for the first time when he meets Salido on June 4 in an HBO-televised main event at the StubHub Center in Carson, California.

The camps told ESPN.com that they wrapped up their smooth talks when promoters for both fighters -- Eric Gomez for Vargas' promoter, Golden Boy Promotions, and Zanfer Promotions boss Fernando Beltran for Salido --agreed to the final point: language for a possible rematch if Salido wins.

It's a match that immediately goes onto the schedule as a can't-miss fight.

Golden Boy CEO Oscar De La Hoya said the paperwork has been signed.

""The fight is signed, sealed and delivered,"" De La Hoya told ESPN.com. ""This is going to be the fight of the year. I didn't like it at first because Salido is a dangerous guy for anybody, but Vargas proved that he can take on anybody. We all discussed it and we all gave it the thumbs-up. It's an amazing fight, especially at the StubHub Center, which is known for all of the great fights that have been there. We're trying to do the best fights we can from the highest level to the lowest level, and this is one of them.""

Salido (43-13-3, 30 KOs) fought a pair of classic junior lightweight title bouts with Puerto Rico's Roman ""Rocky"" Martinez last year. He lost his belt to Martinez by decision in April in Puerto Rico, and then they fought to a draw in September in Las Vegas that was so impressive that it stole the show from the one-sided Floyd Mayweather-Andre Berto main event.

Salido, 35, and Martinez agreed to terms for a third fight that was supposed to take place March 12, but the deal eventually fell apart, due mainly to a disagreement over the site. While Martinez moved on and finalized a deal to face mandatory challenger Miguel Berchelt on March 12 in Mexico, Salido was left without a meaningful fight until Vargas emerged as a possibility.

Vargas (23-0-1, 17 KOs), who had been knocked down in the fourth round and was unable to see because of a cut and badly swollen right eye, rallied for an unforgettable comeback in a ninth-round knockout victory against Japan's Takashi Miura to win a junior lightweight world title on Nov. 21 on the Miguel Cotto-Canelo Alvarez undercard in Las Vegas. It was named fight of the year by ESPN, the Boxing Writers Association of America and other media outlets.

Vargas, 31, a 2008 Olympian, suffered terrible cuts against Miura and would not be available until at least mid-April, but June worked well for HBO and that was fine with both camps.

""Just when you think you're at your darkest moment, when we lost the deal for Salido-Martinez III, and you question your faith in boxing for a moment, life works in strange ways and we got a better fight,"" Sean Gibbons, Salido's manager, told ESPN.

""It's been Salido's lifelong dream, the dream of every Mexican fighter, to win the green [WBC] belt. It's been held by the greatest fighters -- [Julio Cesar] Chavez, Erik Morales, Salvador Sanchez and so many others. At the end of the day, it was a fight that came together relatively easy. When fights are meant to happen, all the stars align. It was a fight that when we started to talk about it, everybody I spoke to lit up immediately. Every single person said, 'Wow, let's do it.'""

When the possibility of the fight was raised in the media, fans responded and HBO took notice, Gibbons said.

""The beautiful thing is the vision of [HBO Sports executive vice president] Peter Nelson. After the drum was beaten loud enough, he saw that, and to his credit, he said, 'I'm going to make this fight. Bring it to me for the right deal and HBO will step up,'"" Gibbons said. ""That's a guy looking at it and hearing the people, hearing the fans and hearing the media who wanted this fight. So I give all credit to Peter Nelson for making this fight possible and bringing Orlando Salido back to HBO for what we think is going to be the fight of the year.""

""Salido has the experience and he is also vulnerable, but he keeps coming forward like there's nothing that can stop him"", De La Hoya said. ""The fact that Vargas also gets hit and keeps coming forward just means a terrific fight. They're both warriors.""

Salido, also a former featherweight titleholder, is excited to get another title shot, but blasted Martinez for the third fight between them falling through.

""If [Martinez] wants to see a real fight between real warriors, I invite him to go the StubHub Center on June 4 and enjoy a fight between a real champion, Francisco Vargas, and myself, and he will see what a fight of the year looks and sounds like,"" Salido said.

If anyone knows what a fight of the year candidate looks like, it is Salido. He won two tremendous featherweight world title bouts by knockout against Juan Manuel Lopez in Puerto Rico and had an incredible seven-knockdown war in 2014 with Terdsak Kokietgym in the fight of the year runner-up, which Salido won by 11th-round knockout.

""I believe that Salido-Vargas will give the Morales-[Marco Antonio] Barrera and [Rafael] Marquez-[Israel] Vazquez fights a run for their money,"" Gibbons said. ""It should be a great action fight that might also rival the great [Diego] Corrales-[Jose Luis] Castillo first fight that is considered by many the best fight in the last 15 years.""

De La Hoya said that welterweight Frankie Gomez would appear in the HBO co-feature against an opponent to be determined, saying ""He'll be on in a real fight."" Gomez (20-0, 13, KOs), 24, of East Los Angeles, was supposed to make his HBO debut last May on the Canelo Alvarez-James Kirkland card against former two-division titleholder Humberto Soto. However, the fight was canceled at the weigh-in when Gomez weighed in at 14712 pounds, 612 more than the contract weight of 141. Gomez has had a history of missing weight and being ill-prepared, but De La Hoya said ""he's back on track.""",[]

The deal to send Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Byron Maxwell and linebacker Kiko Alonso to the Miami Dolphins was back on Wednesday, after Maxwell was cleared regarding concerns over his shoulder by the Dolphins' medical staff.

Miami will acquire the players from the Eagles plus compensatory draft picks. ESPN's Adam Schefter reports the Dolphins will drop down to the Eagles' 13th pick in April's NFL draft. The Eagles will move up to the Dolphins' No. 8 pick.

Maxwell's agent, Alvin Kells, also tweeted the news:

Maxwell cleared by Dolphins staff and ready to roll!  Alvin Keels (@AlvinKeels) March 9, 2016

The move helps the Eagles clear cap space, as the Dolphins assume both players' guaranteed salaries.

The Dolphins had been considering backing out of the trade agreed to earlier this week because of their concern about a shoulder injury suffered by Maxwell, league sources told ESPN's Ed Werder and Chris Mortensen.

As of Tuesday night, sources said the Dolphins considered the trade dead because of their medical staff's concern over Maxwell's injury, which forced him to finish the 2015 season on injured reserve. If they go through with the trade, the Dolphins would be inheriting a huge contract for Maxwell, who signed a six-year, $63 million deal with the Eagles as a free agent last season.

Editor's Picks Sources: Eagles to sign ex-Chiefs QB Daniel The Eagles have agreed to a multiyear deal with quarterback Chase Daniel, who will be Sam Bradford's backup in Philadelphia.

The Eagles had cleared Maxwell on his physical and were more concerned with Alonso passing his physical because of his history of knee injuries. Each team has its own standards for physical exams.

Maxwell was the Eagles' big free-agent signing last season but struggled in his role as No. 1 cornerback. He was inconsistent in coverage and recorded just two interceptions and 64 tackles. He suffered what the Eagles described as a sprained shoulder in Week 15 against the Arizona Cardinals and did not play again.

Alonso battled through injuries and had a career-low 43 tackles and one interception in 11 games last season. He is a former second-round pick of the Buffalo Bills.

Both players were additions made by former Eagles coach Chip Kelly, who was fired late in the 2015 season.

espn.com,,FIFA needs more women in senior roles,"['Stephan Uersfeld', 'Espn Staff', 'Pa Sport', 'Associated Press']","A new dawn for FIFA, the scandal ravaged organisation, rests largely on if Infantino can implement much-needed reforms.

Gianni Infantino says he will focus on establishing a better World Cup bidding process for the 2026 selection.

New FIFA president Gianni Infantino says he hopes to get more footballers involved in decision-making processes at FIFA.

Tennis great Billie Jean King has challenged FIFA and new president Gianni Infantino to hire more women for senior jobs.

King said in a keynote speech at FIFA headquarters that world football's governing body has a chance to transform itself after years of corruption scandals.

BOOM! @BillieJeanKing. ""Women: you deserve the cake, the icing and the cherry on top."" #IWD2016 #legend #equalityhttps://t.co/I9FqxhSJ2H - FIFA Women'sWorldCup (@FIFAWWC) March 7, 2016

Addressing a women's soccer leadership conference, King told the watching Infantino: ""No pressure, but the world is counting on you.""

King suggested ""three concrete steps"" for FIFA to take: one-third of management hires should be women; appoint a CEO-like secretary general with ""a proven track record of supporting gender equality""; appoint staff to create a commercial strategy for women's football.

FIFA executive committee member Moya Dodd also suggested to Infantino that women's football was an untapped asset as the federation looks to boost its revenues.

Infantino promised in his election campaign to increase revenue and Dodd said women's football could help achieve that.

espn.com,,"Justine Henin, Marat Safin elected to International Tennis Hall of Fame","['Niall Seewang', 'Greg Garber', 'Mark Hodgkinson', 'Nic Atkin', 'Peter Bodo', 'Pa Sport', 'Espn Com', 'Espn Staff']","NEW YORK -- Justine Henin and Marat Safin have been elected to the International Tennis Hall of Fame.

With a classic one-handed backhand, Henin won seven Grand Slam singles titles and an Olympic gold medal and helped Belgium win its first Fed Cup championship. She spent 117 weeks ranked No. 1 and finished the 2003, 2006 and 2007 seasons in the top spot.

Henin won four French Opens, two U.S. Opens and one Australian Open despite a small frame in a game increasingly dominated by power.

""Not a lot of people really believed I could reach my goal because my dream was to become the best player in the world,"" she said on a conference call Tuesday. ""It became my goal. A lot of people thought I was a little bit crazy. But strongly, deeply I never really doubted about the fact that I could make it.""

The enigmatic Safin earned two major titles -- at the 2000 U.S. Open and 2005 Australian Open -- and briefly reached No. 1. He is the first Russian elected to the Hall.

""Very difficult to come out of the country. No money,"" he said. ""To come out of the country and start to play on the world level, I think it's a really big achievement.""

Also in the Hall's Class of 2016: Yvon Petra and Margaret Scriven were posthumously elected in the master player category.

At about 5-foot-6 and 125 pounds, Henin was often smaller than her opponents, but that never mattered. She covered the court as well as anyone, used that backhand John McEnroe once called the prettiest shot in the game, and mixed in rushes to the net -- punctuating winners with ""Allez!"" and a fist pump. She is also the first Belgian elected to the Hall.

Henin once used the phrase ""Impossible is nothing,"" and one of her sponsors turned that into a marketing slogan. It reflected her on-court philosophy, highlighted by a victory over Jennifer Capriati in the 2003 U.S. Open semifinals in which she was two points from defeat 10 times. Henin needed IV fluids after that match, which ended after midnight, but won the final the next day.

Henin also was the first woman to beat both Venus and Serena Williams en route to a major title.

""I always thought that I could use my qualities: I was quick; I could anticipate the game,"" she said. ""Physically at the end I worked very hard and I could compensate. I wasn't as powerful, but I could use other parts of my game.""

Safin was one of the most unpredictable and outspoken stars of tennis. He burst onto the scene by beating Pete Sampras in the final of the 2000 U.S. Open, and predictions of many more major titles soon followed.

But while Safin did add a second Grand Slam trophy, his career became as well known for his smashed rackets and other antics -- whether it was celebrating a terrific shot at the French Open by grabbing his white shorts and tugging them down to his thighs or complaining about the high price and low quality of the food in the players' restaurant at Wimbledon.

""Obviously back then I would love to win much more tournaments, more Grand Slams, more things in my career,"" Safin said. ""But unfortunately I had a lot of injuries also. Sometimes probably I wasn't well prepared for what I was going through. I had lack of experience and not the right decisions were taken.""

France's Petra won Wimbledon in 1946, following five years as a prisoner of war in Germany, according to the Hall. Petra died in 1984.

Britain's Scriven won the French Championships -- the precursor of the French Open -- in 1933 and 1934. She was the first left-hander to win a Grand Slam title. She died in 2001.",[]
espn.com,,Jerry Colangelo says Team USA men's basketball roster to be selected in June,"['Sue Mott', 'Gordon Simpson', 'Pa Sport', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Bonnie D', 'Johnette Howard', 'Espn Staff', 'Jim Caple', 'Marc Stein', 'Adriana Terrazas']","BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- USA Basketball chairman Jerry Colangelo confirmed Wednesday that he's sticking to his plan to unveil the 12-man roster that will represent the United States at the Rio Olympics in late June.

Appearing as USAB's representative at the U.S. Olympic Committee's quadrennial media summit in advance of the Summer Games, Colangelo reiterated what he's been saying since August about choosing a final roster without holding tryouts in July, telling ESPN that ""I never wanted to put a player in a position where he was so-called 'cut.'""

""It is the deepest,"" Colangelo said in a sitdown with ESPN after his news conference, referring to the 31 players currently in the national team player pool and his decade-plus in charge of the program alongside Duke and Team USA coach Mike Krzyzewski.

Editor's Picks Issues alone won't hurt Griffin's USA chances Blake Griffin's injuries and suspension for punching a team staff member won't by itself jeopardize his chances of playing for Team USA, Jerry Colangelo said.

""Let's put it this way: If we brought 'em all to camp and then we decided which 12, that would be really difficult, because we'd have to deal with them one-on-one. We said we would do the following: We would look at this season and the outcome of their seasons, their health status, their state of mind, whatever, and come to a conclusion on the 12.

""No one gets cut; people are selected.""

Cleveland Cavaliers star LeBron James and his New York Knicks counterpart Carmelo Anthony remain in the player pool and will have the shared opportunity this summer to become the first four-time U.S. Olympians in men's basketball as well as the first three-time gold medalists along with Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul.

Anthony told reporters this week that he indeed still wants to go to Brazil, despite being plagued by soreness in his surgically repaired left knee throughout the season. But Colangelo says he hasn't been contacting any players for updates on their willingness to make themselves available this summer.

""I'm not really talking to any of the players relative to where are they in terms of their thought process,"" said Colangelo, who in December joined the Philadelphia 76ers as chairman of basketball operations in addition to his duties with USAB and overseeing the Basketball Hall of Fame.

""When I see players it's more about relationships and being cordial and so on and so forth. There will come a time and place when we will have conversations and then we'll know. At some point I need to know.""

Asked how close he is to knowing the 12-man roster already, Colangelo said: ""I play that game in my own mind almost every day. And it changes every other day in my mind. We've got so many great players and they all want to participate. We may be in for a surprise or two at the end of the day, where someone is not going to make themselves available, but because of the depth on this roster, we could take a few hits and still be in great shape.

""So I'm just keeping all my options open. And I'm interested always to hear other people's opinions, but you can trust me: I'll make the final decision based on what I think is right for us in conjunction with Coach K and our staff ... what's the best 12 to put us in the best position to be successful? And I'll go right back to something we said many years ago. It's not an All-Star team. It's: 'Let's put a group together that puts us in this best position to win.'""

Sporting a 75-1 record under Krzyzewski and coming off a strong performance at the 2014 FIBA World Cup despite sending a team weakened by multiple player withdrawals, Team USA ranks as a very heavy favorite in Rio to win its third successive gold medal since a humbling bronze-medal finish at the 2004 Athens Games in Greece.

As with 2004 in Athens, Team USA plans to house its players in Brazil from both the men's and women's basketball teams on a cruise ship docked in Rio to ensure maximum security.

""We have sent our people [to Rio] on four or five occasions,"" Colangelo said. ""We have researched everything we could on accommodations. And we made our decision as to what we're going to do.

""Bear in mind that, since '92, [USAB's] basketball teams haven't stayed in the Olympic Village. Also bear in mind that basketball is one of only two sports that runs the entire length of the Olympic [Games].

""Because of the high visibility of our athletes, we're better served by [going] above and beyond what the Olympic people provide for us in the way of security and so forth. We do our own things to make sure we've protected our people. There's a big investment here that we'll have in Rio. ... We will not be in the Village, but our players will be in there a lot, like they have been in the last two Olympics.""

Colangelo told ESPN that, to this point, he hasn't ""heard one question from any of our players"" raising concerns about the Zika virus or the widely reported water issues in the host country that have received increasing media coverage in recent months.

""First of all, we feel very confident that we're being taken care of, in the sense that the different organizations who are dealing with this health issue or problem are doing everything they possibly can,"" Colangelo said.

""If we felt we were putting our people in jeopardy, that would be one thing. There's never been any discussion about it being to that degree or extent. So, personally, I feel very comfortable about where we are, because we have everyone looking out for our best interests, for all the Olympic people representing the United States. There's a lot at stake there.""

Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green, who has played his way into contention for a spot on the Rio roster thanks to his rise to All-Star status this season, told ESPN Radio during All-Star Weekend: ""I don't think it's much of a concern at all, because one thing we know [is] the NBA and USA Basketball will always do whatever it is in our best interests. If it means [playing in Rio would] put lives in danger, they would never do it. So I don't think many players are worried about it at all.""

After the team is chosen, Krzyzewski is scheduled to gather the squad in Las Vegas in mid-July for a brief training camp, with exhibition games to follow in Vegas, Los Angeles, Oakland, Chicago and Houston before the Yanks head to Rio in early August.

As for Krzyzewski, who is making his coaching farewell with the national team in Rio before ceding the position to San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich and moving into an advisory role for the 2019 World Cup in China and 2020 Tokyo Games, Colangelo said: ""Coach K is going to be my assistant in all that we do, so he stays involved.""",[]

World Contenders

1. ROX Tigers

Record: 9-0 | League: LCK | +/-: --

We're going to be up front with you, dear readers. Outside of the ROX Tigers and the woeful Cougars from the LMS, the discussion for second through 49th place is chaos. Korea is a dogfight between five different teams for the second spot, QG dropped its first match this past weekend, Immortals finally lost, Europe has rosters changing every three minutes (thanks, Giants), and Taiwan is still reminding us that the Taipei Assassins were the last non-Korean team to win the Summoner's Cup. That being said, we can all agree -- sit down, AHQ fan who thinks they should be first -- the Tigers are the best team in the world. Undefeated in the region that has won the last three world championships. The runner-up of last season's Worlds with an even better roster that has fixed the most glaring problems from 2015. They're exciting, fast-paced, and a band of five players that love playing the game together. You can't ask for more from the best team in the world after the first quarter of the 2016 season. Okay, are we done with agreeing with each other? Here's the rest of the rankings!

2. Royal Never Give Up

Record: 6-2 | League: LPL | +/-: +10

Royal didn't give up -- pause for laughter -- in its marquee matchup last week against the previously unbeaten Qiao Gu Reapers and won confidently 2-0. RNG is currently firing on all cylinders. Mata is back to the 2014 Mata that was the most dominant support in the game's history. Looper is back under the wing of Mata and is playing exceptionally. And Mlxg, the team's stalwart jungler, is finally on a top team that allows people to see how good he's been for more than the past year. Should Royal be ranked second in the world? When trying to figure out who to put behind the Tigers, I came to the realization that I'm going to trust Mata over everyone else. Now watch Royal get steamrolled at IEM Katowice this weekend.

3. AHQ

Record: 8-1-0 | League: LMS | +/-: --

They bleed! Multiple weeks of visible complacency finally bit the LMS front-liners where it hurts: a 1-1 trade against the 1-1 kings of Hong Kong Esports! That still leaves them with a huge lead over everybody, but no longer a comfortable one. Now they have to actually fight.

4. Team Vitality

Record: 11-3 | League: EU LCS | +/-: +2

Vitality might still be tied for first with H2K and G2, but the comparative quality of their matchups speak for themselves. Whereas chinks were exposed in G2 and H2K's armor this week, Vitality's victories were relatively drama-free.

5. Jin Air Green Wings

Record: 6-3 | League: LCK | +/-: --

Did not play in Week 7. We almost put them in second place without playing once this week. That's how topsy-turvy all the regions currently are except for Tigers' victory parade over the rest of South Korea.

6. KT Rolster

Record: 6-3 | League: LCK | +/-: +7

KT were seemingly on the downturn these past few weeks after a blistering start, but they've salvaged their first half of the split with a close win over a difficult Longzhu Gaming squad. Ssumday, Score, Arrow, and even the returning Hachani have been solid these first nine matches, but it's going to be up to Fly to be more influential in Rolster's games if they want to make a return trip back to the grand finals.

7. Immortals

Record: 13-1 | League: NA LCS | +/-: -3

Along with ahq and Qiao Gu, the Immortals have finally bled. CLG's devastatingly effective map control strategy worked even against the Immortals, finally putting an end to Huni and Reignover's record-setting regular-season win streak ... and then the Immortals ended Echo Fox's own ascendance, because even with one loss they're still the best team in North America.

8. Qiao Gu Reapers

Record: 8-1 | League: LPL | +/-: -6

The Reapers are undoubtedly a talented team. Swift, their ace jungler, quite possibly could be the one of the most gifted players in terms of pure raw skill in the world. But when Swift is bad, he's really bad, and QG have shown they are slow on the uptake when it comes to patch changes and overall macro play. They're fun to watch and can overpower teams through pure technique, yet they are going to have difficulties facing teams with better lane swapping, management of the map, and shot-calling.

9. Samsung Galaxy

Record: 6-3 | League: LCK | +/-: -2

Did not play in Week 7. Mata sends his regards from RNG as he jumps over his old organization in the rankings.

10. Counter Logic Gaming

Record: 10-4 | League: NA LCS | +/-: +4

The Darshan Splitpush Strategy has not yet found its ceiling, knocking down even the Immortals in an exciting blow-for-blow game. Though players might get outgunned on the individual performance level, CLG's macro strategy can now be claimed as the best in North America.

Playoff Contenders

11. H2k-Gaming

Record: 11-3 | League: EU LCS | +/-: -1

It's hard not to expect H2K to drop, now that FORG1VEN's announced that the Greek military has drafted him into service. It's apparent, too, in the quality of their play -- the bot lane's sufficiently shaken up that even Fnatic's taking points off of them. Trouble looms before an otherwise top-tier team.

12. G2 Esports

Record: 11-3 | League: EU LCS | +/-: -1

G2 is capable of many things, but dodging Shockwaves apparently isn't one of them! But as none of them connected against Emperor, not even Zven's Kog'maw could seal the deal.

13. Invictus Gaming

Record: 6-2 | League: LPL | +/-: +3

Invictus Gaming ... are really good? They bombed out in the group stages of the world championships. They lost their star jungler, KaKAO, to a secondary league team in China. Their underperforming AD carry, Kid, moved to the jungle. This team had all the makings of a squad poised to battle its way out of being relegated. So far, however, iG has been nowhere the bottom of the table, only dropping two matches out of eight and tying Royal Never Give up in Group B.

14. Flash Wolves

Record: 5-1-2 | League: LMS | +/-: +2

Weeks upon weeks of consistent improvements produced an increasingly scary team. Maple and SwordArT, in particular, are standouts among an increasingly maturing cast. If AHQ, still reeling from their HKE split, faced them now? No telling how it might go.

15. EDward Gaming

Record: 5-3 | League: LPL | +/-: -6

EDward Gaming feels like a team that is biding its time until the calendar turns into playoff season. They've played close with a majority of the squads they've gone up against this split, and their starting mid laner, Pawn, continues to have health issues that keep him out of the starting lineup. Athena, formerly of IEM Cologne winners EVER, has played well though in the former world champion's absence.

16. Longzhu Gaming

Record: 5-4 | League: LCK | +/-: -8

Longzhu were so close -- so, so close -- to being 6-3 and the consensus second-best team in South Korea. They'd just decimated KT Rolster in the first game of their series with Longzhu's three big offseason signings of Flame, Chaser and Coco playing together beautifully. Then they played terribly in Game 2, changed lineups in Game 3, and lost that game as well to drop the entire series. When Longzhu look good, they look like a team that has the ability to raise the Summoner's Cup. When they don't, they look more like a group that has never talked to one another before loading up into the game.

17. SK Telecom T1

Record: 5-4 | League: LCK | +/-: +3

Did not play in Week 7.

18. Snake Esports

Record: 6-2 | League: LPL | +/-: +5

Last year's golden rookies are back as one of the top teams in China, going 2-0 this week to push them up the rankings. Snake's big win of the week was over the Pawn-less EDward Gaming, taking the game in a close 1-2 affair.

19. Cloud9

Record:9-5 | League: NA LCS | +/-: -4

Unfortunately, Hai-Tier Shotcalling went head-to-head against Darshan and was found wanting -- but it's hard to blame a team for losing to a strategy that took down the Immortals. They did, at least, slaughter Dignitas in due fashion.

20. Unicorns of Love

Record: 9-5 | League: EU LCS | +/-: -1

Props to Loulex for integrating into the team so successfully on such short notice. Though it was evident that UOL were struggling in the ROCCAT game, they seemingly had their issues licked by the time of the Splyce game, with Loulex's Gragas setting up fights perfectly for Fox and Steelback's sake.

Middle of the Pack

21. Taipei Assassins

Record: 5-2-2 | League: LMS | +/-: +3

Still better than anybody below the top four; still troubled. Midnight Sun was an easy matchup for the Assassins, and returning captain Bebe is a terrifying force on Kog'maw, but that set was full of weird procedural errors, like letting Midnight Sun push inhibitor turrets without anybody contesting anything.

22. Fnatic

Record: 8-6 | League: EU LCS | +/-: --

Oh look, Fnatic went 1-1 again! For the third week in a row, Fnatic sits frozen in time at the 22nd position in the Global Power Rankings. They've gone 1-1 every week this season except one round where they actually swept the competition. Everyone knows this Fnatic team is built for the end of the summer and worlds qualification, but this is the team that has made it to all six EU LCS grand finals. Will this split be where their streak finally comes to a close?

23. Team SoloMid

Record: 8-6 | League: NA LCS | +/-: +3

On one hand, the Echo Fox game was pretty convincing. On the other hand, that was entirely due to Bjergsen's Shockwaves, and Team Liquid weren't making the same mistakes. TSM nearly lost a perfect game to TL, exposing fundamental weaknesses in their map control.

24. Vici Gaming

Record: 4-4 | League: LPL | +/-: +6

Is the talent-fueled Vici finally getting things together? They've won two of their last three, and the one loss was a 1-2 defeat to the QG Reapers. While it's not time yet to start talking about a possible championship run, a second-half run isn't out of the question for VG.

25. Hong Kong Esports

Record: 2-5-1 | League: LMS | +/-: --

When the map control synergy between Rokenia and Olleh is on point, they have a legitimate bid for being one of the best teams in Taiwan. When it isn't -- which is exactly every other game -- they get blown out of the water even by the rookies. Flip a coin when betting on Hong Kong.

26. Machi

Record: 4-1-3 | League: LMS | +/-: -5

Machi are the ultimate feast-or-famine team in Taiwan. In eight matches this season, they've either won 2-0 or lost 0-2 in seven of them. With the likes of AHQ and Flash Wolves pulling ahead in the LMS, can Machi find the wins necessary in the next few weeks to keep up?

27. Team WE

Record: 4-4 | League: LPL | +/-: -8

There was an abrupt stop in Team WE's momentum this past week. First, they dropped a series to EDward Gaming, and then they dropped back to .500 in the standings with a clear 0-2 loss to Vici Gaming. Team WE was seen as the possible surprise squad of LPL before the split started with its interesting new starting five, yet it's been the team's eternal rival, Invictus Gaming, that has been the biggest story in China.

28. Team Liquid

Record: 7-7 | League: NA LCS | +/-: +7

To call Dardoch's Lee Sin a beautiful nightmare somehow still undersells what an influence it had this week. It even managed to overshadow one of Piglet's best performances this split, adding further credence to Dardoch's reputation as this year's best rookie player.

29. Origen

Record: 7-7 | League: EU LCS | +/-: -2

Origen continue to be the definition of average. Not awful. Not great. Sometimes a bit above average. Sometimes a bit below average. The skill is still there in the likes of sOAZ and their ace, Zven, but nothing has really worked for consistently for last year's worlds semifinalists. The good news for OG fans is that a playoff spot can be locked up without too trouble unless a complete collapse happens in the final two weeks.

30. CJ Entus

Record: 4-5 | League: LCK | +/-: +3

We're finally here, folks! March has come, and that means that CJ Entus' 17-year-old prodigy, Bdd, is now of age to play professionally. His debut could come tonight when CJ Entus faces the team they already beat last week, Kongdoo Monster. With KDM and then the winless SBENU on the docket for CJ this week, Bdd and CJ could see themselves at 6-5 and in the playoff hunt with a perfect round.

Struggling

31. NRG Esports

Record: 7-7 | League: NA LCS | +/-: --

Beating the Renegades doesn't really mark a halt to NRG's downward skid, especially when the Renegades nearly made off with that game until a late fight at Baron. LOD's integration with the team's going roughly.

32. OMG

Record: 4-4 | League: LPL | +/-: +2

We're still on the Icon train. In their only match this week in a win over Energy Pacemaker.All, OMG's dazzling rookie mid laner went 14-8-31 in three games. So they stand 4-4, have a promising crown jewel in the mid lane, and their AD carry, S1mlz, has been steady recently.

33. Afreeca Freecs

Record: 3-6 | League: LCK | +/-: -4

Did not play in Week 7.

34. Echo Fox

Record: 5-9 | League: NA LCS | +/-: -6

Now that the NA LCS has a handle on Froggen and kfo, things are going poorly for Echo Fox. Team fighting issues allowed Bjergsen to rip into them again and again with Shockwave. Improvements and adaptations have to be made --again.

35. XGamers

Record: 2-2-5 | League: LMS | +/-: -3

XGamers had the misfortune of facing ahq immediately after that shocking 1-1 split with Hong Kong Esports, and took on the full weight of the reigning kings' displeasure. Westdoor, in particular, sliced them apart with Zed and served them like a sashimi buffet to Ziv and AN.

36. Team Impulse

Record: 5-9 | League: NA LCS | +/-: +7

TIP fell apart versus Team Liquid, but maybe that's excusable in the face of the latter's ascendancy. Proxcin and Pirean were made to look terrible, but redeemed themselves versus NRG by crushing LOD and Konkwon -- even making Impact's Tahm Kench look thin-skinned.

37. Splyce

Record: 4-10 | League: EU LCS | +/-: -1

We now hit the part of our rankings where we start getting to the teams that are sputtering at the bottom of the standings with almost no chance of making the playoffs. Splyce sit three games behind Origen for the final postseason spot in Europe with only four games remaining. OG haven't been great this split, but the scenario of them going 0-4 and Splyce going 4-0 does not seem likely.

38. Energy Pacemaker.All

Record: 2-6 | League: LPL | +/-: --

You know we're scraping the bottom of the barrel when a team goes 0-2 in matches and still remains at its spot from last week. While they did lose both of their sets, at least EPA was able to take a game off OMG. That's something to be proud of, right? Hooray for moral victories!

39. ROCCAT

Record: 3-10 | League: EU LCS | +/-: +6

They might be pretty much out of the hunt for the playoffs, but ROCCAT is keeping it interesting in the race to see which of the ""Bottom 4"" EU LCS teams gets saved from playing in relegations and gets another clear shot in the summer season. Splyce has stalled, Elements has fallen off completely, and Giants just brought in three new players with four games remaining. Why not ROCCAT?

40. Midnight Sun

Record: 1-2-5 | League: LMS | +/-: -1

High hopes for Kaiwing's addition to the team were quickly dashed by the likes of TPA and Flash Wolves. The problem with pulling out Leona every game is that people get used to dodging Solar Flares and punishing a binary engagement style.

Bottom of the Barrel>

41. Kongdoo Monster

Record: 1-8 | League: LCK | +/-: +1

e-mFire are now Kongdoo Monster. Their team's logo is a gigantic eyeball monster with horns on top. That's all we really have to say about them.

42. Elements

Record: 4-10 | League: EU LCS | +/-: -2

Elements' 4-10 record doesn't sound so bad until you learn that they started the season 3-1. Ouch. But hey, all they need is possibly one more win and they're safe from relegations.

43. Masters 3

Record: 2-6 | League: LPL | +/-: -2

Masters 3 gave Hyper Youth Gaming their first match win of the season, and they themselves are now stuck at a weak record of 2-6. Due to how shoddy Group A's bottom three teams are, though, one of M3, EPA, or LGD Gaming will be making the LPL playoffs. What a time to be alive.

44. SBENU Sonicboom

Record: 0-9 | League: LCK | +/-: +2

SBENU Sonicboom only have three map wins on the season. At least they play in the toughest league in the world. What do the teams below them have as an excuse?

45. Giants Gaming

Record: 2-12 | League: EU LCS | +/-: -1

Giants are changing three of five in their starting lineup heading into the final two weeks of the season. While this could be considered a risky move for most, Giants Gaming are 2-12 and need a miracle to avoid relegations. When your back is up against the wall, why not randomly bring in two Korean imports and SmittyJ formerly of Dignitas?

46. Renegades

Record: 2-12 | League: NA LCS | +/-: +1

With Seraph's help, the Renegades were not actually the worst team this week! Just the second-worst with a huge margin between them and third-worst. Losing to Rift Herald when the Herald doesn't do critical damage is all sorts of embarrassing.

47. Dignitas

Record: 4-10 | League: NA LCS | +/-: -10

Nobody's quite sure how a three-on-zero push ends with two people getting executed by tower damage, but Dignitas found a way. Nobody's quite sure how a team with an 11-0-3 Viktor can get so thoroughly manhandled by a 1-5-11 Lissandra, but Dignitas found a way.

48. LGD Gaming

Record: 1-7 | League: LPL | +/-: --

Where do we go from here? LGD are a bad team right now. A very bad team. They have three map wins, 14 map losses, and were embarrassed in a blowout against iG in their last match. The frustrating thing about all of this is how talented the team is on paper. A team with MaRin, Weiless, Imp, and Pyl, regardless of who the jungler is, shouldn't be 1-7 in matches.

49. Hyper Youth Gaming

Record: 1-7 | League: LPL | +/-: --

HYG are now tied in record and map score with LGD Gaming. They're also only one match behind M3 and EPA from Group A as well. Unfortunately for HYG, they're in Group B, and the likelihood of them making the postseason is the same as COUGAR E-Sport making it out of the 50th spot this season.

50. COUGAR E-Sport

Record: 0-0-8 | League: LMS | +/-: --

The good news is, COUGAR's never had two players get executed by a turret or Rift Herald. The bad news is, they're still the worst team in Taiwan and the Global Power Rankings.",[]

And while I would like to champion Clemson at 7-1, you don't need to hear that from me after watching the Tigers offense vs. Alabama in Glendale.

What I will try to do is offer a handful of teams that might possess some value -- teams that might see their odds reduced dramatically once the season starts. They each have some warts, but they could be worth a play prior to the season in order to get the best price.

One thing I try to keep in mind when looking at these futures is to envision whether a team can simply get into the College Football Playoff. Once you're there, pretty much any team would be capable of winning two games. I also try to approach things how the committee might -- it's not always about the best team, but more about a conference champion and who might be playing well late in the year.

Here are my five best CFB futures value bets:

Ohio State (10-1)

Editor's Picks Experts: Best early 2016 CFB title value bets Phil Steele and Will Harris offer up their very early value bets for the 2016 college football title, including the Tennessee Volunteers at 15-1.

Chalk: Latest 2017 CFB National Championship odds ESPN Chalk presents the most up-to-date 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship odds from the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook. 1 Related ""So you won't tout Alabama at 6-1, but you will tout Ohio State at 10-1. What gives, Bear?"" Well here's the deal -- if Ohio State goes to Norman and wins in September, the Buckeyes' price will probably get cut to 6-1, or somewhere thereabout. While the Buckeyes suffered massive losses to the NFL, their recruiting classes have been fantastic under Urban Meyer. There will be no QB drama in the offseason, as it's J.T. Barrett's team, and expect a renewed hunger from Meyer and his squad after they suffered a loss late in 2015 -- one that could help them reach their potential in 2016.

Georgia (30-1)

Ah, Georgia, the perennial tease from the SEC East. It always feels as if it could be the year for the Bulldogs at this point in the offseason, but this might actually be the year that UGA is worth a play. Most experts will feel as though Tennessee is the favorite in the SEC East, and that will help the Bulldogs' price. If you look at UGA's schedule, even if the Bulldogs lose to Ole Miss in Oxford, the Vols come to Athens in October.

Should they win that one, and if they beat Florida in Jacksonville, they will be in Atlanta for the SEC Championship game -- putting them one win away from the CFP. With Kirby Smart providing a culture change to the UGA program, and with RB Nick Chubb back in the mix, the only missing ingredient might be QB Jacob Eason.

Washington (40-1)

The Huskies should be undefeated when they visit Arizona for their Pac-12 opener. Then they have Stanford and Oregon in consecutive weeks, and both of those teams might be facing uncertain QB situations. With how well the UW defense played this season, it won't be an easy task for either new opposing signal-caller -- even with linebackers Travis Feeney and Cory Littleton moving on.

UW also gets USC and Arizona State in Seattle. If Washington isn't ranked in the Top 25 to start the year, it will be just outside of it, and if the Huskies win those early-season games, they'll jump right in the mix. QB Jake Browning will only get better. I think the Huskies will be a very dangerous team in the Pac-12.

Louisville (60-1)

Was I one year early in predicting Louisville's success for 2015? It sure looked like it, based on how well QB Lamar Jackson finished the season. After a 2-4 start, in which all four losses were winnable games, the Cardinals kept it together and won six of seven to finish the year. Bobby Petrino is looking at roughly 18 returning starters next year, and the Cards' ACC road games are Boston College, Syracuse, Virginia and (obviously the tough one of the bunch) at Clemson. It's pretty manageable for a team that should put up a lot of points this year -- if the O-line matures as it should.

espn.com,,Leagues appear to have upper hand in New Jersey sports betting case,"['Ben Fawkes', 'David Purdum', 'Darren Rovell', 'Mackenzie Kraemer', 'Steve Fainaru', 'Arash Markazi', 'Paula Lavigne', 'Ryan Rodenberg', 'Tim Fiorvanti']","New Jersey wants to allow its racetracks and casinos to offer legal, Las Vegas-style sports betting. The NCAA, NFL, NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball, along with the United States Department of Justice, are trying to stop it.

The two sides squared off once again Wednesday in federal appeals court in Philadelphia. After just over an hour of legal sparring, the consensus coming out of the packed courtroom was that the leagues likely will prevail.

A decision from the 12-judge panel of the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals isn't expected for several months, and even then, this case, which dates back to 2012, might not be over.

New Jersey entered Wednesday's oral arguments hoping to come away with, at minimum, a blueprint on how it could offer sports betting and comply with the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), a 25-year-old federal statute that prohibits state-sponsored sports betting in all but a handful of states; Nevada is the only one allowed to offering wagering on single games. Editor's Picks Purdum: Why do some people hate daily fantasy sports? What is the origin of the hatred toward the daily fantasy industry?

Rodenberg: DFS state-by-state tracker What is the legal status of daily fantasy sports in every state? Ryan Rodenberg breaks down the situation in all 50 states in a file that will be updated as news warrants. 1 Related

New Jersey lead attorney, former U.S. Solicitor General Ted Olson, argued that PASPA is unconstitutional because it commandeers the state to enforce the prohibition. The leagues' lead attorney, former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement, countered by saying the state is not required to even maintain its laws banning sports betting.

Olson said that's exactly what the state is attempting to accomplish with its latest effort, the 2014 Sports Wagering Law, but only at racetracks and casinos. Based on their pointed questioning and skeptical tone and gestures, the majority of judges looking down on Olson from the bench didn't seem to buy it.

""So if you say it directly, it violates PASPA, but if you pass a broader law and then do a partial repeal that lands you in the exact same place, you don't violate PASPA?"" Judge Thomas Hardiman asked.

The questioning directed at New Jersey's side tempered the confidence of even the state's most outspoken proponents.

""It's a squeaker,"" New Jersey Sen. Raymond Lesniak said after the hearing. ""I think we're headed to federal regulation, which is fine.""

Lesniak added that the state would not appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court if it lost. Two U.S. Congressmen from New Jersey -- Rep. Frank Pallone and Rep. Frank LoBiondo -- have introduced sports betting bills in Congress, but neither has gained any traction.

""As we have reiterated time and time again -- the existing federal law is unconstitutional and arbitrary; it picks winners and losers, while continuing to deny New Jerseyans the right to participate in this billion-dollar industry,"" Pallone and LoBiondo said in a joint statement released after Wednesday's hearing. ""We are hopeful that today's hearing signals the start of a new era in our state, and we intend to see this fight through to the end.""

There has been a groundswell of interest in legalizing sports betting, with even NBA commissioner Adam Silver suggesting that the underground market estimated to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars be ""brought into the light"" and regulated at a federal level. (The NBA remains opposed to New Jersey's efforts, because it believes a federal approach will be more effective.)

The interest in the New Jersey case was evident from the standing-room-only crowd in the Ceremonial Courtroom at the 3rd Circuit. A line of a few dozen people formed hours before the hearing kicked off at 11 a.m. ET. Court security officials working the area said the number of people waiting to get in was unusual.

""The momentum for legalization is hard to deny,"" Joe Asher, CEO of William Hill's Nevada sportsbook, said after the hearing.

But unless New Jersey pulls the upset, it appears we're years, not months, away from expanded legal sports betting in the U.S. Meanwhile, illegal sports betting continues across the country.

Outside of the downtown courthouse, a man at one of the surrounding retail stores wasn't aware of what was at stake across the street, but said he knew how to place a bet. Asked how long it would take him, he said, ""One call.""",[]

Roger Federer has pushed back his return to tennis by a month as he continues to recover from knee surgery.

espn.com,,USWNT-Germany About More Than Just SheBelieves Cup,[],"USWNT-Germany About More Than Just SheBelieves Cup

Julie Foudy recaps the U.S. women's national team's 1-0 win over France and if the momentum from Sunday's game will play a factor in Wednesday's SheBelieves Cup final against Germany.

BOCA RATON, Fla. -- There will be fewer people in the stands than were there last summer in Montreal. Even as spring break season arrives in Florida, there might be fewer noisy Americans disturbing Germany's coach in the hotel, too. It is unlikely 8.4 million people will watch.

Also, the loser doesn't have to go to Edmonton.

So, no, Wednesday's game between the United States and Germany (ESPN3, 7:30 p.m. ET) won't be quite the same spectacle as the Women's World Cup semifinal the two teams played a little more than eight months ago in front of more than 50,000 people in Montreal's Olympic Stadium.

Instead of a world title, the teams will play for the championship in the inaugural SheBelieves Cup, with England and France meeting beforehand in the equivalent of a third-place game in the four-team event. The math for the main act is simple: A draw will be enough for Germany to win the tournament because of tiebreakers (there will be no extra time or penalty kicks beyond 90 minutes). The United States must win the game to win the tournament.

But it will also be a game between the top-ranked and second-ranked team in the FIFA world rankings. These are the only teams to win the World Cup more than once. Both teams have a lot on the line in this summer's Olympics. The U.S. is trying to do something no team has ever done -- win the World Cup and Olympic titles in back-to-back years -- and Germany is looking to do something it has never done: win gold.

It will, in other words, be a game between the United States and Germany. Those matter. Some more than others, but all at least a little. So how does the 31st all-time meeting shape up?

Will this be a final or just the final match of the tournament?

Shortly after the final whistle Wednesday, there will be an awards ceremony. It is a familiar sight at the end of tournaments, even when the final is more an end than a conclusion.

Lorraine O'Sullivan/Bongarts/Getty Images Anja Mittag, with more than 130 appearances, didn't start in Sunday's game against England as Germany opted to give other players experience.

""It's not exactly results-oriented; it's performance-oriented,"" U.S. defender Becky Sauerbrunn said of the tournament. ""It's fun because it's not a do-or-die tournament, but it still feels like that.""

With France already beaten (if somewhat fortunately) and the opportunity now to beat the United States on its home turf, Germany could make a case for itself as the gold-medal favorite, especially with Japan stunningly denied either of Asia's Olympic spots. But asserting supremacy hardly seems to have been its focus to this point in its sojourn on this side of the Atlantic.

Already without World Cup semifinal starters Nadine Angerer and Celia Sasic because of retirement and Simone Laudehr and Melanie Leupolz because of injury or other commitments, Germany took the field in Sunday's game against England with four additional players on the bench who started the game against the U.S. in Montreal last summer. Among the subs against England was Anja Mittag, a 30-year-old with more than 130 appearances for Germany.

""A lot of inexperienced players got a chance to also play this kind of match, really tough matches on a high level,"" Mittag said. ""I think this is what we really want to get out of this tournament, of course with the best teams in the world, and compete with the best.""

It is essentially the same sentiment U.S. players and coaches have turned to again and again. The experience of competing against the best is invaluable. The results are a bonus.

The lineups the two teams put out will try to win the tournament.

But those lineups might not have much to do with trying to win the tournament.

Who or what haven't we seen for the United States?

While there have been some small changes along the way, primarily Emily Sonnett starting the opener against England, Jill Ellis has yet to break out the kind of unfamiliar lineup Germany coach Silvia Neid did in her team's second game. And when asked if she thought about Wednesday's game as a final or just the final part of a longer evaluation process, Ellis said it was the latter.

Ronald Martinez/Getty Images Crystal Dunn hasn't started since the final game of group play in Olympic qualifying, when she scored five goals.

""We're playing for a championship,"" Ellis said. ""We've positioned ourselves to do that. It's important; we definitely want the result. But certainly the big picture comes into play, in terms of continuing this evaluation.""

Balancing those aims could signal more time for Crystal Dunn or Christen Press. Both came on as substitutes in each of the first two games, to great effect on Dunn's game-winning goal against England and also as fresh legs very late against France. They seem the keys to the attacking depth the team likes to trumpet, but Dunn hasn't started since the final game of group play in Olympic qualifying (when she, you know, scored five goals) and Press has one start in eight appearances this year.

It will also be interesting to see if Dunn and Mallory Pugh appear on the field together for any length of time. They shared the field briefly in the late stages of the win against France but have thus far primarily played at the expense of one another. If only because we have a small sample size but lots of anecdotal brilliance for both, they are fascinating characters right now.

Also worth watching is what happens in the center of the field. Morgan Brian and Lindsey Horan started together in each of the first two games and through most of Olympic qualifying. Ellis might feel she can't afford to break up the young partnership, which needs to be tested by the likes of Germany if it's going to hold in Brazil. On the other hand, there isn't another position on the team with less certain depth than that behind Horan, where the inexperienced Sam Mewis could use time against the likes of Lena Goessling and Melanie Behringer in midfield.

Is there a changing of the guard afoot in the U.S. back four?

Just because the U.S. has yet to allow a goal this season doesn't mean the back line is static.

Joe Scarnici/Getty Images Veteran Ali Krieger might see significant time on the back line against Germany.

There hasn't been much of a German media presence during the tournament, but no one in the stadium Wednesday night will be more disappointed than any such contingent if Ali Krieger doesn't start for the United States. She might as well be the official German-language spokesperson for the women's team.

Though a starter throughout the World Cup and long before then, she has been on the bench to begin each of the past four games, the semifinal and final of Olympic qualifying and the first two games of this tournament. Valuable in the World Cup as a jack of all trades, Kelley O'Hara was the starter in her stead in all four recent cases.

Given the stakes involved and the quality of opponent, four in a row feels like a trend.

The United States has had a tendency to be left-side dominant, perhaps to a greater degree when Megan Rapinoe was healthy but still through Meghan Klingenberg's attacking presence out of the back. It might be that Ellis is looking for a similarly dynamic presence on the right side. Krieger can make her presence felt going forward, and she's been a rock defensively for quite some time, so she might be due a chance to make her own case.

""Kelley's done very well, but the goal is to get Krieger some time,"" Ellis said of the right back depth chart. ""We've put a high emphasis on possession and getting forward in the attack, so they both understand the expectation. I'm really fortunate to have two players like that to pick from.""

Where will the German goals come from?

This isn't an early-round game in CONCACAF where, frankly, the opponent is ancillary. Germany matters, both because of its quality as an opponent and as an enjoyable team to watch. And as Mittag suggested, it's a team going through its own growing pains at the moment.

Eric Bolte/USA TODAY Sports The absence of German scoring star Celia Sasic, who retired after the Women's World Cup, has been noticeable.

Germany has thus far scored on a corner kick earned through a French blunder, an own goal by England and a penalty kick. Those goals count just as much as those that are the product of intricate passing, and it's one more goal than the United States has managed, but the first two games didn't exactly make anyone forget about Sasic, who retired at just 27 years old after the World Cup with more than 60 international goals.

""Back in the day when Abby [Wambach] was playing, it was like if she was on the pitch, it immediately focused and had your attention,"" Ellis said. ""I think Sasic is one of those players. So without that, I think now they're in the process of finding the partnerships.""

That likely leaves the U.S. to contend with Mittag and Dzsenifer Marozsan, the natural No. 10 whose injury ahead of the World Cup semifinal cost her a starting spot in that game to the great benefit of the United States. But now also seems like the time for Alexandra Popp, 24, to make her case as a goal-scoring presence in the box.

Another change to watch is at the other end of the field, where Angerer is gone. Almuth Schult started in the opening game against France and was a big reason why the game was still there to be won when Leonie Maier scored off the corner kick in the 83rd minute. Schult didn't play in the second game against England, but she would be the logical choice to start Wednesday.",[]

Seager doubled later in the game, his second hit in seven spring at-bats. He has played in three Cactus League games so far.

Led by Mayor Eric Garcetti and four-time Olympian Janet Evans, the LA bid team unveiled its newly formed Athletes Advisory Commission, a collection of over 50 past and present Olympic and Paralympic athletes who will work directly with the LA 2024 committee to provide ""communication and feedback"" on the bid program.

Some of the athletes who are part of the commission include Rio Olympic hopefuls Katie Ledecky, Dawn Harper-Nelson and Ibtihaj Muhammad, former U.S. men's national team soccer players Cobi Jones and Landon Donovan, tennis stars Andre Agassi and Steffi Graf, and pro golfer Rickie Fowler.

""We have athletes that choose to live and train here in Los Angeles when they could be living and training somewhere else,"" Evans, who is the LA 2024 director of athlete relations, told ESPN.com. ""[Swimmer] Thiago Pereira, who is Brazilian, [former Romanian gymnast] Nadia [Comaneci] clearly aligns here in the United States, Sarah Attar who runs for Saudi Arabia -- we clearly want to emphasize that athletes do live and train here, and they don't have to be American.

""It's a testament to the facilities we have here -- legacy facilities from the '84 Olympics, our incredible weather, our incredible coaches. The culture that has been built here around sport.""

There is a combined 216 Olympic and Paralympic medals, 142 of which are gold, among the American and U.S.-based international athletes who make up the Athletes Advisory Commission. LA 2024 said it will add more athletes to the commission in the coming months.

""I'm supporting L.A., but I'm supporting the Games at the same point,"" said Pereira, who lives in Santa Monica. ""The Games here in L.A. would be a great Games, not only because it's awesome weather and an awesome city, but, more importantly, I believe there is a place for everyone in L.A.

espn.com,,"Young talent abounds, but Minnesota can't skip steps","['Minnesota Timberwolves Coach Sam Mitchell', 'Ian Thomsen', 'Ricky Rubio']","The decision was neither rash nor shortsighted. Sam Mitchell, the interim coach of the Minnesota Timberwolves, was ordering three of his young starters to the bench for most of the second half: Karl-Anthony Towns, Andrew Wiggins and Ricky Rubio. It was not so much a punishment as it was an opportunity.

""I thought the guys who played in the second half played hard -- played together, played with a type of intensity and energy we needed,"" Mitchell told reporters following Minnesota's demoralizing 116-101 loss at Milwaukee on Friday. ""I thought some of the guys in the first group didn't play that way. And they have to understand, every single night, you have to earn it.''

Is there another NBA core more promising than this trio that was assembled by the late Flip Saunders? Towns, the 7-foot rookie of the year favorite, is rivaling Anthony Davis in the debate over which young star is the league's best building block. Wiggins, the 6-foot-8 swingman in his second season, is emerging as an excellent complement to Towns, in part because Wiggins shows little desire to be the No. 1 star. The athleticism and length of Zach LaVine, the 6-foot-5 guard who has been the Slam Dunk champion in each of his two NBA seasons, creates the potential for endless mismatches as he tries to become a point guard.

NBA Rooks: Towns' Teammates Minnesota Rook Karl-Anthony Towns talks about learning from future Hall of Famer Kevin Garnett and playing alongside fellow No. 1 overall pick Andrew Wiggins.

""You don't get to sleepwalk your way through 20-25 minutes of the game,'' Mitchell was explaining on Friday, ""and then decide you've got to play.''

The difficulties of rebuilding around young stars was illustrated earlier this season by Los Angeles Lakers coach Byron Scott, when he demoted rookie guard D'Angelo Russell and second-year forward Julius Randle to the bench. The public backlash implied that Scott had committed insubordination -- as if he was sabotaging his team's plan to invest in the future. From Scott's perspective, he was coaching his potential stars constructively by forcing them to earn their minutes. He was insisting that they play with urgency and ambition and a sense of purpose.

They've got to go to B, C, D, E. And then once they get to E, now they can skip some levels. But the media and the fans want them to start at A, and then to be at F, and then be at Z.  Minnesota Timberwolves coach Sam Mitchell

Since Russell, 20, was moved back into the starting lineup after the All-Star break, he has averaged 19.9 points and 5.0 assists per game. On Sunday Russell contributed 21 points, five assists and four steals to the Lakers' 112-95 upset of the Golden State Warriors.

The job description in Minnesota is even more complicated. Rubio, at 25, is the Timberwolves' most seasoned starter. Their top six scorers began this season with 10 years of NBA experience -- three fewer than Tayshaun Prince, their 36-year-old teammate.

""The guys that didn't play in the second half, after we pulled them out, hopefully they understand that there's two sides on the court,'' said Mitchell of his young Timberwolves on Friday. ""You have to play both sides.''

There is only this far-away hope that they will understand and learn. There is no certainty.

Long road ahead for youngsters

""This is where I get kind of perturbed,'' Mitchell was saying earlier this season. ""The fans and the media, they want them to be the Three Amigos tomorrow.''

The point Mitchell was emphasizing is that his three top scorers -- Wiggins (20.6 ppg), Towns (17.6) and LaVine (13.4) -- are 21 or younger. Each is at the beginning stage of his NBA development. Altogether they are at Point A.

""They've got to go to B, C, D, E,'' Mitchell said. ""And then once they get to E, now they can skip some levels. But the media and the fans want them to start at A, and then to be at F, and then be at Z. Where we in basketball understand first they've got to go to B-C-D-E, and then after they get the basics, their talent is going to dictate them skipping some of those other steps.''

Kia Awards: Karl-Anthony Towns Timberwolves rookie Karl-Anthony Towns is the Kia Western Conference Rookie of the Month in February.

It is the potential to skip ahead that creates so much hope in Towns, Wiggins and LaVine. Their outrageous abilities incited laughter from Mitchell at this point in the conversation because he had so little in common with the prodigies he now coaches. Mitchell was the No. 54 pick of the 1985 Draft -- a third-rounder in those days -- and didn't reach the NBA until four years later, but lasted in the NBA for 13 seasons. Upon arrival, he was still doing it the harder way.

""For me I had to go A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H,'' Mitchell said. ""Because I had to, because I couldn't skip those steps. I heard Jimmy Johnson say a long time ago: The superior athlete can make up on his mistakes by his athleticism. Whereas for me, if I made a mistake, I was done. Because I didn't have the athleticism to correct it. So if I was in a bad position defensively, my man normally scored. These guys? They make a mistake, they're so athletic that they can recover.''

What these players -- Towns, Wiggins and LaVine in particular -- have been learning during this brief time in the NBA is that their athleticism is a tease. Their talent makes promises that cannot be fulfilled in this moment. They are just beginning to learn how to convert their abundant instincts into consistent team play. The Timberwolves' 20-43 record, fifth-worst in the NBA, is proof they don't know how to win.

Wiggins Dunks On Durant Andrew Wiggins flies in on the break and slams it over Kevin Durant.

Mitchell is optimistic, and yet he also remembers being the older teammate in Minnesota to 22-year-old Kevin Garnett and 21-year-old Stephon Marbury. In 1999, midway through their third season together, Marbury was traded to the New Jersey Nets because he wanted to be the leader of his own team. He would finish his career without ever having won a playoff series in his prime.

""Stephon couldn't see it,'' Mitchell said. ""Everybody kept saying you're the next Stockton and Malone, but Stephon couldn't see it. And everyone kept telling him, like everyone keeps telling Wiggs, Zach and Karl. But they don't see. They can't see into the future.

""We have lived in the future. We have seen all of this before. So we know what they can do. But they just don't think like that right now.''

Towns, Wiggins and LaVine have the potential to contend for championships someday. Right now, however, they are overwhelmed by so many details that slow them down. ""In this league,'' said Minnesota GM Milt Newton, ""if you're thinking about it, you're late.''

Their hardware is as speedy as any in the league. It is their software that is struggling to catch up.

Dunk Contest Duel Re-live the historic showdown between high-fliers Zach LaVine and Aaron Gordon from the 2016 Verizon Slam Dunk contest from All-Star Saturday.

""I'm not saying a year or two years from now the light bulb don't come on,'' said Mitchell. ""Karl has the talent to one day become a Hall of Famer. Andrew Wiggins can be a Hall of Famer. Zach LaVine can be in the Hall of Fame or make multiple All-Star teams. But they don't see it. We see it and dream about it and get excited about it. To them, hell, they want to go downstairs to have breakfast and have shootaround. They just don't see it. And Stephon never saw it. People couldn't understand why Steph couldn't see the Stockton-and-Malone (future). But he was 19 or 20 years old. He couldn't see it.''

How successful might the Oklahoma City Thunder be right now if James Harden had been willing to commit to winning championships alongside Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook? Harden has emerged as one of the NBA's most explosive scorers in Houston. The choice he made has been validated. But is he ever going to return to the NBA Finals?

When so much young talent is gathered in one place, there is no telling what will become of it.

Promising pieces to Wolves' puzzle

""I feel like I'm more energetic, outspoken,'' LaVine said. ""Andrew is laid back like there is nobody else, but funny as heck if you get to know him. KAT is fooling us all the time. It can be the middle of the game, he's cracking a joke to you and it's like, `Bro, we're down by 2.' But that's KAT: He gets his work done, he works extremely hard, he wants to be great. And outside of that, you know, he is a regular 20-year-old. Very funny and a goofball.''

The personalities appear to work together constructively. This is why Mitchell and others are encouraged that the three young Timberwolves will bond eventually.

Verizon Slam Dunk Recap Zach LaVine scores a perfect 50 on his final dunk to defeat Aaron Gordon to win the Verizon Slam Dunk Contest.

""I don't think we are going to have anything like a rock band, where after they get their first gold album they all want to become solo artists,'' Mitchell said. ""Because their personalities are not like that. Karl is really fun to be around. Cracks a lot of jokes, always needling guys. Zach is the kid that's always standing on the outside looking in, just laughing. Laughing at everybody. And Wiggs is just the type where you all can crack jokes on me all you can. He will laugh. He will get involved.

""If Andrew wasn't 6-8 and he walked into the room, you probably wouldn't even know it. And I'm not saying that in a bad way. I think with all the hype that has been around him since he's been in high school, I really think he has got the best attitude. Because if he was wired in a different way? For some kids his age, with all of the expectations and they've been hyping him since he was in 10th grade, it probably would be too much. But because he is the way he is, he can handle it. If he was wired a different way, high-strung or got caught up in things and reading all that stuff, it would probably be too much. Most 20-year-olds couldn't handle that. But the way his attitude is and the way he carries himself, I think he is wired the right way to be able to handle all of the expectations and the hype and everything that comes with being Andrew Wiggins.''

Wiggins, the No. 1 pick of 2014, will not face the burdens of outright leadership so long as he plays alongside Towns, last year's top pick. With every game Towns expresses his potential by making two or three plays that inspire visions of his ultimate future. Maybe it's an up-and-under move that blurs his black road uniform like one of the mutants in the X-Men movies. Maybe it's his ability to make sensational one-handed catches look easy, as if wearing a first baseman's mitt. Surely it is the blend of ball handling, shooting range and athleticism that enabled Towns at 7-feet to upset 5-foot-9 Isaiah Thomas in the 2016 Taco Bell Skills Challenge.

Inside Access: 2016 Taco Bell Skills Challenge Karl-Anthony Towns claimed victory over Isaiah Thomas to win the 2016 Taco Bell Skills Challenge.

When Mitchell wants his rookie center to try something new, the coach understands that he will probably have to listen to alternatives from Towns. ""I can say, 'Zach, what do you think about this?' 'Coach, whatever you want me to do,''' Mitchell said. ""Andrew Wiggins, I want you to do this.' 'OK, coach.' Where Karl would be like, 'OK, coach, can I do it this way?' And then you have to say, `Well, Karl, no -- the way is this way, because you have to do it for these reasons.' ''

By no means was Mitchell complaining. On the contrary, he was pointing out that the differing points of view may make it possible for Towns, Wiggins and LaVine to fit together eventually like jigsaw pieces.

""In order for us to be really good, players are going to have to accept their roles,'' said Newton in reference to all of his team's young talent, including third-year center Gorgui Dieng and guard Shabazz Muhammad, the No. 14 pick of the 2013 Draft. ""If you want to win, then you may have to take a step back. Because when you have all these players fighting to be the top Alpha dog, that is when you have trouble. So the biggest thing for us is stressing winning. That is the No. 1 priority. And if you really want to win, understand that there is a role that you are going to have to play, and you're going have to play it to the best of your ability.''

Building 'that winning mentality'

""Definitely all three have got different personalities,'' Prince said. ""But all three need to work on the same thing, and that's how to approach every game the same way. If you're not scoring, how can I impact the game and approach it differently? Young guys kind of give into that. If they're struggling offensively, they hang their head. I've been in plenty of situations where I don't get opportunities that I like offensively, so I have to find different ways to impact the game, and I talk to Wiggs frequently about it.''

In 2003-04, Prince -- a second-year forward -- was helping the Detroit Pistons win the NBA championship when Wiggins was a 9-year-old in Toronto. After a 96-93 loss at Portland in January, Prince could be seen talking to Wiggins quietly in the visitors' locker room for five steady minutes. Wiggins had shot 3-for-18 that night, but Prince was telling him that the most important plays had been a series of offensive rebounds that the Wolves had conceded in the fourth quarter. Then Jerry Zgoda, the Timberwolves beat reporter from the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, arrived to ask Wiggins about those very plays.

Wiggins Scores Career-High Andrew Wiggins dominates for 35 points in a loss to the Cavaliers.

""One little play can change the momentum of the game, especially in the fourth quarter,'' Prince said. ""I was talking about that and then the reporter asked him about it, first question.''

Everyone can see. But it's so much easier to recognize the errors than it is to correct them.

The mentors in Minnesota have been winnowed down this season. Andre Miller, 39, and Kevin Martin, 33, agreed to midseason buyouts. Garnett, 39, hasn't played since Jan. 23 and may not play again. Prince is the lone player currently in Minnesota's rotation with more than five years of NBA experience. Newton notices him pulling aside his teammates in huddles or on the court, in between plays, to point out something that could have been done better.

""You have to continue to have that winning mentality,'' Prince said. ""Because if you don't, you start building losing habits. So we stay on them about it a lot. They are great guys. They listen to everything we tell them. The most important thing that we can do is to get on them in that moment, just when things happened in the game.''

""I would like you to tell it to me there and then, so it doesn't keep happening,'' LaVine said of his mistakes. ""I basically want to get it over with quick. So if I'm doing something, let me know so I can try to fix it.''

It is hard when you have that many weapons, because you've got to get everybody involved even if they're not the one who finishes the play.  Ricky Rubio

Will Mitchell return as their coach next season, without the interim tag? Is Newton certain to return as GM? Will Prince be back? Will Garnett retire? Will yet another young star arrive in the lottery?

None of these questions can be answered now.

""It is hard when you have that many weapons, because you've got to get everybody involved even if they're not the one who finishes the play,'' said Rubio, who himself was the subject of trade speculation last month. ""Sometimes it's hard for a young guy learning that. I know there is a lot of pressure, but like I am telling them, you've got to enjoy the process. Time flies, and you're in your fourth or fifth season already. You've got to enjoy every second.''

On Saturday, less than 24 hours after he had benched Towns, Wiggins and Rubio, Mitchell saw something that no coach in Minnesota had ever seen before. His Timberwolves were converting a franchise-record 68.4 percent from the floor. Towns was 14-for-18 for his 28 points with seven assists and three blocks. Wiggins (10-for-14) had 26 points and six assists. LaVine (9 for 12) added 21 points, and Rubio missed three shots while finishing with 16 points and 10 assists.

""We all know we're better than that,'' said Wiggins of their disappointing performance one night earlier.

They generated 36 assists, their high for the season, in a 132-118 win over the visiting Nets. The lessons of Friday had been embraced on Saturday. And then the young Timberwolves moved on, because tomorrow was another promising and unpredictable day.

espn.com,,George Iloka's re-signing perfect response after Marvin Jones left,"['Michael Rothstein', 'Coley Harvey']","CINCINNATI -- For about an hour early Wednesday morning, Cincinnati Bengals fans were an angry bunch on social media, and it was easy to understand why.

Reports, including one from ESPN's Dianna Russini, had surfaced indicating receiver Marvin Jones was heading to Detroit for a deal that would pay him $8 million a year. Deemed the prized jewel of the Bengals' 12-man unrestricted free agency class, the Bengals had made their interest in re-signing him known. At the Super Bowl, Jones informed anyone who would listen that he wanted to come back to Cincinnati, but that he wanted as large a deal as he could sign, seeing as how the 25-year-old (he turns 26 Saturday) feels he's in his prime earning window.

Upon hearing the news Jones was leaving, Bengals fans pleaded to me on Twitter to check in on the Bengals' front office to see if its contract handlers had woken up. Those fans believed the big free-agency deals were passing their team by once again.

That was right when ESPN's Adam Schefter and others dropped the bombshell: George Iloka would be re-signing with the Bengals. They might have missed out on Jones, but they would end up keeping one of their own after all. According to Schefter, Iloka agreed to a five-year, $30 million deal that would pay him $18 million in the first three seasons.

As is the case with all contracts that were reported Wednesday morning, nothing will be official with the league office until after 4 p.m. ET, when the new league year begins.

The timing of the news on Jones was perfect for Iloka, who became the Bengals' new priority.

With the Minnesota Vikings and Oakland Raiders among the teams courting Iloka, the Bengals had to re-sign one of the more promising members of their aging secondary. Soon to turn 26 himself (Iloka's birthday is March 31), Iloka is in his own prime earning window. This new deal will make him the 11th-highest paid safety in the league. Iloka will gladly take that title after making just $1.54 million as a fourth-year player in 2015.

In an injury-affected 12-game season, Iloka had 47 tackles and an interception. After his three-pick 2014 campaign, Iloka became valued league-wide for his cover skills in the deep passing game.

By re-signing Iloka, the Bengals placed a heavy emphasis on their secondary. They not only get back one of their defenders, but they also keep him away from former Bengals assistant Mike Zimmer. Now the head coach in Minnesota, Zimmer has been reported to have interest in multiple Bengals free agents, specifically the defensive players he once coached and helped draft, like Iloka.

Safety Reggie Nelson might still be one of the Vikings' targets. Iloka's deal appeared to signal the Bengals' willingness to move on from Nelson, the veteran Pro Bowl safety who tied for the league lead in interceptions last season with eight. Per contract and salary-cap analytics website Spotrac.com, the 32-year-old Nelson entered this offseason with a market value of about $4.8 million per year.

If Nelson signs with Minnesota or someone else, the Bengals feel confident in fourth-year player Shawn Williams' ability to slide into his old spot.",[]

espn.com,,Channing Frye staying patient as Cavs work him in slowly,"['Dave Mcmenamin', 'Mike Mazzeo']","CLEVELAND -- Channing Frye could use a little more space.

Not only has he been living in a hotel with his wife and two children since being acquired by the Cleveland Cavaliers in a deadline deal with the Orlando Magic nearly three weeks ago (""We're a little cramped,"" Frye admits), but he's also found himself squeezed out of Cavs coach Tyronn Lue's rotation.

""I think the game's a little fast for him right now because he hasn't quite picked the plays up so we can't call stuff on the fly,"" Lue said last week after Frye notched his second DNP-CD (Did Not Play, Coach's Decision) in the span of three games. ""Which is not fair, because we haven't had a lot of practice days. But my intent is to play him.""

Frye played five minutes -- all in the second quarter -- of Cleveland's 106-103 loss to the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday and made a positive impact on the game with two points, two rebounds, two assists and one block as the Cavs outscored the Grizzlies by four in that stint. It wasn't much, but it was a step in the right direction.

""Like I said when I came here, I knew I was going to have to earn minutes and we haven't had practice time, which is understandable,"" Frye told ESPN.com before the Memphis game. ""(Lue) doesn't know me. I'm really still getting used to how things run as fast as I can. So, am I ready? Yeah, I'm ready. But at the same time, I'm being patient. I understand. It's not like I'm playing for a contract, our season is not going to be over at the end of April, so for me, I want to play, I want to help the team out, but I also appreciate that he's not just throwing me out there to the wolves.

""Because at the end of the day, if we're patient and we go up 5-6 games before the end of the year, maybe I might play 30-40 minutes at the end of the year when guys rest. So for me, it's just being patient and understanding he's trying to put me in situations where I can succeed. It's a respect thing. But I think he knows that I'm ready. I'm still catching on to some of the plays, some of the rotations and I just want to go out there and help, man, anyway I can. So I'm going to be encouraged and continue to be competitive and stay in shape and enjoy my time.""

Fans haven't been quite as patient with Frye's gradual on-board process. He was the team's lone addition at the trade deadline, the only extra piece brought in to help try to secure the city's first championship in professional sports in more than 50 years.

After showing a glimmer of greatness in his second game in Cleveland -- putting up 15 points and six rebounds in a win over Charlotte -- he's become a forgotten man. Not helping things: the Cavs have lost three of their last six games since the Hornets win, making their supporters restless, wondering if their team should have made a more significant upgrade for the stretch run and if Frye was worth what they gave up to get him.

Cleveland parted ways with a fan favorite in Anderson Varejao in the trade and also said goodbye to a future first-round pick.

Varejao was subsequently picked up by the Golden State Warriors. It's not like he's been tearing it up -- averaging 2.6 points on 42.9 percent shooting and 2.8 rebounds in 9.8 minutes per game -- but it still rubbed some fans the wrong way. And first-round picks are always vital for a team to keep in its cupboards.

Even if Frye never finds a niche in the rotation, the Cavs can always defend the move as saving the team more than $10 million in salary and luxury tax fees. However, the plan is to indeed play him. Frye said he has studied film to pick up sets playing both the stretch 4 and small-ball 5 positions that Kevin Love plays.

""I think at the end of the day it's just really going to come down to who is guarding me and who I'm guarding and who is guarding (LeBron James) or Kevin and which matchup is better,"" Frye said.

Off the court, Frye's already been impressed with Cleveland's restaurant scene (calling it ""ridiculous""), but hasn't explored too much because he uses the Cavs' off days to go to the team's practice facility to try to get up to speed.

""I see him being a valuable piece for us,"" Lue said. It's just a matter of time.

""I'm not bigger than the team,"" Frye said. ""My minutes aren't bigger than winning. There are situations where I'm like, 'OK, maybe I'll go in right now,' but then they go on a run ... I mean, I understand the game.""

And he understands that even if he's had a slow start with the Cavs, he's in a good place.

""My family loves it here,"" Frye said. ""It feels right. And again, everything comes with a Catch-22. Do you want to win and be on a team contending for a championship or do you want to go and play and make mistakes all day long? For me, I'm like, 'Hey, I want to win.' I like being part of a winning organization. Whether I'm playing or sitting, I'm going to be ready and you're not going to have me have a bad attitude. That's just not who I am. I'm a pro and I'll be ready whenever I get a chance to play.""",[]

espn.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Blogtable: Are Thunder a great team?  NBA.com,[],"Each week, well ask our stable of scribes across the globe to weigh in on the most important NBA topics of the day  and then give you a chance to step on the scale, too, in the comments below.

BLOGTABLE: Are Thunder a great team? | Deciphering LeBrons cryptic messages? |

More dangerous sleeper playoff team  Hornets or Blazers?

> After a loss last week, Kevin Durant said the Thunder want to be a great team, but theyre fooling themselves. My question for you: Are the Thunder a great team, or are they fooling themselves?

David Aldridge, TNT analyst: You cant be a great team with a middling defense (19th in points allowed, 13th in Defensive Rating). Nor can you be great when youre 0-3 against the Warriors. Now, with two Alpha Males like Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook on your squad, you are always close to great. But until and unless the Thunder figures out how to incorporate everyone on offense on a consistent basis, I see the same ending coming in May. Of late, it looks like OKC is making a more concerted effort to get Serge Ibaka, for example, more shots (double figure attempts in his last 10 games). Thats a step in the right direction.

Steve Aschburner, NBA.com: We throw around the word great way too easily. No, this OKC team isnt great. There are two great teams this season, which is one or two more than most seasons, and one of them  San Antonio  could slip from that perch if a priority on resting players for the postseason chews up the final week or two of the regular season. If the Spurs were to knock off the Warriors, they still might wrest the great team title away from Golden State. But if the Thunder ends up winning the title, theyll be known as the surprisingly good upstart team that upset the two powerhouses in the West.

Fran Blinebury, NBA.com: The Thunder have been fooling themselves for a while. They are an incomplete team with two great players and even with the splendid individual talent of Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, thats a recipe not likely to win a championship in the age of the Warriors and Spurs. For an elite team they cough up fourth-quarter leads because their offense relies almost exclusively on Durant and Westbrook to make big shots late. Too many other players around them with limited skills at one end of the court or the other. Thats quite dangerous on any given night, but that formula just doesnt add up to 16 wins through the playoffs.

Scott Howard-Cooper, NBA.com: Neither. They are not a great team. But they could become very good in time for the playoffs, where greatness is truly established. Thats the potential, not where they are now. The Thunder are definitely not fooling themselves, though. Durant and coach Billy Donovan, two of the critical voices in the locker room, have not hidden from the reality that OKC has been inconsistent much of the season, even when piling up wins the first half of the season, and that it has been getting exposed since the schedule turned tough. This team is struggling in some ways, but the ability to live in reality is not one of them.

Shaun Powell, NBA.com: We must first define greatness before giving an answer. Is greatness the 1986 Boston Celtics? How about this seasons Warriors and Spurs, are they the benchmark for greatness? Then no, compared to the teams above in the West, OKC is merely very good at the moment and therefore fooling itself. But the Thunder have the potential to be in that class and anyone who doesnt think so is fooling themselves. It comes down to whether OKC can play some D when it counts, and if Billy Donovan can convince his stars to occasionally chill with the one-on-one and play team ball in the crunch and be less predictable. Two very big ifs.

John Schuhmann, NBA.com: Theyre a very good team, but theyre a clear step below the Warriors and Spurs. Their offense gets too Russ-and-KD heavy, with little ability to adapt, down the stretch of close games. But defense, especially when they go to their bench, is their real problem. They rank 14th on that end and 25th since late January. They have matched up well with the Spurs over the last several years, so Saturdays game in San Antonio will be telling. But Id believe in them more if they could play their starting lineup, which has been the best high-usage lineup in the league, 48 minutes a game.

Sekou Smith, NBA.com: Great team? Not exactly. Very good team? Absolutely. And I agree with KD: they are fooling themselves if they think playing the way they have, particularly against the other very good and great teams, is going to get it done. The Thunders flaws get exposed far too often for me to believe they are title ready. And I still need to see them involve some of their role players at critical moments. Its always on KD and Russell Westbrook to rescue the Thunder when things get tight. Leaning that hard on your superstars will get you to a certain point, but you need to have other guys to fill in the gaps and make plays, on both ends, in order to take that next step.

Ian Thomsen, NBA.com: They have great talent. Are they a great team? Thats one of those questions to be answered in hindsight only. Just because they have the talent and the potential doesnt make them comparable to the Warriors or Spurs  the only way for OKC to be great is to prove it.

Lang Whitaker, NBA.coms All Ball blog: They are, obviously, a pretty good team. While their numbers are good, particularly offensively, to me the Thunder are a great example of the value of the eye test  despite a new coach and new philosophies, they seem to still end up going one-on-one and taking questionable shots at the end of games. (Unrelated but related: I dont understand how a guy as big and athletic as Serge Ibaka is averaging fewer rebounds per game than Russell Westbrook.) I like the addition of Randy Foye, but I dont think this team can get to that next level without major philosophical changes.

The NFL combine is in the rearview mirror, and while I've written about some big winners from Indy, I wanted to give an updated look across every position coming out. Later in the process, I'll go deeper than 10 players per position, but I have more evaluations to do.

These aren't deep scouting reports below. I'll just reflect movement since the last batch of these rankings in January.

An asterisk means the player is a junior (one more season of college eligibility); two asterisks means the player is a third-year sophomore (two more seasons of eligibility).

2. Carson Wentz, North Dakota St.

3. *Paxton Lynch, Memphis

4. Connor Cook, Michigan St.

5. *Christian Hackenberg, Penn St.

6. Dak Prescott, Mississippi St.

7. *Cardale Jones, Ohio St.

8. Brandon Allen, Arkansas

9. Jacoby Brissett, NC St.

10. Jeff Driskel, Louisiana Tech

Believe it or not, I haven't made a single change among the top eight here since January. I know my most recent mock has Wentz going before Goff, but these are my rankings, not a predicted order. Brissett and Driskel are the two guys who were not a part of the previous top 10.",[]
espn.com,,Matt Forte-to-New York Jets evokes memories of LaDainian Tomlinson,['Rich Cimini'],"Adam Schefter, Herm Edwards, Tedy Bruschi and Tim Hasselbeck react to the Jets signing free-agent RB Matt Forte and discuss whether he will be a good fit for New York's offense. (1:53)

One day after losing Chris Ivory to the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Jets agreed to a contract Wednesday with former Chicago Bears running back Matt Forte, ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter reported.

Welcome back to 2010.

That year, the Jets cut Thomas Jones in a cap-related move and signed an aging legend, LaDainian Tomlinson. And you know what? It worked. The future Hall of Famer, 31 at the time, became the starter and nearly rushed for 1,000 yards. He did it on a team-friendly contract.

Matt Forte has been one of the most productive running backs in the league over the past eight seasons. Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images

The numbers on Forte's contract weren't immediately available, but this has the same feel as the Tomlinson/Jones swap in 2010, a season that ended in the AFC Championship Game.

Forte, 30, isn't on Tomlinson's level as an all-time great, but we're talking about one of the most productive backs in the league since 2008. You worry about his age and the wear and tear (2,035 career carries), but this marriage can work if he's used in the right role -- as a complementary back, including third downs. His workhorse days are over.

If Forte has a good sidekick (perhaps Bilal Powell, if he re-signs), he can be productive as a dual threat. If the Jets don't add more talent to the position and rely heavily on Forte, they're in big trouble. In that sense, it's hard to give a final grade to the acquisition. We'll have to see how it plays out.

""He has one or two years left, but what he's lost is some speed,"" an AFC personnel executive said. ""But he can play all three downs and has some passing-game value. He's just lost a level of speed and magic at his age. He's not a long-term solution, but maybe the price was right to bridge the gap for a year. Maybe they still draft one. But he's someone who can start for a year until the long-term guy is identified.""

Since breaking in with the Bears, Forte has 487 receptions, more than any running back over that span. In 2014, he caught 102 passes. Sure, he has slowed down a bit, but he still has value because of his football savvy and durability. Like Tomlinson, Forte is a high-character individual, and he'd fit nicely into the Jets' locker room. He has two allies in the organization -- college scouting director Rex Hogan, a former Bears scout, and former Bears wide receiver Brandon Marshall. Forte is a pro's pro.

The running back market is thin. Alfred Morris would've brought an Ivory-like toughness to the backfield, but his asking price was too high for the Jets. If they can pair Forte with Powell and draft a running back, they'd have a nice mix -- a rookie, a middle-aged player in Powell and the older guy, Forte.

General manager Mike Maccagnan still has work to do.",[]
espn.com,,Atlanta Falcons address one big need with center Alex Mack,['Vaughn Mcclure'],"At least the Atlanta Falcons addressed one of their most pressing needs.

The acquisition of three-time Pro Bowl center Alex Mack helps the Falcons find stability at a position where they struggled last season. Mack, who stands 6-foot-4 and weighs 311 pounds, is a good athlete who is solid in both run blocking and pass protection. Not to mention he is accustomed to offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahans expectations in the outside zone blocking scheme. Shanahan coached Mack for five games during the 2014 season before Mack suffered a season-ending broken fibula.

The Falcons shored up a major problem area with the acquisition of center Alex Mack. Jason Miller/Getty Images

There will be questions about how much the Falcons decided to pay Mack -- more than $9 million per year according to reports --based on the various other needs, especially at pass-rusher. But if the 30-year-old former first-round draft pick out of Cal holds up health-wise he should be a dependable force for years to come.

Center was a position initially anticipated to be solid under Joe Hawley, but Hawleys lingering knee injury caused the Falcons to cut ties before the start of last season. That led to the experiment of moving guard Mike Person to center, which backfired from the start based primarily on Persons inexperience snapping the football. James Stone wasnt the answer, either, despite having starting experience. Stone had issues with snaps and in protection as well.

The Falcons ended last season with Gino Gradkowski as the starting center. Although Gradkowski gathered some support to compete for next seasons starting role, he was viewed as undersized from the start.

Now with Mack, the Falcons shored up at least one aspect of their shaky interior of the line, although they are in dire need of upgrades at both guards spots as well. Quarterback Matt Ryan felt too much pressure up the middle, so Mack could help alleviate at least some of those concerns. And Mack is very good at getting out and pulling, which makes him an ideal fit as a run blocker. Plus hes known for making all the right calls up front.

One veteran NFL personnel person familiar with Mack offered this scouting report:

Smart veteran player at the end of his career. Can offer leadership qualities. Better positional blocker than power type. He will run block better in a zone/stretch scheme than a power type. He will have issues against bigger players and could struggle against divisional defensive line opponents like (Kawann) Short and (Star) Lotulelei of the Carolina Panthers.

When Mack decided to opt out of the final three years of his contract, it made sense for the Falcons to investigate the possibility of adding him to the roster. Now that hes in the fold, the Falcons have to feel comfortable about what they might be able to accomplish offensively, with the defense still needing to make significant strides. It will be the first time the Falcons are truly comfortable at center since the Todd McClure days, and it should help Falcons fans forget about the failed experiment of second-round draft pick Peter Konz.

Ryan certainly made it clear after the season what he hoped the Falcons would pursue this offseason.

""You never realize how much you rely on those [centers], especially when you have a guy who was as consistent as Todd, Ryan told former teammate Brian Finneran in a season-ending radio interview on 680 the Fan. ""[McClures] longevity was awesome. He never missed a game.

""Hopefully, well be able to find somebody at that spot that can create that kind of longevity that Todd had because I think its a really important position, and critical for the offensive line to have a guy at that spot that runs the show.

The Falcons now have that guy in Mack.",[]

espn.com,,"NBA, NFL, MLB, NHL striking various business deals with gambling-related firms","['Wayne Drehs', 'Dan Graziano', 'Chris Forsberg', 'David Purdum', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Bill Barnwell', 'Eric Williams', 'Royce Young', 'Jeff Goodman', 'Joe Mcdonald']","After nearly a century of zero-tolerance policies that treated gambling as a mortal threat, U.S. sports leagues are rapidly cutting deals with companies involved in sports betting.

To varying degrees, the leagues are partnering -- openly and in secret -- with oddsmakers, betting prognosticators and data providers that make sports wagering possible in the digital age, according to interviews with a range of sports gambling officials and experts.

The deals lay the groundwork for the NFL, the NBA, the NHL and Major League Baseball to profit if sports betting is legalized in the United States, as many experts predict. But for now, the deals have drawn the leagues into a shadowy, unregulated world that includes some companies that have been accused of operating illegal sports betting enterprises.

Among the recent developments:

The NFL in April became a part owner of newly formed Sportradar US, the subsidiary of a Swiss company that provides real-time statistics, scores and odds to bookmakers, including, according to gambling industry sources, multiple offshore sportsbooks that offer illegal betting in the U.S.

Last July, the NBA, through its ownership stake in FanDuel, became part owner of numberFire, a New York tech company that offers sophisticated analysis for daily fantasy and sports wagering, including betting recommendations on the league's own games.

Shortly after the World Series in November, Major League Baseball signed a deal with a London-based company, Sport Integrity Monitor, to monitor betting lines and identify suspicious betting activity that might indicate fixed games. SportIM's parent company sets odds and provides software for legal bookmakers in Europe and Asia.

The partnerships, unique to each league, give them a foothold in an industry estimated to generate as much as five times the combined $25 billion in revenue of the four major sports. Perhaps just as important, the deals also, in the case of the NBA and NFL, have opened up new and potentially lucrative revenue streams. The product the leagues are selling? Live data -- the instantaneous statistics that form the lifeblood of sports wagering, just as a continuous stream of financial information fuels the stock market. Dollar figures for the deals remain largely unknown, but a recent agreement between Sportradar and the International Tennis Federation offers a glimpse at the stakes: Sportradar is paying the ITF $70 million over five years for exclusive access to live match data.

""A subtle bridge is being built,"" said Chris Grove, the editor of legalsportsreport.com, an online newsletter that tracks the sports betting industry closely. ""This sort of activity, I think we're seeing it normalized.""

League officials also hope they can use data to prevent the types of scandals that have periodically rocked the major sports and were most recently seen in professional tennis. Buzzfeed and the BBC reported on Jan. 17 that studies of betting pattern data indicated that more than a dozen top-50 players had been involved in fixing matches and that the sport's integrity unit overlooked the information.

But the deals come with some risk for the leagues, which are embracing an industry that is changing rapidly and pushing the boundaries of federal gambling laws. The New York attorney general's investigation into daily fantasy has sought information about the leagues' relationships with FanDuel and DraftKings, according to sources familiar with the probe. Both the NBA and Major League Baseball are equity partners in FanDuel and DraftKings, respectively, and nearly every pro team -- including 28 NFL teams -- has a sponsorship agreement with one of the rival companies. The NFLPA also has licensing deals with DraftKings and FanDuel.

Yet even with the potential risks, the leagues' moves into the sports gambling industry seem inevitable, said Nevada state Sen. Mark Lipparelli, the former leader of the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

""To the extent that they don't participate, they do so at their own peril,"" he said. ""You can't be late to the party and expect that everyone else who's come to agreement is going to shift their position to your concern.""

Technological advances have changed the gambling industry and how and when people place bets. Once largely centered around game outcomes and point spreads, sports betting now also includes dozens, sometimes hundreds, of betting scenarios within a single game or match.

Partnering with sports leagues allows data providers and bookmakers to provide that key information in real time. Without a direct, official feed, the data providers are forced to log information from spotters in stands or via TV and Internet broadcasts, less accurate systems that can cause transmission delays up to 30 seconds -- an eternity in live wagering.

""That's where basically everything is going,"" said one Las Vegas bookmaker. ""They want to be able to say, 'Hey, we're partners with the NBA and have the fastest data out there.' When you're talking a few milliseconds faster than anyone else, it makes it a big difference.""

For years, U.S. sports leagues have steadfastly opposed attempts to legalize Vegas-style sports betting, fearing it would corrupt their sports. In the most visible example, the four major leagues and the NCAA are suing New Jersey to prevent sports betting from becoming legal in that state. The court case continues next month. In November 2012, former MLB commissioner Bud Selig, one of several sports officials to testify against legalization, called gambling an ""evil"" that ""destroys your sport"" and vowed to ""fight it with every fiber of energy that we have.""

But the leagues -- including MLB -- appear to be softening in response to the growing acceptance of gambling as entertainment and the potential windfall.

NBA commissioner Adam Silver's call for legal, federally regulated sports betting in a New York Times editorial in November 2014 has been cited as a tipping point. New MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said last year the issue deserves ""fresh consideration.""

In an interview this fall with Outside the Lines, Silver said the league's relationships with gambling companies help the NBA look for signs of ""irregularities, just like the New York Stock Exchange can monitor insider trading.""

While the NFL continues to publicly oppose sports betting, it has quietly strengthened its ties to the industry.

As recently as November, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell reiterated his opposition to sports betting, telling ESPN's Mike & Mike Show: ""We think that is a mistake for sports.""

Yet last April, the league walked away from its longtime data partner, Stats LLC, and struck a deal with Sportradar US, at the time a newly formed American subsidiary of Switzerland-based Sportradar AG, best known for providing sports data to bookmakers in Europe and Asia.

Sportradar struck similar data deals with the NHL, NASCAR and the ITF, although, unlike the NFL agreement, none included an ownership stake in the company. The company also has deals with FanDuel, media clients and social media firms. Sportradar is fueling Facebook's new platform, Facebook Stadium, which allows users to follow major sporting events live, within Facebook.

The size of the NFL's stake in Sportradar has not been disclosed. In late October, Michael Jordan, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban and Ted Leonsis, owner of the Wizards and Capitals, announced a $44 million investment in Sportradar US.

Ulrich Harmuth, the president of Sportradar US, told Outside the Lines that gambling was not part of the negotiations with the NFL. ""We're the official partner for the NFL, and they didn't want us to distribute any NFL data, regardless of the source to gambling companies,"" Harmuth said.

But one source with knowledge of the NFL's negotiations said gambling was ""a big part of the discussion,"" with the NFL expressing interest in the potential for using league data in sports betting.

NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy declined to be interviewed by Outside the Lines but wrote via email that ""there is a strict prohibition on distribution of the NFL's official data feeds to any gambling-related activity or entity, globally. ... We have been consistent in our position that NFL data cannot be distributed to any gambling institutions. Our agreement with Sportradar US reflects that.""

When asked whether the NFL's public opposition to gambling conflicts with its decision to partner with a company so enmeshed in the gambling industry, McCarthy reiterated that the NFL's deal was with Sportradar US.

Records show Sportradar US was incorporated domestically just weeks before the announcement of the NFL deal. About the same time, the menu tab for ""Betting Solutions"" disappeared from the Sportradar home page, as did ""bookmakers"" from the list of clients. Sportradar's marketing materials published after the NFL deal, which tout its status as the NFL's ""official"" data provider and use NFL-copyrighted materials and trademarks, do not make any distinction between European and U.S. branches.

Sportradar AG provides NFL data to bookmakers through an ""unofficial feed"" manually logged from broadcasts, the company acknowledged. According to Harmuth, that practice does not violate its partnership with the NFL, because that agreement is with Sportradar US -- not the parent company.

Some of Sportradar's clients have run afoul of U.S. authorities. In December, The New York Times linked a Sportsradar-affiliated company with offshore bookmakers, including BetCRIS, which has been tied to multiple gambling prosecutions in the United States. Gambling industry sources confirmed to Outside the Lines that Sportradar does business with at least five offshore sportsbooks operating illegally in the U.S.

Those companies include Bovada, the sources said. Bovada is one of the largest online providers of illegal sports betting in the U.S. Sportradar provides odds for Bovada, which offers live betting on a variety of global sports, including NFL games.

In December, Bovada offered 79 bets on a single Thursday night game featuring the Packers and Lions, with the odds shifting constantly. When the Packers fell behind 20-0, Bovada changed the ""money line"" to +900 -- meaning a $100 bet would win $900 if Green Bay came back. The Packers won on Aaron Rodgers' last-second heave to Richard Rodgers.

Jeff Ifrah, a Washington attorney who has represented numerous clients in the gambling industry, said the partnerships show how the NFL no longer views sports betting as a threat to the sport's integrity -- regardless of Goodell's pronouncements. ""If you take an equity interest in a company that's running lines on the games that your teams are playing, then you must have gotten over that issue,"" he said. Ifrah has not represented the NFL.

Bovada was spawned from Bodog.com, a popular offshore sportsbook registered in Latvia. In 2012, a U.S. federal grand jury in Maryland indicted the company's founder, Calvin Ayre, charging him and three associates with operating an illegal sports gambling enterprise. Ayre appeared on the Department of Homeland Security's most wanted list as recently as 2014.

After U.S. authorities seized Bodog's domain name, the company migrated its U.S. customers to Bovada. The sportsbook circumvents U.S. gambling laws by routing credit card transactions through third countries; deposits recently made in California by Outside the Lines showed the transactions occurring in South Korea.

A Sportradar spokesman said the firm ""has a strict policy to only provide data to licensed bookmakers"" and contractually obligates them to avoid jurisdictions where gambling is illegal. Sportradar, a spokesman said, would terminate the relationship if a bookmaker loses its license or is ""found by U.S authorities to be engaged in illegal betting operations.""

In November 2014, Sportradar AG struck a deal with CG Analytics, a data firm that is part of CG Technology, which operates nine Las Vegas sportsbooks. Several months earlier, CG Technology -- then known as Cantor Gaming -- paid the largest fine in Nevada history at $5.5 million after the Nevada Gaming Control Board connected a company manager to an illegal betting ring.

CG Technology, a subsidiary of the Wall Street firm Cantor Fitzgerald, does not receive official NFL data from Sportradar, said Matthew Holt, the company's chief operations officer, adding: ""That may change in the near future."" Holt said CG receives NFL data through Sportradar's unofficial feed, built through manually logging live broadcasts.

The NFL's hairsplitting was taken to new extremes in November, after Sportradar announced that it would provide NFL data for a new mobile application that allows consumers to bet on the outcome of every play. A league spokesman said the deal was completed without the NFL's consent and ""is not permitted."" Sportradar quickly backtracked, amending the announcement to say the data would be used only for non-cash, social gaming.

But iPro, which produces an app called ""ringit!,"" said it intends to move ahead with sports betting for cash, including NFL games. Sportradar, according to iPro, is providing the data for iPro's social gaming options and for cash fantasy play. The company refused to say where the data to fuel cash sports betting would originate.

Robert Melendres, a longtime gambling executive who is iPro's CEO, said he understood the NFL's sensitivity. Asked if he believes the NFL is opposed to gambling, he laughed.

""I respect their position. I just take it at face value,"" Melendres said.

More than any league, the NBA is pushing the envelope on sports betting.

Last year, the NBA held talks about a potential advertising deal with BetCRIS, the offshore sportsbook that has been named in multiple federal indictments, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. An NBA spokesman confirmed the talks but said the two sides were never close to an agreement.

The league also extended a deal with Perform, a London-based firm, to stream at least 250 NBA games through Perform's ""Watch & Bet"" channel, which allows viewers to place bets as they watch NBA games in Europe, where sports betting is legal and widespread. The NFL has a deal with Perform for U.S. distribution of short-form video content, NFL spokesman McCarthy said. Perform can distribute some NFL content in Germany, McCarthy said, but is ""expressly prohibited from distributing to any site, app, etc. with any gambling affiliation.""

The NBA announced its partnership with FanDuel on Nov. 12, 2014, one day before Silver's New York Times editorial. Silver told Outside the Lines the league was motivated not only by fan engagement and business opportunities but also by the potential to track irregularities. The league acquired a small ownership stake -- less than 10 percent, according to sources -- in exchange for making FanDuel the league's official fantasy partner.

""By having equity in that company, and having access to the inner workings of that company, it was our view that we're much better off being inside the tent than outside the tent,"" Silver said. ""What comes with that involvement is access to data. When every participant has to identify him or herself, when he or she has to register with a credit card, to the extent that there are irregularities, you can track it directly.""

But the scope of the NBA's investment in FanDuel stunned some experts. The move was all the more surprising given the league's recent history. In 2008, referee Tim Donaghy went to prison after giving tips to gamblers in exchange for cash, perhaps the worst scandal in the league's history.

""The most shocking thing to me is the level of involvement,"" said Timothy Fong, co-director of the Gambling Studies Program at UCLA. ""This isn't like a first date. This is a first date and they went all the way.""

The NBA's partnership with FanDuel gave daily fantasy a stamp of legitimacy, even as the legality of the contests remained unclear. The NBA's president of global operations and merchandising, Sal LaRocca, took a non-voting seat on FanDuel's board. In July, after raising $275 million, the company bought numberFire, a tiny analytics firm with a charming backstory and a business model that blends daily fantasy with sports betting.

Nik Bonaddio, an information systems expert from Pittsburgh, founded numberFire in 2009 after winning $100,000 on ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire."" Bonaddio, 34, said he treated the unexpected windfall as if he had been ""walking down the street and found a sack full of money."" He decided to start a business that combined his expertise in data with his love of sports.

NumberFire ingests huge amounts of data and uses proprietary algorithms to spit out analysis on every player and every game in the four major sports. It offers for free daily fantasy articles and player analysis. Behind a paywall, numberFire offers not only customized daily fantasy lineups but also betting recommendations on NBA, NFL, NHL, Major League Baseball and NCAA football and basketball.

""The way we look at it, we're sort of agnostic with what someone wants to do with our information,"" Bonaddio said.

Three gambling experts said they were unaware of any previous instance in which a major U.S. sports league had offered betting recommendations through a partner it has an ownership stake in. NFL.com, MLB.com, NHL.com and NBA TV provide fantasy advice.

When the NBA deal with FanDuel was announced in 2014, FanDuel CEO Nigel Eccles called it ""a true partnership."" The NBA has downplayed its relationship with the company, noting that LaRocca is a non-voting observer on the board and that the league put no money into the deal. Silver emphasized that the NBA is ""not a decision-maker"" in FanDuel and did not vote on the numberFire acquisition.

Silver said the NBA was aware that numberFire offered betting advice at the time of the deal. He compared the league's relationship with numberFire to the broadcasting partnership with ESPN, which also offers gambling predictions.

""We are completely independent of FanDuel or any company that they have acquired when it comes to betting on sports contests,"" Silver said.

Daniel Wallach, a gambling attorney with Becker & Poliakoff in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, said the NBA's association with numberFire was consistent with the league's strategy.

""This is not coming out of nowhere,"" Wallach said. ""This is part of a strategic plan by the NBA to monetize and avail itself of all the benefits and revenues associated with daily fantasy and sports betting but at the same time ensuring that its integrity is protected. That's a delicate balance.""

The leagues' aggressive push into daily fantasy has dragged them into a growing legal morass.

Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and Washington prohibit daily fantasy, and at least 20 other states are reviewing the legality of the contests. State attorneys general in New York, Illinois, Hawaii, Texas and Vermont have said daily fantasy violates their states' gambling laws. Nevada officials say daily fantasy meets the state's definition of sports gambling. A Florida grand jury is investigating whether daily fantasy violates federal gambling laws, according to multiple legal sources.

One sports league official familiar with the New York probe indicated that he has received assurances that investigators there are focusing on the individual companies -- not the leagues -- but some gambling experts believe the leagues may ultimately draw scrutiny from law enforcement authorities, regulators and class action attorneys.

""If I was the general counsel of the NBA right now, I would be very, very concerned,"" said Marc Dunbar, a partner with Jones Walker in Tallahassee, Florida, who teaches gambling law at Florida State University.

In late November, the first class action lawsuit to target the sports leagues was filed by two daily fantasy players in Florida. The suit charged investors, including the NBA and Major League Baseball, with facilitating illegal gambling under state and federal laws. The suit chided the NBA and MLB for hypocrisy, with the NBA forcing Donaghy's resignation and baseball banning Pete Rose while, at the same time, encouraging gambling on their sports.

Major League Baseball said its deal with Sport Integrity Monitor, announced after the World Series, is designed to monitor betting lines for wild swings that could indicate a fixed game. SportIM has a similar arrangement with the English Premier League to monitor the lines on soccer matches. Unlike with the EPL, however, SportIM is unable to harvest MLB data and distribute it to bookmakers.

""This is strictly, honestly, just for integrity purposes,"" said Dan Halem, MLB's chief legal officer. ""We don't provide any data to the company that they are permitted to use or distribute for any purpose.""

Data tracking as a potential illegal betting monitoring tool was most recently seen on Sunday, when a sports gambling website said it had suspended betting on a mixed doubles match at the Australian Open because the obscure match attracted an unusual amount of betting.

But the lines between leagues and all types of sports gambling-related companies are blurring so rapidly that even people who have followed the industry for decades are wondering what will come next.

""It goes back to the fundamental question: To what purpose are the leagues doing this?"" said Fong of UCLA's Gambling Studies Program. ""Is this something that will make the product better? Or is it just straight greed?""

""We have the talent, but talent can only get you so far. It's about the drive and how insane you are about wanting to be great. And I have a little insanity,"" James said, paraphrasing McGregor.

With McGregor now staggering from a second-round submission against Nate Diaz in an upset loss at UFC 196 on Saturday, James supported the embattled fighter.

""Champions take lumps all the time,"" James said Monday. ""It doesnt make you less of a man. It doesnt make you less of a champion because you take an L. Its not about how you react in the good of good, its how you come back in the great [letdown] of a loss or a defeat, when people say youre down. I think hes as strong as who he was before that. [You can name] any champion thats went down. Probably the greatest champion ever in Muhammad Ali went down before. So, it doesnt matter.""

The loss was McGregor's first since joining the UFC in 2013 and dropped his overall record to 19-3. James, for all of his accomplishments, is just 2-4 in the NBA Finals for his career.

""We always get caught up in wins and losses,"" James said. ""He will be a champion for the rest of his life and no one can take it away from him. It will always be a part of his resume. It will always be a part of what goes on with him and hes determined to continue to prove doubters wrong. Hes built that throughout his career and he will continue to do that as Ive seen some of his quotes after the fight.""

James alluded to McGregor again Sunday, posting a video of himself working out on the Cavs' off day with the hashtag ""#ImCrazyForIt.""",[]

espn.com,,Stephen Curry likes Golden State Warriors' plan to chasing 73 wins,"['Espn Com', 'Kevin Pelton', 'Chad Ford']","Steph Curry joins Lindsay Czarniak on SportsCenter to discuss the Warriors having the potential to exceed last season's total of 67 wins. Regarding chasing history, he says, ""When you go 24-0, your imagination kind of goes crazy after that."" (2:27)

They've been dealing with talk of a record-breaking 73-win season for months -- that's what a 24-0 start will do -- but now that there are just 20 games remaining, the Golden State Warriors are 17 wins away from the best regular-season record of all time.

Stephen Curry likes how his team has handled the pressure that goes along with trying to catch Michael Jordan's 1995-96 Bulls team, which went 72-10 on its way to a championship.

""When you go 24-0 your imagination just kind of goes crazy after that -- how many wins can we get? But I think we've done a very good job of -- and this is very cliche obviously -- but taking it one game at a time and that's how we've gotten to this point,"" Curry said Tuesday on SportsCenter. ""Twenty-four and 0 was a crazy, remarkable start that set NBA history. The way we've played at home, not having dropped a game and just our overall level of play -- we like where we are. We feel like we can get better; we haven't really played our best of late and that's a good challenge for us to find our A-plus game as we finish off this season.""

Entering Tuesday's games, ESPN's Basketball Power Index gave the Warriors a 35.6 percent chance of winning 73 games. Although they have to face the San Antonio Spurs three more times, the Warriors play 14 of their final 20 games at Oracle Arena, where they have gone 66-2 over the past two regular seasons, including an NBA-record 45 straight wins, set Monday against the Magic.

""Last year we were 67-15 and we played at a pretty high level all year. ... Even if we didn't get to 67 wins there was still the potential for us to have a better season and be a better team,"" Curry said. ""But right now with 20 games left we obviously know what's at stake. We've just got to stay in the moment and enjoy it. This is a fun time and we're chasing history so we've got to be confident in who we are.""",[]
espn.com,,Houston Astros extend manager A.J. Hinch's contract,"['David Schoenfield', 'Scott Lauber', 'Andrew Marchand', 'Doug Padilla', 'Eddie Matz', 'Mark Saxon', 'Jerry Crasnick', 'Adam Rubin', 'Jesse Rogers', 'Katie Strang']","The Houston Astros extended the contract of manager A.J. Hinch following the franchise's first postseason appearance in a decade, team owner Jim Crane confirmed to MLB.com.

Terms were not disclosed, but Crane told MLB.com that Hinch ""will be here a while.""

Hinch, 41, was hired following the 2014 season to replace Bo Porter, who was fired after two years in Houston, during which the team went a combined 121-203.

Led by Dallas Keuchel, the 2015 American League Cy Young Award winner, the Astros went 86-76 in Hinch's first year at the helm and sat atop the AL West for much of the season before earning a spot in the wild-card game, where they beat the New York Yankees. The club then lost to the eventual World Series champion Kansas City Royals in the AL Division Series.

""We could see last year he really had a lot of continuity in the locker room, and [he] continues to get these guys to jell,"" Crane told MLB.com. ""He communicates well with the front office, and he and [Astros general manager] Jeff [Luhnow] work well together. We thought we had a good combination there. And we wanted to reward him for last year and give him some security and move the contract down the line a little bit.""

Before his arrival in Houston, Hinch, a former catcher, managed the Arizona Diamondbacks for parts of the 2009 and 2010 seasons, going 89-123. He then served as vice president of professional scouting for the San Diego Padres before resigning in August 2014.",[]

espn.com,,Froggen and Echo Fox are coming together at the perfect time,['Tyler Fionn'],"Echo Fox is at full strength with the return of Froggen and kfo, but can they take down yet another playoff team? (2:48)

The Foxes are on the prowl in the North American LCS.

A surging Echo Fox (5-7) is breathing down the necks of the top teams in the league; after a 1-7 start mired in visa issues and stopgap lineups almost derailed the Rick Fox-owned squad, it has come together with the return of its full starting five and reeled off four straight wins.

Editor's Picks Echo Fox get to full strength at the right time After spending weeks rotating in substitute players, Echo Fox is finally back to full strength. Can the new NA LCS team put it all together and contend for a playoff spot?

Rick Fox on esports: 'Either pull the trigger and go or maybe miss the boat' ""It was either pull the trigger and go or maybe miss the boat,"" former NBA player Rick Fox said of his jump into esports. 1 Related Heading into the final three weeks of the regular season, the Foxes are currently tied for the sixth and last playoff spot with Team Liquid (5-7).

The catalyst for Echo Fox's turnaround has been the team's ace in the middle lane, Henrik ""Froggen"" Hansen. He returned to action two weeks ago after missing six straight games, due to those aforementioned visa issues. Froggen's been nothing short of masterful since inserting himself back into the starting lineup, going 4-0 and putting up elite numbers. If he can continue on this stellar pace, it'll be hard to keep his name out of MVP discussions even with the lack of games compared to the rest of the field.

""The dynamic on the team is pretty good,"" Froggen told ESPN following its fourth straight win last Sunday. ""Even though we didn't play in the LCS [for three weeks], we still kept practicing with the same lineup...nothing really changed for us. It's just now that we can actually show how much we've improved.""

Team Echo Fox is on a four game winning streak since the return of Froggen and kfo, and they're making a late push for a spot in the NA LCS playoffs. Riot Games

In only twelve games, Echo Fox has already played with 10 different team members through the first six weeks. Without Froggen and Korean-import top laner Park ""kfo"" Jeong-hun for a lengthy period, the team devolved into something completely different. While the Foxes were still practicing together during their attempts to reinstate their original starting lineup, members from the minor league team Ember were more prominent in the starting five than actual Fox players.

The Ember and Echo Fox Frankenstein hybrid fought valiantly in the face of turmoil, but they lacked the cohesive shot-calling and late-game coordination that separates the top teams from the ones lingering in relegation.

""For the shot calling, we want to try and have [Terry ""BIG"" Chuong] shot call most of the time,"" said Froggen. ""And I think that's working really well. He's been improving constantly since week one.""

Froggen wasn't the only player to miss that chunk of time, as kfo similarly languished on the sidelines. A Korean amateur player that made his name in the scene through his constant Vladimir play in solo queue, his development has been similar to BIG's as an in-game leader. The first two games of the season for kfo were largely forgettable, with the young import looking out of sync next to the rest of his teammates. As a non-fluent English speaker, the weeks of scrimmaging and living alongside his teammates have been crucial for his all-around refinement.

""[kfo] has no competitive experience so far, and he's coming in from solo queue,"" Echo Fox's ace said about his top lane teammate. ""He barely speaks English, so he has a bit of a tough time learning the game. But we have a translator and he's learning English every single day, so he's [getting better]. Now we're at the point where he actually starts talking to us [in English].""

Froggen has been the anchor for Echo Fox during its resurgence. Riot Games

Froggen doesn't want to get overconfident about his team's chances. Although he knows they're playing well currently, he also divulged that he believes there are a few teams currently playing better than the Foxes in the LCS. His mind-set to overtake those teams is to continue working together as a five-man unit, take every opponent seriously, and diligently work through the remaining schedule.

""I think we just mesh with each other pretty well,"" he said when asked what he believes his team's greatest strength is in its current stage. ""We've been [rapidly] improving since day one. And even though we're almost two months into it now, we've barely had any problems with attitude or anything like that. I feel like we can respect each other and [grow as a team] while doing so.""

The Foxes will look to continue their rapid ascent up the standings this weekend, though they're faced with quite a challenge. They'll take on Team SoloMid (7-5) on Saturday before meeting the undefeated Immortals (12-0) in Sunday's Week 7 finale.",[]
espn.com,,MMA -- Five potential matchups for UFC 200,['Brett Okamoto'],"UFC president Dana White reacts to Conor McGregor's first loss with the company, updates the status of Georges St-Pierre and where McGregor goes from here. (2:55)

LAS VEGAS -- UFC 200 will take place on July 9, 2016, in Las Vegas. That much we know.

Editor's Picks Diaz upsets McGregor by 2nd-round submission In a stunner, Nate Diaz made Conor McGregor eat his words, submitting him by rear-naked choke in Round 2 of their welterweight bout Saturday night in the UFC 196 co-main event.

Tate stuns Holm in 5th; Rousey rematch up next Miesha Tate took the bantamweight championship from Holly Holm with a rear-naked choke submission in the fifth round at UFC 196 and will defend her title against Ronda Rousey, Dana White said. 1 Related

As far as who we'll see on that card? Well, that's the part we're still wondering about. Expectations are high for the landmark event, and the UFC knows it. The promotion will obviously want to deliver big fights, as promised.

But with many of the company's stars either losing or in some sort of career limbo, what's a realistic lineup for UFC 200?

Here's a guess at five potential matchups we could see:

Robbie Lawler has taken over the welterweight division since Georges St-Pierre last stepped in the Octagon on Nov. 16, 2013. Getty Images, AP Photo

Robbie Lawler vs. Georges St-Pierre (welterweight title)

It's been more than two years since St-Pierre vacated the welterweight title and left the sport on top. Now that sport needs him back. His return to the Octagon would be more than strong enough to headline UFC 200. The 34-year-old attended UFC 196 on Saturday and told ESPN.com he has still not made a decision about his fighting future.

UFC president Dana White added, ""have we been talking to Georges? Yes, we have -- but who knows? I honestly, right here, right now, don't know if Georges still wants to fight.""

The ball is in St-Pierre's court. He has never needed to come back. But the feeling is he wants to come back. An attempt to reclaim the title and prove he's still the No. 1 welterweight in the world? Even after all this time off? That's a big-money fight. There's also history between these two, as Lawler watched his close friend and mentor Matt Hughes lose to St-Pierre in 2006 and 2007.

Conor McGregor vs. Jose Aldo II (featherweight title)

Hide Frankie Edgar. Seriously, get him out of here. He's not going to want to see this. Edgar looks like he might be the odd man out of this equation -- again. McGregor is most likely headed back to 145 pounds to defend his title. There are two options for him to fight: Edgar, or Aldo, whom he defeated via 13-second knockout in December.

Here's what McGregor said about it: ""It's hard not to give Aldo another shot; he was 10 years undefeated -- but then again, he pulls out a lot. He doesn't show up. Frankie at least gets in there and competes.""

Each man is deserving. I'd rather see Edgar get the shot. A healthy Aldo had an opportunity to step in for Rafael dos Anjos and fight McGregor at UFC 196 and didn't take it. That counts for something. But McGregor-Aldo II is probably the more marketable matchup. The UFC owes title shots to Edgar and Aldo. The guess is they'll go with Aldo first.

Nate Diaz's victory over Conor McGregor is enough to earn him a second fight against Rafael dos Anjos. Getty Images

Rafael dos Anjos vs. Nate Diaz II (lightweight title)

Based on rankings, Diaz doesn't deserve the next 155-pound championship shot. As big as his win over McGregor was, it was technically a welterweight bout. As a lightweight, Diaz is 2-3 in his past five fights. His stock, however, is at an all-time high coming off this win. A motivated Nate Diaz is the best Nate Diaz, so it wouldn't be shocking to see the UFC feed him another key matchup. And if McGregor does want to move back up and fight for a lightweight title (and he says he does), having either dos Anjos or Diaz as the champion is a great look. He has history with both.

Although dos Anjos smashed Diaz in December 2014, that really wouldn't dampen this matchup too much in July. Again, other lightweights are probably more deserving, but we're talking about UFC 200 here. It demands ""big"" -- and at the moment, Diaz is big.

Forget Ronda: The first Holly Holm-Miesha Tate fight was close enough to warrant a rematch Ed Mulholland for ESPN

Miesha Tate vs. Holly Holm II (women's bantamweight title)

Immediately after UFC 196, White suggested on SportsCenter that Tate's first fight will be against Ronda Rousey. That could very well turn out to be the case, but there's a decent chance it doesn't. White was speaking out of frustration Saturday. He didn't like the UFC risking the Holm vs. Rousey rematch. He knew it would be the biggest rematch in UFC history and wanted Holm to wait for Rousey in order to make it happen.

Once the dust of UFC 196 settles, however, it actually makes a lot of sense for the UFC to run this back. Holm wants it and she's deserving of it. Saturday was her first loss, and she was very much on her way to winning the fight. Ninety more seconds and she would have had her first title defense.

This is a sellable matchup. It allows both women to stay active over the summer, and if Holm wins, hey, the UFC has the title rematch it wanted in the first place. Earlier this year, White said Holm vs. Rousey would be next. He ended up being wrong because we got Holm vs. Tate. Maybe he'll be wrong again this time.

Frankie Edgar wants a shot at Conor McGregor, but he will likely have to wait a bit longer and take other fights. Mitch Viquez/Getty Images

Frankie Edgar vs. Max Holloway

If Edgar doesn't get the featherweight title shot, if it goes to Aldo instead, he'll need to take another fight, right? It's not fair, but that's life, and Edgar is the kind of competitor who takes these kinds of things on the chin.

Another option could be Anderson Silva in some capacity. But if this card features multiple title fights, it might not even need Silva's selling power. Better to save him for another day and, in the meantime, flush out the featherweight division's future. Crown a No. 1 contender and leave no doubt. This matchup makes sense. It would be a stylistically pleasing fight to start off a pay-per-view, and it would be a way to include Edgar in the UFC 200 festivities, even though not in the exact way he wants.",[]

""Go back and look at the films of [the 1983 and 1987 world championships in] Rome and Helsinki,"" he said. ""There were 60,000 people in the stands. They couldn't get 25,000 in Russia [in 2013]. That's the problem with track and field. We're always looking at each other and saying, 'Aren't we great?' No, we're competing against the world, and that's why track is dying.

""We've got to stop looking at each other and saying how great we are. The sport is dying. It's dying.""

Editor's Picks IAAF examining new allegations against Russia The IAAF said Sunday it will investigate claims that Russia is flouting demands for anti-doping reforms as it seeks readmission to world track and field in time for the Rio Olympics.

Lewis spoke at length on several subjects related to his sport, including Sebastian Coe and the IAAF. Now coaching at the University of Houston, Lewis also talked about reasons American men have won few gold medals recently.

""I think it's systemic in America,"" he said. ""No. 1, we no longer have physical education in schools. That's where it starts. A lot of kids are not getting involved. They are not learning to compete. Before, we had P.E. teachers. Now, we have paid coaches.

""No. 2, in non-revenue sports, the coach is now the math teacher, not the P.E. teacher. They don't understand biomechanics and movement. When I get kids in college, I have to fix so much about their running, it's amazing to me. They're teaching things that are incorrect -- the way they're running, what they're doing, all these things that high school coaches don't know.

""Also, I think we're in a culture of mediocrity in America. You don't have to win to get anything now. You go to a high school track meet now, as opposed to 25 years ago, the kids get a medal and they walk around all day with the medal. In our day, I put the medal in my bag and ran to the next event.""

Just look at the long jump.

Carl Lewis, a nine-time Olympic gold medalist, bemoaned the ""dying"" condition of U.S. men's track and field, remarking that entitlement and a lack of grassroots training have contributed to the sport's demise in America. Todd Warshaw/Getty Images

""[It's] the worst event right now. It's awful,"" Lewis said. ""Everyone is like, 'I'm an Olympic champion.' Jesse Owens would have been third in the last Olympics with his personal best 80 years ago.

""They don't know how to jump, and they're not trying to because they're winning the medals anyway. That's the bottom line.""

U.S. gold medalist LaShawn Merritt, a sprinter, did not agree the sport is dying, citing the many meets he competes in around the globe.

""I see a lot of support across the world,'' he said. ""Now, in the U.S., [Lewis] was competing back when it was a little different I guess, but in the world, I still see a lot of people at these meets.''

On the subject of why U.S. women are still performing well at the Olympics, Lewis said, ""Women are still pushing for their identity. ... Women, to me, are tougher. In training and working, they're ready to do it. They feel the struggle more. I think the guys have gotten settled to America was so great all those years. Remember, 25 years ago, Evelyn Ashford had to fight through the East Germans and Russians. The women were the ones getting beat, and the men were dominating. Now, it's flopped because the women fought their way to the top.""

U.S. sprinter and Olympic hopeful English Gardner said she doesn't think the sport is dying, but that it needs more attention.

""I think it doesn't have as much awareness as it used to,'' Gardner said. ""What made me fall in love with the sport was meeting Gail Devers and actually getting to see a legend, being able to touch a legend. Hearing her stories and being able to learn something from that. That's what the sport needs. The sport just needs more awareness for kids.

""I don't see it dying. This sport was created many, many years before there [were] sponsorships, before there [were] meets, before there was a USATF. The ancient Greeks used to do it. It's a test of human strength. This sport can never die. But it also can always get more awareness.''",[]

Team: Ehome

Update: Ehome will drop both Cty and kaka in a startling roster shakeup, while Fenir will join Ehome according to LiquidDota.

Analysis: Another bombshell dropped as roster shakeups across the Dota 2 landscape come into focus. Fenrir is a very capable support player who will now have to find his way on a different team. Ehome will participate in the upcoming ESL One Manila 2016 LAN Finals, being played April 22-24 in Manila, the Philippines.

IceIceIce: More Shanghai fallout as IceIceIce moves to new team

Name: Koh ""IceIceIce"" Pei Xiang

Team: Ehome

Update: In what appears to be even more fallout from The Shanghai Major FInals, IceIceIce will join Ehome's DOTA2 roster according to LiquidDota.

Analysis: Shocking news as Ehome will release both Cty and kaka from the team. Ehome was one of the odds on favorites to win The Shanghai Major, but couldn't get past Alliance in the second round of the bottom bracket tying with four other teams for 9th place. IceIceIce is a high-risk, high reward type of player that likes to push offlane. Ehome and IceIceIce will play in the ESL One Manila 2016 LAN Finals on April 22-24 in Manila, Philippines.

Cty: Joins Ehome exodus following disappointing performance at The Shanghai Major

Name: Tian ""Cty"" Yu Chen

Team: N/A

Update: Cty was let go by Ehome following a disappointing run during The Shanghai Major, LiquidDota reports.

Analysis: In an alarming move, Ehome opted to making sweeping changes after The Shanghai Major, a tournament in which the odds on favorites were unable to make it into the top eight. While inevitably, someone on Ehome had to take the fall for their dismal performance, it's unclear why the Chinese team opted to rid themselves of Cty, who contributed nearly 50 kills during the tournament and is widely considered one of the premiere carries within the sport. Cty should have no shortage of suitors when he eventually decides to rejoin the scene.

Kaka: Released by Ehome

Name: Hu ""Kaka"" Liangzhi

Team: N/A

Update: Kaka was released by Ehome, according to LiquidDota .

Analysis: While Cty's release, one of a handful of surprising moves made by Ehome following their unsuccessful run during The Shanghai Major, was a bit perplexing, Kaka's release seems a bit more understandable considering his ugly performance during Ehome's elimination match against Alliance, in which he posted a 1/7/8 KDA on Bane. After spending the last six months with Ehome, helping the club take home first place finishes at the Dota 2 Radiant and Dire Cup 2015, the Shanghai Dota 2 Open as well as the MarsTV Dota 2 League Winter 2015, the former HyperGlory support will try to catch on with another club in the coming weeks.

Analysis: Rumors had been circulating for weeks that Team Empire was looking to make a roster shakeup -- ones that only seemed to intensify after XBOCT was released. As of now, it appears as if the Korean offlaner will remain with the club, although the alarmingly small amount of information surronding his presence, or lack thereof, at the upcoming LAN event isn't necessarily a vote of confidence by the team.

While Empire was able to qualify for the ESL One Manila, they struggled during the European qualifications for the Shanghai Major, winning just three of their eight playoff games. With the Dota Pit 4 Finals looming, Team Empire was forced to put together a makeshift roster, with former Power Rangers carry, fn, taking over for XBOCT.

w33: Leads all players in kills as Team Secret wins The Shanghai Major

Name: Aliwi ""w33"" Omar

Team: Team Secret

Update: w33 used four different heroes in Team Secret's 3-1 win over Liquid in The Shanghai Major Finals capturing the $1,100,000 prize.

Analysis: w33 was the decisive force, leading all players in kills with a KDA of 40/10/38. In Game One w33, as Slark in the mid lane, used Pounce expertly to leash enemy players, holding them in place for team ganks. In Game Two, w33 used Death Prophet, again holding down mid, finishing with a KDA 13/6/7. However it was Game Three that will stand out in the minds of fans everywhere. In one of the most epic stands in the tournament, w33 as Invoker, stood his ground and slaughtered four players in the span of 40 seconds. Unleashing Cold snap with Tornado, the level 25 Invoker was simply too much and Liquid could do nothing but surrender.

Game Four wasn't much of a game, with Liquid still feeling the effects of w33's damage during the last team fight. w33 and Team Secret would go on to win The Shanghai Major Finals, 26-3 in a 25-minute rout.

Puppey: Fantastic in tournament finals at The Shanghai Major

Name: Clement ""Puppey"" Ivanov

Team: Team Secret

Update: Puppey finished the tournament on a high note, sporting a 20/13/50 KDA in Team Secret's 3-1 over Liquid in The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: Puppey was nearly omnipresent in his vision and play calling ability throughout this match. In Game One Puppey would be the shot caller playing Enchantress to a KDA of 8/1/12. He used her abilities to slow her opponents using Untouchable, one of the longest slows of any heroes. Puppey roamed lane to lane dealing damage to anybody in his path. Game Two would see Puppey choose Winter Wyvern, trying to Soar and get to team ganks quickly. It wasn't to be as Liquid countered well and Puppey could only get to a 2/6/10 KDA.

However, in what turned out to be the decisive and soul crushing Game Three for Liquid, Puppey turned to Doom and tied teammate MiSeRy for the game lead in assists with 19. Doom is particularly fearsome while gaining abilities not needing to level up but instead simply draining creeps and enemies. Game Four seemed to have already been decided, as Puppey, using Doom once again, thumped Liquid with a KDA of 20/13/50. The fourth game lasted a mere 25-minutes as Team Secret took home the $1,100,000 prize as The Shanghai Major Champions.

EternaLEnVy: Outstanding performance results in Shanghai Major win

Name: Jacky ""EternaLEnVy"" Mao

Team: Team Secret

Update: EternaLEnVy was outstanding in Team Secret's Shanghai Major tournament win with a 37/11/34 KDA.

Analysis: EternaLEnVy rose to level 25 in just about record time in Team Secret's Game One win, using Slark to decimate enemies. He dealt 31,500 in hero damage directly resulting in 11 kills. Game Two was an aberration for Secret, taking a surprising 25-30 loss. In Game Two, EternaLEnVy drafted Ursa in an attempt to support w33 playing Death Prophet. However, the Liquid tandem of Invoker and Beastmaster proved too much. Game Three would go down as epic, with Team Secret winning 35-19.

In that game, EternaLEnVy would choose Clinkz, using his ranged and stealth attacks to get the jump on Liquid in the bottom lane. EternaLEnVy was superior in the middle portion of Game Three killing off eight members of Liquid in a 10-minute period. EternaLEnVy would lead all players with nine kills in Team Secret's Game Four win taking The Shanghai Major crown and the $1,100,000 prize.

MiSeRy: Lends helping hand in Team Secret's 3-1 win in The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Rasmus ""MiSeRy"" Filipsen

Team: Team Secret

Update: MiSeRy played the support role well, performing to a 21/15/56 KDA in Team Secert's 3-1 championship win at The Shanghai Major.

Analysis: MiSeRy stayed home in the bottom lane using Tidehunter in Game One, assisting in 18 kills with a KDA of 6/4/18. MiSeRy did lead his team in Game Two in assists with 12, but Team Secret would lose this game 31-25 in just over 50 minutes. Game Three was for all intents and purposes the decisive game of the match.

MiSeRy drafted Nature's Prophet again holding down the bottom lane from any Liquid rushes. MiSeRy was irreplaceable in the most important team fight of the tournament assisting Invoker, played by w33, in four kills which secured a Game Three win. In Game Four, Team Liquid looked and played mentally exhausted giving Team Secret and MiSeRy all they needed as MiSeRy slashed out to a 7/1/7 KDA and a Team Secret championship at The Shanghai Major.

MATUMBAMAN: Positive KDA not enough in series loss to Team Secret

Name: Lasse ""MATUMBAMAN"" Urpalainen

Team: Team Liquid

Update: MATUMBAMAN was the lone bright spot in an otherwise ugly performance by Team Liquid during The Shanghai Major Finals. Through four games, MATUMBAMAN put together a 27/19/22 KDA.

Analysis: Team Liquid attempted to prioritize building FATA throughout the series, but it was actually MATUMBAMAN who was the star of the series, particularly in Game Two. While FATA was able to deal large amounts of damage to Team Secret, it was MATUMBAMAN who came in to clean things up, using Lycan to rack up 14 total kills and deal the most hero damage (20,217) in the game.

While his performance fell off in Games Three and Four, MATUMBAMAN was the only player on Team Liquid who could consistently deal damage to his opponents, and he was able to do it with a litany of heroes, making him arguably more valuable than FATA in future tournaments.

KuroKy: Ugly KDA numbers culminate in Shanghai Finals loss

Name: Kuro ""KuroKy"" Salehi Takhasomi

Team: Team Liquid

Update: KuroKy struggled mightily during Team Liquid's series loss to Team Secret at The Shanghai Major Finals, submitting a 4/37/23 series KDA.

Analysis: A support's KDA will never tend to be the best figure during a series loss, but KuroKy had a hard time staying alive during the series. While he was able to put together some impressive healing performances, particularly in Game Two, where he recorded a team-high 4,358 figure, he continually found himself in poor positions becoming food for a hungry Team Secret.

While Team Liquid should take solace in the fact that they did make it to the final match-up at The Shanghai Major, it certainly wasn't thanks to KuroKy, who stumbled through much of the group stage portion of the event as well.

FATA: Unable to carry team to Shanghai series victory

Name: Adrian ""FATA"" Trinks

Team: Team Liquid

Update: FATA posted a 23/22/26 series KDA during Team Liquid's Shanghai Major Finals loss to Team Secret.

Analysis: FATA lived, but mostly died with his hero of choice, Invoker. In Game One, FATA opted to use Invoker, but never really became the serious threat Team Liquid was hoping for, putting forth the second lowest hero damage total on the team. The solo mid doubled down on the decision in Game Two, opting to use Invoker once again. This time, though, FATA excelled, racking up kills and assists while pulverizing Team Secret's mistakes to the tune of a 10/4/14 KDA.

Game Three found FATA on a different hero, the Outworld Devourer, and while he was able to put up hefty KDA numbers, his team was unable to prioritize a second heavy, resulting in the mid accounting for nearly half of the teams kills. And in what quickly became a joke of a Game Four, MATA and the rest of Team Liquid succumbed to an unrelenting w33, as Team Secret won the game in just over 25 minutes, relegating Team Liquid to a second place finish at The Shanghai Major tournament.

The trend continued into Game 2, as SumaiL helped EG seal the series, posting an 8/1/8 KDA while dealing a huge amount of damage (14,000).

Name: Pyo ""MP"" No-a

Team: MVP Phoenix

Update: MP finished with a KDA of 7/11/12 as MVP Phoenix fell 2-0 to Evil Geniuses in the lower bracket of the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: MP served as the lone bright spot for MVP Phoenix during its Game 1 loss against Evil Geniuses. MP finished with a 4/4/6 KDA while playing a safe lane Spectre. He posted his team's highest gold total (15,400) but couldn't do enough to help MVP Phoenix deal with EG. In Game 2, MP fell off a bit, dropping his KDA down to 3/7/6.

Arteezy stacked up his gold, racking up the most in the game with 19,800, and also tied for the most damage in the game at 14,700.

Like many of his teammates in Game 2, Arteezy got his Game 1 pick, Ursa, back and excelled, putting together a KDA of 10/2/4 while racking up 21,600 gold.

DkPhobos: Takes care of Vici Gaming in win

Name: Alexander ""DkPhobos"" Kucheria

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update: DK led his team to victory over Vici Gaming on Wednesday, posting a KDA of 8/2/11.

Analysis: DK, playing the offlane Beastmaster, had a very impressive match for an offlaner. DK led all players with eight kills while also assisting in another 11 kills .DK also took over as the leading pusher as he dealt over 2000 damage to enemy towers.

God: Asserts dominance over Vici Gaming

Name: Sergey ""God"" Bragin

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update: God smites Vici Gaming during their Wednesday series win, posting an impressive KDA of 7/1/22.

Analysis: God playing the mid lane Zeus, was an ever present nuisance for VG as his global prowess led to problems in engagements. God was tied for second in total kills with seven, while leading all players in the game with 22 assists. God was apart of 29 of 32 total kills of VP in the game, leading to an impressive hero damage total of over 17,000.

fng: Helps team more than triple opponents' kill total in win

Name: Artsiom ""fng"" Barshack

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update: fng played a flawless game against Vici Gaming on Wednesday, ending with a KDA of 7/0/16.

Analysis: Playing the jungling Enchantress, fng played a great, calculated game, ending the game with zero deaths in a kill-heavy match. fng was tied for second in total kills with seven, while also assisting in another 16. FNG also provided a nice pushing boost for VP, dealing over 2000 damage to enemy towers.

Handsken: Aids in Wednesday win

Name: Simon ""Handsken"" Haag

Team: compLexity Gaming

Update: Handsken played a fantastic support game in Complexity's series win over Spirit, putting up a KDA of 4/1/19.

Analysis: Handsken, playing the support Lich, played a nearly ideal game for any support player, tallying 19 assists while only dying once. Handsken spent much of his time middle with Tiny to secure his midlaners farm. Being the good support that he is, Handsken purchased a Urn of Shadows to heal his allies after fights.

Limmp: Carries team to win Wednesday

Name: Linus ""Limmp"" Blomdin

Team: compLexity Gaming

Update: Limmp carried his team to a match victory with a KDA of 12/1/15 during Wednesday's win over Team Spirit.

Analysis: Limmp put on a show in his match against Team Spirit. Playing the Tiny mid, he racked up the most kills in the match (12), while also assisting in another 15 kills. Limmp was far and away the biggest damage dealer in the game, tallying over 16,000. Limmp carried the momentum from a strong laning phase, using his gold to purchase a Blink Dagger to gank around the map utilizing his strong burst damage. Throughout Limp's active match, he still only died a single time.

Miracle: Best of worst in OG's 1-2 loss to Team Secret

Name: Amer ""Miracle"" Barqawi

Team: OG

Update: Miracle was a pleasant surprise in a crushing loss, posting a 12/6/9 KDA in a first round upper bracket match at The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: Miracle played steady amongst an onslaught that saw his teammates stumble throughout the match. OG won the first game despite having fewer kills than Team Secret, but the big story was Miracle. Miracle rushed opponent towers, playing Lone Druid, destroying six towers and four barracks for a total of 18,438 in damage. The rest of OG ran interference for Miracle allowing him to decimate opponent structures in the win. In Game Two, using Slark, Miracle lead the team in kills (5), gold (21,400) and tower damage (1,400).

It was a decent game for Miracle, but Team Secret was too much and they dropped the game. If an MVP could be given to the player on the losing side, Miracle would have earned it. With the first ever Terrorblade sighting in The Shanghai Major Finals, Miracle sliced and diced his way to a 5/0/1 KDA racking up even more hero and tower damage with 4,300 and 3,000 respectfully. Miracle constantly finds ways to keep his KDA numbers up and seems to be a solid player in every venue.

Fly-Simba-: Swatted in OG's 1-2 loss to Team Secret

Name: Tai ""Fly-Simba-"" Aizik

Team: OG

Update: Fly-Simba had perhaps his worst match of the year churning out a 3/16/13 KDA in their 1-2 loss to Team Secret in upper bracket play at The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: Fly-Simba went with Pugna, who had only been chosen once before in this tournament. Seems there was a reason players shied away from Pugna as Fly-Simba was shut out in the kills department with a 0/3/6 KDA. However, Pugna did a decent job of stopping any mid lane pushes using Nether Ward and Decrepify in an attempt to allow his team to attack slowed heroes. OG won the first game, having less kills, 13 to 17. In another interesting pick in Game Two, Fly-Simba selected Winter Wyvern who in the finals round was 0-2.

Fly-Simba would attempt to rotate and gank but ended up on the negative side of the KDA spectrum going 2/9/2 for the game. In reality it was more of the same for Fly-Simba, going 1/4/5 playing the Lion in the bottom safe. Lion was commendable in stopping two bottom lane pushes, but couldn't rotate fast enough to mid or top lane and was often late to the fray. This lateness cost him as OG fell in Game Three and the match.

EternaLEnVy: After slow start, cleans up in 2-1 win over OG

Name: Jacky ""EternaLEnVy"" Mao

Team: Team Secret

Update: EternaLEnVy surged towards the end of the match finishing with a 13/5/15 KDA in their 2-1 win over OG at The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: Roaming with Weaver, EternaLEnVy was not effective in Game One staggering to a 2/3/8 KDA. But things turned around starting in Game Two with EternaLEnVy choosing the Drow Ranger. As the Ranger, EternaLEnVy buffed speed, agility and damage using ranged attacks on his way to a 6/1/4 KDA and a team win. In what is seemingly turning into a habit after a win, EternaLEnVy picked Drow Ranger and played another good game, racking up a KDA of 5/1/3. EternaLEnVy posted a triple-kill in support of Outworld Devourer in the Ancient rush procuring a Team Secret win.

w33: Lethal in Team Secret's 2-1 win over OG at The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Aliwi ""w33"" Omar

Team: Team Secret

Update: w33 continued to rank as one of the top players in the tournament with a 22/5/18 KDA in a first round victory at The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: w33 started off slow in the match, playing Ember Spirit to a 4/2/6 KDA in a very quick Team Secret loss. OG's Moonmeander kept the mid lane in check, pitting his Tidehunter against w33. In Game Two, w33 came back with revenge on his mind, selecting Outworld Devourer to do nothing but deal damage. With 12,900 in hero damage w33 lead all players in the category.

He rotated well between the mid and top lanes, culminating in a 1:13 teamfight, where he picked up two kills in the win. w33 went back to the well, acquiring Outworld Devourer for Game Three and the results were the same. w33 went for a 7/0/5 KDA, once again leading all players in kills, securing a match win for Team Secret.

MiSeRy: Leads all players in assists in Team Secret's 2-1 win over OG

Name: Rasmus ""MiSeRy"" Filipsen

Team: Team Secret

Update: MiSeRy ran amok pulling a 8/12/32 KDA in Team Secret's 2-1 win over OG in the first round of upper bracket play at The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: MiSeRy had a hand in over half of the total kills inflicted upon OG with 32 in this three game thriller. In Team Secret's Game One loss, MiSeRy played Nature's Prophet stuffing numerous top lane rushes, ending Game One win with a KDA of 2/4/8. Also of note in Game One, MiSeRy took out three towers, causing the most damage to towers and structures with 5,313. Sticking with Nature's Prophet in Game Two, MiSeRy lead all players in the game with 20 assists doing 10,200 in hero damage and 4,900 in tower damage.

MiSeRy was great in the late stages of the game coupling Aghanim's Scepter with his Wrath of Nature ability. This would prove devastating in the team fight during the rush at the Ancient. MiSeRy gave ample support to Outworld Devourer, played by w33, to the tune of one kill and eight assists in the final battle of Game Two. MiSeRy was anti-climactic in Game Three playing Beastmaster crawling to a 1/5/4 KDA in a Game Three Team Secret win.

Puppey: Advances to second round with 2-1 over Team OG

Name: Clement ""Puppey"" Ivanov

Team: Team Secret

Update: While Looper's 3/2/10 KDA may not raise any eyebrows, his impact on RNG's win over Ever cannot be overstated.

Analysis: Puppey played a strategically sound match, making good use of a rotating early rush, netting a kill and two assists by the four-minute mark in Game One as Earthshaker. After a loss in Game One, Team Secret went with an all-ranged line up with Puppey choosing to play Enigma. The plan worked, as Enigma played a huge part in taking out OG towers early en route to a 29-11 Game Two win.

Game Three would see a lot of slow play with the action not really starting until 19 minutes in. Puppey had a disappointing last game, getting zero kills but leading his team in assists with six in their 16-9 game and match win. Not a great match for Puppey, but enough to help get this win. Team Secret will take on Evil Geniuses in Round Two.

Team: Alliance

Update: Akke posted an 11/2/7 KDA to help Alliance to a 1-0 series win over EHOME in the lower bracket of the Shanghai Major.

Name: Jerry ""EGM"" Lundkvist

Team: Alliance

Analysis: EGM chose Io, rotating between the mid lane and the jungle, to assist Alliance's 1-0 win over EHOME in the lower bracket of the Shanghai Major. He earned a 2/3/19 KDA with the supportive hero, best demonstrated by his incredible healing (5,100).

Xiao2le: Up to challenge in NewBee's 1-0 win over CDEC

Name: Meng ""Xiao2le"" Lei

Team: NewBee

Update: Xiao2le played a well-rounded match going 9/4/14 KDA in their 1-0 win over CDEC at The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: Xiao2le played Doom using Devour, consuming creeps by the dozens gaining their abilities and bonus gold. Maxing out Scorched Earth by level seven allowed Xiao2le to damage enemies, create lanes for his team to escape and gave him a speed bonus with which he could attack or escape. Coming on a little late, but perhaps just in time, Xiao2le racked up five kills in the middle portion of this match, harassing CDEC at the same time. This allowed Phantom lancer to farm, gaining abilities. Xiao2le was third of all players in assists with three and fifth in gold earned with 28,700.

Mu: Pole to pole in NewBee's 1-0 win over CDEC

Name: Zhang ""Mu"" Pan

Team: NewBee

Update: Mu, playing Batrider, flew his way to a 1/5/22 KDA in their BO1 win over CDEC in a bottom bracket match win at The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: Mu was unrivaled as Batrider in his ability to quickly get to various spots on the map, assisting in kills. Batrider appeared to have stalked both Enchantress (Q) and Weaver (Agressif) racking up six kill assists on each. On an amazing note, Mu's buffing of Batrider's speed and agility allowed him to get in on kills on completely opposite sides of the map.

In a span of just over one minute Batrider got on assist at the top of CDEC's base and then sped down to bottom lane and picked up two more assists! Batrider's ability to rotate was the reason Mu lead all players with 22 assists. Mu is 46/37/68 KDA in his last nine games.

Hao: Lances through CDEC in 1-0 victory

Name: Chen ""Hao"" Zhihao

Team: NewBee

Update: Hao was impressive, amassing a 16/4/12 KDA in NewBee's 1-0 win over CDEC in a bottom bracket match of The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: Of Hao's 16 kills playing Phantom Lancer, 13 of them were by auto attack. A very impressive feat. Hao drew first blood, killing Beastmaster (Xz) at the 2:29 mark of the match, setting the tone. But what clearly set Hao apart from the rest of the players in this match was his farming, which netted him 46,879 gold, 15,000 more than the next player. His ability to buy items went unmatched and Hao had the advantage the entire match. Hao ended the match with a triple kill that ended any defense CDEC could mount. Hao has a 60/35/63 KDA in The Shanghai Major.

Arteezy: Imposes will against FNATIC

Name: Artour ""Arteezy"" Babaev

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: Arteezy made a statement during Evil Geniuses 2-0 win over FNATIC in Round 1 of the upper bracket at The Shanghai Major FInals. He had an 18/4/15 KDA and got rich in the process.

Analysis: Arteezy dominated Game One against FNATIC. In a safe lane, Arteezy opted for Seven and posted a 5/0/7 KDA. He dealt the second most damage on his team at 7,700. Arteezy earned an impressive 30,300 gold, bolstering his ability to dismantle FNATIC and help Evil Geniuses nab a 1-0 lead. Arteezy couldn't follow up his Game One performance with another flawless KDA, but he still managed a strong showing, finishing with 13/4/8 KDA.

Arteezy selected Clinkz in Game Two, and it was the right choice. Arteezy once again amassed a preposterous amount of gold (22,000, nearly 5,000 more than anybody else) and led his team in damage with 14,000. Evil Geniuses made short work of FNATIC with a 2-0 series win.

Fear: Dominate performance for Evil Geniuses against FNATIC

Name: Clinton ""Fear"" Loomis

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: Fear struck fear in FNATIC, posting an 18/2/15 KDA in Evil Geniuses 2-0 series win in Round 1 of the upper bracket at the Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: Fear rotated between the mid lane and the jungle with Bounty Hunter in Game One against FNATIC. The result was a 8/1/7 KDA and a strong 7,000 damage dealt. Fear had his Bounty Hunter banned by FNATIC in Game Two, but still demonstrated excellence on Mirana, recording a 10/1/8 KDA as Evil Geniuses took a clean 2-0 series win. Fear dealt 9,400 damage while healing teammates for 1,400.

UNiVeRse: Almost unkillable against FNATIC

Name: Saahil ""UNiVeRse"" Arora

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: UNiVeRse had a 14/1/29 KDA against FNATIC as Evil Geniuses earned a 2-0 series in Round 1 of the upper bracket in the Shanghai Major.

The unkillable UNiVeRse also healed teammates for 1,400. UNiVeRse's perfect streak ended in Game Two, as the mid laner died once en route to a 10/1/15 KDA. UNiVeRse racked up 17,500 god and bruised FNATIC for 9,700 damage.

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: Suma1L went 15/6/33 as Evil Geniuses grabbed a 2-0 series win against FNATIC in Round 1 of the upper bracket at The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: Suma1L dominated the mid lane with Nyx Assassin in Game One against FNATIC. Suma1L compiled a 7/2/11 KDA, leading Evil Geniuses in damage with 8,300. Suma1L then switched to a Batrider in Game Two after FNATIC banned Nyx Assassin. The result? Suma1L crushed it again. He finished Game Two with a 8/4/22 KDA, dealing an impressive 10,400 damage.

Name: Peter ""(ppd) Peterpandam"" Dager

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: Peterpandam went 2/7/32 as Evil Geniuses defeated FNATIC 2-0 in Round 1 in upper bracket play at The Shanghai Major Finals.

His safe lane play led to a 1/4/11 KDA, and more importantly, a series-opening win for EG. Peterpandam dished out 1,600 worth of heals. Peterpandam served as his team's sacrificial lamb, dying to set up more plays for the rest of the team.

It's hard to argue with the end result, as Evil Geniuses went on to a 36-minute victory. Peterpandam kept producing in Game Two, using a 1/3/21 KDA as Vengeful Spirit to help Evil Geniuses close out the series 2-0. Peterpandam once again healed teammates, rejuvenating allies for 1,300 points.

MARCH 2, 2016

Xz: Gritty effort not enough as CDEC loses 0-1 at The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Chen ""Xz"" Zezhi

Team: CDEC Gaming

Update: Xz struggled to a 1/6/10 KDA in CDEC's 0-1 loss to NewBee in a bottom bracket match at the The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: Xz selected Beastmaster in an attempt to hold down the bottom lane. He was caught early however, by Phantom Lancer (Hao) and Rubick (ChuaN) in a quick rush taking place at 2:29 for first death. After being killed three times, Xz got his first kill at the 29:26 mark. Xz was essentially playing the role of scout sending out his Call of The Wild to view the battlefield.

He used his vision in an attempt to blind Newbee by destroying five Observation Wards and two Sentry Wards. This dual role of gaining vision and taking away vision didn't produce good KDA numbers that some people would like to see. CDEC will finish The Shanghai Major tied for 13th.

Agressif: Plays well in 0-1 loss to NewBee in The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Sun ""Agressif"" Zheng

Team: CDEC Gaming

Update: Agressif played his way to a 10/6/9 KDA as Weaver in CDEC's 0-1 bottom bracket loss to Newbee at The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: Agressif played Weaver mostly in the top lane farming furiously to advance levels. The farming paid off as Weaver did in fact hit level 25, farming 30,286 of the 31,500 total gold acquired. Along with the gold, Agressif added 413 Last Hits to go along with 13 denies. Seven of Weaver's 10 kills were committed before the 48 minute mark in this marathon of a game which lasted 1:02:17. Agressif was the last man standing before the onslaught to the Ancient by Newbee, but went down swinging taking Phoenix (le) with him. CDEC finishes The Shanghai Major tied for 13th.

Jeyo: Valiant in loss to Ehome

Name: Jio ""Jeyo"" Madayag

Team: Team Archon

Update: Jeyo went 2/4/5 KDA in Archon's 0-1 loss to Ehome in the first round of bottom bracket play in The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: Jeyo picked Slark in hopes of utilizing Essence Shift in order to drain enemy heroes abilities and transform them into agility. Unfortunately, Jeyo didn't have enough time to level up as the match lasted just under 28 minutes. On the positive, Jeyo did lead Archon in Last Hits and hero damage dealt with 6,000. Archon exits the tournament tied for 13th.

Team: Ehome

Analysis: kaka, playing Phoenix in the bottom lane, pushed early into Archon's territory using Sun Ray to good effect. kaka played Phoenix to the meta starting out with two iron branches, Tango and Clarity. He used these items well early, farming and leveling quickly. In a great tactical stroke, during the pivotal 5-vs-5 battle that would eventually decide the game, kaka used Phoenix's Supernova that helped kill all five members of Archon at 26:47.

Name: Yang ""eLeVeN"" Wei Ren

Team: Ehome

Update: eLeVeN lead all players in the match in assists showing a 4/2/16 KDA in Ehome's 1-0 bottom bracket win over Archon in The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: eLeVeN picked Tidehunter as Ehome's first selection in an attempt to use its brute melee strength in holding down mid lane. Playing Tidehunter to meta perfection, starting with Tango and Clarity, eLeVeN could not be pushed out of mid. Maxing out Anchor Smash by level six, Tidehunter started to push mid lane with Outworld Devourer (oldchicken) to devastating effect. Only 10 of the 38 kills in this match took place on Ehome's side of the map. eLeVeN is 50/80/113 in his last 12 games.

oldchicken: Another solid match at The Shanghai Major

Name: Wang ""oldchicken"" Zhiyong

Team: Ehome

Update: oldchicken was on his game once again with a 7/3/11 KDA in Ehome's 1-0 victory over Archon in bottom bracket play at The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: Leveling to 16, oldchicken played Outworld Devourer in the bottom lane getting in on 62 percent of Ehome's kills. The defining moment in the match for oldchickeen occured at the 27:14 mark when an epic 5-vs-5 took place just outside the bottom steps on Archon's base. After an initial rush by Ursa (Cty), oldchicken went to work unleashing Arcane Orb, allowing him to kill the Enchantress, adding an assist on Beastmaster. The rush to the Ancient was on and Ehome went on to win 29-9.

Cty: Bearish in Ehome's 1-0 victory in bottom bracket play at The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Tian ""Cty"" Yu Chen

Team: Ehome

Update: Cty swiped and clawed his way to a 10/1/5 KDA in Ehome's 1-0 win over Archon in the first round of bottom bracket play at The Shanghai Major Finals on Wednesday.

Analysis: Cty lead all players with 10 kills, farming at first and then rotating down to mid lane to engage Archon. As Ursa, Cty maxed out Fury Swipes by level seven and Overpower by 12. Roaming with Tusk (LaNm) at mid lane, Ursa caused damage to heroes and towers alike. With three multi-kills, three tower kills, and two Roshan kills, Cty wielded Ursa's claws to a solid Ehome victory. Cty is 45/20/54 in his seven games at The Shanghai Major.

MMY!: Holds own in LGD's 0-2 loss to MVP Phoenix at The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Lei ""MMY!"" Zengrong

Team: LGD Gaming

Update: MMY! played a hard fought match posting a 3/9/12 KDA in 0-2 loss to MVP Phoenix at The Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: Nothing really went right for LGD or MMY! in this match. MMY! chose Disruptor as his team's first pick to the surprise of fans and pundits. MMY! pulled one over on them posting a 2/3/1 KDA which accounted for 75 percent of LGD's kills in Game One. However, It wasn't enough as LGD lost Game One 4-18.

Game Two was a little better as MMY! chose Earth Spirit, opting to play him in the mid lane. Although the kills weren't there, he did manage 11 assists on his way to a 1/6/11 KDA in Game Two. MMY! is 24/44/87 in his last 10 games.

Maybe: Lone bright spot in LGD's 0-2 loss to MVP Phoenix

Name: Yao ""Maybe"" Lu

Team: LGD Gaming

Update: While not really lucky, Maybe was sevens across the board with a 7/7/7 KDA in LGD's 0-2 loss to MVP Phoenix in the opening round of The Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: Overall a miserable day for LGD, Maybe salvaged a decent KDA considering the overall direction of the match. In Game One, Maybe took Razor playing the mid lane. He assisted in three of the four total kills LGD managed against MVP Phoenix. Game One lasted a mere 23 minutes and 16 seconds in the loss for LGD.

Game Two was much better for Maybe, but not LGD, as Maybe mounted a KDA of 7/2/4. Using Ursa in the mid lane, Maybe attempted to hold back MVP Phoenix's mid lane pushes by getting two kills, but was overwhelmed, losing the match and the game. Maybe is 60/37/74 KDA at The Shanghai Major.

FoREV: Mobility the key in MVP Phoenix's 2-0 win over LGD

Name: Lee ""FoREV"" Sang-don

Team: MVP Phoenix

Update: FoREV was superb, pushing to a 12/2/21 KDA in MVP Phoenix's 2-0 win over LGD in the first round of The Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: FoREV, teleported his way to zero deaths, playing to a 5/0/8 KDA in Game One of the match. Playing Nature's Prophet in the top lane, FoREV was a tower killing machine dealing 6,100 in damage, taking out two towers, three barracks and a Roshan while gaining an Aegis (which he wouldn't need). As a result Game One went to MVP Phoenix.

In a hero not used very often, Bristleback was FoREV's choice for Game Two. Bristleback would net a KDA of 7/2/13 for FoREV, as MVP Phoenix would go on to win Game Two and the match. FoREV is 30/9/62 KDA combined in matches at The Shanghai Major.

MP: All-around play propels MVP Phoenix to 2-0 win over LGD

Name: Pyo ""MP"" No-a

Team: MVP Phoenix

Update: MP played firm, collecting a 10/3/12 KDA in MVP Phoenix's 2-0 win over LGD in the opening round of The Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: MP, playing the bottom lane Outworld Devourer in Game One, lead all players with six kills, zero deaths and four assists. He played a multi-faceted damaging role doing 8,300 hero damage and 3,300 tower damage in an 18-4 Game One drubbing of LGD. A change of hero and lane in Game Two would affect MP's overall KDA to the tune of 4/3/8.

Playing Juggernaut, MP lost the head-to-head battle with LGD's Ursula (Maybe), being killed three times, but won the game destroying three towers, one barrack and a Roshan. MP is 33/7/52 KDA in all matches in The Shanghai Major.

QO: Unshakable in first round win at The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Kim ""QO"" Seon-yeop

Team: MVP Phoenix

Update: QO continued to impress going 10/4/15 in MVP Phoenix's win over LGD in the first round of The Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: Not banning Ember Spirit was a mistake by LGD as QO was a hero-damaging machine, leading his team with 9,100 earning a 1/1/11 KDA. QO played mid lane so effectively that only five of the 22 total kills in this game took place on MVP Phoenix's side of the map. Game Two was a little more challenging, but QO, playing Invoker devastated LGD to the tune of a 9/3/14 KDA. As the top leveler, QO was able to max out Wex by level 12, using the speed and agility bonus to dash in and out attacking his opponents.

Of particular attack value to QO was his ability, Tornado, which he used expertly to suspend LGD heroes in the air as his teammates hit them with attacks. MVP Phoenix is 6-0 at The Shanghai Major with QO's KDA of 47/8/53 being a big reason.

AdmiralBulldog: Bite not big enough as Alliance drops finals opener to Team Liquid

Name: Henrik ""AdmiralBulldog"" Ahnberg

Team: Alliance

Update: AdmiralBulldog had more deaths than kills for the first time in The Shanghai Major, posting a 12/15/27 KDA in a losing effort against Team Liquid on Tuesday.

Analysis: AdmiralBulldog, playing in the top lane with Lone Druid in Game One, missed out on team fight opportunities participating in only 31 percent of Alliance's kills. His KDA of 2/6/2 ranked last in terms of total kills. Even with his Spirit Bear maxed out by level seven, it simply wasn't enough to offset Team Liquid's URSA (MATUMBAMAN) who killed AdmiralBulldog twice mid lane. Game Two was much more to AdmiralBulldog's liking, finishing with a KDA of 5/3/18 using Beastmaster. Beastmaster was a particular anathema to Necrophos (MATUMBAMAN) killing him twice with five assists in and around the bottom lane.

AdmiralBulldog was an all-around player in Game Two doing 8,900 hero damage and 4,800 in tower damage in securing a Game Two Alliance win. AdmiralBulldog would look to repeat his numbers from Game Two and hopefully a win as he chose Beastmaster again for Game Three. However, that contest didn't go Alliance's way as they lost 15-33, with AdmiralBulldog posting a 5/6/7 KDA.

s4: Leading team in kills not enough to stave off Team Liquid

Name: Gustav ""s4"" Magnusson

Team: Alliance

Update: s4 played to a KDA of 16/17/22, but it wasn't enough as Alliance drops the first match of The Shanghai Major Finals.

Analysis: s4, the mid laner for Alliance, used the Queen of Pain in Game One, finishing with a KDA of 6/4/3. s4 was the top leveler at 18 and didn't get the support needed to mount an effective offense or defense. In fact, in this Game One loss, Alliance never breached the steps of Team Liquid's base. In Game Two, s4 would see another positive KDA with 7/6/13 using Batrider to assist in team fights and farm gaining 21,900 gold.

s4's ability to rotate quickly while using the Firefly ability was crucial in forcing a Game Three.s4, using Puck, struggled along with the rest of the team posting a 3/7/6 KDA in Game Three. Although those numbers look bad, s4 did the best he could farming, collecting 17,200 gold (most on team). He also dished out the second most hero damage for Alliance with 9,500. Alliance would drop Game Three and the match to Team Liquid. s4 has been a solid player during The Shanghai Major with an overall tournament KDA of 52/33/94.

EGM: Disappointing start at The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Jerry ""EGM"" Lundkvist

Team: Alliance

Update: EGM toiled to a lackluster KDA of 7/21/21 in Alliance's 1-2 loss to Team Liquid at The Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: EGM had an ugly start to the match playing Silencer. His nine deaths (1/9/5) were the most of any player in the game and he was out of action just under nine minutes. Dazzel would be the hero of choice for EGM in Game Two, but the results were the same. A KDA of 3/4/11 would put him last in kills and assists for his team during the game. Not surprisingly EGM would also rank last in total gold (16,311), last hits (106) and denies (2). During team fights, EGM just couldn't hit the Arcane Curse/Global Silence combo and was rendered ineffective.

Playing Spirit Breaker in Game Three, EGM was in the jungle for most of the game. However, when EGM roamed to the top lane, he got beat up by Team Liquid's Invoker (FATA) dying three times. In The Shanghai Major, EGM has a KDA of 21/40/79.

FATA: Invokes Team Liquid to 2-1 win over Alliance at The Shanghai Major Finals

Name: Adrian ""FATA"" Trinks

Team: Team Liquid

Update: FATA played well posting a 20/9/33 KDA in their 2-1 opening round win over Alliance in The Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: FATA was a force while holding down the mid lane with Outworld Devourer in Game One. He stuffed the mid-lane so brutally that there was only one push and it was knocked back aggressively at the 32:46 mark. He finished Game One with a KDA of 7/2/9 participating in just over half of Team Liquid's kills. Choosing Invoker for Game Two, FATA just couldn't seem to get a rhythm as Alliance skirted the mid-lane and attacked from top and bottom. FATA couldn't keep up with the rotation, but did manage to be second in assists on the team with 10, going along with his two kills.

Surprisingly, Invoker was not being banned by Alliance and FATA chose him again and this time it paid off. Using a Quas-Exort build, Invoker teamed up with the Anti-Mage using their powers in unison to absolutely crush Alliance. Invoker finished Game Three with a KDA of 11/2/14 and a double kill at the end of the match securing a Team Liquid win and advancement to the second round of the winner's bracket.

MATUMBAMAN: Monstrous match earns Team Liquid first round win

Name: Lasse ""MATUMBAMAN"" Urpalainen

Team: Team Liquid

Update: MATUMBAMAN, proving again why he is one of the best players in the world, rocketed to a 26/9/31 KDA in Team Liquid's first round win at The Shanghai Major on Tuesday.

Analysis: MATUMBAMAN created chaos and uncertainty for Alliance in Game One using Ursa, going with a powerful melee build. MATUMBAMAN leveled Fury Swipes to three and Overpower to two as his first five ability upgrades. In a great story line, MATUMBAMAN seemed to make it a personal mission to annihilate Silence (EGM) killing him on six different occasions and assisting once. In fact, killing Silencer at the 37:41 was key in capturing Game One. Game Two would see MATUMBAMAN struggle out of the gate with Necrophos decaying to a 4/8/14 KDA and a Team Liquid loss.

However, in Game Three, MATUMBAMAN would choose the Anti-Mage casting to a 8/0/12 KDA. Farming early and often, MATUMBAMAN gained 34,130 gold and had an astonishing 540 last hits which rocketed his XPM to 725. Alliance made the mistake of allowing MATUMBAMAN to farm unrestricted and this helped Team Liquid win Game Three.

KuroKy: Early jitters settle as KuroKy helps Team Liquid to win

Name: Kuro ""KuroKy"" Salehi Takhasomi

Team: Team Liquid

Update: KuroKy started off slow but salvaged an even KDA going 13/13/28 in Team Liquid's 2-1 win over Alliance in the opening round of the Shanghai Major Finals on Tuesday.

Analysis: KuroKy couldn't find the handle playing Tusk in Game One, limping to a 1/4/12 KDA while roaming the jungle in a Team Liquid win. Game Two would prove futile with KuroKy as Shadow Shaman going 6/6/7 with his team losing Game Two. Then came the Night Stalker. KuroKy played his best game of the series, using Void to perfection, maxing out the power by level seven. At the 25:17 mark of Game Three, KuroKy was instrumental in stopping a last ditch effort push in the mid-lane by Alliance, gaining two kills and an assist. This all but sealed the game and match for Team Liquid. KuroKy hasn't put up great numbers in The Shanghai Major and will need to improve if Team Liquid is going to win.

FEB. 29, 2016

KuroKy: Can't find consistency against Virtus.pro

Name: Kuro ""KuroKy"" Salehi Takhasomi

Team: Team Liquid

Update: KuroKy had a 4//13/35 KDA as Team Liquid fell 2-1 to Virtus.pro in the opening round of group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: KuroKy took a safe lane Tusk in Game One against Virtus.pro and had an efficient game, posting a 1/1/11 KDA. KuroKy did his job of enabling his carries, FATA and MATUMBAMAN, while dishing out a neat 4,100 damage. In Game Two, KuroKy picked up Tusk again but did not have similar results. KuroKy posted a 2/8/16 KDA in Team Liquid's loss to Virtus.pro. KuroKy dealt a decent amount of damage, blasting opponents for 5,700 but his deaths skyrocketed in the second tilt. In the make-or-break Game Three, KuroKy went with Enchantress and could not find success. KuroKy roamed around and posted a 1/4/8 KDA as Team Liquid fell 2-1 to Virtus.pro.

FATA: Solid play not enough for Team Liquid

Name: Adrian ""FATA"" Trinks

Team: Team Liquid

Update: FATA posted a 15/6/13 KDA during Team Liquid's 2-1 loss to Virtus.pro in the opening round of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: FATA showed why Invoker is a good pick in the mid lane at the Shanghai Major, recording a 5/1/9 KDA as Team Liquid defeated Virtus.pro in Game One of Group D games. FATA dealt the second most damage on his team, bashing opponents for 8,900 damage. FATA had his Invoker banned away in Game Two, but still had a powerful showing even though Team Liquid lost. FATA took Puck into the mid lane and produced. The mid laner went 7/2/10 while doing a game high 11,000 damage. FATA couldn't carry Team Liquid in Game Three either, as Virtus.pro took the series 2-1. FATA selected Phantom Lancer for the mid lane and earned a 3/3/4 KDA, doling out the second most damage on his team with 7,800.

JerAx: Slumps in final game against Virtus.pro

Name: Jesse ""JerAx"" Vainikka

Team: Team Liquid

Update: JerAx had a 8/16/30 KDA during Team Liquid's 2-1 loss to Virtus.pro in the opening round of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: JerAx played a safe lane Phoenix in Game One of Team Liquid's series against Virtus.pro in Group D. JerAx had a 1/2/13 KDA on the ranged champion, helping set up his teammates for flashy plays and fight control. JerAx, despite playing a low economy Phoenix, dished out 5,400 damage. JerAx got his Phoenix again in Game Two, but couldn't sustain Game One's success as Virtus.pro evened up the series. JerAx recorded a 6/6/13 KDA and pummeled opponents for 8,400 damage, but he tripled his deaths from the first game (six). JerAx borrowed Tusk away from his teammate KuroKy, who played the hero in Games One and Two. His showing wasn't strong, as he posted a 1/8/4 KDA during Team Liquid's series sealing loss to Virtus.pro.

MinD_ContRoL: Spotty play against Virtus.pro not enough

Name: Ivan ""MinD_ContRoL"" Borislavov

Team: Team Liquid

Update: MinD_ContRoL finished with a 10/10/23 in Team Liquid's 2-1 loss to Virtus.pro in the opening series of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: MinD_ContRoL roamed between the mid lane and the jungle on the Faceless Void as Team Liquid defeated Virtus.pro in Game One of Group D. MinD_ContRoL's KDA was 1/0/6, complimenting his team's Gyrocopter and Invoker to help Liquid to a 24-minute victory. Virtus.pro banned out MinD_ContRoL's Faceless Void in Game Two, pushing the jungler onto Nature's Prophet. MinD_ContRoL went 4/6/13, significantly upping his damage in the process, wailing on opponents for 7,000 damage. But after playing a squeaky clean Game One, MinD_ContRoL's deaths spiked in Game Two. MinD_ContRoL played a third unique hero in Game Three, taking Beastmaster into a top safe lane. He had a bounceback performance, but it wasn't enough as Liquid fell to Virtus.pro in Game Three. MinD_ContRoL went 5/4/4, dealing 3,600 damage to towers in the process.

MATUMBAMAN: Solid play doesn't translate into win against Virtus.pro

Name: Lasse ""MATUMBAMAN"" Urpalainen

Team: Team Liquid

Update: MATUMBAMAN had a 21/10/19 KDA as Team Liquid fell 2-1 to Virtus.pro in the opening round of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: MATUMBAMAN did the heavy carrying for Team Liquid in its Game One win over Virtus.pro in Group D. MATUMBAMAN nabbed Gyrocopter and went to work, racking up an impressive 11/2/4 KDA. MATUMBAMAN exploded for a game high 12,400 damage while collecting a monstrous amount of gold (16,800). Unfortunately, MATUMBAMAN did not have a repeat performance in Game Two, a loss. MATUMBAMAN played a safe lane Luna and while he did have a decent KDA, 5/4/9, he couldn't carry. He dealt 5,700 damage and hammered towers for 1,700 damage, but did not fully optimize his mountain of gold (18,700). MATUMBAMAN went with a safe lane Ursa in Game Three, but it didn't spell success for Liquid. MATUMBAMAN finished with a 5/4/6 KDA and led his team in damage (8,700), but he couldn't power Liquid to a series win over Virtus.pro.

fng: Steady and alert in Virtus.pro's win over Team Liquid

Name: Artsiom ""fng"" Barshack

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update: fng had a 5/13/24 KDA as Virtus.pro defeated Team Liquid 2-1 in the opening round of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: fng went with Chen in Virtus.pro's Game One loss to Team Liquid in Group D. The jungler went 1/5/1, perhaps only standing out for his 1,100 worth of healing. fng went with Winter Wyvern in Game Two and had a better KDA, going 2/4/10 as Virtus.pro evened the series at 1-1. fng's damage jumped to 7,300 thanks to the offlane pick. In Game Three, fng spent the game in the middle with Crystal Maiden, posting a 2/4/13 KDA and helping Virtus.pro claim its series against Team Liquid. fng made sure his mid laner had a big game.

Silent: Ramps up in 2-1 win over Team Liquid

Name: Airat ""Silent"" Gaziev

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update: Silent ended with a 19/7/16 KDA as Virtus.pro defeated Team Liquid 2-1 in the opening round of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Silent played a safe lane Spectre against Team Liquid during Game One of Virtus.pro's series in Group D. Silent had the best game of his comrades, which isn't saying much/ Silent had a 0/1/5 KDA and pumped out 4,200 damage while accumulating 11,100 gold, but Virtus.pro couldn't keep pace with Team Liquid. Silent opted for a safe lane Chaos Knight Game Two and it paid dividends. Silent finished with a 8/5/10 KDA, while pocketing 23,100 gold and crushing Team Liquid with 10,100 damage. Silent changed it up in Game Three, using a safe lane Sven to help Virtus.pro claim its series over Team Liquid. Silent went 11/1/6, dealing the most damage in the game with 11,900 and most tower damage with 5,000. Silent also earned an absurd 26,000 gold.

God: Ends series in style to defeat Team Liquid

Name: Sergey ""God"" Bragin

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update: God finished with a 15/11/16 KDA and Virtus.pro defeated Team Liquid 2-1 in the opening series of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: God had a tough time in the mid lane with his Death Prophet in Game One of Virtus.pro's series against Team Liquid to open up Group D. God displayed a 3/6/1 KDA, leading his team in damage with 6,400, but could not survive team fights and engagements, dying a game high six times. God switched to Templar Assassin in Game Two, carrying Virtus.pro to a win. God went 6/2/5 in the mid lane, dishing out 10,300 damage while rolling in 28,400 gold. In Game Three, God went back to his Game One pick: Death Prophet. This time, however, God excelled, finishing with a 6/3/10 KDA and blasting Liquid for 11,600 damage.

DkPhobos: Does a little bit of everything for Virtus.pro

Name: Alexander ""DkPhobos"" Kucheria

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update:DkPhobos had a 7/14/24 KDA and Virtus.pro defeated Team Liquid 2-1 in the opening round of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: DkPhobos posted a 1/4/4 KDA on Spirit Breaker during Virtus.pro's Game One loss to Team Liquid in the opening games of Group D. DkPhobos took Spirit Breaker into an offlane, but didn't have much success. He dealt 3,700 damage and healed allies for 707. DkPhobos' offlane prospects improved in Game Two when he posted a KDA of 4/6/8 as he played Dark Seer to a better success. DkPhobos healed teammates (1,600) while carving out some damage (5,100). In Game Three, Dkphobos went back to Dark Seer and played another solid game, finishing with a 2/4/12. His heals (1,300) helped his team survive and take down Liquid in the series clinching Game Three.

Lil: Strong play helps propel Virtus.pro

Name: Ilya ""Lil"" Ilyuk

Team: Virtus.Pro

Update: Lil recorded a 9/13/25 KDA as Virtus.pro defeated Team Liquid in the opening round of Group D at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Lil had a 1/3/3 KDA on Vengeful Spirit in Game One against Team Liquid in the opening series of Group D. Lil played a top lane support on Vengeful Spirit but couldn't find the right combinations to get Virtus.pro rolling. Lil broke out Io in Game Two and had a 6/7/13 KDA as Virtus.pro evened the series. Lil went hard with the heals (3,300), supporting his team out of a safe lane. Lil went with Oracle in Game Three and played the hero solidly, posting a 2/3/9 KDA. LIl healed his teammates for 2,300 and showed he could shave off a few deaths from Game Two as Virtus.pro won the series.

FEB. 28, 2016

Ramzes: Team Spirit hands Vici Gaming two game sweep

Name: Roman ""Ramzes"" Kushnarev

Team: Team Spirit

Update: Ramzes led his team to a pair of convincing victories, posting a KDA of 11/3/17 in the Shanghai Major lower bracket match.

Analysis: In Game One, Ramzes, playing the Chaos Knight offlane, dominated the entire game. Ramzes crushed with ten kills while also assisting in another eight. Ramzes only died once during the game, ensuring that he would be on the map plenty to secure farm. In Game Two, Ramzes took on a less aggressive role, this time playing the offlane Beastmaster. Ramzes was relied upon to give his team vision and lockdown in team fights. Ramzes participated in 10 of 23 kills, while also providing a nice pushing boost: racking up the second most tower damage in the game.

AfterLife: Team Spirit defeats Vici Gaming in a two game sweep

Name: Vasily ""AfterLife"" Shishkin

Team: Team Spirit

Update: AfterLife gave Team Spirit a boost playing two solid games, ending the series with a KDA of 16/2/19 in a Shanghai Major lower bracket match.

Analysis: In Game One, AfterLife, playing the safelane and farming Nature's Prophet, acted as the primary damage dealer for Team Spirit. AfterLife led all players in kills (11) while also dealing the most damage of any hero in the game: racking up over 16,000 points. In Game Two, AfterLife repeated his role as Nature's Prophet, this time taking his talents to the offlane. AfterLife played a very clean Game Two, only dying once and acting as a global initiator and lane pusher. He tallied five kills and had six assists.

Loda: Alliance rolls over FNATIC in 2-0 sweep in round two of Shanghai Major

Name: Jonathan ""Loda"" Berg

Team: Alliance

Update: Loda set the pace with a dominant performance in Game One, ending the series with a KDA of 19/8/29.

Analysis: Loda, playing the safe lane Spectre, was the alpha dog in Game One. Loda racked up 15 kills to lead all players, as well as topping the farming charts, leading all players in XPM (534) and GPM(695) . The Spectre pick played right into an underlying global strategy of Alliance, as they also had S4 Zeus to follow up any initiations. In Game Two, Loda, playing the safe lane Drow Ranger, had noticeably less of an impact than in Game One, but still played a solid game. Loda tallied 13 assists, but just couldn't seem to find the last hit on many heroes, as he only had three kills.

AdmiralBulldog: Alliance rolls over FNATIC in 2-0 sweep in round two of Shanghai Major

Name: Henrik ""AdmiralBulldog"" Ahnberg

Team: Alliance

Update: AdmiralBulldog combined with Loda to lead Alliance to a sweep of FNATIC, posting a KDA of 20/6/21.

Analysis: In Game One, Bulldog, playing the offlane Beastmaster, was relegated to more of a utility role, focusing on executing in team fights and providing game and map awareness with vision from his hawk. In Game One he tallied a respectable KDA of 4/4/11, but his true wrath would be felt in Game Two. In Game Two, Bulldog, playing the offlane Weaver, found himself in a much more active role than his previous game. Bulldog tallied 16 kills to lead all players, as well as providing a nice pushing presence, as Bulldog racked up nearly 7000 points of tower damage. Bulldog also managed to assist on an additional ten kills, giving him a hand in 26 of 29 of Alliance's kills.

Limmp: Goes big early but can't get back on track

Name: Linus ""Limmp"" Blomdin

Team: compLexity Gaming

Update: Limmp was superb in Game One, but couldn't sustain his push, totaling a 18/13/15 KDA in a 1-2 loss in the opening round of Group D play at The Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Limmp, playing Tiny, occupied mid lane in Game One and cascaded to a 16/3/12 KDA. He dominated EG's Suma1L in mid lane going five kills and 2 assists against his counterpart. His dominance in mid lane was crucial to the Game One win. Limmp would use Tiny again in Game Two hoping to reproduce the same results as Game One. This wasn't the case as he didn't register a single kill going 0/3/1 KDA in a game he would probrobably like to forget. In the third and deciding game, Limmp chose Morphling, but was countered by Suma1L's Lina in the mid. Limmp was again pushed back mid lane managing a 2/7/2 KDA.

Chessie: Plays conservatively in compLexity's 1-2 loss to Evil Geniuses

Name: Rasmus ""Chessie"" Blomdin

Team: compLexity Gaming

Update: Chessie toiled to a 10/11/15 KDA in compLexity Gaming's loss in Group D bracket play in The Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Chessie, roaming bottom lane with Phantom Lancer, was second on the team in kills with eight in Game One of Saturday's contest. Chessie also pulled off three multi-kills and went on a killing spree of five picking up 20,300 gold using that to purchase items to increase his speed. Games Two and Three were identical in KDA with a 1/4/1 and unfortunately so were the game losses. There appears to be a pattern developing with Chessie in terms of having a great Game One and then stuttering down the stretch.

Handsken: Very little killing and farming make for hard day in loss to EG

Name: Simon ""Handsken"" Haag

Team: compLexity Gaming

Update: Handsken didn't get much going, limping to a 6/18/15 KDA in compLexity's 1-2 loss to Evil Geniuses in Group D play of The Shanghai Major.

Analysis: In an interesting pick, Handsken chose Io in Game One and used the wisp very well tethering himself to Tiny (Limmp) in the middle lane. Spirits was maxed out by level seven and was used brilliantly to harass enemy heroes gaining a KDA of 4/6/11. But as most of compLexity gaming's heroes, Handsken was denied any kills in Game Two and could only manage two in Game Three. Handsken will look to rebound when compLexity takes on Spirit in the first round of The Shanghai Major Finals next week.

FEB. 26, 2016

ShiKi: Plays well in Group A match at The Shanghai Major

Name: Huang ""ShiKi"" Jiwei

Team: CDEC Gaming

Update: Shiki posted a respectable KDA of 15/8/14 as the lone bright spot in a losing effort for CDEC.

Analysis: In Game One, Shiki played the middle lane with Puck and dominated the entire match. His presence was felt throughout Game One as he bullied the opposing OD in lane and then carried the momentum throughout the rest of the match. Shiki tallied a KDA of 8/1/10 en route to a Game One CDEC victory. The victory would be short lived however, as Shiki threw up a stinker of a Game Two, playing the safe lane with Razor.

Shiki ended the game without a single kill and only one assist while dying four times in the 24 minute match. In Game Three, Shiki rebounded and put on a strong showing for his team, but couldn't manage to come away with the victory. Shiki played Lina middle lane and was the only player keeping CDEC afloat. Shiki tallied seven kills, good enough for second most. Shiki also also tallied the second most Hero Damage, with 10,300.

oldchicken: Stellar match lands big numbers at The Shanghai Major

Name: Wang ""oldchicken"" Zhiyong

Team: Ehome

Update: oldchicken proved his worth pecking his way to a solid KDA of 28/15/29.

Analysis: In Game One, oldchicken, playing the mid lane OD, was the raid boss for EHOME, tallying 17 kills in a bloodbath of a game that featured 76 total kills. oldchicken was also one of the top farmers by the end of the match, coming in second in both XPM (584) and GPM (508). Game Two saw oldchicken heading into the offlane as Death Prophet, which predictably didn't end well. oldchicken tallied just three kills in a disappointing Game Two performance as EHOME dropped the game to CDEC.

In Game Three, oldchicken returned to form dominating the game, utilizing the Warlock mid lane. oldchicken was second in the game in total kills with eight, while scoring another ten assists. oldchicken was able to shine in EHOME's team fight centric lineup.

Jeyo: Lone bright spot in Archon's 0-2 loss to OG at The Shanghai Major

Name: Jio ""Jeyo"" Madayag

Team: Team Archon

Update: Jeyo managed a team best 11/9/11 KDA against OG in a 0-2 loss at The Shanghai Major on Friday.

Analysis: Jeyo led Archon in kills with four tabulating a 4/3/3 KDA in Game One playing top lane. However, because of the buckling defense in mid lane, Jeyo was mostly on the defensive and couldn't get much going. Game Two was a little better for Jeyo, due to some reckless play from OG in the mid lane allowing Jeyo to earn a respectable 7/6/8 KDA with Outworld Devourer. He ended the game with a multi-kill and posted a killing spree of three.

monkeys-forever: Poor selection dooms Archon in The Shanghai Major

Name: Jaron ""monkeys-forever"" Clinton

Team: Team Archon

Update: monkeys-forever could not have gotten off to a worse start with a 4/13/11 KDA in Archon's 0-2 loss to OG in Group C play at The Shanghai Major on Friday.

Analysis: In Game One, monkeys-forever was shutout from any kills as Jakiro while playing in the mid lane. Jakiro, normally used in support, had a terrible match-up against OG's Lone Druid (Miracle) and simply couldn't compete. He ended Game One with a KDA of 0/6/3, leading Archon in deaths. Game Two wasn't much better as monkeys-forever again led Archon in deaths with seven (4/7/8), but did manage to get in on a few garbage time assists, totaling eight. monkeys-forever put himself at a disadvantage from the start, selecting Ember Spirit who simply cannot melee at high levels. Head-scratching selections seemingly doomed monkeys-forever from the very beginning.

BigDaddy: Solid match lifts OG to win over Archon

Name: Johan ""BigDaddy"" Sundstein

Team: OG

Update: BigDaddy was an all-around performer for OG posting a 12/8/23 KDA in OG's 2-0 win over Archon in The Shanghai Major on Friday.

Analysis: BigDaddy, playing Batrider to a 4/2/10 KDA in Game One, used his speed to harass and hinder enemies in the mid and bottom lanes. BigDaddy seemed to be particularly interested in Archon's Nature's Prophet who he killed once and assisted in three other kills in an attempt to get him to use his teleportation on defense.

In Game Two, BigDaddy switched to offense, going mid lane, selecting Zeus. With Zeus, BigDaddy dished out massive amounts of damage (23,100) and led all players in kills with eight. This was a very solid match for BigDaddy as OG continues its upward climb at The Shanghai Major.

MoonMeander: A little reckless in OG's sweep win over Archon

Name: David ""MoonMeander"" Tan

Team: OG

Update: MoonMeander had a two-game combined KDA of 5/10/22 in OG's 2-0 first round win over Archon in a Group C match on Friday.

Analysis: MoonMeander was reckless in both games of this contest as he was caught on multiple occasions in Archon ganks. Using Weaver in Game One, he was decidedly average posting in the middle of the pack in just about very statistical category with a 3/2/8 KDA . In Game Two, playing Batrider, he was caught out early and often, becoming first death very early at 1:08.

Although MoonMeander was second in assists with 14, he led his own team deaths with eight - ultimately forcing him out of action for for 4 minutes and 38 seconds. This was part of the reason the second game lasted much longer that the first. MoonMeander is still going to get numbers in terms of assists, but will need to throttle back on the headstrong rush.

Fly-Simba-: Plays support role in OG's sweep over Archon

Name: Tai ""Fly-Simba-"" Aizik

Team: OG

Update: Fly-Simba played well in support from the top safe lane with a 9/5/18 KDA in OG's match against Archon on Friday.

Analysis: The constant in Fly-Simba's style for both games of this match was his ability to place Observer and Sentry Wards throughout the map in order to get good vision on his enemies. He worked this in Game One, placing seven Observer and four Sentry Wards and placed 10 Sentry and nine Observer Wards in Game Two.

In Game Two, while still placing wards, Fly-Simba transitioned to more of a damaging support role (74 percent kill participation) primarily because of Archon's banning of Lone Druid, who had been ridiculously effective in Game One. Fly-Simba rallied to a KDA of 6/1/11, playing and ganking from the top lane. This was a strong match for Fly-Simba, but remember, the kills and assist might not always be there depending on what type of support role is needed.

Miracle: Complete domination in Round One of Group C

Name: Amer ""Miracle"" Barqawi

Team: OG

Update: Miracle went off, dominating the field in just about every category boasting a 13/2/10 KDA in OG's victory over Archon on Friday.

Analysis: Miracle led all players in gold (44,600), denies (38), last hits (580), and tower damage (13,700). He was absolutely dominate in Game One with a KDA of 7/0/5, playing Lone Druid. Miracle landed a great triple kill at the 18 minute mark and teamed up with his bear, to earn a killing spree of seven. Game Two was more of the same. Miracle was banned out of Lone Druid, but came back selecting Phantom Lancer and his ranged attack to pester enemy players and towers. Miracle, in an almost RPG-like frame of mind, used his farming abilities to gain significant level and item advantages throughout this 2-0 match win over Archon.

Cr1t: Dominates all players in assists in Group C play

Name: Andreas ""Cr1t"" Nielsen

Team: OG

Update: Cr1t played a very aggressive style scoring a 6/9/28 KDA in OG's Round One win over Archon in Group C action at The Shanghai Major on Friday.

Analysis: In Game One Cr1t chose Earthshaker using multiple area of effect attacks in order to stun and damage multiple Archon opponents. Cr1t drew a quick first blood at nearly three minutes into the game and had a killing spree of three right at the eight minute mark. Cr1t took part in 82 percent of the total kills in Game One.

In Game Two, playing Elder Titan, Cr1t was a little too aggressive getting caught early for some deaths, but rebounded to lead all players with 15 assists. Cr1t played the support role from close and afar sending out Astral Spirit and buying items such as Dust of Appearance to slow opponents so his teammates could level them. Cr1t will look to continue his assist gathering ways during this tournament.

eLeVeN: Negative KDA dooms EHOME in Group A bottom bracket loss to Team Secret

Name: Yang ""eLeVeN"" Wei Ren

Team: Ehome

Update: eLeVen had an off night with his 4/10/9 KDA in a two game loss to Team Secret in The Shanghai Major tournament on Thursday.

Analysis: eLeVen simply couldn't put it together in Game One playing Night Stalker at top easy, going 0/6/3. Team Secret's EternaLEnVy chased eLeVen on both sides of the map getting three kills against eLeVen. While Game Two was an improvement, it still wasn't enough to get a win with eLeVen limping to a 4/4/6 KDA. He was a full item behind the rest of his team and simply couldn't catch up after falling behind. EHOME and ELeVeN are 5-5 in their last 10 matches.

w33: Solid play lifts Team Secret over EHOME

Name: Aliwi ""w33"" Omar

Team: Team Secret

Update: w33 was instrumental in Team Secret's win over EHOME with a 11/6/10 KDA in the bottom bracket final at The Shanghai Major on Thursday.

Analysis: After being banned from Broodmother in Game One, w33 came up big with Windranger getting up to level 17 with a KDA of 6/2/7. w33 also ranked first on the team with 11 denies and 19,300 gold. As the Windranger, w33 bottled up mid lane and then sealed the win in Game One with a double-kill at 34:15 on the Ancient rush. In Game Two, w33 was a little underwhelming as Invoker, which surprisingly wasn't banned, but grinded out some kills going 5/4/3 again holding down mid lane. This was another good performance in this tournament.

EternaLEnVy: Plays tough but not enough to overcome MVP Phoenix in Group A Finals

Name: Jacky ""EternaLEnVy"" Mao

Team: Team Secret

Update: EternaLEnVy put together a mild 7/9/8 KDA in their Group A Finals loss to MVP Phoenix at The Shanghai Major on Thursday.

Analysis: Not a whole lot to speak of here as Team Secret was absolutely dismantled. EternaLEnVy was banned from both Zues and Lion in Game One and settled in with Gyrocopter, going 2/4/1 in the bottom lane. Game Two was much of the same with EternaLEnVy going with Tiny holding down mid. Perhaps a little frustration came into play accounting for the five deaths he suffered at the hands of MVP Phoenix leading to a death time of 2:34. EternaLEnvy finished with a 5/5/7 in Game Two.

MP: Plays top and bottom lanes in victory over Secret in Group A final

Name: Pyo ""MP"" No-a

Team: MVP Phoenix

Update: MP played a solid match taking turns on the top and bottom lanes with a 10/3/18 KDA in their Group A finals win over Secret at The Shanghai Major on Thursday.

Analysis: In Game One, MP was banned out of Broodmother and chose Juggernaut to roam at top safe. MP maxed out Blade Fury by level seven and pushed the top lane hard into Radiant territory. By 16 minutes, MP had his Omnislash working mid lane slaying Radiant players, gaining a MVP Phoenix win in a mere 18 minutes. Secret banned Broodmother from MP in Game 2, so pivoted to Leshrac and racked up better numbers with a 6/3/10 KDA. Farming effectively, MP led in gold with 13.600 and tied in kill participation at 80 percent. MP's aggressive play should continue to rack up kills and assists as this tournament continues.

QO: Unstoppable in group stage win over EHOME

Name: Kim ""QO"" Seon-yeop

Team: MVP Phoenix

Update: QO went an astonishing 23/2/16 in MVP Phoenix's drubbing of EHOME in a 2-0 first round win during the group stages of The Shanghai Major on Thursday.

Analysis: QO was simply superior in both games of the match. Using Ember Spirit, he scored his first kill at the six second mark of Game One and was so effective that there were zero EHOME kills that took place on MVP Phoenix's side of the map. QO farmed heavily in Game One utilizing 148 last hits while leading all players with 14,453 gold, allowing item buys early and often. Game Two was even better for QO. In the top safe lane playing Slark, QO went 13/1/10 with a three player multi-kill and a seven player killing spree in an absolute rout of EHOME. QO would end up being the top leveler in both games.

BurNIng: Hot and cold play dooms Vici Gaming to Round One loss

Name: Xu ""BurNIng"" Zhilei

Team: VICI Gaming

Update: Burning put together a 14/9/13 KDA during Vici Gaming's 2-1 series loss in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: BurNing got rich with his safe lane Sven, but gave away a few kills in the process, going 5/5/6 against Fnatic in Game One of the Group A series. BurNing led the game in gold earned with 31,900. BurNing came back to play a safe lane Morphling in Game Two, bagging piles of gold as Vici Gaming took down Fnatic. BurNing horded 23,600 gold and dealt the second most damage on his team with 10,000 with the ranged carry, finishing with a perfect 9/0/7 KDA. BurNing was decidedly outplayed in Game Three, dying four times while Fnatic defeated Vici Gaming and claimed the series. BurNing played a mid lane Bristleback in Game Three, going 0/4/0 and dealing a paltry 2,300 damage. He once again earned the most gold on his team (9,500) but it wasn't enough to spark Vici Gaming.

Super!: Shines on Invoker, flounders on Razor in loss to Fnatic

Name: Xie ""Super!"" Junhao

Team: VICI Gaming

Update: Super! had a 13/5/23 KDA during Vici Gaming's 2-1 series loss in the group stage at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Super! played like his namesake with a walloping 16,500 damage as Invoker in Game One against Fnatic, which Vici Gaming lost. In that game, the mid laner was the lone bright spot, going 6/2/11 while netting the second most gold on his team at 25,000. He also led his team in tower damage with 3,200, the second most in the game. Super! got better in Game Two with Invoker, recording a flawless game with a 6/0/12 KDA. Super! once again demonstrated his power, dealing 14,000 damage, the most in the game. The VG player had his Invoker drafted away from him in Game Three, opting to play safe lane Razor. Unfortunately, it did not go over well. Super! went 1/3/0 and only managed to deal 3,500 damage. Without Invoker, Super! lost his strength.

IceIceIce: Inconsistent during Vici Gaming's 2-1 series loss to Fnatic

Name: Koh ""IceIceIce"" Pei Xiang

Team: VICI Gaming

Update: IceIceIce posted a 10/11/25 KDA during Vici Gaming's 2-1 series loss in the group stage at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Vici Gaming's IceIceIce opened Game One against Fnatic with Batrider and made some great initiations, which he couldn't maintain. He finished with a 3/5/11 KDA and dished out the third most damage on his team at 8,400. IceIceIce reversed his puny impact from Game One with a 5/3/14 KDA in Game Two. He dealt 9,900 damage on Elder Titan (again good for third most on this team), steadying his performance overall. IceIceIce managed to deal the most damage on his team in Game Three, except it was only 6,500 and Vici Gaming lost. IceIceIce played a safe lane Broodmother and had the best game on his team, going 2/3/0 during Vici Gaming's 22-minute loss. He dealt the most damage to towers on his team with 1,400, but couldn't do enough to keep Vici Gaming from falling 2-1 in the series.

Fenrir: Falls off in the mid lane against Fnatic

Name: Lu ""Fenrir"" Chao

Team: VICI Gaming

Update: Fenrir had a 4/16/20 KDA during Vici Gaming's 2-1 series loss in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Fenrir used a safe lane Tusk in Vici Gaming's Game One loss to Fnatic. Fenrir didn't hit the mark with Tusk, dying nine times en route to a 1/9/10 game. Fenrir swapped out Tusk for a safe lane Earth Spirit in Game Two against Fnatic, and it worked. Fenrir finished with a 3/5/10 KDA, aptly playing his role and emphasizing his teammates' strengths. Fenrir went with Witch Doctor in Game Three and didn't accomplish much. The VG player went 0/2/0 from the mid lane, recording the lowest amount of gold on his team (3,900). Fenrir never fully tapped into Witch Doctor's damage dealing potential, hitting enemies for only 399 damage, while not opting to tech into any heals.

fy: Can't find rhythm against Fnatic

Name: Xu ""fy"" Linsen

Team: VICI Gaming

Update: Fy had a 4/12/26 KDA during Vici Gaming's 2-1 series loss in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: fy started with a safe lane Phoenix in Game One of this Group A opening match. fy went 3/5/12, standing out with some of his ranged abilities and initiations. With his Phoenix pick he was able to provide 1,400 points of healing to his team. Fy busted out a Winter Wyvern in Game Two and went 1/3/13 in Vici Gaming's bounce back win. fy turned around his performance from Game One, dying less and aiding his team with critical engages.

fy geared up with another unique champion in Game Three, as he used Night Stalker in the jungle. While the hero selection was certainly interesting, fy didn't post positive results, finishing with a 0/4/1 KDA in the series-ending loss.

Ohaiyo: Lone Druid banned, goes perfect on Tidehunter against Vici Gaming

Name: Chong Xin ""Ohaiyo"" Khoo

Team: Fnatic

Update: Ohaiyo had a 10/9/21 KDA during Fnatic's 2-1 series win over Vici Gaming in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Ohaiyo began the series against Vici Gaming with Lone Druid, and went off in the first game. The offlane carry dealt a huge amount of tower damage, hammering down structures for 4,500 damage. Ohaiyo grabbed the most gold on his team with 27,600, earning a neat KDA of 2/3/13 in Fnatic's opening win over Vici Gaming. Ohaiyo got his Lone Druid in an offlane again in Game Two, but floundered as Fnatic fell to Vici Gaming. Ohaiyo went 5/6/2, while earning the most gold on his team at 16,600.

His tower damage fell off significantly (1,000) in Game Two, as Fnatic was unable to generate much pushing power. Ohaiyo couldn't pick up Lone Druid for Game Three after Vici Gaming banned it, but it turns out, Ohaiyo's Tidehunter is pretty good, too. Ohaiyo went 3/0/6 with his different offlane pick as Fnatic went on to score the series victory.

net: Forces Shadow Shaman ban, still delivers in Game Three

Name: Wai ""net"" Pern Lim

Team: Fnatic

Update: Net had an 8/8/26 KDA during Fnatic's 2-1 series win over Vici Gaming in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Net opened Game One with an offlane Shadow Shaman and posted a staggering 7/2/10 KDA in Fnatic's win over Vici Gaming. Net made the most of his limited resources, only reaching level 16, but still racked up seven kills. Net moved into the jungle for Game Two with his Shadow Shaman, but the end result left much to be desired. Net went 0/4/9, unable to maximize his limited resources. Net had his Shadow Shaman banned away from him in Game Three, taking a safe lane Disruptor in its stead. Net went 1/2/7, posting what was essentially a middle of the road game for him.

Miduan: Up and down day enough for Fnatic

Name: Nai Zheng ""Miduan"" Yeik

Team: Fnatic

Update: Miduan had a 10/11/26 KDA during Fnatic's 2-1 series win over Vici Gaming in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: In Game One, Miduan made good use of Nyx Assassins' early game, initiating fights correctly and escaping sticky situations. Miduan finished 4/5/14 in the first game of the series, but dealt the second highest amount damage of his team at 10,100. The stealth from the Assassin in particular allowed Fnatic to have slightly more vision and the team benefited from it, winning the first game. Miduan took a step backward in Game Two on a mid lane Puck.

Miduan died six times, and was unable to provide much of a punch offensively, earning only one kill and assisting in just eight. Miduan finished with over 6,000 less gold than his counterpart, Super. He did manage to deal the lion's share of his team's damage with 9,900. Fnatic took away Fenrir's Invoker in Game Three, and Miduan proved he had the chops for the hero, too. Miduan went 5/0/4, leading Fnatic over Vici Gaming. Miduan did the most damage in the game with 9,700 and he also managed to record the second most gold with 14,300.

DJ: Good Chen play helps Fnatic to clinch series

Name: Djardel ""DJ"" Mampusti

Team: Fnatic

Update: DJ had a 6/11/20 KDA during Fnatic's 2-1 series win over Vici Gaming in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: DJ took Chen into the jungle in Game One and dished out heals. Although the jungler didn't put up an eye-popping KDA, he went 2/3/8, and was a consistent factor in revitalizing his team, healing allies for 5,300. Chen proved to be a theme for DJ in Game Two, although his impact seemingly diminished. DJ went 0/7/6 in Game Two, again healing for a decent amount (2,000), but not nearly as much as Game One. Game Three found DJ using Chen for a third consecutive time, helping Fnatic seal its series win over Vici Gaming. DJ only died once and also dealt a decent amount of damage (4,800), posting a 4/1/6 KDA.

Mushi: Three unique champions help deliver Fnatic series win in Group B

Name: Chai ""Mushi"" Yee Fung

Team: Fnatic

Update: Mushi had an 18/8/13 KDA during Fnatic's 2-1 series win over Vici Gaming in the group stages at the Shanghai Major.

Analysis: Mushi pulled out a safe lane Silencer in Game One of Group B and dominated. Mushi rolled to a game high 11 kills, finishing with a 11/5/8 KDA. Mushi's global presence with Silencer gave Fnatic the right engagements and proper disengagements to take advantageous skirmishes. Mushi denied a game high 41 farm to go along with his team high damage, around 11,200. He also brought in the most gold, with 24,400.

As a result Fnatic took the opening game. In Game Two, Mushi used a safe lane Necrophos to some success, but Fnatic dropped the game. Mushi went 5/3/1 and stood out with his healing (2,200, most in the game). Mushi grabbed Sven in a safe lane for the series-deciding Game Three, as Fnatic took down Vici Gaming. Mushi posted a perfect game, going 2/0/4 and dealing a blistering 4,300 damage on the carry. He also racked up the most gold in the game with 16,400.

Resolut1on: Joins Digital Chaos

Name: Roman ""Resolut1on"" Fominok

Team: Digital Chaos

Update: Resolut1on will leave Team Empire for Digital Chaos, the North American team's website reports.

Analysis: Resolut1on will replace TC, who took over the carry role for Digital Chaos in August. The former Team Empire solo mid is considered one of the most accomplished players in the European circuit, having helped Empire qualify for The International in each of the last two years. It remains to be seen how effective he will be in a new environment, but Digitial Chaos has hinted more moves could be on the horizon -- making Resolut1on an interesting choice for fantasy purposes moving forward.

FEB. 13, 2016

Aui_2000: Puts up terrific assist numbers in Wednesday sweep

Name: Kurtis ""Aui_2000"" Ling

Team: Digital Chaos

Update: Aui2000 had a pair of active games in Digitial Chaos's sweep of EnemyGG on Wednesday as he ended with a KDA of 8/6/37 in the Captain's Draft League.

Analysis: In Game One, Aui, playing the roaming Earth Spirit found himself in the middle of seemingly ever altercation, ending the game having participated in 17 of 25 kills, while leading all players with 15 assists. In Game Two, Aui, again playing as a roaming Earth Spirit was vital for Digital Chaos as he was everywhere making plays happen -- participating in 28-of-41 kills and leading all players in assists with 22.

Loda: Terrific performance in series aids in sweep of Digital Chaos

Name: Jonathan ""Loda"" Berg

Team: Alliance

Update: Loda and Team Alliance put the clamps on Digital Chaos as they earn two game sweep in the Captain's Draft League.

Analysis: In Game One, Loda playing the safe lane Outworld Devourer, managed to play a flawless match, ending without a single death. Loda was also an important damage dealer for Alliance as he racked up the second most damage dealt (4,800). In Game Two, Loda, playing the offlane Omniknight, again had a mistake free performance, as he paved the way for Alliance on the back of his four kills and six assists.

s4: Aids in sweep of Digital Chaos during Captain's Draft competition

Name: Gustav ""s4"" Magnusson

Team: Alliance

Update: S4 put together a pair of dominant performances Monday, ending the series with a KDA of 18/0/14.

Analysis: In Game One, S4 playing the mid lane Leshrac had a flawless performance, ending the game with zero deaths, despite his active participation in the fights. S4 led the way for Alliance as he racked up the most kills in the match (11), while also leading in both the GPM (549) and XPM (642) charts. In Game Two, S4 again led Alliance to victory on the back of a second consecutive flawless performance. Playing the mid lane Tiny, S4 led all players in total kills with seven.

JAN. 31, 2016

Maybe: LGD breezes past Complexity Gaming in one game series in MarsTV League

Name: Yao ""Maybe"" Lu

Team: LGD Gaming

Update: Maybe carried LGD to an easy victory on the back of his 12/1/5 KDA.

Analysis: Playing the mid lane Outworld Devourer, Maybe led his team to victory as he outstripped all heroes with 12 kills, while participating in 17 of LGD's 24 total kills. Maybe managed to gain momentum early and didn't let up, quickly accruing a gold advantage that he would maintain throughout the game, ending it atop both the total gold chart (14,200), as well as leading his team in XPM (508).

Hao: Newbee serves up a dominating performance to win over EG in one game series at MarsTV League.

Name: Chen ""Hao"" Zhihao

Team: NewBee

Update: Hao was unstoppable -- crushing everyone in his path to amass a KDA of 17/3/15.

Analysis: Hao, playing the mid lane Outworld Devourer, seemed to do no wrong in Newbee's victory over EG. Leading all players in kills (17), Hao was also, by far, the most farmed hero in the game, amassing a total gold number of 37,300, while also leading all players in hero damage, racking up an insane amount, 21,700, over the course of the game.

Arteezy: EG earns hard fought victory in three game series versus LGD Gaming in MarsTV League

Name: Artour ""Arteezy"" Babaev

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: Arteezy put together a pair of strong performances in EG's two victories in the series, managing to post a strong KDA of 18/6/25.

Analysis: In Game One nothing was stopping Arteezy. Playing the safelane Morphling, Arteezy seemed to be in complete control of the match. Ending the game with by far the most kills (12), Arteezy was spectacular in Game One. In addition to his impressive kill numbers, Arteezy also found himself atop the farming statistics, leading in GPM (729) as well as XPM (649). Game Two, however, was a different story. Arteezy, playing the safelane Lone Druid, and the rest of the EG squad, just couldn't seem to gather their footing, as they were outplayed by the LGD in a Game Two loss. Game Three saw a return to form for EG and Arteezy, as he aligned once again with the safelane Lone Druid, providing valuable space around the map as he constantly pressured lanes and found his farm, ending the game with the second highest GPM (655).

Maybe: LGD continues their solid play as they earn victory in three game series versus Newbee, coming away with 2-1 series win

Name: Yao ""Maybe"" Lu

Team: LGD Gaming

Update: Maybe led the way for LGD in the series, posting a KDA of 18/4/18.

Analysis: In Game One Maybe was unstoppable, dominating the competition as he played the mid lane Queen of Pain. Maybe ended the game with a flawless KDA (10/0/10) and led all players with his 10 kills. Maybe was also the gold leader in Game One, amassing over 17,000 in the victory. Game Two was not a game to remember for the LGD squad, however, as they couldn't gain any momentum throughout the match. Maybe, playing the mid lane Razor, proved to be relatively ineffective, only managing to involve himself in two total kills. Game Three saw the resurgence of the Maybe from Game One, as the player again posted a flawless KDA(7/0/10), carrying his team to a decisive victory on the back of his safelane Gyrocopter.

Miracle: OG sweeps Team LGD as they continue dominant run through MarsTV League

Name: Amer ""Miracle"" Barqawi

Team: OG

Update: Miracle again leads OG to an easy series victory, paving the way with a KDA of 12/3/10.

Analysis: In an incredibly short Game One, with a total game time of only 26:09, Miracle's presence was felt throughout. Miracle, on the midlane Outworld Devourer, provided OG with a valuable damage dealer, racking up the second most total damage in the game (8,600). Miracle was very active throughout the course of the game, as he found himself involved in 11 of 22 total kills, snagging five of those kills for himself. In Game Two, Miracle, playing the safelane Morphling, again had another strong performance, as he led all players in kills (7), GPM (729), and XPM (507).

Miracle: Crushes Team Secret in MarsTV Dota League

Name: Amer ""Miracle"" Barqawi

Team: OG

Update: Miracle: Crushes Team Secret in MarsTV Dota League

In Game Two, Miracle playing as a mid lane Invoker, again made his presence known throughout all stages of the game. Not only did he top the gold charts with the most GPM (707), he also found himself leading in XPM (436), total kills (7), as well as Hero Damage, with over 11,000.

Analysis: In Game One, BigDaddy was a man on a mission, racking up the most total kills (12) as he controlled the game on back of his safe lane Tiny. BigDaddy, in Game One, managed to lead the way in nearly all statistical categories, including GPM (653), total gold (28,900), as well as total hero damage as he racked up over 15,000 points of damage. In Game Two, BigDaddy's performance dropped off slightly, but he still played well enough to carry his team to victory as he played a offlane Gyrocopter. He led the team in total kills again in Game Two, with 7, as well as leading in hero damage for the second straight game.

Team: Evil Geniuses

Update: Sumail, dominant as usual, posted a KDA of 27/5/29 in a kill-heavy series versus compLexity.

Analysis: In Game One, SumaiL playing the mid lane Invoker, seemed to be involved in everything, as he found himself apart of 27 of 31 total kills, by far the most active kill participant of any player. SumaiL also led all players with some gaudy farming statistics with a GPM of 644 and XPM of 588. In Game Two, SumaiL again played a very active role, this time taking part inin 29 of 42 kills and once again leading in both GPM (669) and XPM (713) to boot.

Analysis: In Game One, Arteezy playing the solo lane Nature's Prophet, made great use of his global presence, as he participated in 21 of 31 total kills, as well as claiming the second highest kill total in the game (9). Arteezy was also an important space provider, as his split pushing caused headaches for compLexity. In Game Two, Arteezy took over the reins as the safe lane Clinkz. He totaled the second highest amount of kills (12) as well as the second highest GPM (576) and XPM (622), on EG's way to a win over compLexity.

espn.com,,U.S. men secure 2 more wrestling spots in Rio,"['Johnette Howard', 'Espn Staff', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Adriana Terrazas', 'Bonnie D']","The U.S. men's freestyle wrestling team has secured spots in two more weight classes for the Rio Olympics.

Heavyweight Tervel Dlagnev qualified the U.S. for Rio at 130 kilograms (275 pounds) by winning gold Saturday at the Pan American Olympic Games Qualifier in Frisco, Texas. Tony Ramos gave the Americans a spot at 57 kilograms with a silver-medal performance. The U.S. has qualified in four of the six weight classes, with a chance to earn spots in the remaining two.

Jordan Holm qualified the U.S. at 85 kilograms in Greco-Roman by reaching the finals Sunday.

Competitors who earn spots in the finals of the Pan-Am Qualifiers qualify their nation, not themselves, to compete in Rio in that weight. American wrestlers will earn trips to this summer's games only by winning gold at the Olympic trials next month in Iowa City.

Jordan Burroughs (74 kilograms) and Kyle Snyder (97 kilograms) earned the U.S. spots for Rio by winning world championships last summer. The Americans will have additional chances to qualify weights for Rio in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, late next month and in Istanbul in early May.

They had hoped to secure a full lineup for Rio before the trials, but Brent Metcalf and Jake Herbert failed to reach the finals this weekend.

""We're going to have to get on the road and take care of business,"" U.S. men's freestyle coach Bruce Burnett said. ""We can make that happen. We have the athletes. We have the coaches. Now we just have to go get it done. We came up a little short here, but we're not going to let it happen again.""

Metcalf appeared poised to earn the U.S. an Olympic spot at 65 kilograms. But a takedown that Burnett believed should have been awarded to Metcalf in the final 15 seconds of his quarterfinal match with Puerto Rico's Franklin Gomez wasn't called.

Metcalf was out of challenges, and he wound up losing 9-7.

""It was an injustice,"" Burnett said. ""Brent showed great character in dealing with it the way he did.""

The U.S. women's team still has some work to do after a disappointing weekend in Texas.

The Americans earned an Olympic spot Friday at just one weight, 63 kilograms, as Erin Clodgo was awarded the gold after Brazil's Lais Nunes de Oliveira forfeited. But four other U.S. wrestlers were beaten before the finals.

""We had that big goal of getting all the weights qualified. It didn't happen,"" U.S. women's assistant coach Erin Tomeo said. ""It wasn't our best day.""

The U.S. qualified for Rio at 75 kilograms when Adeline Gray won a world title last year in Las Vegas.",[]
espn.com,,Who will fill the emerging hole on the WTA Tour?,"['Niall Seewang', 'Greg Garber', 'Mark Hodgkinson', 'Nic Atkin', 'Peter Bodo', 'Pa Sport', 'Bonnie D', 'Espn Com', 'Espn Staff', 'Jim Caple']","NEW YORK -- Until now, 28-year-old Maria Sharapova could be counted on to fill in what gaps perennially top-ranked Serena Williams might have left open.

But early this week, Sharapova shocked sports fans worldwide when she announced she had failed a drug test at the Australian Open, leading to her provisional suspension effective March 12. As it stands, Sharapova's future is uncertain.

As for Williams, she is facing her own challenges, having played just one tournament so far this year as a result of a knee and upper-respiratory ailments.

These developments raise the question: Is the WTA melting down and about to lose all its leaders and bankable Grand Slam stars?

Serena Williams has played only sparingly since last fall. Vincent Thian/AP Photo

""I'm not concerned,"" Williams said at a news conference promoting her exhibition match against Caroline Wozniacki at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday. ""We have a lot of great stars on the WTA Tour, a lot of people that play great tennis, a lot of great personalities like Caroline. We need that. We need those stars. We have a lot of players, a lot of U.S. players, and I think when the time comes, someone will definitely step up and be that leader.""

True, every year somebody is going to win Wimbledon, the US Open and every other event. Whether that player(s) will do it convincingly and consistently, and in a way that generates interest, is another matter. So far, the players who seemed on the cusp of breaking through to true stardom have crashed, a trend that, ironically, goes all the way back to Wozniacki.

She finished No. 1 in the world for two consecutive years (2010 and 2011) without winning a Grand Slam event, a shortcoming that led to a lot of criticism. These days the consistency that enabled Wozniacki to pull off her singular rankings feat looks impressive.

While Wozniacki might not be the one to fill this emerging hole on the WTA Tour, perhaps one these other players will. Let's take a look:

No. 2 Angelique Kerber

She will want to show that her win in Australia was no fluke.

However, the aftermath from that championship has been inauspicious for Kerber. In the following event, she lost to No. 73 Saisai Zheng in Doha.

""I think you have days like this sometimes,"" Kerber told the press after that loss. ""I don't know how many mistakes I did today. This is not my game; that's all I can say.""

No. 3 Agnieszka Radwanska

She lost the 2012 Wimbledon final to Serena and reached No. 2 thereafter. Since then, she's had fluctuating results. Her existence in the tennis landscape was best captured by the comment she made after she won the 2015 WTA Finals in Singapore, becoming the first women to lose two round-robin matches and claim the trophy.

""A few weeks ago, I didn't even know I'd have a chance to be here, and there you go,"" Radwanska said to the press at the time. ""It's the greatest day of my life.""

No. 4 Garbine Muguruza

Many pundits invest a lot of hope in Muguruza as the next best hope for the WTA. At 22, she's the youngest reasonable candidate. She beat Serena at the 2014 French Open and lost to the world No. 1 in the 2015 Wimbledon final.

Muguruza played well for the rest of 2015, but she's off to a so-so start this year. Her combination of size, mobility and easy power seems ideal for today's game. Still, Muguruza faces the same challenge as many of the other 20- 25-year-olds on the tour: That is figuring out just what to expect of themselves in a culture of lowered expectations.

No. 5 Simona Halep

Her aversion to the pressure of expectations seems to be as much a part of her game as those wonderful wheels on which she motors around the court on a good day. Halep promised a great deal when she played a great French Open final against Sharapova in 2014. But Halep has failed to get as far as the third round in half of the six majors since and has played some truly disappointing big matches.

No. 9 Petra Kvitova

Editor's Picks Complete coverage -- Latest from Sharapova's failed drug test Serena Williams and Caroline Wozniacki appreciate Maria Sharapova's candor in failing a drug test but explain that the Russian star should have been more diligent.

She owns two Wimbledon titles (2011 and 2013). Just 26, she may have more upside than any of the other contenders. The problem for the six-foot lefthander is that she tends to simply fall off the radar for long periods and still has a tendency to go to pieces against a player of any level at any time.

No. 12 Venus Williams

A 35-year-old icon, she doesn't appear like she'll ever be a factor in a major tournament. Venus hasn't played in a Grand Slam singles final since 2009. However, she will generate a lot of headlines this week as she returns to Indian Wells for the first time in 15 years.

No. 15 Victoria Azarenka

She looked like a major threat to Serena's dominance when the Belarussian won back-to-back Australian Open championships in 2012 and 2013. Injuries, a complicated personal life and a knack for losing rather than gaining traction at the most of critical times have turned her into something of an enigma.

This was never more apparent than at the Australian Open earlier this season.

""Mentally I didn't commit myself enough today,"" Azarenka said after falling to Kerber in the quarterfinals. ""I didn't push myself into making a difference. I was too flat.""

Others, including former Grand Slam champs such as Samantha Stosur and Ana Ivanovic, have seen their hopes fade. Sabine Lisicki's big serve carried her to the Wimbledon final in 2013 but fell apart when she met fellow surprise finalist Marion Bartoli (who has since retired). Lisicki hasn't really been the same since.

It could be especially beneficial to the WTA at this moment if one of these contenders not only located her game but held on to it in the coming weeks and months.",[]

Sportswear giant Nike, Swiss watch brand Tag Heuer and German luxury car company Porsche moved quickly to distance themselves from the five-time Grand Slam winner after she announced the positive test at a news conference in Los Angeles on Monday.

""We are saddened and surprised by the news about Maria Sharapova,"" Nike said in a statement. ""We have decided to suspend our relationship with Maria while the investigation continues. We will continue to monitor the situation.""

TAG Heuer said its deal with Sharapova will not be renewed. The sponsorship expired at the end of 2015 and discussions had been taking place on how to extend it.

""In view of the current situation, the Swiss watch brand has suspended negotiations, and has decided not to renew the contract with Ms Sharapova,"" TAG Heuer said in a statement.

Porsche said in a statement Tuesday that it has ""chosen to postpone planned activities"" with Sharapova ""until further details are released and we can analyze the situation.""

Sharapova said she failed a doping test at the Australian Open in January for the little-known drug meldonium, which became a banned substance under the World Anti-Doping Agency code this year. The former world No. 1 took full responsibility for her mistake and could face a lengthy ban from the International Tennis Federation, possibly ending her season and preventing her from competing for Russia at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.

""I know that with this, I face consequences,"" Sharapova said. ""I don't want to end my career this way, and I really hope I will be given another chance to play this game.""

Ford: Sharapova's admission brings doping issue to forefront Maria Sharapova's admission to a failed drug test again highlights the debate of doping and sport, and it casts a bigger spotlight on the issue in tennis. 1 Related

The 28-year-old Sharapova said she has been taking meldonium, a blood flow-promoting drug, for 10 years for numerous health issues. Meldonium was banned because it aids oxygen uptake and endurance, and several athletes across international sports have already been caught using it.

Sharapova and all players were notified of the changes in the WADA banned substances list in December. Sharapova claimed she simply missed the change, neglecting to click on the link.

""I take great responsibility and professionalism in my job, and I made a huge mistake,"" Sharapova said. ""I let my fans down. I let the sport down that I've been playing since the age of 4, that I love so deeply.""

Serena Williams said on Tuesday that Sharapova ""showed a lot of courage"" in taking responsibility for the failed drug test, and that she ""hoped for the best"" for Sharapova.

Sharapova is one of the top female players of her generation, with 35 career singles titles and over $36 million in career earnings. That earning potential is thought to be easily dwarfed by the earnings she generates from her commercial appeal.

Sharapova is thought to be the world's highest-paid female athlete due to endorsement deals and her extensive business ventures, including a high-profile candy line, Sugarpova. Forbes estimated her earnings at $29.5 million for 2015.

""She's a one-woman marketing machine,"" said Nigel Currie, an independent British-based sponsorship consultant. ""There are lots of male stars in the world, but not many female stars.""

Currie said it's ""unbelievable"" how such a mistake could have happened since Sharapova has such a big support network, adding that it's also ""amazing"" how quickly sponsors react.

""They are paranoid about their image, and the slightest risk to their image, they run to the hills,"" he said.

espn.com,,NHL -- Real reasons for the death of Bill Masterton highlight concussion issue,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Dan Marrazza', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Sean Allen', 'John Buccigross', 'Sarah Goldstein', 'Scott Burnside', 'John Rosengren', 'Paul Grant']","Bill Masterton, the only player to die from injuries suffered during an NHL game, might not have died in vain. The underlying cause of his death almost 50 years ago elevates awareness about the risks of undiagnosed concussions -- and the NHL's responsibility to address them.

On that fatal night at Met Center on Jan. 13, 1968, the Minnesota North Stars center, playing against the Oakland Seals, carried the puck across the blue line and cut to the right while Seals defensemen Larry Cahan and Ron Harris closed in. One of their sticks tangled with Masterton's skates as he slid a pass to his wing, and he lost his balance, pitching forward. He didn't see the other defender, who caught him with a clean check that knocked him backward. Masterton, who was not wearing a helmet, smacked the back of his head on the ice. ""It sounded like a baseball bat hitting a ball,"" teammate Andre Boudrias recalled.

Ken Lindgren, a fan watching the play about 10 rows up in the stands just above the blue line, can still visualize the impact.

""We watched his head bounce,"" Lindgren said. ""He didn't move after that. It got deathly quiet.""

Boudrias helped the team's trainer onto the ice to tend to Masterton. The team doctor soon joined him. They carried Masterton off on a stretcher, and an ambulance rushed him to Fairview Southdale hospital, seven miles away.

""His eyes were gray at the time -- it was like a horror picture,"" Boudrias says. ""I knew he was done.""

A team of doctors at the hospital treated Masterton with steroids and diuretics, but the swelling in his brain was so swift and severe that they decided against operating.

Realizing he was already gone, Masterton's parents, who had flown in from Winnipeg after they heard of the incident, and his wife, Carol, made the decision to remove Masterton from life support. At 1:55 a.m. on Jan. 15, 1968 -- almost 30 hours after he struck his head on the ice -- Bill Masterton died at the age of 29.

Seven hours later, when the Hennepin County medical examiner performed an autopsy, they discovered the true cause of Masterton's death.

Like many Canadian boys growing up in the '50s, Masterton listened to Saturday night radio broadcasts of ""Hockey Night in Canada"" and dreamed of Foster Hewitt making the call: ""Masterton shoots, he scores!""

That dream carried him through junior hockey in his hometown of Winnipeg and three years at the University of Denver, where he was an All-American and led the Pioneers to the 1961 NCAA championship, but the dream stalled after two years of minor league hockey in the Montreal Canadiens' organization. He finished with a master's degree in business at Denver and landed a job at the Minneapolis-based technology company Honeywell, where he worked in the financial department for the Apollo project, married his high school sweetheart and started a family, adopting a son and a daughter.

The NHL's expansion from six to 12 teams in 1967-68 rekindled his mothballed dream. He had kept fit by playing on a barnstorming amateur team, the St. Paul Steers, and with the U.S. national team. When Minnesota executives, who had acquired his rights, invited him to a tryout, Masterton relished the second chance. He made the North Stars and scored the first goal in franchise history.

Masterton was not a marquee player, but he was a skilled playmaker who was willing to work in the corners and be a team player. Murray Williamson, who coached both amateur teams Masterton played for, remembered a night in Rochester, Minnesota, when Masterton backed into a radiator in the dressing room and singed his rear end. ""He played that game standing up,"" Williamson said. ""He was a team man off the charts.""

Masterton was soft-spoken and modest, a quiet guy with a good sense of humor. He cherished his son, Scott, 3, and daughter, Sally, 1.

In the week before his last game, Masterton had complained to his wife and several teammates about headaches. He had been checked hard into the glass -- less yielding in those days -- two weeks earlier in a game against the Boston Bruins. He bore the bruises of that hit and others in subsequent games -- on his left arm, both thighs and, unwittingly, his brain.

The night before the Oakland game, Masterton's family gathered at the house of their neighbor, North Star goaltender Cesare Maniago, to celebrate Maniago's 29th birthday. Masterton told his friend that he had been having migraines.

Masterton had not told the North Stars' coach, Wren Blair, about his headaches, but Blair had thought something might be amiss and commented to the team trainer, ""I wonder if we could have him checked,"" according to the Toronto Star, which first reported this story on May 28, 2011.

Bill Masterton was rushed to hospital after suffering a suspected second concussion in a matter of days. B Bennett/Getty Images

They didn't. But even if they had, he might still have been in the lineup against Oakland.

""You know the diagnosis of a concussion back in those days?"" asked Williamson, who has a photo hanging in his office of Masterton on the stretcher. ""You hold out four fingers. If the guy only sees two, you send him back out there because it doesn't matter anyway.""

Masterton was an unfortunate victim of the ignorance of his time. Even as Walter Bush, one of the North Star owners, saw him lying motionless on the ice, he did not think Masterton had sustained a concussion. ""We didn't really know concussions in those days,"" said Bush, now 86. ""I'd been knocked out myself playing football. We didn't think it was that serious.""

Awareness about brain injuries and how to treat them has come a long way since then. So has NHL protocol, initiated in 2011, which has spotters to flag potentially concussed players and bans those from returning to games in which they were injured. But that has not happened fast enough for a group of more than 120 ex-NHL players, including Bernie Nicholls, Mike Peluso and Steve Payne, who are suing the league in a class-action suit for putting their neurological health at risk despite knowing the violent play involved. They and many others claim the league could be doing more to protect its players from returning to action too soon.

Yet players such as Masterton learned to play hurt. That's what men did. That was the NHL's code. And in Masterton's case, it probably cost him his life.

The Hennepin County medical examiner found evidence of a previous injury on the left side of Masterton's skull on the temporal region of the brain. States the autopsy report: ""There was a blow to the left temple in a game some days prior to the fatal injury and the deceased is said to have complained of headaches in the left temporal region.""

When Masterton's head struck the ice at Met Center, there was no skull fracture, but his brain swelled very quickly, evidenced by his dilated pupils and elevated blood pressure -- which pointed to a previous head injury.

""I am convinced he had some type of concussion beforehand,"" said Dr. Jesse Corry, a specialist in neurocritical care at the John Nasseff Neuroscience Specialty Clinic in St. Paul who studied the autopsy report. ""What killed this man was second-impact syndrome.""

Corry confirmed the opinion of Dr. Charles Tator, a Toronto neurosurgeon quoted in the Toronto Star article, who also said Masterton showed signs of ""second-impact syndrome."" When the brain hasn't healed completely from a previous injury, a subsequent blow can cause the type of sudden and severe swelling found in Masterton's brain.

Corry does not think the amount of swelling would have been caused from the singular impact at Met Center. Nor did he see evidence of CTE, the progressive degenerative disease found posthumously in the brains of nearly 87 of 91 NFL players who suffered multiple blows to the head. ""It is very rare to see that level of swelling in the brain from a single injury,"" he said. ""[Masterton] probably had some earlier swelling going on, so if he got a second injury, it would be catastrophic.""

The specter of Masterton's death hung over the NHL All-Star Game, which was played in Toronto the next day, Jan. 16, 1968. Talk centered on the divisive topic of helmets.

Masterton had worn a helmet when he played college hockey in Denver because NCAA regulations required players to wear them, but he did not wear one as a professional. Only a handful of NHL players wore them at the time, including Masterton's teammate, Boudrias. ""You protect your elbows, hips, knees and hands, I figured, why not protect your head?"" said Boudrias, now 72.

Andre Boudrias, one of the few players in 1968 to wear a helmet, believes wearing one would have saved Bill Masterton's life. Denis Brodeur/NHL/Getty Images

It took the NHL more than a decade to catch up to Boudrias' logic. For the 1979-80 season, the league finally made helmets mandatory for new players -- allowing those who signed professional contracts prior to June 1, 1979, the option not to wear them -- but it would be 18 years before every NHL player complied.

In 1968, Boudrias was the only North Star who wore a helmet. Typical of the attitude of the day, North Stars coach Wren Blair frowned on the practice. He and others considered it a sign of weakness. They thought it took away from the fan experience, masking the identity of players. ""I was asked to take it off,"" Boudrias said. ""I wouldn't do it.""

The following season, Blair traded Boudrias, who had scored the second-most points for the team in its first season, citing a drop in his production. Boudrias is convinced his insistence on wearing a helmet factored into Blair's decision. He's also convinced a helmet would have saved Masterton's life.

""There's no doubt in my mind about that,"" Boudrias said.

Yet that might not actually be the case. Since Masterton was off balance at the time he got checked (cleanly; there was no penalty called), his brain twisted inside of his skull before his head struck the ice. That rotation was a contributing factor in the severity of his injury.

""Helmets are great to absorb blunt impact, but when the brain is spinning, helmets don't help the spinning contents slow down,"" Corry said.

A helmet obviously would not have hurt Masterton, but it might not have been enough to spare his life, given the nature of his injury and the fact he had not healed from a recent concussion.

The Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy is awarded to players who show perseverance, courage and sportsmanship. Dominic Moore won the award in 2014. Andre Ringuette/NHLI/Getty Images

""It's kind of good to hear that because it takes away some of the 'What if?'"" said Masterton's son, Scott, now 50. ""We lived with the accident for many years but did not talk about it.""

After Masterton's death, the North Stars set up a scholarship fund in his name. The team also retired his No. 19, a tradition the franchise continued to honor when it moved and became the Dallas Stars.

Back at the 1968 All-Star Game, discussion among beat writers went beyond the helmet debate to come up with a way to commemorate the league's first casualty. The Professional Hockey Writers Association proposed -- and the league immediately approved -- the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy to be awarded annually to the player who best exemplifies the virtues of perseverance, courage and sportsmanship that Masterton displayed.

It's a fine tribute to a respected player who exhibited those virtues himself, but it's regrettable that it ever came to be. Corry believes Masterton's death could have been prevented -- and would be today.

""When he had headaches early on, we wouldn't have had him on the ice,"" he said.

espn.com,,Troy Tulowitzki is dead wrong in blaming Rockies' spring facility,"['Jerry Crasnick', 'David Schoenfield', 'Stacey Gotsulias']","This is fun: Troy Tulowitzki, still sounding bitter after the way last summer's trade from the Colorado Rockies to the Toronto Blue Jays went down, told USA Today that he prefers his new spring training home over the Salt River Fields facility in Scottsdale, which the Rockies share with the Arizona Diamondbacks. ""I like this place a lot better than Arizona,"" Tulowitzki said of the Jays' Dunedin, Florida, home. ""That place was like a country club. Guys got comfortable because it was so nice.""

Having been to all the spring training sites in Arizona, I will say this: The Salt River complex is gorgeous, a little slice of baseball heaven. It does feel like a country club, with spacious clubhouses, perfectly manicured practice fields and a sweet home stadium, with the two clubhouses located beyond the outfield. The Chicago Cubs' facility that opened last year in Mesa is stunning as well, except with one significant difference: Their clubhouse is cramped, much smaller than the other new facilities in Arizona, perhaps a deliberate move by the Cubs to improve team bonding.

Anyway, I guess Tulowitzki's implication is ... what? That the Rockies are losers because of their spring training facility? That they're not working as hard in spring training as other teams because of the country club atmosphere? OK, let's run with this. If there's something to what Tulo said, how would it show up? The Rockies would get off to a slow start, right? They wouldn't prepare themselves for the season, and the reality of regular-season baseball would expose that softness.

If the Colorado Rockies spring training facility is such a ""country club,"" why has the team consistently played so well in April? Jon Blacker/Getty Images

The Salt River complex opened in 2011. Here's how the Rockies have fared each season in their first 14 games, in April and over the entire season:

2011

First 14 games: 11-3 (.786)

April: 17-8 (.680)

Season: 73-89 (.451)

2012

First 14 games: 7-7 (.500)

April: 11-11 (.500)

Season: 64-98 (.395)

2013

First 14 games: 10-4 (.714)

April: 16-11 (.593)

Season: 74-88 (.457)

2014

First 14 games: 6-8 (.429)

April: 16-13 (.551)

Season: 66-96 (.407)

2015

First 14 games: 7-7 (.500)

April: 11-10 (.525)

Season: 68-94 (420)

Tulowitzki couldn't be more wrong. The Rockies have played better every April -- usually much better -- than they do over the course of the regular season. In those five seasons, they've gone 71-53 in April, a .573 winning percentage. That's the fourth-best win-loss record in the majors in April over that span, behind only the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals and Texas Rangers. After April, the Rockies have played .399 ball.

Back to the drawing board, Tulo. The Rockies have finished under .500 the past five seasons, but don't blame the spring training facility. This is why players don't always make the best analysts.

Anyway, that spread between April and the rest of the season is worth digging into deeper:

Offense, 2011-2015

April: .271/.333/.445, 5.0 runs per game

Season: .269/.325/.448, 4.6 runs per game

Defense, 2011-2015

April: .752 OPS, 6.9 SO/9, 4.5 runs per game

Season: .790 OPS, 6.9 SO/9, 5.0 runs per game

The offense scores about half a run less over the season than it does in April -- even with a minimal difference in its triple-slash line. Eight points of OBP isn't minor, although that's somewhat offset by additional slugging. Looks as if the Rockies have had better timely hitting in April. The pitching does get significantly worse, getting hit much harder and giving up an extra half-run per game. That could be a result of altitude attrition, that Rockies pitchers get hurt more often or get more fatigued due to pitching at elevation. Or it could simply be a reflection of a lack of pitching depth in the organization that every team needs -- even those who play at sea level.",[]
espn.com,,Chris Cooley doesn't hold back with RG III comments,"['Vaughn Mcclure', 'Tory Barron', 'David Newton', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Eric Williams', 'Josh Weinfuss', 'Jim Trotter', 'Kevin Seifert', 'Ben Goessling', 'Mike Reiss']","Chad 'Ochocinco' Johnson and Ryan Clark comment on former Redskins TE Chris Cooley criticizing former teammate Robert Griffin III for never being willing to be friends with Redskins QB Kirk Cousins. (1:44)

Robert Griffin III's journey from savior of D.C. to bench-warmer and object of public ridicule, is a saga that will puzzle Redskins' fans for years to come. Now that the quarterback's time with the team has finally ended, one of his ex-teammates attempted to shed some light on the situation -- or at least his take of what went down.

Chris Cooley, current ESPN 980 radio host and former tight end for the franchise, detailed RG III's failure to bond with Kirk Cousins and other shortcomings. Dan Steinberg of The Washington Post wrote up a detailed and compelling account of it all. But here are some excerpts of Cooley's comments:

""From the moment Kirk was drafted, I think Robert had animosity towards him. A lot of people in this area hated that fourth-round pick; I don't think anyone hated it as much as RGIII hated it.""

Robert Griffin III and Chris Cooley were teammates during the Redskins NFC East title run in 2012. Rich Lipski/ASSOCIATED PRESS

Cooley went on to elaborate on Griffin's relationship with the offensive line and wide receivers, or lack there of:

""The offensive line did not like Robert Griffin, a lot of the receivers did not like Robert Griffin. The offensive line had a problem with Robert, because they were considered for a year-and-a-half or two years a terrible offensive line that couldn't protect a quarterback. A lot of that isn't true. A lot of that was Robert. A lot of the sacks were put on Robert. Want to believe it or not, they were, OK? Football-wise, they were: It was Robert.""

""Receivers didn't like playing with Robert, because they didn't get the ball,"" Cooley said. ""It was never consistent, other than a couple in 2012; they struggled with that. So they didn't like Robert. ... ""

Ouch. More or less Cooley told the world the two most vital position groups for a quarterback to be in sync with didn't like Griffin. Isn't the first rule of being a quarterback buttering up your offensive line? Happy line, happy quarterback ... or something like that.

But before RG III's name is further tarnished, we should acknowledge that at least one prominent former teammate doesn't share Cooley's sentiments. Three-time Pro Bowler Brian Orakpo came to his defense on Twitter posting:

""Get this BUM Chris Cooley off the radio and tv please ... don't worry still got property in VA when I see him Im'a smack the s--- out of him.""

And the saga of RG III continues.

espn.com,,World Series of Poker schedule,"['Dave Tuley', 'Ryan Feldman', 'Tim Fiorvanti', 'Bernard Lee']","It may have come a little bit later than in previous years, but the wait for the 2016 World Series of Poker schedule is finally over -- and there's plenty to be excited about in this year's 69-event slate.

All of the big tent-pole events are back for the 2016 WSOP (running from June 1-July 18), save for one -- and more on that later. There are eight brand new events making their debut this summer, widening the spectrum of formats and buy-in levels, which range from $565 to $111,111.

Its hard to fathom that this event can continue to grow the way it has, said WSOP executive director Ty Stewart. But with the schedule weve put together for this year, we are confident 2016 will be another record-breaker at the WSOP.

There are also a significant number of key changes to the 47th edition of the WSOP. Most tournaments will now pay out 15 percent of the field, as opposed to the traditional 10 percent, and that will lead to far more tournaments reaching the money on Day 1. Perhaps one of the most dramatic changes for this coming summer is the adjustment of start times, which will be one hour earlier for all bracelet events and daily Deepstacks tournaments -- setting the starting times for most bracelet events at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.

By paying 50 percent more entrants and reaching the money earlier, we anticipate the 2016 WSOP to be the most rewarding yet, said WSOP tournament director Jack Effel, who will oversee the tournament for the eleventh straight year. Our schedule this year really runs the gamut for all levels of poker enthusiasts, so we hope you will peruse the events and make your plans to join us this summer at the Rio.

Highlights from the schedule release:

The Casino Employees no-limit hold 'em event will once again kick things off, getting underway Wednesday, June 1, and for the first time the tournament will allow a single re-entry.

Colossus II, the first open event of 2016, starts the following day (June 2) and features both $7 million prize pool and $1 million first place prize guarantees, with six starting sessions spread during three days.

Event 4, the first new event on the schedule, is called the 'Top Up Turbo.' It looks to reward players who play single table satellites both online on WSOP.com and at the Rio, as anyone who qualifies in one such tournament earns double the starting stack.

A $565 pot-limit Omaha tournament, the smallest-ever buy in for the game in a bracelet event, debuts in Las Vegas after appearing on the 2015 WSOP Europe schedule. Other similar new events include a $1,500 mixed pot-limit Omaha tournament and a $1,500 half no-limit hold 'em, half pot-limit Omaha event.

The Millionaire Maker returns with starting flights Friday, June 10 and Saturday, June 11. Both the winner and the runner-up are guaranteed at least $1 million. The Monster Stack is also back, with two starting days of its own (June 24 and 25).

The 'Summer Solstice' $1,500 no-limit hold 'em event, which features 90-minute levels, kicks off on the longest day of the year.

The biggest buy-in events are bunched toward the end of the summer; The $50,000 Poker Players Championship starts on July 3, the $25,000 pot-limit Omaha high-roller kicks off on July 6 and the $111,111 High Roller for One Drop is the last tournament to start before the main event, on July 8.

You may notice the one glaring absence from this schedule -- the biannual $1 million Big One for One Drop. Not to worry, say WSOP officials -- it will take place in 'grand fashion, but it won't be in Las Vegas as part of the summer schedule.' Speaking of One Drop, the main event will not be the last bracelet event of the summer for the first time in nearly a decade -- the Little One for One Drop holds that distinction in 2016.

For the first time in more than 20 years, a team bracelet event will be a part of the WSOP schedule. Teams of two to four players will put up a total buy-in of $1,000, with the ability for any inactive team member to 'tag-in' after a minimum of one orbit played by any of their teammates. Each of the players on a team will get their own bracelet.

There are some big changes in store for the main event as well. For 2016, main event players will receive 50,000 in chips -- the most ever given for this tournament (and the new standard for $10,000 events at the WSOP). Either 1,000 places or 15 percent of the main event field will get paid -- whichever of those numbers is bigger. The ante will kick in a bit earlier in the main event, too, changing the dynamic and strategy a bit.

As is the case for most other tournaments this summer, action kicks off at 11 a.m. each day, and players will once again have three starting flights to choose from -- Saturday, July 9, Sunday, July 10 or Monday, July 11. Day 2 will play out on either July 12 or 13, depending on starting session, and the field will combine completely on July 14.

The final summer day of the 2016 WSOP -- the day when the November Nine is set -- is July 18. Coverage of the main event will air toward the end of the summer, and they'll return to play out the final table of the 2016 WSOP main event live on ESPN airwaves from Oct. 30-Nov. 1.

espn.com,2015-05-20 16:54:51-04:00,Cancer Survivor Running Perimeter of U.S.,[],"Crashing on strangers couches, in her car, or, for one unusual evening, in an unoccupied room at an assisted living center, Neville has relied on others to help her complete each effort. A typical day consists of driving her sag wagon loaded with her belongings to the next segments finish line. Then her newfound friends, who had put her up in their house the night before, will drive her back to where shed left off the day before. For the next five to six hours, shell run the distance back to her car, carrying all the supplies she needs in a backpack.

Advertisement Advertisement

This leap-frogging process has taken her from Ocean Beach, California, to Atlantic Beach, Florida, in 2010, from Vancouver to Tijuana, Mexico, in 2013, and from Marathon, Florida, to Maine in 2014. Shes in the midst of her final leg now.

For the 54-year-old from Las Vegas, the reasons behind why shes chosen to cover a total of 9,715 miles over the course of more than 330 nonconsecutive days are deeply personal.

An 800-meter runner in high school, Neville admitted she never really considered herself a lover of long distances. That fact was true until 1998, when she signed up for the Chicago Marathon on a whim.

Five years earlier, Neville was diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma, a form of cancer that affects the immune system. In the years between her diagnosis and the day she registered for the marathon, she endured three brain surgeries and numerous rounds of chemotherapy and radiation treatments.

I was not in a great state of heath, and I wasnt sure if I would get better or keep having relapses, said Neville. Finishing the marathon, she said, was a means to prove her tenacity against the disease.

Her weakened body was only able to muster a total of six training runs; her longest run just six miles. But on race day, she lined up anyway. She remembers standing in the corral, listening to other runners trade stories about the training theyd just completed.

I just stood there praying that no one would ask me what my method was, she said.

Accustomed to spending eight hours on her feet at her nursing job, Neville figured she could finish in five hours.

Bolstered by the crowds, she crossed the line in 4:28.

Come the following summer, Neville was in remission. To make sure Chicago wasnt a fluke, she ran the San Diego Marathon. She chased that effort with 23 more marathons.

So when Neville set off for her first transcontinental run from Ocean Beach, on May 1, 2010, heading toward Atlantic Beach, Florida, her main mission was to inspire others to rethink the impossible.

There are so many people in every corner of every town who want to be a part of something, Neville said. Impossible to them obviously is not running around the perimeter, but it might be changing their diet or simply getting off the couch. I hope people see that the playing field wasnt level for me when I started, and Im still out here [running].

Along the way, she makes pit stops at hospitals, schools, cancer centers, and fire and police stations, telling her story while using her experience in the medical field to advocate for wellness.

As health professionals, were in the position to improve the health of the nation, she said. To do that, we need to improve the health of the citizens. People come to us for help, so I believe we should walk the walk of health, too.

Shes also used the time alone on the asphalt to cope with her own difficulties. During her first trek, she grieved the loss of her mother. Her cancer returned the following year, forcing her to postpone her second expedition for two years. Then in February 2013, her brother passed away. She carried his ashes in an urn in her backpack for her 1,500-mile run a few months later.

And while she hopes her journey will instill ambition in others, she said she has drawn inspiration from the individuals shes met along the way, too.

I set out to deliver happiness and hope on foot, she said. [Ive learned that] were different but nobodys better. I think that the human spirit is totally alive and well, you just have to be on the lookout. Im trying to expose whats right about the country. The inspiration has come full circle.",[]

espn.com,,Glossary of common betting terms,"['Espn Chalk Staff', 'Dan Graziano', 'Chris Forsberg', 'Wayne Drehs', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Bill Barnwell', 'Eric Williams', 'Royce Young', 'Jeff Goodman', 'Joe Mcdonald']","Action: Having a wager on a game.

ATS (""against the [point] spread""): If a team is 5-2 ATS, it means it has a 5-2 record against the point spread, or more commonly referred to simply as the ""spread.""

Backdoor cover: When a team scores points at the end of a game to cover the spread unexpectedly.

Bad beat: Losing a bet you should have won. It's especially used when the betting result is decided late in the game to change the side that covers the spread. Also used in poker, such as when a player way ahead in the expected win percentage loses on the river (last card).

Beard: Someone who places a wager for another person (aka ""runner"").

Book: Short for sportsbook or bookmaker; person or establishment that takes bets from customers.

Bookie: A person who accepts bets illegally and charges vig.

Buying points: Some bookies or sportsbooks will allow customers to alter the set line and then adjust odds. For example, a bettor might decide he wants to have his team as a 3-point underdog instead of the set line of 2.5. He has then ""bought"" half a point, and the odds of his bet will be changed.

Chalk: The favorite in the game. People said to be ""chalk"" bettors typically bet the favorite.

Circle game: A game for which the betting limits are lowered, usually because of injuries and/or weather.

Closing line: The final line before the game or event begins.

Consensus pick: Derived from data accumulated from a variety of sportsbooks in PickCenter. The pick, and its percentage, provides insight as to what side the public is taking in a game.

Cover: The betting result on a point-spread wager. For a favorite to cover, it has to win by more than the spread; an underdog covers by winning outright or losing by less than the spread.

Dime: Jargon for a $1,000 bet. If you bet ""three dimes,"" that means a $3,000 wager.

'Dog: Short for underdog.

Dollar: Jargon for a $100 bet. Usually used with bookies; if you bet ""five dollars,"" that means a $500 wager.

Edge: An advantage. Sports bettors might feel they have an edge on a book if they think its lines aren't accurate.

Even money: Odds that are considered 50-50. You put up $1 to win $1.

Exotic: Any wager other than a straight bet or parlay; can also be called a ""prop"" or ""proposition wager.""

Favorite: The expected straight-up winner in a game or event. Depending on the sport, the favorite will lay either odds or points. For example, in a football game, if a team is a 2.5-point favorite, it will have to win by three points or more to be an ATS winner.

Fixed: A participant in a particular game who alters the result of that game or match to a completely or partially predetermined result. The participant did not play honestly or fairly because of an undue outside influence.

Futures bet: A long-term wager that typically relates to a team's season-long success. Common futures bets include betting a team to win a championship at the outset of a season, or betting whether the team will win or lose more games than a set line at the start of the season.

Halftime bet: A bet made after the first half ended and before the second half begins (football and basketball primarily). The oddsmaker generally starts with half of the game side/total and adjusts based on what happened in the first half.

Handicapper: A person trying to predict the winners of an event.

Handle: The amount of money taken by a book on an event or the total amount of money wagered.

Hedging: Betting the opposing side of your original bet, to either ensure some profit or minimize potential loss. This is typically done with futures bets, but can also be done on individual games with halftime bets or in-game wagering.

High roller: A high-stakes gambler.

Hook: A half-point. If a team is a 7.5-point favorite, it is said to be ""laying seven and a hook.""

In-game wagering: A service offered by books in which bettors can place multiple bets in real time, as the game is occurring.

Juice: The commission the bookie or bookmaker takes. Standard is 10 percent. Also called the ""vig/vigorish.""

Layoff: Money bet by a sportsbook with another sportsbook or bookmaker to reduce that book's liability.

Limit: The maximum bet taken by a book. If a book has a $10,000 limit, it'll take that bet but the book will then decide whether it's going to adjust the line before the bettor can bet again.

Lock: A guaranteed win in the eyes of the person who made the wager.

Middle: When a line moves, a bettor can try to ""middle"" a wager and win both sides with minimal risk. Suppose a bettor bets one team as a 2.5-point favorite, then the line moves to 3.5 points. She can then bet the opposite team at 3.5 and hope the favorite wins by three points. She would then win both sides of the bet.

Money line (noun), money-line (modifier): A bet in which your team only needs to win. The point spread is replaced by odds.

Mush: A bettor or gambler who is considered to be bad luck.

Nickel: Jargon for a $500 bet. Usually used with bookies; if you bet ""a nickel,"" that means a $500 wager.

Oddsmaker (also linemaker): The person who sets the odds. Some people use it synonymous with ""bookmaker"" and often the same person will perform the role at a given book, but it can be separate if the oddsmaker is just setting the lines for the people who will eventually book the bets.

Off the board: When a book or bookie has taken a bet down and is no longer accepting action or wagers on the game. This can happen if there is a late injury or some uncertainty regarding who will be participating.

Over/under: A term that can be used to describe the total combined points in a game (the Ravens-Steelers over/under is 40 points) or the number of games a team will win in a season (the Broncos' over/under win total is 11.5). Also used in prop bets.

Parlay: A wager in which multiple teams are bet, either against the spread or on the money line. For the wager to win (or pay out), all of them must cover/win. The more teams you bet, the greater the odds.

Pick 'em: A game with no favorite or underdog. The point spread is zero, and the winner of the game is also the spread winner.

Point spread (or just ""spread""): The number of points by which the supposed better team is favored over the underdog.

Proposition (or prop) bet: A special or exotic wager that's not normally on the betting board, such as which team will score first or how many yards a player will gain. Sometimes called a ""game within a game."" These are especially popular on major events, with the Super Bowl being the ultimate prop betting event.

Push: When a result lands on the betting number and all wagers are refunded. For example, a 3-point favorite wins by exactly three points. Return on investment (ROI): In PickCenter, ROI is the amount (according to numberFire) that a bettor should expect to get back on a spread pick.

Runner: Someone who makes bets for another person (aka ""beard"").

Sharp: A professional, sophisticated sports bettor.

Spread: Short for point spread.

Square: A casual gambler. Someone who typically isn't using sophisticated reasoning to make a wager.

Steam: When a line is moving unusually fast. It can be a result of a group or syndicate of bettors all getting their bets in at the same time. It can also occur when a respected handicapper gives a bet his followers all jump on, or based on people reacting to news such as an injury or weather conditions.

Straight up: The expected outright winner of the money line in an event or game, not contingent on the point spread.

Teaser: Betting multiple teams and adjusting the point spread in all the games in the bettor's favor. All games have to be picked correctly to win the wager.

Total: The perceived expected point, run or goal total in a game. For example, in a football game, if the total is 41 points, bettors can bet ""over"" or ""under"" on that perceived total.

Tout (service): a person (or group of people) who either sells or gives away picks on games or events.

Underdog: The team that is expected to lose straight up. You can either bet that the team will lose by less than the predicted amount (ATS), or get better than even-money odds that it will win the game outright. For example, if a team is a 2-1 underdog, you can bet $100 that the team will win. If it wins, you win $200 plus receive your original $100 wager back.

Vig/vigorish: The commission the bookie or bookmaker takes; also called the ""juice."" Standard is 10 percent.

Wager: A bet.

Welch: To not pay off a losing bet.

Wiseguy: A professional bettor. Another term for a ""sharp.""",[]

espn.com,,72-10: Reliving the '95-96 Chicago Bulls,[],"Twenty years ago today, the Chicago Bulls played their 59th game of the season en route to winning an NBA-record 72 games. This is the highlight from that game against the Milwaukee Bucks. (1:28)

Twenty years ago, the Chicago Bulls embarked upon the greatest season in NBA history, winning a record 72 games by the time the regular season was over. Led by future Hall of Famers Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, the Bulls' average margin of victory was 12.3 points per game.

Jordan led the league in scoring, Rodman led the league in rebounding and Pippen did a little bit of everything in between. The Bulls racked up awards at the same rate they racked up victories: Jordan was the Most Valuable Player, Phil Jackson was the Coach of The Year, Toni Kukoc was the Sixth Man of the Year and Jerry Krause was the Executive of the Year.

Their season featured winning streaks of 13 and 18 games. They didn't lose back-to-back games until February. But this team was about more than on-court production. With Jordan at his marketing peak and the eccentric Rodman bringing reality show-type attention to the team, the Bulls turned into a cultural phenomenon. On the road, crowds waited outside their hotels at all hours just to catch a glimpse of the players. Local television news helicopters followed the team bus on its way to Milwaukee when the Bulls were on the verge of breaking the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers' previous record of 69 victories.

The Bulls capped off the season by beating the Seattle SuperSonics in the the NBA Finals, ensuring the team would go down among the all-time greats in professional sports. Throughout the year, ESPN.com will present a look back to that historic squad. -- J.A. Adande

The Wizards waived veteran guard Gary Neal, who is expected to miss at least three more weeks with quad and hip ailments, to create a roster spot to sign Thornton.

""Marcus brings experience and shooting to our backcourt and helps us fill a void caused by Gary's injury with another veteran player,"" Wizards president Ernie Grunfeld said in a statement. ""His skill set will allow him to fit right in to our system and give our offense another option.""

Thornton negotiated a buyout with the Houston Rockets before the March 1 deadline to ensure that he would be playoff-eligible for his next team.

The Miami Heat also had strong interest in Thornton but couldn't sign him for luxury-tax reasons after point guard Beno Udrih, whose contract the Heat bought out in February, went unclaimed on waivers.

Thornton joins trade-deadline acquisition Markieff Morris and recent signee J.J. Hickson as high-profile newcomers for the Wizards, who awoke Wednesday in 10th place in the Eastern Conference at 30-33, 212 games out of a playoff spot.

What are Russia and Finland's strengths and weaknesses?

@ESPN_Burnside: Greetings, all. Starting to feel a little World Cup of Hockey buzz? The hockey world awoke to the initial roster offerings for teams Russia and Finland, with all eight teams to announce their first 16 players before the day is over. For me, the biggest surprise was the Russian roster and the lack of big name KHL figures like Ilya Kovalchuk and Alexander Radulov. Kovalchuk has run afoul of coaches/management with his SKA team and was scratched for much their playoff series, but he was also the captain of the Russian Olympic team in Sochi, so it will be interesting to see whether his NHL/international experience is enough to earn him a spot when the 23-man rosters are filled out. The Finnish roster was as expected, though it was interesting to see Dallas defensive prospect Esa Lindell named, and you wonder whether the Finns will consider other young players like Petteri Lindbohm, a St. Louis prospect, or Kasperi Kapanen, who recently played his first game in the NHL with Toronto.

@CraigCustance: I love the firepower up front for Russia, but that defense has the potential to be a major weakness. I'm not sure how that's going to play against a powerhouse like Canada or even match up with the speed of Team North America, who can send out the likes of Nathan MacKinnon and Connor McDavid against the Russians. The silver lining is that Dmitry Orlov has developed nicely for the Washington Capitals under Barry Trotz and assistant coach Todd Reirden, so the Russians will be leaning on him in this tournament. Most of the World Cup contenders have a shutdown guy on the blue line, but I don't see a Ryan Suter or Aaron Ekblad or Shea Weber or Victor Hedman, or anything close, in that Russian group.

@Real_ESPNLeBrun: You called it right Craig: firepower. My goodness, look at those Russian forwards: Vladimir Tarasenko, Alex Ovechkin, Evgeni Malkin, Pavel Datsyuk, Evgeny Kuznetsov, Nikita Kucherov. Will there be enough pucks to go around? But here's a debate I'd like to have. Are we sure Sergei Bobrovsky and Semyon Varlamov are definitely better options in goal than Andrei Vasilevskiy? Bobrovsky's injury-plagued season has grounded him this year in Columbus. Varlamov has had an up-and-down season in Colorado. Vasilevskiy is stuck behind Ben Bishop in Tampa Bay, so he doesn't get the games he needs at this point, but I think he's a future NHL star. Would the Russians unleash him in Toronto in September? As for the Finns, their roster never overwhelms you, but all they do is go out and overachieve almost every time, like when they reached the final of the 2004 World Cup in Toronto before losing to Canada in a tight game, and when they won bronze in Sochi in February 2014. Never count out the pesky Finns.

@ESPNJoeyMac: As expected, Finland's roster is pretty much cut-and-dried. There weren't any surprises among the first 16 Finns named to the roster. Goaltending will be a strength with the Boston Bruins' Tuukka Rask and the Nashville Predators' Pekka Rinne. It's likely Columbus Blue Jackets rookie netminder Joonas Korpisalo, 21, could serve as Finland's third goalie. ""Yeah, of course,"" Korpisalo said recently when asked whether he wanted to participate in the World Cup. ""Everyone wants to be a part of the national team."" Defensively the Sabres' Rasmus Ristolainen, 21, will be relied on for major contributions. ""All the best players will be playing in that tournament and it should be fun,"" Ristolainen said. ""It means a lot. It means I've done something well to earn my spot there. It's always a great experience to play for Finland."" Finland is young on the blue line. Olli Maatta, 21, of the Pittsburgh Penguins should add some production. The Anaheim Ducks' Sami Vatanen, 24, needs to be better in the World Cup than he's been this season. Lindell is currently playing in the AHL for the Texas Stars. Offensively, the Finns have the potential to do some damage with the likes of Florida Panthers Aleksander Barkov and Jussi Jokinen, along with the Minnesota Wild's Mikko Koivu and Mikael Granlund, and the Blackhawks' Teuvo Teravainen. The Russian roster is an interesting one, especially between the pipes. I haven't talked with one player who isn't excited for the World Cup, and Wednesday's roster announcements are an indication of just how many of the best players in the world will be in the in September in Toronto.

Thananuwat Srirasant/Getty Images After winning in Thailand on Sunday, Lexi Thompson is ranked No. 3 in the world -- and looking like she will secure an Olympic spot this summer.

Lexi Thompson is doing everything she can to be a part of golf's big comeback at the Rio Olympics -- the first time the sport has been contested at an Olympics in 112 years. On Sunday, the 21-year-old Florida-native won her seventh career title (and a quarter-million dollars!) at the LPGA Thailand event in Chonburi. Her victory improved her world ranking from No. 4 to No. 3 -- just behind New Zealand's Lydia Ko and South Korea's Inbee Park -- and made her the top-ranked American.

To qualify for Rio, each country is allowed to bring up to four players if they are among the top 15 in the world on the cut-off date of July 11. Otherwise, participating nations can send only two players who aren't in the top 15. So as of right now, Thompson is in a very good spot to punch her Rio ticket.

We sat down with Thompson recently to discuss her plans for Rio and what it would mean to her to be part of golf's return to the world's biggest, most prestigious sport's stage.

Greg Mionske / Red Bull Lexi Thompson credits some of her success this year to new mental training strategies that include relaxation techniques.

Winning an Olympics would be better than any major. Any time I get to represent my country that's bigger than anything. Major championships are huge for us, obviously. But to say that you're an Olympian is the highest honor. I know we're all excited to have golf in the Olympics and that will be everyone's main goal this year -- to play well to make the Olympic team.

I feel like a veteran and I'm only 21. It's crazy to even say that. But now I have 18-year-olds right behind me. It's actually kind of nice not being known as the youngest out there now. They can get all the attention and I'll just do my own thing. I know what they are going through if they struggle. But honestly, neither Ko nor Brooke Henderson, both 18, have really struggled. That just shows how much the game has grown. Girls are just getting started younger, practicing more, realizing what it takes and are showing their talent.

I'm still putting in the hours. I'm practicing at least five hours a day, every day. I usually play a round of golf to keep score and make sure that I'm mentally ready for my tournaments. I'll do two hours of short game practice, too, while I'm out on the course. Afterward, I'll hit the gym and do a 30-minute warm-up, 30 minutes of cardio (stationary bike, treadmill, or StairMaster) and 30 minutes of strength training. Over the last year or so, I've put more cardio into my fitness routine to make it easier on my body. I also do a lot of golf-based exercises for balance, flexibility and rotation to improve my golf swing.

Music is my best training partner. I love working out alone and I don't usually need much motivation. I go to the gym, put my headphones on, and zone out for an hour and a half. I usually play the ""Hard Rock Strength Training"" station on Pandora. It's the best. It's upbeat rock and it's really good.

But my mental game may be the most improved. I started working with this life coach named John Denny down in Jupiter, South Florida over the last year. I met him through other players. He has helped me tremendously -- from being more positive on and off the course to breathing better when I play. It's crucial that my body is totally relaxed so that I can perform at my best.

Rob Snow / Red Bull In a nod to 1904, the last year that golf was in the Olympics, Lexi Thompson dressed up as an early-1900s golfer for a recent Red Bull ad campaign.

When we get together, he'll hook me up to a monitor to measure my relaxation. If I think about something that gets me hyped, my heart beat shoots up. When it starts to spike, he has me take a deep breath and think about something that makes me happy. I'll think positive thoughts like ""You're blessed"" or ""You're talented,"" and instantly see changes in my heart beat.

I put this breathing technique into my routine out on the golf course. Before I hit a shot, I'll visualize the shot I want to hit to get rid of all negative thoughts. I have to maintain a positive mindset because golf is 80 percent mental.

Golf is growing, especially on the women's side. The sport has grown a dramatic amount since I turned pro in 2010. We've gained tournaments, sponsors, a huge fan base, TV coverage and all that. I've seen the most growth happen in just the last two or three years. We're gaining money purses, too. Obviously not as much as the guy's tour, but we are gaining more sponsors -- and that's what we need.

All eyes are on us pre-Rio. Pro female golfers seem to be getting more hype than the guys right now. I'm not so sure why, but I think the media attention will even out once the Games begin. Golf in the Olympics, in general, is a big story. I think the men will be good about sharing the spotlight.

I was surprised by Rio's Olympic golf course. It's a 72-hole four-day stroke play. I figured that course planners would have wanted a little more team involvement. I love team events. I've played my fair share. Unfortunately, playing individually won't create as much of a team bond as I feel the Olympics should be. But just being there, representing your country as an individual or team, is going to be amazing.",[]
espn.com,,"NHL -- After overcoming mysterious illness, Joseph Blandisi has found new life with the New Jersey Devils","['Pierre Lebrun', 'Dan Marrazza', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'John Buccigross', 'Scott Burnside', 'Paul Grant']","Unable to stand up because of a lack of balance. Difficulty walking in a straight line and a loss of peripheral vision. Trouble staying awake and walking up a flight of stairs.

These symptoms are more associated with a long night on the town than the day-to-day existence of a hockey player.

Unless your name is Joseph Blandisi, that is.

Two years ago, the 21-year-old New Jersey Devils rookie experienced all of these symptoms and more while playing for the Ontario Hockey League's Barrie Colts, and it had nothing to do with having too much fun.

In fact, all that Blandisi's doctors knew at the time was that his mystery ailment was in danger of ending his pro career before it really started.

""I think they gave me mono at first,"" said Blandisi, who has chipped in five goals and 14 points in his first 26 NHL games after being signed as a free agent by the Devils last winter.

""I started with mono and I was tired all the time. Just slept and watched TV a lot. 'One Tree Hill' and hockey. That's normal for mono and mono's a couple weeks. So that was fine. Then I started feeling a little better and put my skates on, but I couldn't skate. I was like, 'Oh, this is weird.'""

Editor's Picks McDonald: Connor McDavid-Jack Eichel hype isn't rare The rookie sensations and top two draft picks from last year faced each other for the first time, and it didn't disappoint. Just don't try telling them that.

What started as ""weird"" eventually became scary enough that the then-19-year-old Colorado Avalanche sixth-round draft pick thought his career was over. It would be more than seven months before Blandisi would play competitive hockey again, with doctors still unsure what his illness was.

""I thought I felt fine, but I guess something in my brain was messed up,"" Blandisi said. ""I thought they did something to my skates at first. I got my skates sharpened and went back out there and I still couldn't skate. I was out for three weeks with the mono and when I came back it was like I had never skated in my life.

""It slowly started getting worse. Even driving, I couldn't see out of my peripherals. I couldn't see in my blind spot unless I completely rotated my head. I couldn't balance on one foot. If I was sitting down for long periods of time and I got up, I'd fall over right away. When you'd see me in the dressing room, I'd be swaying.

""One time I came home and I caught my mom unexpected. She was there, just crying. She asked me, 'Are you ever going to get better?'""

For a while, this was a legitimate concern for Blandisi, who with his strange condition confounded doctors and scouts alike for months. It was as if Blandisi became one of the NBA stars whose talent was stolen by cartoon aliens in the movie ""Space Jam,"" with there being few traces of any physical problems in him except that he seemingly lost all of his athletic ability overnight.

""As a coach, I was more worried about his well-being and getting a proper diagnosis,"" said Dale Hawerchuk, Blandisi's coach in Barrie. ""Joe contracted a strange virus.""

Blandisi was eventually diagnosed with a coxsackie viral infection, a condition so rare that many doctors aren't exactly sure how to properly diagnose it, let alone treat it.

Dr. Joel Mendelson, a New Jersey allergist-immunologist who specializes in treating rare infections, said coxsackie is caused by a bacteria that produces a cough and a fever that lasts for a few weeks or several months. It usually goes away on its own but can be shortened by antibiotics. He added that there have been relapses, but overall the infection is very rare, with 200 cases a year in the U.S.

""It's typically acquired from animal contact -- farm animals can transmit coxsackievirus,"" he said. ""This is a disease that's not typically transmitted from person to person. The normal story with this is contact with goats, sheep, that kind of contact. It's more of a farming or rural illness.""

Considering that Blandisi grew up in suburban Toronto with his father working as a car salesman and his mother for a health and wellness company, it remains unclear how he could have contracted this rare disease. Blandisi, however, completely recovered, without medication, within six months and hasn't experienced any symptoms since.

Perhaps most unexpected is that Blandisi returned from his illness a better player. He previously had never scored more than 21 goals in a junior season, but Blandisi scored 52 with Barrie last season, leading arguably the most competitive junior league in the world in goals.

Blandisi continued his OHL success by speeding through an American Hockey League apprenticeship in Albany this fall, solidifying himself to become a key offensive contributor for a Devils team surprisingly in contention for a playoff spot.

""Going through what he went through has fueled his desire to succeed,"" Hawerchuk said. ""I always liked his skill set and now he took his work ethic to a new level, which provided him with on-ice results.""

Blandisi is the quintessential feel-good story, until you actually see him play.

Soft-spoken off the ice, the middle-sized winger is a nasty piece of business on the ice who has earned a reputation as a bit of a diver. First, a slight slash from Philadelphia Flyers defenseman Andrew MacDonald on Feb. 16 produced a (penalized) dive that would've made Greg Louganis proud. A week later, a light tap in the face from the New York Rangers' Dylan McIlrath produced similar (also penalized) results.

When asked after the latter incident of a scouting report comparing him to Steve Ott of the St. Louis Blues, Blandisi laughed.

""I don't know if I'd go that far,"" Blandisi said. ""Maybe more Brad Marchand.""

Oh, that's so much better.

Although, for a player who couldn't stand on his own two feet two years ago, a reputation for occasionally falling down on purpose is quite better.",[]

The Sydneysider showed enormous heart to win the belt from the title holder making his second defence, coming back from a disastrous sixth round in which he was cut and knocked down by the southpaw from Uzbekistan. The 36-year-old former MMA fighter and bouncer somehow survived the last 30 seconds of the round despite being wobbled a couple of times.

The Australian dug deep and landed several right upper cuts to take the seventh round in a stirring comeback.

Chagaev, 37, regained his composure and probably shaded the next two rounds but Browne sent shockwaves through the division when he caught Chagaev with a crunching right to the head inside the last minute of the 10th round, depositing the champion on the canvas.

Browne sensed an opportunity to finish the fight there and then, landing several more right-hand shots to Chagaev's head before experienced South African referee Stanley Christodoulou stopped the fight.

Browne, who improved his record to 24-0 with 21 KOs, showed he was much more than a big puncher as he delivered on his pre-fight promise to box and move. He pinged the champion with jabs through the early rounds and landed the occasional right hand in winning the so-called regular version of the WBA belt; Britain's Tyson Fury is the WBA's ""unified"" champion since he also holds the World Boxing Organisation title.

espn.com,,Notes: Provodnikov vs. Crawford or Cotto?,['Dan Rafael'],"A few notes from around the boxing world:

Top Rank promoter Bob Arum said immediately after junior welterweight titleholder Terence Crawford knocked out Hank Lundy in the fifth round Saturday night in New York that he hoped to bring him back in late June or July to face former titleholder Ruslan Provodnikov at the Forum in Inglewood, California. Before Saturdays fight, Arum spoke to Artie Pelullo, Provodnikovs promoter, about the possibility of the fight. Pelullo said that he liked the idea and that they could talk more assuming Crawford won. Pelullo told ESPN.com this week that he hopes to wrap up the HBO bout with Arum even though Provodnikovs name has been raised as a possible June 18 opponent for Miguel Cotto on HBO PPV. Pelullo said he has not been contacted about a Cotto-Provodnikov fight, although he would be open to it if the Crawford fight doesnt work out. However, Roc Nation Sports, Cottos promoter, has said that in order to make the fight Pelullo would have to drop a lawsuit that he brought against the company for allegedly interfering with his deal with former junior middleweight titleholder Demetrius Andrade. Pelullo said he has no intention of dropping the suit but would be willing to work on the fight during litigation.

Australian heavyweight contender Lucas Browne (23-0, 20 KOs), 36, will be a long way from home when he challenges secondary titlist Ruslan Chagaev (34-2-1, 21 KOs), 37, a southpaw from Uzbekistan living in Germany, for his belt on Saturday (AWE, 2 p.m. ET) in Grozny, Russia. But even though Browne will have little support in the crowd, he said he is buoyed knowing I've got 24 million Australians back home supporting me. I don't think about not winning. I've trained to win and that's what I'm here to do. I dont want to let my countrymen down. I've had three months away from my family. It's been very hard but it's going to be worth it.

espn.com,,Rory McIlroy's new putting stroke looks familiar,"['Bob Harig', 'Pa Sport', 'Jason Sobel']","Rory McIlroy (-8) is two shots back of Adam Scott for the lead at the WGC-Cadillac Championship after the second round. (1:43)

DORAL, Fla. -- Rory McIlroy was worried.

Not scared, not frightened. Just worried.

In the days leading up to this week's WGC-Cadillac Championship, he was changing the grip on his putting stroke, and that got him thinking about the potential backlash.

Let's not confuse the message here: He wasn't worried about how switching to a left-hand-low style would negatively impact his performance. He'd been working on this method in practice sessions for a while and had confidence in his ability to hole more putts in competition.

No, he was worried about inevitable comparisons to a certain fellow superstar.

""It's funny, I've been playing it around in my head a little bit about making the switch,"" he revealed. ""And the one thing that I was sort of worried about was the 'McIlroy copying Spieth.' That was my big thing. That was the whole thing for me.""

It takes a confident golfer to make such a switch in the prime of a burgeoning career. It takes a confident person to admit such insecurities in a public setting.

Each of those descriptions fit McIlroy perfectly, though -- as does the new putting style he has copied from Jordan Spieth.

As playing partners once again during Friday's second round, Spieth had a front-row seat to just how well his left-hand-low brother-in-arms could roll the rock using his new stroke.

McIlroy dropped eight birdies in a 7-under 65 that moved him within two strokes of leader Adam Scott entering the weekend. And more importantly, he needed just 23 total putts for the day.

""I felt like when I put my right hand on the grip, to square my shoulders up, my right hand got stronger and stronger -- that's why it got a little bit more active,"" he explained after the round. ""So to be able to put your hands on the grip and know your shoulders are perfectly square before you even try to hit a putt, knowing that your fundamentals and everything are set, it makes it much easier to not think about that and rock your shoulders and make a good stroke.""

Rory McIlroy adopted the putting style of Jordan Spieth heading into Doral, and it's paid off. Friday he was just one putt from the lowest single-round putting total of his career. Drew Hallowell/Getty Images

That doesn't mean the move is a magic elixir that will lead to instant success -- even if his second round tried to prove otherwise.

McIlroy's 23 putts were 10 fewer than the previous day. He was just one putt from the lowest single-round putting total of his career. He made just more than 100 feet worth of putts and ranked fourth in the field in strokes- gained putting.

All of which makes him very dangerous right now.

For a guy who rarely struggles from tee to green, McIlroy needs only to putt just above average to climb the leaderboard.

If that sounds familiar, it's a similar refrain as the guy he's chasing. Scott has overcome the anchored putting ban in spectacular fashion, finishing runner-up two weeks ago, winning last week and leading once again this week.

""You see what Adam's done, and Adam's worked really hard,"" McIlroy said. ""All of us out here, we're good enough to make anything work, as long as you believe in it and you trust it and you work hard enough at it. I think that's the thing. If I wanted to go to the claw, and I spend enough time at it, I could make it work. But this is the one that just feels really comfortable to me.""

Even before the tournament rounds started here at Trump National Doral's TPC Blue Monster course, McIlroy insisted this wasn't some quick-fix strategy that would be abandoned if there wasn't an immediate payoff.

Of course, with the Masters Tournament just five weeks away -- the one major keeping McIlroy from becoming the sixth player in history to claim the career grand slam -- this was always going to be a risky proposition.

McIlroy switches putting grip after missed cut Rory McIlroy revealed that he will be employing a left-hand-low grip on his putting stroke in competition for the first time since his initial professional season of 2008. 2 Related

So far, it's paying off in dividends, even if he tried to downplay the decision.

""I don't think it takes that much courage,"" he explained. ""In my mind, it couldn't really have gotten any worse. So why not make a change, and the change is feeling very comfortable at the minute. As I said at the start of the week, I'm willing to stick with it for as long as I can.""

This shouldn't come as a surprise, but McIlroy isn't worried any longer.

No, he's not worried about what everyone will say after he basically copied the style of putting favored by a fellow superstar who won two major championship titles last year.

As for Spieth, he doesn't mind the company.

At one point during their rounds together this week, he sidled up to McIlroy and the two of them discussed the left-hand-low stroke.

Before that conversation ended, Spieth smiled a bit and told him, ""You've switched to the dark side, I see.""

So far, McIlroy is realizing the power of this dark side.",[]

Anderson, 60, took over two years ago after Frank Haith left for Tulsa. He has gone 19-44 in two seasons in Columbia. Missouri has been 3-15 in SEC play in each of his two seasons.

There was speculation that Missouri athletic director Mack Rhoades might make a change, despite Anderson being on board for just two years.

Rhoades said Wednesday that he met with Anderson earlier in the week to share expectations for next season.

""No one is satisfied with the number of wins our team has earned in the past two seasons,'' Rhoades said. ""No one wants to win more than Coach Anderson.''

Rhoades said he expected Anderson to serve as a ""role model'' for students.

Anderson said he looks forward to the challenge of putting the school back on the map. He is a former star player and assistant coach under Norm Stewart at Missouri, which he said ""holds a special place in my heart.''

""Mack understands the challenges we've faced and has been very supportive,'' Anderson said.

Missouri self-imposed a postseason ban in January after admitting NCAA violations that occurred in the program on Haith's watch. The Tigers also vacated 23 wins from Haith's final season in Columbia. Haith left Missouri shortly after the school received a verbal notice of inquiry from the NCAA.

Anderson played his college ball at Missouri before being drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers in 1977. He also played in Italy and France. Anderson was an assistant at Missouri on two separate occasions before becoming the head coach at Central Missouri for 12 seasons. He won the Division II national championship in 2014.

Anderson signed a five-year contract when he was hired.

""No one is more disappointed than me, but no one is more motivated to get this program competing at a high level again,'' Anderson said. ""Our goal remains to compete and to win at the highest level and to do so with integrity and class.''

espn.com,,Mark Cuban embodies optimistic spirit of fantasy sports industry at FSTA,"['Darren Rovell', 'David Purdum']","David Purdum explains what DraftKings creating a designation for elite players and ban the use of offsite scripting to set multiple lineups will mean for all players. (2:04)

DALLAS, Texas -- There was no escaping the undercurrent of uncertainty that flowed through the Omni Hotel during the Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA) winter conference this week in downtown Dallas.

On stage, fantasy sports proponent Mark Cuban gave a confidence-boosting keynote speech, and officials for the FSTA laid out a plan of attack to protect an industry under fire. In the hallways, though, questions were more frank and often ominous: ""What's going to happen? Are DraftKings and FanDuel going to survive?""

""What I'm up here to tell you is that when things seem to be going against you and everybody seems to be ganging up on you, that's typically when the best (expletive) is about to happen,"" the ever-confident Cuban told an almost full auditorium Wednesday.

The tone of the conference was set well before Cuban took the stage wearing a hooded, grey sweatshirt for his keynote address. Editor's Picks DraftKings will ID experienced users in contests In a Friday announcement of changes to its contests, DraftKings instituted a ban on offsite scripts and said it will begin to identify and designate experienced players.

On Tuesday, the same day the event kicked off, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton released an opinion stating that daily fantasy sports is a form of illegal gambling under state law. Paxton is the sixth state attorney general to declare daily fantasy a form of gambling in the past four months, joining Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New York and Vermont. (Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey believes daily fantasy is a form of gambling, but is legal in her state. Massachusetts is reviewing proposed consumer protection regulations for the industry).

In Texas, Paxton's office declined to speculate on what legal action, if any, would follow the opinion. Cuban said he heard no suits would be filed. More states are reviewing the issue; some even want to make operating and/or advertising daily fantasy a felony. Plus, federal investigations are reportedly underway.

The intensifying controversy did not stop more than 450 attendees -- a record number, according to the FSTA -- from showing up in support of their embattled industry. The turnout was especially impressive considering the event's location was moved from Las Vegas to Dallas just four months ago. The site change was made in protest of Nevada's decision to require daily fantasy operators to obtain a gambling license to operate in the state.

""As an industry, we're going to battle and we're going to win,"" FSTA president Paul Charchian said in his opening remarks, noting that membership in the association had actually grown since the controversy over the industry erupted in September.

The FSTA's plan is to lobby to clarify the legality of fantasy sports in a 50-state battle. Attorney Jeremy Kudon said 75 lobbyists in 30 states are representing the industry. Nineteen states are considering fantasy sports bills, according to industry site LegalSportsReport. Charchian estimated it could be a two-to-three year battle, but hoped to come out with legal clarity in ""40ish"" states. Daily fantasy sports are currently prohibited in Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana and Washington.

""Right now is the time to fix all of this,"" said former Maryland Attorney General Doug Gansler.

It's a lot to fix, and some, like New York attorney Dan Etna, aren't sure a state-by-state approach is wise. Daily fantasy operators DraftKings and FanDuel are already in the thick of legal battles with attorney generals from Illinois and New York, two heavily-populated states attempting to shut down the industry leaders. And now the opinion by Paxton in Texas is looming over the industry's head.

""I think the DFS community is cautiously optimistic that the industry will overcome most of the legal uncertainty,"" said Dan Back, a respected industry voice who works at daily fantasy site RotoGrinders.com. ""It's hard to know for sure how it will shake down because the passage of legislation is a process that can often time take years to complete and the political machine is highly unpredictable. But it's clear that FanDuel, DraftKings and the FSTA are putting tremendous resources toward resolution.""

Charchian said the record turnout at the conference, in the face of the controversy, was reassuring.

""I think a lot of people were walking in wondering if they were walking into a morgue,"" Charchian said during a Friday phone interview after the conference. ""But one of the recurring themes I got from attendees was how happy they were that the energy and positivity and excitement that is sort of inherent in fantasy sports is all still there.""

Cuban's speech and interaction with the audience was a big part of that energy. He has invested in Sportradar, a European sports data provider with close ties to the fantasy sports and sports betting world, and FantasyLabs, an analytics site that provides tools to help daily fantasy players optimize lineups. Cuban acknowledged those investments, but said he could walk away from them without issue. He is more concerned about what he believes is hypocrisy from lawmakers and politicians going after the fantasy industry.

""I don't want to stand up here and say that I'm a fantasy sports expert. I'm not,"" Cuban said. ""I think I've played fantasy three times in 10 years. I'm not a DFS expert. I learned it was a game of skill because I realized how bad I sucked. But what I've gotten pretty good at over the past too many years is detecting hypocrisy, detecting stupidity and detecting conditional wisdom that makes absolutely no sense.""

Cuban remained adamant that he doesn't believe daily fantasy sports is gambling. But college professors Dr. Andrew Billings and Dr. Brody Ruihley, who presented later in the day after Cuban, found that belief contrasts what a survey of fantasy sports participants showed. The survey, which was distributed through FSTA outlets, asked: ""When money is involved, is fantasy sport gambling?"" Seventy-percent responded 'yes.'

""Gambling is accepted and gambling is a part of our culture,"" Cuban told reporters after his speech. ""If this is a step toward getting it regulated, formalized and even taxed a little bit, that's fine. This isn't 'no new taxes.' This isn't 'no new regulation. This should all be laissez-faire.' It was the exact opposite. It's an opportunity to do it the right way. But more importantly to get it out of the way so that there's a standardized set of rules that everyone knows to go by. And then fans can just enjoy what they want to play.""",[]

Puerto Rico's Roman ""Rocky"" Martinez was scheduled to make a mandatory title defense against Berchelt in his hometown of Merida on Saturday night but withdrew last week, citing tendinitis in his left hand.

According to Martinez promoter PR Best Boxing Promotions, Martinez's doctor told him to rest the hand for at least four weeks.

With Martinez out of action, Zanfer Promotions announced it had gotten the WBO to sign off on sanctioning the interim title bout for Berchelt (28-1, 25 KOs), 24, and Jupp quickly (13-2, 4 KOs) took Martinez's place in the bout. The card will air on beIN Sports Espanol in the United States beginning at 11 p.m. ET.

Jupp, 25, of England, is quite inexperienced, not having any name opponents on his record, but he has won nine fights in a row since a 2011 loss. He will be boxing in a scheduled 12-round fight for the first time.

When Martinez (29-2-3, 17 KOs), 33, is ready to return, he will be mandated to face the Berchelt-Jupp winner in his first fight back or he will be stripped of the belt and the Berchelt-Jupp winner will become the full titleholder.",[]

Werdum (20-5-1) has been pegged a minus-225 favorite to defeat Miocic at UFC 198 in Curitiba, Brazil. Miocic (14-2) comes back at plus-175. The bout will take place at Arena da Baixada, a 42,000-seat Brazilian soccer stadium.

Nick Kalikas of MMAOddsBreaker.com set the lines. Werdum is seeking his first heavyweight title defense. He won the belt as a more-than 3-to-1 underdog against Cain Velasquez in June.

espn.com,,Buccaneers wisely decide that re-signing Doug Martin was best option,"['Vaughn Mcclure', 'Mike Dirocco', 'John Clayton', 'Kevin Seifert', 'Mike Reiss', 'Jeremy Fowler', 'Michael Dirocco']","Mark Dominik explains what he saw in RB Doug Martin when he initially drafted him as GM of the Buccaneers, as well as how important it is for teams to re-sign their own players. (1:30)

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers did the right thing by re-signing Pro Bowl running back Doug Martin.

In a way, they almost had no choice.

The list of free-agent running backs wasn't impressive to begin with, and it got even less so when the Jacksonville Jaguars agreed to a deal with Chris Ivory on Tuesday night.

Matt Forte was available, but he's 30 years old and has averaged 315 touches per season in his eight-year career. Arian Foster was an option, too, and is a year younger than Forte, but he hasn't played a full season since 2012 and has missed 23 games over the past three seasons because of various injuries.

So the Bucs could have pursued Joique Bell, Reggie Bush, Bilal Powell, Lamar Miller or Alfred Morris, but none is -- at this point, anyway -- in Martin's class. They also could have decided to go with Charles Sims as their top back -- he rushed for 529 yards in 2015 -- and add another in the middle rounds of the draft.

None of those options is as good as retaining Martin, who finished second in the NFL in rushing (1,402 yards) last season. Negotiations came perilously close to the 4 p.m. ET deadline, at which point Martin would have become a free agent, but they eventually worked out an agreement after 2 p.m. ET.

According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, Martin agreed to a five-year, $35 million contract. The Bucs could have saved some money if they had exercised the fifth-year option in his rookie contract before the 2015 season, which would have given him a $5.6 million salary in 2016. However, Martin was coming off consecutive injury-plagued seasons in which he rushed for less than 500 yards, and picking up the option at that point didn't make sense.

The Bucs drafted Martin with the 31st pick in 2012, and he finished his rookie season with 1,454 yards and 11 touchdowns rushing and caught 49 passes for 472 yards and one touchdown. Martin was a finalist for rookie of the year and earned a Pro Bowl berth as a first alternate.

He missed a combined 15 games in 2013-14 because of a torn labrum in his left shoulder and ankle and knee injuries. He ran for 950 yards and three touchdowns combined in those two seasons.

Martin played in every game last season and averaged a career-best 4.9 yards per carry. He was a big reason the Bucs finished fifth in the NFL in total offense despite starting a rookie quarterback.

The Bucs smartly kept Martin around, and now the team's young trio of Martin, quarterback Jameis Winston and receiver Mike Evans remains as the offense's core for at least the next few seasons.",[]

Lewis Kent, a 22-year-old cross-country runner from the University of Western Ontario, broke his own world record with a time of 4:47:17 at the second annual FloTrack World Championships.

Defending champion and Manitoba postman Corey Gallagher closed ground but couldn't quite catch Kent and finished 2 seconds back.

Erin O'Mara, a 31-year-old from Fenton, Michigan, sprung a massive upset and smashed the previous world record by more than 8 seconds by running a 6:08:51, which suggests the women's 6-minute barrier could soon be eclipsed.

Gallagher, 28, broke Kent's previous world record with a time of 4:54.4 on Oct. 12, but Kent returned the favor and reclaimed the record five weeks later with a 4:51.9.

""I couldn't hear the splits during the race, but on the Jumbotron, you could see the people behind you,"" Kent told ESPN.com. ""Each time I came around the last corner, I'd say, 'S---, don't let Corey be there. And, damn, he was always there. I tried to drop him on the first lap, the second, the third. That's why the race was so fast. I was only concerned about getting the win today, but Corey gets a lot of credit for pushing me.""

Because of extenuating circumstances, it was an even more impressive run before an estimated 2,000 spectators than might have appeared.

Editor's Picks Beer mile record-setter Kent signs shoe deal Lewis Kent, who set the record for the beer mile on Tuesday, has signed an endorsement deal with running brand Brooks.

Kent taped a segment on ""Ellen"" Monday featuring a truncated beer mile -- three beers over 300 meters in 90 seconds -- against a show staffer, which ran Tuesday. Kent actually missed his plane from Los Angeles on Monday night and didn't get to Austin until Tuesday.

""The taping ran long, so I got up at 4 a.m. and flew at 6,"" Kent said. ""I went for a shakedown run when I got there, then took a two-hour nap. I didn't think there was any chance for a record. I don't know how it happened, but it happened.""

Kent pockets $5,000 for winning the race and setting the record, plus he gets an undisclosed bonus from Brooks, his new sponsor.

Gallagher, meanwhile, struggled at the start.

""After that first beer,"" he said, ""I was completely thrown off. I have no excuses.""

O'Mara, wearing an orange singlet and white tube socks, won the race in the chugging zone, quaffing her Budweiser Platinum with authority. Forty-three-year-old Austin resident Andrea Fisher, the 2014 second-place finisher, was credited with a second-place time of 6:26:29.

Less than an hour after the race, O'Mara told ESPN.com she was feeling ""drunk but mostly happy.""

""My gosh, this atmosphere was so much more competitive than Michigan,"" she said. ""I've picked up a lot of little tips, like walking through the transition area, that really helped me.""

DORAL, Fla. -- After an admittedly slow start to his year, Jason Day felt as though he needed a little advice last week. So he called an old friend -- Tiger Woods.

Editor's Picks Tiger: Chipping and putting, but no timetable On his website, Tiger Woods said he's chipping, putting and hitting 9-iron shots as part of his recovery, but he didn't offer a timetable on his return.

""He had nothing else, I guess,"" Day said with a laugh about Woods, who hasn't competed in more than six months after two additional back surgeries. ""He was just sitting at his home and I just called.""

Their conversation lasted about 50 minutes, according to Day, and Woods was steadfast in his advice to the world's No. 2 player.

""Every time that I talk to him, it's mindset, mental toughness, effort,"" Day said. ""It didn't matter how bad it was; if it was a course that he did not like, he was just going to flat out-execute you. It did not matter. That's that killer instinct that I need to get back like I had at the second half of last year, get back and take it into this year and go through with it.""

Last year, Day won five PGA Tour titles, including the PGA Championship, and four times in the final three months of the season.

Jason Day said he shares frequent text messages with Tiger Woods about ""mainly just golf,"" but admits that the 14-time major winner has to ""kind of dumb down"" any advice ""to my level."" Warren Little/Getty Images

""I have the killer instinct -- I do, it's down there, but it just hasn't come out yet [this year],"" he said. ""Once it does, I'm hoping that I can replicate the second half of last year. But it's amazing to be able to talk to someone that's done it for so long, because [Woods] did it for 14, 15 years of just absolutely dominating and killing it. If there's a better person to talk to about it, that was him.""

Day explained that last year's success, which lifted him to No. 1 in the world for four weeks, has led to greater expectations -- both internally and externally.

Dealing with those expectations was another reason for his phone call to Woods.

""That's one of the main reasons why I called Tiger was to ask him about stuff like that, because he dealt with it so great and he wanted it for so long, and that's the biggest key was want,"" he said. ""It really comes from within. But once again, I'm talking to Tiger about it and just I have to make sure that I go out there and go through the process right and do all the little things that got me to that point of dominating the second half.""

In three starts this year, Day has finishes of 10th place, 11th place and a missed cut at the Farmers Insurance Open.

(2:09)

DORAL, Fla. -- Adam Scott faced a daunting challenge, a six-shot deficit with 13 holes remaining on a course that was playing tougher than it had at any point this week.

And after overcoming that, he needed to survive two brushes with big trouble on the final hole to finish the job.

Scott won for the second straight week, shooting a final-round 69 to win the Cadillac Championship by one shot over Bubba Watson. It's the second win for Scott in a World Golf Championships event, his 13th career win on the PGA Tour and he now hasn't finished lower than second in any of his last three starts.

""Everything fell the right way for me today,"" Scott said.

Editor's Picks Lucky breaks fall Adam Scott's way in Doral victory Adam Scott isn't naive enough to think he deserved the fortuitous bounces that helped him win the WGC-Cadillac Championship. He does, however, realize that luck played a part.

Bowditch shoots 37 over, worst WGC score ever Steven Bowditch shot 84 on Sunday to finish the Cadillac Championship at Doral at 37 over, which is the highest score ever in a World Golf Championships event. 1 Related

Scott finished the week at 12-under 276. Watson (68) was alone in second, and Danny Willett (69) and Rory McIlroy (74) were tied for third, two shots back. Phil Mickelson (70) was alone in fifth at 9 under and Jimmy Walker shot the round of the day, a 6-under 66 to finish alone in sixth at 8 under.

With course owner Donald Trump popping in on Sunday, arriving by helicopter and greeting fans as he drove around in a cart, there was plenty of drama away from the fairways and greens.

Scott ensured there was a ton on the grass as well, after two double-bogeys in a three-hole span on the front side seemed to send his round into a tailspin. That is, until he got hot at just the right time with birdies on six of his next nine holes after the second double.

""It was such a challenge out there today,"" Scott said. ""I knew if I could just get a couple before the turn, maybe I'll have a chance.""

It's anyone's guess if Scott will get a chance to defend the title at Doral in 2017. General Motors' sponsorship agreement with the event ends this week and with no sponsor, there's no tournament.

""Our hope is that the future could allow us to stay here and continue to build the tournament,"" PGA Tour Commissioner Tim Finchem said Sunday afternoon, meeting with reporters before sitting down privately with Trump to talk about the tournament's future. ""But we'll have more to say about that after we do a full evaluation of our performance this year.""

Count Watson, who has finished second or third at Doral four times in the past five years, among those who want Doral to stay on the schedule, as it has been since 1962.

""If they move it I'll be sad,"" Watson said, ""because I'm pretty good around this place.""

That he is, but Scott -- despite walking a tightrope the last three holes -- was a bit better.

He saved par on the par-4 16th, after his drive went over the green and nestled in a bunker. His second shot was dreadful, finding a patch of greenside rough. From there he popped a chip 8 feet past the hole, then made the putt for par.

The trouble only got worse from there.

His tee ball on 17 found a bunker while Watson, on the green ahead, made birdie to get within one. Scott eventually saved par, headed to the final hole with that one-shot lead -- and put his tee shot in the right rough, a skinny palm tree impeding his path to the green. So he went left, around the tree but toward the water, and that shot somehow caught enough thick grass on a sharp slope to stop before getting wet.

""I was so lucky for it to stay up inside the hazard line,"" Scott said. ""When you're that lucky, you better get them up and down.""

That's exactly what he did. Scott chipped to 6 feet, made the par putt and moments later knew the win was his.

""I can't believe I've won back-to-back weeks,"" Scott said. ""To win a World Golf Championship is huge again.""

Watson made eagle at the par-5 8th to get into real contention Sunday, but his big mistake was a bogey on the par-4 14th. He couldn't get up-and-down from a greenside bunker, Scott made birdie on the same hole just a few minutes later, and that two-shot swing proved critical.

""I gave it a good effort,"" Watson said. ""What I'm working on in my head is working out. Right now, I've got the energy and the mind-set to play some decent golf, so very positive, very happy about the week and what took place.""

Divots: McIlroy, who came into the day with a three-shot lead, didn't make a birdie until the 16th hole. ""I didn't take advantage of the holes I should have,"" said McIlroy, who next plays at Bay Hill. ... Only seven of the 65 players avoided making at least one double-bogey this week.",[]

Para llegar a ello tuvo que pasar por rechazos y buscar alternativas, como un reality show, hasta convertirse en futbolista de la MLS.

Ahora milita en Santos Laguna y ha jugado los seis partidos de Liga que se han disputado hasta el momento. Jorge Villafana disfruta su momento.

No es facil, la carrera de un jugador es de estar arriba y abajo, pero siempre hay que pensar positivo y echarle todas las ganas, explico el futbolista mexicoamericano en entrevista con ESPN Digital. Para cumplir con su objetivo de ser futbolista profesional, en 2007 Villafana se inscribio al reality Sueno MLS y gracias a eso se gano un lugar en Chivas USA, club que le habia cerrado las puertas tiempo atras.

La forma de llegar a su meta fue la menos esperada. De hecho, acudio al concurso sin muchas expectativas y despues de que se lo insistieran sus familiares y amigos. Ahora todo eso es parte del recuerdo.

Mi carrera no ha sido nada facil, yo sali de un reality y al principio no creian en eso, se pensaba que a lo mejor solamente era por publicidad o algo, pero la verdad es que yo lo vi como una oportunidad, asi me mentalice. No ha sido facil, pero hasta ahorita aqui andamos jugando, recordo el jugador que en 2015 se convirtio en el primero en ganar el reality Sueno MLS que pudo levantar un titulo de dicha Liga.

Jorge, nacido en Anaheim en 1989, vivio sus primeros meses en Estados Unidos y luego llego a Mexico para pasar sus siguientes 15 anos. Radico en Penjamo, Guanajuato, y el futbol simplemente era parte de su vida.

Entre sus objetivos, cuando era joven, no figuraba la posibilidad de ser jugador profesional. Su mentalidad, sin embargo, cambio una vez que regreso a Estados Unidos y curso la preparatoria. Sus condiciones eran destacadas por sus companeros y entrenadores hasta que decidio probar suerte con Chivas USA, equipo que lo desecho en cuestion de tiempo.

Luego vino la posibilidad del reality Sueno MLS y vida cambio. Se da la oportunidad de que Chivas USA hace esto con la MLS y fui un poco desanimado, pero en los ultimos dias que habia de inscripcion, decido ir e hice todo el proceso y al final lo gane"".

En ese momento tenia 16 o 17 anos, estaba muy chico y la verdad no se en que mejore. Me acuerdo que quien estaba de visor fue quien me dijo que entrara e hiciera las pruebas. Hacia las cosas que me decian y les gustaba lo que hacia y a lo mejor les gusto mucho como para que me quedara, compartio.

El proceso en ganarse su puesto, firmar con Chivas USA, fue mas rapido de lo esperado. Las cosas se me dieron rapido, gane el concurse de sueno MLS y en un ano ya me dieron el contrato con Chivas USA. Fue un proceso rapido, en un ano estaba jugando en la MLS, indico.

Ya pasado eso, se gano su puesto en el 'rebano' angelino, club en el que milito ocho campanas. Sus actuaciones lo llevaron al combinado estadounidense Sub 20 con el que fue al Mundial de Egipto en 2009 y se quedo en el camino con la Sub 23 que quiso llegar a los Juegos Olimpicos de Londres 2012.

Para 2014 fue transferido al Portland Timbers, entidad en la que fue campeon el ano pasado. En 2016, su destino lo llevo a Mexico para jugar con Santos Laguna. En lo personal pienso que fue un ano (2015) muy bueno y al tener la doble nacionalidad, sabia de la posibilidad de venir al futbol mexicano. Se tuvo un buen torneo, llegamos a la Final y los clubes se van fijando mas en uno. Que haya sido un buen ano me ayudo a venir, considero el lateral, titular indiscutible de Santos.

Villafana sigue con suenos pendientes y objetivos por cumplir. Uno de sus mas cercanos es convertirse en campeon en Mexico y trabaja para ello. Al final, si algo le ha quedado claro es que las oportunidades estan para quien las busca y las trabaja. Algo que me ha servido mucho es no perder la confianza, ir a entrenar todos los dias, de mejorar cada dia, de siempre estar a tu nivel y mejorar, sostiene.",[]
espn.com,,The hyper-chaotic mystery of Longzhu Gaming,"['James Obscurica', 'James Bates', 'Alan Nahaz', 'Obscurica Chen', 'Stephen Chiu', 'Dan Szymborski', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Timothy Lee', 'Tyler Erzberger', 'Tyler Fionn']","Money brings the opportunity to create something great. In a growing esports scene that hasn't played around with words like salary cap just yet, seemingly unlimited funding gives you a massive advantage over your peers.

Incredible Miracle was given a chance to change its fate this offseason when its Chinese sponsor, Longzhu, took full control of the team and re-branded it as Longzhu Gaming. The owners and staff around the organization didn't hide their intentions in the offseason -- they wanted to build a team that could win the world championship Summoner's Cup, and they had the funds to do it. They were rumored to be in discussions with the likes of world champion Cho ""Mata"" Se-hyeong and former player turned superstar Song ""Smeb"" Kyung-ho, but failed to sign either.

In the end, the new ""Manchester City of League"" put together an all-star lineup that lived up to its offseason proclamations: Shin ""CoCo"" Jin-yeong at the middle lane position, arguably the second best player at his role in all of South Korea, behind only Lee ""Faker"" Sang-hyeok. Lee ""Chaser"" Sang-hyun, the ace of the Jin Air Green Wings in 2015, at the jungler position. Lee ""Flame"" Ho-jong, one of the all-time greats in the top lane, coming back to his homeland after spending a turbulent year in China. And Lee ""Fury"" Jin-yong, an overlooked star AD carry from the rebuilding Samsung Galaxy who might be the team's best pickup. Editor's Picks This isn't even their final form - SK Telecom and IEM Faker just accrued his eighth major championship under the SK Telecom T1 banner. Now his team heads back to South Korea, where they face an uphill battle to take another LCK title.

The two Korean geniuses of LoL The paths of South Korean LoL legends Lee ""Faker"" Sang-hyeok and Cho ""Mata"" Se-hyeong have been intertwined since each debuted, and they may face off again in the IEM Katowice finals. 1 Related

Expectations had never been higher for the franchise, which had lingered in the bottom rungs of the Korean standings for almost four years before the re-branding. Every time there was a tiny glimmer of hope that things were going to change for the organization, something would go terribly wrong and ruin the momentum. Incredible Miracle wasn't strong enough to compete with the best teams in South Korea, but also wasn't weak enough to fall out of the top leagues, forcing a blowup. It was a looping nightmare that began and ended with the squad's loyal fans patiently waiting for the day they could see their beloved team succeed.

So, one match past the halfway mark of the regular season, what would you expect Longzhu Gaming's record to be? 7-3? Maybe even 8-2 if things came together quickly? Nope, an even 5-5 record and sixth place in the LCK standings.

If the playoffs started today, all the resources that were given to the team in the offseason would be for naught, and the organization would have to look forward to the summer split.

The only thing consistent about LZ's play this campaign has been the inconsistency. It would be easier to figure out if Longzhu were simply a bad team -- but it's not. When Longzhu has played its best games of the season, it has appeared to be a world-class team: highly talented, coordinated and well-prepared for opponents. It hasn't been uncommon for LZ to steamroll through its opponents on occasion, picking up a small advantage in the early-game and snowballing that into to a 20-minute victory through a mix of superior raw talent and glimpses of synergy.

But miscommunication can sink Longzhu, especially in the early minutes. A player gets caught trying to invade the enemy jungle, the other team collapses and LZ isn't fast enough on the trigger to help. A dive occurs in the bottom lane seconds after Longzhu's top laner just teleported back to lane to farm, causing LZ to get outnumbered and picked apart in the bottom. Even if LZ gets into the late-game in one of its low-kill, grinder-type games, the players have shown tiny lapses of judgment at crucial times, dropping winnable sets.

A middling team usually lacks talent at one or more positions. In the case of Longzhu Gaming, it might be the opposite. LZ might just possess too much talent.

The 10 Dragons of Longzhu

Having substitutes is almost a necessity now for teams in the major regions of League of Legends. Last year, world champion SK Telecom T1 even routinely switched out Faker, its best player, in favor of the more defensive-oriented Lee ""Easyhoon"" Ji-hoon.

Longzhu plays with a 10-man roster. Through the first 10 matches of the season, LZ has utilized nine, with only support substitute Jang ""Zzus"" Joon-soo sitting. The player with the least amount of games after Zzus (and the suspended Fury) is Kim ""Frozen"" Tae-il in the mid lane, who has the highest KDA on the team, while also having one of the highest win rates.

 LCK !     .

Saying the 10 players on Longzhu are skilled would be an understatement. The team has a diverse collection of veterans, players in their prime and up-and-coming talent transitioning from the amateur scene. Nine of Longzhu's 10 dragons are in the top 100 of Korea's cutthroat Challenger ladder. The only player not to crack the ranks, AD carry Kang ""Cpt Jack"" Hyung-woo, is also the most experienced member.

The main issue with Longzhu for the first half of the season was the lack of stability. Although LZ treated the first nine matches of the split as a training period, the players were never able to find a starting five that clicked. Fury didn't help matters by being suspended then -- over a contract tampering issue -- and only returning in the match against the league-leading ROX Tigers that ended in a swift 0-2 loss.

Whenever one lineup had gotten the hang of playing together, LZ would switch things up. And rather than one of the starting fives pulling ahead of the others (or completely blowing up), they all seemed to do well enough to deserve another shot down the line.

Pillars of the top lane

If there is one role that Longzhu can feel comfortable with, it's the top lane.

It's been a battle between two of South Korea's all-time greatest at the role. Flame was the undisputed best during 2013 and early 2014, but has struggled with trying to find that peak form again, bouncing from Korea to China and now back to his home country. Gu ""Expession"" Bon-taek also was at the top of his game in 2013, playing on the NaJin Black Sword team that almost upset SK Telecom T1 in the championship semifinals.

Both longtime stars have had resurgent seasons, and they've repeatedly been the backbone of LZ's wins. Expession has performed better in the laning phase and shown a slightly deeper champion pool. Flame can take over games if he gets a small advantage early and can lean on his Gangplank, Fiora and Ryze performances.

Expession has been stoic and stable in his efforts. Flame has been explosive and consistently improving.

The same cannot be said for LZ's jungle.

Looking into a mirror

Lee ""Chaser"" Sang-hyun was known as the LCK's best carry jungler in 2015. His maverick style was supposed to be one of the cornerstones to LZ's success, but Chaser's play has been chaotic.

One game he looks like the ace player we expected, making smooth, decisive ganks in the early-game and getting a massive lead for his team. And in the very next game he can look like a deer in the headlights, trapped in the enemy jungle in the first two minutes, giving up first blood.

Just like his club, Chaser is gifted but erratic. He either plays like the best in the world or a solo queue jungler who doesn't work alongside his team.

And here's the issue: Unlike other positions where the players complement each other, LZ's junglers are like father and son. Lee ""Crash"" Dong-woo, the other jungler on the roster, should be called Chaser Jr. He's one of the best jungler prospects to come down the Korean pipeline in quite some time, and his raw talent is up there with the best players at the. He can take over games with his aggressive style of invading.

But exactly like Chaser, Crash sometimes put his brawn in front of his brain. He'll pick up a triple kill with a phenomenal converge in the top lane and then needlessly die 30 seconds later trying to grab the enemy's red buff. Crash is the epitome of a player that tries to do too much. Instead of picking up a few kills, recalling and surveying the situation before making his next strike on the map, he'll dive headfirst into the enemy side of the map without any vision and only sheer brash confidence on his side.

Given Crash's overzealous tendencies, Chaser should be the player that LZ sticks with as the starter for at least the spring season -- but Crash is a rookie in the LCK. His mistakes are expected of an amateur player getting his first taste in the pro ranks. If Chaser doesn't fix his issues, his younger self might fly right past him come the summer season.

Lee ""Flame"" Ho-jong returned home with Longzhu after a turbulent year in China. Riot Games

Offense and defense

Longzhu's mid lane and AD carry positions are a classic example of offense vs. defense.

LZ has Coco at mid and Fury at AD carry, two players who can single-handedly win games with attacking prowess. Then there's Frozen and CptJack, who run the defensive, safe play you need until the teamfighting phase.

With the suspension, Fury hasn't had the chance to play much this split. He's been constantly playing online in Korea's solo queue, hovering around the top three spots for the past month. The lone bright spot on a rebuilding Samsung team last year, Fury is the type of player who could become one of the biggest stars in the league with the right team around him.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, CptJack is everything Fury isn't. His laning phase isn't great, but he makes up for it with his shot calling, leadership and teamfighting. Jack's knack for keeping cool under pressure and knowing how to convert chances has made him a starter on CJ Entus, Jin Air and now Longzhu. On a team with the likes of Flame, Chaser and Coco, Jack's utility-style and safe laning might be what's best for the team in the long run. The mid lane rivalry is one of the few positions about which LZ has some certainty. Frozen has played only six games and Coco was considered by many to be the second best mid laner behind Faker in 2015.

The starters conundrum

Now, the big question: Who should play in Longzhu's starting five?

LZ played the combination of Expession, Chaser, Coco, Fury and Pure in its first second-round match against the ROX Tigers, but put up one of its worst team performances of the season. Maybe Longzhu shouldn't be too hasty and shake things up since the Tigers are undefeated and likely the best team in the world.

We've seen lineups with almost every player on the roster look absolutely dominant in one game and then clueless in the next. For all the mixing and matching LZ Gaming has done, it seems like the organization is getting further away from a solution. The addition of Fury only adds another element to this ongoing mystery.

ROX Tigers is an action movie, always getting into fights and playing in fast-paced contests. Defending champ SK Telecom T1 is a drama, attempting to regain its former glory following the departure of captain in the offseason. CJ Entus is a thriller, with a 17-year-old amateur prodigy (Gwak ""Bdd"" Bo-seong) trying to help the former kings of Korea make the postseason.

Longzhu, well, Longzhu is a mystery -- a woeful, re-branded organization infused with foreign money and big signings trying to make the club a world championship contender. But even after all that, LZ is still struggling to make the playoffs.

Ten players. Five starting spots. If Longzhu Gaming want to get its money's worth, it's up to the organization to solve the riddle of which players are best suited to lead LZ into the future.",[]

The New York City Marathon is the largest in the world, and one of the biggest sporting events every year in the United States. Running is a part of the fabric of the city, and there are plenty of reasons New Yorkers and others push themselves to cover 26.2 miles through all five boroughs.

Here, five New Yorkers tell the stories of how they came to love running, how its healing power helped them overcome obstacles and heartache, and what motivates them to keep going.

Sam, former smoker

Seth Ricart

""I've been on my own since I was 16. My parents were in a religious cult. We were always on the move. My dad has lived in 27 different homes since I've been alive. ""

""I started smoking when I was 21. Alcohol and cigarettes were crutches that allowed me to open up socially. [They] were a big part of the crowd I hung with and the people I wanted to be accepted by.""

""I moved to New York in 2006. I wanted to live in the most challenging place I could find. The first six or seven times I attempted to quit I tried the patch, nicotine gum, even hypnotism -- which worked for a month.""

""I realized I needed something healthy, something more in my essence. That's when I started running seriously.""

""The thought of running a marathon used to be absolutely ludicrous to me. I'm not married. I've never had a kid. I didn't graduate from high school. But a lot changes when you give up a habit like cigarettes. You feel like you can do anything.""

Felipe, Mexican immigrant

Seth Ricart

""I was born and raised in a small state in Mexico and herded cattle with my father. I think a lot of my strength and endurance comes from growing up in the mountains.""

""I crossed the U.S.-Mexico border twice. The first time was easy. The second time ... I was robbed and held for a month. It took two more attempts before I was able to successfully cross.

""I never felt the need to stop. My desire to continue was always because of my children. Family is most important to me. I knew how much I needed to provide for them. It's how I express my love.""

Seth Ricart

""I've lived in New York City for 15 years. I came here for economic reasons. I have two girls and two boys back home. I speak to my children every day. The affection has never gone away. ""

""I was excited to run when I first came to New York. Running is different here. You can run at night and see the city lights. You can't do that in Mexico. Running is my addiction. I run about 100 miles a week. I can feel bad, sad or tired from work; running is a way of balancing me.""

""I always have people around me, but running makes me feel better that I'm not with my family. I can sit and think about how much I miss my family, but instead I choose to run. I've been running for 25 years. My goal is to continue to run until I die.""

Blue, grieving son

Seth Ricart

""I'm African-American and Cherokee Indian. My mom's an architect; my dad was an orthodontist. He came from nothing and bettered his life through sports. My dad was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2000. He passed away on July 7, 2007.""

""Everything fell apart after he died. He was a big part of my life, and I felt like I had no one. I lost it. I had the deepest plunge into depression for a year. I felt like giving up. While I dealt with my dad's estate, my girlfriend and I broke up.""

Seth Ricart

""I felt an aggressive anger about the loss of my dad and the breakup. It was maddening. I wanted to hit something. I was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. I went to a therapist for several months. But the real therapy came when I started to run.""

""I ran as fast as I could and exhausted myself completely. The pain I felt inside made me run faster, and sometimes I'd cry. I felt like a man on fire, like I was running through a burning building and needed to get out. And when I was done with a run, I relaxed.""

""Running really shook me up, like getting slapped in the face. It opened me up to different people, things and relationships. I never expected that to happen. ""

Amira, mother of two

Seth Ricart

""I got pregnant in 2005. I was 26 at the time, living in New York. I felt ready to have a baby. One day I was lying down during yoga, and I didn't feel the baby moving. I went to my OB-GYN. My doctor didn't see a heartbeat. I felt emptiness, like I was going to die.""

""I felt angry, sad and shocked. You feel like it's a personal thing when your body fails you. I felt like I let down my husband and my family.""

""I got pregnant four months later. I delivered my son at 35 weeks. I was a very anxious parent then, and also after my second son was born. After things started to settle down, I realized I needed something for myself. I started to run again.""

""The best hour of my day was when I ran, often in Central Park. Running helped me feel strong, like my body wasn't letting me down and that I could achieve things. I feel at peace now, 10 years later. Running helped me find that peace. I'll always run. And hopefully my kids will come with me once in a while.""

Robin, running coach/cycling instructor/ultramarathoner

Seth Ricart

""I was 20 years old and in my senior year at NYU. One Friday night, I was in a restaurant when a man walked in and said he'd been shot. In an instant, the perpetrator grabbed my hair and dragged me.""

""I thought it was a robbery and that he'd take our money and go. But he threw down garbage bags and made me tie people. Then he sprayed kerosene and flicked a lighter. Then he held a gun to one side of my temple and a lighter to the other. He used me as a shield against the NYPD stationed outside.""

""A woman jumped him from behind. The police shot him -- the bullet grazed his temple -- and rushed in.""

""It wasn't until I started running that I began to process everything and carve out this white noise. I'm nostalgic for that time, because running was never as simple or powerful for me as it was then. I had so much stress and tension to run out.""

""Now, after all this time, I have peace. I'm a running coach, cycling instructor and ultramarathoner. I've run 17 marathons to date. One time, I ran five marathons in five days across Utah. I'm fueled by the ethos that there is no finish line.""

""What's the deeper reason that actually keeps me running? It's that cathartic feeling of growth. I like paying that message forward.""",[]

espn.com,,Maria Sharapova to face toughest setback of career,"['Niall Seewang', 'Greg Garber', 'Mark Hodgkinson', 'Nic Atkin', 'Peter Bodo', 'Pa Sport', 'Espn Com', 'Espn Staff', 'Jim Caple']","LOS ANGELES -- Journalists from news sites around the world gathered in a ballroom of The L.A. Hotel Downtown on Monday, anxiously awaiting a news conference with one of the biggest names in women's sports. After Maria Sharapova announced she was going to make a major announcement Monday, there was considerable speculation that the tennis legend was going to retire from the sport. Many in the room prepared stories and tweets to reveal just that as soon as she confirmed the news.

Instead, Sharapova, dressed in all black, took the podium and revealed she tested positive for the newly banned performance-enhancing drug meldonium at the Australian Open. Contrary to what many assumed going into Monday's news conference, when (and whether) she returns to the court will not be her decision but that of the International Tennis Federation.

At 28, Maria Sharapova could be facing a long suspension from tennis. Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images

""I made a huge mistake,"" Sharapova said of taking the drug that had been banned as of Jan. 1. ""I have let my fans down, and let the sport down that I have been playing since the age of 4 that I love so deeply.""

What will her punishment be and how long a suspension does she face? Her lawyer, John Haggerty, said intentional PED use can be a four-year ban and unintentional use can be two years. Haggerty says that with mitigating circumstances -- and he believes there are many in Sharapova's case -- it can be much less.

""I know with this that I face consequences,"" Sharapova said. ""I don't want to end my career this way, and I really hope I'm given another chance to play this game.""

The failed test comes at an already challenging time in Sharapova's career. While she is still 28 -- how can she still be so young? -- injuries have repeatedly interrupted her performance. She has played in only three events the past eight months and had already said earlier she was going to sit out this week's tournament at Indian Wells with a forearm injury. Forearm, leg, elbow, shoulder, whatever -- she has been dealing with a lot of body issues. Those are big reasons her ranking has already been slipping (and will continue).

Sharapova's resiliency and determination on the court are well-known. Yet she also clearly has struggled with the pressure of losing repeatedly to Serena, who has beaten her every match they have played since 2005. After Maria finds out when she can return, will she bounce back as she often has in the third set of matches against other opponents? Or will she let this stick in her mind like the Serena losses and add to her woes on the court?

Editor's Picks Sharapova flunked drug test at Aussie Open Maria Sharapova announced that she failed a drug test at the Australian Open, but she does not yet know her penalty.

Ford: Sharapova's admission brings doping issue to forefront Maria Sharapova's admission to a failed drug test again highlights the debate of doping and sport, and it casts a bigger spotlight on the issue in tennis.

Tennis community reacts to Sharapova's failed drug test Needless to say, fellow players and analysts were stunned by the news of Maria Sharapova testing positive for a banned substance. 2 Related

It also will be interesting to see how this affects her endorsement deals. Sharapova is the Roger Federer of women's tennis, with Forbes reporting that she earn $23 million through sponsorship deals last year alone. Positive drug tests rarely help in that area. Look what happened to Alex Rodriguez. Which is why PED use by one of the most famous and popular players is more bad news for the sport of tennis, which already had been dealing with the match-fixing allegations that broke during the Australian Open.

When we last saw Sharapova in January, she was walking dejectedly off the court at Rod Laver Arena. It was the quarterfinals at the Australian Open, and she had been handed yet another humbling loss by Serena.

It was her 18th consecutive loss to her nemesis. But after Monday's announcement, and the ensuing fallout from it, Sharapova now faces an even tougher challenge to her career now than she ever did against Serena.",[]
espn.com,,LeBron James reflects on NBA debut before last game at Arco Arena,"['Dave Mcmenamin', 'Mike Mazzeo']","SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- When LeBron James thinks back to his first NBA game some 13 years ago, he remembers specific sequences. He remembers the teammates he played alongside. He even remembers his stat line, nearly to a T.

I had less tattoos and more hair, James said prior to Cleveland Cavaliers shootaround Wednesday in preparation for the game against the Sacramento Kings that night. And my jersey was a lot bigger at that time, I had less weight. But for the most part its been a great run so far in my career.

With the Cavs set to play their last game at Sleep Train Arena, formerly Arco Arena, before the Kings move to the brand new Golden 1 Center in the fall, James reflected on Oct. 29, 2003 -- the night he made his league debut in Sacramento.

Set to play his final game in Sacramento's Sleep Train Arena, LeBron James thought back to his NBA debut -- when he scored 25 points against the Kings in what was then called Arco Arena. Rocky Widner/NBAE/Getty Images

It was great, James said. Obviously the fans, they came out for that game for two reasons. They wanted to see if I was worthy of what everybody was talking about, but also they had a great team at the time, still. That team was winning a lot of ball games at that time, still, and they had an opportunity to have a great run, so it was just great to be a part of the atmosphere. It was my first time in the NBA and then to be able to be a part of an atmosphere like this, it was pretty cool.

A look at the box score from that night shows just how much has changed. Of the 18 players to get in the game that night, only James is still playing. The others have gone on to a variety of pursuits. For instance, Kevin Ollie is the head coach of the University of Connecticut mens basketball team, no longer a backup point guard on the Cavs' bench. Vlade Divac is now the Kings general manager rather than their starting center. Peja Stojakovic is their director of player personnel and development, instead of their sharp-shooting wing.

The Cavs lost 106-92 that night but James put up 25 points, nine assists, six rebounds and four steals (when he rattled off his stats from memory on Wednesday, he shorted himself a rebound). The iconic image from the game remains him soaring through the air, ball cocked way behind his head, ready to throw down a right-handed breakaway dunk. However, James said he remembers another play more.

I made my first shot, he said. It was a fadeaway baseline jumper right over there by our bench. That was probably the toughest shot I took all that night, besides my left-hand finger roll on the break, I think in the second [quarter]. Usually you try to get like a layup or a dunk, I made a jumper and that just kind of settled me down. To get a fast-break dunk in that game, we were kind of making a run, we were making a run to get back into the game at the time, it settled me in.

James actually followed that dunk with another steal, but rather than add to his highlight reel, dished it off to Ricky Davis.

It was just my unselfish ways, James said. I had already gotten my fast-break dunk and our scorer at the time was Ricky, so, you know, lets try to get him in a rhythm.

The 31-year-old James, with some gray in his beard and wearing a baseball cap with a curved rim (colloquially known as a dad hat), said he has gone back to watch the tape of that game a couple of times in the past decade-plus.

Just seeing how for an 18-year-old kid there really wasnt much I could tell him at that point, James said of himself. He was just excited to be on the court, and he was just having fun. This was before social media and all that [sort of thing], so he didnt really have to worry about anything, just go out and play and live with the results, live with whatever happened, and hes continued to do that.

James said he already got a glimpse of the Golden 1 Center construction on his way to shootaround from the team hotel on Wednesday morning. Hell be sure to take one last look at his surroundings Wednesday night.

Its impossible for it not to happen, knowing that well be playing in another arena next year when I come here and play, James said. Like I said, this building means a lot to my career. When I -- I dont know if its a movie made of me or my book gets [written about] my NBA career getting started, this will be the first place it starts, here at Sleep Train ... or Arco Arena. This will always be the beginning of it.",[]

(0:44)

The Miami Dolphins have officially completed a blockbuster trade Wednesday with the Philadelphia Eagles to acquire cornerback Byron Maxwell, linebacker Kiko Alonso and the No. 13 overall pick in the NFL draft. In exchange, the Dolphins sent Philadelphia the No. 8 overall pick.

Both sides have worked several days on this trade, and it wasn't without a couple of hiccups. On Wednesday, ESPN's Ed Werder reported Maxwell had a shoulder injury that was concerning to the Dolphins and threatened to nix the deal. However, Maxwell passed the physical and the trade proceeded.

Editor's Picks Maxwell trade shakes up first-round draft order An updated look at the NFL draft's first round following a trade between the Philadelphia Eagles and Miami Dolphins.

Maxwell has five years left on the $63 million contract he signed last year. He will make $8.5 million this season. Alonso is playing in the final year of his rookie contract and will make $991,948.

The Dolphins were ranked 25th in total defense last season and are in the process of doing a makeover. They also signed defensive end Mario Williams to a two-year contract and a source told ESPN's Adam Caplan that the team agreed to terms with Detroit safety Isa Abdul-Quddus.

Known as a hard hitter, Abdul-Quddus, 26, has played in 74 NFL games, making 136 tackles with four forced fumbles, two interceptions, a sack and a fumble recovery.

To make room for the moves, the Dolphins also released veteran cornerback Brent Grimes, who made the Pro Bowl in his past three seasons with Miami. He was scheduled to make $8 million in 2016 and is now an unrestricted free agent.

Grimes had a successful three-year tenure in Miami. He signed with the team in 2013 and had 13 interceptions total in that span. Grimes recorded 49 tackles and four interceptions last season.

While Grimes was a Pro Bowl selection on the field, his wife, Miko, made headlines off it.

Miko Grimes, who hosts a Miami radio show, has publicly criticized Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill, used Twitter to rant about things including her husband not winning MVP honors at the Pro Bowl, his alleged mistreatment by the Atlanta Falcons, what she sees as the NFL's greed and sexism, and her unhappiness with the New England Patriots for parting company with Vince Wilfork.

She was also arrested on charges of battery on a police officer, resisting arrest and disorderly conduct outside of Sun Life Stadium before a Bills-Dolphins game last season. The charges were later dropped.

Bruce Irvin, one of most intriguing free agents, is expected to sign with the Oakland Raiders when the new league year starts on Wednesday at 4 p.m. ET, filling their need for an edge rush presence opposite All-Pro defender Khalil Mack.

Irvin was one of the surprises of the 2012 draft, as the Seattle Seahawks nabbed him No. 15 overall without much fanfare. The undersized rusher stepped right into a situational role for the Seahawks, picking up 11 sacks, 12 quarterback hits and 24 hurries on 393 rushes as a rookie in 2012, per Pro Football Focus grading. In 2013, however, his role changed, and he had a dip in production. The Seahawks moved Irvin out to more of a traditional Sam linebacker, charged with setting the edge in the running game and dropping into coverage more often; he had 191 coverage snaps in 2013, compared to only 14 in 2012.",[]
espn.com,,Football fans support changes in gambling laws,"['Steve Fainaru', 'Paula Lavigne', 'Darren Rovell', 'Ben Fawkes', 'David Purdum']","While the NFL remains opposed to legalizing sports betting across the United States, football fans overwhelmingly believe it's time for a change.

Research released Wednesday by the American Gaming Association found that 80 percent of people polled who said they expect to watch Super Bowl 50 want to change the current sports betting laws in the U.S., and 66 percent believe states should have the choice of whether to offer sports betting.

Billions of dollars will be wagered on Super Bowl 50, the vast majority of it illegally. Ezra Shaw/Getty Images

The research, conducted by The Mellman Group, consisted of 800 interviews completed in late January. Sixty-five percent of respondents believe transparent, regulated sports betting will either strengthen the integrity of games or have no impact on game outcomes. Seventy-two percent believe allowing states to regulate sports betting will make it safer for consumers.

""America's passion for football is rivaled only by its enthusiasm for sports betting,"" AGA president and CEO Geoff Freeman said in a statement coinciding with the release of the research. ""Fans believe regulated sports betting enhances the game experience, deepens their engagement with their favorite athletes and teams and protects the integrity of games.""

For decades, the NFL and other major professional sports leagues have opposed sports betting, fearing that it might damage the integrity of the games. The NBA, led by commissioner Adam Silver, changed its stance in 2014 and now supports legalization. Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred has said the topic needs ""fresh consideration,"" and the NHL is considering putting a franchise in Las Vegas, home base for legal sports betting in the U.S. But for now, thanks to a 24-year-old federal law, betting on sports remains illegal in the vast majority of states.

The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (PASPA) prohibits state-sponsored sports gambling in all but a handful of states. Nevada is the only state allowed to offer betting on single games. But PASPA has done very little to curtail the amount of money being wagered on sports in the U.S.

The AGA estimates that $4.2 billion will be wagered on Super Bowl 50 between the Denver Broncos and Carolina Panthers. Only 3 percent of the money will be wagered legally, according to the AGA, with most of betting action taking place with offshore sportsbooks and local bookmakers operating illegally.

New Jersey has been battling the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB and the NCAA to bring legalized sports betting to the Garden State for more than three years. The two sides will meet in the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Feb. 17 in a hearing that could shape the future of sports betting in the U.S.",[]
espn.com,,San Diego Chargers reach deal with nose tackle Brandon Mebane,"['Vaughn Mcclure', 'Ben Goessling', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Eric Williams', 'Josh Weinfuss', 'Jim Trotter', 'David Newton', 'Eric D', 'Mike Reiss', 'Paul Gutierrez']","SAN DIEGO -- The Chargers have been searching for a true nose tackle since Jamal Williams last played for team in 2009.

And the Chargers appear to have found their man in former Seattle Seahawks defensive tackle Brandon Mebane, signing him to a three-year deal at the start of free agency on Wednesday.

The Chargers also agreed to a three-year deal with former Indianapolis Colts safety Dwight Lowery, tendered safety Jahleel Addae (second round, $2. 553 million), along with tendering exclusive rights free agents receiver Dontrelle Inman and offensive lineman Kenny Wiggins.

The Chargers also added to their offense on Wednesday with the signing of wide receiver Travis Benjamin and re-signing of tight end Antonio Gates.

A Los Angeles native, Mebane was one of the main reasons Seattle has had one of the best run defenses in the NFL over the past five seasons.

And that's an area the Chargers needed to improve. San Diego gave up 4.8 yards per carry last season, third-worst in the NFL. The Chargers also allowed a league-worst 21 runs of 20-plus yards.

Mebane's impact shows up more on film than it does on the stat sheet. Coaches and teammates raved about Mebane's performance against the run last year, as the Seahawks held opponents to 3.6 yards per carry (third best in the NFL).

Originally a third-round pick in 2007, Mebane (6-foot-1, 311 pounds) spent nine seasons with the Seahawks. He is a two-down nose tackle who played 49.1 percent of the team's snaps last year.

Mebane, 31, won't generate much of a pass rush, but he can still hold up at the point of attack in the run game.

Lowery was signed by the Colts later in the free-agency period in 2015 and was an immediate starter at safety.

Lowery, 30, started all 16 games last season, registering 76 tackles, four interceptions and eight passes defended.

His best game was in Week 3, when he intercepted Tennessee rookie quarterback Marcus Mariota twice, including one that he returned for a touchdown, in the Colts' victory.

espn.com,,Questions still linger after U.S. women's national basketball team camp,['Mechelle Voepel'],"STORRS, Conn. -- They sort of scattered to the wind after three precious days together. Several of the world's best women's basketball players gathered at what had been a college home for some of them -- UConn -- for a USA Basketball national team training camp that ended Tuesday.

Some headed back to their overseas teams, while others remained in the United States to prepare for the WNBA season, which starts May 14.

The camp was essentially equal parts a refresher and bonding experience, where everyone has the same goal: to make the 2016 Olympic team, coached by UConn's Geno Auriemma. Of the 16 players who were in attendance, seven were on the 2012 Olympic team and nine were on the 2014 world championship team.

Editor's Picks UConn's Stewart savors 'break' to focus on USA camp There's no question Breanna Stewart is good enough to be on the U.S. Olympic team in Rio. But can the UConn senior snag one of just 12 roster spots? She certainly made her case this week.

Delle Donne appreciates Banham's game Is it great to have a green light as a shooter? What's the pressure like when shouldering the scoring load? Elena Delle Donne knows what Minnesota's high scorer, Rachel Banham, is going through.

Taurasi ready to return to top of her game After taking last WNBA season off to refresh and get stronger, Diana Taurasi wants to show in 2016, both in the WNBA and at the Rio Games, that she's still at the peak of her profession. 2 Related

""You see how hard these guys play and compete, how they want to look really good in front of their peers,"" Auriemma said. ""It's really nice to be around that. If you came here these three days and you make the team, you saw why. And if you don't make the team, you saw why. The kids who don't make the team but use the experience the right way, they're going to be on the team down the road.""

If there is one overriding question about the national team -- which actually has been lingering for several years now -- it's who is the heir at point guard to Seattle's Sue Bird and Minnesota's Lindsay Whalen. Whether that player actually will be going to the 2016 Olympics is anything but assured.

However, that person or persons was likely either at UConn's practice facility the past few days or would have been if not for injury and/or overseas commitments. Notice we said at the facility, not in the camp, because one has to assume UConn senior Moriah Jefferson will be in the mix for the 2018 world championship and 2020 Olympics.

But she isn't among the 25 finalists for the 2016 Olympics and thus couldn't take part in the training camp. However, with the event right in her own practice gym, she and other Huskies stopped by to watch. Jefferson, in fact, studied the workouts intently when she was there, looking a lot like a kid who had to stay in at recess while others got to go outside.

Jefferson's play with other USA Basketball teams, her UConn success, and the improvements she'll make in her imminent professional career would indicate she has a national team future ahead.

Brittney Griner said she had a subpar first day at camp, but, ""My second day was better, and [Tuesday] I was better. ... I'm a pretty confident player, so I think I did pretty good."" Jennifer Pottheiser/NBAE/Getty Images

Right now, though, it would seem Bird, Whalen and Diana Taurasi -- who's adept at running point for any team she's on, along with being a 2-guard -- are favorites to go to Rio de Janeiro. What's interesting, though, is how all three of the veterans still approached this like they had to prove themselves.

""Everyone wants to come out here and show what they can do,"" said Bird, who like Taurasi has gold medals from the 2004, '08, and '12 Olympics.

Bird turned 35 last October, but she recently re-signed with the Storm and has given herself time off from playing this winter.

""Sue looks good; this is the best I've seen her look in a long time,"" Taurasi said. ""Talk about someone who has that vicious cycle of year-round basketball taking a toll on you.

""But she's feeling healthy, and her main goal [in the WNBA] is to get Seattle back on the map. I think she looks great right now. And if there's one person who takes care of themselves, it's Sue.""

""From the last camp to this camp, Kayla McBride and Jewell Loyd really have taken that next step. ... I feel like their next couple of years, you're going to see special things from those two."" Diana Taurasi

Whalen, who will be 34 in May, was hobbled during the latter part of the WNBA season and the playoffs with bursitis in her ankle and a strained Achilles tendon. Even so, she still made some big plays for the Lynx in the run to their third WNBA championship. But she knew she had to get some rest over the winter months to be ready for a busy 2016.

""I took a good month off from training after the WNBA season, which I had not done in a long time,"" Whalen said. ""Then I got to spend extended time home for Christmas, and taking part in some family things. And that was really fun. Then I started getting ready for this camp.

""That gave me a nice window of rest and something to prepare for. I feel really good, now, mentally and physically on the basketball court. A little soreness here and there, but I'm sure everybody would say that. I'm enjoying it.""

Taurasi, who will be 34 in June, thinks that the future of the guard spot for USA Basketball is coming into better focus.

""I would say everyone played well,"" Taurasi said of this gathering. ""But from the last camp to this camp, Kayla McBride and Jewell Loyd really have taken that next step, I feel like, in their careers. They've gone overseas, they're starting to be very sure of their games, and I feel like their next couple of years, you're going to see special things from those two.

""With Sue, myself and Whalen, we've tried to do the best we can to make sure these kids are ready when it's their turn. With Kayla, Jewell and [Skylar] Diggins when she gets healthy, you're talking about three players who can do a lot.""

Like Sue Bird, Diana Taurasi has won Olympic gold medals in 2004, '08 and '12. Jennifer Pottheiser/NBAE/Getty Images

Diggins, who suffered a torn ACL last June, was not at the camp but is expected back for this WNBA season with the team relocated to Dallas, now called the Wings. San Antonio's Danielle Robinson and Chicago's Courtney Vandersloot were at the camp. And guards Briann January of Indiana and Odyssey Sims of Dallas were among the 25 finalists who weren't able to attend camp.

Three former Olympians in the post who are all likely to make the team again, if healthy, weren't able to attend the camp: Los Angeles' Candace Parker, New York's Tina Charles and Minnesota's Sylvia Fowles.

Phoenix center Brittney Griner, who played in the 2014 world championship, was at camp and was asked to assess her performance.

""My first day wasn't good. My second day was better, and [Tuesday] I was better,"" Griner said. ""I wish I could redo that first day. But I'm a pretty confident player, so I think I did pretty good.

""Like I've said before, I wouldn't want to be on the committee that has to pick the players. Because you could make a great argument for any player that doesn't make it, why they should be on the team.""

Last year's WNBA MVP, Chicago's Elena Delle Donne, is trying to make the national team for the first time, and she said she was focused on just filling in whatever role she was asked to play.

Minnesota's Maya Moore, the 2014 MVP and a past Olympian, said that one of the best things about participating with the national team is how it takes you back to the basics of what makes teams and players successful.

""I think it's refreshing, because it's challenge to get to do other things,"" Moore said. ""Here, I get to screen for somebody. I get to come to the high post and flash and be a facilitator. There are different things you get to focus on and work on, that maybe you don't do as much, especially overseas.""

Ultimately, there are always several very good players who are cut from the U.S. national team. With a run of five consecutive gold medals, this is a program that has overcome the challenges of limited time together by being able to assemble a team of superstars who truly play as a team. They've done that remarkably well, and that's the message that is reiterated at camps like this.

""I think it just provides more clarity and a reminder of the expectations of what Coach Auriemma requires,"" Moore said. ""And what this culture requires: excellence, attention to details, being unselfish, being tough and competitive all at the same time.""",[]

(1:08)

LOS ANGELES -- Michael Phelps' day began before sunrise at a Baltimore hotel. There was practice in the pool where his Olympic dreams first began. A corporate event at Under Armour's global headquarters to launch a new ad campaign. And then a 5 1/2-hour cross-country flight to L.A. for a news conference to discuss his preparation for the Rio Games.

In the past, such interviews and corporate events would have built around the idea of perfection. Michael Phelps was an athlete unlike anything we had ever seen. In the water, he could do no wrong. Out of it, the public knew very little and Phelps preferred to keep it that way.

His interviews were often short, impersonal and rarely wavered from swimming. But in this final act the Phelps narrative has evolved. He has had no choice. And perhaps at no time was that more apparent than on Tuesday, in a pair of PR-driven events on opposite sides of the country.

In the morning in Baltimore, Phelps' hometown, he watched as Under Armour revealed a 90-second ad. In the commercial, there are gritty images of Phelps swimming, sleeping, climbing into a cold tub and kicking his feet above his face in dryland workouts. It's all set to the somber, introspective ""Last Goodbye"" by The Kills. There are lyrics like ""I have no regrets ... for the past is behind me."" There is no dialogue in the ad. Just the music. And Phelps training. Pushing. Thinking. The ad is emotional, reflective. When Phelps saw the ad for the first time, it brought him and fiance Nicole Johnson to tears.

After the debut of the ad, Keenan Robinson, Phelps' trainer, put him through a 20-minute workout that typically takes twice as long. There was a staged Q&A with an Under Armour executive followed by interviews with more than 100 media from around the world. From there, Phelps' hopped onto a private jet, and after a cross-country flight stepped on the floor of UCLA's Pauley Pavilion where more journalists waited for a 34-minute Q&A as part of the U.S. Olympic Media Summit. It was Phelps' first appearance at the summit without his coach Bob Bowman by his side.

Phelps' whirlwind day began before dawn on the East Coast and ended with a news conference Tuesday evening in L.A., where he was unusually candid about life out of the pool. Laurin Wolf/Under Armour

Below the retired jerseys of sports legends such as Bill Walton, Kareem and Reggie Miller, Phelps was an open book. He confessed how little he had trained before the London games in 2012. ""I wanted nothing to do with the sport,"" he said. ""I was finished. Ready to move on and retire. I didn't want to train anymore.""

He discussed how much better he feels after not consuming an alcoholic drink since his second DUI arrest in September 2014. ""I see a complete change in my body,"" he said. ""I have a completely clear head. I don't have a headache, which is awesome. I'm actually happy every day. I'm able to be productive every day.""

And in one of the most impersonal settings imaginable, he admitted how critical it had been in his recovery from alcohol addiction (Phelps spent 45 days in an inpatient facility in Arizona following his September 2014 DUI arrest) to repair his complicated relationship with his father, who divorced his mother when he was a child. ""For me being able to have a relationship with my father somewhat is amazing,"" he said. ""It's something I always wanted as a kid and never did have. Now we are able to communicate and we talk almost weekly.""

There was little talk of actual swimming.

One question in the session dealt with what events Phelps planned to swim at Olympic Trials in June, but Phelps, who has never talked about an event schedule, brushed the question aside. He was open and revealing about everything else. When asked Tuesday night whether his medals from London meant anything less to him given the lack of effort he put toward them, Phelps insisted it made no difference. He appreciated all his medals the same. And then his eyes watered as he told the story of looking at his medals for the first time in several years when he and Johnson moved to Arizona last fall.

""I could remember back to every thought I had on the medal stand after each of those races,"" Phelps said. ""Every little tiny thing. And that was the first time I had ever done that and those things had ever sunk in. And it felt pretty cool. For the first time I was able to look back on my career and be excited and proud of what I did. I had never had the chance to do that before.""

For those who haven't spent time with Phelps over the past year, the candor might have seemed like a surprise. Or maybe even a bit of spin -- another stop on the Michael Phelps character redemption tour where there are millions of dollars at stake. You could almost see USOC officials shudder on Tuesday each time Phelps spoke of Under Armour, a rival of Nike, which is a main USOC sponsor. But even the largest of skeptics couldn't help but sense that perhaps Phelps needs these public therapy sessions as much as the reporters need their quotes.

Speaking about his struggles is perhaps another step in Phelps' recovery, another shackle from which he can break free and continue to feel more comfortable in his own skin. There are no more secrets. In interviews throughout the day, Phelps repeated a line that he has said often since he first returned to competition after his DUI arrest last April: He wants people to know the real Michael Phelps.

""I want to show people who I am,"" he says. ""They've seen me as just a swimmer. And to be quite honest, whatever opinion you have of me, that's fine. I am who I am and I'm not sugarcoating anything.""

There is no such thing as perfection. Like everyone else in the world, Phelps is flawed. He's complicated. He exists in the gray area where the rest of us all do as well. Now 30, soon to be married and a father, he has grown up and matured. And there's surely a sense of freedom in no longer living a double life.

""Just living a freer, happier life is a huge change,"" he said. ""I don't feel like I'm carrying weights around anymore. I pick up the phone when somebody calls. I used to dodge phone calls.

""The process I went through was difficult and challenging. People ask me if I could change anything in my life would I, and I wouldn't. Everything happens for a reason and I'm thankful I'm sitting here alive today and able to grow from the experiences I've had.""",[]
espn.com,,Shawn Porter keeps March 12 date to fight Lanardo Tyner in 12-round exhibition,"['Dan Rafael', 'Pa Sport', 'Brian Campbell', 'Nigel Collins']","Former welterweight titleholder Shawn Porter has not fought since his upset decision win over Adrien Broner in June and was going to have been out of the ring for nine months when he was scheduled to fight challenger titleholder Keith Thurman on March 12 in one of boxing's most anticipated fights.

When Thurman suffered minor injuries in a car accident, the fight was postponed two weeks ago, with no certainty of when it would be rescheduled, though all signs point to June.

That would mean Porter will go into the biggest fight of his career coming off a one-year layoff, which he did not want. Furthermore, he has put in a nearly full training in preparation for the March 12 bout, which was scheduled to air in prime time on CBS from the Mohegan Sun resort in Uncasville, Connecticut.

Not wanting to waste his camp and wanting to simulate a real fight, Porter (26-1-1, 16 KOs) announced Monday that he will make the unusual move of facing Lanardo Tyner (30-10-2, 19 KOs) in a 12-round exhibition bout -- as in, not an official fight. The exhibition is scheduled to take place at 10 p.m. ET Saturday at Porter's gym, the Porter Hy-Performance Center in Las Vegas.

Porter and Tyner will wear headgear and use 16-ounce gloves (instead of the eight-ounce gloves used by professional welterweights). The fighters will weigh in the day before the match, but they said there will be no involvement from the Nevada State Athletic Commission. Unofficial judges will score the fight, and a professional referee will be used to give the bout the atmosphere of an authentic fight night.

""We decided to do this because we needed the things associated with a big fight -- the atmosphere, the crowd, the lights,"" said Kenny Porter, Shawn's father and trainer. ""We're going to have everything a big fight will have -- a weigh-in the [day] before, the referee, the ring card girls. Mentally and physically, Shawn needs this because he hasn't fought in [nine] months.""

The exhibition will be streamed live on the Premier Boxing Champions Facebook page. Following the exhibition, Porter will host a 30-minute live chat with fans on the same Facebook page.

""When I found out about March 12 not happening because of what happened to Keith, I tried to move forward to fight someone else,"" Shawn Porter said. ""But given the level of that fight with Keith, there wasn't anything for me, really. So my dad and I decided to do this exhibition. I'm not getting paid. This is 100 percent for anybody out there who loves to see me compete and perform. Lanardo Tyner is a veteran who has fought almost everybody, and he'll provide good excitement.

Kenny Porter said his son continued to train when the fight with Thurman (26-0, 22 KOs) was postponed, and the exhibition against Tyner will help him maintain his focus.

""We were getting off a plane in Big Bear [California] for training camp when we heard that Keith had been injured and couldn't fight on March 12.

espn.com,,Isaiah Thomas of Boston Celtics says he'd love to pick mind of New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady,"['Tim Macmahon', 'Anthony Olivieri', 'Dave Mcmenamin', 'Michael C', 'Royce Young', 'Kevin Arnovitz', 'Chris Forsberg', 'Zach Lowe', 'Baxter Holmes', 'Ian Begley']","WALTHAM, Mass. -- Boston Celtics point guard Isaiah Thomas on Tuesday expressed a desire to meet New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady to pick the four-time Super Bowl champion's brain about winning, game preparation and leadership.

Editor's Picks Schemin' Stevens: Boston's maestro with the clipboard Brad Stevens is a walking encyclopedia of NBA sets and actions, and he's distinguished himself as a master of the dry-erase board. Watch Grizzlies-Celtics, 7 ET on ESPN & WatchESPN.

""It would just probably be like sitting down with Kobe [Bryant],"" said Thomas, who has raved about a private one-on-one interaction with the retiring Los Angeles Lakers guard that occurred during Bryant's final visit to TD Garden in December.

""I got the chance to talk to Kobe. I'm real good friends with Floyd Mayweather, so I get to pick guys-like-that's brains. I just would like to sit down and actually meet [Brady] and also just pick his brain about winning championships and how he goes about his day, how he prepares. I like his preparation to everything. I like to pick guys' brains, especially the best in the business, best in their field, and see what he has to say to me. Hopefully I can make it happen.""

Thomas, an unabashed Denver Broncos fan, laughed when asked if he would reveal to Brady that he supports one of New England's rivals.

""He shouldn't be mad at that. I didn't grow up here,"" said Thomas, a Tacoma, Washington, native. ""It's not like I grew up here and I'm not a Patriots fan. But I'm a fan of his. I like how he carries himself. He carries himself like he's the best quarterback ever.""

Thomas said the idea of meeting Brady came to him during his drive to the Celtics' practice facility on Tuesday and he tweeted his desire for a sit down. He found it amusing that a pack of Celtics reporters lingered at the team's practice facility while Thomas received post-practice treatment in order to talk with him on the topic before a scheduled community appearance.

And Thomas smiled wide when it was suggested that he -- the 60th and final pick of the 2011 NBA draft -- shared similarities with Brady, who was also a late-round pick before putting together a Hall of Fame career.

""Coming into the NFL, he wasn't supposed to be a Pro Bowler, wasn't supposed to be a franchise player, wasn't supposed to win Super Bowls and be arguably the best quarterback ever,"" said Thomas. ""And I want to be on that path. I'm not saying I'm going to be the best player ever, but ... ""

Thomas was interrupted by a follow-up question before stressing that he'd like to learn from Brady's leadership abilities.

""I just want to grow,"" said Thomas. ""Not just being a basketball player but being a leader in all aspects, all facets of the game. And why not learn from the best? Especially, I think it's better to learn from different guys in different sports in how they lead and how they get respect from their teammates.

""Like I said, I would love to pick his brain, ask him a few questions. I got to do it with Kobe. I got to do it with Floyd Mayweather, always do it with him and things like that. [Peyton] Manning's retired, so I can't do it with him. So I'd love to do it with Brady.""",[]

espn.com,,"What we learned from upset losses for McGregor, Holm at UFC 196",['Brett Okamoto'],"One of the more memorable chapters in UFC history was written over the weekend, as two of the sport's biggest stars suffered upset defeats at the hands of two of its grittiest fighters.

Nate Diaz put Stockton, California, on the map once again, by submitting Conor McGregor in the second round of a non-title welterweight fight that headlined UFC 196. Shortly before that, Miesha Tate shook the female bantamweight division again by pulling off a come-from-behind win over champion Holly Holm.

Here's what mattered most from last weekend in mixed martial arts:

The line between ambitious and crazy is as fine as it comes

Conor McGregor, left, dominated the first round on his feet before running out of gas in a second-round submission loss to Nate Diaz at UFC 196. Ed Mulholland for ESPN

Days before McGregor's first UFC loss, his coach, John Kavanagh, told me that one motto the SBG Ireland gym lives by is ""win or learn.""

Within minutes of the Diaz loss, it was evident McGregor had already began the learning process. Standing in the Octagon with UFC commentator Joe Rogan beside him, McGregor didn't hang his head and utter some cliche like ""back to the drawing board."" Instead he addressed what he felt went wrong -- he had been inefficient with his stamina and was probably naive of the reduced effect his potent left hand would have on bigger opponents.

The wheels were already turning. It's a safe bet McGregor will learn from Saturday -- but what a costly lesson. True, there's still UFC gold around his waist. He didn't forfeit his featherweight belt. But a shot at history, a matchup against lightweight champion Rafael dos Anjos that, had McGregor won, would have made him the first to ever simultaneously hold belts in multiple weight classes? That's gone for now.

Editor's Picks Diaz upsets McGregor by 2nd-round submission In a stunner, Nate Diaz made Conor McGregor eat his words, submitting him by rear-naked choke in Round 2 of their welterweight bout Saturday night in the UFC 196 co-main event.

Tate stuns Holm in 5th; Rousey rematch up next Miesha Tate took the bantamweight championship from Holly Holm with a rear-naked choke submission in the fifth round at UFC 196 and will defend her title against Ronda Rousey, Dana White said. 1 Related

Which is fine, as far as McGregor is concerned. It was pretty evident his unique self-belief wasn't shaken by Saturday's result. He's 27 years young and believes he has a strong handle on what exactly went wrong against Diaz. Again, win or learn.

In an Instagram post on Sunday, McGregor said, ""I will never apologize for taking a shot."" Even though fighting Diaz at 170 pounds on short notice burned him, I don't think it will be the final risk McGregor takes.

And that will be the line he walks -- biting off more than he can chew and either gulping it down or choking on it. From the first time he started calling out everyone in the featherweight division, there was a sense the latter would happen eventually. Guess it's not the worst thing that it happened against a resilient Diaz, who, by the way, used the opportunity to restructure his contract and make the most money of his career.

Final note: In a response to Jose Aldo, who seemed to revel a bit in McGregor's loss on social media, McGregor responded, ""When the history books are written, I showed up. You showed up on Twitter."" That is damn hard to argue. McGregor did show up -- possibly ill-advisedly so. He did lose. And it was one of the best nights of MMA in years.

Saturday was good for Miesha Tate -- and Ronda Rousey

Miesha Tate cemented herself as one of the best of her era by rallying to submit bantamweight champion Holly Holm late in Round 5. Ed Mulholland for ESPN

Tate's fifth-round submission win over Holm has to be considered the best win of her decorated career and the gritty, down-to-the-wire feel of it is true to her identity. Her offense sputtered at times, but the fact she spent most of the evening standing with Holm and looked relatively unscathed at the press conference speaks to the improvement of her striking. A titleholder in UFC and Strikeforce, Tate has cemented herself as one of the best of her era.

UFC president Dana White told SportsCenter Rousey will be next. Rousey's coach, Edmond Tarverdyan, texted ESPN.com they would ""be ready for Miesha."" Tarverdyan did not offer any ideas on a date.

Regardless of the date, Saturday's result can't be anything but a good thing for Rousey's confidence. Tate, a rival she has already beaten twice, now holds the title. Holm, the woman she lost badly to in November, has been proven beatable. Whether Rousey comes back sooner than expected to fight Tate or opts to sit out, as planned, until late in the year, her comeback feels closer after this weekend.

And don't mourn the death of the Holm-Rousey rematch too much. It's still a good bet to happen. Tate has just added another layer to the competition, which isn't a bad thing.",[]

At that point, Flynn had started two NFL games. But the Seattle Seahawks took a shot on him, signing Flynn to a three-year, $26 million deal with $10 million guaranteed. Flynn lost the starting job to Russell Wilson and ended up throwing nine total passes as a member of the Seahawks.

It was that way before the two fought in November and it has been that way since. At this point, Lenny Fresquez, Holm's longtime manager, has suggested she simply refuse to discuss the topic. So far at least, Holm hasn't

UFC 196: McGregor vs. Diaz Where: MGM Grand, Las Vegas

When: Saturday

TV: PPV, 10 p.m. ET

""The media, a lot of them have 'RR' on their mind,"" Fresquez told ESPN.com. ""As a matter of fact, I told Holly to quit answering the Ronda questions. Say, 'No comment. Next question.' Why are we talking about Ronda?""

Holm (10-0), a former world boxing champion-turned UFC bantamweight titleholder, will make her first title defense Saturday against Miesha Tate (17-5) at UFC 196 inside MGM Grand Garden Arena. The championship bout will co-headline the pay-per-view event, along with a non-title welterweight fight featuring Conor McGregor and Nate Diaz.

Should Holm win, the Rousey questions won't stop. In fact, they'll be as loud as ever. Holm, of course, scored the biggest upset in UFC history four months ago, when she knocked out the previously unbeaten Rousey at UFC 193 in Melbourne, Australia. Rousey, 29, has sworn she'll be back although there is no exact timeframe for her return.

The situation begs the question: What is there to gain this weekend if you're Holm? Other than what should be a terrific payday (Holm will be making her first appearance under a new contract extension signed earlier this year), what's to gain in beating Tate?

Fresh off her upset win, UFC women's bantamweight champion Holly Holm can't go anywhere these days without the topic of Ronda Rousey emerging. Joshua Stebbings for ESPN

Does the shadow of a Rousey rematch not loom over everything Holm does until then?

She agrees that it does -- and that's perhaps the biggest reason to fight someone else. In addition to keeping Holm active, this fight is almost to say: See? This 135-pound division is still moving. It still has a champion who's willing to be in title fights. It exists, without Rousey.

""I want to be Holly Holm, that's my goal,"" Holm said. ""I don't want to just be known as 'Holly, she beat Ronda.' I want to be known as a great fighter and I'm on that journey right now. Everybody was wondering how long it would be until my next fight and guess what? It ended up being sooner, rather than later.

""And not only do I want people to talk about my fights, but let's talk about all the other fighters that are doing such great things in this division. Miesha Tate has over 20 fights. She might have more than anyone else in the division. Look, did Ronda do a lot for the sport? Yes. Did she do it by herself? No.

""I guess my hope is that I want people to see all of us and not just one person. When they think about women's MMA, I want them to think about all the women in this division.""

It should be noted, Holm was more than willing to take a rematch against Rousey immediately -- she just wasn't confident it would happen within the timeframe the UFC promised.

Initially, UFC president Dana White had indicated Holm's first title defense would come against Rousey and expectations were that it would likely occur at UFC 200 on July 9. According to Fresquez, Holm's camp never felt confident Rousey would make that date.

""We would have loved to see a rematch right away but I knew with the beating she took, there was no way she was going to fight us in July,"" Fresquez said. ""I've been in this game a long time and I know when someone has been hurt. It would have been a disservice to Ronda to have that fight so soon. We hope she gets well but we've never waited for anybody.""

Sure enough, after Holm got her way and booked a fight on March 5, it came out Rousey wouldn't be ready until the end of 2016 at the earliest.

Fresquez says he's not sure how many more fights Holm, 34, has left. While Holm refuses to look past this weekend (she says she was guilty of looking past a fight once in her boxing career and ended up losing by knockout), Fresquez claims he specifically discussed potential opponents with the UFC when negotiating Holm's contract extension.

A rematch against Rousey is certainly part of that plans, but in no way does it start and end with that. Fresquez says a catchweight fight with former Strikeforce and current Invicta FC featherweight champion Cris ""Cyborg"" Justino is definitely a possibility. Holm said she's open to that idea as well.

Holly Holm enjoys the risk that comes with facing Miesha Tate despite a rematch with Ronda Rousey on the horizon, saying, ""It makes me feel like I'm up against something."" Brandon Magnus/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images

""When I met with [UFC CEO Lorenzo Fertitta] and we renewed the contract, we were specific on who we wanted to fight,"" Fresquez said. ""We don't know how much longer Holly has. The UFC better enjoy her while she's fighting. I want her to go out on top, ride into the sunset as the only boxing and MMA world champion.

""I keep telling them, 'You guys don't understand what you have here. You don't understand the history she's making right now.' Get the most out of it.""

Many viewed Holm's decision to fight another opponent before Rousey as a risk. Unexpected results happen in MMA. Holm herself is the best example of that. Tate is a near 3-to-1 underdog going into UFC 196 but she's a former titleholder in Strikeforce and one of the toughest outs at 135 pounds.

Greg Jackson, one of Holm's coaches, described Tate as ""resilient; someone you can beat down in the first four rounds and she'll come back and win the fight in the fifth.""

When asked for her take on that assertion -- that she has more to lose than to gain this weekend -- Holm doesn't even disagree. Tate is a tough fight. A loss would throw a wrench in the biggest rematch in UFC history. There's pressure on Saturday. And that, as the champion, is what Holm wants.

""I don't ever want to feel like I'm being protected for one big fight or that I'm a paper champion,"" Holm said. ""It actually is a big risk for me to take this fight but I like that. It makes me feel like I'm up against something big and that's what I want.""",[]

MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Vikings addressed one of their biggest needs by reuniting new offensive line coach Tony Sparano with a player from his recent past.

The team will sign former San Francisco 49ers guard Alex Boone when the new league year begins Wednesday afternoon, a source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter.

Boone, who played for Sparano in San Francisco last year, should help an offensive line that struggled to protect Teddy Bridgewater the past two years.

The 6-foot-8, 300-pound Boone, who turns 29 on May 4, held out the past two offseasons but started all but one game he played for the 49ers in the past four seasons (59 of 60). He moved from right guard to left guard last season, despite a seeming desire to move out to right tackle.

Boone, who missed the Niners' season finale when he was placed on injured reserve with a right knee injury, is outspoken, criticizing the refs after a close loss to the Arizona Cardinals at home in Week 12 last season. He once defended then-coach Jim Harbaugh by calling him a ""brother"" to local media before an about-face in the 2015 offseason for HBO's cameras, saying he wanted to fight Harbaugh because he drove the team too hard.

Boone spent seven years with the 49ers, including a year on the practice squad. An endangered black rhinoceros at the San Francisco Zoo was named after him in January 2013.

espn.com,2016-03-09 00:00:00,Blogtable: Are Hornets or Blazers a more dangerous playoff sleeper team?  NBA.com,[],"Each week, well ask our stable of scribes across the globe to weigh in on the most important NBA topics of the day  and then give you a chance to step on the scale, too, in the comments below.

BLOGTABLE: Are Thunder a great team? | Deciphering LeBrons cryptic messages? |

More dangerous sleeper playoff team  Hornets or Blazers?

> The more dangerous sleeper team this postseason: Charlotte or Portland?

David Aldridge, TNT analyst: Portland. When you have two players who can each get 30 in a playoff game (Damian Lillard has done it three times already; C.J. McCollum did it last spring against Memphis), you have a chance against just about everyone. And the Blazers role players (Ed Davis, Gerald Henderson, Mason Plumlee, etc.) all stay in their lanes and make themselves available. Lillard, especially, is just about unguardable when he gets space to operate, and McCollum is deadly at the midrange game.

Steve Aschburner, NBA.com: Portland. Damian Lillard is the most lethal player on either the Hornets or the Trail Blazers, and what hes been doing to multiple opponents since the All-Star break particularly would be migraine-inducing were he to do it two or three times early in the best-of-seven series. Charlotte might have a better chance of winning more games in the first round or even advancing to the conference semifinals because of the quality of competition in the East, but that actually argues against any sleeper status. To earn that, youve got to bump off or at least frighten top competition  the Blazers likely will get a chance to do that right away while the Hornets might not survive long enough to do so.

Fran Blinebury, NBA.com: The Hornets because of their location in the Eastern Conference and they play better defense. Any team in the lower portion (6-8) of the West bracket is going to be very overmatched in a first-round series against Golden State, San Antonio or Oklahoma City. Anybody in the top half of the East could be vulnerable to a Charlotte team that is low in turnovers (ranked No. 2) and high in Kemba Walker.

Scott Howard-Cooper, NBA.com: Under the theory, for the sake of conversation, that both get there: Portland. Thats not an easy thing to say right now, with the Hornets going good and the Blazers slightly limping, and I am often praising the work of Charlotte coach Steve Clifford, but its easy to see the Hornets having a lot of trouble making shots. Thats the case anyway, but four to seven games against an opponent that could have a top-10 defense (Cleveland, Boston) or a defense better than average (Toronto) could be too much. Plus, Portland would be in the postseason playing with house money as a team very few people expected to be there in the first place. Thats not to say they would play like a team just happy to make the postseason. The team that has played loose in the regular season, though, could carry the same personality into late-April. Double plus: One of the two teams you want us to choose between has Damian Lillard, one doesnt.

Shaun Powell, NBA.com: Charlotte, even without Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. The Hornets are deeper and less predictable than the Blazers and Kemba Walker is going nuts at the moment and is almost on par with Damian Lillard. Plus the Blazers will likely see the Warriors or Spurs in the first round, while the Hornets will have an easier opponent by comparison. And get this: Imagine how much better the Hornets would be with a healthy Kidd-Gilchrist and had they kept Bismack Biyombo, who is a shot-blocking terror in Toronto.

John Schuhmann, NBA.com: Charlotte. The Hornets have a 3-7 record against the top four teams in the East and the Blazers have a 3-6 record against the top four teams in the West. But the Hornets have a better point differential (with much better defense) in those games, the Blazers may struggle if one of their two stars gets taken out of the offense in a playoff series, and teams 2-4 in the East are much more beatable than teams 2-4 in the West.

Sekou Smith, NBA.com: As entertaining as they have been here recently, I have a hard time seeing the Trail Blazers upsetting the Spurs in the first round (based on the standings right now). Damian Lillard would have to go off for 50 a couple of times in that series to make the Spurs sweat a little bit. But the Hornets and Celtics would be a much more dangerous series for the higher-seeded Celtics. Kemba Walker is having one of the best and most underrated seasons of any point guard in the league. And his supporting cast continues to impress in different ways while also flying under the radar. The Hornets could be a real problem for whoever they match up against in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.

Ian Thomsen, NBA.com: The top four teams in the West are not going to lose in the first round. Nobody is knocking off the Warriors, Spurs, Thunder or Clippers (so long as theyre healthy, of course). Thats why Im giving the edge to the Hornets: If theres going to be an opening-round upset, its happening in the East.

Lang Whitaker, NBA.coms All Ball blog: Portland is dangerous, with a backcourt staffed by two capable scorers, and a collection of above-average players who know their role. As weve seen, they can beat any team in the NBA, although it may be hard to summon that kind of sharpshooting night after night in a seven-game series. Which is why I think Charlotte is the more dangerous postseason team, if only because theyre in the Eastern Conference and should have a more advantageous matchup than Portland. The Hornets have solid players in the backcourt, wings and in the post, and should be able to find/create mismatches all over the court.

espn.com,,St. Louis Cardinals' Michael Wacha hopes to cut down his pitch count,['Mark Saxon'],"FORT MYERS, Fla. -- The St. Louis Cardinals arent interested in asking Michael Wacha to make any major changes, and why would they? Their 24-year-old right-hander has already been a postseason hero and an All-Star.

But they are asking Wacha to make one tweak in the interest of efficiency and, they hope, longevity. They want him to throw more cutters, a pitch that might not lead to as many strikeouts as his mid-90s fastball or cartoon-like changeup, but that could lead to quicker outs and more innings.

Wacha seemed to hit a wall last September -- that month, he had a 7.88 ERA, his strikeout rate plummeted and his walk rate skyrocketed. If Wacha strikes out fewer batters this season, the Cardinals wouldn't necessarily consider that a disappointment. In this case, theyd rather see lower pitch counts than more strikeouts.

Michael Wacha's September struggles in 2015 led the Cardinals to ask the right-hander to pitch to more contact this season in an attempt to lighten his workload. AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh

I know, analytically, that probably wouldnt hold water, but for us, running a pitcher like Michael deeper into games is going to help our odds of winning, manager Mike Matheny said.

The Cardinals have been down this road with a young pitcher before. They often found Shelby Millers outings frustrating because his pitch count would elevate quickly with a succession of foul balls. He would be effective but still rarely reach the late innings. Two Novembers ago, they traded him to the Atlanta Braves. They have had similar discussions about improving pitch efficiency with Carlos Martinez.

Wacha said he is on board with the changes, although his 3.21 career ERA doesn't seem to indicate a need for a major overhaul. Last season, according to Fangraphs, Wacha threw his cutter around 13 percent of the time. He considers the pitch a work in progress, but said it could be an effective weapon in helping him reach the 200-inning plateau for the first time in his career.

When it leaves Wachas right hand, the pitch darts away from right-handed batters and in to lefties. New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera probably threw the best cutter of all time, building a Hall of Fame-caliber career on the one pitch.

That pitch is a miss-contact pitch. If I can miss barrels with it and get some weak contact with it, thats all Im looking for, Wacha said.

Wacha said he threw a few cutters among his 30 pitches Tuesday against the Twins, when he made his Grapefruit League debut, allowing a run on two hits over two innings. Brian Dozier and Eduardo Escobar bunched a couple of singles in the first inning, but neither came off a cutter. Wacha worked a breezy second inning, striking out Carlos Quentin with a cutter.

Michaels never had a problem with strikeouts since his changeup and fastball are such good pitches, but the curveball and cutter have both come long ways, Matheny said. It just deepens what the thought process has to be for the offense.",[]

KANSAS CITY, Mo. - The Kansas City Chiefs were fined and stripped of two draft picks by the NFL for a violation of the league's anti-tampering policy for having improper contact with wide receiver Jeremy Maclin before the start of last year's free-agent signing period.

The Chiefs will lose their third-round draft pick this year and their sixth-round choice next year. The Chiefs were also fined $250,000. Coach Andy Reid was fined $75,000, and general manager John Dorsey was fined $25,000.

The league said the Chiefs contacted Maclin directly during the league's negotiating window that takes place before the signing period. Teams are allowed then to contact only agents for prospective free agents.

The Chiefs, Reid and Dorsey may appeal the penalties. Chairman Clark Hunt said in a statement that they ""will continue to explore our options under the appeal process.""

""While we respect Commissioner [Roger] Goodell and the process, we believe that the penalties proposed in this case are inconsistent with discipline enforced in similar matters -- particularly given the league's inconsistent communication of its policies on contact with potential free agents,'' Hunt said.

""As an organization, we take great care to conduct ourselves with integrity and operate within the guidelines of the NFL. We have been fully cooperative and transparent with the league in this matter, and we are disappointed with the league's decision. I want to make it clear that I fully support the leadership of both Coach Reid and John Dorsey.""

Troy Vincent, the NFL's executive vice president of football operations, said in a release announcing the decision that in ""assessing discipline, the goal is to balance the seriousness of the violation of an important and longstanding competitive rule (the Anti-Tampering Policy), with appropriate recognition of the club's history (no prior offenses), and the cooperation shown by both the club and individual employees. The discipline should be sufficient both to deter future violations and encourage cooperation in future investigations. The assessment of discipline here accounts for the fact that the club and its personnel were fully cooperative and forthcoming in the investigation. In this case, our staff had full access to all of the information requested, including electronic and telephone records, and unrestricted access to all club people whom we sought to interview.''

If they lose this year's third-round pick, the Chiefs would have seven selections in this year's draft. They have an extra fifth-round pick acquired in a trade last year with the Seattle Seahawks.",[]

espn.com,,Few viewers complained to FCC about ads for daily fantasy sites,"['Sheil Kapadia', 'Vaughn Mcclure', 'Tory Barron', 'Mike Reiss', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Adam Teicher', 'Eric Williams', 'Jeff Legwold', 'Jim Trotter', 'Kevin Seifert']","Despite the social media outrage over what some television viewers said was an excessive, even obnoxious, barrage of ads for daily fantasy sites, the actual government regulators who oversee such content received just about a dozen complaints during the height of the ads last fall.

The 15 complaints, provided in response to a Freedom of Information Act request submitted by Outside the Lines, cited viewers' displeasure with the content of the ads, as well as issues with the contests themselves.

They include complaints received from August through Nov. 24, 2015. During that time, DraftKings and FanDuel ran a combined 60,000 advertising spots across more than 60 networks, according to iSpot.tv.

The Federal Communications Commission regulates broadcast content on network and cable television programming and allows viewers to submit complaints via mail and online. It has specific rules for advertisements for gaming and lotteries that relate to state laws on gambling. To date, the FCC hasn't taken any action against either daily fantasy company and has not taken a position on whether they violate any gambling advertising rules.

While daily fantasy companies have insisted they are not gambling, that designation is being tested legally in a number of states, and some have outright banned it.

To give some idea of the volume of complaints the FCC usually receives, more than 200 letters came in after NBC's broadcast of the 2012 Super Bowl XLVI halftime show that featured rapper M.I.A., who at one point was seen giving the middle finger to the camera. (The FCC has greater regulatory authority over broadcast content than cable.)

Although fewer in volume, the complaints against daily fantasy ads to the FCC mirror the tone of the public criticism on social media, with one viewer in Mission Viejo, Calif., writing, ""I am revolted by the amount of advertising for so called 'Fantasy Football' websites such as DraftKings and FanDuel. I thought online gambling in the USA was illegal.""

The letter continues: ""My wife's father died as a result of the financial stress from gambling. I see the tears well up in her eyes when she sees this blatant and unabashed promotion and glamorization of wagering.""

A complaint from a viewer in Union City, New Jersey, read: ""... many young children watch these games i think that it is a deeply disturbing message that we are giving them. Ads that promote gambling and the mentality that you can get rich quick by betting on sports events ... please remove them from our televised sporting events!!! I consider it dangerous.""",[]
espn.com,,Lleyton Hewitt natural fit as Australia Davis Cup captain,"['Niall Seewang', 'Greg Garber', 'Mark Hodgkinson', 'Nic Atkin', 'Peter Bodo', 'Pa Sport', 'Bonnie D', 'Espn Com', 'Espn Staff', 'Jim Caple']","Lleyton Hewitt stared down so many challenges during his storied playing career but the test he now faces as Australia's Davis Cup captain may be as delicate and difficult as any he faced with racket in hand.

Hewitt's first assignment as captain ended with a comprehensive 3-1 loss to the U.S. on Sunday, forcing Australia out of this year's Davis Cup fight and into the promotion/relegation round in September.

Many captains and coaches struggle to achieve their desired results due to a lack of talent. That shouldn't be a problem for Hewitt for the foreseeable future.

At his disposal are two of the best young players in the world (Bernard Tomic and Nick Kyrgios), a prodigiously talented teenager (Thanasi Kokkinakis), a dangerous world No. 77 (Sam Groth) and a rookie doubles player who took to the pressure-cooker Davis Cup environment at Kooyong like a seasoned pro (John Peers). This current crop of Australians is bursting at the seams with talent.

Hewitt's s biggest issue will be trying to make the team greater than the sum of its parts. And his first point of order will be to quell a potential feud between his two premier players -Tomic and Kyrgios.

The volatile Kyrgios, ranked No. 27 in the world, left the home side severely weakened when he withdrew from the tie with a virus. Of course, a virus can floor anyone - as Hewitt was quick to point out in the aftermath of the defeat. But that didn't stop Tomic from questioning the legitimacy of his teammate's illness.

Tomic's comments during and after his defeat to John Isner showed there is huge tension bubbling below the surface between the Queenslander and Kyrgios.

""Nick's sitting down in Canberra. Bulls--- he's sick,"" Tomic muttered to Hewitt during a change of ends, before adding: ""Two times he done it, two times he faked it"", he said, referring to Kyrgios' late withdrawal from last year's win over the Czech Republic.

When questioned about the remark post-match, a refreshingly honest Tomic couldn't, or perhaps wouldn't, bite his tongue.

""[The courtside comment] was in the heat of the moment,"" Tomic said.

""Obviously I would have loved for him to be here but he's sick, like he says he is, and for me it will be interesting to see if he plays [the next ATP tour event in] Indian Wells.

""If he plays in Indian Wells, he's definitely lost a little bit of my respect.""

Of course, Kyrgios hit back the following day on Twitter.

Just don't expect me to have your back anytime soon.  Nicholas Kyrgios (@NickKyrgios) March 6, 2016

A diplomatic Hewitt, sitting alongside Tomic during the closing press conference, said he couldn't question Kyrgios' commitment, nor could he fault Tomic's efforts during the previous three days.

""In the heat of the moment, frustrations [can boil over]. Obviously Bernie wasn't 100 percent [due to a wrist complaint] and ... he gave absolutely 100 percent in his matches here and did everything I asked him to,"" he said.

""For me, I asked Nick to come down here and prepare and give it a shot ... but he got ruled out by the medical staff. For me both boys did exactly what I asked them to.""

Robert Prezioso/Getty Images

Like a father trying to calm two fighting siblings, Hewitt couldn't, and can't, afford to favour one over the other.

He has two huge weapons at his disposal in Tomic and Kyrgios, still just 23 and 20 years of age respectively. The duo, and to a lesser extent, Kokkinakis, Peers and Groth, should be the foundation Hewitt can build on in his dream of taking Australia back to the top of world tennis.

And it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to suggest that Australia, if Hewitt can develop a cohesive team unit, may once again reach the heights of the late 1990s and early 2000s - when Hewitt himself, Mark Philippoussis and Pat Rafter, among others, collected two Davis Cup titles and two runners-up awards from 1999-2003.

Hewitt would certainly have learned a lot from his first outing as skipper against the Americans. Viruses, late selection dramas, a return to the court after his retirement earlier this year, injuries, feuding players, a deflating defeat - this tie was no easy first-up assignment.

But Hewitt took a lot of positives from the three hot and trying days.

""It was obviously pretty at times, [with] the late changes and trying to work out the best situation to try and give ourselves the best opportunity to at least go to the fifth match,"" he said. ""[But] I enjoyed it with the boys. Everyone came and gave absolutely 100 percent, and they did absolutely everything that me and the coaching staff asked of them the whole time, and that's all I can want from these guys - turning up and giving their best for me, and trusting in me what I'm telling them, as well.""

From first glances during three intense days at Kooyong, it appears Hewitt is a natural fit in the captain's seat.

A natural motivator, the former world No. 1 often looked more like a veteran cornerman during a boxing bout - cajoling, questioning, and trying to inspire his charges throughout the tie.

And if anyone can command respect from the talented but occasionally wayward weapons at his disposal, it should be Hewitt, Australia's most successful Davis Cup player.",[]
espn.com,,Giant Killers: New metric likes Michigan State's chances for deep run,"['Jordan Brenner', 'Peter Keating']","Insider

Michigan State coach Tom Izzo joins Mike & Mike to share his thoughts on how the NCAA tournament will shape up this year and to express why it's been a tough year for coaches due to the number of surprising upsets and setbacks. (1:40)

Ever since we remodeled the basement here at GK Central, we have had more room to work on advanced mathematics and take a look at some questions weve been meaning to address for a long time.

For example, our statistical model combs through historical data to find the traits common to the teams that pull off or succumb to big NCAA tournament upsets. But weve always wanted to find ways beyond citing the same old key metrics to get across how those teams play. And now, with help from our Giant Killer colleagues at Furman University, we have developed a new toy for doing just that: similarity. For any given team, our similarity method shows the five most comparable Giants or Killers from our historical database (which dates back to 2007), measured by what matters to Giants and Killers. Knowing a programs most similar squads, you can get a better feel for its style -- and how it will fare.

The basic math behind this is pretty straightforward. (But feel free to skip this paragraph if you prefer to hide your vegetables under the mashed potatoes.) Suppose that on a graph, Point A is 3 inches away from Point B horizontally, and 4 inches away vertically. Using the Pythagorean theorem we all learned in high school, we can figure out pretty quickly that the distance from A to B along a straight line is 5 inches. In the same way, we can combine distances on any two metrics and see how close two teams are. For instance, Oklahoma plays at a quick tempo and has faced a tough schedule this season. If we look only at those two scales, the most similar teams to Oklahoma in 2016 -- other programs that have played at both a fast pace and against strong opponents -- would be UCLA, Wake Forest and Iowa State. Our similarity method extends this technique to measure the distance between teams while balancing all of the shooting, rebounding, turnover and pace statistics that define Giants and Killers. And then it looks for each teams closest neighbors.

Now that the basic math lesson is out of the way, heres what caught our eye once we crunched the numbers. First, to the Giants:",[]

espn.com,,Valspar Championship holds special place for Jordan Spieth,"['Ben Fawkes', 'Gordon Simpson', 'Kevin Maguire', 'Pa Sport', 'Espn Staff', 'Jason Sobel', 'Dottie Pepper', 'Bob Harig', 'Michael Collins', 'Sam Bruce']","PALM HARBOR, Fla. -- There is barely enough time in the day for Jordan Spieth to sit back, relax and enjoy the accomplishments that have seen him ascend to the No. 1 golfer in the world.

Of course, he is not satisfied, and expects to build on his success, so he's not apt to relish the past too much. And on the occasions where he might want to reminisce, there is travel or business or practice or actual tournament rounds to keep him busy.

But Spieth, 22, found some time Tuesday night to catch a bit of the 2015 Valspar Championship with his caddie, Michael Greller -- a tournament he often says was a big factor in a big year.

""It was pretty exciting to watch,'' Spieth said Wednesday prior to his pro-am at the Innisbrook Resort, where the Valspar Championship begins Thursday. ""Had a few tough up and downs the last few holes, made a few putts and ultimately knocked in a long one in a playoff and really got a nice jump-start to closing out tournaments in '15.

""And it continued throughout the year.''

It would be a stretch to say that Spieth would not have gone on to win the Masters had he not prevailed in a three-hole playoff a month earlier on the Copperhead course against Patrick Reed and Sean O'Hair.

But look where Spieth was at that point a year ago: Although he had won the previous fall at the Australian Open and the Hero World Challenge, he had but a single PGA Tour title to his name. He was ranked 10th in the world, and had three top-10 finishes in five starts before arriving at Innisbrook.

And yet ... he wasn't really Jordan Spieth.

Not a major champion. Not a multiple-major winner stalking the Grand Slam. Not a FedEx Cup champ, either.

All of that's changed in a year, and the Valspar helped propel him to that greatness.

""It was huge,'' he said. ""It was the first time I ever made a putt to win a professional tournament.''

Spieth followed with a second-place finish at the Valero Texas Open, a playoff loss at the Shell Houston Open and then a 4-shot victory at the Masters where he matched Tiger Woods' tournament scoring record.

The Texan added three more victories, including the U.S. Open and the Tour Championship, then began this year with a win at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions.

""Winning on any tour anywhere is always a confidence boost, and as golfers, we don't get to do that often given how many participants you have and how tough the competition is,'' said seventh-ranked Henrik Stenson, who missed last year's Valspar playoff by a stroke. ""Winning at the right time is definitely huge for your confidence and why not make it here? It kick-started last year for Jordan and [this] year I wouldn't mind getting a win. It's been awhile.''

Although there have been more modest results for Spieth in recent weeks -- he tied for fifth in Abu Dhabi and was second in Singapore -- he is ahead of his 2015 pace and looking to find his form heading to Augusta National just as he did a year ago.

""I really need to get my putter going,'' said Spieth, who missed the cut at the Northern Trust Open three weeks ago and tied for 17th last week at the WGC-Cadillac Championship. ""Hasn't really clicked yet. Feels fine. Haven't quite gone in yet. But they will. Wedge play needs to just improve.

""But my driving of the golf ball is better. I feel better than it was last year and my iron striking has been consistent from last week into this week.''

If ever there is a place where Spieth can fall back on some good vibes, it is at the Copperhead course, where not only did he win a year ago but also had a significant career achievement in 2013.

Just 19 at the time and with no status on either the Web.com Tour or the PGA Tour, Spieth came to Innisbrook after a whirlwind month that saw him play his fourth consecutive week after two tournaments in South America and another in Puerto Rico.

""I came (here) running on fumes,'' he said.

Spieth had done well in two starts on the Web.com Tour, but elected to take a sponsor exemption to play in Puerto Rico, a PGA Tour event opposite the WGC at Doral. He tied for second, winning about $300,000 and putting him approximately $150,000 short of special temporary status on the PGA Tour.

Why is that important? Achieving that would allow him unlimited sponsor exemptions, which mean more chances to play PGA Tour events and secure playing privileges for the following year.

""With two holes remaining, I was 1 shot out of the top 10 and 1 shot out of that dollar amount to lock up special temporary status,'' Spieth recalled. ""On the 17th hole, there was a back right pin and I hit it in the rough and short. I hit a flop shot that bounded into the pin and went in for birdie. Then a par save out of the sand on the 18th hole where I made about a 5-footer.

""That was probably the biggest smile I had other than tapping in at Augusta last year. I was now a member of the PGA Tour in 2013 when four weeks prior I didn't even have Web.com status. It was a very special moment. That's why Tampa and the Valspar Championship hold a pretty special place in my career.''

Spieth has plenty of work ahead, whether it be at Innisbrook or in his next starts prior to the Masters at the WGC-Dell Match Play and the Shell Houston Open.

But he admits that he approaches it differently than in the past.

""It's a different feeling,'' he said. ""It's a good feeling. Just builds more and more confidence. I feel like instead of trying to get into contention and then test out how to close, now we have a formula to be able to close out tournaments.

""Whether the breaks go your way or not, that's not for me to necessarily say. But mentally I'm there where I'm in contention and I feel more comfortable now and I'm most confident when I arrive prior to the week even starting, whether it's here or anywhere else.

""Anytime you've come to a place where you've won, you feel very, very comfortable because it's already happened, so you can visualize it.''",[]

(1:18)

Rickie Fowler, fresh off a tie for eighth at the WGC-Cadillac Championship, made a hole-in-one Monday at a charity golf event to earn the Els for Autism Foundation $1 million.

A bevy of PGA Tour pros helped Fowler and Els celebrate the ace that came from 113 yards on a ""bonus"" 19th hole during the Els for Autism Pro-am at the Old Palm Golf Club in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, according to social media accounts.

Wow...that was cool! #ElsForAutism A video posted by Rickie Fowler (@rickiefowler) on Mar 7, 2016 at 2:10pm PST

""Kind of nothing to lose,"" Fowler told the Golf Channel after making the hole-in-one. ""Just having fun. It's a small target. It doesn't happen very often. Pretty cool to do that for Ernie and the foundation.""

Els lifted Fowler into the air as a crowd of people, including major champions Rory McIlroy and Louis Oosthuizen, celebrated around them.

espn.com,,"Pedro Alvarez deal gives Orioles another lefty bat, muddies OF picture",['Eddie Matz'],"SARASOTA, Fla. -- The Baltimore Orioles went into the offseason looking for left-handed bats. Nearly three weeks into spring training, they got another one.

Monday night, the Orioles reached agreement with Pedro Alvarez on a one-year deal worth $5.75 million. The pact, which is pending medical review, gives an already potent offense yet one more power bat. By adding Alvarez -- the former Pirate whose 36 homers led the National League in 2013 -- to a lineup that already features Chris Davis, Adam Jones, Mark Trumbo, Manny Machado and J.J. Hardy, Baltimore now has six players whove hit 30 bombs in a season.

It also gives an Orioles team that was heavily right-handed last season a little more balance among the projected regulars. Alvarez, who will likely slot in as the teams primary designated hitter, and fellow offseason signing Hyun Soo Kim, give manager Buck Showalter two more lefty swingers to go along with slugging first baseman Davis, not to mention catcher Matt Wieters, who's a switch-hitter.

Its worth noting that despite Baltimores righty-heavy lineup last season, it actually did a much better job against right-handed pitchers than lefties. As a team in 2015, Baltimore's .752 OPS against righties was second best in the American League, while its .662 OPS against southpaws was the ALs third worst. The 90-point differential, which was the second largest in baseball behind the Rockies, isnt likely to improve with the addition of Alvarez, whose career OPS against lefties is nearly 200 points lower than it is against righties (.601/.794).

""Let's hope he shows up."" Ryan Flaherty, Orioles infielder, on Pedro Alvarez

Defensively, although Alvarez isnt likely to see much time in the field, his addition further complicates what was already a pretty complicated outfield situation. As recently as Monday, the thinking was that Trumbo would be the regular designated hitter. Acquired in December in a trade with Seattle, Trumbos best position is first base. But the Orioles already have some guy named Davis there. Trumbo also has experience playing the outfield, but hes not nearly as effective there. For his career, hes accounted for 12 defensive runs saved as a first baseman, and minus-12 DRS in the outfield despite playing roughly 1,000 fewer innings there.

With Alvarez in the fold, Trumbo will need to play somewhere in the field. Its possible he could be part of a platoon in left field with Kim, who came to camp as the projected starter but has struggled at the plate, going hitless in his first 18 at-bats. As for right field, even though Davis is an excellent athlete whos played there some in the past, it doesnt sound like the Orioles have any plans on moving him out there so that Trumbo can play first. At least not on a regular basis.

""I think Im probably going to be at first base most of the time,"" said Davis on Tuesday morning. ""Thats the indication Ive gotten.""

Buck Showalter also indicated that no matter what happens with the Orioles roster, Davis will be his primary first baseman. That said, the manager was very tight-lipped about anything regarding Alvarez, which is hardly surprising in the wake of the Dexter Fowler debacle that took place earlier in spring training.

""Weve been down this road a few times,"" said Showalter. ""I'm sworn to double-secret probation, and Im going to honor that protocol.""

As of now, theres been no sign of Alvarez in Sarasota, where the Birds are hosting a day game against the Red Sox.

Earlier Monday, Baltimore infielder Ryan Flaherty was asked what he thinks about the Orioles reportedly agreeing to terms with Alvarez, his former Vanderbilt teammate. Said Flaherty: ""Let's hope he shows up.""",[]

The sanction for Brezhniva, who won European team sprint gold in 2013 and 2014, was backdated from June 22, 2015, the Russian anti-doping agency said in a statement, without specifying the nature of the offense.

Brezhniva failed an out-of-competition test while at home in a case of ""negligence,"" Russia head cycling coach Sergei Kovpanets told the R-Sport agency.

Russia's road and track cycling programs have long been dogged by doping, including a long-running and still-unresolved case regarding two-time Olympic bronze medalist Olga Zabelinskaya.

espn.com,,League of Legends prodigy Faker carries his country on his shoulders,['Mina Kimes'],"A FEW DAYS later, I turn onto a side street in Seoul's Gangnam District, following a sign that says 02 PC BANG. Down several flights of steps, I enter a dark, windowless room furnished with rows of computers. An older woman sits near the door, next to a display of energy drinks. The cafe is silent except for League's telltale sound effects (coins tinkling, weapons firing). Near the back of the room, three Korean men sit shoulder to shoulder, tapping at their keyboards. One of them, a 27-year-old named Kim Hyun-jun, says he comes here a couple of times a week, usually for five hours at a time.

When I ask him whether he's heard of Faker, he looks at me as if I've sprouted a third eye. ""Of course,"" he replies, while his friends snicker. ""Everyone knows him. Faker is God.""

Korea has more than 12,000 PC bangs, many of which are open 24 hours a day. They started cropping up in the late 1990s, when the Asian financial crisis spurred the government to invest in broadband. According to OGN's Wi, the recession helped spawn the Korean eSports craze. ""The unemployment rate went up, and there was a huge amount of people looking for things to do,"" he says. ""So they started playing video games."" Today it seems counterintuitive that in a country where young children carry smartphones that aren't yet available in the West, people still flock to old-fashioned Internet cafes. But there are sociological reasons for their persistence. In Seoul, where many families live in small apartments, kids are less likely to play shooter games in their living rooms. Instead, they escape to PC bangs.

The first eSport to sweep the country was StarCraft, a real-time strategy game that's as complicated as chess. StarCraft was released in 1998; by the middle of the 2000s, Korea boasted a thriving professional league, a regulatory agency (the Korean eSports Association, or KeSPA) and two cable networks dedicated to gaming. But at the end of the decade, StarCraft was losing steam -- just in time for Riot Games, a small company based in Santa Monica, California, to bring League of Legends to market. Riot doesn't break out user numbers by country, but more than 27 million people play the game every day. When professional teams started to form in Korea in 2012, an advanced infrastructure of coaches, sponsors and training houses was already in place.

Faker lives with his teammates in an apartment on the fringes of Seoul, in an area populated by half-empty office buildings. The players share bedrooms. When they wake up around noon, a cook comes in and prepares lunch. Afterward, they walk a few minutes to their training center. For the next eight hours, they practice by scrimmaging against other teams, occasionally taking breaks to study game film. Faker usually practices by himself for at least four more hours.

When I visit the facility, SKT's coaches, Choi ""L.i.E.S."" Byoung-hoon and Kim ""kkOma"" Jeong-gyun, are in their shared office, sitting side by side in matching leather chairs. I ask kkOma, who is playing League at his computer, what he thinks of the Korean Exodus. ""It depends on the results of this year's championship,"" he says, one hand rapidly clicking on a mouse, eyes locked onto the screen. ""If Korea wins, it isn't a problem. If another region wins, maybe there is.""

When I mention Faker, kkOma furrows his brow. ""It's a team game,"" he says. ""When the team doesn't do well, Faker doesn't do well. He looks as good as he does because there's a baseline set by the rest of the team.""

Outside the coaches' office, God himself stands in the hall, gazing at a picture of the 2013 roster posing with the Summoner's Cup in Los Angeles, the players beaming as they each point a finger to the sky. I ask him whether he's still in touch with the players who left Korea, and he says no. ""I'm busy practicing.""

Faker grew up in the Gangseo District, not far from the SKT training center. He and his younger brother were raised by his father (he says he hasn't seen his mother in a while) and his grandparents. From an early age, he was an autodidact, the kind of kid who solved Rubik's Cubes and read foreign books to teach himself new languages. His father, a carpenter, was slightly bewildered by his precocious son. Sang-hyeok always loved games -- learning them, practicing them, conquering them. He discovered League when it launched in Korea in 2011, and he started playing it around the clock; before long, he was so good the Korean server struggled to match him with players of equivalent skill. When SKT approached him, he had just started high school. After joining the team, he dropped out.

Faker shows me the computer room where he practices, then leads me to a lounge furnished with a massive leather sectional, a shelf of trophies and a rack of sneakers from New Balance, one of SKT's sponsors. A cooler is stocked with sports drinks provided by another sponsor, Pocari Sweat. The sofa is big enough for sprawling, but Faker perches on the edge, his hands clasped together. When I ask him to describe his life at the training center, he paints an ascetic picture. He has no real hobbies outside of gaming, and he's never had a girlfriend. The walls of his room are blank. He likes water.

I tell him I've read that he owns a couple of plants and ask him what they look like. ""There's a tree-ish one and a grass-ish one,"" he replies. He pats the tufts of hair above his temples, a recurring tic.

Initially, SKT's coaches were put off by Faker's shyness. One was even worried he might have a speech disorder -- some days, he uttered only a few words. ""He didn't talk very much, so we had reservations about whether he would be good in a team environment,"" Choi says.

I think if I practice hard, I will indisputably be the best again. - Faker

But when Faker talks about League, he visibly relaxes. I ask him how he can play so many champions -- while most gamers have mastered a few characters, he's played more than 30 at the professional level -- and his eyes light up. ""My strength is in understanding the flow of the game, when to fight and when not to fight,"" he explains. ""Regardless of which champion I play, that strength is there."" As he recounts his professional career, details trickle out. At the 2013 world championship in Los Angeles, his team took him to Universal Studios; he smiles broadly when he recounts the Transformers ride. Sometimes, he opens his practice sessions to fans and plays American pop music in the background. His favorite artist is Taylor Swift.

He admits that fame perplexes him. League fans on Naver, a Korean Internet portal, track his every move. A recent Reddit post ruminating on whether he was flirting with a Korean television presenter drew hundreds of comments. When he makes a rare trip outside SKT's training center, he's often recognized by teenage admirers. ""I usually wear a baseball cap,"" he says.

Faker doesn't like to talk about the offer from China. When I bring it up, his mouth twists a little and he rubs his hair again. ""A lot of players who left say it's been difficult,"" he finally says. ""I think going abroad is a good experience, but personally, I want to stay in Korea and win the world championship again."" I ask him whether he believes he's the best player in the world. ""Not yet,"" he says. ""There are a lot of people on my level now. I think if I practice hard, I will indisputably be the best again.""

DOA AND MONTECRISTO, the American casters, both live in Kyunglidan, a trendy neighborhood with narrow streets lined with jewel-box-sized cafes and craft breweries. We meet there for lunch -- jaeyook bokeum, or stir-fried pork belly -- with Susie Kim, a translator and former StarCraft caster. When I ask the group why Faker is regarded as the best player in the world, MonteCristo, who goes by Monte, jumps in: ""How would you grade a professional athlete? Like, what makes LeBron great?""

I rattle off a few words: athleticism, skill, decision-making.

""It's the same. It's exactly the same,"" Susie says.

The League equivalent of athleticism is called mechanics, which refers to a player's ability to use his mouse and keyboard to make swift movements, like dodging shots. In this respect, Monte says, Faker is peerless. He points me to a video of what is widely seen as the greatest play in League history, clipped from a 2013 game between SK Telecom and the KT Bullets. Faker is dueling another player, Ryu, and they're both playing the same champion, a ninja named Zed. After a brief skirmish, Faker's Zed appears about to die, so he darts away. Then, just when Ryu thinks he has the fight sewn up, Faker unleashes a startling set of moves, cutting down his opponent in a blinding flash. The audience goes nuts. ""He used six different abilities in the span of two seconds,"" Monte says.

Even more impressive, DoA adds, is the breadth of Faker's champion pool, which makes it easier for him to adapt to new patches to the game -- the ""meta,"" in eSports parlance. Because Riot upgrades League every few weeks, players live in perpetual fear of having their favorite champions' skills diminished. Imagine if the NFL suddenly announced next year that rushing touchdowns were worth only five points, or if MLB expanded the strike zone for left-handed pitchers. Although the constantly changing meta keeps the game fresh, it can be agonizing for professionals. Some players never recover from an ill-timed patch.

That's one of the reasons the average eSports career is so short. Professional players typically retire before their mid-20s; like figure skaters, they peak long before then. Older gamers must battle slowing reflexes and fatigue, as well as injuries to their necks and wrists. ""As a male teenager, it's easy to play video games for 16 hours,"" Monte says.

Because many Korean players skip college, their career options after retiring are limited. ""A lot of pro gamers don't come from wealthy backgrounds,"" Susie says. ""A good number of them are doing this because they're supporting their families."" Increasingly, she says, players realize they have limited time to capitalize on their skills, which is driving some of them to leave the country. Although most professional gamers in Korea earn five-digit salaries and a few elite players make over $100,000 (Monte says Faker probably makes more than twice that; SK Telecom declined to comment on his salary), Chinese teams boast massive war chests. One squad, Invictus Gaming, is owned by the son of Wang Jianlin, the richest man in mainland China. This winter, Invictus added four Korean players to its roster.

Pro players also make money by streaming, allowing fans to watch them practice while advertisements pop up. One retired player in China, Wei ""Caomei"" Han-Dong, has said he makes more than $800,000 a year streaming. Korean teams have begun to stream a little, but in general, ""they think it's inefficient,"" says Lee ""CloudTemplar"" Hyun-woo, a retired-gamer-turned-caster. ""In Korea, to make money you have to put up results."" Demand is out there, though. This February, a minor scandal flared up when a Twitch user started streaming Faker's practice games without permission.

Riot Games' Korean headquarters is located near Sinsa Station, a hotbed for plastic surgery. The airy office boasts the usual Silicon Valley trappings: arcade games, a Lego table, even a drum set. League is free to play, but Riot makes money -- $1.3 billion last year, according to SuperData Research -- by charging for cheap in-game features such as skins or custom kits for champions. Many of these add-ons become popular after professional players use them.

To stem the flight of Korean players, Riot and KeSPA, the league's regulator, have enacted a few changes. Last fall Riot instituted a new region-locking system that restricts Western teams from recruiting too many foreigners. Richard Kwon, Riot's Korean communications chief, hopes to persuade the government to grant reprieves from mandatory military service to successful eSports athletes, as it did for MLB star Shin-Soo Choo. Yet he insists the Korean Exodus is overblown. ""What's different about the Korean scene is there's a very strong amateur scene,"" he says. ""We can find and raise new talent easily.""

Another Riot Games staffer jokes: ""Faker Two.""

Korean workplaces are famed for their emphasis on collectivism. No individual is greater than the group, and no quality matters more than unity. ""Teams will say, 'If a player can't handle the amount of pay he's getting, we'll just send him off,'"" CloudTemplar says. ""'We can start fresh with a new player.'"" Korean players aren't naturally gifted at video games, he says -- they're just better trained, with superior coaches. ""That's probably our greatest strength,"" he says.

But what happens, I ask, when the coaches start to leave? ""We'll just have to put in even more effort,"" he says.",[]

espn.com,,Ellen Hart continuing elite athletic career and fight against eating disorders,"['Andrew Hood', 'Greg Garber', 'Rico Longoria', 'Roger Robinson', 'Velonews Com', 'Competitor Com', 'Mario Fraioli', 'Caley Fretz', 'Sarah Gearhart', 'Doug Williams']","In late August, Ellen Hart traveled to Austria for the Ironman 70.3 World Championship. Hart, 57, had been hesitant about making the long trip and about some aspects of the course, yet decided to go for it when her husband and son made it a family excursion.

They cheered her on as she won her age group by more than eight minutes.

At the finish, Hart was so emotional she was crying. Her 18-year-old son Ryan wrapped her in a bear hug and told her, ""It's OK, mom. You really brought it today.""

Eighteen days later in Chicago, she won the International Triathlon Union sprint-distance world championship. Two days after that she added the ITU Olympic-distance world title.

Hart then dominated her group at Kailua-Kona in Hawaii 30 days later to win the Ironman World Championship by more than 22 minutes, roaring back on the bike and run after finishing 15th in the swim. Again, tears flowed as she saw her husband, Rob, near the finish.

""Coming down Alii Drive must be one of the sweetest moments in all of sports,"" she says. "" Seeing him there and again having a high-five or a meeting of the eyes, it all of a sudden made me start crying.""

Then came a flight to Australia for the ITU World Duathlon Championship in Adelaide, Australia just a week after Kona.

""I'm not sure what I was thinking,"" she says, laughing. ""'Oh, yeah, do an Ironman and then do a short, hard race many thousands of miles away.'""

She trailed by almost three minutes after the first 10K run, but took the lead in the 40K bike and held it on the 5K finishing run to win by more than three minutes.

The result: Five age-group world championships in 50 days and various distances across Europe, the United States and Australia.

It was a feat no one expected, least of all Hart, who usually isn't as strong in short-distance triathlons where it's harder to overcome her weakest link, the swim. She also had a knee injury. Yet everything came together.

It was hard to grasp while it unfolded, but with three months of reflection she's overwhelmed by a feeling of gratitude. Triathlon is a sport for individuals, but she says the support of ""her team"" of family and friends -- plus a combination of luck, opportunity and hard work -- paid off.

""I was a competitor,"" says Hart, who's been racing on an elite level since the 1980s. ""I brought my 'A' game every single time I showed up for a world championship, five in a row.""

Tim Yount, USA Triathlon's chief operating officer, says no one ever has come close to what Hart has accomplished.

""It's an amazing feat and I can truly say it will go down as probably one of the 10 greatest triathlon feats of history,"" he says. ""I just hope enough people can recognize it and pay attention. And I'm talking about history: elite, pro, age group, youth, para. Put all those in one basket. That's where her performance was last year.""

A place of joy and gratitude

Hart's route to triathlon history was long and layered.

She's evolved from a 22-year-old Harvard grad who finished third in the 10,000 meters at the 1980 U.S. Olympic Trials, to a multi-sport athlete pushing 60 who has won 14 age-group world titles, and says she's ""incredibly happy"" to still be competing.

Ellen Hart never imagined a competitive career that seemed to just be peaking in the early 1980s would still be going strong today. Damian Strohmeyer/The Denver Post via Getty Images

Along the way, she became an attorney; had a high-profile marriage to Denver mayor and secretary of transportation Federico Pena; battled anorexia and bulimia while an athlete; had a movie made about her struggle; helped set up a foundation for that cause; continued to be an advocate for eating disorder awareness; and raised three children, two of whom are older than she was at the '80 Olympic Trials.

Now in a second marriage, she finds herself happier than ever. She laughs, saying she's told her son not to worry that she often cries -- at the end of races and elsewhere -- because she's so in touch with her emotions. Both happiness and sadness ""bubbles up and spills over.""

To her, the past makes the present so sweet.

""I love winning, it's one of the really fun things to do, but it's not that fulfilling and at times it can be a fairly empty feeling if there's no balance to it and no community behind it,"" she says. ""That was part of my experience as a runner in the '80s and that was also when I was suffering from an eating disorder.

""And to really be healthy now, and to be able to reach out and hold people and have them sort of lift me up, is just something that is, well, it's a real contrast to how I used to be as an athlete,"" she says.

""Now that I'm happy and healthy, I thought, 'Oh dear, I probably can't perform well any more,' because you sort of have this image that the driven people are the ones that really excel. Then I realized that I could run from a place of joy and gratitude. It truly feels better than some of the driven-ness and needing to always prove something to myself and other people.""

Hart went into 2015 on a mission to excel. Though she was bothered by a lingering knee injury, she used an anti-gravity treadmill to log hard training runs to avoid wear and tear. Her conditioning coach, Erin Carson, helped her increase specific muscle strength. Coach Neal Henderson had her peaking for the five world championships.

She broke her arm in March, but kept on working. The ""pesky knee"" bothered her, but by putting in extra cycling miles and treadmill work she felt stronger than ever as summer turned to fall. Carson, also Hart's training partner, said the quality of her training was terrific.

Plus, Carson says Hart is special. On a scale of zero to 10 for mind, body and spirit ""Ellen was a 12."" Her foundation as an Olympic-level runner, her intelligence and ""resilient optimism"" allow her to optimize her physical gifts, says Carson.

Yet Carson had no idea Hart, with her nagging pains, would win five world titles.

""I'm a science person, so I love numbers,"" says Carson. ""But the more I learn about sport, there's intangibles in sport that we wish we could put our finger on, like why is that? Why did that happen? How can I duplicate that? And I think it comes down to that spirit.""

Yount agrees. He suspects her knee problem was far worse than he knew.

""She is one of the guttiest performers I've ever seen,"" he says, pointing to her victory in Hawaii. ""You win Kona and you're only 70 percent healthy, it's a true tribute to how good you really are, how much of an athlete you really are.

""The world is coming after Ellen Hart and she rose to the occasion in every single one of those events.""

Making a difference

Before the start of the World Duathlon Championship in Australia, a competitor Hart had never met approached her as she warmed up.

Winning her age group at the World Triathlon Series sprint-distance championships prompted one of several emotional celebrations for Ellen Hart. Rich Cruse/CrusePhoto.com

""She says, 'I just wanted to meet you and say that I had an eating disorder and I was down to 75 pounds and I was hooked up to tubes. But I knew about you and knew that you had recovered and that you were a triathlete and that gave me hope for my recovery'"" recalls Hart. ""And there she was getting ready for the same race.""

Hart says it was as meaningful to her as winning a race. She still makes public speeches about anorexia and bulimia, and she's proud of helping start the Eating Disorder Foundation and her work with other fitness and health agencies and nonprofits. Plus, she knows the 1996 TV movie about her, ""Dying to be Perfect,"" led to greater awareness.

But the incident in Australia reinforced to her that her sport gives her a platform. Recently she was asked to speak to a college triathlon program -- both men and women -- because the coach indicated some of his male athletes, too, have had eating disorders.

""So even though triathlon for me sometimes seems really frivolous and a luxury that I'm getting to do this and spending a lot of time training, I also realize that I have been given this opportunity and given the talent ... and that has some value,"" she says.

She took a break from training for a few weeks before the new year, but is now back in her workout routine. After going so hard last year, she thought she might take it easier in 2016 and cut down on races and do some events she's never done before.

But then again, probably not.

Though she swore last year's race in Kona would be her last full Ironman, she's now leaning toward doing it again because she won't have to qualify. And she'd like to try the duathlon once more. And the half-Ironman is her favorite distance. And she'd like a chance to defend her sprint- and Olympic-distance titles.

Training makes her happy and she says every race day is like a blank canvas, where she can create something new and exciting.

So, Ellen Hart could wind up with another world championship or two (or three?) in 2016.

It's hard not to compete when you're a competitor.

""I never in a million years thought I would be a competitive athlete at age 57,"" she says. ""Never, never, never, never. To be able to do this and travel and meet wonderful people and to stretch and reach and grow as a person and an athlete is just such a gift.""",[]

espn.com,,Nairo Quintana sees a Tour de France win in the near future,"['Andrew Hood', 'Sarah Gearhart', 'Dane Cash', 'Competitor Com', 'Gregor Brown', 'Rico Longoria', 'Phil Gaimon', 'Roger Robinson', 'Doug Williams', 'Pa Sport']","Editor's note: This article originally appeared at VeloNews.com.

With his third career Tour de France appearance on tap this season, Movistar's Nairo Quintana is optimistic that a yellow jersey is within his reach if just a few more things go his way this time.

Quintana's 2015 Tour campaign got off track early in the race, when he lost 1:28 to Sky's Chris Froome in heavy crosswinds in the second stage. However, Quintana battled back in the third week and finished 1:12 behind Froome in second place. To Quintana, that's enough of an indication that he has the tools to pull off the overall win.

""I take it with calm. I've always said that if I work hard, I will be in good shape at the Tour,"" the Movistar rider told a small group of journalists at January's Tour de San Luis. ""Let's hope that bad luck doesn't go with us, and as for the rest, I think, arriving there having worked well, the results will come.""

This year is the first in which Quintana, a two-time winner of the Tour's white jersey as the best young rider in the peloton, won't be able to look to the young riders' classification as a consolation prize for missing out on the overall winner's yellow jersey. Nevertheless, he's confident that he has found a successful Tour formula. As such, the 26-year-old Colombian isn't planning to make any big adjustments to his approach this season.

""My method of training has been good. You saw that the time I lost last year was because of an error or bad luck -- not because of a lack of form -- so I think the preparation is good,"" he said. ""What I do want to plan is the type of races, to be able to reach the Tour not so saturated with racing, but with good training.""

Good preparation or not, Quintana is not underestimating Froome, who was the only rider standing between Quintana and yellow in Quintana's two Tour starts. He acknowledged just how difficult it can be planning a race strategy, given Sky's immense talent.

""On the day of La Pierre-Saint-Martin [Stage 10 of the 2015 Tour], Sky's strength was clear,"" Quintana said. ""I set my team to work from midstage to pull because I wanted the race to be very fast because it was very hot and it was the first day of climbing in the Tour. I thought people would pay the price, and that is what happened. The only thing was that the Sky riders, and Froome in particular, were enormously superior to all of us.""

Some observers have wondered whether Movistar waited too long to be aggressive in last year's Tour, but Quintana said trying to strike from afar at every opportunity is easier said than done.

""Even attacking from a distance, they are always going to cover you, so it is not so easy to attack,"" he said. ""And then, trying to make up lost time, you can lose three times the time you want to make up.""

Still, Quintana has proven that he has a special talent for racing over the course of three weeks, as he has gradually worked his way up the leaderboard in all three of his grand tour podium performances. If he's going to defeat the likes of Froome, Tinkoff's Alberto Contador and Astana's Fabio Aru in July, Quintana knows he'll have to rely on his special ability to thrive over 21 days on the bike.

""It's an ally that accompanies me, and I hope it's always there."" Quintana said of the length of the grand tours. ""In the races that I have done, like the [2014] Giro d'Italia that I won, [the length] was in my favor.""

Until July, Quintana will focus on his preparation through a carefully selected assembly of prep races. So far, Quintana's buildup certainly appears to be on track, given his third-place GC finish at the Tour de San Luis, a feat he pulled off despite putting in plenty of effort to help his younger brother and teammate Dayer nab the overall title.

The next big target on Quintana's calendar is the Volta a Catalunya, where Quintana has a bit of unfinished business, in late March. He has performed well there in the past but has never landed on the GC podium.

""I have always liked the Volta a Catalunya,"" Quintana said. ""Something has always happened. I've lost my place on the podium on the last day, and I'd like to try again. It's a race I like very much. I've also got a very nice stage win that I remember there. Why not try again?""

The race was also the setting of a revelatory moment between Quintana and Contador in 2011. Having taken up competitive cycling relatively late in his youth, the Colombian said he never imagined he might one day drop Contador in the mountains at the Tour, but Contador appears to have seen it coming.

""In the Volta a Catalunya in 2011, I was with him, and in a private moment, he told me that one day I would be alongside him, attacking him and competing with riders like him,"" Quintana said.

Quintana has now bettered Contador twice at the Tour de France, and at the moment, the bookmakers are giving Quintana -- not two-time winner Contador -- the best odds to unseat Froome as Tour champion this summer.",[]
espn.com,,Can 49ers NT Ian Williams maintain his ascent without Jim Tomsula?,"['Michael Rothstein', 'Paul Gutierrez']","SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- While continuity is key in any rebuilding situation, quality continuity is paramount.

The San Francisco 49ers re-signing nose tackle Ian Williams to a five-year deal falls into that latter category. The move can't be made official until 4 p.m. ET Wednesday when the new league year begins.

Williams, who does not turn 27 until Aug. 31, is coming off the finest season of his five-year career. Staying healthy had a lot to do with it, too.

In 2015, the 6-foot-1, 305-pound Williams started and played in 16 games for the first time and had a career-high 65 tackles with a sack of the Cincinnati Bengals' AJ McCarron. Williams also forced a fumble, recovered a fumble, had a pass defensed and blocked a kick.

Question 1, then, is can Williams stay healthy? Because, as the undrafted free agent out of Notre Dame would attest, injuries derailed promising starts before as he only played in four games combined his first two seasons. A broken ankle in Week 2 of the 2013 season ended things that year as did a broken leg in Week 9 of the 2014 season.

Question 1A, then, is this: Can he replicate his ascent without Jim Tomsula on staff?

Sure, we all know Tomsula did not exactly pan out as a head coach last season, but he is considered one of the best D-line coaches in the business. And Williams playing for someone besides his mentor will be new territory.

Williams is already respected in the locker room, as he was voted one of nine team captains by teammates last season despite only having nine career starts at the time.

That number will go up now as he teams with the likes of Glenn Dorsey, returning from injury, and promising Mike Purcell at the point of attack in the Niners' 3-4 defense.",[]

espn.com,,Conor McGregor vs. Nate Diaz,['Brett Okamoto'],"UFC 196 goes down this weekend inside MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas. The main event won't be what we expected, but then, that's par for the course when featherweight champion Conor McGregor is involved.

Originally scheduled to challenge Rafael dos Anjos for his lightweight championship, McGregor will instead face Nate Diaz in a non-title welterweight bout. Dos Anjos' decision to withdraw because of a broken foot marks the fourth time in eight UFC appearances that McGregor's opponent has pulled out. Diaz took the fight on 11 days' notice.

The pay-per-view will still showcase a UFC title fight, however, as bantamweight Holly Holm seeks her first defense against Miesha Tate. Let's break down the top two fights and predict other key matchups. Don't agree? Let me know (nicely, of course) on Twitter: @bokamotoESPN.

Main event

Conor McGregor (19-2) vs. Nate Diaz (18-10)

Welterweights

Odds: McGregor -420; Diaz +375

Mixed martial arts is difficult. Mixed martial arts on short notice is very difficult. Mixed martial arts on short notice, against Conor McGregor? Near impossible.

We discussed this last time, back in July when Jose Aldo withdrew from a title fight against McGregor at the last minute and Chad Mendes took his place. Mendes wasn't in fighting shape and it showed. McGregor is a busy unorthodox foe who relentlessly targets the body. That's a lethal combination to go up against if you're not in peak condition.

UFC 196: McGregor vs. Diaz Where: MGM Grand, Las Vegas

When: Saturday

TV: PPV, 10 p.m. ET

Stylistically, the thing about Diaz is that for each thing he does well, there's a corresponding hole in his technique. He's as flawed as he is brilliant, in other words. His volume can eat another man alive, but he doesn't have superb cage-cutting skill and he leans heavy on that lead leg, which leaves him vulnerable to kicks. He's good from the clinch -- knees, trips, occasional throws -- and his jiu-jitsu is slick, but he has been physically overmatched in the past by opponents with strong wrestling.

Diaz will be the biggest opponent McGregor has ever fought in the UFC. That said, Diaz might not be the hardest puncher. It's all volume with him. He attacks with the jab or that wide, slapping right hook. He's clever with the straight left and can vary its timing, but he has a low knockdown rate. Even when he knocked out Gray Maynard in 2013, Maynard never even went down in that fight.

It's worth talking about Diaz's lack of home run power in this matchup. McGregor can play the role of counter striker and aggressor equally well. He's willing to take a punch, which should be dangerous fighting at 170 pounds, but he's not the flat-footed type who will find himself consistently on the end of Diaz's punches. Couple of times in an exchange? Sure, McGregor could get hit. Consistently walked down over the course of a 25-minute fight? It would have been interesting to see if dos Anjos, a phenomenal aggressor with good wrestling skills, could have accomplished that. Diaz on short notice? Not likely.

Unless the size difference truly throws McGregor off, this looks like his fight. Diaz by submission is probably Stockton, California's greatest hope. If he's able to tie McGregor up into a clinch and get him to the floor, he has a far better shot of finishing the fight than short-notice Mendes did. As long as the fight stays standing, though, there's a chance McGregor makes this look pretty easy. His striking simply has more layers and he'll be the much faster man. Diaz is fond of the counter right hook when he's forced backwards. Keep an eye on that in this one, as it might open the door for McGregor's patented left.

PREDICTION: McGregor via second-round TKO.

Heather Watson is through to the Abierto Monterrey Afirme semifinals after a stunning victory against former world No.1 Caroline Wozniacki.

The British No.2, who has dropped to 84th in the rankings after a poor start to the year, produced a dominant display to beat the second seed 7-5, 6-4.

But British No.1 Johanna Konta will not join Watson in the last four after she lost in three sets to Belgium's Kirsten Flipkens.

Watson's clash with Wozniacki remained on serve for the first 10 games before the Brit broke and then served out the set.

Wozniacki broke early in the second but Watson hit back immediately, then picked up another game in the fifth before going on to serve out the match.

Konta earlier was beaten by world No.73 Flipkens in just over two hours.

The fourth seed fought back from the brink of defeat to take the second set but was blown away in the decider to lose 6-3, 6-7(2), 6-1.

Konta trailed 5-4 in the second but broke serve before easing through the tie-break. But Flipkens responded in style in the third set, racing into a 5-0 lead and securing victory with a comfortable hold of service.",[]

Four teams -- Team SoloMid, SK Telecom T1, Fnatic and Royal Never Give Up -- received direct invites to the IEM classic while four other clubs -- Counter Logic Gaming, Origen, ESC Ever and Qiao Gu -- were invited due to their high ranking in the last IEM event.

The first match will kick off with Team SoloMid squaring off against ESC Ever at 3:30 p.m. PST on March 4. For the rest of the schedule, feel free to click here.

Group A

ESC Ever (Korea)

Ever posted a dominant performance at the last IEM event it attended, but don't expect similar results this time around. The team lost star players Hyeong-gi ""Police"" Park and Ha-woon ""Athena"" Kang, and has not been the same since. Ever has performed well in Challengers Korea, but this was expected after its domination in the KeSPA Cup. It is unlikely the team will advance past the group stage portion of the event without a surprising win in its first match of the tournament against Team SoloMid, as the loss of talent and level of competition may be too much to overcome on this international stage.

Royal Never Give Up (China)

Royal is one of the more interesting teams coming into this event. The Chinese team has had some success this year, starting the LPL 4-0, but started to decline as other teams have come to form. The most notable thing about Royal is its utilization of a 10-man roster. Unlike most teams who possess a five-plus member roster, Royal constantly rotates its players to use each and every one of them.

The team's success depends primarily on Li ""Xiaohu"" Yuan-Hao, who has helped lead Royal to a tied first place standing in its group in the Legends Pro League. Despite this, the Chinese squad seems to have weaker shot-calling than other teams, which could prove to be problematic in an international setting where split-second decisions are crucial to a win. However, considering recent performances, expect this team to easily make it out of the Group Stage portion of the event and show up big during the playoff run.

Origen (Europe)

Origen has had a disappointing split, to say the least, after its amazing debut last season. Expectations were extremely high as this split started, considering the team's success in the recent World Championship, which ended in a memorable run to the semifinals before losing to eventual World Champions, SK Telecom T1.

Origen certainly hasn't been able to live up to those lofty expectations, as it has seemingly collapsed after coach Tadayoshi ""Hermit"" Littleton opted to move to North America and take over for NRG eSports. Since then, Origen has been riddled with inconsistency, barely maintaining an even 7-7 record in the league it was favored to win. A lack of cohesion almost certainly seals its fate in the tournament, as the squad faces Chinese powerhouse Royal Never Give Up early in the proceedings. Origen is unlikely to be able to advance unless it makes drastic improvements in the weeks prior to the tournament.

Team SoloMid (North America)

Despite racking up more wins than losses, Team SoloMid has seemingly lost its identity, and it has happened at one of the worst possible times. The team placed third/fourth at the last IEM event, but has since replaced its support with the veteran Bora ""Yell0wStar"" Kim.

Since his addition, the path has been rather rocky, as the team currently sits in fourth place during the spring split. However, TSM's record seemingly masks its poor play as of late, as a loss to Team Dignitas and an utter demolition by NRG has the team reeling. TSM is lacking synergy; each player has different ideas during the game, which shows through their play.

TSM's chances to advance far in the tournament seem slim, but it was able to show up last IEM World Championship. In addition, the team has an easier first-round opponent in Ever. Considering Group A seems to be the weaker of the two groups, TSM could have a shot to squeak into the playoff portion of the event. After that, anything can happen.

Will Fnatic celebrate victory at the IEM World Championships, or will the team continue its disappointing play on this international stage? Courtesy of Riot

Group B

SK Telecom T1 (KR)

The current world champions do not seem as strong as they used to be. After losing top lane starter Jang ""Marin"" Gyeong-Hwan to LGD during the offseason, (and rotational mid laner Lee ""Easyhoon"" Ji-hoon) SK Telecom T1 has lacked its former domination. The team on paper is strong, but is not living up to the hype, remaining in the middle of the LCK pack currently. While some of its losses have been close, SKT has also fallen to the likes of Afreeca, a result normally thought to be impossible.

This slump may affect SKT against the likes of Qiao Gu and Royal Never Give Up, but don't anticipate the Korean team having a problem against the Western teams that are mired in their own slumps. If anything, SKT are still favored to storm into the playoffs, and not doing so would be a major surprise.

Counter Logic Gaming (NA)

Counter Logic Gaming has been innovating in North America a little bit, most recently bringing out a top lane Pantheon in its victory over Renegades and Udyr when they took down the unbeaten Immortals. Despite the loss of star ADC Yiliang ""Doublelift"" Peng, Trevor ""Stixxay"" Hayes has been able to adequately fill his shoes and bring the team success, ranking currently behind Immortals in the NA LCS standings.

The team looks stronger than its counterparts from the West, but the question remains: How will CLG show up against international competition? Whether or not it will be able to rotate around its opponents for a victory is up in the air, and it will be a true test of strength as the North American squad will face world champions SKT in its first match of the tournament.

Fnatic (EU)

After a dominant summer split, Fnatic has seemed lost after the likes of Heo ""Huni"" Seung-hoon, Kim ""Reignover"" Yeu-jin, and Yell0wStar all left for North America. After trying Lewis ""Noxiak"" Simon Felix as a replacement for its former superstar shot-caller, Fnatic was forced to make a change again, opting for rookie Johan ""Klaj"" Olsson to fill the previously vacant support position. The team's performance remains lackluster, as it dropped from a world semifinalist team to a middle-of-the-pack EU LCS team, recently losing a game against Splyce, dying 13 times and failing to pick up a single kill of its own.

With such an unimpressive performance in its home league as of late, it is unlikely that Fnatic will be able to shape up against international competition. An opening match against Qiao Gu, the tournament favorites, will be a tall order and anything shy of a miracle will result in a disappointing performance in this event.

Qiao Gu (CN)

Speaking of Qiao Gu, the Chinese team is considered the favorite to win the tournament and arguably holds the mantle for best team in the world. After coming into IEM Cologne with the expectation of a middle-of-the-road team, it was able to place second, falling 2-3 to ESC Ever in the finals. Since then, Qiao Gu has had a dominant run in the regular season of the LPL. The team currently sits alone atop the standings with an impressive 7-0 record, while the second-place team, Snake Esports, is down at 4-2.

Last split, Qiao Gu was equally as impressive, narrowly missing qualifying for Worlds. Its impressive team fighting was offset by the tendency to fall behind and rely on a good fight to turn the game in its favor. While Qiao Gu continues to resemble team-fighting gods, it has been able to initiate the battles to seize advantages in the game, not fight in order to maintain a slim chance at success. It's safe to say that anything short of a top two placement will be surprising for this team of superstars.",[]

@ESPNChiCubs what player has impressed you the most since joining the Cubs? #AskHeyward  Ahne Solo (@BrandonAhne) March 7, 2016





Jason Heyward: I wouldn't say there was one person right now, but over the years I've been impressed with (Anthony) Rizzo. As far as his journey and path to getting to where he is now, to see him with Chicago when the team wasn't doing great and now the team is doing well, and he's done his fair share to bring the best to the team and get them here.





@ESPNChiCubs still wanting to know if he liked my tie #AskHeyward pic.twitter.com/F4PPqrbkVt  Cody Freund (@codyfreund9) March 7, 2016





JH: Yeah, that's a cool tie. I like it.





Is Jason a fan of day games? What's his take on right filed at Wrigley? #AskHeyward  BaseballSeasonYet? (@Ckurzrn) March 7, 2016





JH: I love day games. Always have. Kind of feel like a warrior getting up after a night game to play. The body is going to let you know, but once you get to the field and get amped up it's an awesome feeling. As for Wrigley, nobody does day games better than Wrigley.





@ESPNChiCubs what workouts can I do to get forearms as big as yours? #AskHeyward  Dan Welter (@Dan_Welter) March 7, 2016





JH: I don't do a lot of lifting. More like workouts where you're grabbing stuff like a medicine ball, pushing and pulling. A lot of rope swings. It's kind of like baseball stuff instead of just lifting. You're going to need to react and respond quickly. That stuff is better than weights.





@ESPNChiCubs @JasonHeyward How much did getting your number from @Addison_Russell set you back? #AskHeyward  Mike_Honcho1127 (@MikeHoncho1127) March 4, 2016





JH: Ask him.





Addison Russell: He gave me a Gucci wallet and backpack. Also a Breitling watch. I'm good.





Who is more handsome Kyle Schwarber or David ""the grey wolf"" Ross? #AskHeyward @ESPNChiCubs  Dalton Wright (@CasualVern) March 7, 2016

JH: I'm a thin crust guy. Thin crust for sure.





#AskHeyward what are you looking forward to the most about living in Chicago?  Johnny (@Coach_mitch3) March 7, 2016





JH: The food, for sure. And being able to drive to the field every day and see the lake for 81 games. That's going to be pretty cool.





@ESPNChiCubs What vision did Theo lay out for you when you first met him? #AskHeyward  Austin Burklund (@AB1132) March 7, 2016





JH: Just that the team wants to win now and wants to win for a long time. And we want to become one of those teams established in baseball that expect the team to be in the playoffs every year.





@ESPNChiCubs Does the Cards/Cubs rivalry exist between players or is mostly just fans? Is being on the (right side) strange? #AskHeyward  Just Another Guy (@CubFan83) March 4, 2016





JH: One hundred percent, I mean 100 percent, it's the fans. When you talk about rivalries, as a baseball player, you would like to think there was some winning between both teams. Last year notwithstanding, right now it's lopsided. They have what we want as far as being established and going to the playoffs every year and winning championships. If we want a rivalry, I'd say we have some work to do.





@ESPNChiCubs @JasonHeyward What players did you grow up idolizing? #AskHeyward  Michael Imus (@MichaelAImus) March 4, 2016





JH: Ken Griffey Jr. and Derek Jeter, for obvious reasons. Great players and class guys.





@ESPNChiCubs @JasonHeyward was there ever a time during last season that you were thinking about being a cub? #AskHeyward  Chris (@G0CubsG0) March 4, 2016

espn.com,,Nathan Adrian sweeps sprints again at Arena Pro Swim Series,"['Johnette Howard', 'Espn Staff', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Adriana Terrazas', 'Bonnie D']","ORLANDO, Fla. -- Nathan Adrian is an emerging star in the Arena Pro Swim Series, but the 27-year-old is reluctant to accept any comparisons to Michael Phelps, the long-time king of U.S. swimming.

Adrian easily beat a star-studded field that included Phelps in the men's 100-meter freestyle to sweep the sprint events for the third straight meet in the series. He led wire-to-wire to finish at 48.05 with Italy's Luca Dotta second at 49.33 and Phelps, the 18-time gold medalist third at 49.57.

Adrian's time was the second fastest in the world this year.

""It always feels good to get your hand on the wall first, but at the end of the day, I want Michael (Phelps) to be part of the U.S. 400-meter relay team because we're going to be better with him,"" Adrian said.

Simone Manuel, who is redshirting this year at Stanford, took another step in an attempt to make her first Olympic team by beating gold medalists Allison Schmitt and Katie Ledecky to the wall in the women's 100-meter free.

Manuel, who was caught in the 50-meter event the night before, turned first against Schmitt and Ledecky, then held off the 2012 gold medalists in the final 20 meters to win in a time of 54.27. Schmitt was second at 54.56 and the fast-closing Ledecky took third at 54.67.

""Racing against great competitors like that is going to be very impactful for this year,"" Manuel said. ""The biggest thing for me is learning and progressing into what I want to achieve at Olympic Trials. I have a lot to look forward to as the year progresses.""

Stanford graduate Maya DiRado, picked up her third victory of the meet, rolling past the field in the final 50 meters to win the 200-meter individual medley in a time of 2:10.77. She also won the 200-meter butterfly and 400 IM earlier in the week.

Four-time Olympic gold medalist Missy Franklin won the closest race of the night, out-swimming Dominique Bouchard and Elizabeth Beisel in the final 25 meters to win the women's 200-meter backstroke in 2:08.77.

As always, however, the crowd and media attention centered on Phelps, who hopes to make the men's 400-meter relay team at Olympic qualifying this June. The 30-year-old swam in the outside lane in the 100-meter final and was seventh at the turn, but reeled most of the field back in the final 50 meters to finish third.

""I had it a little bit today, but my stroke really isn't where I want it to be,"" Phelps said. ""It's getting better, but it's just not great right now.""",[]

espn.com,,Seeking solutions for SKT T1's slump,"['James Obscurica', 'Tomi Lurppis', 'James Bates', 'Stephen Chiu', 'Tim Lee', 'Tyler Fionn', 'Chase Geddes', 'Timothy Lee']","It's unusual to be worried about a twice-over world champion team. Sure, after a title's taken, all sorts of things can happen. Rosters change, players retire or transfer elsewhere, and other teams start to rise up to the standards it set. It was probably too much to expect SKT T1 to repeat that frankly miraculous 2013-14 winter split, coming out of Worlds that year to thoroughly dominate the Korean circuit without dropping a game -- but, at the very least, we expected it to be a contender.

We weren't expecting it to be losing to the Afreeca Freecs.

People now speak of an even-season curse -- that just as SKT T1 was easily the best team in the world in 2013 and slumped in 2014, the current SKT T1 roster that dominated 2015 was ill-fated for this current season. But the idea of a curse is that something supernatural and out of its capability to address is behind its ill fortunes -- and that neatly preserves the players' reputations and absolves it of responsibility for the decline.

When the Dignitas Baron curse is discussed, or Liquid's perpetual fourth-place finish, it's shorthand for waving off a messy slog of communicative or internal dynamics issues -- hard to analyze and break down without getting into the messy and irresponsible business of amateur psychoanalysis. With SKT, though, there are some blatant statistical and gameplay factors that can explain why it's in the bottom half of the standings -- and at risk for failing to make playoffs.

Fact of the matter is: its entire jungle strategy needs to be rewritten. Again.

...maybe.

One small stumble for man...

The last time SKT jungler Bengi had a season like this, Kha'zix, Evelynn and Rengar were metagame-relevant picks, and the jungler was expected to be a significant portion of their team's overall damage output. He was unable to win on either Kha'zix or Rengar at the time (a flat 0 percent win rate for both in the regular season), and held a below-50 percent rate on Evelynn averaged across both splits -- in fact, he found it hard to break past more than three KDA total on anything but comfort picks like Lee Sin and Elise.

On Patch 6.2, where SKT T1's biggest losses this split's occurred, it was all about the carry junglers again -- this time with Nidalee, Graves and Rumble. Like with the 2014 jungle metagame, these were champions that prioritized clearspeed and damage output above anything else. Rather than frontline initiators or supportive crowd control ambushers like Rek'sai or Elise respectively, these were champions that wanted their teammates to back them up instead of the other way around, providing space and opportunity to lay out the bodybags on the opposing team.

Editor's Picks Team Liquid's Dardoch talks NA LCS junglers The rookie jungler for Team Liquid is having a good spring split, but how does he rate some of the competition?

That requires damage items, and damage items need farm. Bengi at an average of 3.71 CS per minute this split is only above substitute SKT jungler Blank and CJ Entus jungler Bubbling, making him the second-worst farmer in the LCK. And Blank, having played a meager handful of games, barely counts.

If not farm, then at least kills, right? If he's simply ganking constantly and picking up player bounties, a low farm score doesn't necessarily hurt too badly -- and to Bengi's credit, he's at the center of the table for overall KDA and nowhere near as badly off as SBENU Sonicboom's ironically named Flawless.

That said, Bengi's also near the bottom of the table for kill participation, being involved in just 67.3 percent of all of SKT T1's kills so far this spring -- it's not that he's been ganking or ambushing people. He's just mostly not been dying as much as less experienced junglers. But ""mostly not dying"" is just another way to euphemistically say ""being bloody useless.""

...one giant fall for the team

Bae ""Bengi"" Seong-woong has struggled recently for SK T1. Courtesy of Riot

Bengi isn't nearly the only weakness in the SKT T1 lineup -- bot laners Bang and Wolf are similarly suffering, statistically -- but the stark difference between on-meta and off-meta Bengi is notable, and seems more strongly correlated than any other factor for the team. For better or worse, not even Faker's quite as influential on the team's fortunes -- though given that Faker Plays Everything, odds are he wishes he was.

Bengi, however, has a very specific range of champions he plays well: supports and tanks. His 2015 season was defined by Jarvan, Rek'sai, and -- to his credit -- a much improved Evelynn. It also featured the occasional Vi, a rare Sejuani, and especially a legitimately threatening Nunu (wielder of a 28-point KDA across two summer games). These are all setup champions: they run up, lock down a target with crowd control and let their team handle the fight while shrugging off the damage levied at them. And that is exactly the opposite, stylistically, of Nidalee or Rumble.

The teams attempted to compensate for it by finding champions that sit midway between high-damage and high toughness, going with Graves and Udyr against Longzhu IM and Freecs. But even with their rapid clearspeed in his favor, there wasn't a single game in either set where Bengi's ever held a farm lead at any time, often falling 30 or more behind the opposing jungler.

That doesn't just hurt his itemization -- it often means he's too late for everything that happens in the game. When Faker was pushed up against Coco eight minutes into the LZIM set, both junglers knew that the fight was going to occur mid-map. But Bengi was a full five seconds behind Chaser -- too late to even see the artful combination of Frozen Tomb into Cocoon that permanently and fatally locked up Faker for first blood.

Against Freecs, it was somehow even worse. LirA's much faster and more efficient jungle pathing ran circles around Bengi and scooped up buffs at-will -- not entirely unexpected on Nidalee, as her last rework made her a brutally efficient player-versus-environment sort of champion, but the damage was further compounded by the deep warding and map control exerted by the carry jungler.

That vision disparity came back to haunt SKT T1 twice in game two, against a team that had no outstanding claim to being a match to a world champion. The first, at 18 minutes, was a Teleport play behind SKT's lines that ended up with a triple kill on LirA and a gold lead for the Freecs. The second, 32 minutes in, was herding as a work of art: SKT's retreat path was entirely visible, cut off at the right places by major threats to funnel it toward Baron Nashor, and concluded with a Glacial Fissure across all five players within a chokepoint just as Poppy rams in with Teleport again.

You don't get much better setups than that -- and especially not against a top team.

Getting back up

These repeat failures raise a dour question: Should Bengi be replaced? 6.3 and 6.4 is going to muddy those waters, as Gragas's re-entry into the metagame, and Lee Sin's recent prominence in other circuits, expands his pool of viable options with a couple of proven classics.

Doing so hews SKT closer toward the play style that won it championships, or basically Bengi acting as Faker's third Summoner Spell: Call Fire Support. And there's a reason why this works, beyond the simple fact that any team with Faker is going to naturally gravitate toward accentuating that strength. The most recent patches have also given rise to dedicated multi-AD Carry compositions, and Gragas's strong area-denial suite plays well into that, either knocking back fellow frontliners or keeping targets slowed down enough for the auto-attacks to pummel them back to respawn. Same, of course, can be said for Lee Sin with Dragon's Rage and Tempest/Cripple.

The real question is what it'll do when the metagame changes on it again. And to that, there's no clear answer.

SKT has only fielded Blank four times so far this spring, and from the scant few performances he's clearly trainee material -- still not prime-time ready. But among those games, we have Elise, Graves and Kindred: whatever else, the kid is clearly a carry-oriented jungler, and also signals that SKT T1 is clearly aware of the weaknesses in its lineup.

It makes sense for them to stick to the more veteran player for now -- again, Bengi might not be a carry jungler, but at least he isn't outright dying on the field. But if the team's entire fortune rests on whether or not playoff patches match its jungler's play style, then the clock may be ticking on Bengi's career. It might find itself in an AHQ situation, substituting a player depending on map-side to shield a champion pool limitation... or Blank's going to have to get really good, really fast.

It's going to be a rough season, either way.",[]

Millar, 39, was a prodigious talent and won the Tour de France prologue before turning to performance-enhancing drugs. He served a two-year ban from 2004 to 2006 after admitting to using blood-boosting agent EPO early in his career.

He returned to the sport a reformed character and won a stage of the 2012 Tour de France before competing at the London 2012 Olympics after the British Olympic Association bylaw banning those with doping convictions was quashed.

""Nurturing an anti-doping culture is at the heart of everything we do at British Cycling, and educating our young riders on the subject is a responsibility we take seriously,"" said British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton.

""Having someone of David's calibre on board to support us in this education process is invaluable; he is readily available to share his well-rounded experiences as a professional cyclist to the young riders who aspire to succeed in their careers.

""In addition to his mentor work, David brings with him a massive amount of training and tactical knowledge which will support the work of the coaches, and he's become a well-respected figure in cycling which will help us to open doors when it comes to fielding young talent into professional road teams.

""David will work with the squad on a voluntary basis until the end of the month with a view to subsequently joining the team in a more official capacity.""

Millar also won the 2010 Commonwealth Games time-trial gold medal for Scotland, after taking silver at the World Championships a few weeks earlier, and claimed stage wins in all three Grand Tours after returning to the professional peloton.",[]

Saturday at Washington, D.C.

Luis Ortiz KO6 Tony Thompson

Heavyweight

Records: Ortiz (25-0, 22 KOs); Thompson (40-7, 27 KOs)

Rafael's remarks: From the moment Ortiz knocked out contender Bryant Jennings in devastating fashion in the seventh round on Dec. 19, he immediately became the heavyweight division's bogeyman, a guy no top guys are interested in tangling with. He was a superb amateur on the famed Cuban national team and he's a fast southpaw with crushing power who does not generate enormous money. For all of those reasons, getting a top big man to set foot in the ring with him is and will be a nightmare for Golden Boy Promotions.

""You still haven't seen the best of me, you have not seen the best of 'King Kong.' I am ready for anyone in the ring any time."" Luis Ortiz

Golden Boy ran through several opponents who turned down the opportunity to headline this HBO card. After Alexander Dimitrenko accepted, he tried to get more money that was not available and pulled out. So on about a month's notice, Thompson, the 44-year-old two-time former world title challenger (twice knocked out by Wladimir Klitschko), took the fight. Thompson has rarely turned down an opportunity and quickly accepted the fight with the bonus being that it was already set to take place in his hometown of Washington, D.C., where he had never fought in 17 years as a pro.

Thompson gave it his best effort but he was not in top shape, was very slow and was a sitting duck for Ortiz's blaster of a left hand. The 6-foot-4, 242-pound Ortiz, whose interim world title was not at stake because the organization understandably declined to sanction Thompson as a challenger, scored three knockdowns in the fight between southpaws.

Ortiz, who defected and fights out of Miami, nearly ended the fight in the first round when he knocked Thompson down hard with an overhand left to the head. The 6-5, 264-pound Thompson did not want to be embarrassed in front of his home crowd and showed heart to stay in the fight. But he had little to offer and went down for the second time from an identical overhand left as the third round ended.

In the sixth round, ""The Real King Kong"" once again landed a powerful overhand left and Thompson went down again. This time he was done and referee Malik Waleed counted him out at 2 minutes, 29 seconds as Thompson was trying to get up. It was another devastating performance from Ortiz and will do nothing to convince other top opponents to fight him.

Overall, he landed Ortiz landed 88 of 250 punches (35 percent) while Thompson connected on 43 of 221 punches (19 percent), according to CompuBox punch statistics.

As they should have, two judges had Ortiz winning every round but one judge, Washington's Lloyd Scaife, had a disgraceful hometown card on which he had the audacity to give Thompson two rounds in a fight that was pure Ortiz domination from start to finish.

Golden Boy hopes that Ortiz will return May 7 to fight on the Canelo Alvarez-Amir Khan HBO PPV undercard against Russian mandatory challenger Alexander Ustinov (33-1, 24 KOs). The fight is due by June 19.

Jessie Vargas TKO9 Sadam Ali

Wins a vacant welterweight title

Records: Vargas (27-1, 10 KOs); Ali (22-1, 13 KOs)

Rafael's remarks: In perhaps the best performance of his career, Vargas, 26, a former junior welterweight titlist from Las Vegas, scored a definitive victory to claim his second world title. He and Ali, a 27-year-old 2008 U.S. Olympian from Brooklyn, New York, met for the 147-pound world title recently vacated by Timothy Bradley Jr., who elected to accept a big-money third meeting with Manny Pacquiao on April 9 rather than face Ali, the mandatory challenger.

Going into the fight, it was universally viewed as an even fight that could be a good one, and that is exactly what it turned out to be. It was competitive and entertaining as both fighters had their moments in the fast-paced fight.

In the end, however, it was Vargas, who landed more punches, was more accurate and who had an answer whenever Ali would land, who rose to the occasion. He fought a very disciplined fight and gave credit for the win to the game plan and motivation given to him by Dewey Cooper, his new trainer.

Vargas came into the fight with a chip on his shoulder still ticked off by how his last fight in June ended, a unanimous decision loss challenging Bradley for the belt. He came close to stopping Bradley in the final seconds of the bout, but felt as though he was robbed of the chance to finish him when referee Pat Russell mistook the clapper signaling 10 seconds left in the round as the final bell and stopped the fight with about seven seconds left. Vargas vowed he would not wait around to get going again and he did lived up to that promise against Ali, whom he knocked down twice.

Ali's right eye began to swell in the action-packed fourth round. Ali was having a very good eighth round when Vargas cracked him with a clean overhand right that crumpled him near the ropes as the round was coming to an end. Vargas continued to attack in the ninth round, dropping him with a right hand midway through it and then finishing him when he badly rocked him with another right hand and referee Kenny Chevalier intervened at 2 minutes, 9 seconds.

According to CompuBox punch statistics, Vargas landed 159 of 429 punches (37 percent) and Ali landed 118 of 408 blows (29 percent). But Vargas, ahead on all three scorecards going into the ninth round, closed the show in that round by landing 21 of 35 power punches.

With the victory in hand and the belt around his waist, Vargas called for a rematch with Bradley regardless of the outcome of his third meeting with Pacquiao. Top Rank promoter said he would like to match Vargas with the April 9 winner. Whatever happens, Vargas, with such a good and crowd-pleasing performance, put himself in position for big business.

Oscar Escandon KO7 Robinson Castellanos

Wins a vacant interim featherweight title

Records: Escandon (25-2, 17 KOs); Castellanos (21-11, 13 KOs)

Rafael's remarks: In November, titleholder Gary Russell Jr. was scheduled to face Escandon in a voluntary defense before he was supposed to face mandatory challenger Castellanos. But Russell suffered a cut in training and the fight with Escandon was canceled. With Russell sidelined, Castellanos and Escandon were approved to fight each other for the interim belt with Russell mandated to fight the winner later this year.

Castellanos, 33, of Mexico, had scored two upsets in row -- a fifth-round knockout of then-undefeated Ronny Rios in October 2014 and a lopsided decision against Rocky Juarez in January 2015 -- to earn the mandatory shot against Russell. But Castellanos could not make it three big wins in a row as the much-shorter Escandon, 31, a 2004 Colombian Olympian, who was moving up in weight, pressured him nonstop, banged him to the body and outfought him.

Castellanos' best moment came in the second round when he dropped Escandon with a hard jab-right hand combination that sent him to his backside. Escandon, however, did not appear hurt, got up quickly and took over the fight.

He steadily broke Castellanos down, had him in trouble in the fifth round (during which Castellanos suffered a bad cut over his left eye) and then dropped him with a clean right uppercut in the seventh round. Castellanos went down to a knee and referee Frank Garza counted him out at 2 minutes, 59 seconds. It was a big win for Escandon, who has yet to meet his baby daughter, who was born three weeks ago while he was in training camp.

Saturday at Bethlehem, Pa.

Julian ""J Rock"" Williams TKO7 Marcello Matano

Junior middleweight - Title eliminator

Scores: 116-112 (twice) Frampton, 115-113 Quigg

Records: Williams (22-0-1, 14 KOs); Matano (16-2, 15 KOs)

Rafael's remarks: Williams, 25, of Philadelphia, is probably right when he says that no top 154-pounder is going to fight him unless he has to. Now, one will. Williams beat and battered Matano -- who should have never been anywhere near a world title elimination fight based on his overwhelmingly soft opposition -- in a one-sided fight that headlined a Showtime-televised tripleheader to become the mandatory challenger to titleholder Jermall Charlo (23-0, 18 KOs). It is a fight that should be a snap to make since they are both with manager Al Haymon.

Matano, 29, of Italy, who was fighting outside of his home country for the first time, saw a four-fight winning streak end in violent fashion. He showed toughness but Williams took his time and broke him down, especially with a good body attack.

Williams was in total command when he hurt Matano with a left hook and a right hand in the seventh round. Williams then pounded a defenseless Matano across the ring with a series of big punches until referee Gary Rosato waved off the fight at 2 minutes, 24 seconds. After the fight Williams made his case for a significant fight and for Charlo to face him.

""Maybe guys will come out from under the rock and get some of this West Philly work,"" William said. ""Jermall has been watching my performances. Him and his (twin) brother (Jermell) know exactly who I am. He needs to fight or vacate now. He needs to step up, but he's already laying his groundwork and making excuses. Step up and fight me. It's two of the best junior middleweights in the world. It's about greatness. I want to be great. All of you turkeys at 154 pounds, let's fight.""

Avtandil Khurtsidze TKO10 Antoine Douglas

Middleweight

Records: Khurtsidze (32-2-2, 21 KOs); Douglas (19-1-1, 13 KOs)

Rafael's remarks: Fast-rising contender Douglas, 23, of Burke, Virginia, was supposed to take on 42-year-old former titleholder Sam Soliman (44-13, 18 KOs), whose best days are way behind him. But Soliman suffered a knee injury and pulled out and Khurtsidze, a superior opponent, took the fight on less than three weeks' notice. It proved to be a very bad decision by Douglas' team to accept him as the opponent. Khurtsidze, 36, a native of Georgia (the former Soviet Republic) who fights out of Brooklyn, New York, extended his winning streak to nine fights in a row with a bruising performance in which he doled out such extensive punishment to Douglas that his career may be altered forever.

The 5-foot-4 Khurtsidze, who has not lost since a decision to Hassan N'Dam in an interim world title bout in 2010, bulled forward from the start laid a beating on Douglas, who got no assistance from his cornermen, who should be ashamed of themselves for not protecting their fighter and stopping the fight sooner.

Khurtsidze knocked Douglas down for the first time in his career with a left hand early in the third round, sending him face first through the ropes. Douglas rallied to win the fourth and fifth rounds in the highly entertaining bout before Khurtsidze opened the seventh with a huge left hand that floored Douglas again. A fading Douglas took enormous punishment in the 10th round as Khurtsidze blasted away until referee Benjy Esteves finally stopped it at 33 seconds with Douglas defenseless against the ropes.

""I knew he was going to get tired,"" Khurtsidze said. ""I felt like I was going to catch him. He's a good fighter, but he's not strong. I knew he was going to be hungry. But I also knew that I was going to beat him. It was short notice but I did everything I could in the time we had. I stayed in the gym and stayed sharp. Whoever they put in front me, I'm ready for them. I love fighting. I'll fight anybody.""

Douglas, who spent the night in the hospital for observation, said, ""I feel OK. He definitely dictated. He definitely had a better day today. It's not discouraging, we just weren't able to execute. Naturally, I'm crushed. It's back to the drawing board.""

Tony Harrison TKO6 Fernando Guerrero

Middleweight

Records: Harrison (23-1, 19 KOs); Guerrero (28-4, 20 KOs)

Rafael's remarks: Harrison, 25, of Detroit, was viewed by many as a can't-miss prospect until he ran into Willie Nelson last July and was upset in a ninth-round knockout. Harrison rebounded in October for a one-sided decision against Cecil McCalla and followed with this dominant knockout victory against Guerrero, a 29-year-old southpaw from Salisbury, Maryland.

The first round illustrated how the fight unfolded as Harrison landed 10 of 38 punches, according to CompuBox statistics, while Guerrero pulled the rare feat of landing none of his 11 shots. Things did not get much better for him. Harrison pounded him in the second round with a series of heavy shots before knocking him down face first with a right hand just before the bell ended the round. Guerrero had a couple decent moments in the fourth and fifth rounds but Harrison was never in any trouble and then he put Guerrero away in the sixth round with two more knockdowns. A left hand dropped Guerrero to his rear end in a corner and when the fight resumed he was so wobbly that he staggered near another corner across the ring before Harrison nailed him with one right hand. Guerrero went down again in that corner and referee Gary Rosato waved off the fight at 1 minute, 54 seconds.

Overall, Harrison landed 100 of 314 punches (35 percent) and Guerrero connected on just 51 of 188 (27 percent). Guerrero, who was knocked out by then-middleweight titlist Peter Quillin in the seventh round of a 2013 title shot, dropped to 3-3 in his last six, including that loss. All of his defeats have been by knockout and it does not look like he has anywhere left to go at this point. Harrison seems back on track after his defeat and said he wants a rematch with Nelson.

Also on the card, blue chip middleweight prospect Ievgen Khytrov (13-0, 11 KOs), 27, a 2012 Ukrainian Olympian who fights out of Brooklyn, New York, won a unanimous decision against Kenneth McNeil (9-2, 6 KOs), 25, of Birmingham, Alabama, on scores of 99-90, 97-92 and 97-92.

Saturday at Grozny, Russia

Lucas Browne TKO10 Ruslan Chagaev

Wins a heavyweight title

Records: Browne (24-0, 21 KOs); Chagaev (34-3-1, 21 KOs)

Rafael's remarks: When Tyson Fury outpointed Wladimir Klitschko in a big upset in November he became the legitimate heavyweight champion. Period. However, the WBA has this nasty habit -- one it claims it is trying to break -- of having three titleholders in the same weight class with a ""super,"" ""regular"" and interim titleholder. Chagaev has been the secondary so-called ""regular"" titleholder since 2014 and was making his second defense against mandatory challenger Browne.

Browne, 36, showed enormous heart to rally for the biggest win of his career as he became the first Australian to win a heavyweight title. The fight was a bit messy, but Chagaev, a 37-year-old southpaw from Uzbekistan, dropped Browne hard with a straight left hand with 35 seconds left in the sixth round. Bleeding from his left eye and on wobbly legs, Chagaev blasted Browne with another left hand that sent him bouncing off the ropes moments later. Browne was in terrible shape as the round ended and was lucky to make to the bell. Browne got himself together and actually had a pretty good seventh round.

In the 10th round, Browne, cut over his left eye and on his forehead, landed a flush right hand on Chagaev's chin, which sent him staggering backward and down with a minute to go. Chagaev walked into the punch that he never saw and was badly hurt. He beat the count but was in rough shape. Browne went right after him and teed off. He landed around 18 unanswered shots -- mostly right hands -- as Chagaev staggered along the ropes until referee Stanley Christodoulou finally stopped it at 2 minutes, 27 seconds. He was definitely a few punches too late on the stoppage.

With the upset secured, Browne next is obligated to face Fres Oquendo by June in one of the bouts that is part of a WBA tournament designed to whittle its titleholders down to only one.

""I'm so proud to have won this title for Australia,"" Browne said. ""Obviously, I can improve but I showed that my heart and power can never be questioned. I'm thrilled to have made history. It was a big step up, but I got the win and I thank everyone for the support. Words can't describe how I feel right now.""

Saturday at Mexico City

Antonio Margarito W10 Jorge Paez Jr.

Junior middleweight

Scores: 97-93, 96-93, 95-94

Records: Margarito (39-8, 27 KOs); Paez Jr. (39-8-2, 23 KOs)

Rafael's remarks: More than four years after former welterweight world titleholder Margarito had his surgically repaired right eye turned into hamburger in a 10th-round knockout loss to then-junior middleweight titleholder Miguel Cotto in their hostility-filled December 2011 rematch and then retired, he returned to the ring.

Mexico's Margarito, who turns 38 next week, looked extremely rusty and slow against Paez, 28, of Mexico, who was moving up in weight as he lost his second fight in a row and for the third time in his last four bouts. Despite Paez's limitations he gave Margarito a lot of problems in this high-contact slugfest. Margarito's right eye still looks horrible and misshapen, he's even slower now than he was during his prime and he did not seem to have a lot of steam on punches, but he stood in the center of the ring and traded with Paez for most of the fight.

The crowd of around 10,000 loved the action and grew even louder in the sixth round, when Paez connected with a pair of hard right hands and a left to knock Margarito down hard. Margarito showed resilience by beating the count. He was very wobbly as Paez tried to finish him but Margarito dug deep and fought back hard in some of the most intense exchanges of the brawl. Margarito recovered well from the knockdown and finished the fight strongly, even nearly stopping Paez in the final round.

Margarito, still viewed as an outcast by many for attempting to fight Shane Mosley in a 2009 welterweight title fight with hand wraps that contained elements of plaster of Paris (and having his license revoked for it), got the win over Paez but what is the point of continuing his career? Paez is a journeyman and nearly knocked him out. A good opponent probably would destroy Margarito, whose eye was first badly injured in a lopsided loss to Manny Pacquiao in 2011, after which he had surgery. The notion of Margarito getting a big fight is unseemly.

Giovanni Delgado W10 Cesar Juarez

Featherweight

Scores: 96-95, 96-93 Delgado, 95-94 Juarez

Records: Delgado (16-4, 9 KOs); Juarez (17-5, 13 KOs)

Rafael's remarks: Delgado, 24, of Mexico, the third opponent in about 10 days took the fight on a couple of days' notice and pulled the upset. He came into the bout having lost two in a row and three of his last four bouts. Juarez, 24, of Mexico, was coming off a decision loss in a sensational brawl with Nonito Donaire for a vacant junior featherweight world title fight on Dec. 11. Perhaps he returned to action to quickly after that brutal fight. Whatever it was, he did not have the same kind of spirit that he had in the title bout, and Delgado got off first throughout the solid scrap. Delgado stayed busy round in and round out and did enough to get the close decision.

Friday at Tampa

Orlando Cruz W10 Romulo Koasicha

Junior lightweight

Scores: 100-87, 99-88 (twice)

Records: Cruz (23-4-1, 11 KOs); Koasicha (25-6, 15 KOs)

Rafael's remarks: Cruz, 34, of Puerto Rico, who came out as boxing's only openly gay fighter in 2012, won his third bout in a row since back-to-back losses, including by seventh-round knockout to Orlando Salido for a vacant featherweight world title in October 2013. Cruz dominated Koasicha in the Telemundo-televised main event, scoring three knockdown en route to the victory.

Cruz floored Koasicha twice in the sixth round, first with a left hand that left Koasicha with a bloody nose, and then with a combination later in the round. In the 10th round, Cruz dropped him again under heavy pressure. It was as one-sided a fight as there could be without a knockout.

Koasicha, 24, of Mexico, lost his second fight in a row, having been previously knocked out in the 10th round in November challenging featherweight world titleholder Vasyl Lomachenko.

Friday at Kyoto, Japan

Shinsuke Yamanaka W12 Liborio Solis

Retains a bantamweight title

Scores: 117-107 (three times)

Records: Yamanaka (25-0-2, 17 KOs); Solis (23-4-1, 10 KOs)

Rafael's remarks: Yamanaka, a 33-year-old Japanese southpaw, survived two knockdowns in the third round but also knocked down former junior bantamweight titleholder Solis, 33, of Venezuela, twice en route to the victory. Yamanaka, who retained his title for the 10th time, scored his knockdowns in the second round (on a right hook) and ninth round (left hand). Solis' right hand caused Yamanaka to hit the deck twice in the third. Yamanaka got back in the fight, and because open scoring was used, he knew he was ahead 77-72 on all three scorecards following the eighth round.

Ganigan Lopez W12 Yu Kimura

Wins a junior flyweight title

Scores: 119-109, 118-110, 114-114

Records: Lopez (27-6, 17 KOs); Kimura (18-3-1, 3 KOs)

Rafael's remarks: Lopez, a 34-year-old southpaw from Mexico, lost his first shot at a world title when then-junior flyweight titlist Pedro Guevara outpointed him in July. Two fights later, Lopez got another shot and pulled the upset against Kimura, 32, of Japan, who was making his first defense after having taken the belt from Guevara by split decision in November. It was a relatively boring fight as neither fighter had much to show on offense but Lopez, a little sharper, got the job done in fairly dominant fashion.

Wednesday at Chonburi, Thailand

Wanheng Menayothin TKO5 Go Odaira

Retains a strawweight title

Records: Menayothin (41-0, 16 KOs); Odaira (12-5-3, 1 KO)

Rafael's remarks: Menayothin, 30, of Thailand, retained his 105-pound world title for the fourth time as he constantly pressured Odaira, a 31-year-old southpaw from Japan, who was fighting for the first time in one year. Menayothin dropped him in the third round with a right hand and took a shellacking the rest of the way as he lost his second strawweight world title bout in his last three bouts. In the fifth round, Menayothin landed a pair of uppercuts that had him in big trouble before he went down after taking a few more shots. Referee Raymond Chang stopped the bout at 2 minutes without bothering to count.",[]

espn.com,,PGA Championship winner Jason Day talks exclusively to ESPN's Sam Bruce,"['Ben Fawkes', 'Gordon Simpson', 'Pa Sport', 'Espn Staff', 'Jason Sobel', 'Bob Harig', 'Michael Collins', 'Sam Bruce']","With five wins, a first major triumph, the birth of his second child and a bout of vertigo, you'd think Jason Day would reflect on 2015 with adjectives like ""awesome"" or ""eventful"". But as the golfing superstar recalled what was arguably the standout Australian sporting season of 2015, it's education, rather than adulation, that comes to mind.

""Learning: that word would be learning,"" Day told ESPN. ""It was more of a learning year for me.

""Obviously going into that year I never really expected to have the second half of the season pan out the way it did and I think I really learnt to believe and trust in my abilities and know that I am one of the best players in the world.

""And to be able to finally get over that hurdle of becoming a major championship winner and then also No.1 in the world for a brief period there gave me a lot of confidence but belief [too]. It was just, I learnt to get back into that habit of wanting to really buckle down and try to challenge the top guys for their spots and try and win as much as possible.""

Andrew Redington/Getty Images

Day's finish to the year, which saw him claim four victories in the space of two months, followed a bout of vertigo that saw him collapse on course mid-round at the US Open. For many players, it would have been an easy excuse to opt out of golf in search of a full recovery. Day just went and claimed the world No.1 ranking instead.

""Yeah it's just something that you kind of ... vertigo, it's a hard thing to kind of explain,"" he said. ""It's like you're spinning in a chair and then you try and get up and you try and walk and it's really difficult because you're just so dizzy.

""Any sport would be hard to play, even just living would be hard to function while you're dizzy. I mean golf is one of those sports where you need to see the ball, it's very static and you're trying to swing, and you use pretty much all your body parts to get the ball from A to B.

""So it can be very difficult to play competitive golf but, off course, if it didn't happen in tournament week I'd be sitting there in bed for two days straight just laying down and trying not to move because it's really difficult to function.""

""I really thought my first major was going to be the Open Championship and unfortunately I left a putt short."" Jason Day

Just four weeks later Day fronted at St Andrews for the Open Championship. Three strong rounds put him right in contention going into the final day, only for a missed putt at the 72nd hole to revive memories of his late Masters collapse of 2013.

Again, it could have ushered in an abrupt end to Day's season. But just seven days later he dropped a 21-foot bomb to claim victory at the RBC Canadian Open - the putt thundering into the back of the cup to wipe away memories of his gentle roll in Scotland. The rest of the season sorted itself.

Cliff Hawkins/Getty Images

""Yeah, you know what, it all kind of happened, and I explained this last year, it all kind of happened to me at the end of the British Open where I played really good golf,"" Day told ESPN.

""I only made three bogies, they were all in the second round, but when I went over there I just felt really calm with myself, found this inner peace, and it kind of just felt like it was my time - like it was meant to be.

""I really thought my first major was going to be the Open Championship and unfortunately I left a putt short [to get into the play-off eventually won by Zach Johnson].

""But the next week usually it's very tough to come back after a week like that and try and compete and play well. And to be able to come back and win at Canada, and kind of nail that putt on the last hole and really show that I can do it, gave me a lot of confidence going forward.

""I was driving the ball great, I was hitting a lot of greens with my irons and putting fantastic; I mean just every putt went in and it was kind of like a dream run that you always think about when you're growing up as a kid.

""It was quite an impressive run for myself. This year's different but I'm going to give it a 100 percent every day and see how it goes.""

Scott Halleran/Getty Images

If his amazing finish to the season wasn't enough, Day and wife Ellie then welcomed their second child, Lucy, in November. There hasn't been as much ""learning"" as their first attempt at parenthood but there has been somewhat of an education for first-time brother Dash.

""You know what, my first time around with Dash it was very difficult for me and Ellie just to kind of get a grip on what parenting is like and also trying to play competitive golf,"" Day said.

""Dash was a little bit of a terror for not going to sleep for two-and-a-half years and he sleeps like a log now which is great. Lucy is a complete angel - the total opposite to what Dash was. She sleeps well, she eats well and barely cries, so it feels like we've just added another person.

""But it really doesn't feel like I'm going from one to two kids because I've heard that it's very difficult going from one to two kids ... so it's neat to have them on the road with me; Dash, he wasn't too happy with us for the first three weeks but now he absolutely loves her.""

A healthy family, fame and fortune; what else does one need? Certainly not a courtside collision between wife Ellie and NBA superstar LeBron James, as happened in December.

David Richard/USA TODAY Sports

The recognition from another Australian sporting icon, the national rugby team, the Wallabies, was a nice surprise, though.

""Yeah I did follow their [the Wallabies'[ journey through the World Cup and the boys played very, very hard,"" Day said with a chuckle when asked about the gold strip sent his way by Kurtley Beale.

""I tell you what, the [New Zealand] All Blacks, [that was] probably the best team they've had, ever. It's just amazing just how great they played through the whole series.

""But it was really generous of the guys to send me a signed jersey -- it's going up in my office. Also, Kurtley Beale gave me a jersey so I wore that when they were playing and it's really neat to see that I've got support from them.

""And you know I was just trying to send them as much support as I could when I sent them a message before, I think it was the Scotland game. So it was fun to see the Wallabies sort of get back on top of things and hopefully they can keep the run going.""

How good is this! Thanks @kurtley_beale and @Wallabies here's hoping we are both No.1 in world soon! #RugbyWorldCup pic.twitter.com/vIL01Tl4u3  Jason Day (@JDayGolf) September 15, 2015

That will be a difficult assignment for the Wallabies, but an even tougher one for Day.

So far this season, he has recorded just the one top 10 - at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions in Hawaii - in three starts while at the weekend's WGC Cadillac Championship in Florida he finished in a tie for 23rd.

And the Queenslander finds himself contesting the most competitive period of golf since Tiger Woods' fall from grace, with fellow young guns Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy creating a ""big three"" at the top of the rankings -- not to mention the resurgence of fellow Aussie Adam Scott who claimed back-to-back PGA titles with a one-shot win at Doral.

Another five-win season and a second major title are tough acts to follow, and Day knows it.

The approach then?

""If I give it 100 percent, I can look at myself at the end of the year in the mirror and say I've given it 100 percent that's what I'm going to be most happy with."" Jason Day

""[I have] very similar goals to last year, which is no goals,"" Day said.

""The only goal that I have is that every day I come to work I give it a 100 percent. I explained this to Bud [Martin], my agent, the other day. I said: 'You know what, five wins was great last year. I'm going to give it a 100 percent every day this year; I'm very motivated to try and become more of a dominant player out there and try and get back to No.1 in the world and stuff like that'.

""But I was explaining to Bud that if I give it 100 percent, I can look at myself at the end of the year in the mirror and say I've given it a 100 percent that's what I'm going to be most happy with.""

""I think any time we take any medication, we double- and triple- and quadruple-check, because sometimes even things like cough drops and nasal sprays can be on the [banned] list,"" Wozniacki said Tuesday at a news conference ahead of her Madison Square Garden match with Serena Williams. ""As athletes we really always make sure there's nothing in it that is prohibited.""

Sharapova, 28, a five-time Grand Slam champion and former No. 1, claims she neglected to read the updated list of banned substances sent by anti-doping officials in December. Sharapova now faces a lengthy, potentially career-ending suspension along with an incalculable loss of prestige and income after testing positive for meldonium.

""Most people were surprised and shocked by Maria, but at the same time, most people were happy she was up front and honest,"" Williams said. ""It showed a lot of courage about what she had done. ... That being said, it's just about taking responsibility, which she admitted she's willing to do.""

Sharapova said she has been using meldonium for health reasons since 2006. The drug is of Latvian origin and not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the U.S. It was put on the list of banned substances for 2016 after a lengthy study determined it was frequently and successfully used as a performance-enhancing drug by elite athletes, many from Russia and eastern Europe.

When Williams was asked whether she resented competing against a doper for a decade, Williams somewhat cryptically replied: ""I'm probably not the best person to ask that question.""

And when asked about speed in which clothing and shoe company Nike (which has contracts with both Sharapova and Williams) suspended its relationship with the Russian star, Williams dismissed the question, saying, ""I can't comment anything on that.""

It's clear that these initial pairings should be nothing short of explosive, with more to come as the tournament progresses -- and you can expect more upsets and the interruption of the ""status quo"" by the time this tournament is over. I guarantee it.

As for what to expect from a strategy point of view, the group stages revealed plenty as far as the hero trends go. The obvious call-outs: Earth Spirit was the most banned hero at 81.3 percent, simply because of the long list of positives that this hero provides to a team. Earth Spirit, Invoker and Enchantress are the three most picked/banned heroes so far, with all of them eclipsing 80 percent (and Earth Spirit at a gaudy 97.9 percent).

As for the most popular selections, five in particular stand out: Vengeful Spirit, Nature's Prophet, Beastmaster, Faceless Void and Batrider. While these picks are no-brainers to DOTA followers, it should be noted that each hero is a proactive contributor with incredible early-game impact. The trend of teams fighting early and often with a pickoff mentality or a heavy push strategy is likely to continue through the later stages of the tournament.

Upper bracket

Alliance vs. Team Liquid

On paper, it's very difficult to decipher which team holds an edge here. One thing to note: If Team Liquid bans the comfort picks of Alliance, this series is going to be very interesting. Those bans would include Lone Druid, Queen of Pain, Puck, Batrider and Nature's Prophet. Alliance's reliance on S4 is absolutely crucial for the team to function; one bad start and it could be lights out. Team Liquid will need to siphon farm into their two mega core players -- FATA- and MATUMBAMAN -- quickly for the team damage to matter, as they've accounted for over 10,000 damage each in their games, with the closest player after those two being JerAx's 6,836 output.

Prediction: Team Liquid in a nail-biter

MVP Phoenix vs. LGD Gaming

Is MVP Phoenix legitimate? That's the first and biggest question I have with this set. If the answer is yes, then this could be another victory for the upward-trending Korean team. They crushed talented teams in Team Secret and EHOME 4-0 in blitzkrieg fashion, with only one game lasting over 30 minutes. On the other side, with LGD Gaming, it's a mixed bag. Either you get the brilliance of rOtK's drafting with the perfect blend of Maybe and Sylar carrying, or the draft is confusing and inconsistent and it's an over-reliance on Maybe to stabilize. If MVP Phoenix can fluster the Chinese team, this could be another quick series.

Prediction: MVP Phoenix

OG vs. Team Secret

It should be noted that Team Secret's group was arguably the toughest of the entire stage, and they made it through, but that's hardly an endorsement for their matchup here against one of the best teams in the tournament. It was an impressive showing for OG, who dominated their games with the damage of N0tail and the individually gifted play of Miracle-. This set will boil down to the support play, and the space creation from Team Secret's pair of Puppey and PieLieDie will be the key to any potential victory. On the other side, OG need Cr1t- and Simbaa (Fly) to dominate the laning phase for their two important cores -- and if one of them falters, it will be a difficult climb back to victory.

Prediction: OG -- Miracle- is simply playing at another level

Evil Geniuses vs. Fnatic

The general consensus is that Evil Geniuses will stomp out Fnatic here. It's the tournament favorite pitted against an inconsistent and largely inexperienced team; Fnatic struggled in their group stage to advance to the upper bracket, but they did show up against the Chinese juggernaut, Vici Gaming -- albeit with the aforementioned opponent in poor form. Simply put, it's just difficult to endorse Fnatic against the execution-heavy and mechanically gifted lineup of Evil Geniuses, as this North American team just does too many things well and boasts two of the best carry players in the game today: Sumail and Arteezy.

Prediction: Evil Geniuses

Lower bracket

EHOME vs. Team Archon

The deck is stacked against Team Archon delivering a single victory in this tournament, and EHOME isn't going to make it any easier. With EHOME, there's the carry menace of Cty, a player who could single-handedly win the game, and the support play of LaNm that usually bails the Chinese team out of many unwinnable situations. The one big positive for Team Archon is their early game aggression -- they draft for the snowball -- but their team fight execution lacks polish. It is possible that Team Archon could just overwhelm EHOME with another draft that emphasizes a roaming hero or two (Mirana, Vengeful Spirit or an Earth Spirit), but don't count on it.

Prediction: EHOME

Team Spirit vs. compLexity Gaming

The broadcast panel talked up Team Spirit quite a bit when they played, but they're simply no match for this revamped compLexity Gaming lineup. The versatility of compLexity Gaming's lineup will be a nightmare to game plan against, as they could shift swindlemelonzz to the carry position and Chessie 2 to the offlane, or put Limmp on a versatile support hero for the middle lane. Team Spirit is linear and somewhat predictable -- they need Iceberg and RAMZES666 to catch fire, or they sink. The experience of compLexity Gaming's new additions put them over the edge, and it should be a quick wrap-up.

Prediction: compLexity Gaming

Virtus.Pro vs. Vici.Gaming

It's almost criminal to see these two consistently top-placing teams face off in the lower bracket's first round. If it's a judgment based on group play, it's Virtus.Pro in a landslide because Vici.Gaming played horribly -- they had little synergy and meaning behind their plays, carry players BurNing and Super were lost and behind most of the time, and Iceiceice was the only real power threat. If this continues, Virtus.Pro's superior team fighting coordination and the duo of G and Lil will overpower the Chinese lineup in one of its quickest exits from a major tournament ever.

Prediction: Virtus.Pro in a close one

CDEC Gaming vs. Newbee

The manual on how to play against CDEC Gaming was out there after their surprising run through ""The International"" -- they smoke gank constantly with predictable timing, they group consistently and force fights, and their drafts are traditional and lack any kind of pizzazz. It should be noted, however, that CDEC Gaming's drafts look much stronger in relation to the patch and the current hero trends, and their opponent doesn't look to be in top-tier form. Newbee looked inconsistent in their overall game plan during the group stage; if it wasn't a strong draft, it was a bad team fight coordination or timing. Either way, Newbee have all the talent in the world to compete with CDEC Gaming, and it should be highly competitive as both squads aren't quite at their best right now.

From their rookie seasons together, their careers have been tied together. From the two forging their own dynasties in their homeland, to the present where one has stayed loyal to the only team he's ever known and the other has become a leader in Korea's rival region of China.

In the chilly spring of 2016 in Poland, their paths have crossed again.

Lee ""Faker"" Sang-hyeok

Editor's Picks From The Mag: The Unkillable Demon King 19-year-old Faker came out of nowhere to become the first true global star of gaming. But can the League of Legends prodigy carry a nation on his shoulders?

Seeking solutions for SKT T1's slump James Chen looks closer at the recent decline of SK Telecom and writes how the once elite team can rebound.

Kimes: Faker stays home to lead SKT The best League of Legends player in the world, Lee ""Faker"" Sang-hyeok, has stayed with his South Korean team SK Telecom T1 and is ready to lead his team to a world championship again. 2 Related

Faker is a once-in-a-generation talent. He only started playing the game seriously due to queue times forcing him to play against higher-caliber players. His skill became well-known across the online servers during his time as an amateur, and his first professional game was (and still is) the most anticipated debut in the game's history.

From the beginning, everyone expected greatness from the teenager known as Faker.

In April it will be three years since his pro-gaming debut, and he did not disappoint on those expectations -- he's the undisputed greatest to ever touch League of Legends. Faker has four domestic titles, two Summoner's Cups and a Worlds MVP -- the last of which came just a few short months after he entered the scene.

Every game has at least one prodigy who entered the professional ranks with all of the expectations in the world and then exceeded them. Basketball has LeBron James. Baseball has Mike Trout. For League of Legends, it's Lee Sang-hyeok.

Cho ""Mata"" Se-hyeong faced a number of issues after leaving Korea and the Samsung Galaxy White team, but he seems to have found something good with his new team, Royal Never Give Up. Riot Games

Cho ""Mata"" Se-hyeong

If there was anyone deserving of the title 'maestro' in League, it would be Mata. While Faker's reputation casts him as a natural, almost instinctive genius, Mata is an intellectual technician. The two began their careers at the same time, in the spring of 2013, and it was a rookie with the ID ""Mata"" who walked away as a champion in his first season -- not Faker.

Cho Se-hyeong's genius can be found in his mastery of in-game leadership. As the leader of the ""Samsung Dynasty"" in 2013 and 2014, he never failed to finish below third place in Korea's Champions league. When it comes to conducting a field of soldiers on the battlefield and achieving total victory, there might not be anyone better than the 2014 world champion and Worlds MVP.

As his current teammate Cheng ""Wuxx"" Wang summarized him best in a recent interview, ""It feels as though Mata created this game.""

Since their constant battles of 2013 and 2014, Faker and Mata have gone down two divergent paths. After beating Faker's SK Telecom T1 and winning a Summoner's Cup of his own with Samsung White in 2014, Mata and the rest of his Samsung teammates (including their sister team) decided to move to China's LPL for better wages. It was widely known that Samsung couldn't pay the top team in the world enough money to stick around in South Korea, and Mata decided to embark on a new journey in 2015 -- to the region he conquered months earlier at the World Championships.

Faker, who also received various offers from Chinese teams, stayed with the better-paying SK Telecom T1 as the face of the franchise. Failing to make the 2014 Worlds drove the prodigious mid laner to train even harder during the offseason -- making him put everything he had into getting back to the throne he wasn't able to defend.

While 2014 was a struggle for Faker, the same and worse could be said for Mata in 2015. While Faker returned to the forefront of the international scene with his revamped, macro-intensive SK Telecom T1, Mata had to adjust to life in China. Due to the rules of domestic teams needing to field at least three players from that region, Mata was only able to play with one of his former Samsung teammates, Choi ""DanDy"" In-kyu, on Vici Gaming.

VG was a far cry from Mata's starting five on Samsung White, and he was forced to take on a mentor role for a team that was trying to incorporate newer talent with veterans like Dandy and Li ""Vasilii"" Wei-Jun. The end result was a precarious situation in which a frustrated Mata lashed out at his teammates, and he was even fined following a tournament game in which he was cited for his non-professional behavior in-game.

For Mata, his frustration boiled down to simply not having a good team. It was the fact that regardless of how hard he tried, the culture in China was radically different from the one he'd known in South Korea. There, he would wake up at a specific time, get on his computer with the rest of his teammates, and get to work diligently through scrimmages, structured practice and solo queue. The Chinese scene was more lax -- waking up late for practice, taking things less seriously and failing to have the meticulous work ethic that the Koreans prided themselves on.

While Mata was left on the sideline at the end of the 2015 season, with VG failing to make World Championships, Faker was on his way to his second world championship in three seasons with SK Telecom T1. The homegrown wunderkind stayed loyal to his original team and led a reconstructed T1 squad to a one-sided Summoner's Cup victory. Mata, like Faker the year before, had to watch from home as his rival lifted the grandest prize in League up into the air, crystalizing his reputation as the one true genius of the game.

Three years into their careers, and as veterans of the game, one thing hasn't changed between the two Korean legends since their rookie debuts in the spring of 2013. It doesn't matter if they play in different leagues, and it wouldn't make a difference even if they played on different continents.

When one of them pulls ahead of the other, it isn't long before the front-runner feels the eyes of his rival right behind him.

Riot Games

The IEM World Championships in Katowice have brought Faker and Mata back together, after they failed to meet last year. Faker, amid rumors wondering if he'd re-sign with T1 following their second world title, quickly signaled his return to the team for another year -- to continue his legacy as the crown jewel of SK Telecom. Mata took longer to decide where he wanted to play in 2016, with some of the speculation pointing towards a possible return to South Korea, where he might sign with the money-infused Longzhu Gaming. In the end, to the surprise of some, he stayed in the country where he had difficulties the previous season, electing to sign with Royal Never Give Up.

SK Telecom T1 has had a middling regular season leading into the IEM World Championships, with a 5-4 record in the difficult LCK. The clean execution they were known for in 2015 has gone by the wayside, with a starting roster change in the top lane. Faker is still the best player in the league, outputting the most damage out of all players in the competition. South Korea has become a tougher and deeper collection of teams over the offseason, and T1 isn't having the same leisurely stroll they enjoyed last summer split.

Mata, as their back-and-forth rivalry would dictate, has had a renaissance since joining RNG. He's partnered up with his former top laner from Samsung White, Jang ""Looper"" Hyeong-seok, and helped Looper return to being one of the best players at his position in the LPL. Under Mata's clear shot-calling, Looper's teleport plays and all-around utility have been on point through the first half of the regular season. RNG also have a good mixture of players who are both on the rise and have the experience of playing in the LPL from the previous year.

The former maestro of the Samsung White empire has taken up a new conducting role with the organization he defeated to win the Summoner's Cup in 2014. The team's bold Baron calls and early-game dominance have led them to one of the top spots in the league. They were even able to sweep their main rivals, the Qiao Gu Reapers, recently -- a team that joined them in Katowice in their own attempt to hoist international hardware.

RNG's success continued in their opening round match at IEM. They began their run with a win over a struggling Origen, the European squad, before turning their sights on the upstart ESC EVER -- a minor league team from Korea. Although their macro play left a lot to be desired in the opening minutes, in terms of tower objective control and reacting to a Western-style lane swap, the team's overall talent and Mata's midgame shot-calling were enough to strong-arm their way to a 2-0 record.

Right now Royal Never Give Up is what could be considered the ""traditional"" Chinese team. They are fantastic mechanically and know how to win in a breakneck pace, and yet they are lagging behind when it comes to the bigger picture of playing the map. With Mata now at the helm, they've been slowly improving every week, and the team has noted their practice sessions have become more beneficial since the former Worlds MVP support joined the team.

With the likes of jungler Liu ""MLXG"" Shi-yu also in the fold, the 10-man RNG roster has multiple weapons which, if used correctly, can create a beautiful -- and deadly -- symphony in the hands of Mata.

Cho ""Mata"" Se-hyeong reached the highest of highs in 2014, as the MVP of the World Championship-winning Samsung Galaxy White -- with more than 40,000 in attendance at Seoul's World Cup Stadium and millions watching at home. Riot Gaming

Faker didn't have to face the prospect of an entirely new team this split, but he's been playing in a different role. Sure, he still plays assassins and attack-heavy champions, but his position this spring has been a lot more about him trying to get his AD carry teammate, Bae ""Bang"" Jun-sik, ahead on champions like Lulu. We saw both sides of Faker in SKT's sweep of their tournament bracket, as he played a superb Lulu game in their set against Counter Logic Gaming, and then played his signature assassin LeBlanc in a flashy performance against the QG Reapers.

The new SK Telecom T1 is equally as talented as their 2015 version, and might be even better mechanically if their rookie jungler Kang ""Blank"" Sun-gu can transition properly into the world of professionals from the amateur scene. Even when SKT T1 might not have been the clear pound-for-pound favorite in firepower last season, they still won games through their beautiful shot-calling -- a style that somewhat mirrored Mata's own work with Samsung White in 2014.

The SKT T1 of 2015 was smooth, and punished every little mistake their enemy made. If the opponent was up in the late-game and made one wrong teleport play or overextension, the game was over -- T1 would capitalize on the blunder, secure Baron Nashor (if was up) and push to a rapid come-from-behind victory.

Currently, SKT T1 is still trying to find its bearings. The team's former captain, Jang ""MaRin"" Gyeong-Hwan, left for China in the offseason and signed with LGD Gaming. He was replaced by spring 2015 regular season MVP Lee ""Duke"" Ho-Seong in the top lane. The move was considered a possible upgrade in the raw skill department, but MaRin was a key part of T1's shot-calling and masterful map movement -- and Duke is notorious for being a stoic-type during games.

The good news for T1 is that they still have six months to go until Worlds qualification becomes an issue, and they've been steadily improving on their teamfighting and communication -- just like RNG. They might not be the same team they were last year, when it comes to macro play and map movement, but that's okay.

2016 doesn't need to be exactly like the 2015 version, just like the 2015 team didn't have to play the same style as the 2013 Summoner's Cup winning team.

espn.com,,World Series of Poker schedule,"['Dave Tuley', 'Ryan Feldman', 'Tim Fiorvanti', 'Bernard Lee']","It may have come a little bit later than in previous years, but the wait for the 2016 World Series of Poker schedule is finally over -- and there's plenty to be excited about in this year's 69-event slate.

All of the big tent-pole events are back for the 2016 WSOP (running from June 1-July 18), save for one -- and more on that later. There are eight brand new events making their debut this summer, widening the spectrum of formats and buy-in levels, which range from $565 to $111,111.

Its hard to fathom that this event can continue to grow the way it has, said WSOP executive director Ty Stewart. But with the schedule weve put together for this year, we are confident 2016 will be another record-breaker at the WSOP.

There are also a significant number of key changes to the 47th edition of the WSOP. Most tournaments will now pay out 15 percent of the field, as opposed to the traditional 10 percent, and that will lead to far more tournaments reaching the money on Day 1. Perhaps one of the most dramatic changes for this coming summer is the adjustment of start times, which will be one hour earlier for all bracelet events and daily Deepstacks tournaments -- setting the starting times for most bracelet events at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.

By paying 50 percent more entrants and reaching the money earlier, we anticipate the 2016 WSOP to be the most rewarding yet, said WSOP tournament director Jack Effel, who will oversee the tournament for the eleventh straight year. Our schedule this year really runs the gamut for all levels of poker enthusiasts, so we hope you will peruse the events and make your plans to join us this summer at the Rio.

Highlights from the schedule release:

The Casino Employees no-limit hold 'em event will once again kick things off, getting underway Wednesday, June 1, and for the first time the tournament will allow a single re-entry.

Colossus II, the first open event of 2016, starts the following day (June 2) and features both $7 million prize pool and $1 million first place prize guarantees, with six starting sessions spread during three days.

Event 4, the first new event on the schedule, is called the 'Top Up Turbo.' It looks to reward players who play single table satellites both online on WSOP.com and at the Rio, as anyone who qualifies in one such tournament earns double the starting stack.

A $565 pot-limit Omaha tournament, the smallest-ever buy in for the game in a bracelet event, debuts in Las Vegas after appearing on the 2015 WSOP Europe schedule. Other similar new events include a $1,500 mixed pot-limit Omaha tournament and a $1,500 half no-limit hold 'em, half pot-limit Omaha event.

The Millionaire Maker returns with starting flights Friday, June 10 and Saturday, June 11. Both the winner and the runner-up are guaranteed at least $1 million. The Monster Stack is also back, with two starting days of its own (June 24 and 25).

The 'Summer Solstice' $1,500 no-limit hold 'em event, which features 90-minute levels, kicks off on the longest day of the year.

The biggest buy-in events are bunched toward the end of the summer; The $50,000 Poker Players Championship starts on July 3, the $25,000 pot-limit Omaha high-roller kicks off on July 6 and the $111,111 High Roller for One Drop is the last tournament to start before the main event, on July 8.

You may notice the one glaring absence from this schedule -- the biannual $1 million Big One for One Drop. Not to worry, say WSOP officials -- it will take place in 'grand fashion, but it won't be in Las Vegas as part of the summer schedule.' Speaking of One Drop, the main event will not be the last bracelet event of the summer for the first time in nearly a decade -- the Little One for One Drop holds that distinction in 2016.

For the first time in more than 20 years, a team bracelet event will be a part of the WSOP schedule. Teams of two to four players will put up a total buy-in of $1,000, with the ability for any inactive team member to 'tag-in' after a minimum of one orbit played by any of their teammates. Each of the players on a team will get their own bracelet.

There are some big changes in store for the main event as well. For 2016, main event players will receive 50,000 in chips -- the most ever given for this tournament (and the new standard for $10,000 events at the WSOP). Either 1,000 places or 15 percent of the main event field will get paid -- whichever of those numbers is bigger. The ante will kick in a bit earlier in the main event, too, changing the dynamic and strategy a bit.

As is the case for most other tournaments this summer, action kicks off at 11 a.m. each day, and players will once again have three starting flights to choose from -- Saturday, July 9, Sunday, July 10 or Monday, July 11. Day 2 will play out on either July 12 or 13, depending on starting session, and the field will combine completely on July 14.

The final summer day of the 2016 WSOP -- the day when the November Nine is set -- is July 18. Coverage of the main event will air toward the end of the summer, and they'll return to play out the final table of the 2016 WSOP main event live on ESPN airwaves from Oct. 30-Nov. 1.

Duke: Demolishes lane opponent to secure IEM World Championship

Name: Lee ""Duke"" Ho-Seong

Team: SK Telecom T1

Update: Duke played an impressive series, utilizing terrifying tanks to earn a 19/5/16 KDA in three games.

Analysis: Duke demonstrated his expertise in the top lane against Gamsu in the three game sweep over Fnatic. In Game One of the series, he fell behind due to a lane swap into freeze set up by his opponents, but was able to roam quickly to pick up several kills for himself and his team. He was able to translate this kill advantage to a terrifying presence in team fights to come back from the small disadvantage they had. In Game Two, Duke played the lane even better than he had in the previous game, earning a 7/3/7 KDA and absolutely dominating his lane opponent. Once again, as soon as he was able to gain a lead he ran with it, assisting in strangling his opponents out of the game. Despite the game lasting a near 40 minutes, Duke was able to retain his low death count while continuously diving into the enemy to peel for his carries and force Rekkles out of the fight. His play was instrumental in the success of SKT in the second game. Moving into Game Three, Duke put on yet another beefy front liner. Opting for Nautilus, he fell behind in farm against Graves, as expected. Once again, he was able to mitigate the disadvantage through roaming and creating picks and fights in his teams favor. This game ended up being the most impressive, as he picked up a whopping six kills while on a tank and absolutely closing any opportunity for the enemy to comeback forcing them to surrender in 22 minutes. This secured SKT's title of IEM Katowice 2016 Champions.

Faker: Challenged in IEM Final but able to prevail

Name: Lee ""Faker"" Sang-hyeok

Team: SK Telecom T1

Update: Faker had an exceptional performance in the IEM Grand Finals to claim the 2016 Championship and sweep Fnatic in the finals.

Analysis: Faker started off the series rocky, getting solo killed by his lane opponent Febiven. After this, he played more conservatively and to Corki's strengths, dealing massive damage and poking along with Ezreal to deter Fnatic from taking objectives or picking fights. Falling behind early, the scaling potential of his team comp kept Faker from making any attempted hero plays and the team was able to take several favorable team fights to swing the score back in their favor and close out the first game of the series. Faker brought out an extremely unexpected Vel'Koz in Game Two and used it to great success. Despite a 40 minute game, he died only twice, while dealing insane amounts of damage. His positioning in team fights was immaculate, keeping himself safe from the dive of Lee Sin, Nautilus, and Lissandra. His crucial ultimates and use of his zoning abilities landed him the victory in Game Two placing his team in a good spot to claim the Championship Title. Game Three saw one of Faker's best performance of the series. Being placed on his well known Zed, he was able to quickly navigate the map and dominate all lanes making it impossible for Fnatic to do anything. By 22 minutes, he had choked out all the lanes to the point that Fnatic was down over 10,000 gold and forcing them to surrender, earning himself the IEM Championship trophy.

Bang: Near flawless performance against Fnatic in IEM Grand Finals

Name: Bae ""Bang"" Jun-sik

Team: SK Telecom T1

Update: Bang played an exceptional series to sweep Fnatic in the IEM Finals, earning a series KDA of 15/3/30.

Analysis: Once again Bang has managed to maintain one of the highest KDA's in competitive League of Legends, earning a 15.0 KDA in the IEM Grand Finals. Game One allowed him to play his signature Ezreal and he played it to great success. He had to gain an early advantage to keep up with Fnatic's late game Kog'maw potential. Unfortunately, the team fell behind early, but Bang was able to maintain his footing and keep himself in the game. Several team fights broke out and his excellent positioning combined with his ability to deal the highest possible damage per second allowed his team to mount a comeback and close out Game One. In Game Two, he had an even more impressive performance on Ezreal, earning a 7/1/15 scoreline and participating in all but two of his team's kills. Once again, his positioning was to envy and he absolutely demolished Fnatic. Unable to catch him, they were forced to allow him to deal massive amounts of damage without any response. His play was especially impressive, given that he only died once in the 40 minute game. Despite this impressive performance, his final game of the series is arguably even more impressive as he remained deathless and forced Fnatic to surrender. He was able to create an early lead for himself with the help of Faker's roams and destroyed Rekkles shot at the IEM title. In just 22 minutes, he would help his team gain a 10,000 gold lead and give Rekkles a 0/4/1 KDA to end the series.

Wolf: Impressive tank play to secure IEM Victory

Name: Lee ""Wolf"" Jae-wan

Team: SK Telecom T1

Update: Wolf played a mixture of Braum and Alistar to engage for his team and make short work of Fnatic, earning himself a series KDA of 2/6/43.

Analysis: Once again, Wolf was able to help secure an SKT victory with his shot calling and leadership. Throughout the series, he was able to set up various engages that lead to favorable fights even when his team was already behind. Adding to his ability to help his team close out the game, his vision control was immaculate, allowing his team to move undetected through the enemy territory throughout the series to obtain vital information and secure contested objectives. By putting himself on champions that can roam, he was able to make plays around the map without putting his team at a disadvantage by leaving his lane. In Game One, although his team fell behind early, he was able to land a clutch Braum ultimate on more than one occasion to start a fight and ensure his team's victory. Game Two put him on Braum, where once again he was able to gain an early lead in lane and transition it to the rest of the map through warding and vision plays. This allowed him to keep his team safe in a 40 minute victory. In the final game of the series he was allowed to get Alistar, his signature champion where he headbutted his way to victory, forcing Fnatic to surrender in just 22 minutes as he dominated the map. This allowed his team to be crowned the IEM Katowice 2016 Champions.

MARCH 6, 2016

Doublelift: Can't hang in lane in sweep by SK Telecom T1

Name: Yiliang ""Doublelift"" Peng

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Doublelift and Team SoloMid got taken apart in team fights throughout the series and he finished with a 2/7/1 KDA.

Analysis: Doublelift wasn't able to be much of a factor in Game One. He tried to stay close during the laning phase but got caught out of position and started to fall behind on his slow scaling champion Ezreal. The rest of the game was dominated by SKT, and they were able to catch Doublelift out of position a few more times before finishing the game. Game Two went slightly better for Doublelift on Kalista, but SKT's team fighting skills were too much for TSM. They lost the game in 25 minutes.

Yell0wStaR: Roughed up in sweep by SK Telecom T1

Name: Bora ""Yell0wStaR"" Kim

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Yellowstar had a problematic series and finished with a 0/8/3 KDA.

Analysis: Game One was almost all SKT, and Yellowstar wasn't able to be of much use for TSM as a front line tank on Alistar. TSM had poor positioning in team fights, and SKT got the better of them in the second half of the game. In Game Two Yellowstar opted to pick Janna, which left TSM without a front line tank. He made Janna's kit work for him somewhat throughout the game as he used his tornados and ultimate to disengage and get away from some fights. However Janna is really squishy, and Yellowstar became the early target for SKT in team fights and finished Game Two with the most deaths for TSM. SKT continued their team fight dominance, and it only took them 25 minutes to best TSM in Game Two.

Hauntzer: Swept by SK Telecom T1

Name: Kevin ""Hauntzer"" Yarnell

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Hauntzer had a poor series and finished with a 2/4/1 KDA.

Analysis: Hauntzer picked Nautilus in Game One and was counter picked -- which led to him losing lane. He roamed from lane and picked up an assist early, but it wasn't enough to make up for his gold deficit against Duke's Trundle. Team fights really didn't go well in Game One, and TSM was destroyed in the second half of the game. Game Two's laning phase went slightly better for Hauntzer, he fell behind on CS but made up for it by picking up first blood on Duke. However the game didn't last long enough for Hauntzer to get fed enough and become the split pushing monster that is late game Fiora. SKT started to group up and dismantle TSM in fights and finished the game in 25 minutes.

Svenskeren: Can't overcome counter jungling in series loss to SK Telecom T1

Name: Dennis ""Svenskeren"" Johnsen

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Svenskeren was constantly bullied in his jungle in series against SK Telecom T1. He finished with a 3/7/4 KDA.

Analysis: Svenskeren had a slow start to Game One, Blank invaded early and stole jungle camps early, which earned him a lead in farm. Most of TSM's lanes fell behind early but Svenskeren helped Bjergsen in mid and got him some kills early. However SKT was too much for TSM in team fights, and they took over the second half of the game. The jungle invasions remained a problem for Svenskeren in Game Two. He was still able to make plays and get his team some kills, but TSM couldn't hang with SKT in team fights, and they lost the game in 25 minutes.

Bjergsen: Rough Game Two during sweep by SK Telecom T1

Name: Soren ""Bjergsen"" Bjerg

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Bjergsen had a strong Game One but didn't impact Game Two and finished with a 3/6/4 KDA in the series.

Analysis:Bjergsen was staying close in the laning phase of Game One; he made good trades with Faker and with the help of his team got the first kills and knocked down the first tower in his lane. However he wasn't fed enough on LeBlanc to carry his team in fights, and SKT dominated the second half of the game. Game Two had a similar start where Bjergsen stayed close in lane and knocked down the first tower in his lane, but once SKT grouped for team fights TSM couldn't stop them. Bjergsen wasn't able to make good use of Twisted Fate's global ultimate. Usually its best use is for teleporting in and cutting off the enemy's escape route or flanking in a fair fight to give his team the numbers advantage, but Bjergsen never had situations to use it that way. Mainly he used the ultimate to try to secure kills for his team but ended up only getting assists. All of Bjergsen's kills came in the first game of the series, and TSM had no chance of winning Game Two without one of their main damage dealers picking up kills and getting fed.

Gamsu: Outclassed in series sweep by SKT

Name: Yeong-Jin ""Gamsu"" Noh

Team: Fnatic

Update: Gamsu was unable to out perform Duke in Fnatic's series loss against SKT, earning himself a series KDA of 5/11/11.

Analysis:Starting out the series in a lane swap, Gamsu was put in an unfavorable position. He was able to set up an expert lane freeze to earn himself a 30 CS advantage by 10 minutes. His early advantage was quickly mitigated as Duke roamed to catch up and create himself a quick advantage of his own. An unfortunate team fight at 30 minutes blew open the game and Gamsu was unable to help his team close out the game. Game Two in the series told a similar story yet one that was not as impressive for Gamsu. After falling behind early as Nautilus, he was unable to make a sufficient impact on any fights and Duke quickly ran away with the lane. Gamsu's positioning was lacking and he was unable to peel for his team or create the necessary picks to open the game up. Hoping that it couldn't get worse, Gamsu was put on Graves in Game Three to hopefully allow himself to create a lane advantage and transition it into a win to bring his team back in the series. Starting the game off strong, he picked up first blood onto his lane opponent with the help of his team diving Duke. Unfortunately, this would be the extent of his success in Fnatic's final game loss against SKT, as he was repeatedly focused while Duke was able to roam using Nautilus' crowd control to great affect picking up kill after kill. The domination would only last 22 minutes as Fnatic surrendered, falling 0-3 to SKT in the IEM Katowice Grand Finals.

Spirit: Unable to kick his way to victory against World Champions

Name: Lee ""Spirit"" Da-yoon

Team: Fnatic

Update: Spirit played three Lee Sin games against SKT but was unable to create the plays necessary to claim the victory in this series sweep, earning himself a KDA of 5/15/12.

Analysis:Spirit had a strong start to the series against SKT, picking up several early kills and assisting his team in fights to create an advantage early on. After creating a rather large lead, 29 minutes into the game showed a change of pace as Fnatic was able to respond to a slow engage. This turned the game around and Spirit was unable to open the game up after. Game Two was a disappointingly uncharacteristic performance from Spirit who seemed to be playing desperately - and his KDA showed it. A high kill game resulted in him finishing the game 0/6/7 with minimal impact as Rekkles tried desperately to carry his team. Blank simply outclassed Spirit in terms of vision control as well as early pressure to land Fnatic their second loss of the series. In Game Three, Spirit opted for Lee Sin once again, and had another poor performance. The early game was blown open quickly by Blank giving Fnatic no time to respond. Spirit tried desperately to create plays, but once again his lanes had fallen behind and the situation was not redeemable, and as Fnatic lost a fight at the 21 minute mark, they opted to surrender.

Febiven: Solo kills Faker - not enough to win the series

Name: Fabian ""Febiven"" Diepstraten

Team: Fnatic

Update: Febiven had an impressive showing his series against SKT. Despite his 7/9/10 KDA, he played well but was unable to clench the victory against the World Champions.

Analysis:Starting off the series, Febiven was determined to show that he is as good of a mid laner as Faker. Giving himself the counterpick, he took Zed into Corki and showed his proficiency on the champion picking up first blood in a solo kill 1-v-1. Unfortunately, Febiven's success in the remainder of the game was limited. After several close fights, SKT was able to turn the game on it's heels and close it out quickly. In Game Two, Febiven turned to a more controlled style of play picking Lissandra. He was met with Faker's Vel'Koz and seemingly unprepared. After assisting his team in picking up first blood he gained a lead for himself in lane against Fkaer and started roaming around the map to help the rest of his team. This allowed Fnatic to pick up an early advantage, but unfortunately Spirit was caught out repeatedly throwing the lead away. Febiven was heavily focused, but able to make an impact with his lock down. After SKT secured a baron, the game was too far gone to redeem and Febiven was unable to make up for his teams positioning errors leading to a Game Two loss. In the final game, Febiven played the reverse matchup of Game One, picking Corki and being up against Faker's Zed. Although he was able to maintain his footing in lane, Faker repeatedly roamed participating in seven kills by 16 minutes while Febiven had only participated in two. The game was too far gone, and the poke coming from Corki was unable to deter SKT from steamrolling the rest of the team leading to a 22 minute surrender and Fnatic's final loss at IEM.

Rekkles: Unable to take down Bang to claim IEM Championship

Name: Martin ""Rekkles"" Larsson

Team: Fnatic

Update: Rekkles had an impressive showing in the first two games against SKT, but faltered in the third, earning a series KDA of 7/10/10.

Analysis:Being given Kog Maw in Game One, Rekkles had the task of carrying his team resting on his shoulders. After picking up an early kill, he was able to assist his team in pushing their lead and gaining resulting objectives. His positioning in early fights was immaculate, kiting away from the Poppy, Braum, and Gragas who attempted to dive him constantly. After 23 minutes, he had still not died and was boasting a 1/0/3 scoreline but was met with a flank to earn his first death of the game. 30 minutes in showed the game was neck and neck but a team fight resulted in Rekkles unable to output the necessary damage to carry his team and SKT rallied to quickly close out Game One. In Game Two Rekkles was on Kog Maw once again, and similar to Game One started out with a lead by picking up first blood. He was able to push his lead by gaining a farm advantage and forcing Bang to play passively. Unfortunately, he was unable to match the dive from an aggressive SKT and after getting aced at dragon, Fnatic was unable to comeback and fell after a long drawn out game. Rekkles earned a KD of 5/3/4 in Game Two. Rekkles appeared to be exhausted in Game Three and played poorly. His Kalista was quickly dominated by a roaming Zed and he was unable to do anything except continue to spiral downwards. After a disappointing 22 minutes, he had a 0/4/1 scoreline and his team opted to surrender, conceding the IEM Championship to SKT .

Klaj: Rookie unable to stand up against World Champions in series loss

Name: Johan ""Klaj"" Olsson

Team: Fnatic

Update: Klaj had a valiant performance against World Champions SKT, but was unable to outclass them earning a 2/14/16 KDA in three losses.

Analysis:Klaj had an overall disappointing performance against SKT but one that was nothing short of expected. After joining Fnatic earlier this year, the team has not found much success and being pitted against the World Champions is one of the most daunting tasks to throw a rookie into. In Game One, he was able to assist in picking up some early kills for his team and a small lead, but it came at the cost of several deaths. His play was strong, but not nearly enough to keep SKT down who wiped Fnatic in a fight and quickly closed out the game with their lead. Klaj opted for Thresh in Game Two, and played slightly better than his previous games performance. He hit several impressive hooks and flays, but as his jungle and top lane fell behind, so did the rest of the team. A long drawn out game resulted in a 1/6/5 KDA as SKT's bot lane had free reign and dominated the map. In an attempt to redeem his previous performance, Klaj once again picked Thresh in the final game of the series. This game was the shortest of all of them as Klaj and Rekkles were unable to stand up to their opponents in the bot lane who quickly gained a lead and completely shut Rekkles down. As Klaj attempted to make plays to get his team back in the game SKT capitalized and got star player Faker extremely ahead, forcing Fnatic to surrender at 22 minutes and making them the IEM Katowice 2016 Second Place finishers.

MARCH 5, 2016

Xmithie: Good start to series but can't finish, lose in three to Fnatic

Name: Jake ""Xmithie"" Puchero

Team: Counter Logic

Update: Xmithie had a 6/11/28 KDA in series loss to Fnatic.

Analysis: Xmithie was able to farm his way to a gold lead in Game 1 and was a split push threat but mainly stuck with his teammates to team fight. The team fights were mainly just buying time for Darshan to split push, and it paid off with a win. The last two games of the series had similar starts and finishes for CLG. It would get an early lead but started to get picked apart in team fights which allowed FNC to take over the game and win.

Huhi:Tough series loss to Fnatic after strong start

Name: Choi ""Huhi"" Jae-hyun

Team: Counter Logic

Update: Huhi finished with an 18/14/22 KDA in series loss to Fnatic

Analysis: Huhi had solid Lulu play Game 1 in the best-of-three series and finished with a 3/2/10 KDA. He made good use of Wild Growth to save teammates multiple times and turn team fights around for CLG. Huhi did waste his teleport summoner spell early in Game 1, but it didn't hurt CLG. In Game 2, he picked Pantheon and it worked well for him in the early and mid game, but fell off late. Pantheon is a strange pick for a mid laner, but FNC also had a rarely seen pick in middle lane, Quinn. CLG's team fighting started to unravel late in the Game 2, and its problems continued into Game 3. FNC made get picks and flanks to dominate team fights in the second half of Game 3 and win the series.

Stixxay: Reverse swept in series loss to Fnatic

Name: Trevor ""Stixxay"" Hayes

Team: Counter Logic

Update: Stixxay finished with an 18/10/23 KDA in Counter Logic Gaming's loss to Fnatic

Analysis: Stixxay had a great Game 1 on Ezreal and finished with a 7/1/8 KDA. In team fights, he sat in the back line and dealt damage, and if he ever got in a bad situation, Aphromoo was there to save him with a Thresh lantern. Game 2 started out well for Stixxay, but CLG started to get picked apart during team fights in the late game and lost. Game 3 was a lot like Game 2, but faster. CLG had a small early lead, but once team fights started, FNC took over the game.

Aphromoo: Strong team play early, falls off late in series loss to Fnatic

Name: Zaqueri ""Aphromoo"" Black

Team: Counter Logic

Update: Aphromoo finished with a 10/11/39 KDA in the series loss to Fnatic

Analysis: Aphromoo was CLG's playmaker in Game 1 of the series. His play on Thresh was near perfect. There were numerous Lantern saves throughout the game and plenty of hooks that resulted in an assist. Games 2 and 3 didn't go as well for him and CLG. While it would get out to good starts, its team fights became sloppy later in the game and FNC took over and won. Aphromoo had great kill participation throughout the series and was one of the better playmakers for CLG.

Darshan: Split push not enough to best Fnatic

Name: Darshan ""Darshan"" Upadhyaha

Team: Counter Logic

Update: Darshan finished with a 8/12/13 KDA in the series loss to Fnatic.

Analysis: Darshan used Vladimir as his counter pick in Game 1 and won lane. Vladimir is very slow at knocking down tower, but Darshan was still able to make successful split pushes throughout the game. Game 2 went well for Darshan and CLG in the beginning, but it couldn't win a team fight late that allowed it enough time to finish, and FNC made a come from behind victory. Its team fighting problems continued and cost it Game 3 and the best-of-three series. Darshan stuck to split pushing this series, and it was successful in Game 1, where his team was winning fights without him, but his team couldn't hold up without him in later games.

Xmithie: Poor team fights in loss to SKT

Name: Jake ""Xmithie"" Puchero

Team: Counter Logic

Update: Xmithie got off to a decent start but couldn't help his team rally from behind against SKT. LoL news archive Looking for more League of Legends news? Read the archives here.

Analysis: CLG opted for a team fighting composition rather than sticking to their split push strategy that worked well for them in the North American LCS. Xmithie picked up CLG's first kill on Duke but wasn't much of a factor for the rest of the game and finished with a 1/1/0 KDA. CLG's team fights weren't very good partially because Xmithie didn't land many useful Gragas ultimates to help his team get picks. SKT's early gold lead grew for the rest of the game and CLG wasn't able to overcome it.

Darshan: Picked tank top instead of split pusher in loss to SKT

Name: Darshan ""Darshan"" Upadhyaha

Team: Counter Logic

Update: Darshan got caught out early and wasn't able to make much of an impact in team fights.

Analysis: While CLG had success with a split pushing strategy they didn't use that strategy against SKT. Darshan, usually CLG's main split pusher, picked the tank top laner Poppy and finished with a 0/2/0 KDA. CLG's team composition was all about team fighting but they didn't have very good team fights. SKT's poke was too much for CLG and they got chunked down very quickly before they could make a strong engage. They kept things close but SKT got too much of a gold lead and dominated fights and neutral team objectives on their way to defeating CLG.

MARCH 4, 2016

Yell0wStaR: Comfort picks in series sweep of ESC Ever

Name: Bora ""Yell0wStaR"" Kim

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Yellowstar picked Alistar in both games against ESC ever and finished with a 1/1/28 KDA.

Analysis: Yellowstar played as Alistar in both games against ESC Ever and was the only tank in TSM's lineup. Overall he did great at setting up and engaging in fights but did have some sloppy fights in the first game. Being the only tank meant that he was in the front line soaking up a lot of damage in both games but he kept his deaths low and only died once. The first game of the series ESC stayed close for the most part and fell off in the end but the second game was all TSM.

Doublelift: Rakes in kills and assists in sweep of ESC Ever

Name: Yiliang ""Doublelift"" Peng

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Doublelift had the highest kill participation in series against ESC Ever and finished with a 14/4/16 KDA.

Analysis: Doublelift started off slow in the first game of the series but had a strong game from start to finish in the second to beat ESC Ever 2-0. He picked Kog'Maw in game one and finished with a 10/4/9 KDA. Some of his deaths could have been easily avoided because they were caused by poor pathing through unwarded parts of the jungle and being too far forward in team fights.

These mistakes were corrected in Game Two where Doublelift picked Ezreal and finished with a 4/0/7 KDA. ESC Ever was only able to stay in Game One thanks to TSM's inability to put together a clean team fight. The second game TSM put together much better team fights and only gave up three kills on their way to winning the game and series.

Bjergsen: Near perfect KDA against ESC Ever

Name: Soren ""Bjergsen"" Bjerg

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Bjergsen put up a 14/1/10 KDA in the sweep of ESC Ever.

Analysis: Bjergsen played great with his team in the first game on Zilean and finished with a 6/1/8 KDA. He landed some solid double bomb stuns in team fights and saved his teammates lives throughout the game with Zilean's ultimate. TSM put up some poorly coordinated team fights but slowly pushed in all lanes on ESC and won the game with a Baron power play.

The second game Bjergsen got fed on LeBlanc, and finished with an 8/0/2 KDA. TSM had a gold lead early which grew for the rest of the game. TSM was able to be more coordinated in fights during the second game, and trend they would like to continue if they want to beat Royal Never Give Up in the next round.

Svenskeren: Got team early lead with first blood in both games

Name: Dennis ""Svenskeren"" Johnsen

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Svenskeren was the jungler to make the first ganks in each game and finished the series with a 4/3/19 KDA.

Analysis: Svenskeren was able to help his team get first blood in both games against ESC Ever in the best-of-three series. The early lead was squandered in the first game because of sloppy team fights but TSM was able to build a tower lead and eventually get a Baron Nashor buff for a final push to win. Svenskeren got picked off in some team fights but finished with a solid 1/3/13 KDA on Lee Sin.

During the second game TSM's early gold lead helped the team snowball their way to victory. Game Two was pretty clean for TSM overall and they only gave up three deaths, none of which came from Svenskeren who finished with a 3/0/6 KDA on Elise.

Hauntzer: Applied split push pressure in sweep of ESC Ever

Name: Kevin ""Hauntzer"" Yarnell

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Hauntzer played split push champions in the series against ESC Ever and finished with a 6/5/13 KDA.

Analysis: Hauntzer was a split pushing menace in Game One on Fiora and finished with a 4/2/8 KDA. He had a great start to the game by picking up a double kill for first blood and was able to have a lead in lane for the rest of the game. TSM put together some sloppy team fights in the mid game which allowed ESC Ever to stay in the game. Hauntzer was able to split push which drew Crazy, ESC's only tank, out of team fights, leaving TSM a favorable 4-vs-4 match up. TSM kept the pressure on ESC Ever and slowly pushed in all lanes before getting Baron Nashor and pushing to win.

In the second game Fiora was picked by ESC and Hauntzer decided to pick Quinn against it. Hauntzer got help from his team to get a kill and tower advantage in lane and then roamed for rest of the game. He made some mistakes overextending in team fights which got himself killed those became the only deaths of the game for TSM as the club performed well. TSM's team fights were much cleaner in the second game which allowed them to snowball their way to victory and complete the sweep of ESC Ever in the best of three series.

Looper: Runs away with a favorable matchup

Name: Jang ""Looper"" Hyeong-seok

Team: Royal Never Give Up

Update: While Looper's 3/2/10 KDA may not raise any eyebrows, his impact on RNG's win over Ever cannot be overstated.

Analysis: Sometimes, players win their advantages by the most slim of margins in a contest of skill, between two evenly matched opponents. Then other times one player blind picks a Vladimir. Fortunately for Looper, his opponent Crazy did the latter. With nearly no hesitation Looper locked in the Quinn that he introduced to the LPL meta, with results that were as predictable as the changing of seasons.

While Looper never found himself in a position to kill Crazy outright until the end of the game, where it notably caused RNG to win within 90 seconds, he did dominate the lane to the point where he nearly passed the vaunted ""Flame Horizon"", the colloquial name for having a hundred more minion kills than the enemy laner. While his teleports and team fighting was a bit rough, that was never his purpose to begin with, and despite it his team never lost a fight outright. This game will certainly serve as a warning to other teams later on in this tournament: a warning that while Looper might not yet be his 2014 self, he's on his way back.

KeY: Feeds hard in Game Two of Series

Name: Han-gi ""KeY"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Key ended Ever's 0-2 series loss to TSM with a 1/12/8 KDA on Bard.

Analysis: Playing Bard in both games, his Game One performance was decent despite giving away first blood. He was able to help Ever keep the game close by setting up kills with his Cosmic Binding and resetting fights using his ultimate. It wasn't enough for the win but it was certainly better than his game two performance where he went 0/7/0. An awful showing on his best champion, he was caught repeatedly out of position to give away easy kills as TSM snowballed the game for a 2-0 series win.

LoKeN: Can't carry Ever to series win over TSM

Name: Lee ""LoKeN"" Dong-Wook

Team: Ever

Update: Loken ended Ever's series loss to TSM with a 3/8/6 KDA.

Analysis: Loken laned swapped and farmed early in both games, one on Kalista and one on Lucian. He was killed early in Game One as Ever gave over a double kill to Hauntzer on Fiora. That caused Ever to struggle to deal with the TSM top laner and they were split pushed down throughout the game. In Game Two Ever was thoroughly dominated and Loken struggled to have any major effect on the game, only picking up an assist.

Tempt: Up and down performance on Lux

Name: Kang ""Tempt"" Myung-Gu

Team: Ever

Update: Tempt finished Ever's series loss to TSM with a 3/3/7 KDA.

Analysis: Playing Lux in both games, Tempt had decent moments but nothing carry worthy. In Game One he used his teleport to support his team around the map picking up kills and helping keep the game close. In Game Two, however, he had no real effect, only able to pick up one assist after falling behind Bjergsen. His team also fell behind and TSM took an easy Game Two win.

Ares: Poor Graves performance highlights series loss

Name: Min-kwon ""Ares"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Ares finished Ever's series loss to TSM with a 4/8/7 KDA.

Analysis: Ares played Graves and then Nidalee and in both performances were the team was left wanting more by the Korean jungler. In Game One he struggled to really deal damage on Graves in team fights and was killed often as he was out of position in the frontline. Similar things happened in Game Two as he farmed well but had no real chance to gank lanes or team fight with TSM dominating the game from the start.

Crazy: Given no chance to split push

Name: Jah-hee ""Crazy"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Crazy ended Ever's series loss to TSM with a 3/8/4 KDA.

Analysis: Playing Nautilus in Game One, he tried to set up kills using his ultimate and hook early on in the game with moderate success. As the game wore on he really struggled to deal with Hauntzer's split push and struggled to stay alive long enough in team fights to set up kills. In Game Two he tried his hand at split pushing on Fiora, but Ever was dominated by TSM. He fell behind early in lane and never got a chance to split push as TSM controlled the map and snowballed the game early.

mIxg: Puts up an incredible MVP performance on Nidalee

Name: Liu ""mlxg"" Shi-yu

Team: Royal Never Give Up

Update: mlxg ripped Ever apart with his spectacular Nidalee play, earning himself a 5/0/9 KDA in his victory over them.

Analysis: It's long been held that China, moreso than any other region, has a surfeit of gifted Nidalee players. mlxg sure lived up to that reputation in his game against Ever, going completely unkilled while managing to find himself advantages all around the map. His map play, though, was only the beginning, as his team fighting was the stuff of legends.

In mlxg's hands, Nidalee seemed to be more than the mediocre team fighting champion she is typically viewed as. Instead, he found the perfect balance between poking from afar and diving into the fray, finding himself kills in circumstances that looked all but lost. That he managed to stand out with such distinction even in a game that was RNG's from beginning to end is a testament to the skill with which he performed.

Xiaohu: Fearlessly starts fights he knows his team will finish

Name: Li ""Xiaohu"" Yuan-Hao

Team: Royal Never Give Up

Update: Xiaohu, in a complete departure from his style earlier today, took up Lissandra, earning a 3/1/11 KDA while getting RNG the fights they wanted.

Analysis: In a complete 180 from his performance earlier today, Xiaohu decided to bring Lissandra in the first game, favoring a more engage-heavy style after his Corki was picked away. The pick proved fortituous for RNG, as Ever opted into an incredibly fragile composition who had few that could survive the full burst of Xiaohu, and that had few ways to lock her down. Each fight throughout the game saw Xiaohu get multiple key CC's off while zoning Ever out of the fight.

By the time the game was drawing to a close, Ever was afraid even to pass by him while he was locked away in Zhonya's hourglass, only too aware of the grisly end that would await them were they to get too close. While Xiaohu might not have earned the most impressive looking score in the game, it was his zoning and initiation that allowed his allies to carry the fight, making him a key link in their success.

Mithy: Bloodthirsty game one doesn't equate to series win

Name: Alfonso ""Mithy"" Aguirre Rodriguez

Team: Origen

Update: Mithy ended Origen's three game series against TSM with a 4/9/34 KDA.

Analysis: Mithy played well throughout the series with two games on Thresh and a game on Braum. His game two Thresh performance was excellent as he landed multiple hooks throughout the game to finish with a game high 20 assists. The same can be said in Game One as he was able to consistently land hooks, but also was a bit blood thirsty picking up four kills in the game. Game Three he was able to help Origen to an early lead using Braum's passive to set up kills and help push down objectives. It wasn't enough in the end as TSM steam rolled Origen in team fights to take a 2-1 series win.

Zven: Plays well despite series loss to TSM

Name: Jesper ""Zven"" Svenningsen

Team: Origen

Update: Zven finished Origen's series loss to TSM with a 24/6/12 KDA.

Analysis: Zven was able to perform well in two losses on Lucian and dominated in Origen's win on Kalista. The Kalista game showed just how good he is on the champion as he hard carried, going 13/2/6 in Origen's one win. Even in their losses he was able to give Origen their best chance of winning picking up kills and dealing damage. Zven farmed well throughout the series and although his team was knocked out, they had a good showing at IEM 2016.

PowerOfEvil: No standout performances as Origen are knocked out of IEM

Name: Tristan ""PowerOfEvil"" Schrage

Team: Origen

Update: PowerOfEvil ended Origen's three game series against TSM with a 10/12/19 KDA.

Analysis: PowerOfEvil used Lissandra, Twisted Fate, and Talon in the three games with his best performance coming on Twisted Fate in Game Two. In the two losses he fell behind Bjergsen early and in Game One he was mainly used to try to set up kills for his teammates. In his good Game Two performance he still struggled to effectively roam the map using his ultimate and teleport but did set up kills in team fights using his gold card. In Game Three he went with Talon and started well, but as the game wore on he couldn't effectively assassinate TSM carries in team fights.

Amazing: Decent objective control despite lost series

Name: Maurice ""Amazing"" Stuckenschneider

Team: Origen

Update: Amazing finished Origen's best of three series against TSM with a 7/9/27 KDA.

Analysis: Amazing played Nidalee and two Elise games in the three game series as TSM knocked Origen out of IEM Katowice. He played decently throughout the series helping Origen to control objectives including dragon and Rift Herald while pushing lanes. He performed better on Elise helping to secure kills by rooting champions using her cocoon ability to rack up assists. In the end it wasn't enough as TSM was able to come out with a 2-1 series win.

sOAZ: sOAZ can't split push Origen to series win

Name: Paul ""sOAZ"" Boyer

Team: Origen

Update: sOAZ finished Origen's best of three series against TSM with a 3/10/30 KDA.

Analysis: sOAZ played Poppy and two Trundle games in the series as Origen was knocked out of IEM Katowice. He looked to split push in all three games but only really found success in Origen's Game Two win. The underlying deterrent in the series for sOAZ was his inability to play safely at times, overextending and giving away easy kills in all three games. He tried to front line but again only found success in Game Two, going 3/2/18 on Trundle.

Xiaohu: Fearlessly starts fights he knows his team will finish

Name: Li ""Xiaohu"" Yuan-Hao

Team: Royal Never Give Up

Update: Xiaohu, in a complete departure from his style earlier today, took up Lissandra, earning a 3/1/11 KDA while getting RNG the fights they wanted.

Analysis: In a complete 180 from his performance earlier today, Xiaohu decided to bring Lissandra in the first game, favoring a more engage-heavy style after his Corki was picked away. The pick proved fortituous for RNG, as Ever opted into an incredibly fragile composition who had few that could survive the full burst of Xiaohu, and that had few ways to lock her down. Each fight throughout the game saw Xiaohu get multiple key CC's off while zoning Ever out of the fight.

By the time the game was drawing to a close, Ever was afraid even to pass by him while he was locked away in Zhonya's hourglass, only too aware of the grisly end that would await them were they to get too close. While Xiaohu might not have earned the most impressive looking score in the game, it was his zoning and initiation that allowed his allies to carry the fight, making him a key link in their success.

Xiaohu: Leads the team in kills after victory over Origen

Name: Li ""Xiaohu"" Yuan-Hao

Team: Royal Never Give Up

Update: Xiaohu showed up with his Corki pick, one he has become well known for in his native China, posting an admirable 7/1/5 KDA on his way to blowing Origen out of the water.

Analysis: RNG's first game on the stage managed to both highlight their strengths and weaknesses simultaneously. While their trademark aggression pulled them through in the end, they also suffered ""the curse of China"", or failing to adapt to the styles of international opponents. The early lane swap favored Origen heavily, as RNG was slow to react. That had little effect on Xiaohu, though, who fearlessly faced off against PowerOfEvil's Leblanc as if he were on even footing, constantly forcing aggressive trades. He even forsook the traditional first purchase, Hexdrinker, that Corki players favor in the matchup, instead opting for the pure damage that a Sheen offered.

One certainly can't argue with the results he found, though, as his burst combined with mlxg's initiation ability was key to RNG's efforts in wresting control of the game. His pressure over mid lane was so great that he even found the opportunity to roam the map and assist the side lanes, a feat nearly unheard of in this matchup. While RNG might have made missteps in this game as a whole, it's hard to fault Xiaohu directly for them, his role being the most isolated from the early game where the mistakes were made. Considering his amazing performance even while behind, veteran LPL viewers will be excited to see how far this up and coming talent can go in a tournament filled with some of the greatest mid laners in the world, including the reigning world champion, Faker.

mIxg: Dismantles Origens composition with spectacular Gragas play

Name: Liu ""mlxg"" Shi-yu

Team: Royal Never Give Up

Update: mlxg punished Origen's reliance on Kog'maw as a damage source, constantly pressuring him out of dealing damage while taking a win with a 3/1/9 KDA.

Analysis: A big question heading into this event was whether China would adapt to the strategies that their opponents would field, as their region is notorious for bring both insular and slow to adapt. Many of those fears proved founded in RNG's first game, as Origen started the game with a considerable gold lead just due to their slow play in the laneswap. That didn't slow down RNG's ace rookie jungler, however, who joined Mata in forming a death squad with one target: sOAZ. The beleaguered Frenchman found no reprieve throughout the game, as every overextension was immediately punished by death.

As the game wore on, though, mlxg seamlessly transisitoned into a different role, one with a new target: Zven. Throughout the few teamfights that this game features, Zven never found the opening he needed in order to bring Kog'Maw's full damage potential to bear. Every time he tried mlxg was there, forcing him to once again reposition. Overall, while the game wasn't as dominant a showing from RNG as many might have expected, they showed a level of tenacity that veteran LPL viewers have come to expect from them, always managing to find the fights that would allow them to take back the game

Looper: Upstages sOAZ as the split push king

Name: Jang ""Looper"" Hyeong-seok

Team: Royal Never Give Up

Update: Looper ran away with a lane advantage against sOAZ, pressuring Origen from whatever lane he was in on his way to a 2/1/5 KDA.

Analysis: For fans of the LPL, the beginning of this game was like a nightmare come true. Time and again have Chinese teams traveled to international competitions, only to fail utterly due to a lack of adaptation to the opponents they faced there. While this game would not end in failure for RNG, the early laneswap was all but catastrophic for them. Looper, however, would be instrumental in reversing that gold deficit, as his pressure of sOAZ kept Origen from ever being in a position to really capitalize on their gold lead, especially due to their unorthodox composition that had few answers to the incredible waveclear that a Corki and Ezreal can bring to the table.

Along with the rest of his team, Looper looked to punish sOAZ's tendency for greedy plays, and punish it they did, with sOAZ failing to find a kill the entire game and earning most of his six deaths alone in the side lane. Overall, while the game wasn't as dominant a showing from RNG as many might have expected, they showed a level of tenacity that veteran LPL viewers have come to expect from them, always managing to find the fights that would allow them to take back the game.

KeY: Faux-tank can't front line for Ever

Name: Han-gi ""KeY"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Key ended Game Three of IEM Katowice with a 0/4/4 KDA on Braum.

Analysis: Key initiated a lane swap early and helped to fast push down the top tier one tower. He was able to pick up two assists in the game's first team fight and used his shield well to block poke damage early on. Unfortunately, he was looked to as the front line tank for Ever and just wasn't ever tanky enough to sustain damage in team fights. Once he was killed, Ever lacked any front line presence and RNG destroyed their squishy lineup.

LoKeN: Unable to take over Game Three

Name: Lee ""LoKeN"" Dong-Wook

Team: Ever

Update: Loken finished Game Three of IEM Katowice with a 2/3/2 KDA on Ezreal.

Analysis: Ever had an eye for the late game but RNG never let them get there. Loken initiated a lane swap early and fast pushed down the tier one tower. Like the rest of his team he attempted to farm through the early and mid game to pick up items and scale up. Despite being able to pick up a kill and an assist in the first team fight of the game, he was killed quickly in team fights as RNG rolled through Ever's squishy lineup.

Tempt: Dominated in team fights

Name: Kang ""Tempt"" Myung-Gu

Team: Ever

Update: Tempt finished Game Three of IEM Katowice with a 1/3/3 KDA as Corki.

Analysis: Despite farming well and keeping xiaohu in check on Lissandra, Tempt struggled to take over the game in any way. He stayed even in lane and had an eye on scaling for the late game, but RNG never let him get there. He picked up his only kill and an assist in the games first team fight but could only manage two more assists the rest of the game as RNG dominated in 5-vs-5 fights.

Ares: Can't provide the damage to win fights

Name: Min-kwon ""Ares"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Ares ended Game Three of IEM Katowice with a 0/3/2 KDA as Graves.

Analysis: Ares farmed much better early on in this game compared to game one but lost map control and objective control to mlxg. He was able to pick up two assists, but really couldn't consistently deal damage in team fights to help Ever win the game. With no real front line and three AD Carry champions in their roster, you have to wonder if a tank jungler or top laner would've helped Ever more.

Crazy: Unique champion doesn't pay off

Name: Jah-hee ""Crazy"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Crazy finished Game Three of IEM Katowice with a 3/4/0 KDA on Vladimir.

Analysis: A weird pick for Crazy that didn't quite pay off. He helped fast push the top tier one early but gave away first blood after falling victim to a five man gank in the top lane. This caused him to fall well behind Looper in their top lane matchup, having a 45 CS deficit at sixteen minutes. He was able to pick up a few kills, but he couldn't stop Looper from split pushing and didn't deal enough area-of-effect damage in team fights to win the game.

Mithy: Good start doesn't translate into late game success

Name: Alfonso ""Mithy"" Aguirre Rodriguez

Team: Origen

Update: Mithy ended Game Two of IEM Katowice with a 0/2/3 KDA as Thresh.

Analysis: A good start as he helped fast push both side lane tier one towers and the bottom tier two towers in the first eight minutes. He was able to use his hooks well to engage in team fights, but Origen lacked the necessary damage to instantly kill anyone he landed a hook on. As Origen was dominated in team fights he struggled to really provide enough CC to help his team turn the tide.

Zven: Shut down by RNG

Name: Jesper ""Zven"" Svenningsen

Team: Origen

Update: Zven finished Game Two of IEM Katowice with a 2/4/2 KDA on Kog'maw.

Analysis: Things looked good for the marksman early on as he fast pushed both side lane tier one towers and the bottom tier two tower in the first eight minutes of the game. He was able to roam the map early as he farmed, pressuring towers and running RNG around the map. Once RNG began to force team fights, things changed, as they focused Zven and killed him quickly in fights. Despite picking up a double kill in the second team fight of the game, Origen could not consistently peel for Zven and allow him to deal the necessary damage to turn fights in their favor.

PowerOfEvil: Struggles to effect game in any way

Name: Tristan ""PowerOfEvil"" Schrage

Team: Origen

Update: PowerOfEvil finished OG's Game Two loss at IEM Katowice with a 0/2/0 KDA on Leblanc.

Analysis: Despite farming even early on and looking to bully xiaohu, PowerOfEvil really could not do anything to help Origen win this game. In team fights he attempted to deal damage but couldn't find any opportunities to assassinate the RNG carries. Overall it was an anonymous game for the Origen mid laner.

Amazing: Can't create enough map pressure

Name: Maurice ""Amazing"" Stuckenschneider

Team: Origen

Update: Amazing ended Game Two of IEM Katowice with a 2/2/1 KDA on Elise.

Analysis: Things looked all right early on for Origen and Amazing as he farmed strongly and was able to pick up the Rift Herald buff to pressure down the bottom tier two tower early. Problems came for the OG jungler: he couldn't gank for his laners with Origen looking to focus on objectives over team fighting. It turned out the objective play was for good reason as RNG dominated team fights leaving Amazing struggling to provide any help.

sOAZ: Gives away easy kills

Name: Paul ""sOAZ"" Boyer

Team: Origen

Update: sOAZ finished Game Two of IEM Katowice with a 0/6/2 KDA as Nautilus.

Analysis: Another poor performance from sOAZ as his suspect positioning led to a lot of deaths. Early on he helped to fast push the bottom tier one tower before going to the top lane to farm. When he arrived in the top lane he overextended and was caught out to give away first blood. A little further into the game he was caught overextending in the bottom lane to give up a second easy kill. He couldn't effectively set up kills or provide a front line presence for Origen, and they were dominated in team fights.

KeY: Shows off his skills on Bard

Name: Han-gi ""KeY"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Key ended Game One at IEM Katowice with a 2/4/13 KDA on Bard.

Analysis: Although Ever fell way behind early, Key looked very good all game long playing the champion he's made his name on. Despite being bullied in the 2-vs-2 lane and giving away a kill to Yellowstar, Key and Loken were the main factor keeping Ever in the game early. He was able to set up kills using his ultimate to create picks and hitting multiple two man Cosmic Bindings that helped ever win 5-vs-5 fights even with a huge gold differential in favor of TSM.

LoKeN: Carries Ever to huge comeback victory

Name: Lee ""LoKeN"" Dong-Wook

Team: Ever

Update: Loken finished Game One of IEM Katowice with a 7/3/6 KDA on Lucian.

Analysis: Despite being bullied in the 2-vs-2 lane by TSM and falling behind in CS, Loken played well throughout the game. It looked like it was going to be a very one sided affair early as he was killed during a five man gank in the top lane, but once Ever started to 5-vs-5 they found some success. Loken's huge damage on Lucian helped to carry Ever in team fights as his team was able to set up kills for their marksman to capitalize on.

Tempt: Helps lead comeback despite poor early game

Name: Kang ""Tempt"" Myung-Gu

Team: Ever

Update: Tempt finished Ever's IEM Katowice Game One win with a 3/4/12 KDA on Twisted Fate.

Analysis: Tempt was a huge part of Ever's surprising comeback in this one. He fell behind early in this one attempting to roam, but was killed during a 3-vs-3 fight in the bottom lane. Ever gave away three kills without being able to pick one up for themselves, and moments later Tempt was killed during a TSM five man gank in the top lane.

Tempt was able to keep the faith however and claimed Ever's first kill in the game's first 5-vs-5 fight. As Ever started to come back, he was able to use his Gold Card in combination with his team's crowd control abilities and picked up a huge double kill in the final team fight of the game.

Ares: Struggles with his positioning

Name: Min-kwon ""Ares"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Ares ended Game One of IEM Katowice with a 1/6/4 KDA.

Analysis: Despite the big comeback win for Ever, this was an ugly game for Ares. He farmed early, invading the TSM jungle to take camps but failed a bottom lane dive that led to Ever giving away three kills without claiming one for themselves. His positioning was poor in this game, getting caught out of position to give away kills, and being in the front line during team fights to get killed early in every team fight.

Crazy: Name defines Game One

Name: Jah-hee ""Crazy"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Crazy finished Game One of IEM Katowice with a 3/6/8 KDA on Nautilus.

Analysis: This was a crazy game and an exciting way to kick off the tournament. It looked pretty bleak for both Crazy and Ever early on, and he was caught out of position to give away first blood in the game's first minute. Things got worse from there as he was killed in a 3-vs-3 fight in the bottom lane and couldn't provide a good front line tank early on in the game. As Ever started to come back, he used his ultimate and hook well to set up kills and once he got tanky, he helped Ever win team fights and eventually the game.

MARCH 3, 2016

FORG1VEN: Will remain with H2K-Gaming

Name: Konstantinos ""FORG1VEN"" Tzortziou

Team: H2K-Gaming

Update: FORG1VEN will remain with H2K-Gaming after he was granted a temporary deferment of military service.

Analysis: This is terrific news for both the team and FORG1VEN, as the club is currently tied atop the EU LCS standings with just two weeks left to play. While the Greek ADC has had a well-documented string of misfortune throughout his career, this bit of good news should allow for him to maintain his dominance over the competition for at least the Spring Split. He's currently fourth in the EU LCS in KDA (6.8) and is tied for fifth in the league in kills (52).

H2K will battle Team ROCCAT and Origen next week, the latter of which is expected to be the most bitter match left before playoffs. With FORG1VEN back on the roster and a week of rest and practice ahead of them, it should give H2K the best possible chances of earning the victory.

Sonstar: Replaces Adryh as Giants marksman

Name: Son ""S0NSTAR"" Seung-ik

Team: Giants Gaming

Update: Giants Gaming have announced Sonstar will take over as their AD Carry for the remainder of the Split.

Analysis: S0NSTAR replaces the disappointing Adryh in Giants lineup and will look to provide the spark that keeps them in the European top flight league next split. S0NSTAR joins after playing for South Korea's Incredible Miracle last split, playing in nine games while compiling a 34/21/45 KDA. Giants will hope their revamped lineup can save them from relegation and look to finish the Spring Split on a high note.

Wisdom: Takes over as new jungler

Name: Kim ""Wisdom"" Tae-wan

Team: Giants Gaming

Update: Wisdom will join Giants Gaming and take over as the new jungler, the team confirmed Monday.

Analysis: Wisdom, a 2015 World Championship runner-up with the KOO Tigers, will take over for betongjocke as the new jungler on Giants Gaming. He'll join former Incredible Miracle teammate S0NSTAR as the club looks to avoid relegation. They have a tough task in front of them, with games against Fnatic, G2 Esports, Origen and ROCCAT still on the docket.

Smittyj: Will become new top laner

Name: Lennart ""Smittyj"" Warkus

Team: Giants Gaming

Update: Smittyj will take over top lane duties for Giants Gaming, the team confirmed Monday.

Analysis: Giants Gaming made wholesale changes to their roster Monday, opting to release Atom, betongjocke and Adryh in an effort to maintain their spot in the EU LCS. While fans of Team Dignitas may recognize Smittyj after his one week performance with the North American club, ""disciplinary issues"" relegated the top laner to the bench for most of the Spring Split. However after a thorough study of his past history, Giants deemed the issue an ""isolated case"" and will look for their new roster to carry them out of the EU LCS cellar.

Adryh: Released by Giants

Name: Adrian ""Adryh"" Perez

Team: Giants Gaming

Update: In a surprising move, Giants opted to release long-time ADC Adryh on Monday.

Analysis: As part of a wholesale change that saw three of the five Giants members released Monday, Adryh will now hit the free agent market after a two-year stint with the team. While Giants may consider him a ""legend of their club"" he's been a bit of a disappointment this season, posting the lowest KDA (2.1) of any ADC to play 14 games. Still, considering his age (19) and his relatively pristine standing with his former team, there is certainly a chance Adryh could return to the LCS at some point in the future.

betongJocke: Let go by Giants

Name: Joachim ""betongJocke"" Rasmussen

Team: Giants Gaming

Update: betongjocke has been relieved of his duties by Giants, the team confirmed Monday.

Analysis: Along with rookie top laner Atom and Giants veteran Adryh, the team opted to release betongJocke in an attempt to salvage their spot in the EU LCS after what has amounted to a dismal season for the European club. In 10 games betongjocke tallied just nine kills compared to 39 deaths, putting forth a minuscule 1.3 KDA. He will be replaced by Wisdom, formerly of the KOO Tigers as the newly reformed Giants face their daunting remaining schedule, including games against Fnatic, G2 Esports, Origen and ROCCAT to round out the season.

Atom: Released by Giants

Name: Peter ""Atom"" Thomsen

Team: Giants Gaming

Update: Atom has been released by Giants, the team confirmed Monday.

Analysis: With Giants desperately trying to maintain their spot in the EU LCS, the club opted to make sweeping changes to the roster Monday, releasing three players including Atom. The rookie top laner had a disappointing start to his LCS career, ranking dead last in the league in KDA when factoring in games played, as well as leading his postion in deaths with 48. Smittyj will take over at top lane as the team attempts to crawl out of the cellar with just four games left on the schedule.

FEB. 28, 2016

Crumbzz: Another strong start turns to loss

Name: Alberto ""Crumbzz"" Rengifo

Team: Renegades

Update: Crumbzz's early kill was his only and finished with a 1/2/0 KDA on Rek'Sai against NRG on Saturday.

Analysis: Crumbzz punished KonKwon for wandering into his jungle by himself but couldn't find a kill or assists for the rest of the game. He and Renegades have had strong starts in a lot of their losses but couldn't keep their leads late and lost. That pattern continued in this game, Renegades had a team gold advantage for most of the game but slowly gave up team objectives to let NRG get back into the game and win. Crumbzz couldn't get strong engages to stop NRG from pushing, and NRG dominated the late game fights. Renegades are going to have to start pressuring the opposing team more after getting their early leads if they want to keep it late game and win.

Freeze: Makes early invade, can't hold lead late

Name: Ales ""Freeze"" Knezinek

Team: Renegades

Update: Freeze drew first blood but couldn't make plays late and finished with a 1/2/0 KDA on Kalista Saturday.

Analysis: Renegades had strong starts in almost all of their games, and this game was no exception. Freeze made an early invade to get his team first blood on Moon but that was his only kill of the game. In late game fights he and Renegades couldn't find a good engage on NRG and were slowly pushed off team objectives and back into their base. Freeze's front line engagers got taken down too quickly in fights for him to be able to deal out much damage and ended with a pretty low damage dealt to champions. He's going to have to find ways to deal out more damage if Renegades wants to win games and climb from the bottom of the standings.

Impact: 100 percent kill participation in win

Name: Jung ""Impact"" Eon-yeong

Team: NRG eSports

Update: Impact and NRG overcome their slow start and come back late and get the win on Saturday.

Analysis: Impact finished with a 1/0/6 KDA on Poppy and had a 100 percent kill participation. He was one of three people on NRG to finish with 100 percent kill participation, which speaks to how well they were able to work as a team this game. Impact was in the front line to use Poppy's steadfast presence to stop Crumbz from diving into NRG's back line, which took away one of Renegades only fight engaging tools. His stats have been pretty consistent all split, and he always makes up for his low kill count with a lot of assists. If Impact continues to play those tanky top lane champions, his stats most likely won't deviate from the pattern.

GBM: Great team synergy against Renegades

Name: Lee ""GBM"" Chang-suk

Team: NRG eSports

Update: GBM finished with a perfect 0/0/7 KDA on Zilean and 100 percent kill participation Saturday against Renegades.

Analysis: GBM fell behind to AlexIch early but was able to get a small victory in lane by knocking down his tower first. All of NRG had a kind of slow start, and they were able to comeback by grouping to get team objectives and dominate team fights. GBM used Zilean's ult to stop his teammates from dying, which starved Renegades of kills in the late game. GBM also had the second most damage dealt to champions on NRG. He wasn't able to get any kills from all the damage he dealt, but Zilean is more of a support champion that gets played in the mid lane. If he starts playing assassins or other casters in the mid lane his kill counts will probably go up.

Moon: Tanks for team, keeps deaths to minimum

Name: Galen ""Moon"" Holgate

Team: NRG eSports

Update: Moon got taken down for first blood, but it was his only death in the game. He finished with a 2/1/5 KDA on Elise Saturday against Renegades.

Analysis: Despite having another front line tank in their lineup, Moon finished the game with the most damage taken on NRG. Absorbing a lot of damage can lead to high number of deaths, but GBM was able to save Moon with Zilean's ult multiple times to keep his deaths low. NRG was able to put together a lot of winning team fights and worked together very well throughout the mid and late game to make a comeback. Moon was one of three plays to finish with 100 percent kill participation on NRG. If they will need to keep putting together games like this against some of the top teams to stay in the top six teams.

KonKwon: Makes an early mistake, overcomes late to get win

Name: Kevin ""KonKwon"" Kwon

Team: NRG eSports

Update: KonKwon died early, but it was his only death of the game and finished with a 0/1/6 KDA on Janna Saturday.

Analysis: KonKwon wandered into Crumbzz's jungle by himself and gave him a kill, but that was arguably his only misplay of the game. He and NRG overcame their early deaths by winning all team fights in the mid and late game, which allowed them to come back and win the game. KonKown helped his team protect Lod to let him be their damage carry. The early death could've been avoided but, KonKwon still finished the game with solid support stats. It's not clear how long Lod will be stepping in for Altec, but he and KonKown seemed to work well together this game. Hopefully they can continue their solid play on Sunday against Team Impulse.

LOD: Finishes with perfect KDA in first game for NRG

Name: Benjamin ""LOD"" deMunck

Team: NRG eSports

Update: Lod had a slow start but was a damage dealing monster in the late game and finished with a 4/0/2 KDA on Kog'Maw Saturday against Renegades.

Analysis: Altec stepped down early last week, and Lod took his spot on NRG's line up for this week. Lod had a great first game and finished with a perfect KDA and was NRG's top damage dealer. NRG did a great job at protecting Lod in fights, which allowed him to be a damage dealing monster in team fights. NRG didn't seem to lose much team synergy with the substitute AD carry, and Lod will look to get them another win Sunday against another bottom team, Team Impulse.

Feng: Engages lead to victory

Name: Wang ""Feng"" Xiao Feng

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Feng was great at setting up kills for his team and finished with a 2/3/9 KDA on Nautilus against NRG eSports.

Analysis: The game started with lane swaps leaving the top lane match up pretty even. However, Impact got taken down for first blood, and Feng was able to start building a gold lead over him. TIP took over the second half of the game and dominated team objectives and team fights. Feng's role was to be a front line tank and engage in fights, and he played his role well this game. He was great at setting up kills with Nautilus's ult and harassing the damage dealers, which allowed the rest of his team to clean up in team fights. Feng and his teammates interrupted NRG attempting to get Baron Nashor and got the buff and wiped out most of NRG -- which pretty much won them the game.

Procxin: Bounces back against NRG eSports

Name: Kim ""Procxin"" Seyoung

Team: Team Impulse

Update:Procxin had a solid game on Nidalee and finished with a 3/1/7 KDA.

Analysis:Procxin and TIP were great at controlling the neutral team objectives against NRG. They were able to get a Rift Herald, four dragons, and a Baron Nashor -- while NRG only managed to get one dragon buff during the match. In team fights Procxin was great at soaking up and dealing damage for TIP, and he participated in all but five kills for TIP. This was a solid game for Procxin and TIP after their poor performance on Saturday.

Pirean: Main damage dealer in win

Name: Choi ""Pirean"" Jun-Sik

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Pirean had a close match up in lane but was able to pull out a victory against NRG eSports and finished with a 5/1/8 KDA on Viktor.

Analysis: Pirean and GBM were close for the entire game and even finished with similar stat lines. However, TIP was able to win a lot more team fights and dominated the neutral team objectives. In team fights Pirean was able to tear through the frontline tanks to open up the damage dealers in the back, which either forced a retreat or got his team kills. He finished the game with most damage dealt on TIP and tied for the highest kill participation with Mash. Pirean will have to put together more solid games like this for TIP to climb into the top six teams by the end of the split.

Mash: Doesn't have to hard carry in win

Name: Brandon ""Mash"" Phan

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Mash stayed even in lane and was still a big contributor late game as he finished with a 4/1/9 KDA on Kalista.

Analysis: Lane swaps early meant Mash didn't have to go through the traditional laning phase (which may have been a blessing this game). He and Lod stayed pretty close in gold most the game, but Mash pulled away late when TIP started dominating team fights. Mash was only the third most damage dealt to champions but tied for the highest kill participation. His only death came when he and TIP were overextended, and it didn't hurt much more than his stats. This was a good win for TIP in the standings, but the rest of the split they will go up against more teams at the top -- which will be a big challenge for them.

Gate: Has solid outing against NRG eSports

Name: Austin ""Gate"" Yu

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Gate set up multiple kills with Bard's ult and finished with a 1/2/9 KDA against NRG eSports.

Analysis: Gate looked much better on Bard in Sunday's game and finished with a better KDA than he did on Saturday. His Bard ult's were on point and got his team kills and himself a lot of assists. TIP avoided early mistakes this game and were able to take full control after securing their first Baron Nashor buff of the game. The rest of their schedule is pretty tough, and they will have to beat some top teams if they want into the playoffs.

Impact: Starved of CS early, can't come back

Name: Jung ""Impact"" Eon-yeong

Team: NRG eSports

Update: Impact had a slow start and couldn't overcome it, finishing the game with a 0/3/6 KDA on Tahm Kench.

Analysis: Early lane swaps and dying for first blood put Impact behind in lane as he was only able to get 14 CS in the first ten minutes of the game. He managed to get back into the game by picking up some assists, but the crowd control on TIP proved to be too much for him, and it cost him some deaths. Impact wasn't able to get to TIP's damage dealers during team fights to set up kills for the rest of his team. Instead, during fights he was forced to attempt to save his teammates from TIP and maybe pick up an assist when his team took down a member of TIP. He still managed to get a decent amount of assists, but he usually is able to pick up at least a kill per game. He was targeted in during bans, and he was forced off Poppy, who he has had some of his best games on this split, which teams might try against NRG again.

Moon: Has lackluster game on Gragas in loss

Name: Galen ""Moon"" Holgate

Team: NRG eSports

Update: Moon couldn't put together a winning team fight with his team and finished with a 0/3/5 KDA on Gragas.

Analysis: Moon took a lot of damage against TIP but couldn't return it. He was one of NRG's frontline tank and got chunked down too early in fights for him to help his team turn them around. Being chunked down early in fights also forced Moon to use Gragas's ult to disengage rather than to try and separate and pick off a member of TIP. He still manage a decent kill participation but it wasn't much since his team had a difficult time picking up kills this game.

GBM: Can't carry against Team Impulse

Name: Lee ""GBM"" Chang-suk

Team: NRG eSports

Update: GBM was NRG eSports' carry against Team Impulse but he couldn't do enough to get the win and finished with a 5/1/3 KDA on Orianna.

Analysis: GBM had the best overall stats for NRG in their loss Sunday. He finished with the second most damage dealt to champs, highest kill participation and most kills, but all of that couldn't stop TIP from winning the game. While he and NRG were able to pick up kills throughout the game, they couldn't win a team fight late to stop TIP from pushing and lost all hope of a comeback when they failed to get Baron Nashor late. GBM has been NRG's best player for most of the split, but he will have to find ways to pick up his teammates play for them to maintain a spot among the top six teams.

LOD: Can't repeat success on Kog'Maw in loss

Name: Benjamin ""LOD"" deMunck

Team: NRG eSports

Update: Lod was able to get a power pick in Kog'Maw but failed to put up a good game and finished with a 3/4/3 KDA.

Analysis: Lod wasn't able to get the protection from his team that he had on Saturday, and it showed in his stats. He still managed to deal out the most damage to champs despite having the most deaths on the team. TIP was able to force fights with NRG's flank open, which allowed TIP to harass and take him down or force him out of the fight. It's unclear whether Lod will be returning next week for NRG but it would be nice for them to not have to find another AD carry. If he continues on he and KonKown can hopefully build some synergy and keep their spot among the top six teams in the standings.

KonKwon: Can't disengage Team Impulse in fights

Name: Kevin ""KonKwon"" Kwon

Team: NRG eSports

Update: KonKwon finished wtih a 0/5/4 KDA on Janna in loss to Team Impulse.

Analysis: KonKwon had a lot of deaths and not much to show for it in Saturday's loss to Team Impulse. Team Impulse seemed to have more engaging utility than KonKwon could handle and finished with the most deaths on the team. He and NRG couldn't get a favorable team fight late game, and it forced them to make a risky call to get Baron Nashor. The call backfired and put TIP in full control of the game. KonKwon and Lod didn't have the kind of success that they did together on Saturday, but if Lod sticks around, and they play more games together, their synergy should improve.

Balls: Falls behind early, can't stop split push late

Name: An ""Balls"" Le

Team: Cloud9

Update: Balls had a rough game against Counter Logic Gaming and finished with a lowly 1/7/9 KDA on Lulu.

Analysis: Balls was taken down early by Darshan and Xmithie and fell behind in lane. Balls wasn't able to make a comeback in lane and stayed behind Darshan for the rest of the game. The set back was too much for him to be able to stop Darshan's split push alone and it cost them a inhibitor tower. Things were still in C9 favor when they got a Baron Nashor buff late but they weren't able to get more than a tower before CLG broke up their siege and wiped out all of C9. The death timers were too long and CLG's ensuing push knocked down two inhibitors and C9 couldn't come back from that. Balls might want to rethink playing Lulu in the top lane after this game and stick to his tanky bruisers like Darius.

Rush: Slow on the draw against Counter Logic Gaming, can't get early lead

Name: Lee ""Rush"" Yoonjae

Team: Cloud9

Update: Rush lost a close game to Counter Logic Gaming and finished with a 6/4/7 KDA on Lee Sin.

Analysis: While Rush is known to make aggressive plays early, we didn't see that Sunday against CLG. He was still good in teamfights and managed to pick up a good amount of kills and assists for C9 but wasn't able to get the early lead that he usually does. Rush ended the game with most damage taken but kept his deaths low because of Lee Sin's ability to shield himself and mobility to jump out of fights when he's close to death. The game seemed to be turning in Rush and C9 favor until their Baron empowered siege was interrupted by a Bard ult and they got wiped out in the following team fight. CLG was able to knock down a tower and two inhibitors because of C9's long death timers and it was too much for them to come back from.

Jensen: Solid performance in loss to Counter Logic Gaming

Name: Nicolaj ""Jensen"" Jensen

Team: Cloud9

Update: Jensen stayed close in lane but couldn't make the plays late game to get Cloud 9 a win.

Analysis: Jensen finished with a solid 6/4/10 KDA on LeBlanc in a loss to CLG. His laning phase was pretty even and stayed close in gold with Huhi for the entire game. In team fights Jensen was one of C9's top damage dealers and he finished with the second highest kill participation. However he was taken out early in the crucial team fight late and wasn't able to deal out much damage before dying. The long death timers let CLG knock down a tower and two inhibitors to take control of the game. C9 wasn't able to come back and died trying to defend the Nexus.

Sneaky: Can't hard carry Cloud9 to victory against Counter Logic Gaming

Name: Zachary ""Sneaky"" Scuderi

Team: Cloud9

Update: Sneaky had very good game against Counter Logic Gaming but fell short in the late game.

Analysis: Sneaky finished with a 10/2/3 KDA on Lucian in a loss to CLG on Sunday. He had the best KDA and dealt the most damage on C9 but he couldn't carry hard enough late game to get the win. Sneaky's front line protectors got torn through in a late game team fight which resulted in him and his teammates got wiped out. CLG was able to break open C9's base afterwards and C9 couldn't do anything to stop them from winning the game.

Hai: Comeback falls short in loss to Counter Logic Gaming

Name: Hai ""Hai"" Lam

Team: Cloud9

Update: Hai set up kills for his team but dies early in an late game team fight that cost Cloud9 the game.

Analysis: Hai finished with a 0/5/10 KDA on Alistar in a tough loss to CLG on sunday. He and Cloud9 got a Baron Nashor buff late game and were trying to siege their way in CLG's base but an ult from Bard stop the siege and allowed CLG to almost ace C9. Hai got blown early in the fight and couldn't protect C9's damage dealers from CLG. He had a decent amount of assists but couldn't set up the team fights late for his team.

Darshan: Got an early lead, became a split push threat late

Name: Darshan ""Darshan"" Upadhyaha

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Darshan's success on split pushing top laners continued against Cloud9.

Analysis: Darshan got help from Xmithie to get first blood on Balls and slowly grew a gold lead the rest of the game. He spent a lot of the game split pushing and got all the way to an inhibitor by himself. Balls wasn't enough to stop him alone and Jensen had to come help. However he was too late and Darshan had already exposed one of their inhibitors. Darshan dying to Jensen let C9 get a Baron Nashor buff but couldn't get much out of it. They were only able to knock down a tower before CLG was broke up their siege. Darshan was able to pick up a kill and some assists in the team fight but it cost him his life. However he was the lone death on CLG while almost all of C9 were killed. CLG rushed down middle lane to knock down a tower and two inhibitors and take control of the game. Darshan finished with the most deaths on CLG but a lot of those deaths came with kills or assists. He and CLG's split push strategy came up big this week against two very good teams and pushed them into second place in the standings.

Xmithie: Fed Darshan early and it paid off with victory

Name: Jake ""Xmithie"" Puchero

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Xmithie made multiple early ganks for Darshan to get him a lead in lane and make him a split pushing nuisance.

Analysis: Xmithie finished with a 2/4/14 KDA on Udyr in their win over C9. He camped Darshan's lane early to get him first blood and helped him get an advantage in lane which paid off. Darshan was able to split push and expose one of C9's inhibitors without any assistance. To go along with Darshan's split push, Xmithie bought a Zz'Rot Portal to help keep pressure on other lanes. C9 mounted a bit of a comeback and got a Baron Nashor buff late game but CLG was able to break up their siege and almost ace them. From the near ace CLG was able to pick up a tower and two inhibitors which put them in control for the rest of the game.

Huhi: Helped hold off Cloud9 while Darshan split pushed

Name: Choi ""Huhi"" Jae-hyun

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Huhi was able to help buy time for Darshan to split push and get Counter Logic Gaming get the win.

Analysis: Huhi finished with a 8/5/9 KDA on Corki in a win over C9 on Sunday. The laning phase was pretty even for Huhi in the mid lane and he stayed close in gold to Jensen for the entire game. He finished with the most damage dealt to champions in the game but dealing out all that damage put him in dangerous situations that cost him his life. C9 was making a comeback with a Baron Nashor buff but CLG was able to break up their siege and traded four kills for one death. Huhi was among the survivors and led his team to knock down a tower and two inhibitors which C9 wasn't able to come back from.

Stixxay: Large contributor in win over Cloud9

Name: Trevor ""Stixxay"" Hayes

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Stixxay's solid game against Cloud9 got a him 5/3/12 KDA on Ezreal and a win.

Analysis: Stixxay was close in lane despite being taken out in an early skirmish. He was a threat in team fights and dealt the second most damage to champions for CLG while finishing with the second highest kill participation. He and Darshan were killed late in the game which allowed C9 to get a Baron Nashor buff and attempt a comeback. However CLG was able to break the siege and trade one death for four kills. The favorable trade late game let Stixxay and his teammates push down a tower and two inhibitors and take back control of the game. Stixxay bounced back nicely after having a poor game on Saturday but his kills were still kind of low. They have slightly easier competition next week so he could easily have a more productive week stat wise.

Aphromoo: Came up big with Bard's ult late to break Baron empowered siege

Name: Zaqueri ""Aphromoo"" Black

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Aphromoo's helped break up Cloud9's come back late to get his team to a perfect 2 - 0 Week 7.

Analysis: Aphromoo finished with a 1/4/17 KDA on Bard in a win over C9 on sunday. His high number of deaths was easy to accept because he had the highest kill participation for CLG. However the game was very close and C9 was able to secure a Baron Nashor buff late game and began to siege CLG's base. Aphromoo helped his team break up the siege by initiating a fight with Bard's ult which locked down two members of C9. With the numbers advantage CLG was able to clean up the fight,only having to trade one death for four kills and take control of the game. Aphromoo's Bard ult came up big in that late fight and it helped CLG pull out a win over C9.

FEB. 27, 2016

Gate: Laning failure kill hope for crucial victory

Name: Wang ""Austin ""Gate"" Yu

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Gate fell victim to a poor early lane exchange, setting the stage both for his team's defeat to Team Liquid, as well as an abysmal 0/5/3 KDA for himself.

Analysis: Within five minutes of the game starting, everything had fallen apart for Team Impulse. In the top lane, Procxin has suicided and turned a won lane for Feng into a nightmare. Not even a minute later, Gate and Mash engaged Team Liquid's bot lane in a 2v2, a fight they theoretically should have been advantaged in. Nevertheless, Liquid found a way to not only come out on top, but to kill Gate outright, leaving Mash to fall further behind alone. That was just the tip of the iceberg, though, as not long after the first full 5v5 of the game was fought, a fight that saw nearly every member of Team Impulse fall, Gate included.

While Impulse made a few more attempts to pull the lost game back, their engages were mixed at best, with multiple players extending too far forward on a regular basis. To make things worse for Gate, each of these fights saw him perish, and with it any hope for a decent KDA. Unsurprisingly, it's hard to recommend a player who went 0/5/3 for fantasy, and both Gate and his struggling team should be treated as radioactive by any owners who like winning.

Mash: Poor lane performance buries team

Name: Brandon ""Mash"" Phan

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Mash and Gate found themselves outmatched by Team Liquid's lane, with Mash earning a mere 3/3/0 KDA before the dust settled on his team's swift defeat.

Analysis: Within five minutes of the game starting, everything had fallen apart for Team Impulse. In the top lane, Procxin has suicided and turned a won lane for Feng into a nightmare. Not even a minute later, Gate and Mash engaged Team Liquid's bot lane in a 2v2, a fight they theoretically should have been advantaged in. Nevertheless, Liquid found a way to not only come out on top, but to kill Gate outright, leaving Mash to fall further behind alone. That was just the tip of the iceberg, though, as not long after the first full 5v5 of the game was fought, a fight that saw nearly every member of Team Impulse fall, Mash included.

Needless to say, falling this far behind a team with Kog'Maw on it at this stage of the game was devastating, and despite a few attempts at engages Impulse never managed to get anything done, as Mash's damage simply couldn't compare to his opposite's. While his score overall was far from terrible, the bar is set much higher for ADC players in fantasy, and as such he is a palyer most would be best off avoiding.

Pirean: Unable to find time to make an impact

Name: Choi ""Pirean"" Jun-Sik

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Pirean found himself glued to his turret, eventually earning a 0/2/2 KDA in a brutal loss to Team Liquid.

Analysis: Picking Twisted Fate is always a gamble on the competitive stage. The strength of the champion comes from how he augments the power of the other lanes, as he constantly threatens a lopsided fight thanks to his ultimate. This power is not without it's costs, however, as in return his pressure in his own lane is minimal. FeniX wasted no time taking advantage of this fact, as he bullied and pressure Pirean all lane long.

To make matters worse, by the time Pirean had access to his ultimate his lanes had already fell far behind, and his attempts to assist them only deepened the hole the team had collectively dug themselves. Needless to say from his record, they didn't climb out, and fantasy owners would be wise to leave them there.

Procxin: Early game suicide paves the road for easy defeat

Name: Kim ""Procxin"" Seyoung

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Procxin got bit hard by his aggressive tendencies in his loss to Team Liquid Saturday, ending 0/4/2 by the end of the game.

Analysis: Procxin's early tower dive unto Lourlo is the stuff highlight reels are made of. Unfortunately, though, Procxin is the one who comes out looking silly, as he dies after greedily over-committing, more or less dooming his team in the early game singlehandedly. By the end of the game, though, one could almost feel sorry for the guy, as he dies trying to finish of a nearly dead Lourlo on three separate occasions, each time throwing an even or advantageous skirmish for TiP. The fact he managed to die as many times as Feng's Malphite, who started out the game in a terrible position thanks to Procxin's suicide, is a testament to his lack of caution. If he's to earn a spot on any fantasy owner's roster, he'll need to find a level of consistency that simply seems beyond him and his team at this point.

Feng: Fails to initiate advantageous fights in loss

Name: Wang ""Feng"" Xiao Feng

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Feng finished with a 1/4/1 KDA in a loss to Team Liquid on Saturday.

Analysis: TiP drafted a composition that was made to do one thing: dive and dive hard. Unfortunately, the key synergy they were relying on was between Feng and Gate, as Tempered Fate should have easily led into an excellent unstoppable force. Unfortunately, that never happened in this game, and to make it worse Feng found himself stuck in lane against a double buffed Nautilus after a disastrous gank by Procxin. Frankly, Feng and his team shouldn't be in consideration for any fantasy owners at this point in the split. The few games they've managed to win were miraculous and still lacked the scorelines that would make them look attractive.

Cabochard: Supportive role sets up clean Vitality win

Name: Lucas ""Cabochard"" Simon-Meslet

Team: Vitality

Update: Cabochard ended Friday with a 0/0/10 KDA on Nautilus.

Analysis: Another supportive performance from Cabochard, but one that worked out well for his team. He was able to farm well early against Steve keeping the Elements top laner from mindlessly pushing in the top lane. With help from Shook, Cabo set up two successful dives on Steve picking up two assists early in the game. In the mid game he was constantly pushing in the side lines to help Vitality control the map and used his hook and ultimate to set up kills in team fights.

Shook: Aggressive early game helps him control the tempo

Name: Ilyas ""Shook"" Hartsema

Team: Vitality

Update: Shook finished Day Fourteen of the EULCS with a 4/1/4 KDA as Nidalee.

Analysis: Shook set the tone early on in this game, farming well and successfully diving Steve in the top lane twice for quick kills. With KaSing, he set up vision in the Elements side of the map throughout the game, giving Vitality control over the map. He combined the vision game with control of objectives such as Dragon and Rift Herald, while helping to take down towers.

Nukeduck: Dominates on the wings of Quinn

Name: Erlend ""Nukeduck"" Holm

Team: Vitality

Update: Nukeduck finished Vitality's Friday win with a 6/0/4 KDA on Quinn.

Analysis: One of the few Quinn mid lane players, Nukeduck is making the champion his own across both LCS regions. He farmed well early, bullying Eika and not allowing his opponent to consistently wave clear. He solo killed Eika in the mid game and picked up a second kill minutes later after Vitality set up a gank in the mid lane. From there he looked to split push down towers, using his ultimate to soar around the map quickly. In the final team fight of the game he picked up three kills, leading to the end of the game for Vitality.

Hjarnan: Power spike helps Vitality to dominate win

Name: Peter ""Hjarnan"" Freyschuss

Team: Vitality

Update: Hjarnan was unkillable Friday, posting a 4/0/5 KDA on Corki.

Analysis: Hjarnan let a farm heavy early game lead him into a big mid game power spike allowing Vitality to dominate Elements. He didn't pick up his first kill until the 18th minute, but from there he dealt huge damage in team fights as Vitality put a stranglehold on the game. He both poked well as Vitality sieged towers with Baron buff and punished Elements with burst damage when they tried to team fight.

KaSing: Controls the vision game in win

Name: Raymond ""KaSing"" Tsang

Team: Vitality

Update: KaSing ended Day Fourteen of the EULCS with a 0/2/7 KDA on Tahm Kench.

Analysis: Despite giving away first blood, KaSing enjoyed a successful game on Tahm Kench. He controlled the vision game with Shook to allow Vitality tons of map control as they took over the game from Elements. The vision control allowed him to make plays including flanking well with his ultimate to set up kills. KaSing was also able to keep his allies safe in team fights by using Devour to shield them from damage as elements won the game.

Gilius: Kept in check by Vitality

Name: Berk ""Gilius"" Demir

Team: Elements

Update: Gilius ended Friday's loss to Vitality with a 0/3/3 KDA on Gragas.

Analysis: Gilius was really smothered in this one and struggled to make any plays throughout the game. He farmed well early and was able to pick up an assist on first blood. Unfortunately that was his only shining moment as Vitality dominated objectives and strangled the life out of Elements. Gilius couldn't really make anything happen as Vitality dominated the map and team fights.

Hauntzer: First blood not big enough of anchor to weigh him down

Name: Kevin ""Hauntzer"" Yarnell

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Hauntzer got caught out early, but that was his only death and finished with a 0/1/11 KDA on Nautilus.

Analysis: Early lane swaps got Hauntzer an early gold lead despite giving up first blood to Hard. Hauntzer roamed a lot of the game which helped TSM keep the pressure on Echo Fox. He always seemed to find the right place to be at the right time to help his team win fights and finished with 100 percent kill participation. His lack of kills was because of how his champion fit into TSM's team composition. Nautilus is a tanky front line champion that is a fight engager and mainly sets up kills for teammates instead of taking them. The kills will come back if Hauntzer begins to play hyper carries in the top lane instead of tanks.

Bjergsen: Anhilates second half of game, finishes with perfect KDA

Name: Soren ""Bjergsen"" Bjerg

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Bjergsen dominated the second half of the game and finished with a 5/0/6 KDA on Orianna.

Analysis: Bjergsen was quiet in the early game and kept even with Froggen in damage trades and CS. When the team fights broke out Bjergsen came alive and was TSM's main damage dealer. He landed Orianna's ult on multiple people during team fights which made it an easy clean up for TSM. Bjergsen was able to farm and become a beast late game thanks to the rest of TSM keeping pressure on Echo Fox.

Svenskeren: Tanks his way to victory

Name: Dennis ""Svenskeren"" Johnsen

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Svenskeren was Team SoloMid's main tank in victory over Echo Fox and finished with a 3/1/5 KDA on Elise.

Analysis: Svenskeren took the most damage on TSM despite there being an Alistar and Nautilus in the line up. Even though he took the most damage, he managed to only die once, and it was during the team fight over first dragon. Taking so much damage made him run early from a few fights and miss out on some assists, but he was still a damage threat and dealt out the second most damage on TSM and participated in all but three of TSM's kills.

Doublelift: Executed by tower, not Echo Fox

Name: Yiliang ""Doublelift"" Peng

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Doublelift's only death came when he walked into tower range before his minions, but otherwise he put together a solid 3/1/7 KDA on Kalista in a win over Echo Fox.

Analysis: TSM was better at rotating during the lane swaps to start the game, which gave Doublelift an early gold lead that he was able to slowly grow for the rest of the game. He didn't have to hard carry his team in fights and only dealt the third most damage to champions on TSM. He could have finished without any deaths, but he mistakenly walked into tower range before his minions and couldn't get out of range before the tower killed him. This is a silly mistake for a professional to make however it didn't hurt anything but his stats.

Yell0wStaR: No deaths and ties for most assists over Echo Fox

Name: Bora ""Yell0wStaR"" Kim

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Yellowstar finished with a perfect KDA and 100 percent kill participation on Alistar in a win over Echo Fox.

Analysis: Yellowstar and Doublelift didn't have to deal with the traditional laning phase to start the game and took down their tower while Keith and Big took down top lane's. TSM were slightly ahead after the lane swap finished and then were able to keep the pressure on Echo Fox for the rest of the game. When team fighting began, Yellowstar earned assists by disrupting Echo Fox with head butts and pulverizes which earned him 100 percent kill participation.

KFO: Starves of CS early, can't rally late

Name: Park ""KFO"" Jeong-hun

Team: Echo Fox

Update: KFO made a sloppy lane swap, fell behind in gold early and couldn't come back. He finished with a 0/2/2 KDA on Malphite in a loss to Team SoloMid.

Analysis: KFO helped his team lane swap, but then was zoned off minion waves by Doublelift and Yellowstar which made him have a very slow start to the game. He got an assist on first blood when he helped Hard punish Hauntzer's over extension, however it wasn't enough to make up for his lack of CS. The constant pressure from TSM forced team fights that Echo Fox couldn't make the plays to win. KFO landed some good Malphite ults, but the rest of his team couldn't follow up on them, and TSM just keep pushing their way to victory.

Hard: Soaks up damage and kills in loss to Team SoloMid

Name: Anthony ""Hard"" Barkhovtsev

Team: Echo Fox

Update: Hard was a step behind in their loss to Team SoloMid and finished with a 2/2/0 KDA on Gragas.

Analysis: Hard was able draw first blood on Hauntzer, but it didn't make up for Echo Fox's early deficit. TSM dominated team fights, and Hard was forced to use Gragas' ult for a disengage instead of using it to try to pick someone off. He finished the game with all of Echo Fox's kills, which isn't wanted as his role should set up kills for his team instead of taking them. Hard did fulfill his role as tank though and finished with the most damage taken.

Froggen: Only close lane for Echo Fox, can't carry late

Name: Henrik ""Froggen"" Hansen

Team: Echo Fox

Update: Froggen picked Corki again but can't lead his team to victory and finished with a 0/2/1 KDA.

Analysis: Froggen tried to be the aggressor in lane but couldn't get an advantage over Bjergsen. They stayed pretty even in trades and CS, however Bjergsen made a bigger impact in team fights. Froggen wasn't able to get a good engage with his team and failed to win any team fights. TSM respected Corki's package and waited for Froggen to use it or for it to wear off before most of the team fights. While he was the lead damage dealer for Echo Fox, he couldn't get any kills. In past games Froggen had been able to get some early kills with Corki and win lane, but it didn't happen this time. He managed to keep lane close, but when all lanes lose on a team it is near impossible for them to win.

KEITH: Cannot overcome slow start

Name: Yuri ""KEITH"" Jew

Team: Echo Fox

Update: Keith fell behind early because of a sloppy lane swaps and finished with a poor KDA of 0/3/2 on Lucian.

Analysis: Keith was a superhero last week, but started off as a zero this week. He and Big were a step behind on lane swaps and started to fall behind early. In team fights, Keith was targeted early and taken down, which is why he finished with the most deaths on Echo Fox. The early setbacks also meant he was weak in team fights and couldn't deal out much damage before being taken down.

BIG: Failed in lane swap, can't help team late

Name: Terry ""BIG"" Chuong

Team: Echo Fox

Update: BIG fell behind early and couldn't rally with his team in the mid game and finished with a 0/2/2 KDA on Braum.

Analysis: BIG and Keith were slow to rotate to defend Doublelift and Yellowstar, ultimately falling behind early. When team fights were finally initiated in the mid game they weren't able to get a favorable engage on TSM and lost any chance of a comeback. It's really difficult for a support to put together good stats when his team loses and BIG is no exception. If Echo Fox wants a make a run in the playoffs they will need to learn to lane swap better.

Darshan: Split pushed to victory

Name: Darshan ""Darshan"" Upadhyaha

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Darshan got a lot of help from Xmithie to win his lane and split pushed his team to victory, finished with a 4/2/2 KDA on Fiora.

Analysis: Darshan got early ganks from Xmithie and started to build a gold lead in lane that he would keep for the rest of the game. The mid game had a lot of back-and-forth moments but CLG held on to a tower advantage and kept the pressure on IMT for the majority of the game. Darshan was able to split push with only Huni trying to stop him and it wasn't enough. So far Darshan is the only player to really take advantage of Huni's aggressive play and snowball a lead over him which might be the secret to defeating IMT.

Xmithie: Camped top lane early to keep Huni down

Name: Jake ""Xmithie"" Puchero

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Xmithie ganked Huni early and often to help feed Darshan and finished with a 2/1/4 KDA on Udyr.

Analysis: Xmithie spent the early game helping Darshan and it paid off later in the contest. He helped Darshan pick up a double kill on Huni and Reignover for first blood which led to Darshan winning his lane. Feeding Darshan early let him become the split pushing monster late game that brought IMT's win streak to an end. IMT had a chance to get their second Baron buff of the game and possibly stall the game to make a miraculous comeback, but Xmithie played the role of spoiler and stole the boost, sealing the victory for CLG.

Huhi: Strong mid game, falls off late

Name: Choi ""Huhi"" Jae-hyun

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Huhi capitalized on mistakes in the mid game which got him a 2/4/2 KDA on LeBlanc.

Analysis: Huhi stayed close in lane and had a strong mid game power spike but wasn't a big factor in the late game. He caught Wildturtle and Huni out of position for his only kills of the game. However, the tables turned late in the contest, as he was the one being caught out of position which allowed IMT to get a Baron Nashor buff and stall the game. He dealt the second most damage to champions on CLG but also had the most deaths. It",[]
espn.com,,Reaction to Team Czech Republic World Cup roster,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Dan Marrazza', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Sean Allen', 'John Buccigross', 'Sarah Goldstein', 'Scott Burnside', 'John Rosengren', 'Paul Grant']","The Czech entry in the World Cup of Hockey has an uphill battle ahead of it, to say the least, given a lack of depth along the blue line and in terms of offensive prowess.

And that hill might become even steeper pending the status of the legendary Jaromir Jagr, who was not among the initial list of 16 players who will take to the ice in Toronto in September.

In some ways, it isn't that surprising. After leading the Czech Republic in scoring at last spring's World Championships, the 44-year-old Jagr indicated that would be his final international competition.

But given that Jagr shows no signs of slowing down, leading the Florida Panthers to the top spot in the Atlantic Division this season, it's difficult to imagine the Czechs without him on the roster.

Of course, when you're one of the greatest players of all time, you're cut a little slack, and there's no doubt a roster spot awaits if Jagr decides that he's got enough in the tank for at least this tournament.

Editor's Picks World Cup of Hockey roster: Czech Republic The Czechs revealed somewhat of a surprise when they failed to name the legendary Jaromir Jagr to their 16-man squad.

One issue might be the fact that Jagr has not decided whether he will indeed retire after this season. He signed a one-year deal to stay with the Panthers for this season, and no decision on his NHL future has been made at this stage.

Czech GM Martin Rucinsky said that in a conversation last week with Jagr, the big winger made it clear he wanted to focus on the NHL stretch run and playoffs and asked not to be named among the first 16 players.

""Obviously, that's the only thing on his mind right now,"" Rucinsky said Wednesday during a conference call from Prague.

Rucinsky, a former NHLer, is hopeful that Jagr will eventually decide to join the team.

""He's a very important player for us, no doubt about it. Everybody knows that,"" Rucinsky said. ""He's a role model for young guys.""

Every time Jagr plays internationally, regardless of the tournament, he's one of the best -- if not the best -- players on the Czech team, Rucinsky said.

""He's a very important piece for our team,"" he said.

Beyond Jagr's omission, the fact that Jiri Hudler -- who was recently traded from Calgary to Jagr's Panthers -- was also absent from the initial 16 is a bit of a surprise, even if he is having an off season.

The Czechs also named two players currently in the Kontinental Hockey League -- 25-year-old defenseman Michal Kempny and former NHLer Vladimir Sobotka. They were named ahead of veteran defenseman Marek Zidlicky and forward Radim Vrbata, both of whom are longtime NHLers.",[]

espn.com,,USOC on Zika -- Athletes must decide whether to compete in Rio,"['Gordon Simpson', 'Sue Mott', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Bonnie D', 'Johnette Howard', 'Espn Staff', 'Adriana Terrazas']","BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. -- Once they get to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, American athletes could be faced with virus-spreading mosquitoes, virus-infested water and the prospect of competing against at least two countries, Russia and Kenya, that are under investigation for top-to-bottom doping conspiracies.

The U.S. Olympic Committee's stance on all that: Everything will be just fine.

Leaders of the federation that seeds the Olympics with more than 500 athletes, whose success helps bankroll the entire movement via an NBC contract worth $1.23 billion this year, sounded confident that systems in place on all three fronts will work as planned. They said calling for something drastic -- say, moving the Olympics or insisting the Russians don't compete in track -- isn't necessary.

""I think we have to recognize what our role is,"" CEO Scott Blackmun said Monday at the USOC Media Summit, where more than 100 Olympic hopefuls are appearing. ""We're one of 200 countries that participates in the Olympic Games. By definition, you have to have someone in charge of the overall project. Every single Games brings its own unique set of challenges that causes people to question whether the Games should've been awarded to X.""

Of course, every stance the USOC takes -- or doesn't take -- has to be measured against the backdrop of the Los Angeles bid for the 2024 Olympics.

Olympic bidding is the most highly politicized endeavor in an already political movement. The USOC has no desire to call out the International Olympic Committee, the World Anti-Doping Agency or the next host of the Olympics, nor does it want to start preaching to international partners and competitors about doping, morality and the environment.

""I've got to trust that the USOC will show me the way and that these things will be straightened out so we can focus on the task at hand,"" gold-medal hurdler Dawn Harper-Nelson said.

The USOC was a leader in reshaping the fight against doping and helping to fund the independent U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, which opened in 2000. USADA leaders have been outspoken about the doping crisis in Russia, with chairman Edwin Moses saying the country's track team should be banned from the upcoming Olympics because there's no way to clean up a corrupt system that quickly.

The USOC isn't taking things that far. Chairman Larry Probst said he is confident track's governing body, the IAAF, and WADA ""will do everything they can to protect the clean athlete"" as those agencies continue investigations into both Russia and Kenya.

Not all athletes are so sure. Mid-distance runner Alysia Montano, who has lost multiple medals at major championships to Russians later proven to have doped, said ""I'm not completely confident.""

""You want to see [sports leaders] say they care more about clean athletes than they do about their own backsides,"" she said.

On the Zika front, the USOC has taken a more proactive stance in informing athletes of the risks. The effort kicked into high gear shortly after U.S. soccer player Hope Solo suggested last month that if the Olympics were being held now, she wouldn't go. Although Zika doesn't cause symptoms in most people, it's considered dangerous because it could cause unborn babies to develop abnormally small heads -- a condition called microcephaly.

Last week, the USOC appointed a health commission to study and offer advice about the virus. Blackmun said athletes ultimately have to decide whether to travel to Brazil.

""One of the great things about having an advisory group is there's some level of independence that comes with it,"" he said. ""I don't know what kind of advice they'll come up with. Our sense is more that we put the decisions in the hands of the individual athletes.""

Meanwhile, chief of sport performance Alan Ashley said he has seen slow, steady signs of improvement in water conditions in Rio.

Independent testing of Guanabara Bay conducted by The Associated Press over the past year shows disease-causing viruses linked to human sewage at levels thousands of times above what would be considered alarming in the U.S.

But Ashley said U.S. leaders in canoe and kayak, sailing and triathlon have redoubled their efforts to make sure athletes are using proper hygiene in everything from the way they take their boats out of the water to how they handle drinking water they bring on deck.

""This is not complicated,"" Ashley said. ""But what I love about it is they've interacted very well with their athletes to make sure they give them good information.""

Ashley said that despite complicated issues, plans for Rio are moving ""full steam ahead.""

""The No. 1 concern is to maintain their health and safety, customize according to the situation, look at individual safety and be flexible,"" he said.",[]
espn.com,,"John Isner's serves, leadership leads the way for the Americans","['Niall Seewang', 'Greg Garber', 'Mark Hodgkinson', 'Nic Atkin', 'Peter Bodo', 'Pa Sport', 'Espn Com', 'Espn Staff']","This looked like it would be another Davis Cup tie that has long frustrated team captain Jim Courier and his talented U.S. squad.

Going into this past weekend, the Americans appeared snake-bit. The squad was on the road for the third tie in a row, this time under the most trying conditions -- climate- and location-wise. The Aussies, with sensation Nick Kyrgios and Bernard Tomic playing some of the best tennis of their lives in previous weeks, were generating more buzz than those ubiquitous Melbourne bottle flies.

As if that weren't enough, Aussie icon Lleyton Hewitt -- the most prolific Australian Davis Cup performer -- was making his debut as team captain.

This was more than a Davis Cup weekend Down Under; it was shaping up as a festive occasion to rival Australia Day.

Yet, the U.S. bumped off host Australia 3-1 on a grass court tailor-made for the Aussies to survive the first round of World Group play for the first time since 2013.

""After the last couple of years, [the win is] massive for us,"" Courier said in his post-tie news conference. ""You can't take any of these for granted. This is a tough matchup on paper, and it was a tough matchup in reality. For us to get into the second round is -- it's a big deal.""

The U.S. will next host Croatia, a 3-2 winner over Belgium, in the second round in July at a site yet to be determined. It appears to be a more winnable tie than this last one, which cuts right to the heart of the disappointments visited upon recent American teams: They've had trouble getting traction because of the vagaries of the unique Davis Cup rules determining the host nation's choice of surface, injuries and, frankly, some disappointing play at the worst of times.

The Americans did catch some breaks before the opening tie began. Kyrgios, who was suffering with a virus, was a last-minute scratch. His replacement in the first match, No. 77 Sam Groth, proved no match for the U.S. No. 1 singles player, John Isner.

Tomic kept the Aussies alive in the second match with a win against Jack Sock, but then the tie took another surprising turn.

Editor's Picks Kyrgios hits back at Tomic in war of words Nick Kyrgios has hit back at Bernard Tomic as the fallout continues from Australia's fractious first-round exit from the Davis Cup.

Masur tells Tomic, Kyrgios to 'get on with it' Former Australian Davis Cup captain Wally Masur's advice for Bernard Tomic and Nick Kyrgios is to ""shake hands and just get on with it.""

Hewitt natural fit as Davis Cup captain Lleyton Hewitt's biggest issue will be trying to make the team greater than the sum of its parts. And his first point of order will be to quell a potential feud between his two premier players. 2 Related

Hewitt, retired for all of five weeks, laced his shoes back up and inserted himself as a substitute for power server Groth in doubles. It was a somewhat controversial decision, although the U.S. team wasn't exactly taken by surprise. Mike Bryan had said of Hewitt: ""He's been playing more than anyone out there all week.""

Mike and Bob Bryan handled Hewitt and John Peers in a five-setter that wasn't as close as the score made it appear. Isner then dashed the Aussies' final hopes with an outstanding display against Tomic, winning the fourth-match battle of the No. 1s in four sets. Isner fired 49 aces, including a 157 mph third-set rocket that is an official pro record.

Courier described Isner's performance as ""unbelievable.""

For the U.S., it was more than dumb luck, Kyrgios' virus, Hewitt's substitution or even Isner's fireballs that accounted for the win.

All those factors played a role, but so did dedication and commitment on the part of a U.S. team that made a point to arrive Down Under to practice and acclimatize a full week before the tie.

""It was important for us to get down early, and when we have ties that are far away, these guys tend not to play the week before,"" Isner said to the media after he clinched. ""That's just the way this team tends to operate.""

Isner sounded very much like the team leader, not just the designated ace maker. It's yet another sign that things may be looking up for a team that might not be great but is probably much better than its recent record indicates.",[]

""It's my duty as Attorney General to look to the law, as passed by the people's representatives, to answer the questions put to this office,"" Paxton said in a statement. ""Paid daily 'fantasy sports' operators claim they can legally operate as an unregulated house, but none of their arguments square with existing Texas law. Simply put, it is prohibited gambling in Texas if you bet on the performance of a participant in a sporting event and the house takes a cut.

Texas joins other states in saying that daily fantasy games are illegal. Matthew Emmons/USA TODAY Sports

""These sites are also wrong in claiming an actual-contestant exception, which applies only to contestants in an actual skill or sporting event,"" Paxton added. ""And unlike some other states, Texas law only requires 'partial chance' for something to be gambling; it does not require that chance predominate.""

State representative Myra Crownover said in a statement that questions on the legality on daily fantasy sites prompted her to ask Paxton for an official ruling.

""Recent questions on the legality of DraftKings and FanDuel prompted me to ask the Attorney General to look into these gaming sites. I requested this opinion to clarify the law. It is our responsibility to try to make sure no business is profiting from illegal activity in Texas,"" she said.

Paxton's opinion also makes a distinction between daily fantasy and traditional season-long fantasy games, saying, as a general rule, that season-long fantasy is legal.

Attorneys general in three of the five most populated states -- Texas, New York and Illinois -- have issued recent opinions that daily fantasy is illegal. Paxton joins attorney generals in New York, Illinois and Vermont to rule that daily fantasy sports violate state gambling laws. Nevada is requiring a gambling license to operate daily fantasy sports, and several other states are taking a look at the industry.

Earlier this month, an appellate panel granted a stay to DraftKings and FanDuel in New York that would allow them to take business from residents in the state. The New York case brought by Attorney General Eric Schneiderman not only seeks to make daily fantasy illegal in the state, but also seeks to return money to players within the state who lost money on the sites. In May, DraftKings and FanDuel will have a chance to appeal the original interpretation that went against them in the New York Supreme Court.

""We strongly disagree with the Attorney General's prediction about what the courts may or may not do if ever presented with the issue of whether daily fantasy sports are legal under Texas law,"" DraftKings said in a statement. ""The Texas Legislature has expressly authorized games of skill, and daily fantasy sports are a game of skill. The Attorney General's prediction is predicated on a fundamental misunderstanding of DFS. We intend to continue to operate openly and transparently in Texas, so that the millions of Texans who are fantasy sports fans can continue to enjoy the contests they love.""

FanDuel echoed that sentiment in its own statement.

""Today's advisory opinion by the Attorney General of Texas is founded on a misinterpretation of the law and misunderstanding of the facts about fantasy sports,"" attorney John S. Kiernan said. ""Fantasy sports has always been a legal contest of skill in Texas. The Texas legislature has expressly recognized that payment of an entry fee to compete for prizes in a contest of skill is not illegal gambling. Texans have long enjoyed participating legally in a wide variety of contests on that basis. The Attorney General's advisory prediction that a Texas court might think fantasy sports fall outside that protection because fantasy sports contestants are not actually participating in the sports events disregards that the selection of a fantasy roster to compete against other contestants' selections is a separate valid contest of skill all its own.""

Several states, including New York, have introduced legislation to regulate daily fantasy sports.

The Fantasy Sports Trade Association is holding its winter meeting this week in Dallas. Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, is the keynote speaker.

.@KenPaxtonTX what a disappointment re DFS You certainly don't represent the views of Texans.  Mark Cuban (@mcuban) January 19, 2016

""If Attorney General Paxton is truly concerned about the small businesses that operate in Texas and the millions of people in Texas who enjoy fantasy sports, he would stop grandstanding and start working with the FSTA and the Texas Legislature on common sense consumer protection issues like those being proposed in Massachusetts, Florida, Indiana, Illinois, California and other forward-looking states,"" the FSTA said in a statement. ""Paxton's deliberate misinterpretation of existing Texas law represents the type of governmental overreach that he himself professes to reject. The FSTA vehemently opposes today's opinion.""

The Texas ruling also comes after a Dallas Morning News report last week that said records show that for months, Texas Lottery Commission executive director Gary Grief pursued a deal with DraftKings so that the commission could offer fantasy sports games.

The newspaper based its report on more than 400 emails, including communications with fantasy sports lobbyists, that it reviewed.

Commission chairman Winston Krause said Grief explored the matter at the urging of a lawmaker, whose identity Krause said he couldn't remember.

Grief said in a written statement that he would say only that the commission had stopped its efforts. He declined requests by the Morning News for an interview and didn't respond to an email from The Associated Press late Friday.

Arrieta and Chicago Cubs president Theo Epstein recently discussed parameters for an extension, but nothing is imminent. The sides talked several times this offseason but got only a one-year, $10.7 million deal done. After that was completed, Arrieta insisted that a longer-term deal would have to be for six or seven years, as there would be no point in a three- to four-year contract that would take him only a year or two past free agency. Arrieta has two seasons remaining before he reaches free agency.

""We've talked,"" Arrieta said Tuesday morning from Cubs camp. ""It's really not much of an issue for me as a distraction.""

Jake Arrieta has spoken to the Cubs about a new contract, but a deal is not imminent. Rick Scuteri/USA TODAY Sports

Arrieta, who went 22-6 with a 1.77 ERA last season, is more concerned with it becoming a distraction for the team, so he won't let it become a big deal as the Cubs embark on a highly anticipated season after falling short in the NLCS last year.

""Guys have reiterated not to let it bother you, and it hasn't,"" he said. ""It's a natural progression of where I'm at in my career and what I've been able to do. It comes with the territory. It's not much of a distraction for me, and I don't want it to be a distraction for anyone in this clubhouse.""

Talks don't have the same kind of urgency they might have a year from now. The pitcher stressed the ""small window"" that athletes have to maximize their earning, but at the same time he wouldn't say that the decision comes down exclusively to money.

""Money can only make you so happy,"" Arrieta said. ""I love my teammates, and I love Chicago. Those are more important than the contract extension for me.""

Epstein said that initial talks were a ""great exchange of ideas"" and could lead to something in the future.

""As soon as he got to spring training his priority was his 24 teammates and winning as many games he possibly can,"" Epstein said. ""That's no surprise to use knowing who he is. He's thinking about the team. There will be a time down the line to think of himself again.""

Although the season nears, Arrieta doesn't mind being involved in negotiations; in fact, he's at the forefront of them. Epstein and agent Scott Boras may discuss things, but Arrieta is not far from being involved.

""Both sides know I need to be in the loop, and it's pretty much unacceptable otherwise,"" he said.

Epstein also said that talks will not interfere with baseball.

""There will be quiet moments out of the competitive spotlight in the future where it will make sense to talk again. Its not something going on now or will as the season begins,"" he said.

Isaac Mwangi, CEO of Athletics Kenya, had already taken temporarily leave last week after two Kenyan runners alleged that he asked them for a bribe to reduce their doping bans.

The ethics board of the International Association of Athletics Federations said Monday that it had suspended Mwangi for 180 days ""in the interests of the integrity of the sport"" pending the outcome of an investigation. The suspension covers all duties and positions in Athletics Kenya and the IAAF.

The board said it imposed the provisional sanction after determining that an investigation was warranted ""in relation to potential subversion of the anti-doping control process in Kenya.""

The board appointed Sharad Rao to carry out the investigation. Rao is a former director of public prosecutions in Kenya and current chairman of the judges and magistrates vetting board. He is also a member of the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Mwangi has denied wrongdoing.

Mwangi said in a letter to the Kenyan federation's acting president last week that the allegations by 400-meter runner Joy Sakari and hurdler Francisca Koki Manunga were ""unsubstantiated"" and ""have caused me a lot of mental anguish.""

He asked for 21 days' leave while the allegations are investigated.

Sakari and Manunga told The Associated Press that Mwangi asked them each for a $24,000 bribe in an Oct. 16 meeting but that they could not raise the money. The athletes, both police officers in Kenya, tested positive for a banned diuretic at the 2015 world championships in Beijing. They are serving four-year bans.

The IAAF ethics commission was already investigating allegations that AK officials sought to subvert anti-doping in Kenya, solicited bribes and offered athletes reduced bans. The inquiry has led to the suspensions of AK president Isaiah Kiplagat, a vice president, David Okeyo, and former AK treasurer Joseph Kinyua.",[]
espn.com,,'I'm on my way to bigger and better things',"['Brian Campbell', 'Pa Sport', 'Dan Rafael', 'Nigel Collins']","As unbeaten welterweight Sadam Ali sees it, there's a time for everything in his journey to the top.

Sadam Ali-Jessie Vargas Where: D.C. Armory in Washington, D.C.

When: Saturday, 10 p.m. ET/PT

TV: HBO

Heading into his first title shot on Saturday against Jessie Vargas, Ali's time could very well be right now.

Ali (22-0, 13 KOs), 27, will face off with Vargas (26-1, 9 KOs) for a vacant 147-pound title in the co-main event of a card headlined by heavyweights Luis Ortiz and Tony Thompson at the D.C. Armory in Washington (HBO, 10 p.m. ET/PT).

A native of Brooklyn, New York, Ali spoke with ESPN.com ahead of the biggest fight of his career.

What are your emotions entering your first title shot?

It means so much to me. This is what every professional fighter waits for -- a world title. I'm super excited for it. I'm just ready to expand and get that world title and move forward.

Where does the timing of this title shot, at age 27, fit in for you in relation to the expectations you had for your career from the beginning?

I never knew when exactly it would come but I knew I would see it one day. Everything happens for a reason. Now is the time and I'm ready.

You became the mandatory challenger for Timothy Bradley Jr.'s title before he dropped the belt, opting instead for a third fight with Manny Pacquiao. How much did the change in opponent to Vargas affect you?

To me, it's an opportunity at a world title. Bigger fights are going to come in my career so it doesn't matter to me who I am fighting really. What matters to me the most is that world title.

Based on your styles, what type of fight are you expecting against Vargas?

I'm not sure because he's a counter puncher, but also he can be aggressive at times. I don't know what's going to happen in that fight. A few things can happen but whatever it is, I'm prepared for it.

Vargas stepped up to the highest level against Bradley last June and had a mixture of good and bad moments. How would you rate his performance?

He did OK. He was in there with a world-class fighter. He caught him with a great shot in the last round so he did pretty good.

You built a relationship going back to your amateur days with Paul Malignaggi, who has helped out in your corner. How important has his influence meant to your career?

Paulie is a former world champion. He has been in there and has been through a lot. He has a lot of knowledge so he's good to have on my team. We have known each other for so long.

Looking back at your recent fights, how close have you come to showcasing the absolute best of what you are capable of?

Pretty close. Not perfect yet but I'm still working my way up there. I believe I can get better and better.

Even though you are more known for your boxing ability, we saw your power on full display against Luis Carlos Abregu in 2014 What's the perfect balance for you between being a boxer and a puncher?

A mix of both, I would say. Maybe 60/40 toward the boxing. I'm not sure if my power [is underrated]. Maybe to some people.

The Vargas fight gives you another prime opportunity to showcase yourself on HBO. What are you hoping to teach any new fans about where you potentially fit within this division?

That I deserve to be on that level and that I am one of the top fighters. I would like to prove that and showcase my skills. I have been improving more and more, and that's the most important thing -- to keep learning. You never want to reach an end point of learning something.

How long have you imagined what that moment might feel like when they place your first world title belt around your waist?

I remember just seeing so many champions win titles and I remember thinking, ""I can't wait until it's my turn."" I think about it but it's still a little surreal to me that it's here and it's so close. It's amazing. It will mean that all the time and the hard work I have done -- not only in this fight but in my career -- it's paying off. I'm on my way to bigger and better things so it would mean a lot to me and to everybody around me.

You have been on the verge the past few years of really looking like you are ready to break out and become a star. How hard has it been to be patient and wait your turn during this season of your development?

The way I look at it is God has a plan and there's a time for everything. So I don't get impatient and I don't rush. Everything happens for a reason. When it comes, it comes.

You hung tough against a determined opponent in your last bout when you outpointed Francisco Santana in April. How important was the timing of that fight -- in which you were forced to show your chin -- as the final step before your first title shot?

I believe it was important. He had that come-forward style against me and somebody that was about 21 pounds heavier than me. He was definitely the biggest guy I was in there against and it was tough. But I'm a fighter. I have been boxing since I was 8 years old. I have been in there with so many different styles. I just know what to do in the ring, and that's what I did.",[]
espn.com,,Calvin Johnson is another piece of a good pattern of NFL players retiring earlier than necessary,"['Ben Goessling', 'Michael Rothstein', 'David Newton', 'Josh Weinfuss', 'Jim Trotter']","Wide receiver Calvin Johnson made it official Tuesday morning, informing the Detroit Lions that he is walking away from the NFL after a nine-year career in which he broke numerous franchise receiving marks and set 15 NFL records. The decision was neither easy nor hasty, he said in a statement released by the team. There was a lot of soul searching and prayer that went into it.

It's simple to view the impact of his decision through a narrow prism and focus on how it will immediately affect the Lions. But I choose to view it through a wider lens and see how it could influence players down the line. Johnson's retirement is an affirmation that the iceberg is melting, that pro athletes see themselves as people and not just as players and perhaps that the money earned even during a short NFL career makes life away from the game less scary a proposition.

Last year, we saw a handful of players walk away while still relatively early in their careers, mainly due to concerns about quality of life beyond the game. Linebackers Chris Borland of San Francisco and Jason Worilds of Pittsburgh, for instance, worried about the consequences of concussions. Linebacker Patrick Willis, also a 49er, was certainly a veteran, but he was still a good player who decided he wanted to be able to walk without pain in his later years after dealing with foot issues. And quarterback Jake Locker, who missed 18 games over his final two seasons after being drafted eighth overall by Tennessee in 2011, cited a diminished interest in football.

Their actions contrast with those of players from previous decades who tried to wring as many seasons and as many dollars out of the game as possible. Part of it was financial -- players didn't make as much money then as they do today. But part of it was emotional. Their identities were tied to the game.

But slowly we're seeing a shift. It might not be a 7.0, 8.0 or 9.0 on the Richter scale, but even at 3.0, it's changing the landscape.

""We constantly address our players about the need to understand they are businessmen in the business of football,"" said NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith. ""I know that everybody else spends a lot of time talking about the game and looking at it as a fan, but we want our players to not only love the game, but to be in a position financially and educationally where they know when is the best time for them to do something else. The fact that our guys are going to live and have far more of the balance of their lives as non-football players, it's a positive step when people are looking at issues of education and things they want to do other than playing football, when they're looking at their own health and making decisions based on that.""

According to ESPN Stats & Information, five players age 30 or younger retired in 2011, a figure that accounted for 24 percent of the players who retired. The numbers have increased steadily each season since, with a five-year high of 20 players age 30 or younger having retired already this offseason.

To some outsiders, it's hard to fathom why someone would walk away from the game while still an impact performer. The fame, the adulation, the money, the camaraderie, the competition -- it's intoxicating. But the reality is that more and more players are beginning to look at the big picture and find meaning in life beyond the game. Not a huge amount, perhaps, but enough to notice the difference.

""I haven't really talked about it all since I got done because a lot of the stuff -- a lot of people didn't understand that aspect of it, and if they didn't understand it, they weren't going to understand it by me talking about it for 15 minutes,"" Locker said. ""I believe that you're much more than an athlete. We were created for a much bigger purpose than to play a sport. That's the reason behind why I chose what I did. I felt that God was calling me in a different direction in my life, and that's far more important to me -- and where I know my purpose is -- than ever taking another snap under center.

Jake Locker's NFL career was an injury-addled struggle for much of the time, but he wasn't forced out of the league. Peter G. Aiken/Getty Images

""I got to know a personal relationship with Christ, and I didn't feel that desire to play that I always had. I felt like it was because He was calling me in a new direction. I got to be away from the game for a year, and I see what that is now, and I'm living it out. I'm so thankful for it. I look at a lot of things that I've gone through this last year, and if I would've been playing, it would've been a lot more difficult.""

When he retired after only four seasons, Locker was surprised at some of the messages he received from other players.

""I got more messages than I thought I would from guys who said: 'Hey,I really respect and admire you for what you did. I wish I could do the same thing,'"" he said. ""It took me back. Why? Because if you feel that way, why don't you do it? That's my thought process. If you wish you could do it, you can. Nobody is holding a gun to your head and having you play football.""

Johnson isn't departing at the top of his game, but he's not far from it. His 88 catches last season were his most since 2012, when he set a franchise record with 122. He also had 1,214 yards and nine touchdowns. Standing 6-foot-5, 237 pounds with sprinter's speed and tremendous leaping ability, he still commanded double and triple teams. But injuries took a toll on his body over the past four years despite appearing in all 16 games last season.

There has been speculation that he retired for the same reason that iconic Lions running back Barry Sanders did before the 1999 season: frustration with direction of the franchise. In the documentary ""Barry Sanders: A Football Life"", the Hall of Famer said he had lost the ""drive, determination and enjoyment"" for the game, adding: ""Over the next few years, it looked like we would probably be rebuilding, and we had gotten rid of some good players. I just felt like it was time to make a change.""

The Lions had seven losing seasons and appeared in only two postseasons in Johnson's nine seasons. Still, he did not mention frustration with the organization in the statement released by the team. In fact, he predicted a bright future for the franchise.

Johnson could follow his heart in part because of what was in his wallet. He earned nearly $114 million over his career, which likely made it easier to walk away from the nearly $16 million in salary he was scheduled to earn this year. He was able to view football as a business, not just a game.

""I think it's great when any player has put himself in a position where he can make a decision that is best for him,"" said Bengals offensive tackle and NFLPA president Eric Winston. ""Calvin was so much fun to watch, a truly dominant player for a long time. I'm incredibly happy for him that he leaves the game on his own terms.""",[]
espn.com,,Mel Kiper has his third mock draft of 2016 with free agency considered for each pick,"['Mel Kiper Jr', 'Dan Graziano', 'Chris Forsberg', 'Mel Kiper', 'Wayne Drehs', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Bill Barnwell', 'Eric Williams', 'Royce Young', 'Jeff Goodman']","Insider

Mel Kiper Jr. breaks down the top three picks in his latest NFL mock draft and why both the Chargers and Titans could select an offensive tackle. (1:56)

Free agency doesn't change draft evaluations, only the occasional need. And I don't think it shifts needs dramatically, because it's the rare team that will tell you it was able to truly fix problems on the free-agency market. In the draft, you want core players you expect to be with the organization for years to come. You don't see these guys as fixes to immediate problems. Teams use rookies, but they don't want to have to depend on them. Free agents, on the other hand, simply aren't expected to be around for a long time.

With free agency the hot topic during the next week, here's an updated mock, and a note on how free agency could change the pick.

A player with an asterisk next to his name has a year of eligibility remaining. Two asterisks implies two years.

1. Tennessee Titans

*Laremy Tunsil, OT, Ole Miss

The top left tackle in the draft goes to a team where offensive line help is a must. I'm certain the Titans will continue to shop this pick, but it could be difficult to get a good offer.

Free-agency effect: As usual, free agency isn't exactly flush with offensive tackle help. The Titans can shop elsewhere knowing they have a tackle option here. While it's not a free-agency move, the addition of DeMarco Murray is another reminder the O-line should be a priority.

2. Cleveland Browns

Carson Wentz, QB, North Dakota State

I wouldn't rule out Cleveland taking a non-quarterback here and then getting one with the No. 32 pick, but Wentz would make sense here as a super physical talent whom new coach Hue Jackson can develop.

Free-agency effect: Is there a QB in free agency clearly better than a healthy Josh McCown, one they want to pay big dollars for? Right now, I doubt the Browns make a splash there.

3. San Diego Chargers

*Ronnie Stanley, OT, Notre Dame

The offensive line has been a major problem area going on a few years, and Stanley can be plugged in immediately. The Chargers need D-line help as well, but the draft is much deeper at that position.

Free-agency effect: If the Chargers find O-line help in free agency, it could shift the thinking here if they have players graded similarly.

espn.com,,Could Japanese aces Kenta Maeda and Masahiro Tanaka finally face off?,"['Doug Padilla', 'One Naci N']","GLENDALE, Ariz. -- When the Los Angeles Dodgers and New York Yankees renew an old rivalry during a mid-September interleague series this year, there is a distinct possibility that an entire country could be entranced.

That country would not necessarily be the United States.

If health prevails and stars align, there stands an outside chance that old middle school rivals and Japanese pitching stars Masahiro Tanaka of the Yankees and Kenta Maeda of the Dodgers could face off against each other as pitchers. It has never happened.

Somehow, despite inspiring each other from opposite dugouts as kids, these two grand ships managed to keep passing each other in the night, at least when it came to a mound meeting.

Tanaka and Maeda knew each others accomplishments well, even if they didnt quite know each other personally. They grew up attending nearby middle schools outside of Osaka and already were baseball royalty in the area at a young age. They didnt become acquaintances until both turned professional in Japan.

When they were blossoming as middle school stars, though, Tanaka was a star catcher of the area while Maeda was the stud pitcher.

In fact, it was Maeda who went on to play for Team Japan in tournaments in their age group. Tanaka did not.

Ive always thought that he was a good rival or somebody that I could match someday, Tanaka said through an interpreter from Yankees camp. But he was on a team that was able to go to the finals in tournaments, so that was part of the reason he was picked as the ace of Team Japan in the age group.

Maeda said he did face Tanaka, the hitter, on a number of occasions. It was a matchup Maeda did not take lightly, and he considered those meetings as moments that sharpened his focus and, perhaps, made him a better pitcher because of it.

It was a good stimulation to have, Maeda said through his interpreter from Dodgers camp. He was the one that definitely represented the class of 88 so it was good to have him be the leader of that group.

Maeda is not referring to any graduating class of 1988, but instead the year they both were born. Maedas birthday is April 11, while Tanaka was born on Nov. 1.

Not to be lost in translation is that they each thought the other was the standard to match.

Tanaka quickly raised the stakes when he became a pitcher as his high school years approached and his profile exploded. But the change came when he moved to the northern part of Japan, some 900 miles away.

Tanaka became a dominating starter at Komadai Tomakomai High School, pitching in an epic 2006 high school national championship game that captured the attention of all of Japan. Quickly, it was Tanaka who became the ace pitcher of the age group.

Maedas pitching resume grew, as well, as the two headed toward professional careers. Maeda moved to the Japan Central League in 2008 with the Hiroshima Toyo Carp, one year after Tanaka turned pro with the Rakuten Golden Eagles of the Japan Pacific League.

The Japan Central League and Japan Pacific League are the equivalent of Major League Baseballs National League and American League, so while they were equal, they remained separate. For six consecutive seasons the duo pitched professionally in Japan, at the same time, but never had the occasion to match up against each other. They did get the chance to be teammates for Team Japan during the 2013 World Baseball Classic.

In 2014, Tanaka signed with the Yankees and two years later, Maeda followed his rivals footsteps by making the move to MLB himself, but again, they are in opposite leagues. Tanaka was one of the first to congratulate his old rival.

I got a text message from him, congratulating me on becoming a Dodger, Maeda said. We also talked about what to expect here once I came to the States.

With his two years of experience in New York, not to mention the knowledge he has gained recovering from an elbow injury that required arthroscopic surgery in October, Tanaka had plenty of advice to give. But he kept a recent conversation to the basics.

Youre here in a different country and it is obvious that there will be a difference with how things are, Tanaka said of his advice to Maeda. But the most important part is to be able to adjust to the baseball here, being able to make the adjustments. I told him that was one of the biggest things, or the biggest advice I can give.""

Maeda has heeded the advice closely. Because of what Tanaka told him, as well as what others who have pitched in the United States after pitching in Japan have said, Maeda chose to follow the Dodgers workout program instead of bringing with him the one he used with Hiroshima.

Maeda, though, did limit himself to a 14-pitch between-start bullpen session this week, a lighter load that he typically used in Japan and felt was appropriate for the early stages of spring training.

Both Tanaka and Maeda are taking the appropriate strides to make sure they are healthy for the long season ahead, which would mean that both would be available for that three-day midweek series in New York in six months, one that could garner a lot of attention back home.

Im very much looking forward to pitching against him because I have never been able to, Maeda said. I never had that chance in Japan.

They just had to travel nearly 7,000 miles to give it a chance at becoming a reality.

And if it does come to pass, would it become an impromptu national holiday in Japan?

Maeda laughed even before the question was translated to him.

I guess if it did turn out to be like that, I guess a lot of people would watch, he said with a grin.

espn.com,,Ortiz's interim belt won't be at stake against Thompson,['Dan Rafael'],"Heavyweight banger Luis The Real King Kong Ortiz has not been forced to go the distance since an eight-round decision win in 2010 and will look to keep that streak intact when he faces former two-time world title challenger Tony Thompson on Saturday night (HBO, 10 p.m. ET/PT) in the Boxing After Dark main event at the DC Armory in Washington, D.C., Thompsons hometown.

However, Ortiz (24-0, 21 KOs) will not be defending his interim belt in the bout, as the WBA announced this week that it has declined to sanction the fight.

The explanation given does make some sense. The organizations view is that the 44-year-old Thompson (40-6, 27 KOs) does not merit the opportunity, because he is 2-3 in his past five fights and coming off a 10-round decision loss to Malik Scott in October. He is also not rated in the organizations top 15 heavyweights.

Ortiz is also supposed to face mandatory challenger Alexander Ustinov on or before June 19 as part of the organizations mandated tournament to whittle its three heavyweight titleholders -- champion Tyson Fury, regular titlist Ruslan Chagaev or Lucas Browne, should he defeat Chagaev on Saturday in a mandatory fight, and Ortiz -- down to just one.

Should Thompson, who accepted the fight with Ortiz on only a few weeks notice when Alexander Dimitrenko backed out of the fight, win the fight on Saturday, he will not take Ortizs place in the tournament against Ustinov.

The WBA has no objection to a stay-busy fight, as long as its called a stay-busy fight and not misrepresented as a title bout, which appears to be the case, the WBA said.",[]

Wearables, motion-capturing cameras and advanced biometric data are already altering the landscape of the NBA. But that could be just the beginning. Researchers and tech companies are already at work developing the next wave of tools to advance the game of basketball. Here are five ways NBA players could optimize their bodies in the near future.

- Illustrations by Todd Detwiler

Tech Tats

You can't swing an elbow in the NBA without smacking into a tattoo. But now, instead of having an artistic use, a tat could be part of the wearable-technology revolution. Introducing Chaotic Moon Studios, a software development company in Austin, Texas, that has created a device that lives on your skin and can gather, among other things, data on shooting form -- such as where, when and how a player is applying force. It can also measure biometric health through tiny biosensors that wirelessly transfer data to, of course, an app on your phone. Says Eric Schneider, a technologist for Chaotic Moon, which has been developing the product for the past six months: ""The Tech Tat lives on the skin like a fabric arm brace."" But where will J.R. Smith find the room?

Dragonfly vision

NBA playmakers often seem to have eyes in the back of their heads. What if they had literal eyes in the back of their heads -- or at least true full-court vision? For that, science is looking to dragonflies, whose protruding, globular eyes allow them a 360-degree field of vision. Australian researchers have created software that can mimic that eyesight, which they are currently developing for use in bionic eyes. One director of the project, Dr. Steven Wiederman, has predicted commercial application within the next five to 10 years. The future of the no-look pass? Hard to envision.

Transcranial stimulation

It can take years for an NBA player to perfect his shooting mechanics. But thanks to nascent technology called transcranial direct current stimulation, players might one day jump-start their jump shot with a little jolt of lightning ... to the head. When tested by the Air Force, airmen became twice as accurate at identifying targets after receiving a mild current to the brain to accelerate cognitive functions. ""The evidence to date is promising,"" says Dr. Andy McKinley of the Air Force Research Laboratory. ""There's reason to believe the stimulation has a positive effect on learning enhancements."" Those include what McKinley calls motor-memory tasks like riding a bike or playing piano. What about shooting free throws? Keep your fingers crossed, Andre Drummond.

Nanotechnology

At this point, there's barely a tendon in Kobe Bryant's body he hasn't snapped. Still intact, shockingly, are his ACLs. But should he ever tear one of them -- he is 100, after all -- nanotechnology might well be there to save him. Guillermo Ameer, a professor of biomedical engineering at Northwestern, is pioneering a new form of ACL reconstruction in which human-bone nanocrystals are surgically grafted with man-made biomaterial and polyester fibers. If it's approved for humans, Ameer predicts faster and less painful recoveries than with current ACL reconstructions. Most likely scenario: Kobe someday performs the surgery on himself.

CRISPR gene editing

Imagine you could cherry-pick the best basketball traits, like higher muscle mass or stronger bone density, from a biological buffet. This isn't science fiction, it's science reality, in the form of new gene-editing technology called clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, or CRISPR. In 2015, Chinese scientists devised a tool for gene editing in nonviable human embryos. Cool? Definitely! Scary? You bet. Using CRISPR to create the perfect NBA player isn't simply a mechanical matter, it's a moral one. In fact, the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard is mum on its research related to humans. ""We don't engage in hypotheticals,"" a rep from the institute told The Mag. Of course, it's only a hypothetical until it isn't.",[]

Kenya already missed one deadline this month to pass anti-doping legislation and properly set up and provide funding for its new national anti-doping agency.

The latest draft regulations submitted by the Anti-Doping Agency of Kenya still do not comply with the world anti-doping code, WADA said in a statement Monday. The East African country now will be assessed by an independent compliance review committee on April 5, when ""consideration will be given to a possible recommendation of non-compliance,"" WADA said.

That committee will make its recommendation to WADA's board, which will make the final decision on Kenya's status at its meeting May 12.

Declaring Kenya noncompliant could cause its athletes to miss the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro in August, as IAAF president Sebastian Coe previously said his sport would consider suspending the country, a distance-running powerhouse, if it's in breach of anti-doping rules.

The IAAF suspended Russia from all international track and field competition after it was declared noncompliant with WADA's code following a report detailing a vast system of doping and cover-ups.

Along with problems with its national anti-doping body and failure to pass anti-doping legislation, Kenya is accused of doping cover-ups, with four senior athletics officials now under investigation by the IAAF for ""potential subversion"" of anti-doping procedures.

The chief executive of Athletics Kenya, the national track and field federation, was the latest official to be suspended. Isaac Mwangi was placed under investigation by the IAAF on Monday. Two runners who failed doping tests at last year's world championships alleged in an interview with The Associated Press that Mwangi asked them for bribes in exchange for more lenient sanctions, leading to the investigation.

Mwangi joined Athletics Kenya president Isaiah Kiplagat, vice president David Okeyo and former federation treasurer Joseph Kinyua in being suspended by the IAAF pending investigations by its ethics committee. Kiplagat, Okeyo and Kinyua also are accused of subverting anti-doping rules and other wrongdoing related to the misappropriation of federation money.

More than 40 Kenyan athletes have failed doping tests since the 2012 Olympics, throwing the sport into crisis in the country.",[]
espn.com,,Reaction to Team North America World Cup roster,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Dan Marrazza', 'Craig Custance', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Sean Allen', 'John Buccigross', 'Sarah Goldstein', 'Scott Burnside', 'John Rosengren', 'Paul Grant']","They're the team nobody wants to play. The first look at Team North America's 16-man roster reaffirms what we've suspected all along: This team is going to be fast, it's going to be skilled, and there's a strong possibility it will knock off one of the world powers at some point in this tournament, if not win it all.

""We have a lot of youth and excitement and going to play a high tempo game,"" associate general manager Stan Bowman said.

With general manager Peter Chiarelli's first major hurdle crossed, here's a look at the surprises, snubs and superlatives for Team North America's World Cup entry.

Biggest surprise: J.T. Miller, New York Rangers

All the big names are here: Connor McDavid, Jack Eichel, Brandon Saad, Aaron Ekblad, Nathan MacKinnon and more. But the biggest surprise is Miller grabbing a spot on the initial roster. That's not to say it isn't deserved. Miller has been good for the Rangers this season with 17 goals in 63 games and has consistently been one of their better forwards.

""He might have been the player of most discussion in the last few weeks,"" Chiarelli said. ""He's getting stronger. He's making more plays. Protecting the puck. He's driving the net...

This team is loaded with speed, but Miller brings the physicality Chiarelli was looking for. Among Rangers, only Tanner Glass has more hits than Miller's 146, and the 22-year-old Miller gives North America coach Todd McLellan a well-rounded forward he can feel comfortable plugging in up and down the lineup.

""He has gained confidence and feels comfortable in his role right now,"" one NHL scout texted after hearing Miller made the team. ""His skating is better than people may think.""

Biggest snub: Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Edmonton Oilers

This team is loaded at center with McDavid, Eichel, MacKinnon, Dylan Larkin, Sean Couturier and Sean Monahan all capable of centering a line for McLellan's team. Somebody is going to get squeezed off the roster, but there's added intrigue here, given that Nugent-Hopkins is the guy on the outside right now despite his GM and coach in Edmonton also running the show here.

Nugent-Hopkins broke his finger blocking a shot earlier this season and has played in only 46 games; putting up only 30 points hurt his cause. Opting to instead take a player like Couturier at this point is an indication that Team North America sees Couturier playing a shutdown center role, something he's better suited for than Nugent-Hopkins.

""That was a difficult one,"" Chiarelli said. ""Ryan is an important part of our team in Edmonton. He's been hurt. ""I spoke with Ryan a week or so ago. We talked about this situation. I told him, 'You are an important part of the Oilers. Go and play and things will sort themselves out.' Ryan was really good about it. He knows what he has to do. I would expect him to be a part of this team at the end of the day.""

Biggest lock: John Gibson, Anaheim Ducks

At this point, it would take an act of nature to remove Gibson as the starting goalie of this team. Connor Hellebuyck was impressive in 26 games this season with the Jets (.918 save percentage), but he's back in the AHL. Gibson, meanwhile, is part of the reason the Ducks have turned their season around.

He's 15-8-2 with a .918 save percentage, and if he can wrestle time away from Frederik Andersen, he could earn valuable playoff experience this spring with the Ducks. Gibson also has a sparkling international resume with Team USA, winning gold at both the 2011 world U18 championships and the 2013 world junior championship.

Biggest skyrocket: Dylan Larkin, Detroit Red Wings

In training camp, it wasn't a certainty that Larkin would even make the Red Wings' NHL roster, let alone this one. That seems like a long time ago. He's progressed from a player who was simply on Chiarelli's original watch list, to a player who has now secured a spot as one of the top nine forwards on this roster.

Larkin has blazing speed and is just one goal shy of reaching the 20-goal mark as a 19-year-old rookie. It has been an amazing progression in a short period of time for one of hockey's best young players.",[]

FantasyHub.com, a smallish operator billed as ""fantasy sports for charity,"" posted on its site Friday that it has temporarily suspended operations and notified players via email.

""Due to advice from counsel, we cannot divulge many details but we have been in discussions with a strategic third party regarding the company and are now finalizing those discussions,"" the email, reviewed by ESPN, reads, ""While we can't say more at this time, we'll be in touch very soon with full information.""

The announcement followed days of grumblings from FantasyHub players, who said their withdrawal requests had not been processed and they were unable to reach anyone at the site. Editor's Picks Rodenberg: DFS state-by-state tracker What is the legal status of daily fantasy sports in every state? Ryan Rodenberg breaks down the situation in all 50 states in a file that will be updated as news warrants.

Attempts to reach FantasyHub were unsuccessful. The site claimed to have raised more than $200,000 for various charities through its fantasy contests.

During a time when the industry is under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers and politicians, FantasyHub is the second DFS site to close in the last month, following FantasyUp.com. After ceasing operations and notifying players their balances would not be paid, FantasyUp was acquired by fantasy operator iTEAM Network, which took over player balances and ensured funds would be available.

Gabe Hunterton the CEO of iTEAM Network added: ""To keep instances like FantasyUp and Fantasy Hub from occurring over and over again, the industry must require complete transparency on handling of customer funds. It's not difficult. You keep the customer money segregated. Then you have an independent firm verify that you've done so. Period. The migration of customers to the new FantasyUp.com has gone extremely well. The customers now know that their funds are secured by the responsible financial practices of iTEAM Network.""

FantasyHub is a member of the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, which requires members to keep player funds segregated from business operations.

FSTA president Paul Charchian told Chalk, ""The FSTA is supporting bills and legislation that require third party auditing, and similar to the strong exhortation I gave during my keynote at the FSTA Winter Conference in Dallas, we continually make it clear that it's never okay to spend prize money. The legislation we are proposing in each state also has provisions for regulating and auditing DFS companies to ensure that prize obligations are not mixed with other company funds. We are cautiously optimistic that FantasyHub will find a backer to help them meet their prize obligations.""

Several FantasyHub players told ESPN that they had not been able to access their funds for over a week.

""I'm quite concerned I won't see any of that money at this point,"" said Ryan Clifford, a FantasyHub player, who claims to have a $1,200 balance on the site and requested a withdrawal two weeks ago.",[]
espn.com,,Why Leicester City could become biggest long-shot champion in sports history,[],"Leicester City sits atop the Premier League by five points with 13 games left in a 38-game season as it heads into a pivotal match on Sunday against perennial power Arsenal. If the previous sentence doesn't mean anything to you, imagine if the Philadelphia 76ers were the top team in today's NBA standings or the Cleveland Browns had the NFL's best record heading into Week 12.

Even those comparisons might not do justice to the performance Leicester City has produced in 2015-16. Not only did the Foxes have a 13-game winless run last season, they were only six points from being relegated to a lower level of competition. Leicester City wasn't even in the Premier League two years ago. The club earned promotion to England's top soccer league starting in the 2014-15 season for the first time in 10 years.

William Hill, an England-based bookmaker, had the Foxes as 5,000-1 long shots to win the Premier League before this season. If they hold on to claim the title, it would be the biggest upset in sports history, according to William Hill press officer Joe Crilly. (The Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook had given Leicester City 2,500-1 odds to win the Premier League. The 76ers, by comparison, had 200-1 odds to win this season's NBA title coming off an 18-64 season.)

There is no previous example of an underdog the likes of Leicester City beating odds as long as 5,000-1. There have been a few 100-1 or longer shots that either shockingly came through or fell tantalizingly short.

LAS VEGAS -- With the Denver Broncos defeating the Carolina Panthers 24-10 on Sunday in Super Bowl 50, all 32 NFL teams are now in the offseason (though the NFL offseason is almost nonexistent in today's year-round news cycle).

Before turning our attention to pro and college basketball, Major League Baseball and the rest of the sports betting menu, we here at Chalk wanted to take one last look at the pro football season.

Below, Erin Rynning and I give a gambling recap of each team's season, including how each team performed against the spread and in relation to totals and season win totals.

AFC East

2015 season win total: 10.5 (over -120)

Regular-season record: 12-4 (over total by 1.5 games)

ATS record: 7-6-3; O/U: 8-7-1

After an offseason of uncertainty, Tom Brady's four-game suspension was overturned and the defending champions seemed liked they were on a mission to crush everyone. The Patriots won their first 10 games outright and were good to their backers at 5-2-3 against the spread. They flew over their season win total in Week 13, but injuries caught up with them late in the season as they went 2-4 straight up and ATS and lost home-field advantage, which proved critical in the AFC Championship Game at Denver.",[]

The $132.54 million wagered on the underdog Denver Broncos' 24-10 win over the Carolina Panthers at the sportsbooks topped the previous record of $119 million set in 2014. The $13.31 million was the third most Nevada's 194 regulated sportsbooks have ever won on the Super Bowl.

Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gambling Association, released a statement Monday that added perspective to the record betting volume, which ran as high as an estimated $4.1 billion in illegal wagers.

This year, the books benefited from balanced action on the Broncos and Panthers. Sportsbook operator CG Technology said less than $50,000 separated the two teams, in terms of money bet on the point spread, with 51 percent of it on favored Carolina. The money bet on the over/under total at CG Technology was also evenly split. Carolina closed as a consensus five-point favorite, with the total at 43.5 at the majority of books.

With Packers general manager Ted Thompson signing his own players early this year, could moves in the free agent market be on the horizon for Green Bay? (1:27)

Take a look at next season's Super Bowl odds and you'll see that the Vegas experts expect next season to look a lot like this past one. The top seven teams in the odds all made this past season's final eight.

But recent history shows that we shouldn't necessarily expect the same teams to stay on top every year. The Colts, Cowboys and Ravens all missed the playoffs in 2015 after making the final eight in 2014.

To return to Super Bowl contention, each of last season's final eight must address significant weaknesses this offseason. Remarkably, half of the eight teams have the same primary weakness: the offensive line, which could make draft night very interesting. With these teams picking one after the other in each round, the incentive to trade up could be particularly strong as the teams vie to fill the same hole.

espn.com,,Corey Seager tops 2016 ranking of top 100 prospects,"['Dan Graziano', 'Chris Forsberg', 'Wayne Drehs', 'Eric Williams', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Bill Barnwell', 'Keith Law', 'Royce Young', 'Jeff Goodman', 'Joe Mcdonald']","Insider

Welcome to ESPN Insider's 2016 ranking of the top 100 prospects in baseball.

This is my ninth such ranking for Insider, and this time around there's a ton of turnover on the list thanks to the big year for rookies in 2015. In fact, my No. 1 and No. 3 prospects from last year won the Rookie of the Year awards in the NL and AL, respectively, and the Nos. 6 and 15 prospects were the runners-up in the AL. Eleven of my top 20 prospects last year graduated to the majors.

As usual, the list is heavy on position players up the middle, with a fifth of the top 100 currently playing shortstop. And there's a slew of center fielders on the list, but it's very light on catchers and third basemen. There also is a bit of a renaissance for left-handed starters right now, with a dozen on the list this year. The back of the list seems, just at a glance, to be the youngest I've had in years, thanks in part to all the graduations from the high minors in the past year.

The guidelines

The rankings are limited to players who still have rookie eligibility; that means they have yet to exceed 130 at-bats or 50 innings pitched in the majors and have not yet spent 45 days on the active roster of a major league club, excluding call-ups during the roster expansion period after Sept. 1.

Only players who have signed professional contracts are eligible.

I do not consider players with professional experience in Japan or Korea ""prospects"" for the purpose of this exercise. I also exclude Cuban players who are considered professional free agents by Major League Baseball by virtue of their experience in Cuba's Serie Nacional de Beisbol. As such, this list excludes Byung-Ho Park and Kenta Maeda, but it will consider Cuban players whom MLB treats as amateurs, like Yusniel Diaz (who is in the rankings) and Yadier Alvarez.

When ranking players, I consider scouting reports on players -- usually my own, supplemented with conversations with other scouts and front-office executives, as needed -- as well as performance, adjusted for age and context. I've made one adjustment in my ranking philosophy in recent years, favoring higher-upside prospects over lower-ceiling prospects that are closer to the majors. This better reflects how these players are valued now by front offices and scouting departments, and it gives me a chance to deliver more information on prospects whose names or scouting reports might be new to you.

I use the 20 to 80 grading scale in these comments to avoid saying ""average"" and ""above average"" thousands of times across the 100 player comments. On that scale, a grade of 50 equals major league average, 55 is above average, 60 is plus, 45 is fringy or below average and so on. Giancarlo Stanton has 80 raw power, for instance. David Ortiz has 20 speed. Andrelton Simmons is an 80 defender with an 80 arm. An average fastball for a right-hander is 90 to 92 mph, with 1 to 2 mph off that for a lefty.

I've included last year's rank for players who appeared in the Top 100 in 2015. An ineligible player (labeled as ""NE"" for not eligible in the 2015 rank area) was still an amateur at this time last January, whereas an unranked player (labeled ""NR"" for not ranked) was eligible but didn't make the cut. I've also tagged players who were on last year's sleepers lists (""SL"") -- I listed a player or two per team in my 2015 team-by-team prospect rankings -- and identified those on my list of 10 players who just missed the cut (""JM"").

1. Corey Seager, SS/3B

Age: 21 (4/27/94) | B/T: L/R

Height: 6-4 | Weight: 215

Top level: MLB | 2015: 5

Seager is the game's best prospect, a superlative hitter who projects to do everything at the plate and might even be able to do it at shortstop for a year or two before becoming a top-flight defender at third base.

Seager, the younger brother of Mariners third baseman Kyle, has electric hands at the plate and does everything very easily -- his swing, hip rotation and power look effortless -- but it's his approach that makes him the best prospect in baseball. Seager's pitch recognition is advanced way beyond his years, and you'll see him make adjustments within at-bats that even veterans don't make. He's better than most players his age at adjusting to a pitch he didn't expect and does very well covering the outer half without creating a hole on the inner third. He's tall and his swing plane can be high, so he's a little vulnerable to the pitch down at the knees. But for someone his age, that's a minor weakness to have as your primary issue at the plate.

While Seager reached the majors as a shortstop, he's already one of the biggest players in major league history to man that position and is likely to outgrow it if he hasn't already done so. (Seager is listed at 215 pounds; the only heavier shortstops in MLB history have been Hanley Ramirez, late-in-his-career Miguel Tejada, Juan Uribe and Alex Rodriguez.) Seager has the hands for short but not the speed or agility, while his arm would play anywhere on the diamond, making a move to third base -- where his defense would likely be plus or better, perhaps saving as many as 10 runs per year -- the most probable long-term outcome. He has MVP upside even if he moves to third, and would be even more valuable if he beats my expectations and hangs around at short.

Older brother Kyle, still just 28, already has had four All-Star-caliber seasons for Seattle, but he's going to end up second fiddle to his big little brother.",[]

Now shes a world championships medalist who hopes to set a 5,000-meter personal best at her season opener in the Millrose Games on Saturday.

I am hoping for a PR, the 25-year-old Infeld said the other day while finishing up an altitude-training stint in Flagstaff, Arizona. I dont know exactly what kind of shape Im in but I would love to run under 15:00. Her best is 15:07.18, set at the Portland Track Festival last June.

After Millrose, Infeld plans to run the 3,000 on March 11 at the U.S. indoor championships, with an eye toward making the team for the following weeks world indoor championships.

If she dons the U.S. jersey for the world meet in Portland, shell do so with different expectationsfrom herself and othersthan when she ran the 10,000 at the world championships in Beijing last August.

Infeld emerged from that meet, of course, with a bronze medal after nipping teammate Molly Huddle at the line. For Emily, the performance was both an eye-opener and a game-changer.

Worlds really gave me the confidence to run with anyone and put myself in a good position in the race, she says. I learned to push myself out of my comfort zoneonly then could you have the possibility to truly surprise yourself and achieve something great. I would rather go after a fast time in a race and die than not give myself a shot.

Infeld took some down time in the fall before resuming full training for this Olympic year. Things have been going well since December, she says, in part because of new Bowerman Track Club members.



It has been great with the addition of Shelby Houlihan, Colleen Quigley and Betsy Saina to the group, Infeld says. We havent overlapped with Amy Hastings or Shalane for more than easy runs in their buildup [to last Saturdays Olympic Marathon Trials], but it is great having them around to look up to and learn from.

Infeld is well aware that there will be no more surprise performances now that she has a medal from a global championships. Shes using that recognition as another source of motivation as she launches her 2016 campaign.

I definitely feel pressure, especially as a lot of people think I lucked into the medal because the race was slow, Infeld says. I want to prove that I can run fast times and be competitive with the best at their best, not just in a tactical race.

I have definitely upped my training game and am very motivated this year, she says. That being said, I know that you need consistency in training in order to make big leaps, so I am being cautious in the sense that I want to ensure I can get to the start line healthy. Getting through [coach] Jerry [Schumacher]s training is grueling, and I know he can get me to maximize my potential as an athlete, but I have to be smart and listen to my body.

Trott, who won the non-Olympic scratch race on Thursday, enhanced her advantage with a mature display in the concluding points race to claim Britain's fourth gold of the five-day competition at the Lee Valley VeloPark where she won two Olympic gold medals in 2012.

The 23-year-old from Cheshunt now has seven world titles, three individual crowns and a first omnium world title since 2012, when she went on to win Olympic gold. She will hope for a repeat in Rio in August.

Trott finished with 201 points and France's Laurie Berthon claimed silver on the last of 10 sprints in the points race to beat Sarah Hammer of the United States by one point. Berthon finished with 183 points to Hammer's 182.

Kenny, the sprint champion on Saturday and Trott's fiance, sat up on the final lap of the men's Keirin, won by Germany's Joachim Eilers, with an apparent mechanical problem.

He completed the race, finishing sixth as Ed Dawkins of New Zealand took silver and Awang Azizulhasni of Malaysia bronze.

Kenny had won the Keirin title in 2013, but was unable to reclaim the rainbow jersey as Trott pulled on the one for omnium champion for the first time in four years.

She has long targeted Sir Chris Hoy's British record haul of six Olympic gold medals and moved within four of his World Championship tally of 11 with the victory.

""I love the number seven - I can retire happy now,"" said Trott, who has four team pursuit world titles to her name and won bronze in the event on Friday.

""I might be able to do four in one go, because I could do the omnium, the team pursuit, the points race and the scratch.""

Trott had 184 points entering the concluding points race after consolidating her advantage in the fourth and fifth disciplines.

Trott was third in the 500metres time-trial and Hammer, the joint overnight leader, 10th. It meant Trott opened up a 14-point lead ahead of the flying lap, the penultimate discipline.

Trott was third and Hammer fifth, but Berthon's second second place of the morning bumped her up to second overall.

The Briton won the first and fifth sprints to take a near unassailable lead which she protected to the finish.

Trott said: ""I'm just so happy. It's taken me four years to get a gold medal back in the omnium. It was just incredible.

""Last night I went to bed and I didn't really know what was going to happen. I was a little disappointed that I didn't win the elimination race.

""I rode stupidly. I should've taken Sarah down to the black line and I didn't. I took her up and I kept it fast. That is something that she's good at. I couldn't match her.

""(I was) not angry, just disappointed. Elimination race is my thing. I really enjoy that event. I felt like the wind had been blown out of my sails a little bit.

""I had such a high after Jason won the sprint that I was buzzing and after that, I was 'oh, okay'.

""Today it was a new day, I woke up feeling really positive.""

Trott was pleased with her points race performance.

She added: ""I felt so good in that. Paul (Manning, her coach) had said to me before the start 'take out the first points and you'll feel confident, you'll feel comfortable'.

""That's exactly what I did. After that I could ride my own race. I wasn't really bothered about what was going on with Sarah and Laurie because they were having their own battle.""",[]

espn.com,,New York Giants adding 'high-risk/high-reward' CB in Janoris Jenkins,['Dan Graziano'],"The first day of the new NFL league year began with ESPN's Adam Schefter reporting that the New York Giants were in agreement with free-agent cornerback Janoris Jenkins on a five-year, $62.5 million contract. Jenkins will replace fellow free agent Prince Amukamara as a starting Giants cornerback alongside Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. To look at what the Giants can expect to get from their big new investment, I spoke with ESPN's Matt Bowen, himself a former NFL defensive back. His opinion is that Jenkins will make things exciting.

Graziano: The Giants are giving Janoris Jenkins a whopper of a contract in free agency. What do you think they see in him?

Bowen: With Jenkins, the Giants see a cornerback with natural coverage skills, closing speed and playmaking ability. Jenkins can play off-man, walk up in press and has the speed to match the vertical passing game. Plus, with his ball skills, the Giants get a cornerback who can flip the field, create scoring position and change the course of the game when he finishes plays. This is an aggressive cornerback who isnt afraid to challenge (or even sit) on routes. He is going to drive on the throw.

Graziano: All sounds great. But, while you say ""aggressive,"" the word I hear most often about Jenkins is that he ""gambles"" too much in coverage, and that has been a drawback for him in the past. Do you see too much of that when you watch him?

Bowen: Jenkins is the classic high risk/high reward cornerback. He is going to jump routes and make plays, but that also opens up the door for opponents to game plan his style with double-moves or multiple breaking routes. This is where we see the negative on Jenkins. At times, he lacks eye discipline and will get caught playing with poor technique (footwork). Because of that, I dont feel Jenkins has reached his ceiling yet at the position. Is he going to make big plays for the Giants? No doubt. But is he also going to get caught with his eyes in the backfield in certain situations? Yes. And thats the trade-off for New York.

Graziano: One of the things the Giants liked about last years CB tandem was the contrasting styles between Rodgers-Cromartie and Amukamara. They felt they could play sides with them because, if the opponent moved its top receiver around, they would be giving him a different look every time he switched. One of my initial concerns here is whether DRC and Jenkins are too similar in style. Do you agree with that concern or think it matters?

Bowen: Thats a fair point, but there is nothing better than cornerbacks who can challenge opposing receivers in man-coverage situations. That means more pressure from the Giants and the ability to play specific matchups based on the opponent scouting report. Even with two similar skill sets, the Giants will set their game plan to maximize the talent of both Jenkins and DRC. Play man, roll to Cover 2 and allow these cornerbacks to get up on wide receivers. Start dictating outside of the numbers. To do that, you need two cornerbacks, like Jenkins and DRC, who have the skill set to impact the release of wide receivers.

Graziano: I feel like this is an obvious question, but does that make it even more important that the Giants shore up the free safety position, not to mention the pass-rush? Is a DRC/Jenkins combo the kind of cornerback duo that can shut down a passing game on its own, or do they need to have strong support on the back end in order to play the way they want to play?

Bowen: Rush and coverage is a two-way street. No cornerback, regardless of skill set or speed, is going to lock guys down on every single play. Thats fantasy world. The Giants must continue to upgrade the front four pass rush (especially in nickel situations) through free agency and the draft. You want Jenkins and DRC to make big pays? Then force the ball to come out. Let them jump the slant or take away the fade. Plus, the free safety is vital to any man-coverage defense. The Giants need that angel over the top of the defense, the gatekeeper in the post to allow both Jenkins and DRC to funnel receivers to the middle of the field and also to ""save"" them when they get over-aggressive (which they will). Still a lot of work to do in New York to upgrade this defense. Adding Jenkins, a young cornerback in his prime years, is a start. But no one is going to cover consistently for six or seven seconds while the quarterback sits in the pocket.

Graziano: The Giants are just getting started in free agency, with a lot of work still left to do. Thanks, Matt!",[]
espn.com,,U.S. Olympic Team Trials Marathon showcases L.A.'s readiness for 2024 Olympic bid,"['Andrew Hood', 'Sarah Gearhart', 'Competitor Com', 'Rico Longoria', 'Phil Gaimon', 'Roger Robinson', 'Doug Williams', 'Pa Sport', 'Mario Fraioli', 'Caley Fretz']","LOS ANGELES -- As Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti stood before a crowd outside the Los Angeles Convention Center on Saturday morning prior to the start of the U.S. Olympic Team Trials Marathon, he smiled as he looked around at the palm trees lining the streets and the sun-kissed glass facade of the convention center on a picturesque 75-degree day.

The marathon's results will help determine the first batch of track and field athletes to qualify for the 2016 U.S. Olympic team that will compete this summer in Rio de Janeiro, but Garcetti couldn't help but think ahead eight years, when he hopes Los Angeles will host the 2024 Summer Games.

""What do you guys think? Do you want to bring the Olympics back to American soil?"" Garcetti asked the cheering crowd before the race. ""Let's bring it back for a third time! Let's bring the Olympics back home! Let's do it in 2024!""

Los Angeles, which hosted the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympics, is one of four candidate cities, along with Budapest, Paris and Rome, to host the 2024 Games. The host city will be chosen on Sept. 13, 2017, but Los Angeles believes it is already well on its way to building an Olympic city long before the International Olympic Committee holds its election next year in Lima, Peru.

Goucher: 'Justice will come' in Salazar drug probe Marathon runner Kara Goucher said ""justice will come"" in the ongoing doping investigation of her former coach Alberto Salazar, who has denied any wrongdoing. 1 Related

Whether or not Los Angeles is chosen as the host city, ground will be broken later this year on a nearly $3 billion world-class football stadium in Inglewood, which will be the new home of the Los Angeles Rams, and on a $250 million soccer stadium on the site of the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, which will be the new home of Los Angeles FC, an expansion Major League Soccer team. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum will also undergo a nearly $300 million renovation beginning next year. All of the stadiums are expected to be completed by 2019.

In addition to those facilities, over the past three years, the Rose Bowl has undergone a $182 million renovation; UCLA's Pauley Pavilion underwent a $136 million makeover; The Forum got a $100 million facelift, and even new facilities such as the Staples Center and StubHub Center have gotten a combined $25 million worth of upgrades and touchups, maintaining their status as premier homes in the NBA, NHL and MLS.

""The stars are aligning,"" LA 2024 Chairman Casey Wasserman told ESPN. ""We are thrilled that the Rams will be returning to Los Angeles and playing in a brand new, state-of-the-art stadium in Inglewood, bringing exciting possibilities for its use in 2024. The wealth of existing and planned infrastructure in Los Angeles means LA 2024 has the luxury of selecting the best choices for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, not building them from scratch.

""And this extends to more than just outstanding sports venues. For decades, L.A. has been making the strategic investments in to make our city Olympic-ready, including the largest transit construction program in the United States, making our city greener, more liveable and better connected than ever before by 2024.""

Los Angeles has long been criticized for a lack of a mass transit system, but that will change later this year when the Expo Line, a 15.2-mile, $2.5 billion light-rail line, will connect Downtown Los Angeles to Downtown Santa Monica. LAX airport will also begin a massive overhaul and renovation later this year, which will include a consolidated rental car center, a people-mover train and access to the under-construction Crenshaw Line light rail, which will be completed by 2023 for about $5 billion. From new sports facilities to groundbreaking transportation lines, Los Angeles is in the midst of a renaissance completely independent of its Olympic bid.

""We can offer a bid that not only doesn't go into debt, but everything is going to be used long after the Olympics and will already be built before the Olympics,"" Garcetti told ESPN. ""It's all new facilities since the 1984 Olympics with the exception of the Coliseum, which will be upgraded and has the history. We're talking about cutting-edge facilities such as the stadium in Inglewood, which will be the most expensive and most technologically advanced stadium ever built. The Olympics want a more sustainable model for host cities, and Los Angeles is the perfect embodiment of that. More than 85 percent of our venues are already built or will be built regardless of whether we have the Olympics. We are fitting the plan for the Olympic Games to our city, not the other way around.""

The LA 2024 bid calls for UCLA's modern residences to serve as its Olympic Village with USC, which is currently building a 15-acre, $700 million mixed-use ""University Village"" slated to be completed by 2018, as its Media Village. Both schools have also recently built several athletic and training facilities on campus, including the $147 million Galen Center and $70 million John McKay Center at USC, and the $70 million Wasserman Football Center and Mo Ostin Basketball Center at UCLA, which broke ground last year.

Both schools housed Olympians during the 1984 Summer Games and between them have produced 821 Olympians (423 for USC, 398 for UCLA) and 539 Olympic medals (USC 288; UCLA 251). Their combined Olympic medals account for more than 20 percent of all U.S. medals.

On Saturday, the U.S. Olympic Team Trials course took marathon runners through the USC campus, past the Coliseum -- which was the home of the opening and closing ceremonies of the 1932 and 1984 Summer Games -- and alongside a spectator-lined Olympic Blvd., which was originally called 10th Street, but renamed after the 1932 Olympics, the 10th Olympiad. Wasserman and Garcetti are hoping that history combined with a new-look Los Angeles will propel the city to join London as the only cities to host the Olympics three times.

""We are so excited that Los Angeles has played host to so many chapters in Olympics history, and we hope to soon write another chapter,"" Garcetti said. ""Los Angeles has the capacity, infrastructure, people and experience to make it happen. We have the strongest package in the world. This is a town that has been home to more Olympic athletes than any place on the face of the Earth.""

When the race was over, runners walked on red carpets set up outside of the convention center for the Grammy Awards, which will take place Monday night at the Staples Center. Before the end of the month, the arena will also host 10 Lakers, Clippers and Kings games in 12 days, all of which are sold out. As much as Saturday's Olympic team trials and Sunday's L.A. Marathon will be used as a showcase for Los Angeles' Olympic bid, the city is constantly juggling world-class events from sports and entertainment, proving it is more than capable of hosting the Olympics.

""It certainly elevates the 2024 bid by showing how well we can do these sorts of events,"" Garcetti said. ""As was the Special Olympics World Games last year, or having a Lakers or Clippers game following a Kings game at Staples Center the same day there's a USC football game at the Coliseum. L.A. knows how to get this done, and a lot of cities can't pull that off logistically. We know how to do this.""",[]
espn.com,,"Jets lose Chris Ivory to Jaguars, and the free-agent exodus is underway","['Rich Cimini', 'Steve Palazzolo']","ESPN Jets reporter Rich Cimini says New York is expected to lose their leading rusher to the Jaguars, increasing the importance of retaining Bilal Powell, another free agent, and drafting a running back. (1:46)

Brace yourself, New York Jets fans. The next few days could be painful.

The free-agent exodus started Tuesday night, with the news that running back Chris Ivory will sign with the Jacksonville Jaguars, as ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter reported. The move cannot be made official until 4 p.m. ET Wednesday, when the new league year begins.

Ivory won't be the last to take someone else's money and run. Nose tackle Damon Harrison probably will be next, and he could be followed by Bilal Powell, Ivory's sidekick. Ryan Fitzpatrick, too, will hit the open market on Wednesday, but the team remains optimistic it can re-sign their starting quarterback.

Welcome to the Jets' new world. A year ago, it was spend and sign. This year, the cap room is almost dried up.

When the season ended, the Jets knew they'd be hard pressed t0 re-sign Ivory. Why? The usual reasons: Cap restraints, his age (28 on March 22), the devaluation of the running back position and so on. It wasn't a matter of if; it was just of matter of who and how much.

The answers: The Jaguars and an obscene amount of money. The official breakdown of Ivory's contract wasn't immediately available, but one source said it was north of $6 million a year. The APY ranks sixth among running backs, according to ESPN research.

No disrespect to Ivory, a tough, hard-working player who maximized a career year, but he's not worth $6 million a year -- at least not to the Jets. There are variables to consider, such as the amount of guaranteed money and the structure of the deal, but $6 million is $6 million.

Ivory is an older back with one 1,000-yard rushing season on his resume and a history of nagging injuries. Coach Todd Bowles was so concerned about Ivory's sore knee leading into the Week 17 showdown at the Buffalo Bills that he took him out of the starting lineup and made him the third-down back.

The Jets had to let him go, and anybody who believes otherwise simply doesn't understand the economics of football.

The crazy part of Ivory's departure? Former Jets general manager John Idzik was the man behind the scenes in Jacksonville, pulling the strings. He's the Jaguars' assistant GM/cap expert. The smartest personnel move he made during his ill-fated, two-year tenure in New York was trading for Ivory in 2013 and signing him to a team-friendly contract -- $6 million over three years. Now he steals his guy from the Jets, except the bill is a whole lot bigger than the last time.

For the Jets, the question is, how do they respond? First, they need to re-sign Powell, but that's hardly a gimme. Powell has several suitors and there's a good chance he'll be a goner, too, throwing the Jets into a full-blown crisis at running back. The only experienced back under contract is Zac Stacy, and he's coming off a broken leg.

Even if Powell stays, the Jets will sign a veteran running back and look to add another in next month's draft. Bowles likes to go three-deep at the position, and right now he's knee-deep in uncertainty. Alfred Morris, an Ivory-style runner, is a possibility. He's 27 years old, and would be a good fit. Arian Foster could be a down-the-line option. There's always the draft. If Ohio State's Ezekiel Elliott falls to the Jets, picking 20th, he'd be hard to pass up.

The inevitable free-agent exodus has commenced. Let's see how GM Mike Maccagnan responds.",[]
espn.com,,USOC forms infectious disease panel to address Zika concerns,"['Espn Staff', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Adriana Terrazas', 'Bonnie D']","DENVER -- An infectious disease specialist from the University of Utah will chair a group formed by the U.S. Olympic Committee to address concerns about the Zika virus and other health issues at the Rio de Janeiro Games this summer.

Carrie Byington will head the group that will establish best practices for those in the U.S. Olympic delegation traveling to Brazil. The mosquito-borne virus is an epidemic in Central and Latin America; the World Health Organization has declared it a global health emergency.

Zika causes mild illness or no symptoms in most people but is believed to be linked to a birth defect that causes babies to be born with unusually small heads.

USOC CEO Scott Blackmun said health and safety are his priorities for the U.S. delegation in Rio 2016. Kyle Terada/USA TODAY Sports

The USOC panel will develop educational material and be available to offer updates and create plans for athletes who become ill.

Also on the panel are Randy Taplitz of University of California-San Diego and Capt. Martin S. Cetron from the Centers for Disease Control.

""The health and safety of our athletes, and our entire delegation, is our top priority,"" said USOC CEO Scott Blackmun.

But the USOC came under scrutiny earlier this year when some U.S. athletes questioned whether they might travel to Brazil for the Olympics.

Most notably, U.S. soccer player Hope Solo said if the Olympics were being held now, she wouldn't go.

The USOC responded by sending a letter to members of its delegation emphasizing the federation's concern about the virus. It publicized a page on its website -- USOC.org/RioTravelUpdates -- where it would post the most recent news on Zika and other health-related concerns.

The CDC's most recent advice, issued last week, was for pregnant women to consider not going and for their male sexual partners to use condoms after the trip or abstain from sex during the pregnancy.

The CDC also recommends that all travelers use insect repellent while in outbreak areas and continue to use it for three weeks after travel in case they might be infected but not sick.

The Olympics will be held Aug. 5-21, which is winter in Brazil, and mosquitoes aren't expected to be as abundant.

Still, America sends the largest delegation -- one filled with stars, some of whom have already voiced their opinions.

Editor's Picks Despite Zika, Phelps OK with family in Rio Despite an outbreak of the Zika virus, Michael Phelps says his fiancee and newborn son will accompany him to the Rio Olympics.

Earlier this week, Michael Phelps told The Associated Press that he'll travel to Brazil, along with his fiancee and their newborn son.

""We're not worried about it,"" Phelps said. ""I think if you go into any Olympics, there's always something that comes up.""

The International Olympic Committee has distributed guidance to all the Olympic teams. The USOC is monitoring that advice, and making members of the new panel available to its athletes.

""Our in-house medical team are some of the best in the world at what they do, but having access to, and relying upon, the kind of outside expertise represented by this advisory group is just another way we can make sure our athletes and staff have what they need to be well and compete at a high level,"" said the USOC's managing director of sports medicine, Bill Moreau.",[]
espn.com,,Raising the question of Jordan Spieth's spit to a higher power at WGC-Cadillac Championship at Trump National Doral,"['Bob Harig', 'Michael Collins', 'Pa Sport', 'Jason Sobel']","DORAL, Fla. -- This is a story about spit.

Well, not just any spit -- Jordan Spieth's spit, and the legal questions over whether it can be applied to the bottom of his putter.

Let's allow Spieth himself to explain, as he did following a third-round 73 at the WGC-Cadillac Championship on Saturday.

""On the practice green,"" he said, ""if it gets shiny and we don't have a rag there, I'll lick my thumb and put it over the sole of the putter, because when it has moisture on it, it sets on the ground better.""

He has stopped short, however, of ever employing that method during competition, because he wasn't sure whether it was legal.

Early in his round, he inquired as to whether he could use the thumb-lick in a tournament.

""I had to ask an official once I realized the course was like that today,"" he said. ""I realized it on No. 2; I just couldn't get set. Maybe because my putter is older, maybe because it's rounded on the bottom, but it glides on the grass when it's shiny. On bentgrass, it sticks to it; on Bermuda and sometimes on fescue, if it's firmer, you can almost fall over if you use it to anchor yourself.""

On the third hole, he summoned a PGA Tour rules official.

""He said, 'What are your intentions?' and I told him, 'My intentions are to make it easier to set the putter down.' I'd never done it before, because my intentions are for it to help me, but if I can do it, then I'm going to.""

It took about five holes, but when the rules official reported back to Spieth, he admitted that there was a split decision among his colleagues.

So they appealed to a higher authority.

""They called the USGA,"" Spieth said. ""I don't know what exactly happened, but he came back to me on No. 8 and said they were still going to talk about it further, but for now they were going to rule that I can't do it.""

Spieth seemed amused that he had a rules issue that nobody could seem to figure out.

""It was a bit interesting to stump everyone,"" he said. ""But I had asked a dozen people and nobody knew the answer.""

After the lengthy post-round explanation of exactly what he'd been asking and what the decision was, he smiled and offered an assessment of his putting -- spit or no spit.

""I still didn't make a putt today.""",[]

On stage, he stands 6 feet, 5 inches, easily the tallest player on any top-tier Dota 2 team. He has shed the Fabio-style locks he sported early in his career for a distinctive, cerebral mien, his brown hair (just a hint of curls now) close-cropped and wide face dominated by professorial glasses.

But it is in game where his visage is most distinctive, and where his list of accomplishments truly towers over competitors. He has won 299 career games (maps) in pro Dota 2 LAN events, fourth most all-time and more than 60 more than the next closest Western player. Of the 28 players on that list with more than 200 wins, only three, Ivanov and fellow super-captains Zhang ""Xiao8"" Ning and Gustav ""s4"" Magnusson, boast win rates of better than 65 percent. Of the seven Valve-sponsored Dota 2 tournaments since the game's birth (four Internationals held in Seattle, one in Germany and, new this year, two Majors in Frankfurt and Shanghai), Puppey has appeared in an incredible five grand finals, two more than any other player (his former Natus Vincere teammates Danil ""Dendi"" Ishutin and Alexander ""XBOCT"" Dashkevich have three each).

Early on Sunday, March 6, Ivanov stood on stage in Shanghai and held aloft a trophy fashioned in the likeness of a crystal Mystic Staff to the delight of a roaring Chinese crowd. It is his 34th pro Dota 2 tournament win, more than any other active player (Gustav ""s4"" Magnusson has 32). It is quite possibly his most unlikely. And it is this win that makes him, almost undoubtedly by a wide margin, the greatest captain in professional Dota 2 history.

The all-stars that weren't

It wasn't supposed to happen this way. Eight months ago, Team Secret stormed into Seattle as near-prohibitive favorites at The International 2015, which at more than $18 million boasted by far the richest prize pool in esports history. Their roster was a professional Dota 2 all-star team, featuring, at the time, the four highest win percentage players ever with 100-plus Dota 2 LAN games played (Ivanov, Magnusson, Artour ""Arteezy"" Babaev and Ludwig ""Zai"" Wahlberg). Secret's fifth player, Kuro Salehi ""KuroKy"" Takhasomi, had been Puppey's support partner for two years with Na'Vi, and founded Team Secret with Puppey after the pair's departure following TI4.

""Against the odds, Secret become the most consistently successful team in last year's post-TI period.""

Kuroky is himself considered one of the most versatile players and finest leaders on the professional scene, and his career is linked inextricably with Puppey's. Coming into TI5, Secret had won an unprecedented four straight LAN events in three months against international competition.

Their run began in San Francisco with a dramatic 3-2 victory at the RedBull Battle Grounds against Invictus Gaming. Their roster at the time featured arguably the most decorated carry (Xu ""BurNIng"" Zhilei), mid (Luo ""Ferrari 430"" Feichi) and support duo (Wong Hock ""ChuaN"" and Zeng ""Faith"" Hongda) in Chinese Dota 2 history. The streak culminated in Germany with a dominating 3-1 win at ESL One Frankfurt over an Evil Geniuses squad that just months before won the Dota 2 Asia Championships, at more than $3 million the largest prize pool ever outside of The International. By late July, Dota 2 fans and analysts alike virtually vibrated with expectations of a Secret vs. EG rematch in the TI5 final.

The rematch never materialized. Plagued by drafting and personal issues, Secret suffered a lopsided 2-0 defeat to rising Chinese power EHOME in the winner's bracket of the main event. After clawing out a 2-1 win over the same iG squad they'd beaten in May, they were upset 2-1 by CIS team Virtus Pro, which put up little resistance in a 2-0 series loss to LGD. Arteezy, viewed by many as the most talented player in the game, appeared to engage in a shouting match with KuroKy on stage inside the team's booth. Secret, the presumptive favorites, left the main event as barely a footnote, with only three wins in eight matches, finishing in a tie for seventh place in a 16-team field.

The aftermath of TI5 was, if anything, even more devastating for Secret and its fans than their failed tournament run. Post-mortems focused around questions about the team's leadership. S4 had taken over drafting responsibilities from Puppey earlier in the summer, which at the time seemed to key the team's remarkable LAN run. After TI5, arguably his poorest career performance on a major stage, s4 was released from the team. He eventually resumed leadership of the Alliance squad he captained to victory over Puppey's Na'Vi team at The International 2013. In a shocking announcement, Zai, regarded by some as a talent equal to or perhaps even greater than Arteezy, declared he would take time off from competitive Dota 2 to finish school. Arteezy and KuroKy continued their conflict after the tournament, escalating on streams and social media. Artour soon announced his return to Evil Geniuses, while Kuro left the team to assemble a promising young roster that would eventually become the current Team Liquid. Of the five all-stars, only Puppey remained.

Valve

For all his accomplishments to that point, Puppey faced serious questions about his record as captain. Though a champion of the first International in 2011, Puppey had joined Natus Vincere only months before, leaving a GG.net team he'd shared with KuroKy (who would later rejoin Puppey on Na'Vi's roster prior to TI3).

Na'Vi were given their Dota 2 beta keys only three weeks before the event, and Ivan ""Artstyle"" Antonov, not Puppey, captained the team in their spectacular undefeated TI1 run. Despite leading Na'Vi to two more back-to-back Internationals Grand Finals in 2012 and 2013, Puppey's squad would lose both series, 3-1 to iG and 3-2 to Alliance. Puppey's signature drafting style, often deliberately allowing opposing teams to pick their signature heroes or strategies, was criticized following both events.

The year before, in 2014, Puppey had captained a fractured Na'Vi squad to a seventh/eighth-place finish in a 16-team field, losing to a Cloud9 squad captained by Jacky ""EternaLEnVy"" Mao and stabilized by Johan ""pieliedie"" Astrom's steady support play. It would be Puppey's final series with Na'Vi; he and KuroKy announced their departures immediately after the event, founding Team Secret shortly thereafter. In the nearly two years since, Na'Vi has never again found the level of success they enjoyed with Puppey on their roster. TI5 marked Puppey's second straight seventh/eighth-place finish at The International. And, for a second straight year, his team fell apart afterward.

Rebuilding turned reloading

Following TI5, Team Secret embarked on what many assumed would be a lengthy rebuilding phase. Puppey recruited former C9 teammates pieliedie, EternaLEnVy, and Rasmus ""MiSeRy"" Filipsen, and, after allegedly being turned down by at least one (possibly several) more prominent players, settled on Aliwi ""w33"" Omar to play the critical mid-lane role. While the previous Team Secret was an all-star team, this roster was far from decorated. EnVy and MiSeRy had disappointed themselves at TI5, finishing in the bottom half of the field on a C9 squad that, despite being highly rated by many coming into the tournament, failed to win a single match at the main event.

""For all his accomplishments to that point, Puppey faced serious questions about his record as captain.""

EternalEnVy, ""EE-sama"" to his fans, is himself one of the most colorful and controversial figures in pro Dota 2. If he, in some ways, epitomizes the gamer stereotype (he is a self-described Otaku, extreme introvert, and often socially awkward). He also typifies the other, usually untold part of that stereotype: He's a tremendously smart former engineering student with a singular focus and an impressive analytical mind. EnVy's career began in 2012 with the founding of No Tidehunter, a talented but relatively unseasoned squad.

Shortly after their first public appearances, their roster featured four Swedish stars, including s4, and the Canadian EnVy. Despite surprising success, with first-place finishes in five of the eight Dota 2 tournaments in which they competed, EnVy was released from the roster in February 2013. Six weeks later, the then all-Swedish roster renamed itself Alliance and dominated The International 2013, going 20-1 in the tournament before triumphing 3-2 against Puppey's Na'Vi in the Grand Finals.

Widely perceived as a phenomenal talent, EternalEnVy remained a polarizing figure. At the time he joined Secret, he had only one career victory in a major LAN, which came in late 2013 at MLG Columbus, and was a coming out party for budding young superstar Arteezy, who played as a last-minute stand-in for the team and showed dominant individual form. The team, sponsored officially several months later by Cloud9, became (in)famous for a string of second-place finishes in high-profile tournaments. Though subsequently praised by teammates for his leadership role on Cloud9, EnVy's individual numbers were mediocre at best for a top carry-position player, and his individual in-game decisions were labeled inconsistent by many critics.

Secret's other three acquisitions also stirred debate among pro Dota 2 insiders. MiSeRy, a veteran player who entered the pro Dota scene in 2008 and served a brief stint with Secret in late 2014 and early 2015, was himself the subject of controversy after the announcement that he would be switching to the difficult off-lane role after several years playing mostly support.

Pieliedie, who had been replaced by MiSeRy on Cloud9's roster in January 2015, had also played professional Dota since the late 2000s, but like EnVy, the MLG Columbus win with EnVy and Artour was by far the biggest on his resume. W33, a 20-year old Syrian-born Romanian citizen, was known to many (perhaps even most) fans by the derisive nickname ""w33fresh,"" gained after an unfortunate cheating incident in a high-level European in-house league match earlier in the year (the game was a ""vouching match,"" viewed by some players as a formality, and did not impact standings in the league).

Steffie Wunderl/ESL

Against the odds, Secret became the most consistently successful team in last year's post-TI period. After their new roster's controversial direct invite to ESL: New York in October, the squad defeated FNATIC and TI5 runners-up CDEC, falling 2-1 in the finals to the surprising young CIS team, Vega Squadron. W33 showed flashes of real brilliance on Windrunner as well as his signature Meepo. MiSeRy's initially shaky off-lane play quickly solidified, with his stellar Slardar play cementing the hero throughout the scene as one of the top picks in the off-lane role.

EnVy, seemingly beginning to realize the potential many had seen in him, nearly single-handedly brought Ember Spirit back into the metagame as a viable safe lane carry, compiling a gaudy 17-4 record on the hero. Secret followed their second-place showing in New York with back-to-back wins at elite international LANs: over top Chinese team Vici Gaming at the Nanyang Championships and over TI5 Champion Evil Geniuses at the MLG World Finals in New Orleans. Pieliedie's support play is as steady as ever, and the notoriously stoic Swede finally shows joy on stage, wrapping Puppey in a bear hug after the team's win in Nanyang. Despite the latter's previous captaincy, Puppey, not EnVy, is the undisputed leader of the team, which showed consistent excellence in both drafting and in-game decision-making, the twin calling cards of the game's great captains.

By November, Secret, unbelievably, once again sat atop the Dota 2 world. They are again the favorites (perhaps co-favorites with EG), this time at the Frankfurt Major, the first-ever Dota 2 Valve-sponsored tournament, besides the first International, held outside of Seattle (aside/footnote: The Dota 2 Asia Championships, held early in 2015, were hosted by Valve's Chinese distribution partner Perfect World). And this time, they don't disappoint. They finished at the top of their group, and roll through the winner's bracket, reprising their victories over VG and EG in dramatic 2-1 series.

They played beautiful Dota, dominating on the same heroes who won them two straight events, with a few surprises, including EnVy's Huskar and pieliedie support Tiny, thrown in to wow the German crowd. By the event's final day, they sat awaiting the winner of EG vs. OG in the lower-bracket final. OG, like Secret a talented roster formed in the wake of TI5, featured Johan ""BigDaddyN0tail"" Sundstein and Tal ""Fly"" Aizik, two of the founding members of Team Secret with Puppey and KuroKy, as well as budding young superstar Amer ""Miracle"" al-Barqawi, an 8k MMR pub phenom rumored to have been among the most desirable players in the post-TI5 roster scramble.

Once again, it is not to be for Puppey and his squad. OG stun EG in the loser's bracket final, 2-1, denying a much anticipated rematch. The Grand Finals quickly turned sour for Secret, with their support Tiny strategy failing disastrously in the opening match in a 32-minute loss. Game 2 is hard-fought, and at more than 65 minutes the third longest of the event, but OG prevail behind Miracle on Alchemist.

Secret managed to beat Miracle's already near-legendary Shadow Fiend in game 3, but OG go back to it in Game 4, and this time, Secret run out of answers. Like the opening match, Game 4 ends before 35 minutes, and OG become the Frankfurt Major Champions. The three ex-Cloud9 players on Secret's roster once again finished in second place. It is the third time (in only five tries) that Puppey has captained a team to the Grand Finals of a multimillion-dollar Valve sponsored event. It was also his third straight loss.

El novato del 2015 de la NASCAR Xfinity Series, el mexicano Daniel Suarez, no cree que su carrera en el serial este en peligro luego de que Brian France, presidente de la mencionada organizacion, haya expresado su apoyo a Donald Trump para la presidencia de Estados Unidos.

El volante del equipo Joe Gibbs Racing, quien esta segundo en la serie este ano, dijo el viernes que no presta mucha atencion a la politica y en un principio no se habia dado cuenta de que algunos pilotos de NASCAR y el presidente de la misma aparecieron el lunes en un evento de la gira proselitista de Trump.

Trump enojo a la comunidad mexicana al decir en junio: ""Cuando Mexico manda gente (a Estados Unidos), no manda a los mejores. Manda a gente que tiene muchos problemas y nos traen esos problemas. Traen drogas. Traen crimen. Son violadores"".

Suarez no cree que haya alguna reaccion negativa hacia France de parte de los patrocinadores o fans de NASCAR.

""Estoy muy orgulloso de todo el trabajo, todo el apoyo que he recibido en NASCAR, de los Estados Unidos"", dijo Suarez despues de la practica de la Xfinity Series en Las Vegas Motorspeedway. ""Y honestamente estoy muy orgulloso de ser mexicano, de ser un piloto latinoamericano, de ser un latinoamericano, porque si no fuera mexicano quien sabe si tuviera todo el apoyo que tengo de NASCAR y Estados Unidos"".

Suarez es patrocinado por Carlos Slim y sus empresas, las cuales dejaron de tener negocios con Trump luego de que el aspirante republicano emitiera sus declaraciones.

Last week, many of the masked men proved crucial for their teams, while a few uncharacteristically struggled at the most inopportune time. Heres a look back at some of those performances.

A step up

Ben Bishop, Tampa Bay Lightning: The netminder extended his personal winning streak to six games with a 24-save performance during a 4-3 win in overtime over the Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday. It was Tampas record-setting ninth straight win. Overall, hes 28-17-3 with a 2.06 goals-against average and a .926 save percentage in 49 games this season.

Joonas Korpisalo, Columbus Blue Jackets: The rookie goalie is getting an opportunity to showcase his skills and thats exactly what hes been doing of late. He made 33 saves to help the Blue Jackets to a 6-3 win over the Edmonton Oilers on Friday. Hes 4-1-0 in his past five games and improved to 13-8-4, with a 2.61 GAA and a .918 save percentage, this season.

Matt Niskanen, Washington Capitals: Provided the game-winning goal at 2:36 of overtime to lead the Capitals to a 2-1 win over the Boston Bruins on Saturday. It was his third gamer-winner this season, and all have come since Feb. 7. He has four points in the past six games.

A step down

Petr Mrazek, Detroit Red Wings: The goalie witnessed firsthand the domination of the Blackhawks. On Wednesday, Mrazek allowed five goals on 33 shots as Chicago posted a 5-2 win. On Sunday, the Blackhawks Patrick Kane scored 21 second into the game and Chicago led a 2-0 lead at 6:19 of the first after Mrazek allowed two goals on the first tive shots he faced. Jimmy Howard then replaced Mrazek.

Dylan Larkin, Detroit Red Wings: The rookie sensation has cooled off a bit recently. The forward has only one goal and one assist in the past 11 games. Overall, he has 19 goals and 20 assists in 63 games.

WESTERN CONFERENCE

A step up

Frederik Andersen, Anaheim Ducks: His 32-save performance during Saturdays 3-2 win over the Los Angeles Kings matched a career-high with his seventh consecutive victory. Andersen has earned at least one point in 15 straight games with a 13-0-2 record in that span.

Connor McDavid, Edmonton Oilers: The rookie posted a goal and assist during Fridays 6-3 loss to the Blue Jackets. He missed 37 games earlier this season due to a broken collarbone, but since returning to the lineup on Feb. 2, McDavid has eight goals and 14 assists in 18 games. Despite missing all those games, he is tied for sixth among rookies with 13 goals and 21 assists for 34 points.

Mark Scheifele, Winnipeg Jets: Registered his first career hat trick to help the Jets to a 4-2 victory over the Montreal Canadiens on Saturday. It was also his second straight multi-goal game. Hes reached the 20-goal plateau for the first time.

Filip Forsberg, Nashville Predators: He has 14 goals in the past 14 games and his performances are a big reason why the Predators have gone 12 games without a regulation loss, posting an 8-0-4 record during that span.

Cam Talbot, Edmonton Oilers: He went 3-0-0 with a shutout, a 0.65 goals-against average and a .981 save percentage last week. Talbot posted wins over the Sabres (31 saves), Flyers (35 saves in a 4-0 shutout) and Jets (39 saves).

A step down

Tyler Seguin, Dallas Stars: One of the top point producers in the league, Seguin has now gone four straight games without a point, which matches a season-high pointless skid. The Stars are 2-3-1 in their last six games. Overall, Seguin has 32 goals and 36 assists in 67 games this season.

Johnny Gaudreau, Calgary Flames: This is the first time his been in this category this season. The Flames are 1-6-1 in their past eight games, and Gaudreau has gone three games without a point and has only one assist in the last four games. He recently produced a 12-game point streak with three goals and nine assists for 12 points, but hes been held off the score sheet the past three.",[]
espn.com,,How did Phil Jackson approach free agency last offseason and how will he do it this year,"['Tim Macmahon', 'Anthony Olivieri', 'Dave Mcmenamin', 'Ian Begley']","ESPN New York's Ian Begley offers his take on Carmelo Anthony stating his desire to help lure players to the Knicks and whether it will be an effective recruiting tactic. (1:46)

Will Carmelo Anthony's presence help the Knicks in free agency?

It should. Having a star player on hand to push a franchise's selling points can only enhance the pitch.

But the most important guy in the room for the Knicks this summer will be Phil Jackson. It will ultimately be on Jackson to convince an elite free agent to come to New York. And it won't be an easy sell.

Editor's Picks Melo on FA recruiting: Put me at head of table Carmelo Anthony plans to sell free agents on what it's like to play in New York as the Knicks look to improve this summer through $18 million in cap space.

The Knicks probably will miss the playoffs this season, which would mark the third straight year without a playoff game for the franchise. Entering Tuesday's game against the Denver Nuggets, the Knicks are 12 games under .500. That makes them a combined 60 games under .500 since the beginning of the 2014-15 season.

So Jackson will be asking 2016 free agents to take a leap of faith -- and a pay cut -- to join him in New York.

How will the Zen Master make his pitch?

Robin Lopez said his free agent meeting with Phil Jackson was a little ""intimidating."" Steven Freeman/NBAE/Getty Images

If last summer is any indication, Jackson will try to accomplish the following:

1. Get to know the player a bit by discussing some off-court topics

2. Reveal some details about his vision for the Knicks

3. Get into a conversation on the club's triangle offense.

That's how it went for Greg Monroe, DeAndre Jordan and Robin Lopez in July.

""For the longest time, nothing really basketball-related was discussed,"" Lopez said of his 2015 dinner meeting with Jackson and the Knicks in Los Angeles. ""We talked a little bit about culture. He discussed some books he'd been reading, I talked about some movies I'd watched. ... It was nice and it was a little intimidating, because it was Phil Jackson.""

The conversation with Lopez then turned to the triangle offense. Jackson, GM Steve Mills and then-head coach Derek Fisher showed Lopez about 10-15 slides of the offense.

""He knew I had an idea of what to expect because I played against the Lakers when I was in Phoenix,"" Lopez said. ""I think this was just to kind of give me a refresher.""

""Phil was great, it was one of my best meetings. He's such a smart man, such a deep thinker, that you want to be a part of that. He's won, he proven it.... He made it tough to say no."" DeAndre Jordan on Phil Jackson

Jordan received a similar pitch during his meeting with the Knicks.

""They showed me some things, how I'd fit in in that offense and what I would do to excel as a player and what we'd do to excel as a team,"" he said. ""The message [from Jackson] was just for me to be an all-around player and improve my game as much as I could.""

Jordan came away impressed with the presentation.

""Phil was great; it was one of my best meetings,"" he said. ""He's such a smart man, such a deep thinker, that you want to be a part of that. He's won, he proven it. ... He made it tough to say no.""

But he did. So did Monroe and Aldridge and any other big names in the free agent class of 2015.

Jackson landed Lopez, Arron Afflalo, Derrick Williams, Kyle O'Quinn and Kevin Seraphin in free agency last summer. At the time, it was considered a solid but unspectacular haul.

Jackson's biggest addition came in late June, of course, when he selected Kristaps Porzingis with the fourth overall pick of the draft.

The Knicks president will have no such luxury in his second true foray into free agency. The club is sending its first-round pick to Toronto to complete the 2013 Andrea Bargnani trade.

So this summer's free agency is a pivotal one for Jackson.

Carmelo Anthony said he would like to be involved in the Knicks' free agency process and strategy. Joe Robbins/Getty Images

The Knicks will have at least $18 million to spend this offseason on a class that includes Kevin Durant and Al Horford. They will have to spend wisely, because other teams will have more space to use thanks to the rising salary cap.

The big question is whether the Knicks, under Jackson, have a chance at landing one of the elite players on the market.

Along those lines, one name to keep in mind this summer is Dwight Howard.

Some of Howard's friends have let it be known recently that the center would be interested in coming to New York as a free agent if he opts out of his current contract, league sources say.

Whether Jackson and the Knicks would be interested in a player like Howard is another question entirely.

Whomever the Knicks decide to meet with this summer shouldn't expect any theatrics from Jackson.

""He was real laid back,"" Monroe said of Jackson during his Washington, D.C., meeting with the Knicks. ""He was just talking to me as a person, mostly. It was pretty normal. He was just trying to get to know me a little bit. He told me some stuff about him, how he got to this point.""

Jackson arrived at this point, of course, by winning 11 titles as an NBA head coach. If he wants to guide the Knicks in that direction, he'll have to make an impact this summer in free agency.

As nice as it is to have Carmelo Anthony at the table, it will ultimately be up to Jackson to attract some talent to New York.",[]
espn.com,,Marathon heats up with historic U.S. Olympic trials,"['Sue Mott', 'One Naci N', 'Gordon Simpson', 'Pa Sport', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Bonnie D', 'Wayne Drehs', 'Espn Staff', 'Johnette Howard', 'Jim Caple']","LOS ANGELES -- The history between the four women was as thick and palpable as the muggy air that encased the U.S. Olympic marathon trials course Saturday, turning it into a crucible that could forge dreams or overcook them. They had to manage the heat and each other. They had to draw on friendship. They had to forget friendship. They had to survive.

Amy Cragg, Desiree Linden, Shalane Flanagan, Kara Goucher: They know each other so well. Between them, there are thousands of miles, years of shared experiences and the taut, unspoken understanding that marathons often end with a merciless kick. Cragg and Linden were college teammates and roommates at Arizona State University. Flanagan and Goucher trained together to make the 2012 Olympic team. Cragg and Flanagan decided to do the same several months ago.

There were four of them, and three slots for Rio. For most of the race, Cragg and Flanagan ran side by side in their matching gear as if they were on a companionable weekend outing. They broke away from the other top women at the 12-mile mark and left Linden and Goucher to decide whether or not to cover the move. Both women, savvy and self-contained, stuck with their pace and stayed in the game.

Flanagan returned from a foot injury combined with Achilles tendon and back issues just 10 weeks ago. With six miles to go, her form began to tighten while Cragg's remained fluid. Cragg slowed to stay alongside Flanagan and kept exhorting her.

""One mile at a time, just get to the next water station,"" she told her training partner as Flanagan labored, her face flushed with exertion and dehydration in mid-70 degree temperatures. ""There were a couple times where she said, 'I'm not sure I can do this.'""

But with a mile to go, a resolute Linden closing and Goucher clinging tenaciously to the rope end of the race, Cragg realized she had to cut and run. It was a moment with an echo. In 2012, she was the one dangling in the stretch with an Olympic berth at stake. Linden dropped her old pal with three miles to go, and Cragg finished fourth.

Cragg crossed the finish line in 2 hours, 28 minutes, 20 seconds, exulted for a few instants, slung a flag over her shoulders and hugged Linden after her own passage 33 seconds later. Then Cragg wheeled around, walked back toward the course and waited for Flanagan (2:29:19), who took the last few steps by rote and slumped in Cragg's arms. Flanagan's husband, Steve Edwards, quickly scooped her up and carried her to a waiting wheelchair.

History of a different kind defined the men's race -- a long skein of it for 40-year-old Meb Keflezighi, who had finished 22 previous marathons, and a blank slate for 29-year-old track star Galen Rupp, who was running his first.

The contrast between them stood out starkly when they gapped the field, their ball caps bobbing at different heights. At one point, Rupp hugged Keflezighi's heels tightly enough that Keflezighi gestured and demanded more space. Rupp eventually made that moot, accelerating with three miles to go, breezing the rest of the way bareheaded and unchallenged to complete his scintillating debut in 2:11:12.

""It's not a track. The road is open,"" Keflezighi said, smiling, in response to a news conference query about the exchange, alluding to etiquette and his anxiety at the prospect of being clipped from behind. ""It wasn't a very friendly conversation."" A few minutes later, as if on cue, Rupp walked into the room and was escorted to a stool on the dais, inches from Keflezighi. Laughter erupted as Rupp stayed deadpan.

Editor's Picks Goucher: 'Justice will come' in Salazar drug probe Marathon runner Kara Goucher said ""justice will come"" in the ongoing doping investigation of her former coach Alberto Salazar, who has denied any wrongdoing.

Markazi: U.S. Olympic Team Trials Marathon shows off L.A.'s readiness for 2024 bid Los Angeles already has the facilities to host world-class events, and the Olympic Trials Marathon offered yet another chance to confirm the city's readiness for its 2024 Summer Olympics bid.

Olympic marathon trials show women's impact It wasn't so long ago that women weren't allowed to run more than 1,500 meters. More than 40 years later, heading into the 2016 Olympic marathon trials, women are dominating running. 2 Related

""I'm just thrilled with the way the race went,"" Rupp said. He then outlined an ambitious schedule for the next few months. Rupp intends to compete in the world indoor championships in his hometown of Portland, Oregon, in March and confirmed he thinks racing the 10,000 meters in Rio is ""a real possibility,"" assuming he qualifies in the event where he was a silver medalist in 2012.

""I think the 10,000 might still be my better event,"" Rupp said. But, he added, ""I'm going to take some time and enjoy this one."" He appeared unperturbed by a question about the ongoing investigation into last year's doping allegations against him, his coach and his Oregon Project training group, which surfaced again in pointed comments by Goucher, a former member.

Keflezighi (2:12:20) came around the last turn on the course waving and pointing to fans and putting a hand to one ear to provoke more noise from the crowd, then flexed his biceps like Popeye. The Athens 2004 silver medalist and 2014 Boston Marathon champion is the first U.S. runner to make three Olympic marathon teams, and the oldest.

He later choked up while describing all the people in his thoughts on the course, including his friend Ryan Shay, who died during the trials race in 2007. ""We've got to celebrate life, we've got these able bodies,"" Keflezighi said.

Flanagan told NBC that Cragg is ""the epitome of a best friend ... There was a point in the race where I thought I would drop out. Sweet baby Jesus, I'm so thankful for her."" She was then wheeled into the medical tent, helped to her feet by her husband and another man, tucked in prone under a foil blanket and given IV fluids -- a first in her career, she later said. She vowed to work on hydration and heat conditioning before Rio.

Linden was elated to make her second Olympic team after a lengthy comeback that began when injury forced her to drop out of the London 2012 marathon after two miles..

""It was a mental battle when those guys went away, you're wondering if your tactics are right, if they're sound,"" Linden said of Cragg and Flanagan. ""I had to just let them go.

""I was very dialed into what I thought I was capable of on the day, and kind of circled 5:40 [splits] as the magic number. They started clicking off 5:35s and a little bit quicker, even. I felt that was going to be unsustainable over the second half. The heat was gonna be way worse over the last hour of the race and I wanted to be able to finish strong and close well.""

Goucher was alternately composed and emotional after her fourth-place finish, saying she thought she had a real chance to finish in the top three until she hit a wall at Mile 22. She made harsh reference to Salazar, but also made a point of saying how much she admires the three women who qualified for Rio.

""I'm a dreamer,"" Goucher said. ""That's the way I'm wired. I love racing, I love training; I feel alive when I'm preparing for something, it makes me happy. Sometimes it doesn't go the way you hope, but I have such a good life.""

As if to punctuate that, her 5-year-old son, Colt, wandered up, clutching plastic containers meant to hold ants -- ""He's into bugs,"" Goucher explained -- and unconcerned with his mother's placement. She hoisted him into her arms, then went on to another interview. She will try to recover from this kick and now attempt to qualify for the Olympic team on the track.

Sally Bergesen, CEO of Goucher's primary sponsor Oiselle, watched Goucher walk away and observed, ""She makes herself vulnerable and accessible.""

In a nutshell, that is what the marathon tends to do, stripping everyone down on a hot, hot day.",[]

While players on the Kansas City Royals ended their season happily drenched with beverages of a bubbly nature, most MLB players didn't end the season on such a high note. In fact, for some players, 2015 was simply a year to forget. Fortunately for them, the start of the 2016 season is just more than a month away, providing them a natural opportunity to wipe away the memories of the previous season.

Whether you call it a bounce-back season, a comeback year or, as legendary baseball writer Bill James refers to it, the Plexiglass Principle, everybody loves a tale of redemption. After all, when was the last sports movie you saw that involved the heroes going wire-to-wire and coasting to a championship win?

With that, here are my eight picks to have happier 2016 seasons.

Jeff Samardzija, SP

San Francisco Giants

2015 WAR: 0.2

Projected 2016 WAR: 3.0

More 2016 projections: 196 IP, 3.31 ERA, 180 K's

Seeing an opportunity to push themselves to the top of the American League Central in 2015, the White Sox made one of their biggest splashes in years, acquiring Samardzija from the Oakland Athletics to join Chris Sale at the top of a rotation that needed another big-name pitcher. Coming off a 2014 season in which he had a 2.99 ERA, 202 strikeouts and his first All-Star appearance, the White Sox were delighted to acquire one year of a top starter without decimating their farm system.

Instead, the White Sox won only 76 games, and the Shark played a big part in them underachieving; he allowed a career-high (and AL-high) 29 home runs while amassing a 4.96 ERA, easily the worst of his career as a full-time starter.

It's too late for the White Sox to get any benefit from Samardzija outside of the draft-pick compensation they got from him signing elsewhere -- they had given him a qualifying offer -- but the Giants are all-in on him with a five-year, $90 million contract; they're no doubt expecting a bounce-back -- and I agree with them. AT&T Park and its large outfield is a homer-sapping park if you're not named Barry Bonds, and two-thirds of that outfield will be patrolled by Denard Span, who has always been a solid defensive center fielder when healthy, and Angel Pagan, now stretched in center but likely to be much more comfortable in left at this stage in his career.",[]

espn.com,,Alejandro Valverde is considering riding all three grand tours.,"['Andrew Hood', 'Velonews Com', 'Megan Hetzel', 'Doug Williams', ""Runner's World""]","Editor's note: This article originally appeared at VeloNews.com.

Movistar manager Eusebio Unzue said Alejandro Valverde is considering racing all three grand tours this year. According to a report in the Spanish daily MARCA, Valverde could race the Vuelta a Espana after likely starts in both the Giro dItalia and the Tour de France.

Right now, the idea is that Alejandro does not race the Vuelta, Unzue told MARCA at the Vuelta presentation during the weekend. Hes already insinuated it [to race the Vuelta].

Valverde will race the Giro dItalia for the first time in his career this season, and he will likely start the Tour de France as well to prepare for the Rio de Janeiro Olympics. Despite finishing third overall in last year's Tour, Valverde will ride in full support of Nairo Quintana and will use the Tour as a trampoline toward Rio.

I have no doubt that hes capable of doing it, Unzue said of Valverde racing all three grand tours. I think its a question of what we demand, and what he demands of himself, without overdoing it. Hes crazy about his profession ... and, well, hes already insinuated it.

For 2016, Valverde is focusing on one-day classics, and will only race one stage race -- Tirreno-Adriatico -- before the Giro, Unzue confirmed. He will debut at the Mallorca Challenge before racing at Strade Bianche, Tirreno, and Milano-Sanremo.

After getting a taste of the pave last year, he returns to Belgium with a possible start in the Ronde van Vlaanderen (Tour of Flanders) before targeting the Ardennes classics again, where he is the defending champion at La Fleche Wallonne and Liege-Bastogne-Liege.

It just wouldnt be right if Alejandro didnt race the Giro at least once, Unzue continued. As versatile as he is, you can always count on him wherever he goes, and he confirmed that last year reaching the podium at the Tour. We cannot expect more.

So far, only a handful of top riders have committed to racing the Vuelta, including Quintana and Esteban Chaves (Orica-GreenEdge). Three-time winner Alberto Contador (Tinkoff) is leaving the door open to a possible start in whats likely his final season in the pro peloton.",[]
espn.com,,Guillermo Rigondeaux's fight against James Dickens in England off over visa issues,"['Dan Rafael', 'Pa Sport', 'Nick Parkinson', 'Brian Campbell', 'Nigel Collins']","Former unified junior featherweight world champion Guillermo Rigondeaux's fight against James ""Jazza"" Dickens, scheduled for Saturday at Echo Arena in Liverpool, England, is off because of Rigondeaux's problems obtaining a visa.

Rigondeaux had been training in Grozny, Russia, and twice traveled to Moscow with trainer Pedro Diaz to get their visas, but they came away empty-handed each time and flew back to Miami on Tuesday, Roc Nation Sports, Rigondeaux's promoter, told ESPN.com.

Guillermo Rigondeaux's fight in England on Saturday has been called off over visa issues. Chris Farina/Top Rank

The fight was supposed to take place on a card put on by Frank Warren's Queensberry Promotions and headlined by lightweight world titleholder Terry Flanagan's defense against British countryman Derry Mathews.

Rigondeaux, a two-time Cuban Olympic gold medalist who defected and lives in Miami, had traveled to Russia with Diaz, who was there because he was also getting Ruslan Chagaev ready for a secondary title defense against Lucas Browne this past Saturday.

On Feb. 29, according to Roc Nation Sports, Rigondeaux and Diaz flew from Grozny to Moscow to go to the British consulate in attempt to get their visas, which were being processed but not finalized.

Rigondeaux and Diaz then returned to Grozny, where Rigondeaux continued to train. On Sunday, the day after Browne knocked out Chagaev in the 10th round, Rigondeaux and Diaz returned to Moscow to again try to get the visas. They waited for a few hours and then for unexplained reasons left and eventually flew back to Miami.

Warren said that he took care of responsibilities on his end and that he continued to work closely with Dino Duva of Roc Nation Sports in an effort to get the visa squared away.

Warren said Roc Nation Sports was ""made aware very early in the negotiation process"" that Rigondeaux would need an entry visa to travel to England but would not need a work permit ""due to his international sporting status and this being a singular international event.""

""Accordingly, QP issued the necessary supporting documentation for his application and accordingly, the visa was correctly applied for by Team Rigondeaux,"" Warren said. ""We were told that it could take five clear working days for the visa to be issued so Rigondeaux could travel, but the problem was, or so we were told, that due to a public holiday in Russia on (Tuesday) the application center would be closed and he may not be able to collect his visa until Wednesday.""

Warren and Roc Nation Sports said that they did no know why Rigondeaux flew to Miami on Tuesday.

""We have yet to establish how and why he flew to the USA and further, how he managed to fly anywhere when the normal practice is, when applying for a visa, that you hand your passport in and get it back when the visa is issued,"" Warren said. ""Strangely, Rigondeaux left Moscow at a time when both the (visa) application centre and consulate were still closed. He has yet to explain to RNS, who are as much in the dark as QP, as to how and why he has arrived in the USA and why he was in possession of his passport which should, as is standard protocol, have been presented to the visa application center.

""We are all extremely disappointed by the whole situation as Rigondeaux will not appear this Saturday and Dickens will not get the chance, that he has trained so hard for, to fight the world's best (junior featherweight) in front of his own fans.""

Rigondeaux (16-0, 10 KOs), a 35-year-old southpaw, was stripped of his two 122-pound world titles late last year because of inactivity. Unwanted by American television networks because of his extremely technical style, he was headed to England to fight Dickens (21-1, 6 KOs), 24, in Dickens' hometown while also attempting to drum up interest in a possible bout with titleholder Carl Frampton, of Northern Ireland, who outpointed England's Scott Quigg to unify belts on Feb.27.",[]
espn.com,,Tony Thompson not afraid of tough heavyweight Luis Ortiz,"['Dan Rafael', 'Pa Sport', 'Brian Campbell', 'Nigel Collins']","Heavyweight Luis Ortiz has quickly earned a reputation as a take-no-prisoners destroyer, the kind of fast and powerful big man few want to tangle with, especially because he is not yet in position to bring riches to the table to make his potential wrath worth the risk for the top dogs in the division.

Golden Boy Promotions CEO Oscar De La Hoya, Ortiz's promoter, echoes much of the public and media sentiment when he calls him ""the most feared man on the planet in the heavyweight division.""

Luis Ortiz-Tony Thompson Where: D.C. Armory in Washington, D.C.

When: Saturday, 10 p.m. ET/PT

TV: HBO

""Let me tell you one thing,"" De La Hoya said. ""When I tell you that nobody wants to fight him, nobody wants to step up to the plate and fight him. I'm putting everybody on notice in the heavyweight division: Luis Ortiz is coming after you.

""This man is out on a mission. He's out to prove to the world that he's afraid of no one.""

Although a failed steroid test in 2014 is a mark against him, Ortiz served a suspension, paid a fine and has been flawless in three fights since, including a vicious third-round knockout of low-level opponent Matias Ariel Vidondo in October to win a vacant interim world title.

But it was the fight that came next, a dominant seventh-round knockout of top contender Bryant Jennings on Dec. 19, that really caused a stir.

Finding an opponent to face ""The Real King Kong"" next was an arduous task. Several turned down the fight, some even before money was discussed. Russian contender Alexander Dimitrenko agreed to the fight but then refused to sign the contract and pulled out.

""I didn't take this fight in my hometown to get embarrassed. I don't believe in the boogeyman. D.C. raised a man. I'm all man. I don't care who the opponent is. I'll meet you in the middle of the ring, and let's see what happens."" Tony Thompson

""I get a little bit frustrated with there not being so many opponents out there that are able to take the fight,"" Ortiz said through a translator.

Enter Tony Thompson, the veteran former two-time world title challenger who has pulled off an upset or two in his time. With Golden Boy's card already set to take place in Thompson's hometown of Washington, D.C., he jumped at the opportunity to face Ortiz when it was offered in early February even though Ortiz's interim belt will not be at stake.

Belt or no belt, Ortiz wants another impressive performance when he faces Thompson on Saturday night (HBO, 10 ET/PT) in the ""Boxing After Dark"" main event at the DC Armory to continue to make his case that he is a big man to be reckoned with.

""I'm an athlete. I do my job. I come to box,"" Ortiz said. ""The ones that don't want to fight I don't understand because this is boxing. I don't understand why would they avoid me. There's no reason to avoid another man, so I admire [Thompson] for taking the fight. Nobody else wanted to take it. And he's going to come and do his job.""

In the co-feature, welterweight contenders Sadam Ali (22-0, 13 KOs), 27, of New York City, and former junior welterweight titlist Jessie Vargas (26-1, 9 KOs), 26, of Las Vegas, will fight for a vacant welterweight world title, the one Timothy Bradley Jr. recently vacated after agreeing to fight Manny Pacquiao for the third time on April 9.

Luis Ortiz, right, defeated Bryant Jennings easily to defend his interim heavyweight title in December. Ed Diller for ESPN

It's no wonder few want to tangle with Miami-based Cuban defector Ortiz (24-0, 21 KOs). A former standout on the storied Cuban national team, Ortiz is a 6-foot-4, 235-pound southpaw with fast hands, fast feet and crushing power.

So confident in Ortiz's ability is De La Hoya that if Ortiz defeats Thompson and comes through the fight with no injuries, he is penciled in for a quick turnaround on the Canelo Alvarez-Amir Khan HBO PPV undercard on May 7 in Las Vegas.

Ortiz said he wants to stay active and get to one of the top titleholders as soon as possible. His interim belt puts him on a path to soon become a mandatory challenger for the winner of the upcoming rematch between champion Tyson Fury and former champion Wladimir Klitschko.

""I want to fight whoever has the belt,"" Ortiz said. ""Tyson Fury, Wladimir Klitschko, whoever has the belt is who I would like to fight.""

Thompson (40-6, 27 KOs), a 6-5 southpaw who is 4-4 in his past eight bouts and coming off a decision loss to Malik Scott in October, knows he is the big underdog, although his four wins in the stretch were impressive. He scored back-to-back upset knockouts of England's David Price and two more wins (a decision and a knockout) against Cuban defector and Olympic gold medalist Odlanier Solis.

""I don't understand why would they avoid me. There's no reason to avoid another man, so I admire [Thompson] for taking the fight. Nobody else wanted to take it. And he's going to come and do his job."" Luis Ortiz

Thompson admitted that, when he was offered the fight with Ortiz about five weeks ago, he had not been in the gym training, but the 44-year-old is the rare breed of boxer who not only has traveled the world for fights but rarely has turned one down. So, when the chance to fight at home -- and on HBO, no less -- came up, he wasn't about to say no.

""I appreciate the opportunity,"" Thompson said. ""I'm not the youngest guy in the sport, but I'm probably still the hungriest guy in the sport. I don't know how I'm going to be facing the most feared fighter, the most feared and tough fighter in the division, because that's myself. So I can't box myself. But I understand what you're saying about your guy. It's all good, baby. He won't have no problem finding me, trust me.

""My whole career has been a span of short-notice fights. This is nothing new to us. And before y'all ask me, no, I wasn't in the gym. It don't matter because I'm working my ass off. Short-notice fights have made my career because everybody thinks they're going to catch me off guard, catch me slipping. All they can do is make me extra motivated. So, when I go in the gym and I bust my ass two or three times a day getting ready, that's what I try to think about: They're trying to pull the fast one on me again. It's up to me to show them it's not the case.""

Seven of Thompson's previous eight fights have been outside the United States, and he has not fought in his home region since a 2006 bout in Maryland.

""I didn't take this fight in my hometown to get embarrassed,"" Thompson said. ""I don't believe in the boogeyman. D.C. raised a man. I'm all man. I don't care who the opponent is. I'll meet you in the middle of the ring, and let's see what happens. He's the kind of fighter who is going to bring out the best in me.""

De La Hoya said he respected Thompson for his willingness to fight Ortiz, especially on somewhat short notice.

""I would like to take this opportunity to commend Tony Thompson and his team,"" he said. ""Here you have a fighter who is experienced, who is ready to prove that he's afraid of no one.""

Ortiz is not much of a talker, especially compared to Thompson, one of the most loquacious in the sport.

""Unlike Mr. Thompson, who uses humor and good words and is very well spoken, I instill fear through my hard work,"" Ortiz said. ""In the ring is where I'm most comfortable, and that's where I'll continue to prove why I am the most feared heavyweight on the planet.

""Tony said that he is Godzilla. I didn't see the movie, but, on Saturday night, 'King Kong' is going to beat Godzilla.""",[]

The Giants are the only team to open with a win total of 90. They are followed closely by the Cubs at 89 and the New York Mets at 88.

""To me, the Giants, top-to-bottom, have the least amount of question marks,"" Atlantis sportsbook director Steve Mikkelson said. ""The Cubs are a very good, but they have these youngsters. What if Kris Bryant goes into a slump? They have a lot swing-and-miss guess.""

The St. Louis Cardinals, Washington Nationals, Pittsburgh Pirates and Los Angeles Dodgers also have win totals of 87 or greater.

In the American League, the Kansas City Royals are tops. The defending World Series champs opened at 87 wins (-115 under).

""In the American League, to me, every team, except for the [Oakland] A's, think they can win it,"" Mikkelson said. ""Unlike the National League, where there are eight teams really fighting for the five spots, in the American League, there are 14 teams fighting for the five slots.""

The rebuilding Atlanta Braves have the lowest win-total expectations at 65. The Philadelphia Phillies and Colorado Rockies are the only others with win totals in the 60s.

The Atlantis Casino posted the totals Thursday afternoon. Limits are $500. It's the 10th straight year Mikkelson has been first in posting season win totals on the market. He said the hardest team to set this year was his favorite team, the Boston Red Sox. He went with 85.5.

""It's a very busy week; there's a lot of stuff going on,"" said his grandson Sam Saunders, who is also a PGA Tour member. ""It's tiring for me and I'm 28 years old. At 86, he's doing OK, but I think his availability to get out and be on the course and be seen as much will be limited. But I know he'll still have a huge role.""

For years, Palmer has hosted a Wednesday pre-tournament news conference with the assembled media at Bay Hill, site of his Arnold Palmer Invitational. That won't happen next week, replaced instead by a private question-and-answer session that won't be in front of any cameras.

He will, though, still be on site throughout the tournament.

""I know he's still going to be around; he's still going to be out there,"" Saunders said. ""I know all the guys want to see him and he'll want to see all the guys, so hopefully he'll be feeling good and will be able to come out and play a pretty big role.

""But whether he's able to be there in person for some of these moments or not, it doesn't matter. He's still the focus. We all know what he's done and who he is. Whether he can physically be there or not, he's still always going to be there.""

As for his grandfather's health, Saunders maintained that just being around the tournament again should help matters.

""He's doing OK. I don't think his liveliness is quite there like it has been, but I think that's pretty common for the age. As he says, getting old is tough. I've seen it in him; I've seen it in my other grandfather. Aging is tough and over the past couple of years, everything is exacerbated a little bit. But he's tough.

""The one thing that will never go away is his toughness. He's not just going to lay down and not do anything. He'll be active and he'll still be out there trying to push it. I wouldn't expect anything less from him.

""All the guys coming to the tournament and seeing the familiar faces will definitely get his spirits up. He'll be excited to see everyone.""

Saunders also explained that, just as he's done for years, his grandfather will be on the range with him at some point during the week, analyzing his swing and offering some pointers.

""It's amazing what he can still see and do,"" he said. ""Every now and then, the words of wisdom that come out are mind-boggling. It doesn't seem like he can still have that much knowledge. There are very few people in golf who know the game, physically or mentally, better than him.""

As for Palmer's role at another upcoming tournament, that is still to be decided.

Since 2007, he has served as an honorary starter at the Masters Tournament, joined by fellow Big Three legends Jack Nicklaus in 2010 and Gary Player two years later.

""I know he's planning on going,"" Saunders said of Palmer's Masters plan. ""Whether he hits a tee shot, I don't know. But I think just having him standing there would be good. Being part of that is so special to him. Those are the things that if he's having a bad day and he gets to do something like that, it certainly gets his spirits going and he feels better. I think it has a huge influence on the way he feels and the way he interacts. I hope he's at Augusta and I sure think he will be.""",[]

The newspaper reported that the company sent letters to the DFS operators referencing the opinion of the attorneys general in several states who contend that daily fantasy games under their state laws are illegal.

Although daily fantasy companies have been fighting in court in those states, which include New York, Texas and Illinois, the letter written by a Vantiv executive -- and obtained by the Times -- noted that ""to date those arguments have been unsuccessful and/or rejected."" The executive, Jonathan Ellman, who is chief transaction and marketing counsel for the company, said in the letter that Vantiv would consider re-entering the marketplace when legal hurdles have been cleared.

It's unknown what percentage of daily fantasy business Vantiv affects, but it is considered a major player.

Vantiv did not return messages left for comment.

The Times said that Vantiv's decision included the biggest daily fantasy companies, DraftKings and FanDuel, but that was called into question when DraftKings outside counsel David Boies said in a statement Friday afternoon that the company ""has not told DraftKings that it plans to cease fulfilling its contractual obligations.""

Boies also stated that Vantiv is under court order, per the temporary restraining order in Massachusetts, ""to continue to fulfill its contractual obligation to DraftKings.""

A FanDuel representative said the company would have no comment.

""Its departure will be a blow to DFS operators, large and small,"" said Indiana University professor Sarah Jane Hughes, who is an expert on payment processing.

Hughes said payment processors face penalties under the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 if they participate with people or companies that states have deemed as participating in illegal gambling. But because the matter has been tied up in the courts, it's unclear why Vantiv might have made a sudden change or whether they're even legally allowed to.

Vantiv's investors evidently appreciated the news that the company might be leaving the daily fantasy business. Over the past month, the stock was down 6.7 percent. On Friday alone, shares rose 6 percent.

PayPal Holdings Inc. also processes payments for daily sports companies.

""We are aware of Vantiv's recent decision to discontinue processing payments for Daily Fantasy Sports services,"" PayPal spokeswoman Martha Cass said in a statement. ""We continue to review and consider ongoing developments in relation to daily fantsy sports.""

espn.com,,More at stake in Braehmer-Gutknecht light heavyweight rematch,['Dan Rafael'],"In February 2013, Juergen Braehmer won a unanimous decision and the European light heavyweight title from Eduard Gutknecht.

They meet in a rematch -- this time for much bigger stakes -- on Saturday at the Jahnsportforum in Neubrandenburg, Germany.

Braehmer will be making the sixth defense of his secondary 175-pound world title when he faces Gutknecht again after outpointing him on scores of 117-110, 116-111 and 114-113 the first time around. Braehmer, (47-2, 35 KOs), a 37-year-old southpaw from Germany, is confident he will triumph again.

There was a lot of uncertainty before our first fight, Braehmer said. I was returning after almost a year out of the ring and I didnt know how much I still had in the tank. A lot of people wanted to write me off and there was a lot of pressure on me to perform. But that night I proved my potential, and not only did the win lead me to a shot at the world title, it also allowed me to prove, to myself and to the fans, that I still had a lot to give.

This time I will be going into the ring full of confidence. I know what Im capable of and I believe Im a better fighter now than I was three years ago, but Im not sure the same can be said of Gutknecht. Hes a good fighter and he deserves his shot, but Im the world champion and no one is going to take my title from me.

Gutknecht is getting the shot at Braehmer because original opponent, South Africas Thomas Oosthuizen (25-0-2, 14 KOs), pulled out last month because, according to Rodney Berman, his promoter, he is dealing with a drinking problem that left him unable to train.

Gutknecht (29-3-1, 12 KOs), 33, a native of Kazakhstan living in Germany, is excited about the opportunity to avenge the defeat and claim a title.

I know I didnt lose out first fight, he said. Juergen Braehmer didnt beat me. The belt was taken from me by the judges. But this time I will leave the decision in no doubt. This opportunity has come at the perfect time for me and I couldnt be more motivated.

I dont believe Braehmer has improved since our last fight. Hes 37 years old so I cant see how this is possible. Of course, hes a good fighter but hes on the decline and his stamina is gone. I think if Juergen and his coach look at my best performances and compare it to his recent fights even they must know the truth.

Im at the stage of my career where there can be no more excuses. I have nothing to lose and everything to gain. I know I have what it takes to win this fight, and on Saturday, I will prove that Braehmers time is over and I will be crowned world champion.",[]

ESPN Cowboys reporter Todd Archer discusses whether Dallas would or should target Ohio State running back Ezekiel Elliott in the first round. (2:05)

Now that the NFL combine is behind us, let's take a look at the players who have moved up and down our Top 32, while drawing on the same scouting reports and making changes only where necessary. We're also incorporating charts for each player, which feature the two most important measurables for that player's position (when available). Each chart includes outstanding, average and red-flag benchmarks based on historical data.

Editor's Picks McShay: 2016 NFL Mock Draft 3.0 Which player will your team select in Round 1? Todd McShay projects the picks in the 2016 NFL draft, with CB Jalen Ramsey and OT Laremy Tunsil cracking the top five.

We'll continue to update our board as we get closer to the 2016 NFL draft. Although it's a given that some players will move into the rankings while others drop out, this provides a good snapshot of which players currently have the most NFL potential, based on our evaluations. For our full rankings list, check out this link.

(Underclassmen are noted with an asterisk.)

1. Joey Bosa, DE, Ohio State*

The gap between Bosa and the other top-tier players in this draft is narrowing, but the Ohio State star remains No. 1 on my board. While Bosa does not have elite speed off the edge, as evidenced by his combine 40 time (see chart below), he shows the relentlessness and instincts shared by most top-level NFL pass-rushers. Bosa keeps offensive linemen off-balance with a wide array of pass-rush moves. Playing with outstanding effort, he finished his Buckeyes career with 50.5 tackles for loss in 41 games.

2. Laremy Tunsil, OT, Mississippi*

An exceptional athlete, Tunsil is firmly in the mix for the No. 1 overall pick because of his ability to redirect and mirror top pass-rushers. He's not a road grader in the run game, but he shows great range in that area and would fit best in a zone-blocking scheme due to his exceptional mobility. Tunsil opted against running the 40-yard dash and doing the bench press at the combine, but I'm looking forward to seeing if the results match the tape when he works out at Ole Miss' pro day later this month.

3. DeForest Buckner, DE, Oregon

Buckner isn't going to win many battles with speed, but he has good length and explosive upper-body power to push the pocket as a pass-rusher. Buckner, who's best suited to play 5-technique in a 3-4, also has the quickness and agility to play left defensive end in a 4-3. He posted 17.0 TFLs (including 10.5 sacks) in 2015, showing the versatility and motor befitting a top-five pick.",[]
espn.com,,Luis Ortiz stops Tony Thompson in sixth round,"['Dan Rafael', 'Pa Sport', 'Brian Campbell', 'Nigel Collins']","WASHINGTON -- Heavyweight Luis Ortiz is one of the most feared punchers in the division, and he showed why yet again.

""The Real King Kong"" once again displayed crushing power in his left hand to devastating effect, knocking Tony Thompson down with it three times en route to an utterly one-sided sixth-round knockout victory before 4,585 on Saturday night at the DC Armory.

The 6-foot-4, 242-pound Miami-based Ortiz, a Cuban defector, looked tremendous when he drilled contender Bryant Jennings in sensational fashion in a seventh-round TKO on Dec. 19 to retain his interim belt for the first time. He looked equally as dangerous against Thompson, although the belt was not at stake. Regardless, few top heavyweights are anxious to fight Ortiz.

""You still haven't seen the best of me; you have not seen the best of 'King Kong,'"" Ortiz said through a translator. ""I am ready for anyone in the ring any time.""

Asked about the fact that he is 36 and not looking to stretch out his road to the top, Ortiz (25-0, 22 KOs) said his age makes no difference.

""It doesn't matter. Age doesn't matter. Look what Bernard Hopkins did,"" Ortiz said, pointing to the future Hall of Famer and HBO commentator, who is 51 and still fighting at a high level. ""I have the qualities. Whoever wants it. Doesn't matter. I have quality.""

Ortiz, a southpaw, took command immediately, landing a chopping left hand to Thompson's head to drop him in the first round. Thompson barely beat the count. He took some hard shots through the rest of the round, including a body shot that bounced him into the ropes.

Thompson, a longtime contender who has seen better days, was smiling at Ortiz, but it did not look like a laughing matter as Ortiz sized him up and fired accurate punches while Thompson barely landed anything.

Ortiz knocked the 6-5, 264-pound Thompson down for the second time when he landed virtually the exact same overhand left to his head as the bell sounded to end the third round. Thompson, who got knocked out by Wladimir Klitschko twice in world title fights, beat the count but walked to his corner with a look of resignation on his face.

In the sixth round, Ortiz cranked up the overhand left again and slammed it into Thompson's head as he went down for the third time, coming to rest with his head against the bottom ring rope. He made an effort to get to his feet, but referee Malik Waleed counted him out at 2 minutes, 29 seconds, sending Ortiz climbing up the ring post, where he beat his chest like King Kong does in the films.

According to CompuBox punch statistics, Ortiz landed 88 of 250 punches (35 percent) while Thompson connected on 43 of 221 punches (19 percent).

Thompson, who has loads of experience against top fighters, was impressed by Ortiz.

""He is strong as advertised,"" Thompson said. ""It's sad that my hometown got to see me at the end of my career versus at the peak of my career. I just think it would have been a much better fight with prime Tony Thompson that's all, but the guy is as strong as a monster. But, again, three weeks of training and that's the best I have for three weeks.""

Ortiz said that he was not concerned that Thompson hung around as long as he did despite Ortiz's dominance, although one judge stunningly gave Thompson two rounds.

""He's a fighter who has lots of experience,"" Ortiz said. ""My professor [trainer Herman Caicedo] also told me not to worry, that everything would come in time. I boxed a little, I punched a little bit. 'King Kong' is here and knows how to get the job done.""

Thompson (40-7, 27 KOs), a 44-year-old southpaw, looked every bit his age. A pro for 17 years and fighting in his hometown for the first time, he showed very little.

He was slow -- he has a bad knee -- and did not look to be in top condition, which came as no surprise considering he took the fight on about three weeks' notice because so many others had turned down the fight, and then Russian Alexander Dimitrenko backed out after agreeing.

For Ortiz, it was a way to stay busy and keep showing the public that he is a big man to be reckoned with.

""The ring is full of blood and it's not my blood,"" Ortiz said.

Ortiz has a mandatory defense of his interim belt due by June 19 against Russian Alexander Ustinov (33-1, 24 KOs), and Golden Boy Promotions vice president Eric Gomez said they will attempt to make a deal with Ustinov promoter Frank Warren to place the fight on the Canelo Alvarez-Amir Khan HBO PPV undercard on May 7 in Las Vegas.

""You still haven't seen the best of me, you have not seen the best of 'King Kong.' I am ready for anyone in the ring any time."" Luis Ortiz

""We'll talk and see if we can get it done,"" Gomez said. ""We'll talk to Frank Warren, and if he's reasonable we'll get the fight done.""

But getting Ustinov or any other fighter in the ring with Ortiz is going to be difficult, which Ortiz and his team know. Ortiz was confident, though, that he would get a big fight eventually.

""They're going to have to fight me,"" he said. ""I have [Golden Boy CEO] Oscar De La Hoya, Golden Boy, HBO and the WBA behind me. They'll make it happen. I am grateful to them.

""I'm back in the gym on Monday. This is my job. It's what I do.""

Gomez, like some, believes Ortiz is the best heavyweight in the world.

""He's the most exciting. He has the speed, the power, the charisma,"" Gomez said. ""With the help of HBO we're going to continue to pound him and pound him and pound him until somebody opens the door. We want the best fights. We will work with any promoter. He wants the best fights. He deserves it.""",[]
espn.com,,"Royals bullpen is royalty, but how far behind are Chicago Cubs?","['Ryan Williams', 'David Schoenfield', 'Jesse Rogers', 'As Told To Jesse Rogers']","MESA, Ariz. -- There may be no better compliment paid to the back end of a bullpen than when its said: ""The game is over after six innings."" The world champion Kansas City Royals' bullpen has been described that way. The upstart Chicago Cubs' bullpen is trying to establish the same kind of identity. Theyre not quite there, but they believe they are an underrated group.

The numbers arent that much different, but I feel like their guys have been consistent for so long, reliever Justin Grimm said Monday before the Cubs played the Royals in a spring game. Were starting to show that. We should get some publicity for that, but I try not to compare -- its about showing up to be there for your team.

The Royals' bullpen ranked second in baseball with a 2.72 ERA in 2015, while the Cubs' bullpen was eighth at 3.38. The Royals were first in batting average against, while the Cubs ranked sixth. Most statistics are similar, but a closer look at moments late in games reveals that the Cubs were, in fact, every bit as good as the Royals.

Though its a much harder comparison to make across leagues, in innings 7-9 both bullpens had the same WHIP (1.16), and Chicago had more strikeouts per nine innings (8.89 to 8.51), fewer walks (2.74 to 3.05) and fewer home runs (0.73 to 0.87). Kansas City had the better overall ERA (3.32 to 3.01) and both teams blew about the same number of saves (20 to 19), but the Cubs arent known for their bullpen, while the Royals have several household names.

They just exemplify it better than anyone else, manager Joe Maddon said. Theyve demonstrated it over the last couple of years.

Despite his tendency to mix roles, Maddon isnt against having three guys -- like the Royals Kelvin Herrera, Wade Davis and Greg Holland -- for innings 7-9. But until hes confident he has those arms, Maddon will continue to rotate pitchers in and out based on the best matchup, though Hector Rondon is clearly his closer.

Theyve had this luxury of having relief pitchers in the latter part of the game that didnt know lefties from righties, Maddon said of the Royals. Theyve got neutral, dominant pitchers.

Maddon went on to name his neutral pitchers, including Grimm, Trevor Cahill, Clayton Richard and Adam Warren. But none are necessarily in the same class as the Royals' trio.

When the Royals' bullpen comes in, the game is over, Rondon said. I think we can be like that.

How far off are the Cubs? Actually, the offense may have a say about that.

Theres a lot of versatility among the group and you can rest guys, Maddon said. The big thing would be not to abuse or overuse them, especially early.

So what if the Cubs arent playing as many close games because their offense is clicking? Thats when Maddon can rest his top relievers. Last season, the offense couldnt be counted on for six months and the team played in the third-most one-run games in baseball, so guys such as Strop and Rondon were used more often than Maddon would have liked. This time around -- at least in theory -- the Cubs might be able to rest their top guys more.

Were not better than them, but were close, Rondon said of the Royals.

Maybe they are and no one quite knows it.",[]

espn.com,,"Year removed from comeback, Mets' Matt Harvey has low-key spring debut",['Adam Rubin'],"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- It lacked the drama of his opening Grapefruit League start a year ago, when Matt Harvey first was returning from Tommy John surgery and felt compelled to fire fastballs at 99 mph. Still, the Dark Knight had a positive 2016 exhibition debut for the New York Mets on Tuesday at ESPN Wide World of Sports.

Harvey required only seven pitches to retire the first four Atlanta Braves batters he faced, faced bases-loaded situations in his final two frames and ultimately allowed one run on three hits and two walks in three innings. He primarily sat at 96 mph with his fastball during the 41-pitch outing and struck out one batter.

The lone run to score against Harvey came on a third-inning sacrifice fly by Nick Markakis after Ender Inciarte and Erick Aybar singles and a walk to Freddie Freeman loaded the bases.

Last year, obviously, there was a lot of unknown -- where things are going to be regarding the surgery, Harvey said. I think this year its nice not hearing, How is your arm feeling? Are you healthy? all the time. ... I think were all kind of in the same boat now, except for Zack [Wheeler] obviously, where nobody is really coming off of an injury or a missed year. Weve all had our experience.

Matt Harvey says he hasn't had any issues with his elbow since undergoing Tommy John surgery in 2013. Matt Harvey

Harvey escaped a serious threat in the second inning, although he never was hit hard during the frame. With one out, Adonis Garcia sent a comebacker that glanced off Harveys glove for an infield single. Third baseman Wilmer Flores then was charged with an error throwing to second base trying to initiate a would-be double play. After Nick Swisher worked a walk to cap a seven-pitch plate appearance and load the bases, Harvey then produced a 95 mph fastball, which initiated an inning-ending 4-6-3 double play. Herrera smothered the grounder off the bat of Daniel Castro on the backhand and shoveled it with his glove to Ruben Tejada at shortstop to begin the twin killing.

Thats what spring is about, Harvey said. You have to amp things up and get into those situations. Youre never really going to learn from anything if you go 1-2-3 with seven or eight pitches throughout the whole thing. Obviously its spring training. Getting into those situations where youre adrenaline starts pumping up a little bit, its good practice.

Harvey said he is getting more extension -- or follow-through -- this spring training at the end of his delivery compared with last season. He also senses progress with his slider, which he threw quite a bit Tuesday.

I think the spin and the swings and misses that Ive gotten between here and live batting practice have definitely showed thats where it needs to be, Harvey said. It wasnt that case for three-quarters of the year last year, so its nice to have that back.

Harveys first spring training start a year ago was flawless. He retired all six Detroit Tigers he faced while ramping up his fastball to 99 mph. On Tuesday against the Braves, Harvey topped out at 97 mph. His locker in the visitors clubhouse was crowded with reporters after the outing, but Harvey for the most part has enjoyed a low-key spring training now that the Tommy John surgery is in the rearview mirror.

As you get older and you get into more spring trainings, I think you realize how long it is until the season actually starts, and also how long into the season that we want to go, Harvey said. Obviously, last year I was pretty excited to get back in there and let it all out. But as far as this spring training, I definitely think we all realize theres still a lot of time to go and work to be done in order to get where we need to be.

Harvey did lament the pair of walks he issued.

That comes with not facing hitters, and get into situations that you havent been put in in a while, Harvey said. Eliminating damage, I think I did a good job of today. But as far as possibly getting into more damage, thats something we need to work on.

Meanwhile, Harvey insisted he really has not thought about his elbow since before he underwent Tommy John surgery on Oct. 22, 2013.

I never had an issue with it, Harvey said. I never had soreness. I never had anything like that. So, for me, it never really was an issue.",[]
espn.com,,"Brock Osweiler, Houston Texans agree to terms","['Espn Stats', 'Mark Simon', 'Jessie Kavana', 'Ken Woolums', 'Bryan Beasley', 'Sharon Katz', 'John Mctigue', 'Paul Sabin']","Four players started games at quarterback for the Houston Texans last season. And with the reports that they have agreed to a contract with Brock Osweiler, it appears someone new entirely will be No. 1 in Week 1 of 2016.

Osweiler started seven games in a row for the Denver Broncos toward the end of the 2015 season but finished as Peyton Mannings backup. For the Texans, handing the offense to a backup continues a trend.

ESPN Stats & Information

As the graphic above shows, the Texans have made a habit of relying on unproven players as their starting quarterback. And in some cases it has worked out.

In 2007, the Texans traded for Atlanta Falcons backup Matt Schaub, who ended up becoming the franchise leader in most major passing categories. Schaub had a Total QBR of at least 55 for the six seasons from 2007 to 2012. (The league average for Total QBR is 50.)

Their experience with Ryan Mallett was less successful. He started two games in 2014 before being injured and was named the starting quarterback beginning in Week 2 of 2015. The team was 1-3 in the four games he started, and he had a Total QBR of 48. After incidents that included him missing a team flight, the team released Mallett in late October.

From the 2012 to 2015 seasons, the Texans ranked 23rd out of the 32 NFL teams in Total QBR. They haven't had a quarterback start 16 games in a season since Schaub in 2012.

Osweilers deal reportedly will be for four years with an average annual value of $72 million. That average would be the same as the average the Cowboys Tony Romo has on his current deal.

Last season was the first of Osweilers four in the NFL in which he threw more than 11 passes. He led the Broncos to a 5-2 record but posted a 49 Total QBR.

Effect on Broncos

The Broncos in 2016 will become the sixth reigning Super Bowl champion to begin the next season with a different starting quarterback than who won the Lombardi Trophy the previous season, Elias Sports Bureau research shows.

The last team to do so was the Pittsburgh Steelers, who won Super Bowl XL in the 2005 season but began 2006 with Charlie Batch after Ben Roethlisberger had an emergency appendectomy.

Elvis Grbac, who took over with the Baltimore Ravens in 2001 after they won Super Bowl XXXV with Trent Dilfer, is the only quarterback among these who was not on the Super Bowl teams roster the previous season. He was cut from the Kansas City Chiefs on March 1, 2001, and signed a five-year contract with the Ravens five days later. Grbac lasted with the Ravens for only the 2001 season and never played another down in the NFL.

Osweilers departure means Trevor Siemian is the only quarterback on the Broncos roster.

The Broncos and the Texans will play in the 2016 regular season (the date isnt known yet.)

Did you know?

In the second halves of games last season, Osweiler had a Total QBR of 26 -- worst among qualifying quarterbacks. Texans quarterbacks, on the other hand, had a Total QBR of 74 in the second halves of games last season, second-best in the league.",[]
espn.com,,"Dota 2 requires strategy, skill and luck","['James Obscurica', 'James Bates', 'Wynton Prog', 'Obscurica Chen', 'Stephen Chiu', 'Dan Szymborski', 'Joe Bartel', 'Erzberger James', 'Tomi Lurppis', 'Timothy Lee']","It's no secret that esports as a whole has seen a meteoric rise in interest as of late, with games such as League of Legends, Hearthstone and Dota 2 all becoming mainstream. League of Legends is the most popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) and the most popular esport in the world, for that matter, but Dota 2 boasts by far most prize money and has unique qualities that separate itself from other MOBAs.

To the casual observer, Dota 2 and League of Legends could seem like fraternal twins. Both games focus on two groups of five players facing off against one another in an attempt to destroy a central location, such as the Ancient in Dota 2 and the Nexus in LoL. Both games allow for each character to use a variety of spells or ultimate abilities to affect the outcome and strategy of the game, like a bizarre chess match. And each game requires the help of creeps, who mindlessly shuffle down specified lanes to destroy enemy objectives and are controlled by the computer.

But if you look closely, there are a couple of major differences between Dota 2 and League of Legends, ones that drastically alter the strategy of the game. The first, and arguably most important difference, focuses on those aforementioned creeps and the ability to ""deny"" a kill.

Much of the early portion of the game, otherwise known as the ""laning"" phase, is centered on gaining experience and gold. The easiest way to accumulate that wealth and experience is by killing the opposition's creeps. Considering players have the opportunity to accumulate additional gold by landing the final hit on an enemy creep (called last hitting) the timing behind each move becomes increasingly critical. However, Dota 2 provides players the option to deny a kill, attacking their own creep in an effort to reject the opposition's attempt to gain additional gold and experience. While the move might seem barbaric, the strategic elements behind the friendly fire causality cannot be overstated, and it's one of the ways Dota 2 separates itself from League of Legends.

Another critical difference between the two games focuses on player deaths. Let's face it, even the best LoL or Dota 2 players will succumb to a death every so often. While LoL tends not to penalize death, other than forcing the player to miss out on potential gold gains while they wait for their hero to respawn, Dota 2 puts a premium on life. So much so that when a player dies, they lose a certain chunk of their acquired gold. Thus killing an opponent's hero in Dota 2 becomes a twofold attack: A player pockets a hefty amount of change by disposing an enemy player while simultaneously ruining their opposition's chance at building up any sort of gold reserves, money which could be used to purchase items that boost the character's attributes.

While there are other smaller differences between the two MOBA games, the two highlighted above stand out as particularly important when looking at the finer points of Dota 2. Generally speaking, you, as a fan, can predict the outcome of the game depending on which team does a better job of using those unique aspects to their advantage.

There are plenty of opportunities to watch the professionals put together intricate schemes and strategies throughout the year. Dominant organizations like Team Secret and Evil Geniuses display this in spades, and it's part of the reason they are some of the best teams in the world, and likely will continue to be for the foreseeable future.

Fighting with Team Secret for the right to be named best team in Europe, Team Liquid and the ever-impressive OG will also look to flex their respective gaming prowess. And with the introduction of four annual, seasonal tournaments, dubbed the Dota Major Championship, or majors for short, fans of the game will have more opportunities to watch their favorite teams compete at the highest level beginning this spring.

Newcomers to Dota 2 and LoL are unlikely to ever play at such a prestigious level of the game. But what makes them interesting, and altogether more fascinating, is their accessibility. While I love the NFL, my short stature and lack of bulging muscles generally means I will never play the sport at a professional level. The beauty behind esports is that it doesn't require your fitness level to replicate an in-his-prime Arnold Schwarzenegger. It simply requires a bit of ingenuity and a fully charged computer.

With a couple of simple clicks and a bit of luck, I could be playing with or, gulp, against one of the many professional Dota 2 players who practice on the game's server at any given time. I can only imagine making a one-handed catch near the back of the end zone against Darrelle Revis. But in Dota 2, I don't have to imagine making some ridiculous play; I can hop on my computer and hone my skills against every-day players.

It's this kind of access that originally drew me into the sport, but it's the inner workings of the game and varying strategies that I hope will keep you coming back for more.

espn.com,,Promoter Lou DiBella wins purse bid for Jose Pedraza-Stephen Smith bout,"['Dan Rafael', 'Pa Sport', 'Nigel Collins']","Promoter Lou DiBella won an IBF purse bid for $150,000 on Thursday for junior lightweight titlist Jose Pedraza's mandatory defense against Stephen Smith.

Attorney Alex Dombroff, DiBella Entertainment's representative, was the only person to bid at IBF headquarters in Springfield, New Jersey. Top Rank vice president Carl Moretti attended the purse bid but did not make an offer.

DiBella told ESPN that if both fighters sign bout agreements, the fight is slated to take place on April 16 (Showtime) at either the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Mashantucket, Connecticut or the Beau Rivage Resort & Casino, Biloxi, Mississippi.

DiBella co-promotes Pedraza with Gary Shaw and Javier Bustillo.

Last month, DiBella and Matchroom Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn, who promotes Smith, made a deal for the bout, which was tentatively scheduled for March 26. However, when the fight was not officially scheduled by the IBF deadline for signed contracts to be returned, another purse bid was ordered.

Usually, when that happens, it is because of a disagreement between promoters. However, this time it was over a disagreement between DiBella and Pedraza, who declined to sign for the fight.

Hearn told ESPN that he and DiBella revisited their agreement and that is why he did not bid.

""I didn't bid because we already reached an agreement with Lou a few days ago,"" Hearn said. ""We are happy with the package. The purse bid number is irrelevant because of our private agreement.""

Under the purse bid, Pedraza, as the titleholder, would receive 75 percent of the bid ($112,500) with Smith getting the remaining 25 percent ($37,500). However, under the deal DiBella and Hearn made, Smith will receive much more than that, although Hearn declined to say how much.

Pedraza was also offered far more than the $112,500 he is entitled to under the bid, but it remains to be seen whether DiBella and Pedraza can work things out and whether the fighter will sign a bout agreement.

Pedraza (21-0, 12 KOs), 26, of Puerto Rico, won the vacant belt by one-sided decision against Andrey Klimov in June and retained the title by split decision against Edner Cherry on Oct. 3. Smith (23-1, 13 KOs), 30, of England, achieved mandatory status with a sixth-round knockout of Devis Boschiero in their title eliminator on Sept. 19.

The April 16 Showtime telecast could also include two other bouts: featherweight world titleholder Gary Russell (26-1, 15 KOs), of Capitol Heights, Maryland, in his first defense against Ireland's Patrick Hyland (31-1, 15 KOs); and a light heavyweight fight between Worcester, Massachusetts, contender Edwin Rodriguez (28-1, 19 KOs) and Thomas Williams (19-1, 13 KOs), of Fort Washington, Maryland.

Those bouts were originally scheduled to take place March 12 at the Mohegan Sun Casino Resort in Uncasville, Connecticut but the card was postponed when welterweight titlist Keith Thurman suffered whiplash in a car accident, forcing his main event against former titleholder Shawn Porter to be delayed.",[]

espn.com,,Dan Szymborski's nostalgic look back at underperforming but memorable Hearthstone cards leaving competitive play,"['James Obscurica', 'James Bates', 'Alan Nahaz', 'Obscurica Chen', 'Stephen Chiu', 'Dan Szymborski', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Timothy Lee', 'Tyler Fionn', 'Arash Markazi']","In card games, sometimes the most underpowered cards find redemption. When looking at Hearthstone, one such card was Warsong Commander, a rarely played card from the Basic set that helped power Patron Warrior decks when that was easily the most frightening archetype on the competitive scene. Paladin secrets, a whole array of one-mana cards that rarely saw play, suddenly became powerful when combined with Mysterious Challenger. New cards can sometimes make some of the least played cards into staples of the most powerful decks.

With the introduction of Standard play, time has run out for the lesser lights from the Curse of Naxxramas and Goblins vs. Gnomes set to pen similar comeback stories. Since the Standard announcement, we've mostly focused on the strongest cards leaving competitive play -- cards such as Dr. Boom, Piloted Shredder, Mad Scientist and Sludge Belcher. But some of Blizzard's most entertaining but rarely played cards -- many of which are steeped in the World of Warcraft lore that has been a crucial staple of Hearthstone -- are also departing from the competitive scene. Some of these cards are overcosted. Some just never found a constructed deck that was a good home, or were just too difficult to enable. Let's give one last tribute to the coolest cards leaving play, before they depart for the Island of Misfit Toys (and the occasional Wild game played for nostalgia's sake).

Bolvar Fordragon

Blizzard

For those players familiar with World of Warcraft lore, seeing Bolvar Fordragon on a card was an exciting moment, as he played a crucial role in the Wrath of the Lich King expansion. His card, a five-mana 1/7 that gained +1 Attack for every card that died while he was in your hand, saw little tournament play. Goblins vs. Gnomes was released on December 8th, 2014 and, according to the tournament deck database at Hearthstone Top Deck, last saw competitive play just three weeks later. There's no denying that, even if Bolvar was a bad card, he was certainly a cool card. Octavian 'Kripparrian' Morosan of Team SoloMid, a Hearthstone caster and the most watched Hearthstone player in the world, shared his opinion of Bolvar with ESPN.

This card is a powerhouse on paper, often reaching double-digit attack levels, and having the health to back it up as well. It was always overlooked because of the extremely poor draw potential, as it takes a few turns sitting in your hand to actually reach its potential. But the real issue has been the other cards that were launched with him. Naxxramas and GvG brought the Deathrattle zoo and aggro themes to Hearthstone, and Silence came back in order to attempt to counter some of these effects. The strongest all-around legendary was also released in GvG, Dr. Boom, which forced most midrange and control decks to run Big Game Hunter just to counter it. Both of these factors consequently made Bolvar unplayable, as he does not escape the tech choices of the decks sourced from this set. In a different time, Bolvar could have been an amazing and common addition to midrange Paladin decks everywhere, but instead his fame will only live on in the Wrath of the Lich King expansion.

Gahz'rilla

Blizzard

A card that doubles its attack every time it took damage is a power effect. Gahz'rilla became a popular card to fool around with on fun videos -- if you could damage it three times on the board it became a crazy 48-attack card -- but a few problems kept it from ever seeing serious play, outside of the occasional Webspinner draw.

A seven-mana card typically has to have an immediate impact on the board to see play, and Hunter has limited resources to both get the Gahz'rilla to be usable immediately and to get the immediate damage on it to double its attack to 12. Further complicating its use was that successful Hunter archetypes, whether the Face Hunter or the slightly slower Midrange Hunter, simply didn't have time to use the card. Even assuming you could get Tundra Rhino to stick to the board, so that Gahz'rilla had Charge the next turn, you also had to assemble Gahz'rilla and a tool to damage it -- and most of the time, by the time you got all the pieces, the Hunter had already lost.

Wee Spellstopper

Blizzard

While Bolvar at least got experimented with in decks for a few weeks, Wee Spellstopper didn't even get that far, and was generally ignored from the start. The only card in the game to date with the ability to prevent other cards from being targeted, the Spellstopper never even found a niche as a defensive tech choice.

""This is one of those cards that I wish had worked in competitive play,"" explained Kacem 'Noxious' Khilaji of compLexity Gaming. ""It just failed miserably because it wasn't good enough on tempo. The card was there to protect your stuff, but it's not protected itself, so once it goes way, everything else dies as well.""

Blizzard

Anub'ar Ambusher and Dancing Swords

In a game in which board control is so important, cards with powerful stats but a crucial downside are a common feature found in decks. Early on in Hearthstone's history, King Mukla saw play in very aggressive decks, simply because getting a 5/5 card for three mana is worth giving your opponent +1/+1 Bananas -- because the intention was to kill the opponent before they ever got to make use of the buff cards. Deathlord, which put a card from your opponent's deck in play when it died, still saw play on-and-off simply because a 2/8 card with Taunt for three mana is a powerful tool against agro decks.

For Anub'ar Ambusher and Dancing Swords, the drawback turned out to be too much for what they brought to the table. While the Ambusher's deathrattle of sending another card back into your hand had potential synergy with certain Battlecry cards like Big Game Hunter, more often than not, the opponent, with first crack at killing it, got to choose the time to eliminate it -- frequently resulting in a loss of tempo. As for Dancing Swords, a 4/4 for three is nice, but giving your opponent a potential card in return for one more attack is typically a poor tradeoff, and the effect wasn't strong enough to see the Swords in mill decks.

Foe Reaper 4000

Blizzard

The Foe Reaper 4000 was one of my personal favorite unplayed cards in Naxxramas/GVG, both because of the powerful effect and, simply, the fact that it was essentially the Scarecrow from Wizard of Oz turned into an angry, out-of-control robot. Who doesn't love angry robots? Chris 'ChanmanV' Chan, host of Value Town shares my passion for this murderous mech:

""If the Foe Reaper stays on the board for a turn, it's impossible to remove, simply because of how it can clear the board all by itself. But it was also so hard to play because there are so many good single-target removal cards in Hearthstone and removing it from the board is always a priority. It's always been a favorite of mine, because if you were able to get it to stick, it didn't matter if you were going up against Patron Warrior, Handlock, or Secret Paladin, it would likely clear the board.""

Troggzor the Earthinator

Blizzard

Someone at Blizzard loves Homestar Runner, the internet series that created Trogdor the Burninator in 2003. Troggzor had an interesting effect, summoning a 3/5 Burly Rockjaw Trogg every time your opponent cast a spell. While the effect was similar to another defensive card, Loatheb -- a card that is also leaving the tournament meta, but has been a popular staple -- Troggzor only gave magic use long-term consequences rather than directly hindering it, as Loatheb did. One popular use of Loatheb was to hinder the Druid Force of Nature/Savage Roar combo for a turn, but Troggzor wouldn't stop it -- instead summoning two Burly Rockjaw Troggs in response, which didn't matter if you were already dead. While Hearthstone was (and remains) fairly light in seven-mana cards that you could just drop on a board, and Troggzor appeared to fit the bill, a better card released at the same time fulfilled that task even better: the much-reviled Dr. Boom.

Anima Golem

Blizzard

At six mana, a 9/9 card represents overwhelming power for its cost. But as you may have guessed, something that strong for that cheap has to come with a significant downside. In this case the drawback is that, at the end of each turn, if the Anima Golem is your only card on the board it has to be destroyed.

""That card looks like it should work in some circumstances,"" said Noxious. ""But even with Dreadsteed, there's no dependable way to enable it. Because of the setup required to make it work, it could be a six mana 25/25, and it dies just as often. You never get to attack with it.""

Sneed's Old Shredder

Blizzard

Sneed's, I will miss you most of all. Overcosted for its base stats, Sneed's Old Shredder was interesting because of the powerful Deathrattle, which summoned a random Legendary minion to takes its place after it died. Problem is, first you have to spend the eight mana to get an underpowered card on the board. Then you have to actually kill it and, only then, so long as it wasn't silenced, did you finally get that Deathrattle to trigger -- making it an incredibly slow card to wring value from. Getting a free Ragnaros or Archmage Antonidas is incredible, but if Nat Pagle or Lorewalker Cho popped from the Shredder, you were left cursing your opponent, Blizzard programmers, and the world that created you.

Sneed's saw some light play in tournaments after GvG release, but due to the drawbacks, its last competitive hurrah was in The Pinnacle 3 tournament, during which David 'Dog' Caero of Team Liquid and Jan 'Ek0p' Palys both included it in their decks -- but that was more than a year ago.

espn.com,,Oklahoma's Alec Hansen has great start,"['Keith Law', 'Eric Longenhagen']","Insider

Oklahoma right-hander Alec Hansen came into the season as a candidate for the top overall pick after spending his sophomore year pumping in an upper-90s fastball, a consistently plus slider and showing some feel for a changeup. He's a massive 6-foot-7, 235-pound leviathan whose arms are so long he can practically scratch his knees without bending at the waist. Pitchers built like that tend to take a while to harness their command and Hansen had been no different through his sophomore campaign. He went into last offseason needing to show scouts some signs that he could throw strikes where he wanted and that would probably be enough to have him in the conversation for the top overall pick.

Things began to go awry. Hansen sat out Oklahoma's fall season with forearm soreness. He dealt with a similarly described issue toward the end of his senior year of high school and has a screw in his elbow because of it. His opening start this season was a one-inning, four-walk disaster while his underwhelming second start -- three innings, three hits, three walks allowed -- had to be pushed back a day.

On Saturday, Hansen bounced back as well as one could have hoped, striking out 11 and walking just one over 6&frac13; innings of work against a UCLA Bruins team loaded with mature, high-contact hitters. Hansen's fastball sat 94-98 mph early in the start, backed down into the low 90s late (understandable given that he had thrown only four innings prior to the start this season) and featured inconsistent movement. It's a plus-plus pitch, especially when it's moving, and Hansen located it down in the zone and to both sides of the plate with regularity. If I were to ignore Hansen's history of wildness and just view this start in a vacuum, I'd be comfortable projecting above average command.

I do think Hansen's delivery is about as simple as it gets for someone his size. He has some drop and drive to him -- which I'm fine with from a 6-7 pitcher as he still generates plenty of downward plane -- and cuts off his front side a bit but generally moves his significant mass directly toward the plate. Saturday's start gave me some confidence that Hansen could one day pitch with acceptable major league starter command with his current delivery and get there consistently simply through reps.",[]

The panel for the Valspar Championship features ESPN.com's Jason Sobel, Kevin Maguire, Matt Barrie, Bob Harig, Jonathan Coachman and Michael Collins, and FantasyGolfInsider's Roger Casey, Jeff Bergerson and Zach Turcotte, as well as Dailyfantasybootcamp.com's Alvin Zeidenfeld and David Jayne.

Note: Golfer salaries listed are for DraftKings.

Jason Sobel -- Justin Thomas ($10,000)

I had the opportunity to play the Copperhead course at Innisbrook recently and got a chance to see the new greens firsthand. They're all redone since last year, and while they're rolling smooth, they're also extremely bouncy. By that logic, I'm looking at players who rank highest in the ""apex height"" category of ball-striking. Thomas is second on the PGA Tour this season and first of those who will be in Tampa this week. Hitting higher shots should allow for less bounce, which will be even more important than usual.

Editor's Picks High should help out at Valspar Championship With completely redone greens at this week's PGA Tour stop -- Innisbrook's Copperhead Course -- high-ball hitters might be a prudent play for your DFS team.

Jonathan Coachman -- Patrick Reed ($10,400)

I am learning that the top players of today's game are not Tiger Woods. Missed cuts are going to happen, and that's OK. So I have no problem picking a player who has not been in form lately, but does have recent positive history at this course. Reed played too much golf from October through February and fatigue set in. Last year, he made a huge putt to get into a playoff at the Valspar Championship and then Jordan Spieth won on the third extra hole. Reed gets back on the winning track this week.

Kevin Maguire -- Graeme McDowell ($9,200)

He has never played the Copperhead Course at Innisbrook, but don't be surprised if it sets up well for the Northern Irishman, who ranks fourth on the PGA Tour in driving accuracy. He has cashed checks at all but one start so far in the wraparound season, so getting to the weekend shouldn't be a problem.

Bob Harig -- Henrik Stenson ($11,500)

Long overdue for a win, Stenson finished fourth in his first try at Innisbrook a year ago. At No. 7, he's the second-highest-ranked player in the field, behind only Jordan Spieth.

Matt Barrie -- Kevin Na ($9,100)

He has a chance this week to take advantage of an Adam Scott-Rory McIlroy-Bubba Watson-Jason Day-less Field. While Na will still have to contend with world No. 1 Jordan Spieth, Na's game is suited for a course like Copperhead that doesn't require top-of-tour length. Na has recorded four top-three finishes this season, and has had success in this event, including a second-place finish in 2014. Na is a good look this week.

Michael Collins -- Lucas Glover ($6,600)

This week I'm swinging for the fences. The Copperhead course demands being good off the tee and so far this year, Glover leads the tour in total driving (distance plus accuracy). Even though he's coming off two missed cuts, I think the week off did him good and you'll all be calling me psychic by the end of the week.

Jeff Bergerson -- Jason Dufner ($9,400)

If you think it has been difficult getting all the guys on your DraftKings rosters through the cut so far this season, just wait until this week. My goal this week is to identify those players with the absolute best chance to accumulate points over the weekend, and Jason Dufner is my top choice. In his last seven appearances here at Copperhead, Dufner has not finished worse than 28th. This season he has only missed one cut, has three top 10s, and a T-11 last week at the WGC-Cadillac. His game sets up nicely for this course as he is strong in many of the key statistical categories this week, including strokes gained tee-to-green, driving accuracy and birdie or better percentage. I especially like the fact that Dufner is priced outside of the top 10 golfers at $9,400.

Zach Turcotte -- Harris English ($9,600)

Dependability is one of the more underrated attributes for golfers when selecting a lineup each week. Too often, a player like Harris English will get overlooked as he lacks the big wins on Tour to generate a lot of buzz from week to week. Given the recent volatile environment in DFS golf where few squads are getting the full compliment of players through the cut, the ability to get to the weekend is more important than ever before. English has ascended from cut-maker status to cut-maker with upside this season. He has finished in the top 10 in two high-quality events in his last three starts and has finished in the top 10 at Copperhead in two of the last three seasons as well. His tee-to-green game and putting keep him competitive each week and should keep him out of trouble more often than his fellow competitors, a huge key at a challenging course like this.

Roger Casey -- Danny Lee ($8,000)

Danny Lee is such an obnoxiously versatile golfer that I can only imagine that his bomber counterparts who have enjoyed less success in the past year must be very, very frustrated. While Danny is not long off the tee, he is an absolutely outstanding iron player from virtually any distance and a first-rate putter on top of that. We saw what he can do when he ran the table on the Greenbrier last year and was very much in position to take down Phoenix this year. After a few disappointing finishes, there's no better buy-low opportunity on a guy at his $8,000 price tag than Lee at this event, where he finished tied for seventh place last year.

Alvin Zeidenfeld -- Kevin Na ($9,100)

While the recent form is a bit troubling to me (Na has missed cut in his last two tournaments with a cut line, and has ended with a score over par in each of his last three tournaments), his course history at Copperhead is very solid. Na has two top-10 finishes the past two years at this event, including a second place two years ago. Na also provides a salary value when compared to his Vegas odds this week, which is typically tough to find at the higher end of the salary spectrum. I'll be able to lock in Kevin Na as well as another high priced golfer to give me a chance at the top of the leaderboards. Sign me up.

David Jayne -- Harris English ($9,600)

English makes for a solid building block having only missed one cut since May of last year. He has recently flashed some upside with a third-place finish in Phoenix and a top 10 at Doral last week. Not only does he have two top 10s in the last three appearances here, but he also won the 2011 Southern Amateur at this course with a bogey-free 65 to win by three strokes. In 2015, Harris ranked 36th in scrambling, 10th in strokes gained putting, and 14th in par 3 birdie or better percentage (this course has five par 3's). While Jordan Spieth and Henrik Stenson are certainly solid options this week, if you are looking to build a more balanced team, consider starting it with English.",[]

The decision was issued on Wednesday, when the league issued a one-paragraph statement announcing it had completed its independent review of the allegations against Kane. The final step of the investigation occurred on Monday, when Kane met with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman in New York.

The investigation began in August, when Kane was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in her 20s at his offseason home outside of Buffalo, New York.

It marked the 34-year-old Sanchez's 23rd trip to the Octagon, which moves him into a tie for ninth-most in company history.

""I've got a masterful coaching staff that put a great game plan together,"" Sanchez said. ""I knew if I hit him enough times in the body he would start to slow down. I was just trying to get back in the win column.""

Sanchez, from Albuquerque, New Mexico, took Miller down midway through Round 1 and controlled him the rest of the round. He didn't score a ton of significant damage from top position but clearly won the round.

Miller (25-8) evened the score in the second round, as he found a frequent home for the counter left hand. He visibly hurt Sanchez with a high head kick, but Sanchez did well backing up and circling out of trouble. Later in the round, Sanchez attempted to get it back to the floor but Miller countered with a guillotine.

In the third round, Sanchez stole back momentum to win the fight. He started to find a rhythm on the feet and landed several good right hands. The win improves him to 2-1 in his last three. He also rebounds from a loss to Ricardo Lamas in a 145-pound fight in November. Miller is 1-4 in his last five.

""I'm just looking to get back soon and continue to fight on big cards,"" Miller said. ""The only thing I can guarantee is when I fight, I'll fight my butt off. I can't guarantee that I'll win.""

Light heavyweight Ilir Latifi (12-5) defeated Gian Villante (14-7) via unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 30-27).

Latifi, of Sweden, landed only 23 total strikes in the contest compared to Villante's 37, according to Fightmetric, but he scored several takedowns. Latifi also staggered Villante with a big overhand left in Round 3.

Villante, who fights out of New York, falls to 4-4 in the UFC.

""I knew Gian was a tough fighter and I was prepared for a tough fight,"" Latifi said. ""I'm coming for the belt, whoever is in my way, I am coming. I would like to fight Ryan Bader or anyone else in the top five.""

Light heavyweight Corey Anderson (8-1) earned a unanimous decision (30-27, 30-27, 29-28) over veteran Tom Lawlor (11-5), good for his third win in a row.

The 30-27 scores were a bit surprising, as Lawlor hurt Anderson badly in the opening round with right uppercuts and appeared on the verge of knocking him out. Anderson out-struck Lawlor 66-35, however, according to Fightmetric and scored a takedown in the final round.

""It was a good fight, it was a battle and I enjoyed it because I knew it would be a tough fight with Tom,"" Anderson said. ""I just want to keep moving up the ladder and sometimes this game isn't about beating ranked opponents but instead it's about building yourself.""

Lawlor, 32, saw a two-fight win streak snapped. After years of competing at 185 pounds, Lawlor has now fought twice at 205.

Female bantamweight Amanda Nunes (12-4) strengthened her case for a future title shot, as she extended her win streak to three with a decisive win over Valentina Shevchenko (12-2). Three judges scored the bout for Nunes, 29-27, 29-27 and 29-28.

Fighting out of Coconut Creek, Florida, Nunes took Shevchenko down in the first two rounds and nearly finished her with a rear-naked choke.

Nunes faded in the last round but Shevchenko couldn't mount a strong enough comeback to overcome the poor start.

""I am ready to get my title shot,"" Nunes said. ""I've fought top-five opponents for a while now, but now it's my time. Every day I am bringing in new training and technique and I am very proud of myself for what I am accomplishing.""

Welterweight Siyar Bahadurzada (22-6-1) submitted Brandon Thatch (11-4) via arm-triangle at 4:11 of the third round, ending a two-fight skid in the process.

Thatch looked good in a few early exchanges, but Bahadurzada consistently answered back with heavy boxing. He hurt Thatch with a left hook in the third before wrapping up the finish.

Bahadurzada was making his first appearance in the cage since December 2013. Thatch, once considered a strong prospect in the welterweight division, suffered his third consecutive defeat.

Featherweight Darren Elkins (20-5) earned a grueling decision over Chas Skelly (15-2) by judges' scores of 30-27, 30-26 and 29-27.

Elikins relentlessly smothered Skelly with takedown attempts and cautious-but-effective striking.

Elkins landed several good left hooks early and scored takedowns in all three rounds. Skelly appeared tired late as Elkins, who fights out of Team Alpha Male, continued to pressure him everywhere. Elkins improved to 10-4 in the UFC.

""The move to Team Alpha Male has been great,"" Elkins said. ""The energy has really changed for me and the coaching staff is great. I really needed a change and the environment over there has really rejuvenated me. I know Chas is a younger guy, but I knew a lot about him, my coaches studied him a lot and we had a lot of film on him.""",[]

espn.com,,The Road To The Beer Mile World Record,['Mackenzie Lobhavey'],"The Road To The Beer Mile World Record

Kirby Lee/USA TODAY Sports Last December in Austin, Herndon won the inaugural Flotrack Beer Mile World Championships with a time of 6 minutes 17.76 seconds.

Elizabeth Herndon is an assistant professor in the Department of Geology at Kent State University. She's also the women's world record holder of the beer mile.

Last December in Austin, Herndon won the inaugural Flotrack Beer Mile World Championships with a time of 6 minutes 17.76 seconds. (She's also a competitive marathoner -- sans beer -- and, safe to say, she's likely the coolest college professor you could hope to have.)

A test of speed and chugging ability, the beer mile requires competitors to drink a 12-ounce can of beer, run a lap around a 400-meter track, drink, run, drink, run, drink, run. Runners must finish the entirety of their brews. Purging -- voluntarily or involuntarily -- will get you disqualified.

This year's race will be held Tuesday night in Austin. While Herndon, 30, won't be defending her crown, we sat down with her to learn a little about her unlikely road to an unlikely world championship.

espnW: How did you discover you had a talent for the beer mile?

Herndon: The ability to drink large volumes of liquid very quickly is somewhat of a natural talent. At restaurants, I'm the person who drinks their glass of water before the waitress can even leave the table. I also used to drink a lot of Diet Coke, so I had some experience with the carbonation. I didn't specifically try the beer mile until a few years ago, but I did pretty well the first time (7:24). Running with the beer in my stomach didn't seem to bother me too much, which is a key component of the beer mile.

espnW: Do your skills mostly lie in chugging beer, running fast, or some of both?

Herndon: It's definitely a mix of chugging and running fast, but certainly a big component is being able to tolerate the beer sloshing around inside your stomach. I certainly wasn't the fastest person there, but I did have the fastest running splits. Interestingly, I was able to run about as fast as I can without drinking beer!

espnW: What made you settle on drinking the Belgian-style Fat Tire for the Beer Mile World Championships? What other beers did you test out?

Herndon: My husband and I practiced chugging with a couple different beers, and I found that Fat Tire was pretty smooth and pleasant to drink. We also tried Sierra Nevada (too flavorful) and PBR (too foamy), and I used Molson, Blue Moon and Yuengling in past beer miles. Fat Tire was a clear winner.

espnW: How did you prepare for the race, in terms of run training and beer drinking?

Herndon: I didn't adjust my running at all, but thankfully I was training for a 5k when the beer mile came around. Normally I'm a marathoner, so the 5k speed workouts were definitely helpful. I was doing track workouts once a week with my team (Cleveland Elite Development). For beer mile-specific training, I tried chugging a few different beers over the course of a few weeks before the race. I wanted to find the right beer and practice the proper technique.

espnW: Can you describe the physical sensation of chugging a beer and then running a fast lap -- and repeating that four times?

Herndon: The hardest part was trying to breathe and drink beer at the same time. I ended up taking many very short sips of beer just so I could breathe also. The beer itself gets pretty painful by the end. There's some definite side-cramp issues.

espnW: Did you go into the race thinking you had a good chance of winning?

Herndon: Definitely! I knew there would be a lot of competition, but I felt strongly that I was a contender for the win. My friends love that the announcers called me ""the one no one talked about!"" as I came into the finish. My strategy was to keep the running controlled so that I could handle the chug.

espnW: What is the appeal of doing this kind of event?

Herndon: I think we often take life much too seriously. The beer mile is a great opportunity to be a little ridiculous and challenge yourself in a unique and fun way.

espnW: What else are you training for right now?

Herndon: Right now I'm training for some local road races, and then I'm focused on the Olympic marathon trials in February in L.A. I have a great team that I'm fortunate to run with a couple times a week, and they make the process a total joy.

From first-time yogis to veteran triathletes, each body in motion is a successful one. We created the My Body Can movement to celebrate that notion, and now we want to hear from you. Tag a photo or video with #MyBodyCan, and share with the espnW community the amazing things your body can do!",[]
espn.com,,Sliding track for 2018 Olympics dealing with ice issues,"['Johnette Howard', 'Espn Staff', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Adriana Terrazas', 'Bonnie D']","A key testing period for the venue that will host luge, bobsled and skeleton events at the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics has been scrapped for now and pushed back until at least October because workers were unable to coat the track with ice.

Organizers said the Alpensia Sliding Centre's refrigeration system failed, and a group of international sliders who were there to assess the venue are all heading home without getting any full runs. It's a significant setback for the track, and workers now may have to scramble for the venue to become fully certified for pre-Olympic test events that are scheduled for next winter.

""Not the best first impression,"" USA Luge veteran Chris Mazdzer of Saranac Lake, New York, told The Associated Press on Saturday.

Sliders had been invited to test the track's safety, ensure the venue is technically sound and suggest any possible changes. They were expecting to get 12 runs or more down the track. Instead, they got only a handful of slides down the lower portion of the chute, not enough to make any useful assessments of the facility.

""The refrigeration plant is not currently stabilized to operate at maximum capacity and current weather conditions prevented the ability to maintain the ice,"" track officials said in a statement.

The refrigeration system worked on the lower part of the track, but not the upper portion. Despite requests from organizers to not share photos, some athletes such as Russian luger Albert Demchenko posted images on Facebook showing bare concrete on large swaths of the track.

""It looks like it will be a tremendous facility,"" U.S. skeleton coach Zach Lund, who was in South Korea to observe the testing, said Saturday. ""The track looks like it will be very hard and technical and the area is nice. They just had some bad luck with their refrigeration system and then struggled to accept it. Overall, I think everything will be fine by next season.""

Approval must occur before any new track can be certified by the governing bodies for the sliding sports and this delay is going to create some logistical headaches for sliders next season.

The idea of adding a long trip to South Korea shortly before the grueling World Cup season begins in North America and Europe is far from ideal, which is why such test periods typically happen at this time of year -- after the international sliding schedules are completed.

Mazdzer said October will be an ""interesting time"" to go through such a process because ""people are just getting on their sleds and getting comfortable. He also noted that most teams have their own selection races around that time.

Mazdzer said sliders have been making the best of the situation. He went swimming one day, skiing another and was touring temples on Saturday. Instead of sliding Sunday and Monday as planned, he's going to Seoul for a quick vacation before flying back to the U.S.

There are tentative plans for bobsled, skeleton and luge athletes to have training weeks on the new track next winter before the Olympics there the following year.",[]

espn.com,,Signing Marvin Jones is big for Lions' transition from Calvin Johnson,['Michael Rothstein'],"In Calvin Johnsons retirement statement Tuesday, Detroit Lions general manager Bob Quinn acknowledged replacing the man called Megatron could not be done by one player.

Less than a day later, though, the Lions are starting the transition after agreeing to a deal with Cincinnati Bengals receiver Marvin Jones. The move cant be official until the start of the new league year at 4 p.m. ET on Wednesday, but it fills a glaring void for Detroit in its receiver corps.

Jones was the best possible option among free agent receivers for the Lions, especially after Chicago tagged Alshon Jeffery, keeping him off the market. Jones has the size at 6-foot-2 that the Lions covet and didnt have in their receiving corps after Johnson retired. He also has good enough speed to be a downfield threat. Hes also just 25 years old, meaning hes going to be hitting his prime and should be a Detroit asset for years to come.

He could combine with tight end Eric Ebron to give Detroit two field-stretching players who would allow Golden Tate to continue to work the short and intermediate routes he has become so adept at exploiting.

Marvin Jones proved himself as a deep threat with the Bengals. Aaron Doster/USA TODAY Sports

Jones has never put up the eye-popping numbers Johnson did in his career. He has never had a 1,000-yard season. He missed all of 2014 to injury. But he has been a deep threat as a receiver and has often been the No. 2 option to A.J. Green. Now hes coming into a situation where hell be a co-No. 1 with Tate in an offense that needs passing success.

Hes also a smart signing because he understands what it is like to play in cold weather in November and December since he spent his time in the AFC North, with trips to Pittsburgh and Cleveland and home games outside in Cincinnati.

He also has pretty sure hands. Hes dropped only six of his 207 targets in his career and has a career reception rate of 64.7 percent. He has 134 receptions in the three years he played with the Bengals for 1,729 yards and 15 touchdowns.

Those numbers will not sound good compared to Johnsons career totals  his total career yardage is less than Johnsons record-breaking 1,964-yard season in 2012. But Jones isnt going to be expected to replace Johnson all on his own.

The potential is there for him to break out in Detroits offense, especially with a bunch of targets to go around and attention paid to the Lions multitude of other receiving options. No matter what Jones provides, though, replacing Johnson is going to be a collaborative effort among Jones, Tate, Ebron, the Lions running backs and whoever ends up filling out the depth chart at receiver.

Bringing in Jones as a free agent signing, though, nudges the Lions into the future in a positive way.

Heres what Bengals reporter Coley Harvey told me Wednesday morning about what the Lions will be getting in Jones:

Jones should provide Matthew Stafford with a good vertical threat as the Lions try to move on following Calvin Johnson's retirement. By no means will Jones be able to replace Megatron all on his own, but he can be a good complementary receiver with a quarterback who knows how to get him the ball. Physical, tough -- some of Jones' best catches in a Bengals uniform came when he was either being contested for a jump ball, or needed to fight through defenders for extra yards. The Bengals knew the odds were high they would lose Jones, but he's certainly going to be a hit to their locker room and sideline. With Jones' former offensive coordinator, Hue Jackson, and his Browns in the mix for the receiver's services, Detroit might have pulled off one of the biggest steals of free agency.",[]

1. Tyson Fury (25-0)

England's Fury came into his mandatory shot against long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko on Klitschko's turf in Germany on Nov. 28. Owning a rare size advantage and a certain swagger about him, he pulled off a remarkable upset. Fury shut down the usually dominant Klitschko and ended his 912-year championship run to win the world title, although both guys performed poorly in a terrible fight. It was just that Fury was less bad than Klitschko, who quickly decided to exercise his right to an immediate rematch. They will meet again as soon as April but probably no later than June. Because Fury is bound to a rematch, he was stripped of one of the alphabet belts for declining to fight mandatory challenger Vyacheslav Glazkov.

Next: TBA vs. Klitschko

2. Wladimir Klitschko (64-4)

During his 912-year title reign -- second-longest in heavyweight history -- Klitschko successfully defended the title 18 times, third most in division history. He had an 1112-year undefeated run and won 22 fights in a row. But then he defended against Fury and showed virtually nothing, perhaps growing old before our eyes at age 39. He landed an abysmal 52 of 231 punches (23 percent) in their Nov. 28 fight in Germany and lost a clear decision in a terrible fight to a guy who didn't do all that much more than he did. But a loss is a loss and Klitschko's historic reign came to an ignominious end. He will look to start another one as he decided to go for the immediate rematch he had the contractual right to have.

Next: TBA vs. Fury

3. Alexander Povetkin (30-1)

Russia's Povetkin, a former secondary titleholder, is the mandatory challenger for titleholder Deontay Wilder (36-0) and was ringside in New York for Wilder's Jan.16 knockout victory as their sides held negotiations for the fight. They did not make a deal and it went to a purse bid, which Povetkin's side won with a surprisingly high bid of $7.15 million. The fight is due to take place by the end of May.

Next: TBA vs. Wilder

4. Deontay Wilder (36-0)

Wilder, the 2008 U.S. Olympic bronze medalist, fought a collection of has-beens and nobodies until facing a real opponent in Bermane Stiverne in January 2015. Wilder passed that test and won a world title by one-sided decision, and has since scored knockouts against three less-than-impressive challengers, Eric Molina, Frenchman Johann Duhaupas and Poland's Artur Szpilka, whom he erased in the ninth round with one shot on Jan. 16. Next up will be a mandatory defense against a legitimate opponent in Povetkin. Wilder could be headed to Russia for the fight since Povetkin's side surprisingly won the purse bid for $7.15 million.

Next: TBA vs. Povetkin

5. Luis Ortiz (25-0)

A 6-foot-4, 240-pound southpaw with raw power, Ortiz, a Cuban defector with tons of amateur experience, claimed vacant interim belt in October by blasting out no-hoper Matias Ariel Vidondo. That win did not prove much but Ortiz made a massive statement in his next fight that he is a force to be reckoned with when he put on an extremely impressive display en route to a crowd-pleasing seventh-round knockout of former title challenger Bryant Jennings on Dec. 19 in an HBO-televised main event. Finding an opponent willing to face ""The Real King Kong"" was difficult, but veteran former two-time title challenger Tony Thompson accepted the assignment for the HBO main event on March 5 and got knocked down three times and knocked out in the sixth round for his trouble. Golden Boy hopes Ortiz will return to fight May 7 on the Canelo Alvarez-Amir Khan HBO PPV card.

Next: TBA

6. Bermane Stiverne (25-2-1)

Stiverne's first title defense on Jan. 17 against mandatory challenger Wilder could not have gone worse, as he lost a wide unanimous decision and his title then spent two nights in a Las Vegas hospital being treated for severe dehydration. He passed on a return bout for an interim title against Ortiz on Oct. 17 on the Gennady Golovkin-David Lemieux HBO PPV undercard and instead returned Nov. 14 in an untelevised bout in which he got knocked down in the first round but won a tight decision against journeyman Derric Rossy.

Next: TBA

7. Kubrat Pulev (22-1)

Bulgaria's Pulev, a 2008 Olympian, got his mandatory title shot against Klitschko on Nov. 15, 2014, and got hammered. Pulev landed a couple of solid right hands, but Klitschko abused the challenger with left hooks, dropping him four times with that weapon in a brutal fifth-round knockout. Pulev made his ring return on Oct. 17 and pounded out an eight-round shutout victory against 41-year-old Argentine journeyman George Arias. On Dec.5, Pulev fought again and blew out journeyman Maurice Harris in the first round.

Next: TBA

8. Bryant Jennings (19-2)

Although Philadelphia's Jennings lost a lopsided decision to then-champion Klitschko on April 25, he had a couple of good moments in the bout and exceeded expectations by lasting the distance against an all-time great champion. Jennings returned on Dec. 19 to challenge Ortiz for his interim title in an HBO main event. It was a terrific action fight but Jennings could not handle Ortiz's power. He repeatedly hurt Jennings until finally knocking him down and stopping him in the seventh round.

Next: TBA

9. Lucas Browne (24-0)

Browne traveled to Russia for a mandatory shot at secondary titleholder Ruslan Chagaev on March 5 and despite being cut over his left eye and on his forehead, and suffering a hard knockdown in the sixth round, he rallied for a 10th-round knockout in an upset. The victory made him the first Australian fighter to win a heavyweight title. Next he is mandated to face former title challenger Fres Oquendo (37-8).

Next: TBA vs. Oquendo

10. Ruslan Chagaev (34-3-1)

After Uzbekistan native Chagaev blew away Francesco Pianeta in the first round to retain his secondary title in July, he was due to give Fres Oquendo a court-ordered rematch in October in Germany. However, Oquendo suffered a serious shoulder injury in training and the fight was canceled. With Oquendo out indefinitely, Chagaev faced Australian mandatory challenger Lucas ""Big Daddy"" Browne on March 5 in Russia. Chagaev dropped Browne, busted him up and was winning when Browne rallied for an upset 10th-round knockout.

The 30-year-old Manxman is to ride the six-discipline omnium in which he is targeting a place at the Rio Olympics.

Cavendish, a 26-time Tour de France stage winner, will also partner Sir Bradley Wiggins in the two-man Madison, British Cycling announced on Tuesday.

The pair won the event at the 2008 Track World Championships in Manchester, but finished ninth at the Olympics in Beijing later that year.

Cavendish suffered the ignominy of being the only member of the British track team in Beijing to finish without a medal and vowed never to return to the velodrome, having ended his Tour de France participation early to travel to China.

Yet the following March he took part in the 2009 Track World Championships in Pruszkow, Poland -- his most recent global championships across the boards until now.

The London event takes place from Mar. 2 to 6 at the Lee Valley VeloPark.

GB team for the UCI Track World Championships, London Women's sprint: Becky James, Katy Marchant, Jess Varnish.

Men's sprint: Matt Crampton, Phil Hindes, Jason Kenny, Callum Skinner

Women's endurance: Katie Archibald, Elinor Barker, Ciara Horne, Emily Nelson, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Laura Trott

Men's endurance: Steven Burke, Mark Cavendish, Ed Clancy, Jon Dibben, Owain Doull, Chris Latham, Andy Tennant, Sir Bradley Wiggins.

It was while watching the Olympic track programme at the 2012 Games, after Cavendish had placed 29th in the road race, that the seeds were sown for Rio.

Cavendish declared then his desire to return to the track to bid for the Olympic medal which has proved elusive.

Olympic success could be part of a memorable 2016 for Cavendish, as he also targets the Tour de France yellow jersey for the first time and the World Championships road race title in October.

Wiggins, after becoming the first British winner of the Tour de France before adding Olympic time-trial gold, also expressed his wish to return to the velodrome during London 2012.

The 35-year-old's main focus is the four-man, four-kilometres team pursuit as he gears up for his bid for a fifth Olympic gold and British record eighth medal in all.

He returns to the venue where he set the UCI Hour Record last June.

The pair's participation in London is a big boost for a track team still struggling to fill the void of the post-2012 departures of Sir Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.

Britain last year in Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines failed to win a Track World Championships gold medal for the first time since 2001.

Ed Clancy won omnium bronze at London 2012, but is recovering from a back injury, giving Cavendish the opportunity to take the British place in track cycling's equivalent of the decathlon.

Clancy, twice a team pursuit Olympic champion, has been included in a squad of 21 riders, along with fellow London 2012 gold medallists Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Steven Burke, Jason Kenny and Phil Hindes.

Former world champion Katie Archibald is included following injury, too. Becky James, who won two world titles in 2013 before being beset by illness and injury, leads the women's sprint group.

Emily Nelson and Chris Latham have been named in their first Track World Championships squad.

British Cycling technical director Shane Sutton said: ""We've selected the strongest squad available to us for these worlds -- we're in good shape and the team we've selected is close to the Olympic model.""",[]

Stenson finished runner-up six times worldwide in 2015 and was also fourth on his debut at Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club, just one shot outside of the three-man play-off between Spieth, Patrick Reed and Sean O'Hair.

Spieth emerged victorious on the third extra hole to move up to sixth in the world and claim what was just his second PGA Tour title at the time, a win he followed with further triumphs in the Masters, US Open, John Deere Classic and Tour Championship.

""I hope I can put myself in a similar position,"" Stenson, who carded a closing 67 last year, told a pre-tournament press conference. ""Of course, that's always the goals for Sundays. It was a pretty close chance last year so, yeah, we'll see.

""I can't say I'm coming in with the same great finish at Doral that I had last year [fourth last year, 28th last week] so I might have to work a little bit more on my game this week and hopefully step it up a notch.

""I think it's a good golf course for me. I played it for the first time last year and got to hit some good iron shots into the greens and that seems to suit my game pretty well.

""Winning on any Tour anywhere is always a confidence boost and as golfers we don't get to do that that often, given how many participants you have and how tough the competition is.

""A win at the right time is definitely huge for your confidence and why not make it here? It kick-started last year for Jordan and I wouldn't mind getting a win.

""It's been a little while and I came close a few times last year so I feel like I'm ready for one.""

Stenson, who will play the first two rounds alongside world number one Spieth and Bill Haas, underwent knee surgery in December and confirmed he would miss the WGC-Dell Match Play in a fortnight's time in order to rest ahead of the Masters.

""I didn't feel like I could play six weeks in a row leading up to Augusta,"" the 39-year-old Swede added. ""Something had to give and it was the Match Play week this time.

""I'm still not 100 per cent but it's good enough to play and it doesn't hurt hitting shots and so on, but I limped out of the car after driving just over two hours from Orlando. It's a little stiff when you're sitting in a static position like that but hopefully it gets better and better and within three to six months it should be done and over with.""

Spieth started 2016 with an eight-shot win in the Hyundai Tournament of Champions in Hawaii and was fifth in Abu Dhabi and second in Singapore, but missed the cut in the Northern Trust Open and was never in contention in the WGC-Cadillac Championship before finishing 17th.

(1:37)

Quarterback Brock Osweiler, the assumed heir apparent to Peyton Manning in Denver, instead will sign with the Houston Texans for four years and $72 million, a source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter.

Editor's Picks Texans spend $126 million on Brock Osweiler, two others Houston went on a shopping spree on the first day of free agency, boosting an offense that wasn't nearly as good as the team's defense.

Brock Osweiler's departure puts Broncos on hunt for quarterback With Brock Osweiler's departure, the Broncos have questions at a foundation position both now and down the road.

Brock Osweiler should give Texans' offense needed stability Brock Osweiler, despite his inflated price, is a clear upgrade from the quarterback carousel Houston has endured in recent years, writes Sam Monson. 2 Related

He will be joined by former Miami Dolphins running back Lamar Miller, who has agreed to a four-year, $26 million contract with the Texans, a source told Schefter. Miller will receive $14 million guaranteed, the source said.

A source also told ESPN's Adam Caplan that former Kansas City Chiefs guard/tackle Jeff Allen is expected to sign a four-year, $28 million deal with Houston.

The NFL Network first reported Osweiler's decision to jump to Houston from the defending Super Bowl champion Broncos. Osweiler's decision comes two days after Manning retired from the Broncos.

As part of Osweiler's contract, he will receive $37 million guaranteed, a source told ESPN's Ed Werder.

By signing Osweiler, the Texans are seeking to improve their ruinous quarterback situation from 2015. Owner Bob McNair has publicly demanded the Texans find a solution at the position more than once this offseason, though his focus has been on the draft.

In the 2015 offseason, Houston signed Ryan Mallett and Brian Hoyer to backup quarterback-level deals then allowed the veterans to compete for the starting job.

Hoyer won the job but threw an interception on his first pass of the season. He was benched during the Texans' Week 1 game, and coach Bill O'Brien replaced him with Mallett as the starter for the next four games. Mallett went 1-3 and lost his job to Hoyer during his fourth start. O'Brien later said he shouldn't have benched Hoyer so quickly.

Osweiler started seven games in 2015 after replacing the injured Manning, who was recovering from a tear in his plantar fascia near his left heel, but Manning reclaimed the quarterback job for the playoff run.

The Broncos had worked diligently since their win in Super Bowl 50 to re-sign Osweiler, groomed to be the future starter since he was their second-round pick in the 2012 draft. That was the same year the Broncos signed Manning in free agency.

""We've stayed true to our philosophy of building a team with players who want to be Denver Broncos and want to be here,"" Broncos executive vice president and general manager John Elway said Wednesday. ""That's been a successful approach for us.""

""While we did offer a very competitive and fair long-term contract to Brock, we ultimately had to remain disciplined while continuing to assemble a roster that can compete for championships,"" Elway said.

The 25-year-old Osweiler waited until the 2015 season to make his first regular-season starts in the NFL. Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said at the scouting combine while that extended wait might have been difficult for Osweiler, it may have helped the quarterback's game overall with a more traditional developmental approach.

Miller, 24, rushed for 872 yards and scored 10 total touchdowns last season. At times he was dynamic for the Dolphins, but too often Miller was ignored in the offense. He had six games last season with single-digit rushing attempts.

As a result, Miller failed to reach his goal of back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons heading into free agency.

""I think I did all right,"" Miller said after the season in January. ""Of course I wanted to get 1,000 yards. That was my goal coming into this season, but that didn't happen. But I think I did a good job with my opportunities to try to help this team win and just try to make plays.""

Miller put together a solid resume the past two years as a full-time starter. He rushed for 1,971 yards and scored 19 total touchdowns in that span.

Osweiler likely spent more time with Manning over the past four seasons than any other coach or player inside the team's Dove Valley complex. Osweiler has consistently said he wanted to be a starter and believed he could be but added that he ""didn't want to waste a moment of the time working with Peyton.""

The Broncos were 5-2 in games Osweiler started in 2015, though he was pulled in the third quarter of the regular-season finale. Two of Osweiler's wins were overtime victories over the New England Patriots and Cincinnati Bengals, which helped the Broncos earn home-field advantage in the playoffs.

Osweiler finished the season with 1,967 yards passing with 10 touchdowns and six interceptions. He had three games with at least 296 yards passing -- losses to Oakland and Pittsburgh to go with the win over Cincinnati.

Perhaps the only developmental concern is the number of sacks Osweiler took last season. He was sacked 20 times in his starts -- a span of just over 27 quarters' worth of work. Osweiler was listed on the injury report over those seven starts for shoulder, rib, elbow and knee injuries.

Hoyer started nine games for the Texans last season and went 5-4. His completion percentage of 60.7 ranked 25th in the NFL, his yards per attempt of 7.06 ranked 24th, and his Total QBR ranked 19th. He threw only seven interceptions in the regular season but tossed four of them in the Texans' 30-0 playoff loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.

In all, Houston started four quarterbacks in their 9-7 campaign, using Hoyer, Mallett and midseason pickups T.J. Yates and Brandon Weeden.

Allen, 26, is a versatile offensive lineman who started at left guard and right tackle during his four seasons with the Chiefs. He also was one of their better linemen during that time.

A 2012 second-round draft pick out of Illinois, Allen started 13 games for the Chiefs as a rookie. When healthy, he has been in the lineup ever since.

Injuries, however, have been a problem for Allen over the past two seasons. He missed all but the season-opener in 2014 because of an elbow injury and then missed four games last season because of knee and ankle problems.

Golden State is safe at the top Golden State is safe at the top NEXT VIDEO

April Fools' Day came about 25 days early in the NBA, when the Los Angeles Lakers sprung an upset so big Sunday afternoon that anyone who wasn't watching it live surely presumed they were being hoaxed when they heard the score.

The Golden State Warriors, however, have survived the trauma of their stunning 112-95 defeat to the first Lakers team of all time sporting a winning percentage that at the time was below the Mendoza line by retaining the top spot in ESPN.com's weekly NBA Power Rankings.

Let's face it: One loss -- even if it should have counted for two or three -- can't knock Golden State off its perch when the 55-6 Dubs are still ahead of Chicago's 1995-96 pace of 54-7 at the same juncture.

Even better news for Golden State: San Antonio has the league's toughest remaining schedule, so the Spurs' mere 212-game deficit in the race for the West's top seed probably isn't as enticing as it looks. The Spurs did just become merely the third team in history to win their first 30 home games of the season, but 16 of San Antonio's 20 remaining games will come against teams over. .500 ... with a whopping three each against Golden State and Oklahoma City.

So I'd hold off on writing off the Warriors after one (really, really) bad day.

espn.com,,"Scouting in California: Notes on Reggie Lawson, Ryan Boldt, others","['Keith Law', 'Eric Longenhagen']","Insider

Some notes from three days spent in southern California seeing players and fighting traffic

 Right-hander Reggie Lawson of Victor Valley High School in Victorville, California, was a favorite of many scouts last summer thanks to his loose arm and easy delivery, as well as a fastball up to 95 mph in short stints. On Saturday morning, in a game moved up four hours to avoid some rain that never arrived, Lawson showed the loose arm and great projection, but the delivery has gone a bit backward and will need to be cleaned up.

Lawson was mostly 88-92 mph on Saturday, touching 95-96 about three times over the course of his too-long seven innings, getting a lot of swings and misses on the pitch but also giving up too much hard contact because he had little deception and left the ball up frequently. His curveball has good rotation and two-plane break, ranging anywhere from 66-74 mph; at the upper end of the range, it's a good pitch, potentially plus, but a 66 mph curveball is cute and not very effective regardless of who's throwing it. He flashed a slider and changeup but barely threw either pitch, going with the curveball when he wanted a called strike.

Lawson's frame is projectable and he's very athletic, so it's a shock to see that his delivery has regressed since last summer.",[]

LAS VEGAS -- The fight game is a humbling one. Conor McGregor learned that at UFC 196.

McGregor, the once seemingly invincible Irishman destined to hold UFC titles in multiple weight classes, tapped to a rear-naked choke applied by Nate Diaz on Saturday night. The finish came at 4:12 of the second round in a welterweight bout McGregor appeared to be in control of early.

Diaz (19-10), who took the fight on 11 days' notice after McGregor's original opponent, Rafael dos Anjos, withdrew because of a broken foot, reacted as only Diaz could.

""I'm not surprised, m-----f-----,"" Diaz said. ""There's a new king in this ... now.""

McGregor (19-3), whose 15-fight winning streak was snapped, remains the UFC featherweight champion despite the loss. The bout was contested at 170 pounds because Diaz had virtually no time to cut weight. Originally, McGregor was attempting to move to the 155-pound division to challenge dos Anjos for the lightweight title.

McGregor blamed the loss, his first since 2010, on inefficiency. All three of his professional losses have come via submission.

""I took the chance in going up to 170,"" McGregor said. ""I was inefficient with my energy. I'm humbled in victory and defeat. He took the fight on short notice and done the job. He was efficient. I was not. These things happen. I'll learn, and I'll grow. I'll face it like a man.""

McGregor detailed the pitfalls he encountered against a heavier and taller opponent than he is accustomed to fighting.

""I think I needed to be a little more select, a little more efficient with my energy,"" McGregor told ESPN. ""I needed to recognize that a bigger man -- you must put the shots together a little bit more to stop a bigger man.""

Conor McGregor's loss to Nate Diaz on Saturday night snapped a 15-fight winning streak. All three of his losses have come by submission. ""These things happen,"" he said. ""I'll learn, and I'll grow. I'll face it like a man."" Ed Mulholland for ESPN

McGregor had his way with Diaz in the opening round. His overhand left connected frequently with the right side of Diaz's face. Diaz was cut almost immediately and was bleeding badly over his right eye for the majority of the bout. But McGregor, who has famously boasted that no one can take his left hand, couldn't put down Diaz, who never appeared hurt.

Nevertheless, McGregor was mostly in control. Even when Diaz scored a takedown late in the first round, McGregor immediately swept him and finished in top position.

The next round had a similar feel, as McGregor landed one left hand after another. Perhaps he grew too comfortable doing so. A couple of minutes in, Diaz wobbled him with a straight left. Diaz threw his hands up and smiled after the punch landed. Once McGregor's legs buckled, Diaz immediately started to close in on him.

McGregor never went down, but Diaz pushed him to the fence and landed a series of left hands. McGregor eventually managed to push off and began throwing back, but Diaz, with his two-inch reach advantage, expertly stepped in and out of McGregor's attempts to hurt him and landed another hard jab and then a straight left hand that forced McGregor to shoot for a takedown.

Diaz immediately countered with a guillotine, flipped McGregor over and moved into full mount. McGregor was forced to turn and give up his back, which led to the rear-naked choke and tapout. It is the ninth submission win of Diaz's UFC career, second most in the promotion's history. He trails only Royce Gracie, who has 10.

According to Fightmetric, Diaz outlanded McGregor in total strikes, 77 to 61.

McGregor indicated he would likely still compete at UFC 200 on July 9 in Las Vegas, as originally planned. He said he hasn't given up on fighting for the 155-pound or even 170-pound championship down the line but will probably move back to the 145-pound division for his next fight and defend the belt he won in December in a 13-second knockout over Jose Aldo.

Asked who he felt was more deserving of a shot between Frankie Edgar and Aldo, McGregor said he would let the fans decide.

""It's hard not to give Aldo another shot. He was 10 years undefeated,"" McGregor said. ""But then again, he pulls out a lot. He doesn't show up. Frankie at least gets in there and competes.

""I don't know. I'll keep my ear to the ground and see who the fans want to see the most, what are the fans interested in. Then I'll sit and wait patiently for the lightweight belt to be contested and I'll make my way back up.""",[]

espn.com,,"Junior featherweight and featherweight, two divisions full of possibilities","['Dan Rafael', 'Pa Sport', 'Nigel Collins']","When the short, bald-headed guy climbed off the canvas after being knocked down for the second time in the very first round, he already knew what he was going to do when the referee finished the 8-count and wiped off his gloves. He was going to throw himself at his tormentor and fight as hard as he could for as long as he could. To hell with the consequences.

It's difficult to know what comes over a man at a moment like that, when he chooses to sacrifice himself with Charge-of-the-Light Brigade abandon, rather than submit to surrender's sweet embrace.

But that's exactly what Kiko Martinez did last Saturday in Anaheim, California, an act that transformed what should have been a routine win for house-fighter Leo Santa Cruz into an exhilarating, albeit brief, firefight.

In fewer than five rounds, featherweights Santa Cruz and Martinez generated more white-knuckle drama than the rest of the weekend's fisticuffs combined. Santa Cruz could have played it safe and boxed Martinez from the outside, and he knew it. But instead he, too, opted to stand and fight.

Punch stats Punches Santa Cruz Martinez Landed 234 74 Thrown 570 468 Percent 41% 16% -- Courtesy of CompuBox

What else could you expect from a fighter born in Michoacan de Ocampo, where his Purepecha ancestors repelled Aztec invaders in the 15th century? And whose cowboy hat-wearing father began showing him videos of Julio Cesar Chavez when he was barely out of diapers.

Brawling is in Santa Cruz's blood.

""I got carried away. I wanted to go toe-to-toe,"" said a grinning Santa Cruz by way of an excuse. ""I wanted to please the fans, to make it a war.""

There's almost always a transient moment in a memorable fight when something happens to lift it above the commonplace. That instant came Saturday when the B-side boxer Martinez, who earned a reported $150,000 to Santa Cruz's $1 million, went for broke.

Striving to satisfy the blood lust of the howling mob (you know, the paying customers) is not a universal trait among fighters. But the truth is that quite a lot of them enjoy a dustup just as much as the fans. Martinez has always been a puncher and decided to go out doing what he does best, and Santa Cruz was happy to oblige.

When referee Raul Caiz Sr. saved a by-then helpless Martinez from additional abuse with more than a minute to go in the fifth round, the grizzled Spaniard was still on his feet.

Guillermo Rigondeaux, arguably the best fighter currently campaigning in the 122-126-pound range, looks down his nose at such recklessness. He relies on sublime boxing skills to thwart opponents with as little fuss as possible. Taking unnecessary risks in search of greater glory is the last thing on his mind, a pragmatic approach that has not particularly endeared him to the masses.

Make no mistake, there is a cadre of appreciative fans who value Rigo's mastery and are indignant that he hasn't received the recognition they feel he deserves. But there's no way of getting around the fact that he is a marketing and matchmaking nightmare -- kind of a virtuoso outlier who can't quite find his place.

In the end it comes down to a simple choice: Do boxing consumers want technical perfection or the excitement only mutual vulnerability provides?

Sometimes, of course, the decision is easier to make than at others. How many of you are even remotely psyched about Rigondeaux's scheduled rendezvous with one James ""Jazza"" Dickens on March 12 in Liverpool?

It reminds me of the time I saw future Hall of Famer Bob Foster defend the light heavyweight championship against Joe Palooka-lookalike Tommy Hicks at the Scranton CYC. No TV!

Genius on the chitlin' circuit.

But what are you going to do? Life isn't fair, and we can't expect boxing to be any different.

Happily, the abundance of talent currently residing in the 122 and 126-pound classes is bountiful enough that Rigondeaux's involvement is not de rigueur.

Junior featherweight titlist Carl Frampton, right, unified belts with a victory over Scott Quigg on Feb. 27. Alex Livesey/Getty Images

Earlier last Saturday, roughly 5,300 miles to the east of Anaheim, more than 20,000 delirious fans filled the Manchester Arena to watch the highly-anticipated showdown between Northern Ireland's Carl Frampton and England's Scott Quigg, two leading lights of the renaissance U.K. boxing is currently enjoying. The charged atmosphere and earsplitting din inside the arena were reminiscent of past nights, when Ricky Hatton graced the same venue.

The match was more than a regional rivalry. Going in, Frampton and Quigg were ranked No. 2 and No. 4 junior featherweights, respectively, by ESPN.com. Moreover, they were unifying two alphabet titles and Showtime Extreme thought enough of the fight to broadcast it live in the U.S.

Much was expected. Maybe too much.

For the first six rounds the fight was uncomfortably reminiscent of the Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao charade. Frampton did just enough to win every round, while Quigg did next to nothing.

We would later learn that Quigg's jaw had been broken by a uppercut in the fourth, which would certainly explain his reticence to engage. Why he barely threw a punch prior to that is harder to justify.

Equally baffling was Quigg's late charge, which started in the seventh and peaked in the 11th when his body shots had Frampton hanging on and looking at his corner. But when the Irishman rallied to win the 12th, any hope Quigg may have harbored vanished at the sound of the final bell.

In the end, it was half of a good fight. Even Frampton -- who stayed unbeaten with a split decision that should have been unanimous -- failed to dazzle. He calls himself the ""Jackal,"" but resembled a scrappy terrier against Quigg, figuratively nipping at his heels instead of going for the jugular.

Even so, Frampton got the job done and sent his loyal fans back across the Irish Sea with a song in their hearts. And as far as his manager, Barry McGuigan, is concerned, there's no looking back.

""With the greatest respect for Scott Quigg that [rematch] is not an attractive fight for us,"" McGuigan told Ciaran Gallagher of the Irish Examiner. ""We need to step up to the next level and I think Santa Cruz is a real possibility. We're not interested in Rigondeaux. He can't draw 500 Cubans in Miami. This is a business. Don't get me wrong, he's fabulous but he's awkward and negative. The money-fight is Santa Cruz. It would be breathtaking.""

Guillermo Rogondeaux's style makes hi very successful, but fight fans are asking for more action. Al Bello/Getty Images

You can't argue with McGuigan's reasoning. Santa Cruz-Frampton would be a money-spinner on either side of the Atlantic and, even more importantly, it would in all likelihood turn into the thriller McGuigan predicts.

The appealing matchups don't end with Frampton and Santa Cruz. Hugo Ruiz, who blew out Julio Ceja on the Santa Cruz-Martinez undercard, has also punched his way into serious contention. He regained the 122-pound belt he lost last August, when Ceja came of the floor to stop him on the Santa Cruz-Abner Mares card. This time was different.

The right hand that finishes Ceja in the rematch was a beaut, flush on the chin over top of a lazy left. Ceja went down hard, twisting his right ankle as he fell. It was all over by the 0:51 mark of the opening round, a stunning result that left the victor battling to control his emotions.

Despite his defensive lapses, Ruiz would be a handful for anybody in or around the featherweight division. He's 5'9.5"" with a 69.5"" reach, giving him an advantage over most men his weight. Combined with a puncher's temperament and the pop to back it up, the latest danger-man from the fertile breeding ground of Los Mochis, Sinaloa, is not to be underestimated.

Lee Selby, Andres Cuellar and Mares are also in the mix, but political gridlock remains a crippling impediment to many mouthwatering matchups. Even so, every now and then there's a sign of willingness to forge at least a temporary truce.

Bob Arum, who promotes featherweight Vasyl Lomachenko, Nonito Donaire and Eugeny Gradovich, says he's willing to work with Al Haymon to make a match between junior welterweights Terence Crawford and Adrien Broner. It's a long shot, but if Uncle Bob's olive branch bears fruit, who knows where else it could sprout?

It wasn't that long ago that Pacquiao, Marco Antonio Barrera, Erik Morales and Juan Manuel Marquez engaged one another in a magnificent series of featherweight wars. It was a great time for boxing, and there's no sane reason something similar couldn't happen again.

Granted it would not be on the same exalted level, but there are certainly more than enough good fighters in and around the featherweight division to get things rolling.

Last Saturday's action brought the possibilities into sharper focus so all we need now is a modicum of cooperation, a little luck and fighters who behave the way they should. The way Martinez did last Saturday when he gave his all in losing cause.

It's not always the winner who lights the fuse. It's the ensuing explosion that counts.",[]

espn.com,,Did Conor McGregor make a mistake fighting at 170 pounds?,['Brett Okamoto'],"Each week, ESPN.com writer and MMA Live Extra analyst Brett Okamoto provides his take on the hottest topics in the world of mixed martial arts.

This week, Okamoto squares off with UFC welterweight Carlos Condit to debate the latest news and trends. Condit (30-9), 31, a former welterweight champion, hasn't fought since a controversial decision loss to champion Robbie Lawler in January.

1. Did Conor McGregor make a mistake in agreeing to the last-minute switch of Nate Diaz and 170 pounds?

UFC featherweight champion Conor McGregor was defeated by Nate Diaz, top, in a welterweight bout at UFC 196. Ed Mulholland for ESPN

Condit: He took a risk, that's for sure. Came up short, it happens. I feel like Nick and Nate Diaz are difficult guys to fight on short notice. It takes a good amount of preparation and game planning to beat those guys. I thought Conor's skills looked super sharp. He went out there and landed a lot of great punches. Nate is super tough and has a great chin. A lot of guys have made the mistake of going out and trying to finish him, knock him out with one punch. You could see Conor got visibly fatigued, even in the first round. It seemed like Nate can just overwhelm you. He's got the cardio and a funky style. I think the range and distancing was a huge factor. Conor threw his signature left hand a bunch of times. He connected quite a few times but came up short by a couple inches on others.

Okamoto: Yeah, I'll agree with Condit's wording of it -- it was a risk. He's arguably the biggest star in the entire sport right now, and he agreed to fight a completely different opponent at a completely different weight on 11 days' notice. And as I've said before, this wasn't a ""welterweight bout,"" in that he didn't fight a pure welterweight. Even though Diaz has fought at 170 pounds before, he's a lightweight. But even though he didn't fight a legitimate welterweight, McGreogor did move up two weight classes. The entire experience of not cutting weight during fight week and carrying that weight differently was all new to him. You don't see guys experiment with those kinds of changes when so much is on the line. McGregor took a huge risk, but I can't call it a mistake. It's that ""anybody, anywhere, anytime"" mentality that has made him so popular.

2. Who should McGregor defend his 145-pound championship against: Jose Aldo or Frankie Edgar?

Condit: I think Edgar deserves the shot, for sure. Edgar has been phenomenal as of late. He knocked out Chad Mendes, who has been a perennial contender. Edgar has been a champion before. He's championship caliber. He just deserves it.

Okamoto: Edgar. I believe, when it's said and done, it will be Aldo. And I'm not even 100 percent against that, but the most-deserving is Edgar. Yes, Aldo was a featherweight champion for six years and that definitely, definitely counts for something. But since 2013, Aldo's record is 4-1, compared to Edgar's 5-1. Edgar has three finishes during that time, compared to Aldo's one. Even though Aldo beat Edgar in early 2013, you can make the case Edgar has been more impressive in the time since. He's coming off a first-round knockout over Mendes. He's a former lightweight champion. Aldo just fought McGregor less than three months and was knocked out in 13 seconds. And he was offered a chance to fight McGregor at UFC 196 on short notice and didn't take it. I'm not trying to dismiss anything about Aldo, he's one of the most dominant champions in UFC history, but if you take everything together here -- Edgar is the more deserving.

3. After last weekend, is the next UFC female bantamweight championship matchup to make Miesha Tate vs. Ronda Rousey?

Condit: I don't know. I'm disappointed Holly [Holm], who is one of my teammates, lost. I would have loved to see her defend the title successfully and then fight Ronda in a rematch. It didn't go that way. I think Rousey vs. Tate, yeah. I don't see why not. Off the top of my head, I can't really think of anybody who is super deserving of a shot other than Ronda. Have Holly fight one of the other contenders, maybe someone like Bethe Correia.

Okamoto: I suppose it is. Although, if Rousey still isn't due back until October or November, I don't see anything wrong with running back Tate vs. Holm at UFC 200. The fight wasn't a barnburner in terms of non-stop action, but it was tense in that you knew Holm couldn't afford to let it go to the ground -- and Tate couldn't afford to not get it to the ground. It's a fun stylistic matchup and had time ran out on Tate and she hadn't gotten a finish in the final round, it likely would have ended in a draw. The UFC wants the Holm vs. Rousey rematch, with a belt on the line, because that's the sellable fight. They could still end up getting that, if Holm were to come back and beat Tate. I don't mind seeing a female bantamweight division that doesn't bend to the schedule of one contender -- I guess that's my main point here. If Rousey isn't ready, then go with the two women who are. I think we saw at UFC 196 that there can still be drama and interest in a 135-pound female fight without Rousey. But of course, I understand the reasons for the UFC keeping Rousey in mind.

4. UFC 196 featured great fights, but two stars (McGregor and Holm) lost. Was it a good or bad night for the sport?

Condit: I think it was a good night for the sport, maybe a bad night in the business sense for the promotion. I don't think Conor loses much. He's still a catalyzing figure in the sport. People are going to come out and watch him fight. Yeah he lost, but he fought his ass off and put on a hell of a show. I would say the rematch between Holm and Rousey loses a little. It would have been best case scenario to have Holly fight Ronda while still holding the belt but we'll see what the future holds. I think the interest can be built back up in that. I would hope a night like that would bring fans back because it showed the unpredictability of the sport. Conor was running through people, he just ran though Aldo, and he fought a guy who is maybe considered a gatekeeper and got finished. You never know in this sport.

Okamoto: This was a good night for the sport. The fights were great, upsets always make for a strong live sports experience if you ask me. Now, if McGregor goes back to 145 and loses his title ... if Holm comes back and fights another contender like Amanda Nunes and loses as well ... then we might be looking back at UFC 196 as the start of a bad run for the UFC's stars, which in turn is a bad run for the UFC itself. Stars drive this vehicle, we all know that. Same goes with Rousey. Was her loss at UFC 193 a bad night for the sport? No, I don't think it was. It's one of the most historic moments in the sport's history. But if she never comes back the same, is it bad for general interest in MMA right now? Obviously, yes. So, I guess we'll see. But UFC 196 was exciting and it's got people talking and that ain't bad.

5. UFC 200 looms in July, but there are four months of fights on the schedule before then. What is the best fight currently scheduled between now and then?

The welterweight fight between Stephen Thompson and Rory MacDonald will be one to watch. Rod Mar for ESPN

Condit: I would say Stephen ""Wonderboy"" Thompson vs. Rory MacDonald (UFC Fight Night on June 18). MacDonald is a super polished, very technical mixed martial arts fighter in a traditional sense. He's got great boxing, kickboxing, wrestling, good jiu-jitsu. Wonderboy comes from a traditional martial arts background (karate) that isn't traditionally used in MMA, if that makes sense. And that can give people a lot of problems. When Thompson came into the UFC he had issues, guys were taking him down and he wasn't using his range very well. Now that he seems to have those things dialed in, he's able to use that devastating striking ability. Both of those guys are elite strikers but with very different styles. That will make for an exciting fight.

Okamoto: I believe it's the five-round UFC lightweight fight between Khabib Nurmagomedov vs. Tony Ferguson on April 16. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I think there's a chance the party's over at 155 pounds when a healthy Nurmagomedov returns. He's never lost and he's got a win over the current champion, Rafael dos Anjos. If Nurmagomedov comes back and starts smoking this entire division, I will not be surprised. His first fight back though, is coming against an opponent I've had pegged for quite some time as a dark horse in this division. Ferguson hits harder than most 155 pounders, his cardio and strength training seems to be second-to-none, he has no obvious holes to his game. He also seems to have the mental component down, walks into fights completely confident. This matchup will be a dog fight. Trust me.",[]

espn.com,,Fans and League of Legends,"['James Obscurica', 'James Bates', 'Alan Nahaz', 'Obscurica Chen', 'Stephen Chiu', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Timothy Lee', 'Tyler Fionn', 'Arash Markazi', 'Chase Geddes']","It's 8 a.m. Sunday and Skyler Walkowski is standing in front of a line of about 20 fans outside LCS Arena, three miles from the iconic Santa Monica Pier. The doors don't actually open until 11 a.m.; by then, the line behind him will swell to 400 fans who will pack the bleachers of a soundstage that serves as home of America's fastest-growing sport.

Walkowski, 21, traveled to Los Angeles for the weekend from Hatley, Wisconsin, a town of only 600, about 80 miles northwest of Green Bay. But Walkowski didn't leave snow in Wisconsin for the beaches of Southern California. He traveled more than 2,000 miles to watch the North American League of Legends Championship Series (NA LCS). The NA LCS' nine-week spring season and two playoff rounds are held in the LCS Arena in Santa Monica. Ten teams play twice each weekend in round-robin tournament play beginning in January, culminating with a road trip in April for the finals (this year, the spring finals are in Las Vegas). The teams all play in Los Angeles (Berlin for the European counterpart), but they reach a global audience of hundreds of thousands with games streamed every week. When the League of Legends Season 3 World Championship was held at Staples Center in Los Angeles in 2013, it sold out within minutes and had 32 million unique viewers.

Unlike traditional sports in which geography often dictates fan bases, esports teams and players are not defined by a city or a region. Instead, fans align themselves with players and teams for reasons that have little to do with where they live or grew up.

""This is my first time here in person, but I've been watching every week for the past two years,"" Walkowski said. ""My team is Cloud9, and one of the things that drew me to them was a couple of years ago at the world championships, their shot caller, Hai, did like this Metal Gear Solid mission on Zed and tried to sneak around the enemy team. I thought that was hilarious. I started watching them from there and started to love them.""

Joshua ""Jatt"" Leesman went from player to analyst for the LCS. Riot Games

That might not make much sense to non-gamers, but it's essentially like falling in love with LeBron James because of his ability to take control of a game and becoming a Cleveland Cavaliers fan in the process. Much like fans who cheer for Kevin Durant or Russell Westbrook without ever stepping foot in Oklahoma City, fandom in esports isn't decided by location but rather personal preferences. Just like Westbrook's aggressiveness on the court attracts fans, so does Hai's aggressiveness on the Field of Justice.

""Early on, [esports] was almost completely player focused, where the top streamers would have all the fans and whatever team they were on, people would follow those players,"" said Josh ""Jatt"" Leesman, 28, a retired player and current game analyst for the LCS. ""We have seen a bit of an evolution in that TSM and CLG are the two oldest esports franchises in North American League of Legends, and even though their players are 100 percent different than they were four years ago, you still have consistent TSM and CLG fans.""

So how do fans pick teams and players in a sport with no real geographical ties or identifiers? Much like traditional sports, the answer is different for every fan depending on the player or team.

Born and reared in South Korea, 18-year-old Heo ""Huni"" Seung-hoon is the top laner for the nearly unstoppable Immortals, but most of his fans are in Europe and North America, where he has played the past two years.

""I was not a player in [the League Championship Series], so I don't have as many fans in Korea as I do in Europe and in the States,"" Huni said. ""I played in EU LCS and now I play in NA LCS, so I have more fans here. ... I probably still have more fans in Europe still."" Huni played on Fnatic last year in the EU LCS and became a fan favorite, not only for his style of play but his ability to make his teammates and fans laugh during events, which inspired more than a few YouTube tribute videos.

Heo ""Huni"" Seung-hoon (right of fan) and his team Immortals meet and greet fans outside in the sunny Santa Monica weather after their match. Riot Games

Sren ""Bjergsen"" Bjerg, the 20-year-old mid-laner for Team SoloMid, is Danish and has a massive following in Denmark after playing for the Copenhagen Wolves, as well as for teams in Amsterdam, Paris and Sweden.

""My fans are definitely very global,"" Bjergsen said. ""I'm from Denmark, but I played in Europe first before I moved to North America. So I grew a fan base in Europe before moving to America, which helps. It's nice that every time we go internationally there are fans who know my name, even when we go to Asian countries like Taiwan and Korea. That always surprises me.""

It has generally been easier for esports fans to follow players as opposed to teams simply because, specifically in League of Legends, the league and teams haven't been around that long; teams from four years ago have either disbanded or rebranded, with some not even lasting a calendar year. Players also routinely change teams year to year, making it hard for some teams to build stable fan bases around familiar players. Building stable franchises with the ability to keep players long term is the next step for a league that now has Echo Fox team owner Rick Fox, who won three NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers, and could be adding Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban as well.

""Fans are first and foremost fans of the game,"" Fox said. ""I was a fan of CLG because they were the underdog team. They also had a player, Aphromoo, who my son and I were huge fans of. ... It's still a very player-centric league. Like in the NBA, you root for a player you identify with. Why does someone like Kobe instead of LeBron? You like a player because you like the way they play, what they've done and what they stand for, and then you root for the team the player is attached to and you become a fan of the team because you get to know the other players.""

Team SoloMid (TSM) is one of the signature franchises of the young NA LCS, winning three of six league championships and finishing second three times. Cloud9 (C9), founded by former TSM manager Jack Etienne, has won two championships and finished second twice. The success and longevity of those teams, along with Counter Gaming Logic (CLG), have made them the most popular teams in NA LCS. Fans at the LCS Arena routinely chant ""T-S-M!"" during games and hold up signs for their favorite players. On Sunday, there were a dozen signs in the crowd wishing Bjergsen a happy birthday as he turned 20.

""In terms of branding, being on TSM was everything to me,"" Bjergsen said. ""I went from a player people kind of thought was good, but no one knew anything about me. I hadn't done many interviews, and then I came onto TSM, and TSM was known for doing a lot of content for their fans, so that's kind of how I got myself out there and for everyone to know me through TSM.""

While traditional sports teams and players have a geographical home base where their popularity initially grew from, esports players and teams must cultivate fandom in other ways. Tournaments and fan interactions at events are important, but connections are often made long before that, when fans interact with players who stream themselves playing games for hours and interacting with fans in the process. Top players in NA LCS have channels on Twitch, one of the five most trafficked websites in the United States, and are streaming constantly. Bjergsen, for example, has more than 1 million Twitch followers -- his channel has had about 70 million views.

""It's very personal,"" Leesman said. ""When they're streaming, they're on-camera, they're interacting with the chat, you're getting to watch everything they do when they're practicing. It would be analogous to watching Kobe Bryant go through pick-up games and he's talking to fans the whole time. You're never going to see that. You feel a connection to the players and you learn a lot from the player because you're seeing everything that they're doing. ...That's the way players get a really big following.""

It's also how teams grow their followings, too. All teams have their players interact with fans in person and online. Every team takes time to take pictures and sign autographs for fans after every game, and players will often broadcast live streams of themselves playing League of Legends, sometimes with their competitors from the LCS, and chatting with fans. It's during these candid moments that fans also find themselves choosing the player or team they want to root for.

""One of the biggest differences between traditional sports and esports is the access to the pros,"" Etienne said. ""You don't get to hang out with the pros after a baseball game or basketball game. Here you get to spend a good half-hour to an hour with them after the events and then through social media, Twitch and reddit, [and] they get a ton more access.

""For example, [our AD carry] Sneaky played really well today. He'll go home, eat some food and hop on Twitch, and he'll stream for eight hours and interact with the fans. He's talking back and forth with them actively. He's streaming almost every day. The increased fan interaction develops a much tighter relationship with esports pros and their fans than you would see with traditional sports and their fans.""

It's a relationship, much like the teams in the NA LCS, which is growing and becoming more stable over time. Except the relationship knows no boundaries; it's a global experience and community.",[]

espn.com,,Team Liquid's Dardoch talks NA LCS junglers,"['Timothy Lee', 'Tyler Fionn', 'Tomi Lurppis', 'James Bates', 'Tim Lee']","In 2015, the weakest position in the North American LCS was in the jungle. While Lee ""Rush"" Yoon-jae won the regular-season MVP for the summer split, a majority of the jungler class was underwhelming in their roles. The role has seen an upgrade as the calendar turned, with the arrival of Worlds semifinalist, Kim ""Reignover"" Yeu-jin, of Fnatic, joining the league-leading Immortals (13-1) and a crop of rookies coming up from the minor leagues.

The supernova of those rookie junglers has been Joshua ""Dardoch"" Hartnett, the starting jungler for Team Liquid (7-7). After bouncing between minor league teams and Team Liquid's Academy squad, the straightforward 17-year-old has made the most of his call-up to the majors. A playmaking, dynamic-style of player, Dardoch has slid in beautifully alongside Liquid's ace AD carry and former world champion, Chae ""Piglet"" Gwang-jin.

Following his team's victory over a team it's chasing in the standings, Team SoloMid (8-6), I was able to talk to Liquid's electric newcomer.

""How was the game today?"" I asked.

""We played TSM, and it was pretty one-sided,"" he answered, blunt and direct. ""I think their shot-calling is a bit off. They aren't at the right places at the right time, and their draft was pretty bad today.""

TSM's jungler, Dennis ""Svenskeren"" Johnsen, entered the scene as one of the new jungle signings that was supposed to turn around the position in the NA LCS. The ace player of the regular season winning SK Gaming back in spring 2015, Svenskeren was expected to make the rebuilt TSM a faster, better early game-focused group. Dardoch, though, thinks his play so far has been underwhelming. Editor's Picks CLG's Darshan reflects on ending Immortals' perfect NA LCS split After 12 consecutive wins to open the NA LCS spring split, Immortals finally fell at the hands of Counter Logic Gaming. Darshan reflects on that win, and looks forward at CLG's prospects.

""I don't think he's necessarily super good like he was before,"" Dardoch said, when asked what he thought how his opponent has done in his debut season in North America. ""I'm not sure if he degraded in skill or if others got better, because I wasn't playing at LCS-level back then. But to me, he's pretty good. I think he's a little below me in skill. Mechanically, I'm better than him for sure, but I think he has experience over me.""

One player Dardoch believes is better than himself is the reigning league MVP and Cloud9's jungler, Rush. The two played in back-to-back games on Sunday with Lee Sin, with Rush first busting out an amazing performance that ended in a losing effort against Counter Logic Gaming (10-4). Dardoch went into the next game and put on an equally dazzling show on a champion that's quickly becoming synonymous with both aggressive junglers.

TL, even though it's in the thick of things for a top-four playoff spot, is still a team built for the future. Its oldest player, Piglet, is only 22, and no one else on the team is over 20. The three rookies who have made their debut this split -- Dardoch, Samson ""Lourlo"" Jackson and Matthew ""Matt"" Elento -- are all 18 years old or younger. While Liquid could surprise people in a run for the championship come LCS's trip to Las Vegas for the finals, this team's ceiling realistically might not even be until 2017 rolls around.

""In terms of age, we're definitely built for the future,"" he said. ""But we're all hard-working individuals, so we progress way faster than other teams.""

The last topic broached with TL's jungler was the other jungler rookies who are currently trying to keep up with him for rookie of the split honors: Anthony ""Hard"" Barkhovtsev from Echo Fox (5-9); Galen ""Moon"" Holgate from NRG Esports (7-7); and Dignitas' (4-10) Thomas ""Kirei"" Yuen.

""I don't know much about Kirei,"" he said. ""I just know him as the [European] one-trick Elise, more or less. I don't think too highly of him, but I definitely play with respect especially when he gets champions like Kindred or Elise.""

NRG's jungler scored higher points on Dardoch's evaluation. ""I thought Moon was really good because I played him a lot in Challenger series. I'm not sure what happened to him, but I still think he's a really good player. [I] don't think he's showing as good as he really is on the stage.""

He also rated Hard highly. ""I think Hard is really good. He hasn't had an opportunity to show how good he is because [Echo Fox] hadn't been playing with their main roster.""

Dardoch will continue to lead the rookie jungler quartet in two weeks when Liquid tries to lock up a playoff spot against Counter Logic Gaming and Moon's NRG Esports.",[]
espn.com,,Notes: 2nd purse bid for Pedraza-Smith on tap,['Dan Rafael'],"A few notes from around the boxing world:

In late December, the purse bid for the mandatory fight between junior lightweight titleholder Jose Pedraza (21-0, 12 KOs), of Puerto Rico, and Englands Stephen Smith (23-1, 13 KOs) was called off because Pedraza promoter Lou DiBella and Smith promoter Eddie Hearn informed the IBF that they made a deal and the fight would take place in late March in the United States. However, the fight was not officially scheduled by the IBFs deadline to have contracts returned. So another purse bid was ordered and it is scheduled for Thursday. Pedraza won the vacant belt by one-sided decision against Andrey Klimov in June and retained the belt by split decision against Edner Cherry on Oct. 3. Smith achieved mandatory status with a sixth-round knockout of Devis Boschiero in their title eliminator on Sept. 19.

Former super middleweight titleholder Robert Stieglitz (48-5-1, 28 KOs), best known for his entertaining four-fight series of 168-pound world-title bouts against Arthur Abraham (which Abraham won 3-1), continues his comeback at light heavyweight on Saturday in Home Monitoring Arena in Pilsen, Czech Republic. Stieglitz got knocked out in the sixth round of the fourth fight against Abraham in last July and returned as a light heavyweight for a second-round knockout win over Robert Rosenberg in October. Stieglitz has decided to remain in the new weight class and will take on Argentinas Ricardo Marcelo Ramallo (20-8-1, 15 KOs). New weight class, same goal, Stieglitz said at this weeks final news conference. I want to become world champion again.

espn.com,,"YellOwStaR talks IEM, mithy and Mata","['James Obscurica', 'Tomi Lurppis', 'James Bates', 'Stephen Chiu', 'Tim Lee', 'Tyler Fionn', 'Chase Geddes', 'Timothy Lee']","""I'm someone who is always looking for improvement,"" said Team SoloMid's in-game leader, Bora ""YellOwStaR"" Kim, last weekend at the North American League Championship Series. ""I'm always reflecting on what I'm doing wrong or what I'm doing right. And if I can't find out what I'm doing wrong, I'll ask people around me what I can change. Whether in-game or outside of the game, what do you guys think I can do better for us to be [stronger]?""

As the primary shot caller for TSM, YellOwStaR has been in a constant process of adapting this split. First, he had to learn how to play with four new players on a squad that never played together before. After that, he was thrown into the bottom lane with Yiliang ""Doublelift"" Peng, putting him under the spotlight to perform as one of the world's best bottom lanes right from the get-go. More recently, the team dropped their head coach after not grabbing the results they wanted in the regular, and that's made the legendary western support change-up his approach once again.

TSM, on the surface, is experiencing a good season. With a roster of five that's never played together before and a coaching change in the middle of the season, the team is 8-6 and firmly in a playoff spot. For a majority of squads that drastically changed lineups in the offseason, this wouldn't be alarming. It takes time for a championship team, regardless of the team's individual talent, to come together and learn how to win as a unit.

But SoloMid isn't like a majority of teams. The offseason moves in the winter were made to make it not simply one of the best teams in North American history, but the best team in NA LCS history. Immortals, who are currently 13-1 and had a 12-game win streak to start the season, are where TSM believe they should be. Stumbling into the playoffs isn't an option for the experience-laden squad with a starting five filled with all-stars.

""We've definitely improved way more,"" said YellOwStaR on the subject of his bottom lane duo with Doublelift. ""I felt like before he was a bit scared of me not making the right choice for him, so I know now how he wants to play. We're more on the same page, so we're going to be way more coordinated, and I can feel that he's going to trust me more in how we're going to play the laning-phase and teamfights.""

IEM Katowice will be the next stop for the six-time NA LCS grand finalists, and they're no stranger to Poland. TSM actually enter the tournament as returning champions from last year, as they surprised the world by taking home the championship in a tournament filled with surprises. The heavy favorites to win it all last year, the KOO Tigers, flatlined in the semifinals against China's Team WE, and the resourceful TSM were able to fly past the underdog LPL team in the grand finals to hoist the IEM chalice.

This time, similarly to 2015, they enter with questions abound. Last year it was all about how they could vary up their stagnant, one-trick pony play style of cruising into the late-game until their ace, Sren ""Bjergsen"" Bjerg, took over and won the game. This time around, Bjergsen and TSM have weapons around him where that issue won't be an issue. The hurdle SoloMid will have to clear is the exact opposite from last year -- how can they work together to make sure all the firepower is used correctly? The TSM of 2015 weren't the greatest team when it came to having a wide array of strategies, but they knew how to play together. They only played through Bjergsen's strengths, yet it worked at IEM last year due to how well the five of them understood what to do at every point in the game. This year, they have the pieces to play around four different players as carries -- it's just a matter of finding that communication and trust.

""I'm really excited,"" he quickly replied when asked about heading to Poland for IEM. ""Even though we haven't shown the TSM people would like to see, I believe that playing against good teams at an international event, an actual tournament, will break our routine and [we'll] work really hard. [We] know we're going to face world-class players, and we all want to perform. As competitors, we just want to win. I think we can perform [well] over there.""

For YellOwStaR, IEM will give him the unique chance to compete possibly against three of the better supports in the world in his group.

In TSM's first game of the tournament, they'll take on the only minor league team at the event: EVER, the winners of Korea's KeSPA Cup and IEM Cologne. The team is led by their ace and tempo-master at the support role, the rookie phenom, Kim ""KeY"" Han-gi.

""[KeY] really impressed me when [EVER] played at IEM Cologne,"" he said about his first round opponent. ""I watched him play and he's really good. I'm usually not scared of facing players because that's not the right mindset going into a game, but I can never know how good he is until I play against him.""

Origen's support, Alfonso ""mithy"" Aguirre Rodriguez Riot Games

The next support in the group I asked him about is one he knows very well from his time in Europe. Alfonso ""mithy"" Aguirre Rodriguez clashed many times with YellOwStaR during last year's summer EU LCS split, where their two teams, Origen and Fnatic, played in the grand finals. After going through the whole season and semifinals undefeated, YellOwStaR and Fnatic finally dropped games to Origen in the finals, though eventually winning in the end 3-2. Both teams would then go on to make it to the semifinals of the World Championships in their home continent of Europe.

""I think he has a really good synergy with [Jesper ""Zven"" Svenningsen],"" he told me. ""Although this year they don't look as strong as last season, I have the same feeling about their bot-lane and my [ours]. I struggled a bit early because there were big changes to the pace of the game, and it was way faster. It's not the same meta as Worlds last year, so I can see we had the same problem adapting. But I'm pretty sure he's really good and has good work ethics.""

The final member of the 'Support Four' is also the most decorated. Cho ""Mata"" Se-hyeong is arguably the greatest support player in League of Legends history, with having won the Summoner's Cup in 2014 and winning the MVP award in the grand finals. While 2015 was a forgettable year for the South Korean, 2016 on a new team, Royal Never Give Up, has recharged the all-time great. Now on one of the leading teams in China, Mata is looking to add more gold to his already bustling trophy case.

""I used to really look up to him when he was on Samsung White,"" he said. ""I got to play against him [on Samsung White] and I was actually super scared even scrimming against them. Scrims were over after 15 minutes, and I was like, 'How was that possible?' 'How are they so good?' And then when they split up, I was happy that such a good team was not going to be together for the next year so other teams could compete. At the same time I felt sad, because they were so strong and dominant that it was frustrating playing against them. And every time I played him and [Gu ""imp"" Seung-bin], it was the first bottom lane that I was scared to play against.""

That is the type of player YellOwStaR is. Imp and Mata were one of the only players that ever made him feel fear when playing against, yet he felt bittersweet when they split. For him, playing against them showed mistakes in his style of play that he needed to fix. Those frustrating, agonizing, and painful 15 minute losses to Samsung White in scrimmages eventually helped him make it to the semifinals of Worlds with Fnatic in 2015.

The bigger mountain to climb for YellOwStaR, the better.

""TSM won Katowice last year, and I want this to happen again,"" he said. ""It would mean a lot to us. Even though we might be struggling for now, I think we're going uphill. I really expect our team to get out of group stage and actually qualify for the [semifinals]. That would give us a huge boost going forward into the [NA LCS] playoffs. Seeing how we've progressed, I expect a lot from us going into the tournament.""",[]

(2:57)

The Detroit Lions made their first big move in free agency, and it involved a potential replacement for Calvin Johnson.

The Lions are going to sign Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Marvin Jones, sources told ESPN's Dianna Russini.

The deal is for five years and $40 million and includes $27 million in the first three years, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter and media reports.

The agreement between Jones and the Lions comes less than 24 hours after Johnson announced he was retiring from the NFL after nine seasons in the league. Jones paid respect to Johnson on Tuesday on Twitter, saying he looked up to the now-former receiver.

Salute to my friend @calvinjohnsonjr Whom I look up to extremely, on a tremendous HOF career much Respect #Greatness pic.twitter.com/6oTklRZ3FU  Marvin Jones Jr (@MarvinJonesJr) March 8, 2016

Johnson's retirement left a major hole for the Lions at receiver, one they needed to fill between free agency and the draft. Jones will line up opposite Golden Tate in Detroit's wide receiver corps.

Editor's Picks Rothstein: Jones best option after Megatron Marvin Jones was the best possible option as the Lions transition from Calvin Johnson, especially after Chicago tagged Alshon Jeffery, keeping him off the market, Michael Rothstein writes.

Rothstein: With Megatron gone, pressure on Stafford Matthew Stafford proved successful when Calvin Johnson missed games with injuries, but now that pressure ramps up with Megatron gone for good, Michael Rothstein writes.

McManamon: Browns already feeling free-agent pain The Cleveland Browns already are feeling free-agent pain as a three-win team with plenty of needs created more needs by not keeping their own, Pat McManamon writes. 2 Related

In what's been considered a comparatively down year for free-agent receiver talent, Jones, who turns 26 on March 12, was regarded as one of the few real standouts. The expectation was that he could sign virtually anywhere he wanted to and that he would receive a large payday when he did.

As a fifth-round pick in 2012, Jones wasn't viewed as a true No. 1 or No. 2 pass-catcher when he entered the league. Before long, though, he became the perfect complement to Pro Bowler A.J. Green. In 2013, Jones caught a career-high 10 touchdown passes. Each of them came from inside the red zone. Green had 11 touchdown catches that year, making it only the second season in franchise history that the Bengals had two receivers with 10 or more touchdown receptions.

The best game of Jones' career was that season, too, when he caught four touchdown passes in a 49-9 rout of the New York Jets.

Although he can easily sprint past a corner on a deep go route, Jones' best attribute has long been his ability to catch passes in traffic, particularly on short fields from inside the 20. Because of that, Bengals coaches have long applauded his toughness.

Foot and ankle injuries caused him to miss all of his third season in 2014, but when Jones returned healthy in 2015, he produced. Targeted 98 times, he caught a career-high 65 passes for 816 yards and four touchdowns.

espn.com,,Mike Babcock begins grooming Toronto Maple Leafs' future,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Scott Burnside', 'John Buccigross', 'Paul Grant']","TORONTO -- Class is in session for a cherubic Toronto Maple Leafs roster representing the next phase of the team's rebuild.

Called up earlier this week, prospects William Nylander, Kasperi Kapanen, Nikita Soshnikov and Zach Hyman are getting their NHL feet wet now, which was always part of the plan post-trade deadline after the front office jettisoned a number of veterans.

The current NHL roster now has 10 players who played in the AHL at some point this season.

They're in the hands of professor Mike Babcock. The process of adjusting to NHL life can be overwhelming for these prospects at times. It's a steep learning curve.

""You got to learn to win, you got to learn to compete,"" the Leafs head coach said Thursday in explaining that apprenticeship. ""The guy across from you feeds his family. When you first arrive in the league, you don't have a wife and kids. Then you do have a wife and kids, and when you do have a wife and kids, you understand what responsibility is, so you want your job and you understand how you compete for your job. When you're a kid, you always think you're going to get the puck back. Once you get older, you know it's too hard to get it back, so you hang onto it all the time. There's lots to learn. They're works in progress. But it's got to be a night on every night.""

Babcock often compares NHL life to family life, the values and lessons of both worlds often crossing over in his views and beliefs.

On Thursday, he was asked after the morning skate by veteran Toronto Star columnist Rosie DiManno about a statement he made last week in which he said his No. 1 job was to make his players better men; No. 2 was to make them better players.

""One hundred percent,"" Babcock reaffirmed Thursday. ""That's the big thing. It wouldn't matter to me if you're 32 or 42, I believe [in] people doing right every day. And I believe the essence of who you are and the measure of who you are as a man is being a good human being. There's no slipperiness about you, you're honest every day with your effort and how you treat people and the respect you have for the game and for your family, all those things together. The more good people you have on the team, obviously talent is a part of that, but the more good men you have, when you have a certain talent base, the more you win. I'm a big believer in that. So, we're going to have good people here, and we're going to have good players.""

There's no question this next phase for the Leafs is more about teaching and parenting than anything else. The NHL's highest-paid coach is being tasked with grooming these kids into players and men, to create the culture on and off the ice that's been lacking in these parts for, well, a long, long time.

It's a tall order.

Young Leafs players, like Kasperi Kapanen, will have to prove they are tough enough to last in the NHL. Claus Andersen/Getty Images

But again, Babcock can dip into his own personal life as a father of three to help shape his approach at the rink.

""I think your approach changes with every person you coach,"" he said. ""They're at a different stage of your life. One thing that's happened to me is that I've got kids as old as them or older, kids that are athletes and who want to do well. I understand how people need to be spoken to and talked to, but I also understand what accountability is and doing it right. People that love you in your life, and this the biggest thing for me, you hear about a players' coach, what does that mean? The people in your life that love you and care about you, they make you better. And sometimes they have hard decisions and hard discussions with you. But they make you better. Sometimes you don't like [those discussions]. So what? They make you better.""

The apprenticeship has begun for Toronto's future core. It will not be easy under Babcock, of this we are sure. And not every player over the course of this rebuild will be tough enough to stick around, either. Babcock is demanding. But those who do make it will be better for it, both in life and in hockey.",[]

espn.com,,A tale of two Phillies shortstops,['Jayson Stark'],"CLEARWATER, Fla. -- It isn't often in baseball that you can watch the generations converge before your eyes. But when you see it, you know it's special.

So we now present a tale of two shortstops. One is J.P. Crawford. For the team that employs him, the Philadelphia Phillies, he represents the ultimate symbol of what they dream will be a beautiful future, lying just over the horizon.

The other is Larry Bowa. For the Phillies, he is a symbol of one of the most glorious periods from a past that hasn't often been overflowing with glory.

And now, the forces of baseball have brought them together. To the same time. To the same place. To the same franchise. Where past, present and future can intertwine. Where each can leave a powerful impression on the other.

So two or three or four mornings a week, depending on the schedule, they meet on a back field, before the rest of their team begins working out. There, Bowa pounds ground balls in Crawford's direction, one after another, passing along wisdom with every wave of the fungo bat.

""It's a great honor just to be able to be around him,"" Crawford says, respectfully.

""It sort of excites you when you watch him,"" Bowa says, that excitement throbbing in his voice. ""He gives you that extra little adrenaline rush.""

Crawford is Keith Law's No. 4 prospect in the entire sport. A 21-year-old blend of consummate shortstop tools who has arrived in his first big league camp with a .382 career minor league on-base percentage, a .790 OPS and almost as many walks (160) as strikeouts (163). And bear in mind, as you process those numbers, that Crawford has always been one of the youngest players in every league he has played in.

Despite being one of the youngest players at every stop of his minor-league career, J.P. Crawford has produced at a level that has Philadelphia fans dreaming big about the Phillies' shortstop prospect. Justin K. Aller/Getty Images

Bowa, meanwhile, is a Philadelphia legend. A guy whose never-ending bravado was the fuel that never stopped burning through a 16-year big league career. An undersized fireball who came up hearing that he would never hit -- and wound up as one of just 34 shortstops in history to record at least 2,100 hits.

On so many levels, they have nothing in common. But on the level that matters most, they share a bond that will always connect them.

They are shortstops. So no one has to explain to either of them why that unites them in a way that the outside world may never totally understand.

Asked if Bowa's words carry extra weight, just because of the position he played, Crawford nods his head.

""Yeah, just because he's one of the greatest shortstops and he knows what he's talking about,"" Crawford says. ""And he's been there. And it's an honor to have him be the one to teach me the way.""

""You know what?"" Bowa admits, almost guiltily. ""I watched him yesterday.""

He is supposed to watch, of course. Except that on the day he's referring to, his primary gig was managing a Phillies split squad in Tampa. So once he pointed out J.P. Crawford to play shortstop at George M. Steinbrenner Field, well, it caused Bowa's mind to wander.

""I'm sitting over there, and I'm in charge of the game,"" Bowa says. ""But there were two innings where I didn't watch anything that was going on, and I just watched him. How he reacted on foul balls. Was he moving that way? And I had to catch myself. I said, 'Damn, I keep watching J.P.'""

A decade and a half earlier, he recalls, he did the same thing in his first season as the manager of the Phillies, when another kid shortstop caught his eye. That would be a kid named Jimmy Rollins,

""I did the same with Jimmy when he first came up,"" Bowa says. ""I guess it's because you played that position. And it's such an important position out there that I just wanted to see him. And I finally said, 'I've got to quit watching Crawford and watch the game.'""

So what does Bowa see when his eyeballs become so transfixed by this guy? The thoughts come pouring out of the Phillies' turbo-driven bench coach in stream-of-consciousness bursts. So fasten your seat belts firmly. Here they come:

""I see a kid who's got a lot of confidence. ... He's got very soft hands. ... His first step is very quick. ... I love his swing. ... He's got a nice backhand. He's still working on that. ... But his set-up and everything, he's got quick feet. ... There's really not a play, just doing fundamentals, that he's not going to be able to make. ... The slow-hit ball, he probably needs a little work on, but other than that ... his exchange on double plays is very good.""

These thoughts come rat-a-tatting out of Bowa's mouth the way ground balls propel off his fungo bat. So many observations to pass along. Sentence form optional. Thwack. Thwack. Thwack.

But then there are other thoughts, deeper thoughts. Larry Bowa needs to share those, too.

""There's no panic whatsoever in whatever he's doing,"" Bowa says, actually pausing to take a breath. ""And it's not a cool look. It's a look of confidence. He believes he can play up here. I think right now, he believes he can play up here. And he probably could. But let's let the maturation process play out a little bit.""

Nevertheless, Crawford already has a natural swagger. And it reminds Bowa of a great infielder from his past -- but probably not of the guy you'd think. It reminds him, he says, of the third baseman who played next to him for so long, Mike Schmidt.

""Now I'm not comparing him to Mike Schmidt,"" Bowa explains. ""I'm just saying he knows he's a good player. And he handles himself in a way that tells you he's never going to be in awe of any situation he's going to be in up here. Even in spring training, the big leagues, anywhere. I think, if you ask him, 'Can you play in the big leagues?' he's going to say, 'Are you serious? I can play in the big leagues.'""

But Bowa says he hasn't asked Crawford that question yet. So we took over from there. Here's what we asked J.P. Crawford: How much thought has he given to the possibility of making it to Philadelphia this season?

""I hope so,"" Crawford replies. ""I mean, who doesn't hope to be in the bigs? But wherever I'm going to be at, I'm going to be at. And I just want to play my hardest wherever I'm at, and try to help my team win a ball game. And I'm not going to worry about being anywhere. Wherever I'm going to be at, just live in the moment. And when my time comes, it'll come.""

But if all goes as expected, his time figures to come sometime this summer, before he even turns 22. And Bowa finds it interesting that Jimmy Rollins was exactly 21 when he got his first late-season taste of the big leagues. Then, the next spring, Rollins arrived in camp and discovered he had a mentor. That would be his new manager, Larry Bowa.

""Now I'm not comparing him to Mike Schmidt. I'm just saying he knows he's a good player. And he handles himself in a way that tells you he's never going to be in awe of any situation he's going to be in up here. Even in spring training, the big leagues, anywhere. I think, if you ask him, 'Can you play in the big leagues?' he's going to say, 'Are you serious? I can play in the big leagues.'"" Larry Bowa on J.P. Crawford

We'll get back to the connection between Bowa, Rollins and Crawford in a moment. But first, let's stop and reflect on the fascinating paths that lives can take. It may feel as though Bowa has spent the past half-century as a Phillie, but that's not how it worked in real life.

He was a player, then got traded. He was a coach, then got bypassed for the manager's job and exited unhappily. He was a manager, then got fired. And it was only in 2013, after a nine-year gap, that he returned, for a fourth time, to the team that first signed him.

So all told, there have been 19 seasons when Larry Bowa WASN'T a Phillie, which means he very easily could have been elsewhere at a time when Rollins and Crawford were arriving on this scene. Instead, when the earth rotated, it somehow rotated in such a crazy way that Bowa could have an impact on each of those two multi-talented, young shortstops.

Life can be cool that way. Can't it?

Crawford says he's well aware of Bowa's role in Rollins' career, because ""he brought him up a couple of times when we were taking ground balls.""

Larry Bowa believes J.P. Crawford is as advanced defensively as former NL MVP Jimmy Rollins at the age of 21, the age Rollins made it to the majors. Brian Garfinkel/Getty Images

""He said, 'Me and Jimmy did this drill when he was your age,'"" Crawford says. ""It made me want to do the drill. I hope I turn out like him.""

From what Bowa has seen, he believes Crawford is already as advanced a defender as Rollins was at the same age. And that's high-end praise, because ""Jimmy was at the top for me,"" Bowa says.

""When that ball was hit to him (with two outs), I could drop my head and say, 'That's three outs,'"" Bowa goes on. ""I haven't seen J.P. enough. But he gives me that impression that I'm going to want the ball hit to him with two outs in the eighth inning with the bases loaded.""

When Bowa was 21, he was still three years away from the big leagues, hoping to make it to Double-A. So ask him how he compared with Crawford and Rollins at the same age, and he waves his arm, as if to say: Don't even go there. ""Not even close,"" he says. ""Jimmy and J.P., they know they're good. I always said, 'Man, I have to fight. I don't know if I'm good. I think I'm good, but I don't know if I'm good.' But these guys, they know they're good. And you can't teach that, either.""

Yet it means something to Bowa that he left his mark on Rollins' career, and now he has a chance to help shape the journey of another young shortstop with a chance to be a star.

""It gives you satisfaction,"" Bowa says. ""Let's face it. It doesn't matter who's coaching those guys. They're going to be great players. But the fact that you were part of their maturation process, that means a lot when you're a manager or coach. Obviously, you don't want credit for that. But you want them to have a great work ethic. And you want them to understand how the game's supposed to be played. If they do that, you know what? You can walk away and say, 'I did my job.'""

Well, Larry Bowa did his job. Did it then. Keeps doing it now. But he and his latest protege both seem to have an innate understanding that those early-morning fungo sessions are more than just another class at shortstop school. They're a slice of baseball life that doesn't come around too often -- as generations converge.

After they first met, Crawford says, he Googled the name, ""Larry Bowa,"" and ""learned a lot about him. So it's cool that hopefully, he'll be one of my coaches this year.""

But it's just as cool for the guy doing the coaching, because he knows talent when it appears before him -- and especially when it happens to be standing out at shortstop.

""I don't want to make this kid a Hall of Famer yet,"" Larry Bowa says of J.P. Crawford. ""But he's got some great tools. And hopefully, we'll see it unfold before our eyes.""",[]
espn.com,,Four-Ball -- Adam Scott firmly at head of Masters class after WGC-Cadillac Championship victory,"['Gordon Simpson', 'Pa Sport', 'Espn Staff', 'Jason Sobel', 'Bob Harig', 'Michael Collins']","Adam Scott picked up his second win in as many weeks, clearly putting him -- if not at the top, then near the top -- of the list of Masters favorites.

Editor's Picks Resilient Scott proves again he belongs in golf's elite To say Adam Scott knows how to roll with the punches after his back-to-back victories misses the point about how the Aussie has showed that character trait for much of his career.

Lucky breaks fall Adam Scott's way in Doral victory Adam Scott isn't naive enough to think he deserved the fortuitous bounces that helped him win the WGC-Cadillac Championship. He does, however, realize that luck played a part.

Bowditch shoots 37 over, worst WGC score ever Steven Bowditch shot 84 on Sunday to finish the Cadillac Championship at Doral at 37 over, which is the highest score ever in a World Golf Championships event. 2 Related

So how does the Aussie handle the pressure, even though he already owns a green jacket? And what should we make of Rory McIlroy's new left-hand-low putting stroke at Doral?

Our scribes weigh in on those topics and more in this week's edition of Monday Four-Ball.

1. What's the best way for Adam Scott to handle being the favorite to win at Augusta National?

SportsCenter anchor Jonathan Coachman: He has to approach this first major like he has approached the Florida swing -- like he is the best and his putting stroke has been around for years. And that he has the ability to bounce back. At the Honda, he had a quad on the 15th hole in the third round and won. Sunday he had two double-bogeys on the front nine and somehow went bonkers on the back with some good luck and incredible shot-making. Oh and that putting, too.

ESPN.com senior golf analyst Michael Collins: Scott said in his media conference that his dad was watching on TV and said he looked like he was having fun. The key will be for Scott to maintain where he is right now mentally and physically -- and he said as much in the media conference as well. That's much easier said than done.

ESPN.com senior golf writer Bob Harig: Embrace it. Ultimately it means nothing, so simply take it on. Use it as a confidence builder instead of added pressure. Scott knows he is playing well and his game has come together in the past three weeks. Now he simply needs to maintain it.

ESPN.com senior golf writer Jason Sobel: He doesn't have to, because he isn't -- at least not in his mind. When asked after his victory if he was the favorite for next month's major, he quickly deflected that title to Bubba Watson. Whether it's true or not is subject to debate, but if Scott can handle the pressure better by allowing himself to believe he isn't the favorite, then more power to him.

2. On a scale of 1 to 10, how successful was Rory McIlroy's switch to left-hand-low putting?

Coachman: A 7. It seemed natural to watch Rory putt like that. But here's the thing: It's not about the actual stroke that's going to be his downfall. It's the fact that when he is clearly the best player Sunday -- and now two straight chances to win -- he could not finish. This week it was with a 4-shot lead in the final round. Confidence is a crazy thing and when it goes, it goes in every aspect of your game. Rory needs to know this putting stroke will win him golf tournaments. Just stay with it.

Collins: A 7. A win would have been a 10. Like figure skating, throw out his best day (23 putts) and worst (33) and his putting was good. Too bad in golf you don't get to throw out any of your stats. I think Rory sticks with this and becomes better than he has been lately.

Harig: An 8. It's hard to put his final-round play on putting, and to be in the lead a week after making such a switch was impressive. Such changes can take a long time to adopt and he seemed to be better for it immediately.

Sobel: It was a 10. His putting was never the problem this week, save for a few missed shorties in the opening round. It was his shot-making that eluded him on Sunday afternoon, as he struggled to hit any approach shots anywhere close to the hole. He looked comfortable with the new stroke and, most importantly, he maintained it already feels instinctive to him.

3. With the new PGA Tour/LPGA Tour partnership, if they do a combined tournament, what format should they use?

Coachman: I can't wait for this to potentially happen. I think they should do three different formats, and then on Sunday take your combined score for each men's and women's team. Thursday is four-balls. Friday is foursomes. And on Saturday, the guys play even holes and women play the odd holes. This way, it's four completely different formats and the team that adapts the best will win. How much fun would that be?

Collins: Does anyone remember the old JC Penny Classic? They should play three different ways. Best Ball, Alternate Shot and modified Alternate Shot (allow each team to choose who hits the tee shot, but each player must hit an equal amount). Mic the players and the caddies for three days and put it on HBO.

Harig: They should strive to have two events in one. Individual stroke-play on respective tours as well as best ball among a male and female partner. That is the best of both worlds. Put the teams together in the same group each day. If one or the other misses the cut in the individual portion, they still play on in the team format. The guess is this will also be an easier sell, as it means everyone still gets to play for themselves.

Sobel: Let's slow down a little bit here. That's a major hypothetical that they'll even play a joint event in the future. I asked PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem about this possibility on Sunday afternoon and he immediately started listing the potential issues in putting together an event like this. So before we start picking a format, let's just wait and see if it can actually become a reality.

4. How big a deal is it that there are no ""name"" players teeing it up in the Olympic test event this week?

Coachman: Not a big deal at all. The Masters is in a month. There are a bunch of big tournaments coming up. Best believe if it wasn't a 10-hour flight, more guys would be going. You can't make that trip and have it not affect you. The only way I would go is if I wasn't going to make the Olympics and I just wanted a free trip to say I played the course. But trust me, no one is going to be losing any sleep over not seeing Jordan Spieth play this course until the summer.

Collins: Fly overnight for a one-day event that doesn't count for anything? Big deal? No! Skipping it is the smartest thing the big names could do. There's no weird format to practice, so going there and losing three full days off is not something a top golfer would do.

Harig: None whatsoever. The idea, mostly, for the test event is to work out the various kinks in scoring, transportation to and from the course with volunteers and test the playing conditions. It doesn't matter that Jordan Spieth and Rory McIlroy won't be there, especially for a one-day event. Ideally there would have been a 72-hole tournament, maybe a PGA Tour Latino America event either last fall or this spring. But it didn't work out and logistics suggest none of the big-game players will be able to make it there at this time during the season.

Sobel: Not a big deal at all. I ran into Olympic course designer Gil Hanse on Sunday and he sounded extremely confident that his new track is ready to go. Hanse is hardly a stranger to designing and setting up championship-caliber golf courses, so he knows what it takes to have one ready for this summer. The test event will help work out some potential logistical issues, but the playability of the course isn't one of them.",[]
espn.com,,Yoan behold: Red Sox call up top prospect Moncada for spring game,"['Scott Lauber', 'One Naci N']","BRADENTON, Fla. -- Try though he did, Boston Red Sox manager John Farrell was unable to downplay the call-up of top prospect Yoan Moncada for Wednesday's spring-training game against the Pittsburgh Pirates.

""This is an opportunity for some young players to come over and get some exposure to this environment, the game at this speed and strength,"" Farrell said. ""Today's another one of those days for him.""

Pressed for more on the 20-year-old Cuban second baseman in whom the Red Sox invested a total of $63 million last spring ($31.5 million signing bonus, $31.5 million tax to Major League Baseball for exceeding their international bonus pool), Farrell described Moncada as a ""young, athletic guy who seemingly has a really bright future"" before joking the club called him up to ""give you something to write about.""

Moncada overcame a slow start last season to bat .278 with eight homers, 49 stolen bases and an .817 OPS in 81 games for Single-A Greenville. He's expected to open the season at advanced-A Salem, but given his exceeding talent, could move quickly through the upper levels of the farm system.

One unresolved issue surrounding Moncada is which position he's best suited to play. He played primarily second base in Cuba and has thus far remained there even though Dustin Pedroia is signed through 2021. Pedroia is the Red Sox's de facto captain and a favorite of principal owner John Henry, and even if he wasn't, he has limited no-trade protection and will reach 10-5 status (at least 10 seasons in the big leagues and five with the same team) later this season.

Listed at 6-foot-2 and 215 pounds, Moncada is bigger than most second basemen. He also committed 23 errors last season for Greenville, leading some scouts to suggest his future might be at first or third base or even in the outfield.

""I don't know if that (big body) is a root cause of the defensive side of things,"" Farrell said. ""As far as physical profile to a position, he's a speedy guy that's strong, switch-hitter. Where he ultimately ends up on the field remains to be seen.""

Regardless, the Red Sox will take the opportunity to get an up-close look at Moncada. Later in spring training, Farrell said he would like to see several of the team's infield prospects on the field together in a Grapefruit League game. First base prospect Sam Travis is already in big-league camp, but Moncada and even third base prospect Rafael Devers could be called in for a cameo.

""Part of the discussion with (president of bsaeball operations) Dave (Dombrowski), with (general manager) Mike (Hazen), with (farm director) Ben Crockett, you start to ask about certain individual players that can fill in at some point,"" Farrell said, ""start to give them exposure.""

Here's the full lineup against Pirates right-hander Ryan Vogelsong:

LF Rusney Castillo

espn.com,,Tournament Challenge: Get in on the excitement of this year'...,['Matt Draper'],"Welcome to the 2016 men's basketball Tournament Challenge. It's that time of year again, when all the chatter about teams involves phrases like: body of work; good wins; bad losses; and of course, RPIs, resumes and the dreaded ""bubble."" Once the field of 68 has been announced, though, how teams got in matters little, and the excitement of filling out your bracket begins.

All you have to do is select who you think will win each of the 63 tournament games, which start March 17 (for those hoping to pick the First Four games, you'll have to give our Streak for the Cash game a try). For each game you get right, you earn points. The point value for a correct pick increases with each round of the tournament, culminating with the championship game on April 4 in Houston. Once you've made your selections, all you do is sit back, relax and pull for your picks to survive and advance.

If you score the most points, you'll have a chance to win the grand prize of a $10,000 Amazon Gift Card and a trip to the 2016 Maui Invitational.

Considering the unpredictable nature of the tournament every year, you certainly don't have to be a college basketball savant to be successful. It's a fun and easy game to play against friends, family and coworkers. You'll see the seeds on the bracket, which will give you a better idea of which teams are expected to advance in each round. But don't be too influenced by those numbers, because upsets happen every year, and picking the right ones is what separates the haves from the have-nots in Tournament Challenge.

And that's where the real fun lies.

It's your bracket. Pick whatever you want. Better yet, we'll give you the opportunity to fill out up to 10 brackets, so you can get creative with your picks and hedge your bets, if you so choose. Pick the school with the best colors, take your chances with the schools closest to where you live, play the mascot card when determining your selections.

Want to play it safe and take the chalk picks to reach the Final Four? Last year featured three No. 1 seeds in the semifinals (Duke, Wisconsin, Kentucky) along with No. 7 Michigan State, with Duke going on to win the championship over Wisconsin.

Or do you want to be bold and take a huge underdog to make a deep run? If you know someone who pegged seventh-seeded UConn to win it all in 2014, it's likely they'll never let you forget it. Plus, in the past four years, teams seeded 14th or worse have seven wins in the round of 64. In 2015, a pair of 14-seeds pulled off upsets, including Georgia State beating Baylor and UAB defeating Iowa State. Will results like these persuade you to pick upsets, or do you expect higher seeds to hold up their end this year?

It has been a topsy-turvy season at or near the top of the rankings, with Kansas, Villanova, Oklahoma, Michigan State, North Carolina and Kentucky among the teams to occupy the No. 1 slot. With so much movement at the top, will you pick a blue-blood program like Kansas to win it all, or do you go with a less-heralded contender such as Xavier, which has yet to reach a Final Four?

espn.com,,"Right man, wrong park: Players who toil in home ballparks that don't suit their skills","['Eno Sarris', 'Chris Forsberg', 'Wayne Drehs', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Bill Barnwell', 'Eric Williams', 'Royce Young', 'Jeff Goodman', 'Dan Graziano', 'Espn Com']","Insider

One of the things that makes baseball unique from other sports is how ballparks differ. One even has a hill in the outfield! That's glorious.

It also means that, for 81 games at least, your favorite team's players are subject to the nooks and crannies of their home field. And we're not just talking about obvious things like Charlie Blackmon taking advantage of that huge outfield in Coors Field or Adrian Beltre embracing Fenway Park and Texas' Globe Life Park after toiling in Seattle's pitcher-friendly Safeco Field.

Right-handed hitters like Evan Longoria are at a decided disadvantage when it comes to going deep at Tropicana Field. Steve Mitchell/USA TODAY Sports

Did you know that, according to StatCorner's park factors, Fenway's deep center field makes it the second-hardest place for a left-hander to hit a home run? Even harder than it is to do so in Miami? Or that, last year, lefties loved hitting homers in Tampa Bay's Tropicana Field, but righties hated the place? That was the second-largest discrepancy -- second to Fenway's numbers -- between lefties and righties in the game.

This, of course, all suggests that several players out there are poor fits for their home park. And, in a similar vein, that pitchers with certain splits are ill-suited for some of those parks -- and at a disadvantage in front of some of those defenses that will take the field behind them.

So let's take a look at this year's square pegs in round holes. Baseball's likely worst fits of the upcoming season include:

Evan Longoria, 3B, Tampa Bay Rays: Longoria has twice hit 30 home runs, so he has showed power in spite of his tough home park, Tropicana Field. But now that he's 30, Longoria's game isn't quite the same. His walk and strikeout rates are average (or worse) now, his defense is closer to scratch and he's not as limber on the basepaths as he used to be. Longoria is not quite a power-only hitter, but he's getting close to becoming one. And although left-handed hitters found the Trop 19 percent easier than average to hit homers in last year, righties like Longoria found that it was 16 percent harder than average to go deep in Tampa.",[]
espn.com,,NBA DFS tipoff for March 9,"['Renee Miller', 'Tom Carpenter', 'Espn Com Staff', 'Jim Mccormick', 'Joe Kaiser', 'Leo Howell']","Each morning we provide the fantasy basketball tipoff, in which we examine several key angles to get you ready for this evenings season-long and daily fantasy action. We have nine games on tap Wednesday, so lets tip it off.

Primetime matchup

The game between the Clippers and Thunder in Oklahoma City on Wednesday (9:30 p.m. ET on ESPN/WatchESPN) is definitely the one with the highest potential entertainment value, but is there fantasy value to be found as well?

Here are some fantasy facts about this Western Conference clash:

DeAndre Jordan has three 20-point, 15-rebound games this year, and all of them have come over the past month, with one against the Thunder. He's been thrust into a bigger role with Blake Griffin out, and it untaps his potential as a scoring and rebound threat.

Jordan is averaging 20 points, 16.3 rebounds and 2.7 blocks over his past three games.

The Clippers are third in defensive efficiency in the NBA since Griffin was sidelined, according to ESPN Stats & Info.

On the other hand, the Thunder have gone downhill on defense since the All-Star break, going from 101.6 to 110.7 when comparing pre- and post-break numbers.

However, OKC holds a big advantage against the Clippers on the glass, as the Thunder are one of the top rebounding teams in the NBA, especially on offense. Los Angeles allows the seventh-most offensive rebounds in the NBA, while the Thunder rank first in offensive rebounds, offensive rebound percentage and second-chance points per game.

And while both Russell Westbrook and Kevin Durant have been fantasy superstars all season, it's been Durant who has stepped up his production in recent games. Over his past six outings, Durant is averaging 31.7 points, 11.7 rebounds and 6.7 assists while shooting over 50 percent from the floor.

Isaiah Thomas delivers

The Celtics play fast and like to score on the break under head coach Brad Stevens, and no player has personified that better in recent games than Isaiah Thomas. The Boston guard is fifth in the NBA in fastbreak points per game with 5.1, but has 7.1 points on the break over his last ten outings, per ESPN Stats & Info.

And while the Grizzlies are usually not a very exciting matchup (average defensive efficiency with a slow pace), they are among the top 10 teams in the NBA in points allowed on the break, per the league's official stats. And if Mike Conley misses out on Wednesday's game, the defense Thomas will face will be significantly downgraded.

Over the past 10 games, Thomas has been performing at a high level across multiple categories, scoring just fewer than 25 PPG with more than seven assists per contest and three 30-point outings.

Thomas faces a difficult individual matchup on Wednesday (the Grizzlies allow the seventh-fewest FanDuel PPG to opposing point guards this season), but his strong recent performances and ability to score on the fastbreak could allow him to overcome this obstacle and be an underrated fantasy star for daily players.

Bargain bin

Here are some of the potential bargain players for tonight's slate of daily fantasy contests:

Ronnie Price and Archie Goodwin will continue to see increased minutes, while Devin Booker will see more minutes and a bigger role if Brandon Knight remains out for the Suns. However, if Knight returns, those players will be tough to trust.

Shelvin Mack has stepped into a bigger role with his new team, the Jazz, and tonight gets a surprisingly good matchup against the Warriors. Golden State will push up Utah's normally slow tempo, and Stephen Curry does not limit opposing PG's production (over the last 10 games, the Warriors have allowed the most points per game to opposing point guards, per Rotowire).

If Mike Conley doesn't play for the Grizzlies, Mario Chalmers should see a bigger role in an uptempo game against Boston.

Likewise, JaMychal Green will benefit from the higher pace of the Memphis/Boston game, and has six double-digit scoring games since Marc Gasol was injured.

Pick up the pace

As mentioned earlier, the Grizzlies (tied for the second-worst pace in the NBA) will play at a higher tempo tonight as dictated by their opponents, the Celtics (who rank third in the NBA in pace). A few other teams will see a boost in possessions and opportunities tonight, which is important to consider when setting fantasy lineups.

The Kings, who have the top pace in the league, host the Cavaliers, who are tied with Memphis for the second-worst mark in the league in this category. Another huge disparity that should lead to a boost in production for Cleveland's players. PLAY FOR FREE Love daily fantasy? You should try a fantasy baseball points league. CREATE OR JOIN A LEAGUE TODAY

Golden State will host Utah in a matchup of the second-fastest pace versus the slowest pace. Again, this is a huge boost for Utah, which will only be limited by its ability to stay competitive against the Warriors.

The Suns rank fourth in pace and host the Knicks, who play at the sixth-slowest tempo. New York players get a nice boost this evening, as well.

From downtown

Looking for 3-point shooters to unlock a bit of upside for your fantasy lineups? Here are the players with the most made 3s since Feb. 1, per Statmuse:

Curry's position on this list isn't surprising, but Smith and Teletovic are names to consider if you're looking for scoring potential.

Smith dropped 22 points on the Kings the last time the Cavs played Sacramento, and is never shy about scoring when he gets a chance.

Teletovic has scored 16.8 points per game over his last 10, a boost from his 11.1 average on the season. He's taken at least five 3s in nine straight games.",[]
espn.com,,Henrik Lundqvist of New York Rangers on track to return by weekend,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Dan Marrazza', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Sean Allen', 'John Buccigross', 'Sarah Goldstein', 'Scott Burnside', 'Paul Grant']","BUFFALO, N.Y. -- New York Rangers coach Alain Vigneault says goalie Henrik Lundqvist's neck spasms have subsided and he's on track to return by this weekend.

And forward Rick Nash shouldn't be far behind.

Vigneault provided the updates before the Rangers game at Buffalo on Tuesday, and after Lundqvist and Nash practiced on their own in New York.

What does Mario Williams signing with Miami mean? (2:58)

The Miami Dolphins are bringing in defensive end Mario Williams on a two-year deal, making the future cloudy for Olivier Vernon, who received the team's transition tag last week.

Williams' addition allows Miami to remove Vernon's transition tag and let him walk in free agency. Williams should slot in opposite Cameron Wake to give the Dolphins two legitimate pass-rushers on the edge. He is a solid schematic fit in Miami, but scheme wasn't his problem in Buffalo in 2015, despite his many protestations to the contrary.",[]

Arizona signed former Kansas City Chiefs safety Tyvon Branch, according to ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. The deal was reportedly for two years and worth up to $10 million, according to multiple reports.

The Cardinals did not re-sign former safety Rashad Johnson, 30, before free agency began Wednesday afternoon.

The Chiefs signed Branch, 29, to a one-year contract last season, and though he started just one game in the regular season and one in the playoffs, he still was a valuable member of Kansas City's defense.

Branch scored two of Kansas City's six defensive touchdowns in 2015, one on an interception return and one on a fumble return. The interception-return touchdown came against his former team, the Raiders, in Week 13.

Branch also proved he could last a full season. He played in all 16 regular-season games plus both in the playoffs. He had played in just five games over the previous two seasons with Oakland because of injuries.

Barkley and Miller, both TNT analysts, were critical of the New York Knicks' offense during a conference call on Tuesday with reporters.

Barkley doesn't believe Phil Jackson's triangle offense will cure all that ails the Knicks.

""It's all about the players,"" Barkley said, according to Newsday. ""I've said this before: Without Kobe [Bryant] and Shaq [Shaquille O'Neal] and Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, the triangle is just a circle.""

Miller questioned the future of the Knicks under Jackson, and also ripped the triangle offense.

""What does Phil want to do?"" Miller said, according to the New York Post. ""What does [owner James] Dolan want to do going forward with this? How do we want to play? Are we going to continue with this triangle crap or are we going to play a traditional free-flowing style like the Warriors play?

espn.com,,Davis Cup Australia U.S. Day Three Kooyong,"['Niall Seewang', 'Greg Garber', 'Mark Hodgkinson', 'Nic Atkin', 'Peter Bodo', 'Pa Sport', 'Espn Com', 'Espn Staff']","KOOYONG -- John Isner produced a ""breathtaking"" all-round display to guide the U.S. to victory in their Davis Cup World Group first-round tie against Australia.

The world No. 11 withstood a belated charge from Australia's Bernard Tomic at Melbourne's historic Kooyong, prevailing 6-4, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (7-4) to give the U.S. a 3-1 victory that wrapped up the best-of-five tie to progress to a home quarterfinal tie against Croatia or Belgium in July.

U.S. captain Jim Courier described the result as ""massive"" after what he described as ""tough couple of years for us"" in reference to World Group defeats by Great Britain in 2014 and 2015. ""This was a touch match-up on paper and it was a tough match-up in reality. For us to get to the second round is a big deal.""

Australia needed Tomic at his best if they were to avoid losing to the U.S. on home soil for the first time since 1982, but the world No. 20 initially had no answers against his red-hot opponent.

Fresh from a dominant straight-set victory over Sam Groth on Friday, Isner was again in scintillating form. His serve, of course, is always a major weapon, and his 49 aces against Tomic featured the fastest in ATP Tour and Davis Cup history at 157 mph (253 km/h), usurping the 156 mph bullet fired by Ivo Karlovic on Davis Cup duty for Croatia in 2011; but his groundstrokes, volleying and court craft were also too much for Tomic early.

In front of a passionate home crowd, Tomic - who had a medical time-out after dropping his serve in the seventh game of the second set - struggled with his movement and body language through the first two sets before finally finding some fight in the third.

Tomic claimed the set on his fifth break point of an epic game, bringing the previously subdued crowd to its feet, and he continued his fight in the fourth only to come up short against Isner, who, fittingly, claimed the match with two enormous serves. Tomic previously had lost only three of 19 Davis Cup singles.

Courier described Isner's performance as ""breathtaking"", saying ""he stepped up big for us, he's done it for us in Davis Cup before and he's done it again today.""

John Isner said: ""The first two sets went really well but I knew, being Davis Cup and the crowd on his side, he was going to make a push, and he did in the third set, but ... I was serving really well and was able to close it out in four.""

On Saturday, U.S brothers Mike and Bob Bryan defeated Lleyton Hewitt and John Peers after Friday's singles matches - between Isner and Groth, and Tomic and Jack Sock - were split.

The tie was the 46th between Australia and the U.S, the first since the 1999 quarterfinals. The U.S. has been crowned Davis Cup champions on 32 occasions, with Australia second with 28.",[]
espn.com,,Team Liquid's Lourlo adjusting to rookie season in NA LCS,"['Tyler Erzberger', 'Tyler Fionn', 'James Bates', 'Timothy Lee']","It's been topsy-turvy for the last squad to take home the honors of best regular-season team. The issues of 2015 have transitioned into this year, as the talented Team Liquid (6-7) has found itself up early in games but unable to close the door against opponents. Often the squad has been able to carve out an advantage in the early game or gone into the climactic moments of a set on a knife-edge, yet over-extensions and miscommunication have left the team with more losses than wins.

""At the start [of the season] I wasn't where I wanted to be,"" said TL's top laner, Samson ""Lourlo"" Jackson, when questioned about a rocky first split in the NA LCS as a rookie. ""So I've been putting in way more work -- like doing anything I can to become a better player. I still definitely have a lot of weaknesses, but I'm still going to keep trying and try to be the best player I can.""

Liquid has seen itself become a younger unit from the experienced group that grabbed first place in the regular season last year. Lourlo was the beginning of that rookie movement, and he's been joined by two Liquid Academy members, Joshua ""Dardoch"" Hartnett and Matthew ""Matt"" Elento, to create a mechanically talented -- yet green -- Liquid starting five. The three rookies are all either 18 years old or younger, making the new TL one of the youngest squads in either LCS. Editor's Picks CLG's Darshan reflects on ending Immortals' perfect NA LCS split After 12 consecutive wins to open the NA LCS spring split, Immortals finally fell at the hands of Counter Logic Gaming. Darshan reflects on that win, and looks forward at CLG's prospects.

How Dardoch is leading Team Liquid's youth revolution Team Liquid's 17-year-old rookie says he's going to be one of the best players in the NA LCS. 1 Related

Fortunately for Lourlo, coming into the professional scene with players his same age has made the transition less strenuous.

""Being friends, we're there for each other,"" he said of Dardoch, his partner in the jungle. Dardoch has made waves in his first season as a 17-year-old jungler, routinely being the star in Liquid's victories as its free-flowing and highly aggressive frontman. ""Overall, we're just good friends, and [it helps] having him on the team.""

Newcomers to the scene generally have a player or two they've watched in the amateur scene that inspire them as they come up to the pros. It's no different for TL's starting top laner, as he is a fan of one of the best currently playing in Korea.

""I really look up to [Song ""Smeb"" Kyung-ho] because he started out his career [with difficulties], and he's worked really, really hard to become where he is now,"" Lourlo said. ""It's really inspiring that he showed that hard work can pay off.""

Lourlo is also a fan of Smeb's current team, the ROX Tigers, which currently sits in first place in the LCK with an undefeated match record. When I asked which player he would like to play with out of anyone in the world, he answered the team's jungler, Yoon ""Peanut"" Wang-ho, due to his synergy with Smeb and his similarities with TL's offensive jungler.

""Peanut reminds me of Dardoch,"" he said. ""He's like the Korean Dardoch. I just want to see how he [would] fit on the team, like what he does and how he communicates.""

In a dogfight for one of the last playoff spots in the NA LCS, Team Liquid is battling with two competitors in Echo Fox (5-8) and NRG Esports (7-6) during the final weeks. Although Echo Fox has won out four out of its last five, Lourlo thinks the team with an up-and-down split -- like Liquid -- is the tougher challenge.

""I really respect NRG because they have Jung 'Impact' Eon-yeong,"" he said. ""I looked up to him for a bit in the NA scene [due to] being regarded as one of the best tops in NA. I really look up to NRG because they have Impact, so I'm a little biased, but I think overall NRG is a better team.""

But who does Lourlo think is the best top laner in the world?

To no surprise, he selected the player that he looks up to the most -- ROX's prideful and hard-working ace, Smeb.

""His champion pool is really good, and whatever champion he plays he performs well on it,"" he said. ""You can see in the LCK that he pulls so many bans with Fiora -- then he just plays something like Nautilus and does super well for his team. Players like that just really impress me.""

If Lourlo wants a chance at possibly meeting Smeb, Peanut and the rest of the ROX Tigers at the Mid-Season Invitational, he'll need to turn around this bumpy ride. His team will head out on the Rift once again on Sunday to see if it can get back to .500, going one-on-one with a squad it barely lost to in the first half of the season, Team SoloMid (8-5).",[]

After the first 10 games of the season, the Anaheim Ducks appeared to be dead in the water. They were outscored 29-10 and outshot 251-219 during that brutal 1-7-2 stretch.

espn.com,,The Great Chinese Collapse of the Shanghai Major,"['James Obscurica', 'James Bates', 'Alan Nahaz', 'Obscurica Chen', 'Stephen Chiu', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Timothy Lee', 'Tyler Fionn', 'Erzberger James', 'Chase Geddes']","Earlier Wednesday morning, Newbee, playing with three International champions on the roster, became the last of five Chinese teams in a 16-team field to be eliminated from the Shanghai Major. No Chinese team will finish in the top eight at Shanghai, and it'll be the first time in Dota 2 history this has happened at a Valve-sponsored event. The utter collapse of Chinese teams in this tournament is simply mind-blowing, to the point that it is difficult to put this in perspective.

The Great Chinese Collapse was as unexpected as it was complete. EHOME were arguably the odds-on favorites coming into Shanghai, as they handily defeated The International 5 Champions Evil Geniuses 3-0 in the Grand Finals of the MarsTV Finals, an over $275,000 LAN event held six weeks ago in China. EHOME also defeated Frankfurt Major Champions OG in the Winner's Bracket Final of that event. Long-time Chinese powerhouse LGD, deprived of the direct invite to Shanghai that many expected, breezed through what was at the time considered a loaded field in the Chinese qualifiers for the Shanghai Major. LGD followed this by finishing in the top 4 at Star Ladder's Season 13 Finals earlier in January, after suffering a narrow 2-1 defeat to EG in a single-elimination playoff bracket, and repeated the feat at MarsTV.

Then disaster struck. At Shanghai, Chinese teams went 15-27 in individual matches (or maps), and only 8-17 (32%) against competition from outside China. Unbelievably, Chinese teams were only 2-11 in series (including the best-of-three series played in last week's GSL-format group phase, LGD's loss in the upper bracket and four best-of-one losses in lower bracket elimination matches) against non-Chinese opponents. Both series wins came against Archon, considered by many the weakest team in the field before the tournament began.

We have to start somewhere. The Dota 2 Asia Championships, held almost exactly one year ago, whose roughly $3 million prize pool was at the time the largest for an event outside The International, were at the time considered a massive disappointment for Chinese Dota 2. Nine teams in the 16-team field were Chinese (four directly invited, four qualifier slots and wild-card qualifier HGT). Only three of the nine finished in the top half of round robin play, and only two of the nine finished in the top six overall. Vici Gaming, at the time the top Chinese team, was shut out 3-0 by Evil Geniuses in the Grand Final. Newbee, who months before won The International 2014 and its nearly $11 million prize pool (then by far the largest in esports history), finished 2-13 in group stage matches, second to last in the field, and were eliminated from the tournament before the playoffs began.

DAC 2015 left the Chinese Dota 2 community searching for answers. Some in the scene claimed the Chinese New Year, which sees a one- to two-week or more shutdown of most of the country's commerce, partially responsible for the results. Most top pro Dota 2 teams ""bootcamp,"" which means spending several weeks living together in intense practice prior to Major events such as Shanghai. The holiday period is certainly disruptive to this -- arguably much more so than an event beginning Jan. 2 would be for Western teams. Others blamed complacency, with well-publicized stories of Newbee's players spending late nights before the event playing MMORPGs, and logging little to no time playing Dota 2 over the prior weeks or even months.

Whatever the explanation, if DAC were disappointment, Shanghai is devastation. As with many of these tournaments, we can't meaningfully compare to Shanghai's 2-11 series record because the DAC group phase was played in a round robin format. But Chinese teams went 79-95 overall in matches (maps) at DAC, including 42-50 (46%) against teams from outside China (compare to 8-17, 32%, at Shanghai). As disappointing as Newbee looked, the top two Chinese finishers (VG and ""all-star team"" Big God) actually defeated all three of the top Western powers at the time (EG, Team Secret and Cloud9) in best-of-three series in the Winner's Bracket playoff. By contrast, only LGD appeared in a best-of-three playoff series at Shanghai and lost 2-0 to SEA Qualifier team MVP Phoenix in the two shortest matches (23 and 27 minutes) of the playoffs so far.

Bai ""rOtk"" Fan of LGD at the Frankfurt Major Steffie Wunderl/ESL

Some pro Dota 2 analysts still bring up Southeast Asian team MUFC's infamous 0-15 record at The International 2013. (I'm one of them, and we're mostly doing it to have a little fun with Chan Litt Binn, better known as ""WinteR,"" who played on that MUFC team and is one of the best analytical casters out there currently.) Again, though, any comparison between SEA at TI3 and China at Shanghai is not even close. Two other SEA teams, Orange Esports and Zenith, both posted winning records at the same event. Orange finished third overall at the tournament, bowing out to runners-up Na'Vi in a thrilling 2-1 loss in the Loser's Bracket Final. A year later, fellow SEA team Arrow Gaming finished 2-13 at The International 2014, but here again, fellow SEA team Titan finished 8-7 in round-robin play and were eliminated by eventual champion Newbee in a rather odd tournament format.

As bad as Shanghai has looked for Chinese teams, it has quite possibly looked worse for China's superstar players. Xu ""BurNIng"" Zhilei, once accorded legendary status as the game's top all-time carry position player, had 23 kills and 23 deaths in six games. Throw out a 9-0 performance against SEA qualifier team FNATIC (in a series his team eventually lost), and he is averaging 2.8 kills and 4.6 deaths in the remaining five games. Ren ""ELeVeN"" Yangwei, EHOME's rising offlane superstar, posted his four lowest assist totals in 40 games played in the current patch in EHOME's games on opening day of the event, and he was reportedly hospitalized before their final series because of a tooth infection. He finished the event averaging 5.9 deaths per game, with the five highest totals among 80 players competing.

Perhaps worst of all, the Collapse leaves the Chinese Dota scene vulnerable at a critical time. The great roster shuffles that follow every Major -- which see teams remade, born and die as players search for their best possible chances at the next multi-million dollar event -- take on an unprecedented urgency after Shanghai. Because of the new Dota 2 Major cycle, players who commit to a roster will be locked in for the next two Valve-sponsored events, including the Spring Major in Manila as well as The International 2016, likely to be the third straight edition with an eight-figure prize. Chinese organizations, which had made strides recently in their development of young talent, will once again be forced to choose between aging superstars and untested but talented youngsters. There will be no free passes. Although it's early, after their performance at Shanghai, not a single Chinese team is a safe bet for a direct invite to Manila.

In just over a week at Shanghai, production and personnel problems have dominated coverage of the tournament. But the Great Collapse of Chinese teams at this event could very well have a much bigger impact on the country's Dota 2 scene going forward. It's difficult to find words for how shocking and unprecedented this is. We'll settle for three that Paul ""ReDeYe"" Chaloner used at Frankfurt:

His 75,066th mile surpassed by one mile the distance covered by Tommy Godwin of Great Britain, who pedaled to his record in 1939.

Searvogel has averaged more than 208 miles per day since starting out in Florida on Jan. 10, 2015. Supported by his girlfriend, Alicia -- who became his wife in October -- the 52-year-old entrepreneur and veteran endurance athlete from Arkansas cycled through the South, up through Arkansas and the Midwest to Wisconsin, then back to Florida.

Though it was an obscure record even in the cycling community, the highest annual mileage record had lasted more than 75 years and was considered untouchable. Godwin had averaged more than 205 miles per day. As the year progressed, however, the record and Searvogels attempt drew more attention.

When Kurt and Alicia -- who joined him on her bike Monday at mile 75,061 -- broke through the banner, cruising side-by-side in front of a small group of supporters and cyclists, along with a film crew and members of the media, the record was his with five days to spare.

Searvogel, who said he still feels strong physically, said all the time and money spent (an estimated $75,000) were worth it.

Yeah, Im happy I did it, he said. It was the unbreakable record and now its broken, so its done.

Kurt and Alicia had a quiet celebration with friends at a pub Monday night, then Searvogel was back on his bike Tuesday to add to his total until he stops on Jan. 9.

Were going to pad it a little so we can make it more unbreakable again, but at some point somebody with the same physical abilities as me and mental abilities as me is going to get enough money together and do it and break it, he said.

At least two cyclists have already begun campaigns to break his record. He laughs and says he doesnt care.

I cant stop them, he said. I have no control over what somebody else does, so I cant worry about it.",[]

Warren (13-5) looked out of place from the opening bell. Caldwell, a former NCAA Division I national wrestling champion, scored an outside trip on Warren in the opening seconds. As Warren scrambled and attempted to work to his feet, Caldwell rotated to his back and began popping him with left hands near the fence.

After Warren managed to stand completely upright, Caldwell suplexed him violently back to the mat, where he slid his left arm under the chin. Warren refused to tap and went out. It's his second loss via submission in three fights.

McIlroy began his fourth round with a three-shot lead, but managed just one birdie in his closing 18 holes at Doral to finish in a tie for third with Englishman Danny Willett.

espn.com,,300: The Steph Curry bailout plan,"['Espn Com', 'Chad Ford', 'Kevin Pelton', 'Ethan Sherwood Strauss']","OAKLAND, Calif. -- After letting garbage time become crunch time, the Golden State Warriors closed out the Orlando Magic 119-113 for their NBA-record 45th consecutive regular-season home victory. This achievement brings a bifurcated response: There's an acknowledgement of the incredible accomplishment, then a nod to the issues it's overshadowing.

Warriors coach Steve Kerr summarized Golden State's recent run with, ""Steph is bailing us out an awful lot."" Monday night was illustrative of that issue, plus a reminder that there are worse bailout plans. As Golden State trundled along sans Andre Iguodala and with an ailing Draymond Green, Curry was a brilliant bulwark against failure. He scored 41 points, claimed 13 boards and hit seven 3-pointers, one of which was his 300th of the season. Curry dropped that one from 28 feet away, after torturing Ersan Ilyasova with seven crossovers.

Of the benchmark, Curry said, ""It's special and it's never been done before in history."" He later called the accomplishment ""surreal,"" which it certainly is, especially since it's early March. For comparison's sake, Steph's father, Dell -- himself a 3-point sniper -- needed seven seasons to reach 300 career 3s made.

Not since Leonidas has a man with ""300"" led warriors so impressively. Since the All-Star break, Golden State has needed spectacular Curry performances to pull out wins. Thankfully for the Warriors, ""spectacular"" is his default mode, especially of late. During this stretch, Curry has averaged 35.7 points in 34.9 minutes on 69.7 percent shooting -- numbers that shouldn't be possible.

If Curry weren't trending impossible, the Warriors would look vulnerable. Though the Warriors have an 8-2 record since the break, they're grinding out these wins with a lukewarm +1.4 point differential. Even worse: They got blown out by the Lakers of Los Angeles.

Kerr cites defensive slippage as a major issue. After his ""Steph is bailing us out an awful lot"" comment, Kerr continued: ""But we can't count on that. We can't rely on that. We need to get back to being the best defensive team in the league, which we were a year ago, which we're not right now anywhere close to.""

Festus Ezeli's absence might account for some of this, but there's likely another explanation: Unlike last year, this Golden State knows it can win without maximum effort. This iteration might be more inclined to pace themselves in a regular-season game.

There's also the turnover issue, a pet peeve of Kerr's. ""Some are going to happen,"" Kerr said of his team's 24 giveaways on Tuesday night. ""But I could rattle off 10, easy, that were just inexcusable. That's kind of our weakness, is that sometimes the game comes too easy for our guys and they just think they can do anything; and we've got a lot of talent and a lot of skill, and what we have to get back to is just simple, simple, simple, and that's good enough. The simple leads to the spectacular.""

""The simple leads to the spectacular."" If Golden State is indeed in a minifunk, perhaps that adage can lead the way. It's difficult to know whether the Warriors will absorb that motto until they absolutely must. Their 3-point shooting represents a larger margin for error than anyone else boasts. You could see that massive margin's representation when Klay Thompson hit a dagger 3-pointer after Curry, and subsequently Green, lost the ball in his general direction. It's easy to get complacent when your worst offensive plays end in three points.",[]

A well-rested Ryan Moore could be a sleeper pick for your DFS team this week at Innisbrook's Copperhead Course, says ESPN.com's Michael Collins. (0:45)

PALM HARBOR, Fla. -- There's a big difference between smart research and extraneous analysis.

I'll admit that I might be guilty of the latter this week.

About a month ago, I had an opportunity to tee it up at Innisbrook's Copperhead Course, host of this week's Valspar Championship. Over the past few years, the Copperhead track has been lauded by players as one of their favorites on the annual PGA Tour schedule.

Editor's Picks #AskESPNCaddie -- Broken clubs and full bellies What happens to clubs broken by frustrated pros? And after the round, where's the best place to eat? ESPN.com's Michael Collins answers your burning questions in #AskESPNCaddie.

It's a no-nonsense course that's difficult without being tricked up and playable without yielding too many birdies.

What I found there recently is that the course is going to have a bit of a different look and feel this year.

Some bunkers were restored and there was some general maintenance to sort of ""clean up"" the course a little bit.

The biggest difference, though, will be the greens, all 18 of which were completely redone since last year's tournament.

It was a smart and necessary move -- one that will pay off in the long run. In the meantime, however, while the putting surfaces should be rolling perfectly smooth for putts, like most new greens, they have some extra bounce to them.

Approach shots that might have found the back of the green a year ago could carom into the awaiting rough behind it. Chip shots that might have checked could take an extra hop past the hole.

Now, these are some of the world's best golfers, not a bunch of media hacks during a Monday outing. After three days of practice around the restored greens, I fully expect them to have a clever grasp of just how different they're playing than in previous years.

All of which leads to my extraneous analysis.",[]

espn.com,,Janoris Jenkins move shows New York Giants ready to hit free agency,['Dan Graziano'],"Spending big money on a bunch of free agents to improve one of the league's worst rosters is not the New York Giants' preferred course of action. Like every NFL team, the Giants would prefer to build through the draft.

They've been unable to do that, however, and the result is three straight losing seasons, a coaching change and a roster that needs to find at least eight or nine new starters before the 2016 season begins. That can't all be fixed in one draft, so free agency it is. And the news with which the Giants began the day indicates they plan to go big.

Janoris Jenkins had 10 interceptions during his four seasons with the Rams. AP Photo/Billy Hurst

As Adam Schefter reported first thing Wednesday, the Giants are expected to reach an agreement with free-agent cornerback Janoris Jenkins, formerly of the Rams, when the market opens and deals can be finalized at 4 p.m. ET Wednesday. This will be a monster deal, in excess of $12 million per year, dwarfing the $7 million per year the Giants had to spend to land cornerback Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie in free agency just two years ago.

Moreover, the conversations I've had in recent days tell me the Giants also plan a major push for free-agent defensive end Olivier Vernon, who could cost $15 million a year, and are interested in defensive tackle Damon Harrison ($7 million per year?) and safety Rodney McLeod ($6 million to $7 million?). They also need offensive line help and, as ever, some linebackers.

Again, this is not the preferred method of piecing together a roster. But the Giants' roster must be pieced together one way or another, and with nearly $60 million in cap space available (before the signings of Jenkins and Jason Pierre-Paul), this is the way that's available to them at the moment.

As to Jenkins specifically: Hey, he's the best available option and the Giants have the cap space, so why not? He's 27 years old, gifted athletically and has a history of making big plays. He returned three interceptions for touchdowns as a rookie in 2012 and two more in 2014. He has a reputation as a bit of a gambler in coverage, but he improved in that area this past season. There are some off-field concerns dating back to his time in college, but there are plenty of players who outgrow those things.

Talented, with some warts. That's the best you can hope for when you're mining the free-agent market. Jenkins offers a ton of upside and could be a truly great player for the Giants if he irons out the aspects of his game that still need work. Obviously, the Giants are convinced his chances of doing that are high. We will all find out together whether they were right.

One person I spoke with at the NFL combine in Indianapolis a couple of weeks ago posed this question to me: ""Are they going to act like the Giants? Or are they going to act like people whose jobs are on the line?"" If the Giants really are prepared to spend like this in free agency, as it seems they are, it looks as if the answer may be the latter. Which would make it a wild ride, but obviously one that comes with no guarantees of success.",[]
espn.com,,Albert Pujols unlikely to reverse declining production at the plate,"['Jerry Crasnick', 'David Schoenfield', 'Stacey Gotsulias']","The good news this week from Los Angeles Angels camp is that Albert Pujols, coming off foot surgery in November, has already played and declared that, barring a setback, he'll be ready for Opening Day, at least to serve as the designated hitter. That puts him ahead of his original timetable, which estimated he would return five months after the surgery and likely miss Opening Day.

Who is Albert Pujols these days? We know he's an all-time great: He's 32nd all time in WAR, 21st among position players and 12th among position players since World War II. He also hit 40 home runs in 2015, his most since swatting 42 back in 2010. Those home runs, however, served to mask a hitter who remained in decline. Check out this trend: .462, .443, .414, .366, .343, .330, .324, .307.

Those are his on-base percentages since 2008. His batting averages share an almost similar straight decline: .357, .327, .312, .299, .285, .258. .272, .244.

Here's one way to visualize Pujols' decline as a hitter -- his hit charts from 2009, when he hit .327/.443/.658 and led the NL in home runs, OBP and slugging, and 2015, when he hit .244/.307/.480:

ESPN Stats & Info

ESPN Stats & Info

Pujols has always primarily been a pull hitter, but now, that's pretty much all he does; he pulled 39 of his 40 home runs in 2015. That approach kept his power numbers up, but the man who once sprayed doubles all over the field hit just 22 in 2015. In 2009, we see a dense collection of white dots in left field -- those are groundball base hits. We see fewer in 2015, as Pujols has become one of the easiest players in the majors to shift against. Back in 2009 during the pre-shift era, Pujols hit .278 on grounders; in 2015, that was down to .187.

We can also see Pujols' inability to cover as much of the plate as he once did:

ESPN Stats & Info

ESPN Stats & Info

Pujols' strength has been hitting the pitch up in the zone, but the changing strike zone and improved scouting reports have also worked against him. Opponents know he struggles with the low pitch, and now he sees more of them, according to data from ESPN Stats & Information:

Pitches in lower third (or below) of strike zone

2009: 37.5 percent

2015: 45.4 percent

Pitches in lower half (or below) of strike zone

2009: 50.4 percent

2015: 60.8 percent

Pitchers also go inside more often than they once did -- a sign that his bat speed isn't what it once was as they believe they can get fastballs in on his hands. And they also throw him more pitches in the strike zone: from 41.3 percent in 2009 to 48.4 percent in 2015. He simply isn't feared like he once was, a primary reason his walk rate also has declined. Pujols is still an excellent contact hitter with a low swing-and-miss rate, but he has become more prone to chasing pitches out of the zone, as well, another sign that he is forced to guess more often. Indeed, Angels fans have seen that patented Pujols at-bat: He rolls one over to third base or shortstop and -- head down -- heads off to first base for an easy out.

All this is a way of saying that while I hope the foot surgery produces a different Pujols in 2016, the indicators are that this is what he is at 36 years old: a one-dimensional slugger who can run into enough mistakes to launch some home runs.

In 2015, that still produced a decent amount of value: He was worth 2.6 offensive WAR, when 2.0 is about an average major leaguer. But if he hits .230 and has just 28 home runs instead of 40? Then we're talking about a below-average first baseman/designed hitter. And given the state of the rest of the Angels' offense surrounding Mike Trout, you wonder if this team will again struggle to score enough runs.",[]

I can tell by the sunburn, the new Cannondale in my garage, and the bandages on my arms and legs.

All eyes have been focused south of the equator, with the road season opening last week with the Tour de San Luis in Argentina and the Tour Down Under in, um, I forget.

I raced in San Luis, an event that's typically full of top European riders looking to start their season with a good result, only to get humbled by South Americans who are accustomed to the 100-plus degree heat. This year was no different, as the Colombians and Argentinians swept the podium and won four out of six stages.

The typical format of a stage is this: a small breakaway forms containing riders the WorldTour teams deem unthreatening; big teams control the pace to keep the breakaway within a few minutes; teams then chase down the breakaway near the end, with the sprinters battling it out for the stage win.

This year, the breakaways often proved too strong, or the WorldTour teams gave up after prematurely reaching their suffering quota, which is low in January.

We could tell by his hairy legs that world champion Peter Sagan wasn't motivated for field sprints in San Luis, which left most of the pace-setting to the Movistar team of overall favorite Nairo Quintana.

Editor's Picks Behind the scenes with Phil Gaimon and Team Cannondale in Argentina Phil Gaimon returned to the WorldTour at the Tour de San Luis, and documented Team Cannondale's ride through social media.

Nairo rode well, finishing third, but his brother and teammate, Dayer, was the revelation of the race, grabbing the overall win and striking fear into the heart of Chris Froome, who might now have double trouble to deal with from the Colombian brothers at this year's Tour de France.

The Tour Down Under was more predictable. With a higher-caliber field and WorldTour points up for grabs, top teams were more willing to suffer (and they all shaved their legs) .

Caleb Ewan proved the fastest in the bunch sprints, while Richie Porte, Jay McCarthy, and overall winner Simon Gerrans took the remaining stages. The surprise result there came from my Cannondale teammate Mike Woods, who showed he can ride with the best of them, finishing fifth overall in his WorldTour debut.

Pro cycling has been marred by an unusual number of crashes this month. Frequent pileups in San Luis left much of the field (including yours truly) covered in gauze, and a car drove head-on into the group at Giant-Alpecin's training camp, leaving a handful of riders seriously injured.

As the dust settles, the road peloton heads for the Mideast for the Tours of Qatar and Oman, where the heat will be about the same, the climbs will be traded for crosswinds, and the big Belgians will have their battle for dominance.

Heat isn't a problem in cyclocross, where the season is coming to a climax. Stephen Hyde threatened to unseat Jeremy Powers' dominance in the U.S., besting him in a couple events leading up to the national championships, but Powers used his experience to put together a strong, nearly-flawless ride for a third straight national title.

Powers has his eyes on a Top-10 finish at the world championships at the end of January, where 21-year-old Mathieu van der Poel will be the man-child to watch after dominating the last few World Cup events.

As for me, the recent snow didn't keep me from getting back to Los Angeles, where I'll rest and heal before moving to Spain for the rest of the season. Adios for now.",[]
espn.com,,"Daily Fantasy Basketball: Building blocks, sleepers for March 9","['Renee Miller', 'Tom Carpenter', 'Joe Kaiser', 'Jim Mccormick', 'Espn Com Staff', 'Leo Howell']","As part of ESPN Fantasy's efforts to provide daily fantasy gamers intel on whom to target in DFS, our fantasy basketball experts are here to show you which players they are building their teams around and which sleepers they are taking fliers on. Today's panel features picks from Joe Kaiser, Renee Miller, Jungkyu Lee, Cynthia Frelund and Dailyfantasybootcamp.com's Al Zeidenfeld.

Building block

Joe Kaiser: Giannis Antetokounmpo, SF, Milwaukee Bucks

Antetokounmpo is a walking triple-double these days; over the past 10 games, he has averaged 19.1 points, 10.3 rebounds and 7.8 assists to go along with 1.9 steals and 2 blocks. Even still, he remains priced below $10,000 on both DraftKings and FanDuel. Get him in your lineups when the Bucks take on Miami tonight.

Renee Miller: JaMychal Green, PF, Memphis Grizzlies

With so many high-paced, potentially high-scoring games featuring the league's best players and teams tonight, you'll need to save big somewhere. While Green may look like a point-chasing pick coming off his 16-point, 10-rebound, 6-assist, 2-block, 4-steal game Monday night at Cleveland when he played 37 minutes and Memphis had no one else available, he has very real merits. I don't necessarily expect another 50-fantasy-point effort tonight, but the Grizzlies are still very shorthanded in the frontcourt and the matchup with Boston is one I often target in DFS. A cheap player with upside in a generous positional matchup is easy to lock into all lineups tonight.

Jungkyu Lee: Chris Paul, PG, Los Angeles Clippers

Consider that CP3 is averaging 26.5 points, 11.5 assists and 4.5 rebounds in the two games against the Thunder this season. Then consider that Paul has raised his per-game averages to 21.8 points and 10.2 assists since Blake Griffin's injury back in December on a 28.3 percent usage rate, which would be a career-high. Then consider the Clippers are only 1.5 games behind the Thunder, who are reeling a bit and have given up the fourth-most points per 100 possessions since the All-Star break. Paul will do everything in his power to will the Clippers to a victory tonight. Paul should be cheaper than the top options in Stephen Curry and Russell Westbrook tonight at the point guard position. I take my chances on CP3 and save a few bucks here.

Cynthia Frelund: Green

Zach Randolph is listed doubtful as of 1 p.m. ET, and Chris Anderson has already been ruled out. Do I think Green will play for 37 minutes again like he did on Monday vs. Cleveland? Not guaranteeing that. But against the Celtics, who are in the bottom third in terms of giving up the most points to power forwards, I think he's a great addition to your low-cost-options list. For context, in his last 10 games, he's averaging 22.8 MPG, 5.1 RPG and 9.7 PPG, and I have him projected for 28 minutes tonight. Ahem, don't forget to consider Mario Chalmers as well (with Mike Conley out), though Boston is much better at limiting the production of point guards on the season.

Dailyfantasybootcamp.com's Al Zeidenfeld: Alex Len, C, Phoenix Suns

The price just isn't rising fast enough and the production is still steady, and once again Len is going to be a player I build around tonight. Since the shift in offensive strategy to make Len the focal point, he's seen a significant boost in every DFS-relevant category and metric over the past five games: Len's uptick in production MPG PPG FGA RPG REB% USG% *FF per minute Last 5 games 35.7 20.4 14.8 14.4 20.9 28.2 1.27 First 54 games 19.4 7.5 6.3 6.4 17.8 19.2 1.03 *Fantasy points per minute for DrafKings

The chance for him to sustain this level of play is very realistic based on his new playing time, rebounding ability and amount of shots he's getting on offense. The price is still too low, and until that changes, I'll be on Len.

Sleeper pick

Joe Kaiser: Isaiah Thomas, PG, Boston Celtics

On a night with so many other top-tier point guards, it will be easy for Thomas to get lost in the shuffle. He shouldnt, though. The first-time All-Star went for 35 points and 8 assists the last time Boston faced Memphis, and tonight the Grizzlies will be without guard Mike Conley. Consider Thomas if youre looking to avoid paying top dollar at point guard while still getting a high-ceiling player.

Renee Miller: Andre Drummond, C, Detroit Pistons

Detroit is the league's fourth-best rebounding team with a 51.9 percent rebounding rate, while Dallas ranks 26th in that category. That discrepancy is largely due to Drummond, who leads the league with 15.1 boards per game. He should take full advantage of a Mavericks frontcourt that has been generous all season; Dallas has allowed the second-most fantasy points to opposing centers over the last five games on both sites. If Hassan Whiteside doesn't play tonight, Drummond's ownership might rise, but otherwise there are enough quality center options to distract from the fairly unpopular (in DFS circles) Drummond.

Jungkyu Lee: Jerryd Bayless, PG, Milwaukee Bucks

Even with a tough matchup against the Heat, neither DFS sites have adjusted Bayless' value after Michael Carter-Williams' season-ending injury. Bayless is once again a very affordable option to keep roster flexibility and allows you to have multiple expensive players. Since MCW's injury, Bayless has averaged 33 MPG while posting 13.0 PPG, 3.0 RPG, 3.0 APG and 2.4 3-pointers. I think those numbers are the floor to what Bayless can do on a nightly basis. Keep rolling with him until the sites pick up on his production.

Cynthia Frelund: Carmelo Anthony, SF, New York Knicks

There is no shortage of great options at small forward tonight. The reason I think Melo may get overlooked is that the Knicks have the 13th-highest projected team total, per Sportsbook.ag, and Melo is the fourth-highest priced pick on either site. He's a bit more affordable on DraftKings, though. This is a pace up game for the Knicks (25th in pace), and the Suns are right near the bottom of the league in terms of allowing small forwards to score. Melo could be a great sneaky source of value tonight, and for context, I have him projected to over-perform his averages of 38.2 MPG, 8.8 RPG, 4.6 APG and 24.0 PPG over the past 10 games.

Dailyfantasybootcamp.com's Al Zeidenfeld: Devin Booker, SG, Phoenix Suns

Over the same time frame that we've seen Alex Len's ascension, Booker has very quietly put up some astounding numbers. While Booker's peripheral stats aren't going to be as good as Len's, making him a bit riskier as a fantasy play, his minutes (36.3) and shots attempted (15.5) per game have risen significantly and been consistent for the past two weeks. The salary has come all the way to $5,300 on DrafKings ($5,700 on FanDuel), which will make some buyers hesitant -- as he'll need to top 30 points to satisfy value -- but this is a player on the rise, averaging 39.9 fantasy points on DraftKings the past three games with the low game being 29. Thirty-five minutes and 15 shots both seem like very reasonable targets tonight, the matchup vs. the Knicks looks to be both high-scoring and competitive, and with so many other higher-profile targets at shooting guard, Booker makes for a high-ceiling tournament play at a low-ownership level.",[]

espn.com,,Baltimore Orioles primed to hit even more home runs in 2016 season,"['Jerry Crasnick', 'David Schoenfield', 'Stacey Gotsulias']","The Baltimore Orioles, who lust after home runs like the Weinstein brothers go after an Oscar, signed another slugger by agreeing with Pedro Alvarez on a reportedly one-year, $5.75 million contract.

Alvarez, bumped out of Pittsburgh due to his lousy defense at third base and then first base, won't have to worry about that with the Orioles, with whom he presumably slots in at the DH spot, with Mark Trumbo moving to fill a hole in right field. Overall, it's a minor upgrade for the Orioles and maybe worth a win or two. Alvarez will provide more offense than the projected right-field combo of Ryan Flaherty and Nolan Reimold, though Trumbo's defensive deficiencies will give some of that back.

Here's what interesting: How many home runs will the Orioles hit in 2016? They hit 217 in 2015, which ranked third in the majors behind the Blue Jays (232) and Astros (230). They led the AL in 2014 with 211 -- 34 more than the Blue Jays -- and led in 2013 with 2012, 24 more than the Mariners. What if all the regulars matched their career highs in home runs? Let's look:

LF Hyun Soo Kim: 17 (ZiPS projection)

3B Manny Machado: 35 (2015)

1B Chris Davis: 53 (2013)

CF Adam Jones: 33 (2013)

DH Pedro Alvarez: 36 (2013)

RF Mark Trumbo: 34 (2013)

C Matt Wieters: 23 (2012)

SS J.J. Hardy: 30 (2011)

2B Jonathan Schoop: 16 (2014)

Total: 277. That would break the major league record of 264, set by the 1997 Mariners (Ken Griffey Jr. led the way with 56). Of course, the bench would chip in a few more homers, so let's add 23 to give the Orioles an even 300 home runs.

Now let's do this: What if they scored runs at the same ratio to home runs as they did in 2015?

2015: 217 home runs, 713 runs = 3.28 runs per home run

2016: 300 home runs x 3.28 runs per homer = 984 runs

Of course, I don't know if that ratio holds up. The more home runs you hit, the more likely more of them are solo home runs, so the ratio of runs scored goes down (unless you're adding more hits and walks). But we're just having fun with this, so we'll stick with it. Now, 984 runs is a lot of runs. Only two teams in recent history -- the 1999 Indians and the 1996 Mariners -- have reached that mark, and those teams played in a higher offensive era with more hits, more walks and fewer strikeouts than the Orioles.

Plus, let's be realistic: All the Orioles aren't going to reach their career highs. Hardy, for example, once hit 30 home runs but has just 17 over the past two seasons. But let's say the Orioles hit 260 home runs. Using our same scale, we get 852 runs. Hey, that's still a lot of runs! The Blue Jays scored 891 last year, but the No. 2 team in the AL was the Yankees with 764.

The Orioles allowed 693 runs last year. If they score 852 and allow the same number of runs, we'd project a win-loss record of 97-65. So there you go, Orioles fans. Hit 260 home runs, and maintain the same run prevention, and you'll win the AL East.",[]

Pound, chair of the World Anti-Doping Agency's independent commission, speaking at the Tackling Doping in Sport conference in London on Wednesday, said: ""Even with the presence of credible evidence, there was, and to some extent there still is a wall of denial.

""Russia, in the sport of athletics, is on the outside trying to get back in. The onus is on it to justify any readmission.

""It is also clear that opinion is divided on the matter of readmission. The Russians seem to assume that the controversy will disappear and there should be no question regarding their participation in Rio. No question.

""In other parts of the sporting world there is great resistance to any fast-track solution.""

Pound, who thought it was ""unlikely"" that the suspension of track and field athletes would be extended to other sports in Russia, added: ""We said [to the Russian athletics federation] 'here are some of the findings you are going to be facing. If you want to get back in you have got a steep hill to climb, but if you devote all of your resources and attention to solving the problem instead of solving the report you have got a chance to do it in time for Rio'.

""I don't think they are devoting all their time and energy to where they should be to getting, or where they ought to be. They really have got to address the issues.

""It is a considerable hurdle for them and if the two organisations [WADA and the IAAF] are not satisfied that the clean competitors of the Games are protected then my guess is that they may not make it back for Rio.""

The two-day Tackling Doping in Sport conference is taking place under the backdrop of five-time grand slam winner Maria Sharapova's positive test for a banned substance at this year's Australian Open tennis tournament.

""The fact of the matter is right now Russian athletics is suspended,"" Pound added. ""Russia has to explain to Russians why it is that their track and field team may not be in Rio. Nobody is going to buy that it is a western plot.

""One of the accusations early on was that the reason we were so tough on Russia is that the whistle-blowers we trying to seek refugee status in Canada. It's absolute nonsense.""

Meanwhile, WADA president Sir Craig Reedie called for greater funding from sports to tackle the issue of doping.

""Here we are awash with money and I am perplexed that the sport movement is reluctant to make the investment needed to protect clean sport,"" Reedie said.

""Clearly we have a lot to do. Will doping disappear in time? Of course it cannot be eradicated entirely because it is in some people's nature to cheat, but we can do our level best to reduce doping and make the risk outweigh the reward.

""We want to create a healthy sporting environment where doping is not an option.""",[]
espn.com,,"Backlash against Olympics, IOC demands is about much more than Rio woes","['Johnette Howard', 'Espn Staff', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Adriana Terrazas', 'Bonnie D']","Despite cleanup promises, waters at the site of the 2016 Summer Olympics are still contaminated by bacteria and viruses. Tom Farrey has the latest from Rio de Janeiro. (6:50)

Even before organizers of the Rio de Janeiro Summer Games were contending with the Zika virus outbreak and heavy criticism about how the city is dealing with its polluted waters, the International Olympic Committee was facing a growing mood shift about the Olympics as an institution that Rio's widely publicized difficulties will only feed.

More and more cities have already concluded it just doesn't make sense to undertake the risk or cost of hosting the Olympics right now.

Editor's Picks OTL: The debris in Rio's waters Rio de Janeiro's bid for the Summer Games featured an official commitment to cleaner waters. But with less than six months to go, trash and contamination continue to lurk.

The three weeks when the Olympic athletes actually compete still reliably deliver their wondrous magic. And to be fair to Rio, alarmist talk seems to surface before nearly every Olympics. Then the Games come off just fine.

But even those two factors aren't enough anymore to rescue the International Olympic Committee's leadership from criticism that the Games have become too ponderous and expensive to succeed -- at least as they are presently bid out, conceived and run. And the IOC 's history of imperialistic demands and puffery -- such as its 7,000-page bid manual for host cities that addresses details down to when aperitifs or ""cakes of the season"" are customarily served -- doesn't acquit the 100-member IOC leadership of the charges.

""The IOC is a classic oligarchy that's fiddling while the Olympics burn,"" says John Rennie Short, a professor of public policy at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who has written 38 books on globalization and urban issues. ""The IOC has a monopoly with little incentive to change. They reap nearly all the benefits while insisting their host cities and governments literally sign documents to bear all the cost and risk. So the whole thing was always a bit of a cabal to begin with anyway, but we didn't mind so much when the cabal was at least working.""

Robert Livingstone, an Olympic historian and producer for Gamesbids.com, says things have gone beyond the tipping point.

After Oslo dropped out of the race to host the 2022 Winter Games, only two of the six cities that made bids remained in the running. Solum Stian Lysberg/Getty Images

""The $41 billion or more that Sochi spent is the price tag that scares everybody,"" he says. ""The IOC's whole Agenda 2020 -- the reforms that came out in 2014 citing sustainability, leaving a legacy, things like that -- was their response. But whether the IOC backs up that plan is another question. ... The IOC pushed so far, it finally went too far, and that's why people got so angry.""

During the bidding process for the 2022 Winter Games, five cities that expressed interest in bidding abandoned their candidacies because voters or the government wouldn't accept the financial risk. Many of them also blamed the IOC's demands and even ""arrogance."" Jeff Ruffolo, an American who helped Beijing operate the 2008 Summer Games and make its 2022 bid successful, called the bidding process ""a joke.""

""Everybody's laughing about it except for the people in Lausanne,"" Ruffolo told the Guardian, referring to the IOC's headquarters in Switzerland. ""They don't realize they are riding a dead horse.""

The specter of many of the world's major cities balking at chasing the Olympics was prophesized back in 2002, when then-IOC president Jacques Rogge acknowledged a ""need to streamline costs and scale down the Games so the host cities are not limited to wealthy metropolises. The scale of the Games is a threat to their quality.""

That sounded encouraging. Then the world saw Athens spend $15 billion on the 2004 Summer Games, which is blamed for helping push Greece into economic crisis. Then Beijing spent a reported $41 billion in 2008 and, in a scene repeated elsewhere, many of its white-elephant Olympic venues have become "" ruin porn."" London ran up a $15 billion cost overrun in 2012. Now Tokyo, host of the 2020 Summer Games, has already decided it can't afford the stadium that was a centerpiece of its bid. The plans were scrapped in July amid howls of protest.

""Does the IOC care?"" Short asks. ""What's happened is a classic lesson from the global financial crisis: If you're not responsible for risk, you do stupid things. But many cities are recalculating. That could finally be the crunch.""

There is indeed snowballing in the sense that the Games are more broken than ever, and blame lies with the IOC leadership's stewardship.

Those perceptions only accelerated more when the mass withdrawals from the 2022 Winter Games bidding left the IOC with a choice between only Almaty, Kazakhstan, and a return to Beijing, which will have to manufacture massive amounts of snow and is as far as 90 miles from the mountains that will host events. What do the former Soviet Republic and China have in common?

""They're two of the worst places for human rights in the world,"" Short says. ""A lot of European cities are having a hard time getting the choice to bid on the Games past voters. Boston also said no. So what you're left with are countries desperate for recognition and a boost in prestige. Or cities from nondemocratic, totalitarian countries where there are no voter referendums.""

One of the most surprising defections from the 2022 bidding was Oslo. Norwegian government officials admitted afterward they had many soul-searching discussions about whether they would be delivering a grievous blow to the Olympic movement if their sports-mad nation -- the country with the most Winter Games medals ever won and where the 1994 Lillehammer Games were a soaring critical and athletic success -- joined the exodus.

""I fear for the future of the Winter Olympics, I really do,"" said Norwegian lawmaker Svein Harberg, head of the committee that led the debate on abandoning the bid.

""What we do advocate is that cities considering a bid have a real pros-and-cons conversation. And it is definitely a trend that when cities have that debate, they decide it's just not worth it. The cost is high and risk almost limitless."" Chris Dempsey, co-chair of No Boston Olympics

So what tipped the Norwegians' resolve?

""Norway is a rich country, but we don't want to spend money on wrong things, like satisfying the crazy demands from IOC apparatchiks,"" said Frithjof Jacobsen, chief political commentator for Norwegian newspaper VG.

The criticism is a familiar refrain.

And yet, rather than acknowledge that the Norwegians' reasons echoed concerns voiced in New York and Stockholm, Chicago and Istanbul, Boston and Hamburg, IOC president Thomas Bach scoffed at critics and suggested they distort facts. He pointed to the IOC's new long-term contracts with sponsors and media companies, including its record $7.75 billion deal with NBC for U.S. TV rights.

""The image is very positive,"" Bach insisted. ""Nobody would enter into such kind of agreements if there would be a doubt on the image.""

Chris Dempsey, co-chair of the No Boston Olympics effort, disagrees.

After Dempsey's group helped turn public opinion against Boston's bid for the 2024 Summer Games, activists in Hamburg reached out and paid for him and his colleagues to travel to Germany to share tips. A month later, Reuters reported that German officials were shocked when citizens there voted down a December referendum about Hamburg's 2024 bid. Within just the past few weeks, opponents of bids in Rome and Budapest have reached out to Dempsey too.

""We want to be clear that we're not saying no city should host the Olympics,"" Dempsey stresses. ""What we do advocate is that cities considering a bid have a real pros-and-cons conversation. And it is definitely a trend that when cities have that debate, they decide it's just not worth it. The cost is high and risk almost limitless.""

It's too soon to call it a full-blown ""Kill the Olympics"" movement.

For now, it's more of a ""Not in My Backyard"" backlash. And there's a search for solutions.

One notable exception amid all the pessimism is Los Angeles, which is enthusiastically chasing the 2024 Summer Games.

Los Angeles is often credited for ""saving"" the Olympics once by stepping in to host the 1984 Summer Games and notching a still unheard-of operating surplus of $225 million. This time around, the Southern California Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games boasts that its plan to use the region's existing facilities, infrastructure and housing can be a model for how future Games are awarded and run. And it hasn't been a hard sell locally.

A poll released last week by the Center for the Study of Los Angeles at Loyola Marymount University found 88 percent of Angelenos support L.A. hosting the Games again.

""With 97 percent of the world-class venues in our Games Plan already built or planned as permanent facilities ... we're able to keep the costs low,"" LA 2024 chief executive officer Gene Sykes wrote in an email to ESPN.com. ""The Games must serve our city for generations to come, not for just one month in 2024. That's Olympic legacy in action -- not in theory.""

But Short, in an op-ed piece for The Washington Post, advocates a more radical approach. It's a fresh, somewhat utopian twist on an old idea that never launched and isn't under serious discussion now: staging the Summer Games in a permanent site near Athens, the ancestral home of the Olympics. Short proposes making the IOC pay -- for a change -- for the construction, facility maintenance and staging of the Games at a green, sustainably built, multivenue complex on one of Greek's many islands and that it be used for other cultural and athletic purposes year-round.

""I don't think it's that off the wall,"" Short says with a laugh.

Not any more than believing the IOC can stay as it is.",[]

I didn't ask if this caddie is part of the lawsuit; to me, it doesn't matter because every caddie has an opinion on it regardless. And wait until you read where this caddie ranks the Copperhead Course, host of this week's Valspar Championship.

Finally, we close with two of my favorite things: the mental part of caddying and food. Enjoy!

Collins: The caddie lawsuit appeal gets filed Monday, then an apparent meeting with the tour and a caddie rep gets cancelled. Thoughts?

Caddie: Well, I was 50-50 on whether they would sit down after the appeal was filed. But [the tour] knew that [the caddies] were appealing it, and they wanted to talk. It's not like [the caddies] went to them. [The tour] reached out to [the caddies] ... I think the outcome [of the appeal] will be pretty good [for the caddies].

Collins: Let's talk about the Copperhead Course. For people who've never been there, what should they know? What makes this course special?

Caddie: It's got elevation changes. All the other golf courses [in Florida on tour] are flat, so I think that's probably the biggest thing. You've got key holes that are very difficult to get through ... for example the Snake Pit. [It's] very similar to the Bear Trap [at the Honda Classic]. But not as difficult as the Bear Trap ... When you get on 16 with a 1-or-2 shot lead, you're definitely thinking, ""I got to get this ball in the fairway"" ... And the wind is usually blowing 15-20 here, so it's one of my favorite golf courses in the state.

Collins: Why does this tournament always seem to have the weakest field of the Florida swing?

Caddie: You got Nicklaus doing PGA National [for the Honda Classic]. And it's right before Doral, which is a WGC event, so they always get a strong [showing], especially with the European Tour players. And then you got Arnold [Palmer's event], so I know you know everyone wants to play Arnold's Bay Hill and support his tournament. And then you have Innisbrook, which is kind of like the ugly stepchild! But you know what? Honestly to me it's the best of the four courses. So you still get good players [to] show up here time in and time out. You know they did a little rehab to the golf course. Not much but ... the greens are back to their original sizes.

Collins: What about this course keeps the winning score so high?

Caddie: We got rough around the greens and off the fairways, [so] you get into small greens that are usually hard with swirling winds ... That'll contribute to keeping scores not as low as normal. And normally we don't have rough on the PGA Tour.

The golf course is set up for bombers. It's set up for the bombers almost every week. Unless you get a golf course like this or Hilton Head [or] Colonial ... you know, where they're a little bit handicapped [for land]. But normally bombers take out driver, hit it everywhere, and wedge it on the green. This golf course? Not so much.

Collins: What's the hardest part about caddying this week?

Caddie: The mental aspect.

Collins: Okay, so which part? Tee ball, second shots or around the greens?

Caddie: Well, what about if [you pro is] struggling at home with his wife? There could be other things ... you're thinking maybe [it's] on the golf course, but what about things at home or maybe a friend is sick? What about family matters? There's so many different things, so players can be a little temperamental.

Collins: Wow, great answer. So out of all those things ... Most challenging thing for the caddie to deal with mentally?

Caddie: Mentally? Honestly, it's a psychology game and when I am dealing with that, I get my player off that thought process. I talk about all the positive things in his life to get him away from the negative. So let's say he struggling with his girlfriend, or his wife, or his dad is sick or something like that. I talk about all the great things in his life. Get his mind in the happy place. Just like that movie ""Happy Gilmore.""

""Go to your happy place."" If you have your mind in a happy place, usually, happy players play the best.

Collins: [Sarcastically] It's amazing how that happens!

Caddie: [Also sarcastically] Isn't it? How many players do you see playing bad with a sourpuss face on? The guys that are smiling and enjoying themselves are usually the guys that play the best ... In all sports, the guys that are happy are usually playing their best ... I'm a firm believer.

If I look at all the great athletes over time, they enjoyed what they're doing. So if a player's mind is not in the right place, your job is to get the player's mind in the right place ... I think the best caddies on tour are the one to have a great relationship with their players [and] that know the right things to tell him to get their mind in the right spot. Keep their mind out of whatever negativity is going on in their life.

Collins: Where's ""the spot"" this week?

Caddie: Gino's Pizza!

Collins: How funny is it that? If you asked a caddie that question in 1990, they probably give you the name of a strip club or a dive bar. So Gino's has good Italian food?

Caddie: Pizza! N.Y. style pizza. You don't go to a steakhouse and order fish, do ya?! I don't eat bad pizza so ... Anyone who eats with a fork and a knife to cut a pizza? puh-lees! They can go.

In a surprise announcement, two-time Olympian Ryan Hall has said he is retiring from professional running just four weeks ahead of the U.S. Olympic Trials Marathon in Los Angeles.

Hall cited chronically low testosterone levels as the reason in a New York Times story announcing the decision.

The 33-year-old Hall, who nine years ago set a still-standing American record of 59:43 at the Armco Houston Half Marathon, where his wife Sara will compete this Sunday, made the announcement in a New York Times story. The Halls have been sponsored by the shoe and apparel brand Asics since graduating from Stanford University in 2005.

The last four years certainly have been very trying, Hall admitted to Competitor last October.

The last Olympic Trials cost me four years of struggle as I got plantar fasciitis about a month before the trials and ran through the trials with it. Then I trained for the Olympics with plantar fasciitis, which resulted in my stride changing and an endless chain of injury after injury.

Hall, who won the 2008 U.S. Olympic Trials Marathon in New York in an event-record time of 2:09:02 and finished second to Meb Keflezighi at the 2012 Trials in Houston, dropped out of the 2012 Olympic Marathon with a hamstring injury. Laden with injuries and illness in recent years, Hall hasnt finished a marathon since placing 20th at Boston in 2014, where he ran 2:17:50.

(2:34)

GAINESVILLE, Fla. -- Not every Southeastern Conference coach is condemning Michigan and Jim Harbaugh for spending spring break in the Sunshine State.

Florida's Jim McElwain, who probably had as much to lose as anyone, as the Wolverines practiced just a few hours south of Gainesville and squarely in the Gators' recruiting footprint, actually praised Harbaugh for ""pressing the envelopes.""

""I kind of look it as more power to him,"" McElwain said Tuesday, the day before the Gators opened spring practice. ""It's totally legal. He's not doing anything that's illegal. He's pressing the envelopes. He's putting their name in the paper every day. And, you know, that's cool. I mean, I'd come to Florida, too.

""There are great players here, right? There's a reason every school in the country comes here and recruits. So I think for them it's trying to gain an edge and give them an opportunity to practice in great weather. I don't plan on taking ours to Michigan. I'm all for what he's doing.""

Michigan spent spring break at IMG Academy, a one-of-a-kind trip that might never be allowed again in college football. Harbaugh's traveling road show drew the ire of the Southeastern Conference and the Atlantic Coast Conference, and the NCAA president sounded less than thrilled with the trip.

SEC commissioner Greg Sankey and ACC commissioner John Swofford said that kind of trip should be banned because it falls during spring break, when players usually are off. NCAA President Mark Emmert questioned whether the trip was in the spirit of the current movement toward giving players more time off and said the question over whether Harbaugh and other coaches can make trips like this in the future is a matter before the NCAA's football oversight committee.

Michigan paid IMG Academy to use its facilities for the week and used its 5,000-seat stadium for the final practice.

Nearly every SEC coach has weighed in on the topic. Arkansas' Bret Bielema and Tennessee's Butch Jones joked about attending Michigan's open practice. Georgia's Kirby Smart said Harbaugh is ""obviously trying to gain a competitive advantage,"" and Mississippi's Hugh Freeze questioned the move by saying he's ""not sure how a college coach can be on a high school campus during a quiet [recruiting] period.""

Alabama's Nick Saban has been among the most vocal.

""If we're all going to travel all over the country to have satellite camps, you know, how ridiculous is that?"" Saban said. ""We're not allowed to go to all-star games, but now we're going to have satellite camps all over the country. It doesn't really make sense.""

McElwain, who was admittedly embarrassed by his team's 41-7 loss to Michigan in the Citrus Bowl in January, stayed out of the fray.

He said he held out-of-town practices while coaching at Eastern Washington and at Montana State. But he has no plans for the Gators to work outside of Gainesville.

""I know the administration would hate to see the budget cost,"" McElwain said. ""So I'm not asking for it.""",[]

espn.com,,Mo Farah wants to take family to Rio Olympics despite Zika virus threat,"['Sue Mott', 'One Naci N', 'Gordon Simpson', 'Pa Sport', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Bonnie D', 'Wayne Drehs', 'Espn Staff', 'Johnette Howard', 'Jim Caple']","Mo Farah insists he will not let the threat of the Zika virus rob him of another golden Olympic moment with his family.

The double London 2012 champion is already targeting another glittering haul as he closes in on this year's Rio games.

However, the build-up to the event has been overshadowed by the emergence of the Zika outbreak.

According to reports, Farah's Team GB colleague Greg Rutherford has decided against taking his family to Brazil unless the emerging infection can be brought under control.

But Farah still holds fond memories of his 10,000m win four years ago when wife Tania and step-daughter Rihanna joined him on the track to celebrate in front of a delighted home crowd and is desperate to recreate that moment in Rio.

The 32-year-old -- speaking in Glasgow ahead of the city's Indoor Grand Prix on Saturday -- said: ""For me, the Olympics is where it is at. I want to have that moment for my family no matter what.

""I'm quite excited. In London one of the best things ever was having my family on the track. Seeing my wife and daughter there was incredible.

""I believe they are part of me and will be there again. I'm not even thinking about anything like [the Zika virus]. I want them there and that's it.""

While Farah's family are certain to be travelling to South America, the odds of Kenya's athletes following them appear less than certain.

IAAF preseident Lord Coe says he is ready to ban the African nation from this year's Olympics after its athletics federation was declared non-compliant with the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) code.

And Farah - who has been forced to deny links to drugs in the past year following BBC Panorama allegations that his coach Alberto Salazar was behind a secret doping programme in the United States - has urged athletics chiefs to take a tough stance against countries found to have broken rules.

""It's not a nice thing obviously but certain countries [like Britain] do the right thing,"" he said. ""If they [Kenya] can't follow the rules as a county then you have to set an example.

""For us, British athletes and other countries, we have rules and I wish they [the Kenyans] could follow those rules.""

Asked if competing without the Kenyans - whose athletes include some of Farah's main long-distance rivals like Geoffrey Kamworor, Paul Kipngetich Tanui and Bitan Karoki - would devalue the Rio Olympics, he said: ""For me definitely. If you don't have Kenya there it makes things easier for me, which is great.

""But at the same time, you don't want to wish anything like that on anybody who hasn't done anything wrong but as a country they have to follow that rules. If they can't then tough on them.""

Farah is set to compete in the 3,000 metres when he takes to the Emirates Arena track in Glasgow this weekend.

And with just seven months to go until Rio, he hopes to use the race as a platform for further success in the summer.

The five time-world champion said: ""It is every athlete's dream to go to an Olympics and do well. Obviously 2012 was a big, big year. It changed my career after I managed to come away with two gold medals in my home town in front of 80,000 people.

""And that's what keeps me going every day. Rio is not too far away now and I'm quite excited. It starts here in Glasgow now. This is the road to Rio.

""I've been training in Ethiopia for the last six weeks up at 10,000ft in some pretty nice weather. Training has gone pretty well and I've managed to get a lot of miles into my legs.

""I'm in similar shape to how I was last year. If you compare the times I was running last year to the ones I was coming up with during the training camp, it's kind of similar.

""So I think I'm in pretty good shape. I definitely want to get a good result tomorrow and then march on towards Rio.""",[]

espn.com,,Frampton ordered to defend against Rigondeaux,['Dan Rafael'],"Nigel Collins, Brian Campbell and Todd Grisham of Making The Rounds look at the talent-rich junior featherweight and featherweight divisions and ponder where Guillermo Rigondeaux fits in. (3:32)

After Carl Frampton outpointed Scott Quigg on Saturday to unify two junior featherweight world titles, Frampton (22-0, 14 KOs) expressed interest in a possible move up to featherweight to challenge titleholder Leo Santa Cruz (32-0-1, 18 KOs), who knocked out former junior featherweight titlist Kiko Martinez an few hours later in Anaheim, California.

Santa Cruz-Frampton would probably be a very good fight and one that would attract a lot of attention on both sides of the pond.

However, should Frampton elect to remain at junior featherweight and hang on to both of his belts he will have to next face former titleholder Guillermo Rigondeaux, who was stripped of two title belts for inactivity. However, the WBA said he would be first in line to be the mandatory challenger for its belt following Frampton-Quigg.

So as long as Rigondeaux (16-0, 10 KOs) defeats massive underdog James Jazza Dickens (21-1, 6 KOs) in a scheduled 10-round fight at the Echo Arena in Dickens hometown of Liverpool, England, on March 12, Rigondeaux will be next up for Frampton.

The WBA said the fight is due by July 27 and if they cant make a deal, a purse bid will be ordered. Frampton, however, could relinquish the WBA belt and go on defending the IBF version that he has held since September 2014. Just a few days removed from the big win against Quigg, Frampton and his team have not yet made a decision, not to mention that Rigondeaux still has to win next week.",[]

Sabado en Nueva York

Terence Crawford KOT5 Hank Lundy

Retiene un titulo de peso junior welter

Records: Crawford (28-0, 20 KO); Lundy (26-6-1, 13 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Lo que Crawford necesita es un oponente de elite dispuesto a subir al ring con el, porque mientras siga enfrentando a hombres mas pequenos o adversarios de nivel B -- como Lundy -- no va a perder en el corto plazo. Dominara ese tipo de oponentes, tal como lo hizo cuando gano un cinturon de peso welter junior vacante por nocaut ante Thomas Dulorme el pasado mes de abril. Al igual que hizo cuando desgarro a Dierry Jean en su primera defensa en octubre. Y al igual que lo hizo con Lundy en su defensa No. 2 despues de que le tomo cerca de una ronda encontrar su ritmo.

Una vez que Crawford hizo eso, el juego habia terminado para Lundy, cuyo primer intento para conseguir un titulo mundial termino violentamente y con sangre en la cara tras un corte sobre su ojo derecho.

Lundy, el boxeador del ano 2014 y ex campeon mundial de peso ligero, fue finalista para quedarse con una pelea el 9 de abril con la estrella de peso welter, Manny Pacquiao, que habria bajado de peso para luchar por el cinturon de Crawford. Pero Pacquiao opto por enfrentar a Timothy Bradley Jr., buen amigo de Crawford, por tercera vez. Eso dejo a Crawford, de 28 anos y de Omaha, frente a Lundy, de 32 anos y de Filadelfia, pero solo despues de que otros oponentes mas respetados rechazaron la pelea. Lundy es un boxeador honesto. El siempre viene a pelear, por lo general esta en buena condicion fisica y seguro que puede hablar demas. Y lo cierto es que algunos de los comentarios molestaron tanto a Crawford en la conferencia de prensa final dos dias antes de la pelea que este ultimo termino empujando a Lundy.

Asi que Lundy hizo una promocion interesante de la pelea, pero la clase quedo en evidencia una vez que la campana sono frente al lleno total de 5,092. Lundy tuvo cierto exito en la primera ronda, pero luego todo fue de Crawford, que estaba siendo ovacionado por un gran contingente de fans que hicieron el viaje al Theater del Madison Square Garden para el evento principal de HBO.

Crawford, mas grande, mas fuerte y mas alto, mas o menos hizo lo que quiso. Su jab fue potente y preciso, y Lundy se esforzo para aterrizar algo de calidad. En general, Crawford aterrizo 89 de 247 golpes y Lundy conecto 47 de 211 golpes, de acuerdo con las estadisticas de CompuBox.

Crawford, quien gano $ 1.21 millones, mientras que Lundy recibio solo $ 150,000, tuvo el control en el quinto asalto cuando lastimo gravemente a Lundy con una derecha, lo dejo contra las cuerdas con una izquierda y lo derribo con una acumulacion de disparos. Lundy tiene corazon y vencio el conteo, pero Crawford se le fue encima y cuando sacudio a Lundy de nuevo con una derecha, el arbitro Steve Willis salto entre ellos para terminar el combate a los 2 minutos, 9 segundos. Fue una actuacion estelar de Crawford, que necesita un rival mas amenazador para hacer que sus intenciones de liderar en la libra-por-libra tengan peso. Podria tener una prueba fuerte este verano. El promotor de Top Rank, Bob Arum, dijo que volvera a pelear en junio o julio, probablemente en el Forum de Inglewood, California, y posiblemente ante el ex titular, Ruslan Provodnikov. Esa seria una pelea muy interesante, con el tipo de oponente que podria elevar a Crawford a un nivel superior.

Felix Verdejo G10 William Silva

Peso ligero

Tarjetas: 100-90 (dos veces), 99-91

R[ecords: Verdejo (20-0, 14 KO); Silva (23-1, 14 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: A traves de las primeras 19 peleas de su carrera, Verdejo de 22 anos, un puertorriqueno olimpico en 2012, el prospecto del ano 2014 de ESPN.com y el boxeador que muchos creen que se convertira en la proxima gran estrella de la isla, ha sido practicamente imparable en sus peleas en el ambito profesional, camino a un titulo mundial practicamente ordenado. Desde hace tiempo es vendedor de entradas en Puerto Rico y Nueva York, Verdejo parece ser el paquete completo con capacidad y carisma, que es la razon por la que hay muchas esperanzas de que con el tiempo pase a ser esa rara combinacion de un gran pugil y estrella del PPV.

Tal vez esas expectativas deben ser al menos ligeramente atemperadas despues de la actuacion contra Silva, de 28 anos y de Brasil. Ahora bien, Verdejo, obviamente, gano con facilidad. Los tres jueces le dieron a Verdejo 29 de los 30 puntos entregados. Pero a pesar de que Verdejo avanzo sin dificultades y Silva a menudo conecto algunos golpes de calidad y ganchos de izquierda, no fue una actuacion memorable. Fue la unica cosa que una pelea de Verdejo por lo general no es: Aburrida. Parte de la razon se debe a que Silva, con un record construido en contra de desconocidos completos, entro en la pelea supuestamente para hacer ver sensacional a Verdejo en el gran escenario de HBO, y se vio incomodo. Se movio mucho, algunas veces tambien corrio y no mostro ninguna urgencia en una pelea que se iba cayendo despacio. La cantidad de golpes y su velocidad fueron pateticas. Silva aterrizo 45 de 325 golpes (14 por ciento), segun CompuBox. Mientras que Verdejo conecto 106 de 421 golpes (25 por ciento), nunca parecio tener un buen ritmo, ni montar su ofensiva como usualmente lo hace.

Dicho lo anterior, Verdejo gano y sumo rondas que ayudaran a su desarrollo en el largo plazo. Fue su segunda pelea desde una cirugia en la mano izquierda a mediados de 2015, la cual descarrilo sus planes y lo limito a solo tres peleas el ano pasado en lugar de las cinco o seis que Top Rank habia planeado. La compania espera obtener de el cinco o seis peleas este ano. Ya hizo una y estara de regreso el 16 de abril para encabezar una tarjeta televisada por UNIMAS en Puerto Rico, seguida de un retorno al Theater del Madison Square Garden el 11 de junio, en la vispera del desfile anual puertorriqueno en Nueva York.

Sabado en Anaheim, Calif.

Leo Santa Cruz KOT5 Kiko Martinez

Retiene un t[itulo peso pluma

Records: Santa Cruz (32-0-1, 18 KO); Martinez (35-7, 26 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: El 29 de agosto, Santa Cruz supero al ex campeon en tres divisiones, Abner Mares, en una pelea excelente para pelear por un cinturon vacante de peso pluma. Fue la victoria mas importante de la carrera de Santa Cruz y gano un titulo mundial en su tercera clase de peso despues de tener cinturones previamente en el peso gallo y pluma junior.

Para su primera defensa, Santa Cruz, de 27 anos y nativo de Mexico con base en La Habra, California, enfrento al diminuto Martinez, de 29 anos y de Espana, un ex campeon de peso pluma junior que ha visto pasar sus mejores dias.

Santa Cruz, cuya cartera fue de $1 millon, contra los miseros $150.000 de Martinez, casi termino la pelea en el primer asalto, cuando derribo a Martinez dos veces. Primero lo hizo con una derecha a la cabeza 23 segundos en la pelea y mas tarde con otra derecha. Martinez llego a ganar cada centavo de su cartera y se fue detras de Santa Cruz, haciendolo tambalear brevemente en el tercer asalto. Pero Santa Cruz fue demasiado grande, demasiado potente y demasiado preciso para Martinez.

En el quinto asalto, Santa Cruz lo apoyo contra las cuerdas y comenzo a lanzar disparos con abandono.

Martinez habia sido lastimado por una derecha y siguio recibiendo golpes hasta que el arbitro Raul Caiz Sr. detuvo la pelea a los 2 minutos y 9 segundos. Martinez hizo un gran esfuerzo, y el y Santa Cruz montaron en una pelea entretenida, aunque no fue una pelea muy competitiva. De acuerdo con las estadisticas de CompuBox, Santa Cruz aterrizo 234 de 570 (41 por ciento), mientras que Martinez conecto solo 74 de 468 (16 por ciento).

""A los fanaticos les encanta cuando dos pugiles se enfrentan cara a cara"", dijo Santa Cruz. ""Queria darles a los fans una gran pelea. Yo sabia que podia lastimarlo con una derecha. Es un luchador. Asi que sabia que cuando lo derribara, el iba a volver. En la quinta ronda, sabia que tenia que acabar con el y asi lo hice"".

Santa Cruz dijo que le gustaria hacer frente a un oponente de primer nivel en su siguiente combate. En la parte superior de su lista esta Carl Frampton, quien unifico titulos de peso pluma junior al principio del dia en Inglaterra, y podria subir de peso. Esa es una pelea muy factible, ya que ambos trabajan con el manager/asesor Al Haymon. Si no es esa pelea, a Santa Cruz le gustaria unificar con titulares como Gary Russell Jr. o Lee Selby, que tambien trabajan con Haymon.

Hugo Ruiz KOT1 Julio Cesar Ceja

Gana un titulo peso junior pluma

Records: Ruiz (36-3, 32 KO); Ceja (30-2, 27 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Cuando los compatriotas mexicanos Ruiz y Ceja se enfrentaron el 29 de agosto, nos regalaron una batalla emocionante llena de accion para ocupar el titulo mundial de peso pluma junior que Leo Santa Cruz, que lucho en el evento principal de la noche, habia dejado vacante. Fue una tremenda pelea en la que Ruiz, de 29 anos, hizo caer a Ceja, de 23 anos, en la tercera ronda y quedo adelante en las tres tarjetas entrando en la quinta vuelta, cuando Ceja irrumpio de nuevo para anotar un gran nocaut y ganar el titulo mundial de las 122 libras.

Se enfrentaron en una revancha inmediata en otra tarjeta no principal de Santa Cruz y Ruiz -- que se traslado a una marca 4-0 en revanchas -- aseguro su venganza en forma increiblemente rapida y un poco extravagante. Necesito solo 51 segundos para terminar con Ceja en la forma en que parecia que iba a hacerlo en agosto. Poco despues de comenzar la pelea, Ruiz le clavo a un Ceja desprevenido una derecha en el menton. Mientras Ceja caia al piso, se lastimo seriamente el tobillo. Se las arreglo para levantarse, pero se tuvo que sostener sobre una sola pierna y no hubo forma de mantener alejado a Ruiz. Este ultimo ataco a su enemigo obstaculizado, que estaba terminado, y el arbitro Thomas Taylor intervino para detener la pelea, dandole a Ruiz el nocaut de primera ronda que el mismo predijo antes de la pelea.

Mientras Ruiz se largo a llorar cuando le colocaban el cinturon alrededor de la cintura, Ceja fue llevado al hospital y diagnosticado con una fractura en el tobillo derecho.

A Ceja le gustaria volver a enfrentarlo cuando se recupere de la lesion en el tobillo, pero no suena demasiado posible.

""Ceja esta implorando por una tercera pelea, pero no estamos pensando en eso"", dijo Sampson Lewkowicz, co-promotor de Ruiz. ""A excepcion de un golpe de suerte en la primera pelea, Hugo domino en todos los asaltos.

Estamos mas interesados en uno de los otros campeones de esta division emocionante. Disfruto de una buena relacion de trabajo con el equipo detras del campeon unificado, Carl Frampton. Estariamos dispuestos a viajar a Europa para hacer que suceda esa sensacional pelea"".

Sabado en Manchester, Inglaterra

Carl Frampton G12 Scott Quigg

Unifico dos titulos peso junior pluma

Tarjetas: 116-112 (dos veces) Frampton, 115-113 Quigg

Records: Frampton (22-0, 14 KO); Quigg (31-1-2, 23 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: Incluso antes de que Quigg reclamara su titulo mundial en 2013 y Frampton ganara el suyo en 2014, el publico britanico queria ver esta pelea. Muchos pensaron que seria una genial, tal vez incluso para unirse al panteon de las grandes peleas por el titulo mundial de peso pluma junior ya que sus estilos parecian hechos el uno para el otro y no parecian gustarse mucho mutuamente. Pero cuando Frampton, de 29 anos y de Irlanda del Norte (haciendo su tercera defensa del titulo) y Quigg, de 27 anos y de Inglaterra (haciendo su septima defensa) finalmente se enfrentaron ante el publico local de Quigg, la gran pelea termino siendo un gran fiasco. No pudo estar a la altura de los ultimos grandes combates del mismo nivel como Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao y Wladimir Klitschko-Tyson Fury. Durante los primeros dos tercios, el enfrentamiento fue rotundamente aburrido.

Quigg parecio petrificado y basicamente regalo probablemente las primeras seis o siete rondas, y asi no hay manera de ganar una pelea. Frampton tampoco hizo demasiado, pero pudo ganar rondas porque al menos fue mas agresivo, lanzando mas golpes y aterrizando algunos golpes decentes. El credito va para Joe Gallagher, el entrenador de Quigg, que fue por lo menos honesto con Quigg y le conto la verdad creia que estaba detras de esto: A lo largo de seis asaltos, Quigg habia aterrizado solo 11 golpes totales.

Quigg cobro vida y lucho bien a partir de la octava ronda. Ataco el cuerpo de Frampton y lo sacudio un par de veces, pero Frampton gano claramente el asalto 12 para quedarse con la pelea, a pesar de la tarjeta por 115-113 del juez Levi Martinez a favor de Quigg, que convirtio el resultado en una decision dividida, que fue muy generosa.

Que tan mala fue la pelea? De acuerdo con las estadisticas de CompuBox, Frampton aterrizo solamente 83 de 592 golpes (14 por ciento). Quigg fue practicamente patetico cuando aterrizo solamente 85 de 322 golpes (26 por ciento), pero al parecer habia sufrido una lesion en la mandibula. Quigg ni siquiera pudo aterrizar su primer golpe fuerte hasta el ultimo minuto de la cuarta ronda.

""No podia creer que fuera una decision dividida"", dijo Frampton. ""No se lo que ese muchacho estaba viendo, pero siempre y cuando termine con mi mano levantada al final de la pelea, eso es lo principal. Tenemos una gran rivalidad, y fue una gran pelea al final. El arranque no fue muy bueno, pero, por supuesto, lo haria de nuevo. Estoy feliz de pelear en el peso pluma junior, pero si surge una gran pelea en el peso pluma -- (Leo) Santa Cruz, (Lee) Selby -- estoy listo para cualquiera de ellos"".

Quigg no apelo la decision y admitio que deberia haber presionado el ritmo mas temprano en la pelea.

""Me senti comodo"", dijo Quigg. ""Los jueces deben haber estado contando sus golpes como puntuacion, pero pense que los estaba bloqueando. Deberia haber empezado mas rapido. Me senti comodo y pense que estaba ganando las rondas porque no estaba ganando claramente. No voy a quejarme. Quiero una revancha. Quiza la proxima vez empiece con mas fuerza"".

S[abado en Halle, Alemania

Marco Huck KOT10 Ola Afolabi

Peso crucero

Records: Huck (39-3-1, 27 KO); Afolabi (22-5-4, 11 KO)

Comentario de Rafael: En agosto, Huck, de 31 anos y de Alemania, llego a los Estados Unidos para luchar por primera vez con la esperanza de establecer el record de la division de peso crucero de 14 defensas del titulo al vencer al polaco Krzysztof Glowacki, su retador obligado. Fue una tremenda pelea y uno de los dos mejores combates del ano, pero Glowacki anoto un gran triunfo noqueandolo de forma espectacular en una remontada en el decimoprimer round.

Huck estaba peleando por la primera vez y lo hizo en contra de su mas feroz rival en Afolabi, de 35 anos y de Inglaterra. Se habian reunido en tres ocasiones anteriores. En la primera pelea, Huck gano una decision unanime en 2009. Ellos se enfrentaron a un empate mayoritario en una revancha en 2012. En el enfrentamiento numero tres, Huck gano por decision mayoritaria en otra dura y ajustada pelea en 2013.

Se reunieron por cuarta vez y esta vez Huck no solo se recupero bien de la derrota ante Glowacki, sino que se traslado a 3-0-1 contra Huck y tambien lo hizo de la manera mas convincente, ya que era la primera vez que Afolabi era noqueado.

Huck, como de costumbre, fue muy agresivo y fue al ataque, tanto que el ojo izquierdo de Afolabi estaba hinchado por la mitad de la pelea. el arbitro Jack Reiss le quito un punto a Huck por lanzar un golpe despues de la campana en la novena vuelta, pero hacia el final del decimo, el ojo de Afolabi estaba totalmente hinchado y cerrado, de modo que Reiss detuvo la pelea en la esquina despues del asalto.

Ahora, a Huck le gustaria una revancha con Glowacki. Seria una pelea atractiva, pero Glowacki antes tiene programado hacer su primera defensa ante el ex dos veces campeon, Steve Cunningham (que le entrego a Huck su primera derrota en 2007) el 16 de abril por NBC en horario de maxima audiencia en el Barclays Center de Brooklyn, Nueva York.",[]
espn.com,,Mikaela Shiffrin wins World Cup slalom by huge margin as Frida Hansdotter takes season title,"['Johnette Howard', 'Espn Staff', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Adriana Terrazas', 'Bonnie D']","JASNA, Slovakia -- Unbeaten in her favorite discipline for more than a year, Mikaela Shiffrin still had to congratulate Frida Hansdotter of Sweden on winning the World Cup slalom title Sunday.

The Olympic champion from the United States won the next-to-last race by a massive 2.36-second margin while Hansdotter finished 4.13 seconds back in 10th to wrap up the title.

Shiffrin has won all seven slaloms she competed in since February 2015 but couldn't retain the discipline title this season after missing five races during a two-month injury layoff.

""I knew this was going to happen when I got injured,"" said Shiffrin, who damaged her knee warming up for a giant slalom in Are, Sweden, in December. ""First I was really mad. After a while, I honestly believe that she deserves it. For Frida's performances in the past four years, she deserves to have something like a crystal globe to have at home and to look at the rest of her life and say, 'Yeah, I won that fair and square.'""

Hansdotter holds a 105-point lead over Veronika Velez-Zuzulova with only the season-ending race in St. Moritz, Switzerland, remaining. It's the Swede's first discipline title after Shiffrin won it the past three seasons.

In front of 17,000 spectators and defying tough conditions due to snowfall and rain, Shiffrin posted the fastest time in both runs to finish ahead of Wendy Holdener of Switzerland. Velez-Zuzulova of Slovakia was 2.77 back in third.

""It feels like a dream, a little bit, and I am scared that I am going to wake up,"" Shiffrin said about another huge winning margin, three months after setting a record by winning a slalom by 3.07 seconds. ""Both runs I tried to pretend there was a bear hunting me so I had to be fast. It worked really well.""

Shiffrin, who turns 21 next week, earned her 19th World Cup victory. Only Austrian great Annemarie Moser-Proell had won more races -- 31 -- at the same age.

Shiffrin had left her rivals in awe after a stunning first run that gave her a 1.67-second lead. Putting in a trademark performance, she accelerated to an unmatched pace after a moderate start.

""It was really good. I felt good,"" said Shiffrin, who was congratulated by many competitors and received a complimentary pat on the shoulder from Norway's Nina Loeseth while standing in front of the leaderboard.

The American was conservative in the first few gates, and Velez-Zuzulova even led her by 0.13 at the first split time.

""Every run is like a 50-50 chance that I have my timing or I don't,"" Shiffrin said. ""The two months off, I definitely lost a little bit of the confidence in my timing, but that run I definitely had it.""

Extending her big lead with a solid final run, Shiffrin's victory never was in doubt.

""Mikaela is really good at the moment,"" Holdener said. ""She skis better than us. We have to push hard so we can get to her level.""

It was the first race at the Slovakian resort in the Low Tatras mountains since 1984.

Skiing in front of her loudly cheering home crowd, Velez-Zululova was ""very happy"" to finish third.

""To have a home race was a dream, and it's even better now I am on the podium,"" Velez-Zuzulova said. ""It was no easy race because of all the pressure and the expectations.""

espn.com,,UFC 196 -- Miesha Tate takes bantamweight title from Holly Holm with fifth-round submission,['Brett Okamoto'],"LAS VEGAS -- Less than four months after her stunning win over Ronda Rousey, Holly Holm's time as a UFC champion is over.

Miesha Tate (18-5), who late last year admitted she was considering retirement, submitted Holm with a rear-naked choke at 3:30 of the final round of their 135-pound title fight Saturday night in the co-main event of UFC 196 inside MGM Grand Garden Arena.

Editor's Picks Lawler-GSP among potential matchups for UFC 200 The losses by Conor McGregor and Holly Holm were blows to the UFC's milestone event on July 9, but Brett Okamoto proposes a lineup of fights that could still make it epic.

Diaz upsets McGregor by 2nd-round submission In a stunner, Nate Diaz made Conor McGregor eat his words, submitting him by rear-naked choke in Round 2 of their welterweight bout Saturday night in the UFC 196 co-main event.

Presumably down on the scorecards entering the fifth round, Tate latched herself onto Holm's back during a scramble in the center of the cage. Holm stood, wearing Tate as a backpack. Tate sneaked her right arm under Holm's chin, and in a final desperate attempt to break free, Holm front flipped to the ground.

Holm (10-1) refused to tap. She went unconscious, still throwing punches into the air in front of her.

""I let my guard down, and it cost me the fight,"" Holm said in her postmatch news conference.

UFC president Dana White joined SportsCenter on Saturday night to declare that Tate's first bantamweight defense will come against Rousey, who has not set a return date.

""I think that Ronda now will fight Miesha Tate for the title. That's what's going to happen,"" White said. ""That's what I said before this fight even happened. Whoever wins tonight will fight Ronda for the title.""

White said he contacted Rousey, who was not watching Saturday's fight.

""I text Ronda, and she said, 'What happened?'"" White said. ""I said, 'Miesha just choked her unconscious.' She said, 'Looks like I gotta get back to work.'""

Rousey's two previous wins against Tate each came via armbar. Holm said she wanted a rematch against Tate but would take any opportunity UFC provided.

White said Rousey doesn't plan to fight until the fall, but he will inquire of her interest to fight Tate earlier than that.

""I feel we had a great game plan,"" said Tate, a former Strikeforce titleholder. ""She's very dangerous. She's capable of catching anyone at any moment. She's a calculated fighter. I thought I had to be like a pit bull with a bone [with the choke]. I knew she wasn't getting out of that one.""

Until that final sequence, it looked as if it would be a what-if kind of night for Tate. She took Holm down in the second round and eventually took her back with 90 seconds to work. Twice she threatened to finish with a rear-naked choke only to have Holm barely fight her off.

Things largely went according to plan for Holm, who fights out of Jackson Wink MMA in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She maintained distance against Tate well and stuffed the majority of her takedowns. Holm caught her with a couple left hooks and racked up points on the scorecards with jabs and side kicks. She reddened Tate's face with punches in the first round.

Holm was motivated to train and reinsert herself into the title mix as soon as possible, even declaring her desire to fight Tate again as soon as she can.

""I want to fight Miesha tomorrow,"" Holm said. ""... I'm more anxious to get in and train right now than I have been in a long time.""

She rebuffed criticism of her decision to defend her title before she had the chance to face Rousey in a rematch.

""I'm in it to fight. That's what I'm in it for,"" Holm said. ""And tonight, I made some mistakes. ... I need to fix those mistakes. I'm going to come back stronger.""

According to immediate stats by Fightmetric, Holm outstruck Tate 68 to 65, although that was mostly due to a 29-1 Tate advantage in the second round.

Tate, 29, has now won five fights in a row. She said late last year she wasn't sure if she would continue her career, after UFC skipped over a promised title shot to book a fight between Holm and Rousey.

The New York Giants are signing Janoris Jenkins (deals don't become official until 4 ET Wednesday) to try to patch up their ailing secondary, but they are committing big money to a player who still gets beaten for big plays with staggering regularity and is at best a boom-or-bust type of player.

Jenkins has surrendered 22 career touchdowns over his four seasons, more than all but two other corners over the same span. To put that into context, Richard Sherman has allowed just 10, across five seasons including the playoffs, and the playoffs in his case add another 10 games to the sample size.

""I'm progressing slowly, I take it day by day,"" Woods said in Montgomery, Texas, where he opened a 10-hole short course at his BlueJack National design. ""That's the frustrating part. There is no timetable.""

Woods said he is chipping and putting and has hit nothing longer than a 9-iron. He has yet to play a full hole of golf since underdoing his latest back procedure on Oct. 28.

He acknowledged that he has returned too soon from previous injuries and that ""it's cost me months and years because of it.

Tiger Woods, shown teeing off during the Wyndham Championship in August, posted an update on his website Wednesday on his progress. Jared C. Tilton/Getty Images

""The big thing right now is trying to get stronger and more flexible,'' Woods wrote on his website earlier Wednesday, prior to the news conference. ""Sitting out as long as I did, some weakening occurred, and I have a lot of work ahead of me.

""While there is no timetable on my return to competitive golf, I want to play this game at the highest level again. In order to do that, I have to get healthy.''

Woods has not played competitively in more than six months. The 14-time major champion's rehabilitation has been kept mostly quiet until the past week, when a couple of reports suggested his recovery was going poorly.

But Woods' agent, Mark Steinberg, strongly denied those reports on Feb. 22 and then two days later the golfer posted a 13-second video on Twitter in which he was shown hitting a 9-iron on a golf simulator. Steinberg said that Woods had worked up to hitting that club, along with chipping and putting, at that point.

""As I announced last week, I am starting to feel a lot better,'' Woods wrote. ""I have been chipping and putting at home and recently started hitting 9-irons.''

Editor's Picks Day calls Tiger for advice on 'killer instinct' PGA champion Jason Day called Tiger Woods for advice on getting back his ""killer instinct.""

Woods has a couple of shorts holes at his home in Jupiter, Florida. He said he has been having 3-hole chipping contests with his son, Charlie, with the loser having to do push-ups.

The last time Woods played in a tournament, he tied for 10th in the Wyndham Championship in August. In mid-September, however, he had his second back surgery -- he had his first on March 31, 2014 -- and then had another undisclosed type of back surgery on Oct. 28.

When Woods appeared at the tournament he hosts, the Hero World Challenge in December, he appeared in discomfort and spoke of seeing ""no light at the end of the tunnel'' as far as his return. At that point, he had not been cleared to do any rehabilitation.

""I couldn't play with my kids,"" he said during the news conference. ""I wasn't able to throw and play catch with my son. These were the things I couldn't do. Can I do them now? Yeah. Am I sprinting back and forth with them? No. I can't keep up with them. They're out running and doing things I can't do. But I'm getting there. I'm able to participate more in their lives. Part of that is playing golf, and going out there chipping and putting with Charlie. Having him beat me. It's been tough at times, but it's been a lot of fun.""

With the Masters now just five weeks away, playing the year's first major would seem to be a long shot. A four-time winner of the tournament, Woods missed it two years ago following his first back surgery but tied for 17th last year.

""Just need to take it day by day,"" he said. ""I just need to keep the momentum going. Hopefully I can continue doing that and then eventually get out here. Hopefully sooner than later.""

Whether that is weeks or months he could not say, either.

""I don't know,"" he said. ""In December I wasn't able to participate with my kids and do things I like to do with them. Am I doing that right now, a lot more but still not all the way there yet. And eventually it's getting to an elite level and playing out here with the guys. That's going to take some work.

""I haven't hit anything more than a 9-iron. ... Just been chipping and putting and progressing slowly. I still have to get stronger. I still have to get more flexible. There's still a lot I have to do.""",[]

espn.com,,"Profiling Swift, Doinb, all of team Qiao Gu Reaper","['Tyler Fionn', 'James Bates']","It was an electric atmosphere last August at the 2015 Tencent LoL Pro League finals in China, the country's biggest tournament. Cheers from a raucous crowd competed with dubstep blaring out of loudspeakers for control of the airwaves. Spotlights flashed throughout the stadium, illuminating stands packed with fans before coming to rest in the middle of the stage, lighting up the Chinese version of the Summoner's Cup and reminding the 10 young men surrounding it what they came to fight for.

To hold that cup aloft is the ultimate honor in the Tencent LoL Pro League. It represents dominance over the region and, more importantly, would mark the owners as the top team from the Chinese region heading into the World Championships in October. Winning the Pro League finals was the first step to being the first team to bring the championship pennant to China.

Editor's Picks League of Legends global power rankings through Week 6 SK Telecom drops like a rock, Echo Fox continues to climb, and the Tigers drop a spot. Just kidding, they're still #1.

When the announcer introduced the favorites, LGD Gaming, the crowd erupted. It's an organization as old as the LPL itself, with fans as rabid as they are plentiful. To many in the stadium, LGD represented the best hope for China to win it all, as previous favorites EDG had been mired with issues since earning a stunning upset victory in the Invitational.

But when LGD's opponents were introduced, the crowd barely buzzed. Heading into the Pro League finals, the newly formed Qiao Gu Reapers were nothing but upstarts, having narrowly defeated longtime fan favorites Invictus Gaming to earn its place in the finals. Yet most wished it hadn't. Newly promoted from the LSPL, China's amateur league, the QG Reapers were seen as a middle-of-the-pack team in an LPL that was well known for its extremely loyal fans, most of whom felt cheated when the new kids on the block scored upset victories against their favorite established teams. Many would consider it a shame if QG Reapers defeated LGD, yet there it stood, each of the team's members grinning in turn as they were introduced. Everyone expected LGD to dismantle the Reapers.

Yet when the dust settled, LGD took the throne after a riveting five-game series, a far cry from the expected one-sided affair. Qiao Gu would fade from everyone's minds as it succumbed to Invictus Gaming, who won the right to represent China alongside EDG. The three Chinese teams would go on to have an infamously bad performance at the World Championships. The best of them, EDG, would lose in the first elimination round after hardly putting up a fight against a Fnatic lineup that seemed destined to prove the West wasn't as weak as everyone believed (a lineup it had embarrassed easily on its way to winning the very Midseason Invitational that set the expectations for China so high). Through it all, the QG Reapers watched. They waited. They planned. They practiced.

Flash forward to the beginning of the 2016 season, and the QG Reapers have done something that few in the industry would have predicted: they have dominated the competition. Through Feb. 26, the Reapers remain undefeated on the season, having dropped just a single game -- to Vici Gaming, a game that looked more like a dominant team playing with its food and getting burned more so than it did any kind of upset. While the Reapers have yet to claim the throne, few question that they deserve it, as every contender has either been struck down outright or become embroiled in internal issues, paving the way for the Reapers to make history.

But who are these new kings of China? What sort of players make a team go from a nameless amateur squad to a unit whose dominance is the predominant storyline in the region? Here's a look at each QG Reaper, including their backstory, strengths and weaknesses.

V: The great role player

There are two types of players that make up a winning roster: the superstar players who generate hype and carry their team with all of the resources they're handed, and the role players who enable them. In most sports, too often the latter is overlooked. If you want to succeed in a game that requires such careful resource allocation like LoL, someone is going to have to put their ego aside and take one for the team. For the QG Reapers, that someone is V, their top laner. While other top laners might rely on the support of their jungler to get them through the laning phase, V instead does the exact opposite. When Swift and Doinb are looking to make an aggressive play, he acts to support it. Other times, V will sit back in the lane, patiently awaiting an opportunity to join his team in the skirmishes they're so renowned for.

This may be painting a picture of a mechanically weak top laner, relegated to a supporting role due to lack of skill. That couldn't be further from the truth with V, and it's why he's such an exceptional player. He has the potential to be a star but forsakes it for the good of his team. Some teams rely on a top laner that can consistently duel and eke out advantages in the often harsh microcosm of top lane, such as Vitality's Cabochard. Qiao Gu, however, are a team that typically win as a team, not as individuals, and as such ask for a much different type of top laner, one who can buy the carries the time they need in teamfights and do it without resources. Not many top laners can survive while being left to fend entirely for themselves, watching as their carries swoop in to take any easy farm that might otherwise be theirs. V is one of those top laners -- and one of the most valuable role players in all of China.

Swift: The quintessential carry jungler

While it would be disingenuous to say that Swift came out of nowhere, it's hard to argue that on QG Reapers he has found a form that few could have dreamed would be possible, considering his somewhat underwhelming rookie season with CJ Entus. On QG, all of his old weaknesses have become strengths, as he was suddenly surrounded by something that he hadn't had before: a roster willing both to support and trust him. In particular, his partnership with fellow Korean Doinb is beautiful to watch on the Rift, as Doinb has even gone so far as to adopt a style that many might call inefficient just to give Swift the opening he wants in the early game. Swift, for his part, wastes no time in exploiting those openings, invading the enemy jungle with ruthless efficiency. It's this style that makes Swift so unique, as traditionally junglers are beholden to their laners, ganking and warding for them as they demand. On QG, however, the relationship is much more two-sided. Yes, Swift will gank for you, and yes, he'll clear that pink and keep tabs on the enemy jungler, but in return he asks that his lanes be ready to support him when he picks a fight. The fact his teammates do so without hesitation is what has led to Swift's incredible stats, nearly leading the league in CSPM while also leading in KDA and ward statistics.

Swift's true power, however, is teamfighting. It's not without reason that most refer to him as China's premiere carry jungler, and his damage statistics are unique in that he has found himself even outperforming his teammates with traditional carry roles. His Graves performance in particular bears mentioning, as he holds a nearly unbelievable 11.4 KDA over five games, averaging but a single death in each. As a reference point, the only notable player with a higher KDA on a single champion is another QG player: Peco, who currently holds an astonishing 18.17 average KDA on Ezreal over seven games. All of this points to one conclusion: Swift is a legitimate carry threat on this team and is reminiscent of the days of yore, when in Season 3 a player like InSec could single-handedly carry his team from the jungle.

Doinb: The 'Genius Mid Laner'

Unlike his fellow Korean, Swift, Doinb had no pedigree to fall back on. When the QG Reapers found him, he was simply a high-level solo queue player, the kind who teams occasionally gamble on in the hopes of training the next breakout player. To say the QG Reapers struck gold is putting it mildly, as Doinb immediately took off and has put his mark on the LPL, earning plenty of MVPs in his inaugural split. In the Summer Split, he distinguished himself as one of the world's unofficial masters of Viktor, being one of four players who spent most of the split undefeated on the champion. In addition, his LeBlanc was feared enough to draw bans from most any team, bans that often left his even more dominant Viktor up for the taking. That in itself demonstrates his versatility, as he is as comfortable playing teamfights with entirely divergent styles.

Versatility, though, is not Doinb's only asset, nor his greatest. Like many of his teammates, he's willing to adapt to what the team as a whole requires, using his natural ingenuity to adapt to circumstances on the fly. As such, the LPL casters have dubbed him the ""Genius Mid Laner."" Between games, you can see his style shift, his level of aggression changing based on gamestate. Often he'll simply stand in mid lane, content to slaughter the minions before abruptly changing priorities, dumping all of his mana into making the enemy laner fight him. These exchanges often aren't productive for him, but that's not the point: At the same time, across the map, Swift will be killing a ward, taking a camp or even diving a tower. The aggression isn't sending a message of dominance, but rather acts as a delaying tactic. One needs to look no further than Swift's stats to see the effectiveness of this tactic, and amazingly, Doinb rarely is punished beyond a minor loss in lane pressure for such tactics. That highlight what is, in my opinion, truly his greatest strength. For Doinb, no game is ever lost and no matchup is too hard to overcome. This is the man who blind first picks Viktor, something lesser mid laners would consider suicide. Doinb does it with a smile, joking all the way through champion select, daring the enemy team to counter him. So far, such a smile would be justified, as he has yet to lose a series this year.

Peco: Quietly dominant

Much like Swift, Peco was a player who was a fairly known quantity before joining the QG Reapers, and while his results belied his skill he still had little glory to his name. He had been a constant figure in the LPL and LSPL but always seemed close to breaking out without ever doing so, with his greatest accomplishment having been a fourth-place finish with Royal Club in Summer 2013. Even as far back as last year, he might have been called something of an underperformer, as most of QG's notorious early game issues stemmed from the duo lane.

The winter break, however, has changed all that. Peco shed his old name and old ways, no longer going by TnT in game; and if you didn't know that he was the same player from last year, it would be tempting to think he was someone else entirely. Not only does he lead the LPL in KDA, but he also leads by a margin that is nearly impossible to believe, averaging a 16.39 KDA over the 12 games he has played thus far.

The amazing thing is that few seem to realize how big of a threat Peco is. Despite having demonstrated a willingness to pick Ezreal literally every time it's open, no opposing team has yet contested the pick. Meanwhile, both Doinb and Swift draw targeted bans in every series they participate. Part of the reason for this is obvious: Peco seems almost like a background player, quietly waiting until the proper moment to strike in a fashion that is hard to compare to any other player in his role. A similar western player might be Rekkles, who's noted -- and criticized -- for a style that is passive until he feels comfortable fighting. In Peco, though, we see an evolution of that style and it comes from the defining attributes of QG: trust and coordination. A typical QG game can almost be said to have a script: Doinb, Swift and Mor cause chaos and confusion around the map, drawing the attention of both casters and the enemy team, while Peco simply sits in one of the lanes farming. Only when he shows up to one of QG's teamfights with three completed items does the enemy team realize their mistake. Even in games that were all but lost, Peco's presence makes a difference, as he has proven time and again to be impossible to shut down. (He's always crawling into relevance despite how poorly his lane phase might go.)

Regardless of how QG goes about winning the game, though, Peco is sure to be a vital part of it, managing to quietly support his team from the role most associated with being neither quiet nor supportive.

Mor: Learning every step of the way

When QG was founded, there was a very obvious weakness: Mor. Known best as LMQ Mor, he's fairly renowned for one thing in particular: meeting a swift end directly after checking a bush with his face. Unfortunately, the jury is still out on whether he has been fully reformed. He still has the most deaths on his team by a fairly wide margin, but -- and I say this in a non-ironic way -- he's learning to make those deaths count more. Gone are the days when NA casters would roll their eyes at yet another pointless Mor death; now he goes down swinging with his team, at least most of the time.

Regardless, his synergy with V and Swift when it comes to forming a defensive core is unparalleled, with their ability to properly layer CC being nearly mythical. It's this core that has led to QG being known as such a force in teamfights, as Doinb and Peco are gifted a ton of time to safely pick out enemy targets simply due to the rest of the team doing such a good job at controlling those targets. Overall, there's not a lot more that can be said for Mor, except that he's easily the most improved player on a roster that is full of players on the rise. He's truly learning to be better every step of the way, and that's no small feat for a player who has been a part of the league for the entirety of its existence.

Team outlook

While they might all be talented, QG has never been a team that was good because its players were good. Rather, their victories came from a level of coordination and teamfighting prowess that has never really been seen in the game's history. While teams that specialize in the large 5-vs-5s are not uncommon, few can claim to have won such fights while sitting in a 10,000 gold deficit. QG, on the other hand, has done that so often that it's practically their moniker. Each of their games in 2015 had the same story: fall significantly behind early in the game and either win fights against all odds or not. That first bit is relevant, as it's historically been the issue that QG has struggled with since their inception in the LPL. Their early game has always been weak, and critics would be right to point out that their amazing teamfighting is borne from necessity; without that aspect, they would have struggled to win a single game in 2015 and certainly wouldn't have been the runner-ups in the Summer Split playoffs.

This year, however, has seen the rise of a different team, a more focused unit. Last year saw QG emerge with clear strengths and weaknesses but no clear idea of how to utilize either. When they fell, it was to teams who could exploit them. They were a team with potential, though one that needed time to bring it to bear. QG was not idle in the offseason, however. They learned and they planned, and their work has borne fruit, as now they clearly know their strengths and know how to avoid their weaknesses. Their weak duo lane is now eternally hidden in lane swaps, or, when the swap is called, they play with such passivity that they are impossible to exploit. Swift's extreme aggression is matched by both Doinb and Mor's pressure, so rather than having any of those three players randomly walking into their deaths -- a common source of their issues in 2015 -- you now see the three act in concert, easily winning fights that surely would have been losses last year.

The mitigation of their weaknesses has done nothing to hide their strengths, either. They still have some of the best teamfighting coordination ever seen on the Rift. They still have solid strategic play -- a style that is unique to them in that they prioritize finding and engaging the enemy, unsurprising when you consider their strengths tend to be fighting enemy champions. Plus, they still have a playmaker in every single role. The question no longer is whether QG will get its act together; rather, with another Midseason Invitational looming, the question is how far can the new kings of China can go?",[]

The deal was first reported by ESPN's Adam Schefter and Adam Caplan.

The move can't be made official until 4 p.m. ET Wednesday when the new league year begins.

Daniel, 29, will rejoin Pederson, who is now the head coach of the Eagles. Mark Sanchez, the Eagles' backup for the past two years, is likely the odd man out. Releasing Sanchez would save the Eagles $3.5 million in 2016 salary cap space.

Chase Daniel's role will be to help teach Doug Pederson's system to the Eagles, who signed the former Chiefs quarterback to a three-year deal Wednesday. Jeff Curry/USA TODAY Sports

The Eagles signed quarterback Sam Bradford to a new two-year contract last week. Bradford is likely to be the Eagles' starting quarterback with Daniel serving as the backup.

Daniel and Bradford have brushed shoulders before. Daniel played at the University of Missouri while Bradford was at Oklahoma, when both schools were in the Big 12 Conference. Missouri's only two losses in 2007, including one in the Big 12 championship game, were to Bradford's Oklahoma team.

In 2007, Daniel was invited to New York as one of the finalists for the Heisman Trophy. Florida's Tim Tebow won the Heisman that year. A year later, Bradford won it.

Daniel entered the NFL as an undrafted rookie in 2009. He ended up with the New Orleans Saints in 2010 as a backup to Drew Brees. Daniel spent three years with the Saints before joining the Chiefs in 2013.

That year, Pederson became the Chiefs' offensive coordinator under head coach Andy Reid.

Pederson has emulated his mentor, Reid, with this move. When Reid left Green Bay to become head coach of the Eagles in 1999, he brought Pederson along on a three-year contract. Pederson's role was to start and run the offense correctly while first-round pick Donovan McNabb learned the system.

Pederson was released after the 1999 season.

Daniel will help Pederson teach his system to the Eagles. But Bradford is likely to remain the starter under his two-year, $36 million contract. Pederson, who backed up McNabb, Brett Favre and Dan Marino during his career, values the impact a smart backup can have.

Daniel's role will be that much more important if the Eagles draft a quarterback this year. Pederson has said that would be his ideal plan, bringing in a young quarterback to develop. With Bradford learning the offense and starting, Daniel would have time to help a rookie make the transition from college to the NFL.",[]

If you were told you were going to interview a teenager who has millions of dollars in the bank, an agent, a life of international travel attended by two coaches, a trainer, a physio and someone to carry their bag at work -- what would you be expecting?

Not Lydia Ko, that's for sure. The 18-year-old New Zealander who never missed a cut as an amateur in a professional tournament is now the world's top female golfer with the demeanour of everyone's favourite young professional.

Thousands of column inches have been dedicated to her feats, but in a world dominated by headlines about the petulant tantrums and unsavoury behaviour of sports stars, Ko is a sponsor's dream.

I first interviewed Lydia Ko at the Australian Open in 2011, partway through a tournament in which she said she ""hoped to make the cut."" She went on to be the low amateur at age 13. She was quiet, polite and unassuming, and nothing about her hinted that she was on the path to superstardom ... apart from an exceptional golf game.

Fast forward to 2016, when Ko returned to the Australian Open as defending champion and world No. 1, greeted our team like old friends and happily plonked herself down in the studio chatting about the challenges of learning to drive her first car.

The car in question is no second-hand jalopy but a 2016 Lexus RC F Sports Coupe courtesy of her new sponsor -- not that you would make that assumption looking at the happy relaxed teenager completely comfortable in her own skin.

The learner's driving permit is one sign she is no longer the ""baby"" of the golf tour, but the biggest discernable difference in Ko is the maturity with which she has handled the meteoric rise to golfing greatness.

""My rookie year, I said, man, I don't know if it could get any better than that,"" she said. ""And then it happened last year. So I think there's going to be expectations, but I just focus on one week at a time, so that at the end of the year I still feel happy that I tried my best every week. And that's all I can do, just try my best and have fun.""

Sam Greenwood/Getty Images

She makes it look like fun too, laughing and chatting her way down the fairways, always encouraging her rivals; it's difficult to imagine the endless hours of hard work and the sacrifices behind her achievements.

The hard work is set to continue this year, as Ko has a whole new focus.

After the first 10 games of the season, the Anaheim Ducks appeared to be dead in the water. They were outscored 29-10 and outshot 251-219 during that brutal 1-7-2 stretch. Not only did it appear they would be the NHL's biggest disappointment, but it seemed like a foregone conclusion that they would fire coach Bruce Boudreau and start a full-blown rebuild.

The Cowboys acquired Cassel in a trade from the Buffalo Bills after Tony Romo suffered a broken left collarbone in a Week 2 win against the Philadelphia Eagles. Cassel was inactive for his first two games and served as Brandon Weeden's backup before taking over as the starter Oct. 25 against the New York Giants.

The Cowboys won only one of Cassel's seven starts. In four starts he failed to throw for more than 200 yards and was yanked in favor of Kellen Moore on Dec. 19 against the New York Jets. Moore started the final two games of the season with Cassel as the backup.

(1:41)

SAN DIEGO -- The Chargers are securing playmakers for quarterback Philip Rivers.

The Chargers kept Antonio Gates in the fold, agreeing to terms with the tight end on a two-year contract. The team also signed Cleveland Browns wide receiver Travis Benjamin to a four-year deal worth $24 million and $13 million in guarantees, according to ESPN and media reports.

Gates tweeted about staying in San Diego after his deal was announced.

Happy to remain a @Chargers . My intentions have always been to retire in San Diego . No place I'd rather be. Best Fans and organization.  Antonio Gates (@AntonioGates85) March 9, 2016

While Gates is returning, the Chargers are set to lose another tight end. Ladarius Green is expected to agree to a deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers, a source told Schefter.

Editor's Picks Travis Benjamin gives Philip Rivers another playmaker Receiver Travis Benjamin should take some of the pressure off of Philip Rivers, who ran out of playmakers last season.

McManamon: Browns already feeling free-agent pain The Cleveland Browns already are feeling free-agent pain as a three-win team with plenty of needs created more needs by not keeping their own, Pat McManamon writes.

Chargers general manager Tom Telesco indicated before the start of free agency that the team wanted Gates, who will be 36 in June, to retire a Charger.

Benjamin fills a void in San Diego's offense for a deep threat created by the retirement of Malcom Floyd. The Miami product also serves as a potential playmaker in the Chargers' return game. San Diego averaged a league-low 4.2 yards per punt return in 2015.

""He's a playmaker that brings a different dynamic to our team. His speed will be an asset, as he has shown the ability to really stretch the field,"" coach Mike McCoy said in a statement. ""We're also excited for what he can do as a returner. His speed and overall athleticism will help us in both phases.""

Benjamin, 26, picked the right time to have his best season. He totaled a career-high 68 receptions and 966 yards in 2015, which ranked second on the Browns. Benjamin also had five receiving touchdowns.

""He's just so explosive,"" Rivers said in a statement. ""We saw it when we played [Cleveland] last year. He makes defenses look out because he can run by you in a hurry. He is very versatile and I think he will fit right in as another guy to spread the ball around to.""

Before 2015, Benjamin was mostly used as a situational receiver. He earned a starting job in training camp prior to last season and never gave it up, starting 15 games and setting aside the concern that he was too frail at 175 pounds to play every down.

His speed is his forte, as he also excels as a punt returner. His average of 12.6 yards per return ranks first in the NFL since he entered the league in 2012. He is one of seven players with three punt returns for a touchdown in that time, and he holds the Browns' record for punt-return yardage in a game (179 in 2013) and longest punt return (93 yards in 2012).

Benjamin tore an ACL in 2013 and took almost the entire 2014 season to regain confidence in the knee.

Gates missed four games at the start of last season because of a suspension, and another contest due to an MCL knee sprain. He played through pain during the second half of the year and still produced, finishing with 56 catches for 630 yards and five touchdowns.

With 104 career touchdown receptions, Gates is seven away from tying Tony Gonzalez, the NFL's career leader in touchdown receptions for tight ends. Rivers and Gates have connected on 77 touchdowns during their careers in San Diego, the most in NFL history for a quarterback-tight end tandem.

Gates is the all-time leader for the Chargers in receptions (844), receiving yards (10,644) and touchdown catches.

He has played a full 16-game season in two of the past three years and since 2012 has missed just two games due to injury. He played 463 offensive snaps in 2015.

espn.com,,Novak Djokovic and the streak that finally ended,"['Peter Bodo', 'Pa Sport']","When you're as good as Novak Djokovic, it must become difficult to keep track of the growing body of statistics. One of his more impressive feats came to an end Thursday in Dubai, where the world No. 1 fell to Feliciano Lopez without ever facing match point.

Thus, Djokovic's streak of 17 consecutive ATP Tour finals, one short of matching Ivan Lendl's Open era record, ended because an allergy and eye infection forced him to withdraw after he lost the first set.

Notably, Djokovic said nothing about his streak ending. When one potential record gets taken off the table, another is sure to replace it before you can say ""hyperbaric chamber.""

""I'm really sad to end the tournament this way,"" Djokovic told the press afterward. ""It's the first time I've had such a problem.""

For the first time since the Qatar Open -- in 2015 -- Novak Djokovic failed to reach the final of a tournament. Warren Little/Getty Images

The finals streak is gone, but this week Djokovic also became just the 12th man to record at least 700 ATP Tour match wins in the Open era -- which is not a bad consolation prize.

Djokovic needs just one more Masters 1000 title to match Rafael Nadal, the all-time leader with 27. He needs one more Australian Open title to become the first man to win the singles Down Under seven times. One more ATP World Tour Finals title to become the event's first six-time winner. A French Open title in June to complete a career Grand Slam as well as a ""Novak Slam."" (If he wins at Roland Garros, he'll hold all four major singles titles.)

That's all in the future, though. For now, let's just look at some of his accomplishments over the course of his streak that just ended:

Djokovic was 13-4 in those finals, his most painful loss undoubtedly the four-set French Open failure against Stan Wawrinka last year.

Only one of Djokovic's losses during his run was at an ATP 500 or 250. Roger Federer surprised him in last season's Dubai Championships 6-3, 7-5.

While that upset helped establish Federer as Djokovic's most dangerous rival for the last year, Federer's proficiency would not prove adequate in best-of-five Grand Slam meetings. Djokovic would go on to master Federer at Wimbledon and the US Open, and he handled the Swiss with ease in the World Tour Finals as well.

Djokovic lost only 13 sets in those 17 finals, and he was obliged to play only eight tiebreakers, in which he went 4-4. Five of the finals in the streak were at Grand Slam events. Djokovic won every one but for the French Open loss to Wawrinka. Djokovic was 14-6 in sets over the course of those five finals. He hasn't been forced to five sets in a final since Wimbledon of 2014, where he defeated Federer in a classic.

Only three players outside the Big Four (Djokovic, Federer, Andy Murray and Nadal) made it to a final opposite Djokovic during the streak (Wawrinka, Tomas Berdych and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga). Berdych won a set in their final at the Monte Carlo Masters, but Tsonga was soundly beaten in straight sets in the Shanghai Masters final 6-2, 6-4.

The worst beatings inflicted by Djokovic during the streak were both against Nadal. Djokovic crushed the Spaniard 6-1, 6-2 in January's Qatar Open. He also surrendered a paltry four games to Nadal in last season's Beijing final.

At the moment, those statistics don't mean much to Djokovic, who was clearly disturbed by the unexpected eye condition.

""My match record is the least of my thoughts at this moment,"" Djokovic said. ""I just hope that this problem will fade away in the next few days.""

Eye problems have rarely, if ever, been the source of retirements or walkovers. Players take the utility and reliability of healthy eyes for granted, which is all the more reason for Djokovic to feel concerned about this surprise development. The injury came suddenly at a time when Djokovic appears to be in the best shape of his life -- physically, mentally and emotionally.

Editor's Picks Djokovic quits Dubai match with eye infection Top-seeded Novak Djokovic retired from his quarterfinal match against Feliciano Lopez at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Thursday after losing the first set.

This was an unexpectedly cruel blow. The timing is awkward, with a World Group first-round Davis Cup tie that Djokovic is committed to play against Kazakhstan approaching in the first week in March, followed by the two big U.S. hard-court Masters events. Djokovic has a solid week to take care of his eye problem before he needs to think about Davis Cup. He's lucky in that the tie will be played in Belgrade, Serbia.

Just the other day in Dubai, Djokovic revealed that he's dedicated to making the most of his current comprehensive superiority.

""I try not to be overconfident, but being at the peak of my career at the moment, I'm trying to use this momentum that I have, take everything out of myself, and achieve more.""

Djokovic's ambitions suffered a temporary setback in Dubai, but he still hasn't been beaten fair and square by an ATP rival since Federer tagged him in a round-robin match at the ATP World Tour Finals last November.

The streak is dead; long live the streak.",[]

Murray looked down and out, a break down at the start of the fifth set against Kei Nishikori and on course to lose his first match from two sets up since 2005 as an 18-year-old at Wimbledon.

But somehow he dragged himself and his country over the line to a 7-5, 7-6(6), 3-6, 4-6, 6-3 victory that completed a 3-1 win over Japan. It was a marathon contest that lasted two minutes shy of five hours; a spectacular war of attrition. The fifth set alone lasted 81 minutes.

""He's just a man of steel, isn't he?"" was Great Britain captain Leon Smith's verdict. The world No.2 was certainly Superman at the Barclaycard Arena on Sunday.

Editor's Picks Czechs, Serbia reach Davis Cup quarterfinals The Czech Republic, bidding for its third Davis Cup championships in five years, were among winners to advance to the quarterfinals Sunday.

Murray looked like he was running on fumes, but, he said in his on-court interview between gasps for breath: ""The crowd helped for sure.

""I was struggling a little bit at the end of the third, little bit throughout the fourth. There were long rallies, he was pushing my quite far off the baseline. I was trying to keep the points short. In the fifth I decided to grit my teeth and give everything, and managed to get the win.

""I was a little bit calmer in the fifth. I was getting very frustrated and panicking a bit in the third when I was struggling a bit physically. I was quite down on myself. In the fifth I went back to what I was doing in the first. I was pumped up, had more positive energy. I fought for every point.""

Murray's feats this weekend in helping Great Britain win three more rubbers are all the more incredible given he hadn't played since the Australian Open, following the birth of daughter Sophia last month.

""It's Kim's first Mother's Day, so it's nice to get to see her this evening,"" he added. ""I'll try to get back for bath time, I'll try to put her to sleep -- not Kim, the baby!""

This was the first time Murray had played a five-setter in Davis Cup singles since he beat Marin Cilic in September 2007. He is now 18-7 when it has gone to a decider.

This was the highest-ranked opponent Murray had ever faced in the Davis Cup, but he dug deep to come through this toughest of tests and put defending champions Great Britain into the quarterfinals, where they will play Novak Djokovic's Serbia, who overcame Kazakhstan 3-2. The first day of the tie will be played on July 15 -- just five days after the Wimbledon final.

""He's just a man of steel, isn't he?"" GB captain Leon Smith on Andy Murray

It was Great Britain's 150th tie win in the competition, and Murray's 14th consecutive victory over singles and doubles rubbers.

That run comprised 11 points in 2015 as the Scot drove Great Britain to its first Davis Cup title for 79 years. He has already helped deliver three more to back up his defiant vow that he will do everything in his power to help retain the trophy.

""Last year's experience was incredible for everyone on the team,"" added Murray. ""Every time I've played I've really enjoyed it. This team has done something special last year. I would like to try and do the same again this year if we can. The next match will be extremely tough but if we all stick together and fight, we have a chance.""

Murray certainly showing spades of fighting spirit here. Nishikori set the tone for the day in the very first game, with Murray forced to produce a big second serve to save break point. Great Britain had a fight on their hands.

In a first set punctuated by a series of mammoth rallies, Murray edged one more to take it after an hour and two minutes.

He was warned for racket abuse having gone a break down at the start of the second set but gave the perfect response by reeling off two games in a row to lead 3-2.

Failing to take two set points at 6-5, Murray burst into a 4-0 lead in the tie-break but was swiftly 5-4, before having to save set point with a thunderous ace.

Murray then brought up a set point of his own and Nishikori cracked under the pressure, dumping a forehand into the net. The world No.6 was visibly devastated, hunching over and staring at the floor while Murray bounced back to his seat.

However, Nishikori refused to lie down and quietened the usually-raucous Stirling Uni Barmy Army by pouncing on a tiring Murray to reel off the third and fourth sets.

It looked like Dan Evans was going to required to rescue Great Britain in a fifth rubber against Yoshihito Nishioka with Murray broken immediately at the start of the decider.

An incredible fifth set saw four more breaks of serve, with Murray striking the vital blow to move 4-2 ahead.

""One more game,"" shouted the Barmy Army at 5-2, then not long after, ""one more point"" after Murray brought up three match points. He took the second and the Barclaycard Arena emitted an almighty roar.

""It would've been a great chance for Dan to play the fifth match here, but thankfully I managed to get through. I think everyone's seen enough tennis, they can go home and rest.""

If the quality of tennis had been as high as it was in this match, the crowd may not have minded a fifth rubber at all.

""I'm pretty much lost for words at this stage,"" said Smith. ""We have to give a lot of credit to Kei, he played a great match, one of the best matches of his life for sure. But you look at Andy, not just today, the other two matches, it's quite astonishing given he hasn't played since the Australian Open final.

""It's a privilege to sit here for a match like that, I'll remember this one for a long time.""",[]

The team might not be as showy as the group that brought home the organization's first League Championship Series trophy last summer, but it is built to last, grinding out victories through well-guided leadership and the idea of five men working as one.

The reigning champion is 10-4, holding down second place in the NA LCS heading into the Intel Extreme Masters World Championships in Poland, fresh off ending first-place Immortals' perfect spring split.

Editor's Picks CLG's Darshan reflects on ending Immortals' perfect NA LCS split After 12 consecutive wins to open the NA LCS spring split, Immortals finally fell at the hands of Counter Logic Gaming. Darshan reflects on that win, and looks forward at CLG's prospects.

Aphromoo rises to the occasion as captain of CLG CLG, the defending League of Legends North American champions, were expected to falter after offseason setbacks, but captain Zaqueri ""Aphromoo"" Black had something to say about that.

League of Legends global power rankings through Week 7 Fact: The ROX Tigers are currently the best team, and COUGAR E-sport are the worst, but at least the COUGAR's didn't die to Rift Herald. 2 Related

At the center of the rebuilt CLG is someone simultaneously new and old to this team. Choi ""Huhi"" Jae-hyun sat on the bench for the entire summer season behind now-Immortals mid laner Eugene ""Pobelter"" Park. After dealing with visa issues at the beginning of his CLG tenure, he was never able to crack the starting lineup as his team performed so well throughout their championship split. Pobelter's departure during the offseason, following the team's disappointing exit at the world championships, allowed Huhi to have free rein over CLG's mid lane position.

While the team has played together for only a few months, this split's CLG already has an IEM under its belt. It made a surprising run to the finals of IEM San Jose, with a victory over South Korea's Jin Air Green Wings in the semifinals before falling to the much more experienced and synergized Origen in the final.

A lot of that is thanks to the play of Huhi -- and his ability to mesh so well with his teammates.

""The biggest difference is definitely the atmosphere,"" Huhi said about the changes he has experienced after going from playing on a Korean team early in his career to playing on a North American squad this year. ""In Korea, the team treated [a] player as part of a machine. They can replace [players] at any time. Players are very serious, so they only sleep seven hours and rest of the day is solo queue, scrims, solo queue, scrims, and don't really take breaks. That's how [Korea] got better, I guess, but it's why they get burned out earlier than NA players.

""In NA, [though], they're really friendly -- like coaches and players are really friendly. There is a lot of communication going on. Sometimes it can be bad because it gives a bad atmosphere on the team [with] the team arguing too much. But the other way, if you're open to criticism on how to get better, then I think it's the perfect atmosphere.""

CLG's mid laner believes the reason for his team's success this season comes from that positive, flexible atmosphere. Everyone on the team is open to talking to one another about issues, and the entire team gets along inside and outside of the game. While some teams preach that their team is unified, CLG players treat each other like family. When they have time off, they still choose to hang out with one another because of how much fun they have together as friends.

Huhi and his CLG teammates celebrate after ending Immortals' undefeated NA LCS spring split -- a big win for the team that currently sits in second against the league leaders. Riot Games

""When I was in NA for Thanksgiving, every teammate invited me to their house,"" Huhi said. ""We're not close [just] because it's our job.""

Huhi's current form is representative of how CLG is chugging along as a unit. Although he's known for possessing a fair bit of technical skill, the South Korean talent hasn't had the greatest season, with only two weeks left to play. His damage output has been good, but his mispositioning at times -- and knack for getting caught -- has hamstrung his teammates on occasion. Even though it might not be the individual season he had hoped for, his team play along with the rest of CLG on a macro level has taken CLG to greater heights than people believed possible.

CLG doesn't mind being the underdog -- in fact, it enjoys it. Talk about the other teams and hype them up. Huhi and the rest of Counter Logic are happy to have a chip on their shoulders as they roll along. Going into IEM Katowice -- and a date with world champion SK Telecom T1 in the first round -- it'll be another chance to prove critics wrong.

""If possible, I'll try to be selfish as possible,"" Huhi replied with a laugh, when asked what he thought about going up against the game's greatest player, Lee ""Faker"" Sang-hyeok, in Round 1. ""Until now, I was trying to give all the resources to my team. But it's Faker, so I want to try and solo kill him . . . I'll try to play more aggressive.""

Another mid laner who interests Huhi at Katowice will be the Qiao Gu Reapers' Kim ""Doinb"" Tae-sang. The two players came up through the amateur ranks together, constantly facing each other in solo queue as they searched for a reliable, longstanding team to call home.

Interestingly enough, it could have been Huhi wearing the Reapers uniform if a few things had gone differently.

""Before I came to CLG, I had some conversations about me joining QG,"" he said. ""So I talked to Doinb because we were both mid laners, and then I decided to come to CLG. It'll be pretty interesting because I used to verse him a lot in solo queue when we were both amateurs. So it'll be really different -- he'll have a different playstyle now in the LPL.""

While winning IEM is the goal of every team embarking for Poland, Huhi wants to use the unique opportunity to play against international competition to sharpen his team's condition.

""I, personally, want to learn as much [as possible] from the other regions,"" he said. ""Obviously, Korean teams have better micromanagement and map movement than other regions, so that's definitely one thing I want to improve on.""

Always open to improvement. Always maturing as a team. They might not have the pound-for-pound talent of some of the other teams heading to Poland, but that's OK -- CLG's players don't care if they're the so-called best at their roles.

They care only about being the best team.",[]

Look at massively multiplayer online role-playing games. MMORPGs thrive on multiplayer -- it's right there in the name -- and financially, they're a multibillion-dollar industry. Yet as far as esports are concerned, MMORPGs are little more than a footnote. They might be fun to play, but they're not always fun to watch.

That's a problem. After all, an esport lives and dies by its viewers. According to a study published by SuperData Research, about 80 percent of esports earnings come from advertisements, sponsorships and ticket sales. If a game doesn't appeal to spectators, the audience will tune out. If nobody is watching, nobody gets paid.

MMORPGs' lack of esports success doesn't come from a lack of trying. Take World of Warcraft, for example. Blizzard Entertainment has a great record with esports -- it publishes StarCraft II, Hearthstone, and Heroes of the Storm -- but its attempts to turn its MMO juggernaut into an esports contender have fallen flat time and time again.

The old vanguard

See, World of Warcraft was designed as a cooperative game, not a competitive one. WoW debuted in 2004, but Blizzard didn't add player-versus-player arenas to the game until 2007. At first, arena matches were extremely popular with both viewers and competitors, and World of Warcraft tournaments sprung up all over the world.

It didn't last. Blizzard's developers ran into problems balancing the player-versus-player combat, alienating non-competitive Warcraft players, while making competitions feel unfair. In 2010, the biggest third-party tournament organizer, Major League Gaming, dropped World of Warcraft from its lineup, citing issues with the game's spectating software.

That's not to say that there isn't an audience for competitive World of Warcraft. On Twitch, thousands of viewers tune in to watch players like Jackson ""Bajheera"" Bliton, winner of Blizzard's 2014 Best World of Warcraft PvP Streamer award. Currently, Bliton has over 250,000 followers and close to 18 million views, most of which came from broadcasting Warcraft's player-versus-player content.

World of Warcraft is a popular game on Twitch, but it only gets a small fraction of the viewers who watch esports-friendly titles like League of Legends and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Bliton offered some thoughts on why.

For one, players who watch World of Warcraft streams aren't necessarily interested in the matches themselves; instead, they want to see how high-level players operate in order to improve their own games.

In addition, Bliton says, World of Warcraft's cooperation-first game design, which splits characters into a ""holy trinity"" of classes (tank, healer and DPS), ""can be too complicated for someone who is unfamiliar with the game to fully understand."" Most esports have a team-based element, but in World of Warcraft, inter-team dynamics are so important that it can be hard to follow the action. There's also an issue with Warcraft's user interface. According to Bliton, World of Warcraft characters' health bars go up and down so quickly that it's difficult for the average viewer to tell if a particular play is important, making it challenging to identify which side is actually winning.

Blizzard still holds an annual arena competition with a $250,000 prize pool, but otherwise, arena's days as a viable esports competition seem pretty much over. The company knows it, too. In 2009, World of Warcraft lead designer Rob Pardo called arenas World of Warcraft's ""biggest mistake."" Recently, CEO Mike Morhaime reaffirmed Blizzard's commitment to esports, yet didn't list World of Warcraft among the company's esports-friendly games.

The failure of the biggest and most famous MMORPG to gain traction in the esports scene makes things difficult for other MMO developers. If a game with World of Warcraft's reputation can't cut it, what hope do other games have?

The new challengers

Korean publisher NCSoft is eager to find out. While NCSoft's Blade and Soul came out in Korea in 2012, it didn't arrive on Western shores until last month. Since then, it's racked up over two million players in North America and Europe, thanks primarily to its esports-ready player-versus-player combat.

Last fall, NCSoft held a successful $35,000 Blade and Soul tournament in Korea; this year, the company will invite competitors from Europe and North America to participate as well. In the meantime, Western Blade and Soul players are hosting community tournaments in order to keep their skills sharp. So far, the response has been overwhelmingly positive.

According to NCSoft brand manager Julianne Harty, there's a good reason why Blade and Soul is succeeding where other MMORPGs have failed. ""Any sport-related activity needs to be easy to pick up but difficult to master, and your proficiency in the sport should not be reliant upon the type of equipment that you use,"" she saidl. In most MMORPGs, combat is driven by gear and statistics. In Blade and Soul, it's reflex and strategy-based, more like Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat than a traditional role-playing game.

""This means that being competitive [in Blade and Soul] requires skill and knowledge,"" Harty said. ""It becomes entirely about the player themselves rather than the choice of class or the equipment of the character."" Statistically, every player has an equal chance at winning, meaning that competitions come down to talent alone. That's less mechanical, and far more exciting.

ArenaNet, the company behind Guild Wars 2, has a similar philosophy. Guild Wars 2 associate game director John Corpening said, ""When we set out to bring Guild Wars 2 into [esports], we decided to focus first on making it a sport. It had to be something where player skill made a difference.""

Like Blade and Soul, Guild Wars 2 equalizes players' stats. Equipment doesn't give competitors advantages, and every class is self-reliant. Character builds are extremely flexible, allowing players to customize their characters to their own play styles, but Guild Wars' combat is fairly simple. Many MMORPGs load characters down with skills and abilities. In Guild Wars 2, players only have a few options. That makes PvP less about memorization, and more about using skills correctly.

Courtesy of Guild Wars 2

In some ways, Guild Wars 2's PvP is even more accessible than Blade and Soul. In Blade and Soul, players won't have all the skills they need to be real contenders until they reach the highest levels of the player-versus-environment game. In Guild Wars 2, everything a player needs for PvP is unlocked from the very beginning. Simply download the Guild Wars 2 client, log in with a free account, and you're ready to play.

All of these features were present when Guild Wars 2 launched in 2012, and unlike World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2's esports fandom grew organically. For the first two years of the game's lifespan, Guild Wars 2's competitive scene was made up entirely of community-run tournaments, complete with fan-funded prize pools.

As a result, there was already a fandom in place when ArenaNet started promoting Guild Wars 2 as an esports title. That patience has paid off.

Since ArenaNet started hosting official tournaments, the number of people playing competitive Guild Wars 2 has more than doubled, and PvP is currently the game's fastest-growing segment. The launch of ArenaNet and ESL's Guild Wars 2 Pro League (a quarterly competition with a $100,000 prize pool) should accelerate that expansion. During the Pro League's first season, which ended in late February, players spent twice as much time as in PvP combat. Season 2 just started, and so far, the amount of time that players are spending in the game is at an all-time high.

It helps that both Blade and Soul and Guild Wars 2 are easy to watch. In Guild Wars 2, the low number of skills and the equalized statistics keep things simple for viewers. In Blade and Soul, the user interface actually tells the match's entire story. ""Many of the skills and animations are visually exciting,"" Harty said. ""You can see a character knock down another, climb atop their prone body and smash their face with a handful of punches before jumping off."" Blade and Soul's PvP matches unfold like a 1970s kung-fu flick, and viewers don't need to know much about Blade and Soul to know that when an attack hurts.

Rez, plz

World of Warcraft isn't done just yet, however. Olivia Grace, World of Warcraft's esports manager, acknowledges that Warcraft and its ilk haven't always handled spectating well, but promises that things are getting better.

""We're constantly looking at ways to make arena easier to follow and more fun to watch,"" Grace says. ""We've shifted slightly away from the green-versus-gold team colors, which didn't broadcast too well, and added indicators underneath the characters' feet to show which team they're part of.""

In addition, World of Warcraft's last expansion added ""Spectated Wargames,"" which made broadcasting arena matches easier for third-party organizers. Previously, accounts needed a special setting to watch matches, and tournaments were held on special servers. Now, anyone can set up their own games on the fly, and can ""film"" the action using a special in-game camera.

Despite the history, Blizzard still stands by arenas, but it's also looking into alternatives, too.

""One big opportunity for us is to expand World of Warcraft esports to include some of the other activities the game offers,"" Grace says. ""In 2015, we started experimenting with some different kinds of competition in partnership with some third-party tournament organizers.""

Editor's Picks Riding on rocket fuel - Rocket League and esports Part sport sim, part video game, the rocket-powered Rocket League mixes soccer and RC cars to create charming, appreciable experiences. But can it break into the esports mainstream?

A few weeks ago, Blizzard broadcast a series of timed races, in which teams of players from the United States and Europe went head-to-head in a sprint through in-game dungeons. It was a different type of competition for Blizzard, and one that was substantially more accessible than traditional arena contests. The races embraced the team-based dungeon-crawling that made World of Warcraft famous, and yet didn't require any special knowledge to understand. A race is a race. It's easy to tell who's winning, and who's falling behind.

Dungeon races might not make it into World of Warcraft's next expansion. ""There's a lot in Azeroth that could form the basis of a fun esport,"" Grace says. ""The tricky part is figuring out which to focus our energy on first.""

Still, the experiment represents a new and encouraging attitude from Blizzard: Instead of bolting on features to make Warcraft more like existing esports, developers are figuring out what the game already does well, and then building an esport out of that.

That approach is paying off for NCSoft and ArenaNet, and there's no reason to think that it won't work for Blizzard and World of Warcraft as well -- as long as esports viewers give World of Warcraft a chance. Ultimately, Blizzard's biggest hurdle might not be a design problem, but a public relations one: esports need viewers, and with competition like Blade and Soul and Guild Wars 2, World of Warcraft can't afford to alienate fans again.",[]

Adam Scott is on a roll, and he's understandably on a list of favorites being tossed about to win next month's Masters.

The 2013 champion at Augusta National, Scott, 35, has won consecutive starts after finishing second at the Northern Trust Open, and you have to love the way he has gotten it done at the Honda Classic and WGC-Cadillac Championship, overcoming some big numbers along the way.

But if history tells us anything, it is that winning in Florida is no guarantee for success at the Masters. Jordan Spieth bucked that trend last year when he captured the Valspar Championship, where he defends his title this week at Innisbrook.

Editor's Picks High should help out at Valspar Championship With completely redone greens at this week's PGA Tour stop -- Innisbrook's Copperhead Course -- high-ball hitters might be a prudent play for your DFS team.

Precursor to Snake Pit could portend Valspar champion How could one of the shortest holes on the Copperhead course be so important? Michael Collins explains why in this week's ""Notes From The Yardage Book.""

Resilient Scott proves again he belongs in golf's elite To say Adam Scott knows how to roll with the punches after his back-to-back victories misses the point about how the Aussie has showed that character trait for much of his career. 2 Related

It was the first time in 10 years -- since Tiger Woods won at Bay Hill in 2005 -- that a player won in Florida and went on to win the Masters.

Scott is the first player since Woods in 2001 -- he went on to win the Masters that year too -- to win consecutive starts in Florida.

""I'd love to bottle up where my game's been the last couple of weeks and move forward a month,'' Scott said after his victory at Doral. ""That's going to be the hard thing for me to do, is manage my expectations and manage my game to keep it right there.''

2. The other end of the scoreboard

While Scott was winning at Doral, fellow Aussie Steven Bowdich was looking to crawl into a bunker. That he played all four rounds and didn't complain or withdraw was a testament to him, because the scorecard can be cruel.

Bowdich, who has two PGA Tour victories, shot all four rounds in the 80s, becoming the first player in at least 30 years to do so on the PGA Tour in a four-round tournament. (It would be almost impossible to do so in anything other than a WGC event, as consecutive 80s would cause a player to miss the cut.) Bowdich finished 37 over par -- or 49 strokes behind Scott. It was obviously a tough week and he was struggling -- it can happen at Doral -- but his plight helps put in perspective Woods' ability to avoid shooting in the 80s.

In his entire career, Woods has shot the same number of rounds in the 80s -- four -- as Bowdich did in one tournament. And three of Tiger's came in 2015.

3. The man has a sense of humor

Give Bowdich credit. Not only did he withstand shooting four rounds in the 80s -- ""Hey, it's just golf,'' he said -- but he also managed to reach out to Scott via Twitter and have a laugh.

Seems about right.. Well done Scotty!! Told you that you wouldn't get me by 50! pic.twitter.com/3uKWkdWeEg  Steven Bowditch (@bowdo83) March 7, 2016

4. Match Play tweak

The World Golf Championship match play event has a new home, a new sponsor, a new date and a slightly new format.

The WGC-Dell Match Play takes place in two weeks -- and two weeks prior to the Masters -- at the Austin Country Club. And after the event last year went to a round-robin format for the first time (instead of straight knock out), it will now also allow for ties during the first three days.

In the inaugural attempt at a round-robin format, the rules called for matches that ended in ties to play off. That meant several instances where a Friday match -- you play the other three golfers in your group one time -- meant nothing, that both players had already been eliminated from reaching the Round of 16.

Ties will make that less likely, with any ties after the third session being decided with a playoff to reach the Round of 16.

5. Excellent timing

Woods opened a 10-hole short course last week at BlueJack National, the golf course he designed outside of Houston. It is his first domestic design, with nine holes open for play along with the 10 short holes he unveiled. And there could not have been any better publicity for the project when Woods was there to witness Taylor Crozier, 11, take the first swing.

First hole at The Playgrounds @BluejackNation and this happened https://t.co/ChD312oPEJ  Tiger Woods (@TigerWoods) March 3, 2016

6. Tiger's status

At the opening for BlueJack National, Woods was part of a news conference, and inevitably his status as a golfer came up. Unless he is trying to be incredibly coy and surprise the world with an early comeback, it seems Woods' return to competitive golf will not be anytime soon.

""I'm progressing slowly. I take it day by day,'' Woods said. ""That's the frustrating part. There is no timetable.''

Woods said he had not progressed beyond hitting a 9-iron, and it would seem unlikely that tournament golf could be in his immediate future following months of no competition.

7. Rickie's ace for autism

Ernie Els has an annual event on the Monday following the Doral tournament to raise funds for autism at Old Palm in West Palm Beach, Florida. He has set up a foundation called Els for Autism and typically gets a lot of support among PGA Tour pros. That's where Rickie Fowler comes in, having participated in the event -- and then topping it off by making an ace that meant a $1 million prize for the foundation.

Els was understandably thrilled.

Woke up today thinking I dreamt about @RickieFowler making an ace for $1m for @ElsForAutism. Then I watched this... pic.twitter.com/OKelejax8y  Ernie Els (@TheBig_Easy) March 8, 2016

8. Champions Tour

John Daly turns 50 at the end of April and won't waste any time making his Champions Tour debut the following week at the Insperity Invitational near Houston. ""I'm coming in fresh,'' Daly said in a conference call. ""I really don't have any expectations. Just to go play and do the best I can.''

Daly is ranked 933rd in the world and has not been fully exempt on the PGA Tour since 2006. He has spent most of the past decade playing on sponsor exemptions. In his past 29 worldwide starts, Daly has missed 18 cuts, with his best finish a tie for 10th last year at the Puerto Rico Open.

9. Woe is Dustin Johnson

What happened? Johnson was 8 under par and playing in the final twosome with Rory McIlroy, firmly in contention at the WGC-Cadillac Championship, just a stroke behind eventual champion Scott. Then he hit his tee shot in the water at the par-5 10th hole and fell apart.

Johnson played the first four holes on the back nine in 7 over par, making three double-bogeys and a bogey. He did add a birdie to shoot 42 for the final nine holes and finished with a 79 -- a full 10 strokes back of Scott and in a tie for 14th.",[]

espn.com,,Jessica Ennis-Hill urges sporting mums to speak out,"['Peter Keating', 'Bill Barnwell', 'Chris Forsberg', 'Wayne Drehs', 'Eric Williams', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Sue Mott', 'Chad Ford', 'Royce Young', 'Jeff Goodman']","It shouldn't be such a surprise, really, having mothers out there on the track. Not in a garland-holding, tear-dabbing, emoji-moment capacity but in full kit, at the coal face, on the start line, competing.

Of course it happened with some blatancy back in 1948 when Dutch sprinter and mother-of-two Fanny Blankers-Koen won four gold medals at the London Olympics. Commentators called her ""The Flying Housewife"", perhaps to reassure themselves she was still more at home among pots and pans than the heavily male-dominated world of amateur sport.

So hail the difference in 2016. No-one is going to call Jessica Ennis-Hill a ""flying"" or any other kind of ""housewife"".

She is an athlete, reigning Olympic and world heptathlon champion, and mother to Reggie, who will be two when she competes at the age of 30 in Rio this summer -- injury and Zika virus allowing.

The world of sport has moved on since 1948, it has edged closer to a level playing field between the genders so that the competitive will of mothers -- with spectacularly good child care -- can be accommodated and not thwarted by the system.

Editor's Picks Ennis-Hill coach wants GB Olympics camp moved Jessica Ennis-Hill's coach Toni Minichiello has called for the British Olympic Association to move the preparation camp for the Rio Olympics to a zika-free zone.

""More women are becoming sporting mums and you take inspiration from them,"" Ennis-Hill said. ""You see what they're doing and think maybe I can do it too.

""It's important that everyone shares their experience. You have so much conflicting evidence when you're pregnant. Whether you should train, whether you should rest, whether you should do nothing or a bit of running.

""But being a mum makes me a little bit more relaxed. It also makes me realise that if I don't do as well as I want to -- training or competing -- it's not the end of the world. I've got this amazing little boy at home and he's my world.""

""You can definitely have a child, step away from your sport and then come back into it. You just have to make sure you do it sensibly.""

Kim Clijsters provided a great example of a successful comeback in 2009, reclaiming her world No.1 ranking and winning the US Open after 'retiring' for a couple of years and giving birth to daughter Jada.

Paula Radcliffe also bounced back from giving birth, training through pregnancy and winning the New York Marathon in 2007, the same year she brought daughter Isla into the world. And British compatriot Jo Pavey became the European Championships' oldest female gold medallist in 2014, winning the 10,000m aged 40 and 11 months after giving birth to her second child.

Then there was Candace Parker, who became a mum in 2009 and only missed eight games before she was back playing for the L.A. Sparks basketball side, and former U.S. Soccer captain Christie Rampone, who took one of her children, Rylie, on a team trip when the baby was only three months old. She also said training runs pushing her buggy were a favourite when working away from the squad.

The path of a quick return to sport is not for all new mums, of course, but the successful examples certainly make the stories of those who have taken that route is compelling.

The message is that sportswomen have a choice. Tricky, potentially exhausting, requiring extraordinary organisation, but possible -- even sometimes preferable on all sorts of physical and emotional levels -- nonetheless.

If Blankers-Koen was an aberration in the last century, Ennis-Hill may be a high-profile example of the 21st century's norm.

But loading offspring into the training schedule is not for everyone. Liverpool's Katarina Johnson-Thompson, the younger rival to Ennis-Hill in the heptathlon, has no intention of supplanting the dachshunds in her life for babies at this stage.

""I've got so much admiration for Jess,"" Johnson-Thompson said. ""She's definitely an example to women and what they can do. But no, I'm just going to get more dogs. I've got Chorizo and Bronx and I think I'm going to finish up with six by the time my career's over. Their faces are so cute.""

KJT, as she has become known, swapped dancing lessons for athletics at the age of 11 and is a realistic challenger to Ennis-Hill for the Olympic title at 23. Even in that relatively short career span she has noticed evident progress in women's sport.

""Sport is more accessible to women these days. You can just see it on line. Women, girls, posting all sort of stories about sport. It's not seen as a manly thing to do. It's seen as healthy. To keep fit. I like what's happening.

""When I was growing up, it was the size-zero trend. Girls weren't supposed to like sport -- too muscly, to manly. That's gone now. It's good. It's healthy.""

At Liverpool Harriers, where she trains with coach Mike Holmes, there are significantly more female members than male. Johnson-Thompson's explanation was that the men were more into football, being a passionate Liverpool fan herself.

But the preponderance of women at the club only intensifies the workload, according to Holmes, a credible expert with a career in coaching stretching back to 1984.

""I've found over the years, the toughest, most resilient athletes, are women. When it comes down to the hard yards, giving that extra bit.

""There was a girl recently when I was there with Kat. She was going at her training really hard. I said to her: 'You must be training for something?' She said: 'No, I'm just training.' I stood back in admiration, watching this woman grafting. I admire her and women like her so much.""

Imagine that. Where once women were deemed hussies for flashing a bit of ankle, required to expend pent-up energy on embroidery and deep sighing, now they can sweat, graft and grow muscle fibres with impunity.

The Ennis-Hill vs. KJT showdown will be one of the great spectacles of Rio 2016 if the gods are willing. One of them a mum in her 30s, the other an unfazed aspirant with two beloved pets she will be sad to leave at home.

According to the Wall Street Journal and Legal Sports Report, about 20 states already have pending legislation that would largely permit fantasy sports of the daily variety. Most of the proposed laws emphasize consumer protection and are viewed favorably by DFS operators.

The setbacks have been headline-grabbing, however.

Since October 2015, several states have labeled DFS as a form of illegal gambling. But the way in which each state moved forward afterwards reveals how fractured the landscape can be when archaic laws enacted as far back as a century ago are put face-to-face with innovative, tech-driven fantasy contests of today.

A state-by-state march toward legal acceptance will likely be long and bumpy. Fantasy Sports Trade Association president Paul Charchian estimated that it would be a multi-year process.

""We're going to battle and we're going to win,"" Charchian said in his remarks at the January 2016 FSTA conference in Dallas. ""We need to formally legalize fantasy play in 50 states.""

Chalk provides a bite-sized summary of the current status of DFS in all 50 states, with updates to follow as news warrants.

Allowed states (5)

Kansas

On April 24, 2015, Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt released a six-page memo generally favorable to fantasy sports play, although the memo does not touch on DFS specifically. ""If fantasy sports leagues fall within the definition provided in [the law], then fantasy sports leagues are games of skill and therefore are not lotteries,"" the memo concluded. ""Under federal law, Congress has determined that fantasy sports leagues are games of skill."" The Kansas legislature does not appear to be considering a DFS bill.

Maryland

Maryland is one of the few states to already address fantasy sports. ""Maryland law specifically exempts fantasy sports contests from its gambling laws,"" noted a 2014 legal opinion letter sent to FanDuel. Indeed, the Maryland legislature passed a fantasy-friendly law in 2012. The Maryland attorney general recently questioned whether the 2012 law extended to DFS and has asked the legislature to provide clarity on this point. A new DFS-specific law is being considered by lawmakers now.

Massachusetts

DFS has garnered a lot of attention in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. ""I think anybody looking at this acknowledges it's a form of gambling,"" Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in widely reported November 2015 comments. ""Just because it's gambling doesn't make it illegal."" Indeed, cash-based DFS is generally considered legal. However, AG Healey has proposed certain consumer protection policies. In addition, the Massachusetts Gaming Commission released a 50-page paper regarding daily fantasy sports on Jan. 11, 2016.

Rhode Island

Daily fantasy was given a stamp of approval in early 2016. ""It is the opinion of this office that daily fantasy sports may currently operate legally,"" Rhode Island Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin wrote in a Feb. 4, 2016, letter to Governor Gina Raimondo. ""Applying the 'dominant factor' standard, I do not believe that daily fantasy sports constitute a 'game of chance.'"" A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced in the state, a move that was recommended by AG Kilmartin.

Virginia

Governor Terry McAuliffe signed the ""Fantasy Contests Act"" into law on March 7, 2016. The new law legalizes pay-to-play DFS in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Operators must pay a licensing fee and are subject to other regulations.

Recently contested states (9)

Georgia

""[D]aily fantasy sports games are not authorized under Georgia law,"" wrote two lawyers from the office of Georgia attorney general Samuel S. Olens in a four-page letter dated Feb. 26, 2016. The letter follows a Sept. 23, 2015, letter from the Georgia Lottery to top executives at FanDuel and DraftKings to ""inquire about the legal authority for FanDuel and DraftKings to independently operate fantasy sports games within the state of Georgia."" DFS-related legislation was introduced, but has stalled.

Hawaii

In January, Hawaii Attorney General Doug Chin concluded that DFS contests constitute illegal gambling under state law. A follow-up letter from a Honolulu prosecuting attorney instructed leading DFS providers to cease operating in the state. A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced.

Illinois

Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan concluded that pay-to-play daily fantasy is illegal under state law. ""It is my opinion that the daily fantasy sports contests offered by FanDuel and DraftKings clearly constitute gambling,"" AG Madigan wrote in a Dec. 23, 2015, memo. Litigation involving FanDuel and DraftKings remains ongoing, with both companies continuing to operate in the state. At the same time, Illinois lawmakers are considering DFS legislation.

Mississippi

""Fantasy sports wagering is illegal in the state of Mississippi under current law,"" Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood wrote in a January 2016 decision. Since the ruling, AG Hood has not moved to enforce the ruling via litigation or otherwise. A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced in the state.

Nevada

In October 2015, the Nevada attorney general deemed DFS to constitute gambling. In a detailed 17-page decision, the office of the attorney general concluded that ""daily fantasy sports cannot be offered in Nevada without licensure."" All daily fantasy providers vacated the state soon thereafter. To date, no leading DFS company has applied for and been granted a gaming license in Nevada. The Nevada Gaming Policy Committee is currently evaluating current and future options for DFS in the state.

New York

More so than other states, DFS has garnered headlines in New York as a result of Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's cease-and-desist order directed at DraftKings and FanDuel and the litigation that followed. On Dec. 11 , 2015 AG Schneiderman received a favorable ruling from Supreme Court Judge Manuel J. Mendez. However, hours later, Judge Mendez's order was suspended via a ""stay"" from an appellate court. Both FanDuel and DraftKings remain in operation in New York as the litigation proceeds.

A considerable amount of attention in the court case to date has centered on whether DFS should be considered a permissible skill-based contest. According to a 2014 legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, New York follows a ""material factor"" test. ""This is a lesser standard than the predominance test and effectively makes it more difficult to offer skill-based gaming,"" wrote the author of a different 2013 legal opinion letter. Multiple legislative bills pertaining to DFS have been introduced in the state.

South Dakota

Daily fantasy sports have the attention of Attorney General Marty Jackley. ""Based upon the current state of uncertainty, including the ongoing debate on whether daily fantasy sports wagering is predominately a permissive game of skill or an unlawful game of chance, it will not be my intent to seek felony indictments here in South Dakota absent a clear directive from our state legislature,"" AG Jackley wrote in a December 2015 statement. DFS is not currently being considered by the South Dakota legislature.

Texas

""Because the outcomes of games in daily fantasy sports leagues depends partially on chance, an individual's payment of a fee to participate in such activities is a bet,"" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in a nine-page Jan. 19, 2016, decision. ""Accordingly, a court would likely determine that participation in daily fantasy sports is illegal gambling."" In early March, FanDuel reached a settlement agreement with AG Paxton and will exit the state in May of 2016. DraftKings filed a lawsuit against AG Paxton on March 4 and continues to operate in the Lone Star State. There is no legislative activity pertaining to DFS in the state.

Vermont

In a widely reported January decision, the Vermont attorney general concluded that daily fantasy games constitute illegal gambling under state law. A legislative bill that would legalize DFS has been introduced in the state.

Historically banned states (5)

Arizona

Arizona is one of five states where cash-based DFS play has long been considered banned. A prior attorney general opinion found fantasy football to be considered gambling. In November 2015, the Boston Globe reported that Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich sent letters to DraftKings and FanDuel asking about the status of player accounts in the state. A legislative bill to legalize DFS is pending.

Iowa

The state bans play in games ""for any sum of money."" However, a DFS-related legislative bill is pending before the Iowa legislature.

Louisiana

In 1991, then-Attorney General William J. Guste, Jr. concluded that a 1-900 number fantasy football contest constituted illegal gambling, but nothing in the 1991 memo touched on DFS-specific issues. The Louisiana legislature is not considering a DFS bill during the current session.

Montana

Under state law, Internet-based fantasy sports leagues are illegal. Montana is not currently considering any amendment to its law. The Montana Lottery offers fantasy football and racing contests.

Washington

In 2011, the Washington State Gambling Commission pursued criminal charges against a state resident who offered NASCAR-themed fantasy contests. However, state lawmakers held hearings in January 2016 to debate a proposed law that would define certain daily fantasy contests as games of skill and remove them from the state's overall ban on cash-based fantasy games over the Internet. Other DFS bills have been introduced, too.

Legislation pending (18)

Alabama

The Alabama legislature is currently considering a DFS consumer protection bill. According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, Alabama follows a ""predominance test"" in which the relative levels of skill and chance are measured to determine if the contest is permissible.

California

The California legislature is currently considering a DFS bill that passed an initial vote by a wide margin. Attorney General Kamala Harris may release an opinion on DFS's legality at some point in 2016. According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, gambling in California requires a ""bet or wager.""

Connecticut

According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, Connecticut follows a ""predominance test"" where the relative levels of skill and chance are measured to determine if the contest is permissible. A DFS legislative bill is pending.

Florida

DFS-friendly legislation has been introduced in the Florida Legislature and passed overwhelmingly during a preliminary vote. The bill has since stalled. In 1991, former Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth concluded that certain forms of season-long fantasy sports would likely be illegal under Florida law. Current Florida AG Pam Bondi has reportedly deferred on the issue while federal prosecutors in the Tampa area appear to be undertaking a probe.

Indiana

According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, Indiana follows a ""predominance test"" in which the relative levels of skill and chance are measured to determine if the contest is permissible. Indiana lawmakers passed a DFS statute that would permit fantasy sports generally, but ban contests based on college games. The bill is awaiting signature by Governor Mike Pence.

Kentucky

According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, Kentucky follows a ""predominance test"" in which the relative levels of skill and chance are measured to determine if the contest is permissible. A DFS legislative bill was recently introduced.

Michigan

In September 2015, a member of the Michigan Gaming Control Board questioned the legality of DFS contests, but no formal decision was ever released. According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, gambling in Michigan requires a ""bet or wager."" A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced in the state.

Minnesota

According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, Minnesota follows a ""predominance test"" in which the relative levels of skill and chance are measured to determine if the contest is permissible. DFS legislation is pending in the state.

Missouri

According to a 2014 legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, Missouri follows a ""material factor"" test.

A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced in the state.

Nebraska

According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, Nebraska follows a ""predominance test"" in which the relative levels of skill and chance are measured to determine if the contest is permissible. A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced in the state.

A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced in the state.

New Mexico

According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, New Mexico follows a ""predominance test"" in which the relative levels of skill and chance are measured to determine if the contest is permissible. A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced in the state.

Oklahoma

Wagering on games of chance is banned in Oklahoma. In 1999, according to a court filing in the New York litigation, the Oklahoma attorney general probed a private ""money hunt"" contest among dog owners competing for cash based on their dog's ability to track prey. The Oklahoma AG concluded that such cash-based contests qualified as a bet under state law. A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced in the state.

Pennsylvania

According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, Pennsylvania follows a ""predominance test"" in which the relative levels of skill and chance are measured to determine if the contest is permissible. A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced in the state.

South Carolina

According to a court document released in the New York litigation, South Carolina's definition of gambling ""includes betting money on the outcome of any 'game,' regardless of the skill involved in the game."" As such, daily fantasy's legality in South Carolina was described as ""qualified."" A legislative bill to legalize daily fantasy has been introduced.

Tennessee

Tennessee was pinpointed as a curious case by one of the recently disclosed legal opinion letters from the New York litigation. ""[T]his opinion excludes Tennessee, because the authors of this [letter] are unable to reach an opinion that would satisfy the 'more likely than not' standard,"" the letter stated. In late 2015, a spokesperson for the Tennessee attorney general confirmed to Chalk that a preliminary probe of DFS has begun. A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has also been introduced in the state.

West Virginia

According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, West Virginia follows a ""predominance test"" in which the relative levels of skill and chance are measured to determine if the contest is permissible. A DFS legislative bill is pending in the state.

A legislative bill pertaining to DFS has been introduced that would serve to specifically legalize daily fantasy in the state.

No current legislation (13)

Alaska

According to a 2014 legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, Alaska follows a ""material factor"" test. ""This is a lesser standard than the predominance test and effectively makes it more difficult to offer skill-based gaming,"" wrote the author of a different 2013 legal opinion letter. In 2001, the Alaska attorney general decided that a pay-to-play golf video game constituted illegal gambling. No current DFS legislation is pending in Alaska.

Arkansas

There is no public evidence of any government inquiry in Arkansas. However, state law generally bars ""bet[ting] any money or any valuable thing on any game of hazard or skill,"" according to a 2014 opinion letter disclosed in the New York litigation. No DFS-related legislative bill appears pending.

Colorado

According to a filing released in the New York litigation citing a ""lack of clarity in Colorado law"" as it applies to DFS, the status of daily fantasy's legality in Colorado is ""qualified."" The Colorado attorney general has yet to weigh in on DFS, and no legislative bills appear to be pending. A 2009 legal case pertaining to poker considered the level of chance that would make an activity illegal gambling.

Delaware

According to a legal opinion letter released in the New York litigation, Delaware follows a ""predominance test"" in which the relative levels of skill and chance are measured to determine if the contest is permissible. No DFS legislative bill appears pending.

Idaho

North Dakota

In a widely reported 2015 statement, North Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem said, ""If [DFS is] a game of chance, it's not likely legal, and if it's a game of skill, then it would likely be legal."" AG Stehehjem has not made any formal ruling on fantasy sports. However, in 1994, then-Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp concluded that a certain fantasy football contest may constitute an impermissible ""sports pool"" and, in turn, be considered illegal gambling. The 1994 opinion letter did not discuss DFS in its current form. Daily fantasy advertisements were recently removed from certain University of North Dakota athletic facilities. No DFS-related legislation is pending in the state.

A few notes from around the boxing world:

Former middleweight titleholder David Lemieuxs comeback fight against James De La Rosa on Saturday night at the Olympia Theater in Montreal, Lemieuxs hometown, has found an American television outlet. The card will air on Fox Deportes beginning at 10 p.m. ET. Lemieux (34-3, 31 KOs), 27, will be fighting for the first time since Gennady Golovkin stopped him in the eighth round of their title unification bout on Oct. 17 at sold-out Madison Square Garden in New York. De La Rosa (23-3, 13 KOs), 28, of San Benito, Texas, will be fighting for the first time since a fifth-round knockout loss to Hugo Centeno Jr. in December 2014.

Jose Benavidez Jr., who can no longer make 140 pounds, has vacated his interim world title and plans to fight as a welterweight. He could loom as a future challenger for newly crowned titleholder Jessie Vargas, Top Rank promoter Bob Arum, who handles both fighters, told ESPN.com. Benavidez (24-0, 16 KOs), 23, of Phoenix, claimed an interim belt by very controversial decision against Mauricio Herrera in December 2014 and made one defense, a 12th-round knockout of Jorge Paez Jr. in Phoenix last May. Benavidez was due for a nontitle welterweight bout against journeyman Sidney Siqueira in December but came in 514 pounds overweight and outpointed him in a 10-round junior middleweight fight.",[]
espn.com,,Players on the spot in the American League,"['Jerry Crasnick', 'David Schoenfield', 'Stacey Gotsulias']","Every team has one of those guys -- you know, a player with the ""what if"" attached to his name. What if he stays healthy? What if he puts it all together? What if he learns to lay off that slider off the plate or just throws a few more strikes?

Listed below are one of these type of players for each American League team, those guys facing a make-or-break season with their current organization given their age and experience -- and the kind of players who can help make a season for a team if they come up big.

AL East

Baltimore Orioles -- Dylan Bundy, RHP

At one point, Bundy was regarded as the best pitching prospect in the game. Drafted fourth overall in 2011, Bundy made his professional debut in 2012 and rocketed through the minors, even making two relief appearances for the Orioles that September when he was still just 19. He signed a major league contract out of high school, however, so despite missing most of the past three seasons with injuries, Bundy is now out of options. He'll have to make the Orioles out of spring training, clear waivers (which won't happen) or be traded if the Orioles don't keep him on the 25-man roster.

Boston Red Sox -- Joe Kelly, RHP

Kelly throws a mid-90s sinking fastball but lacks the command and secondary pitches to succeed as a starter -- despite which he keeps getting opportunities to start. Some of that is because of a fluky 2.28 ERA he had in 15 starts with the St. Louis Cardinals in 2013, a mark achieved despite a poor 46/34 strikeout-to-walk ratio in 87 innings. The Red Sox actually demoted him to Triple-A Pawtucket midseason last year and he returned to post a 2.28 ERA in his final eight starts, giving him another chance in the rotation. I think his future is in the bullpen and the Red Sox have several options for the rotation, but you never know.

New York Yankees -- Starlin Castro, 2B

Castro is signed through 2019 and he'll turn 26 in a couple of weeks, but that doesn't mean the Yankees have to make a long-term commitment to him as their second baseman. He had a poor 2013 with the Cubs (-0.4 WAR) and a poor 2015 (0.6 WAR), so another bad season at the plate means three bad seasons out of four and probably a permanent sign that he's no longer the player who hit .300 his first two seasons in the majors.

Tampa Bay Rays -- Desmond Jennings, OF

Once viewed as a foundation piece for the Rays, Jennings played just 28 games in 2015 due to a knee injury and Gold Glover Kevin Kiermaier has now bumped him out of center field. He's also starting to get more expensive and his bat doesn't look as good in a corner outfield position. Could be trade bait if the Rays fall out of the race.

Toronto Blue Jays -- Drew Hutchison, RHP

Hutchison was rushed to the majors in 2012 as a 21-year-old and then missed the 2013 season after having Tommy John surgery. He made a strong return in 2014, making 30 starts, but regressed last season, ranking 88th in ERA among 89 pitchers who pitched at least 150 innings. He ranked 88th in batting average allowed and 86th in slugging percentage as right-handed batters hit .330/.384/.522 against him. He enters spring training battling Jesse Chavez and Aaron Sanchez for the No. 5 starter slot. Sanchez is best suited for the pen and Hutchison has more upside than Chavez.

AL Central

Chicago White Sox -- Avisail Garcia, RF

Scouts always liked Garcia, but I never saw much of a prospect: He never walked in the minors, didn't hit for enough power and wasn't a plus fielder. He may look like Miguel Cabrera at the plate, but he sure doesn't hit like him. The Austin Jackson signing may have sealed his fate as he's likely relegated to a backup role or part-time DH duties.

Cleveland Indians -- Trevor Bauer, RHP

Bauer will have a long major league career but he needs a breakout season if he's going to reach the star status projected when the Arizona Diamondbacks drafted him third overall out of UCLA in 2011. Bauer led the AL with 79 walks while also serving up 23 home runs; you can't do both of those things and come away unscathed and he didn't, registering a 4.55 ERA. The odd thing is he actually throws a high rate of strikes on the first pitch of plate appearances -- 21st out of 124 pitchers with at least 20 starts -- but when he fell behind 1-0 he ended up with more walks (53) than strikeouts (52). I'm not sure if he nibbles too much or doesn't trust his stuff when he falls behind or what, but there's ability here to improve.

Detroit Tigers -- Nick Castellanos, 3B

He improved his defense from ""awful"" to ""we can live with it"" and while I think his upside at the plate is ultimately limited by poor strike-zone judgment (39 walks, 152 strikeouts), he's also just 24 and scouts have always loved his swing. Certainly some breakout potential here.

Kansas City Royals -- Danny Duffy, LHP

He's a lefty with a plus fastball (averaged 93.6 mph in 2015) and a good slider and he had that 2.53 ERA in 2014 (thank you, BABIP), but he's yet to pitch 150 innings in the majors. He's not even guaranteed a rotation slot with Chris Young and Kris Medlen in the mix for the fourth and fifth spots. Duffy is one of those guys who seems likely to have a monster season at some point in his career, but he'll always fight injuries and inconsistency.

Minnesota Twins -- Alex Meyer, RHP

Meyer is different than these other guys because he has just two major league appearances, but we've also been reading about him for years, ever since the Washington Nationals selected him in the first round in 2011 and then traded him for Denard Span. He was moved to the bullpen in Triple-A last year after posting a 7.09 ERA in eight starts and had a 3.74 ERA in 55 relief innings. He still throws 95-plus and the Twins could use a power arm in their pen.

AL West

Jon Singleton batted .191 in 19 games for the Astros last season. AP Photo/Alex Brandon

Houston Astros -- Jon Singleton, 1B

Singleton is one of four guys in the first-base picture for the Astros, along with A.J. Reed, Matt Duffy and Tyler White. Singleton hit .254/.359/.505 with 22 home runs in 102 games at Triple-A Fresno, but that terrible stint in the majors in 2014 (.168 average in 95 games) looms in the background. With Reed on the way -- if not by Opening Day, then likely at some point during the season -- and Duffy and White decent enough stopgaps, you wonder if Singleton's next chance will come somewhere else.

Los Angeles Angels -- C.J. Cron, 1B/DH

Cron will share first base and DH with Albert Pujols and could hit 25 home runs playing every day. But that power comes with a mixed blessing: He never walks, so even though he hit .262 he posted a poor .300 OBP. His strikeout rate actually isn't excessive for a power hitter and he'll hit to the opposite field, so he needs to either (a) improve his batting average, or (b) learn a little patience. His minor league track record suggests the aggressive approach isn't likely to change much.

Oakland Athletics -- Marcus Semien, SS

This is all about Semien's ability to remain at shortstop or whether his future position is second base or a utility position. After making 24 errors the first three months of last season, he trimmed that down to 11 over the final three, including just three in September. The A's believe he can stick at shortstop.

Seattle Mariners -- James Paxton, LHP

A big lefty who throws 94 and owns a four-pitch repertoire, Paxton has tantalized at times the past two seasons, but he made just 26 starts over the past two seasons due to a finger injury in 2015 and a sore shoulder in 2014. He's fighting Nate Karns for the final spot in the Mariners rotation. Like Duffy, there's big upside here if everything comes together but at some point you can't keep counting on a guy if he can't stay healthy.

Texas Rangers -- Jurickson Profar, IF

This is all about playing time. After missing the past two seasons with shoulder problems, the former top overall prospect is healthy again but is blocked by Elvis Andrus at shortstop and Rougned Odor at second base. He needs to play so the Rangers are likely to send him back to Triple-A, but if he proves he's healthy and back to what he was, you wonder if he becomes trade bait if the Rangers need to upgrade their pitching.",[]

espn.com,,Andy Murray already finding it tough to be away from baby daughter,"['Espn Staff', 'Pa Sport', 'Peter Bodo']","After losing in the Australian Open final, Andy Murray gives a speech and thanks his pregnant wife for her support. (0:20)

Andy Murray says he is already finding it difficult to be away from his baby daughter.

Wife Kim gave birth to their first child Sophia on February 7, exactly two weeks after Murray lost to Novak Djokovic in the Australian Open final.

Murray has since taken a month off but has been practising at Wimbledon ahead of his return to the court as Great Britain begin the defence of their Davis Cup title with a first-round tie against Japan in Birmingham this weekend.

He told The Guardian: ""The thing that has surprised me most is how quickly everything changes -- from the first day she was born. You don't notice it when you're there every day but you look back at a photo on the day she was born to one taken five days later to now, a few weeks on, and you see how much things change on a daily basis.

""I really don't want to miss seeing those changes. Even when I'm away for a day I feel bad. I feel I should be there and I want to be there as much as I can. So when I'm leaving the house at eight in the morning and getting back at eight at night, I feel bad.""

Murray became the first person to lose five finals at the same Grand Slam with his straight-sets defeat to Djokovic.

He had admitted before the tournament that he would fly home early if his pregnant wife went into labour, and also had to deal with concerns over his father-in-law Nigel Sears' health after the 58-year-old collapsed in Melbourne while Murray was playing a third-round match.

The Scot paid tribute to Kim after his final defeat, thanking his wife for being ""a legend"" over the previous fortnight, and revealed he is adapting quickly to daddy duties.

""I was OK holding her [Sophia],"" he added. ""The only thing I found difficult was changing her because you see a small person and you think they're so fragile -- or that their hands are so small that when you're putting their fingers through their top that they could maybe break.

""But when you see all the midwives -- and Kim has a good friend who is a midwife -- they're a lot rougher and they do things much more quickly. Lots of people have told me babies are a lot more resilient than you think. They're not going to break.

""After the first couple of days I felt much more confident.""

The last five majors have been won by fathers, four of them claimed by Djokovic and one by Stan Wawrinka. The Serb in particular has played some of his best tennis since becoming a parent in October 2014, winning 15 of 21 tournaments he has entered, including four Grand Slams.

Roger Federer has also enjoyed a resurgence since wife Mirka gave birth to their second set of twins in May 2014, denied an 18th major title by the brilliance of Djokovic in the past two Wimbledon finals, as well as the 2015 US Open final.

But Murray admits it is ""tough to tell"" whether he will experience a baby boom in the Grand Slams.

""I've been training again and certainly haven't been worse,"" said Murray. ""I've been very motivated in practice. Obviously with Novak and Roger it's worked out well. I don't know if having kids has made them play better or if they're just really good.

""For other players it hasn't worked out as well. But [fatherhood] is a positive thing -- and tennis not being your priority can help. It lends perspective when you have a bad loss or bad practice. The outcome of a match is not everything but I want my daughter to be proud of her dad when she grows up and sees what I did. I hope it works out in a positive way on the court but if it doesn't, it's not the end of the world.""

Murray also said he did not need much persuading by Leon Smith to feature for Britain this week against Japan, who will be led by world No.6 Kei Nishikori.

""I always wanted to play providing everything went well with Kim and the baby,"" he said. ""It's going to be a tough tie. Last year the toughest team we played was France and they didn't have anyone ranked as high as Nishikori. He's capable of winning two singles.

""I lost to him once at the World Tour finals in 2014. We've played six times so I've won five. But he's one of the best players in the world and I won't have played a match for almost five weeks. That's the longest break I've ever had at this stage of the season. There are no guarantees but hopefully I can play well and help the team win.""

Following their Davis Cup triumph, Murray's older brother Jamie has also become a Grand Slam champion with victory in the Australian Open doubles final with new partner Bruno Soares.

The siblings combined to contribute vital doubles rubber wins in the ties against France, Australia and Belgium last year, with Murray admitting his involvement in the doubles against Japan depends on how the singles go on Friday.

""When you haven't played for a long time things hurt a bit more after a match."" he said.",[]
espn.com,,Kei Nishikori not Andy Murray under the most pressure,"['Espn Staff', 'Pa Sport', 'Mark Hodgkinson', 'Peter Bodo']","Under the terms of his contract with a noodle company that sells 'instant ramen' in a cup, Japan's leading player is supposed to be addressed -- whether competing in a Davis Cup tie against Great Britain, or in any other event -- as Nissin Kei Nishikori.

Does that make him the first tennis player to have sold his naming rights? Perhaps, but, more importantly. having been associated with the company since 2008, Nishikori's arrangement is an indication of his commercial ambitions, as well as his stature in the market.

Here is someone held in such high esteem by another of his sponsors -- a manufacturer of sanitaryware -- that it presented him with a golden toilet.

For all the expectations and pressures on Andy Murray, whom Nishikori is set to meet in the Davis Cup in Birmingham this week, they don't quite compare to the hopes, dreams and money invested in Japan's leading man.

The burden on him comes with the territory of being the only Asian man to compete in a Grand Slam singles final, as well as the first player to be ranked in the Top 10.

The 2014 US Open finalist has such an extensive portfolio of sponsors that he is earning a level of off-court money to almost rival the gilded members of the Big Four, with some estimates putting his deals at around 14.4 million a year ($20m). At least a dozen companies have a claim on Nishikori's time, with the 26-year-old expected to be one of the faces of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.

On their most recent list of the most marketable athletes in the world, Sports Pro magazine put Nishikori in eighth position, with the publication also noting recently that his contract extension with clothing supplier Uniqlo will be worth around 36m ($50m) over a number of years; his annual fee is reported to be higher than that being paid to Novak Djokovic.

Murray v Nishikori - Financial head-to-head Despite outstripping Nishikori in career earnings and prize money last season, Murray is only slightly ahead in terms of endorsements. Andy Murray Kei Nishikori Career prize money $43.6m (31.4m) $11.7m (8.5m) 2015 prize money $8.7m (6.3m) $3.3m (2.4m) 2015 endorsements* $16m (11.5m) $15m (10.8m) *Forbes' World's Highest-Paid Athletes list, 2014-2015

""Kei's commercial success has to do with a variety of factors. The fact that there had never previously been a Japanese male tennis player in the Top 10 has made an incredible impact on Kei's business platform,"" Nishikori's manager, Olivier van Lindonk, told ESPN.

""Other additional factors are that he is part of an exciting new generation of players, plus he is one of Asia's biggest athletes, the Tokyo 2020 Olympics are around the corner, and he has an enormous fan and media following.""

By only scheduling his commercial activity for certain times of the year, Nishikori avoids distraction. ""Kei's focus is, and always will be, his tennis first,"" Van Lindonk said. ""We set aside three blocks a year, which are each four or five days long, in which Kei takes care of all his shoots and commercial responsibilities.

""We plan this very carefully -- sometimes up to a year in advance -- so that it never interferes with his tournament or training schedule.""

Such is the hysteria when Nishikori returns to Japan that the tournament director of the Tokyo Open won't publicise Nishikori's practice times for fear of causing a crush at the courts. As Nishikori has said, it can be ""crazy"" on those trips.

""For the most part, I just tell Kei that dealing with this pressure is part of the territory for being one of the best in the world,"" Nishikori's coach, the former French Open champion Michael Chang, told ESPN. ""You need to find a balance but at the same time, you also need to keep things in proper perspective.

""How important is what everyone else says? And more importantly, how much pressure do I put on myself? And is that realistic or the right thing to do?""

Chang described Nishikori as being ""on the shy, quiet side -- although he does become quite talkative around his Japanese friends"".

One way that Nishikori protects himself is by living in the United States, in Florida, rather than in Japan. ""If I stayed in Japan, I think I would go crazy,"" he has said. ""By living in the US, I can concentrate on my tennis and I can practise and play all day, and that's something you have to do.

""If I stayed in Japan, there are lots of things that I couldn't do. You have to keep on training hard and don't allow yourself to be distracted, and to remind yourself that you're working hard because you're chasing a dream.""

Another approach is to constantly remind himself why he is competing. ""You have to remember that you're playing for yourself and not for anyone else; that will help you to deal with the pressure from the public.""

Since that deep run at the 2014 US Open, where he was the runner-up to Croatia's Marin Cilic, Nishikori hasn't featured in another Grand Slam final.

After making the quarterfinals of last season's Australian Open and Roland Garros, he was beaten in the second round of Wimbledon and then didn't win a match on his return to Flushing Meadows.

This year's Australian Open saw him make the quarterfinals. But don't imagine that Nishikori, once ranked as high as fourth in the world, is no longer a force at the top of the game.

At 5-foot-10, Nishikori isn't as physically imposing as many others on the Tour, but he has made his speed around the court a weapon, and he has also considerable belief in his game, helped by the encouragement of his coach Chang, who was just 17 years old when he won the 1989 French Open.

In Nishikori's mind, his fame has grown and grown in recent years. But it's still possible for him to become an even bigger figure. Winning a Grand Slam would launch him even further into the stratosphere.

""There are many things that Kei still needs to improve upon, but one aspect that could really help him win a slam would be his serve. It's improved a lot over the past couple of years but it still needs to get better and more consistent,"" Chang said. ""Kei has gained a great deal of confidence from the 2014 US Open.

""Overall though, he is no longer surprised by winning tournaments or playing well in them anymore. I tell him that this should be his attitude as he is one of the best players in the world.""",[]

Most of the game's greats come highly pedigreed. They're either drafted in the early stages of the MLB draft, or signed for big money as international amateurs or professionals. There are, arguably more so than in the other sports, plenty of outliers, late draft picks or late-blooming international players who grow into major contributors. Then there are the outliers even among the outliers, such as Arizona Diamondbacks outfielder David Peralta.

Peralta's professional journey began as one of those lower-end international signees a full decade ago, when he was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals -- as a pitcher. He topped out in the rookie-level Appalachian League, toiling for two seasons with the club's Johnson City affiliate at ages 18-19. He did strike out just more than a batter per inning over that span, but was otherwise ineffective, posting ERAs in the fives. He then required shoulder surgery, and was eventually released.

Most pro careers would have ended right there, but not this guy's. After rehabbing his shoulder, Peralta embarked on a career as a position player, taking the longest road imaginable, via the independent leagues. He started at the absolute bottom rung, rolling out a .392/.429/.661 line in 2011 in the North American League, which doesn't even exist anymore, at age 23. Such a performance at that age in such a low-end league guarantees a player little more than a similar job for the next season, maybe in a better league, and possibly invitations from a few MLB clubs to winter free-agent workouts.

Peralta was back at it in 2012, batting .332/.392/.462 for Wichita in the American Association, a slightly more established independent circuit. Still nothing. By this time, however, he had caught the eye of D-backs' independent league scout Chris Carminucci. My many duties as an MLB scout and executive during my time in the game included independent league scouting oversight for both the Brewers and Mariners, and I was familiar with Carminucci from his indie-league managing days. He was about to catch his big fish.",[]

Just as it did for sister Serena in 2015, Venus' return is resonating among many influential tennis figures in tennis.

Here's what they had to say:

Chris Evert, ESPN analyst and 18-time Grand Slam winner: ""It was a horrible experience for both Venus and Serena, and both are forgiving of the treatment they received. They have both grown up and evolved into compassionate women and have moved forward. They want to leave no stone unturned before they retire.""

Zina Garrison, 1990 Wimbledon runner-up: ""When you see what's happening in the world right now, it's great to see athletes who have gone through adversity, and who are able to forgive and to overcome those things. It's good for young people to see that, as it gives you hope.

""I think that Venus experienced this in a very different way to how Serena experienced it. Venus was right in the midst of [the crowd]. Venus and Serena are different people, too, and they have come to this in different ways. Venus came to grips with everything in her own time, and she's coming back at the time that's best for her.

""All those experiences that she's been though, she's grown because of them, and this is the perfect time for Venus to come back. This will be great for her. It's a big thing for the tournament to have both of the sisters playing again. It definitely adds something to the tournament. There will be emotions when Venus plays, definitely emotions. But what she has been though in her life -- her illness, and the tragedy in her family -- this is something else she can overcome.""

Nick Bollettieri, hall-of-fame tennis coach: ""No matter where they go, successful people, including athletes, create interest and participation. When Tiger Woods was in his prime, golf attendance and TV viewership was at an all-time high. Tennis events are no different. You need the stars and the best players to draw the attendance and create the excitement.

""Having both Venus and Serena playing again at Indian Wells this year will create a buzz and additional interest in this great event. Venus is playing very well. I'm sure she will have some inner thoughts, and who doesn't? But I know she will perform, as she always has, with grace and a fierce competitive spirit.""

Paul Annacone, former coach of Pete Sampras and Roger Federer: ""Clearly, it's always great for any event to have both Venus and Serena in their field. For Indian Wells to have them both back after so many years just magnifies the impact. They are legends, and we don't know how long they will play so wherever they play makes it more valuable and precious. I can only guess how Venus is going to feel when she's back on court, but I would think there will be a few nerves and maybe apprehension.

""But after seeing Serena's warm reception from last year, I think the focus will quickly turn to competing and playing her best tennis, and executing her strategy. She's seen so many different types of environments, and those experiences can only help.""

Pam Shriver, ESPN analyst and 21-time doubles Grand Slam winner: ""After 15 years, having both Venus and Serena back at Indian Wells will signal even more healing and forgiveness. Moving on is important for everyone, and it was hard to 100 percent move on from 15 years ago without Venus playing Indian Wells again, too.

""Venus has been more private about her reasons for not playing and she is not as emotional as Serena, so while I would expect some emotion from Venus, compared to Serena, it will be much more understated. I am not surprised, though, that she is coming back, and I think she would have come back sooner but did not want to hurt her sister or dad and play before they were ready to have a Williams back in the field.""",[]

(3:05)

SARASOTA, Fla. -- Top Boston Red Sox prospect Michael Kopech is in trouble once again.

Kopech, a right-handed pitcher and 2014 first-round draft pick, suffered a small fracture of his right hand during what the team described as an ""altercation"" with his roommate a few days ago, Red Sox general manager Mike Hazen said Tuesday. The incident comes six months after Kopech finished serving a 50-game suspension for violating the minor-league drug policy.

""It's disappointing, very disappointing. It was stupid,"" Hazen said. ""He's going to have to grow up, obviously, with the things that have happened so far.""

Hazen declined to get into specifics or divulge the name of Kopech's roommate in Boston's minor league camp. He also didn't say whether the team intends to discipline Kopech.

It's unclear how much time the 19-year-old will miss, according to Hazen, who said the Sox are still trying to determine the severity of the fracture and whether it will require surgery.

Kopech, who was drafted out of Mount Pleasant High School in Texas, posted a 2.63 ERA in 65 innings last season for Single-A Greenville before testing positive for Oxilofrine, a stimulant drug and an amphetamine that is typically an ingredient in some dietary supplements.

""He's got a long road to go to get to the big leagues,"" Hazen said of Kopech. ""He obviously has a ton of potential, and he's got a long way to go. These types of things, you don't want to put more barriers in front of you than playing professional baseball already presents.""

The Red Sox haven't developed a homegrown starting pitcher with staying power in the rotation since Clay Buchholz made his big league debut in 2007. Kopech and 18-year-old Anderson Espinoza represent the top pitching prospects in the organization.",[]

After the dust settled, the final eight players were: Joe ""LI Joe"" Ciaramelli, Julio ""Julio"" Fuentes, ""TA|Moons,"" Arturo ""TS|Sabin"" Sanchez, Emmanuel ""TSC|CD Mani"" Brito, Ryan ""PG|FilipinoChamp"" Ramirez, ""3K,"" and Brentt ""r/SF|Brenttiscool"" Franks.

Julio ""Julio"" Fuentes looked for his match in the bracket. He was very confident. His only worry for the rest of the tournament? TS|Sabin and his Dhalsim. It presented a tough matchup, but he could always surprise him in a tournament set.

He scanned his next match in top-8: TS|Sabin.

LI Joe took a deep breath.

""Make sure you adapt and don't get stubborn in your play,"" he whispered to himself.

He was going to face up against one of the best United States' players, PG|FilipinoChamp and his Dhalsim. He popped a small candy into his mouth and chewed slowly. The sugar rush kept his eyes focused and his mindset clear. Just stay calm and focus on the match. He sat down and took a long drink from his water bottle. One more check on his buttons and a deep breath before his opponent selected the stage.

FilipinoChamp plays so different from Sabin. As he thought and adapted to the match, he threw out a moonsault and clutched out the first round. The second round began and it was another chase. One missed opportunity and FilipinoChamp took full advantage to even the round score. A restless crowd watched the stage with chants of ""Joe!""

""Dude, Joe is scaring Champ right now,"" Victor ""Spooky"" Fontanez commentated on the stream. Ciaramelli took advantage of the space given and threw Dhalsim four consecutive times before ending the round with a fake-out. The crowd erupted in cheers.

""The mix-ups are too real for Champ right now,"" Fontanez continued as the next game began in Ciaramelli's favor.

With one confirm into critical art, the match was over. Ciaramelli stood up from his seat immediately and dashed over to the other side of the stage in jubilation. As a crowd of players embraced him, he broke off and hugged his training buddy, TA|Moons.

Fuentes took the stage, his fight stick in hand, and sat down first. His eyes concentrated on the screen as he tested out his buttons before TS|Sabin took his seat next to him. A brief handshake and smile and his eyes reconnected to the screen.

The round began and Fuentes immediately entered into the space of his opponent's Dhalsim. Never let him breathe and punish everything he does, He thought. Never let him have a chance to escape. He went over the checklist of steps in every round -- if he went to the air, check him with a step kick, whiff punish far pokes, and suffocate him when up-close.

""Wow, it's over. Julio, please!"" Fontanez commentated. ""He played that match like he was ready to be a Dhalsim demon.""

The match was over and Fuentes took off his headset, unable to hide his beaming smile. This was the best run in a major tournament for him and he needed to keep everything in check. He belonged in the top-8. All the hard work and how much time he put into the game was paying off.

Take a step back, Fuentes thought. Just stay cool and confident and don't get too far ahead. I just have to take every match as they come and think it out when I fight.

The stage was set between the east coast's best hope in Ciaramelli and the upstart young fighter from the west coast, Fuentes. It was winner's finals and the winner would advance to the grand finals of the entire tournament with the victor's advantage.

Fuentes took his seat first and practiced his attacks and combos while Ciaramelli took his time to unwrap his fight stick before finally taking a seat. The crowd was firmly behind Ciaramelli as he closed his eyes, his head tilted down, and took a long breath before whispering, ""Ok.""

Fuentes struck first. He was relentless in his pressure, pinning his opponent against the corner and punished every wrong decision. Ciaramelli fought back with his keep-away game and pushed every correct button. The last round of the first game was a slugfest. Both exchanged attacks until both were on pixels. Ciaramelli stuck out a low medium kick and won the game.

Ciaramelli took a long swig of his water bottle before lowering his ear to his friend for advice. Fuentes pushed his headphones off his ear as he discussed the match with the support from his temporary coach.

Fuentes recognized that Ciaramelli made his favorite button, fierce punch, whiff and understood that all his resources should be expended to get close. After that, things should go his way.

The mental break worked out for Fuentes as every scramble fell in his favor and he capitalized on every hit for an extended combination attack, regardless of how difficult or small the window.

I have never played a Ken that good before, Ciaramelli thought after the match ended. He took his time to pack everything and slowly walked off the stage. His head a little lower than before as he racked his mind on how he lost after starting off so well.

Joe ""LI Joe"" Ciaramelli (left) and Julio ""Julio"" Fuentes (right) Eric Stewart

Ciaramelli watched the tournament from the side of the venue as he continued to poke and prod at the match that eluded him. ""I can make the necessary adjustments,"" Ciaramelli kept telling himself.

""How should I approach Ken?"" Ciaramelli asked his friends in the crowd. Together, they figured out. He was punishing many whiff throws, so throw later and watch for the bait. He jumped in on me too many times, sharpen up the anti-airs. And lastly, use the fastest normal in the arsenal to check both the unfamiliar run and kick target combo.

Fuentes thought 'I've been on stage and lost before, that feeling is familiar.' All the work is paying off, I just got to stay confident and positive. I can actually win this tournament. He paced himself and kept calm before the last match of the tournament was called.

The grand finals

Fuentes and Ciaramelli were in the grand finals of Winter Brawl X. Ciaramelli climbed back into the picture after he eliminated his training partner and friend, TA|Moons. That match was one where either party could have emerged as the victor, but Ciaramelli wanted the rematch just that much more.

Ciaramelli started out on-fire. Every fireball kept Fuentes out and he deliberately anti-aired two jump-ins. Then, the first hit of the target combination that he game planned for occurred and Ciaramelli slammed his jab button for the punish. Advantage Ciaramelli. The second round ended in similar fashion, except Ciaramelli got his own baits working. One confirm into a critical art and the crowd reacted with chants of 'Joe' and claps.

Every mix-up hit, all his projectiles were well-spaced, and his escape options were brilliant. Ciaramelli was challenging everything and establishing as much space as possible.

""He's mauling him,"" TS|Sabin commentated on the stream.

A quick game two and Ciaramelli smiled at the result. He took another long drink from his water bottle and nodded his head before the set resumed. The third game started slowly and Ciaramelli built his lead before finally sealing the first round with a whiff-punish into a critical art.

""What a turnaround,"" Sanchez said. ""Joe is sticking and running -- he's doing a good job of staying out of Ken's plus-frames and pokes.""

Adjustment completed. Ciaramelli swept Fuentes and reset the bracket for a final best-of-three set for the tournament. With the win, he left his seat and immediately went to the other side of the stage to take in all the cheers and advice that his peers gave him. Once he took his seat, his eyes narrowed in. It was time to finish business.

The first round was back-and-forth as both combatants exchanged pressure in the corner. However, it was Ciaramelli who conditioned his opponent to always go for a throw as he punished him with combination attack after attack. One more critical art and it was four games in a row. Fuentes was shaken.

But, he would fight back. Behind fantastic hit-confirms and safe pressure, he took advantage of his mobility and superior damage to even the set. A big breath from Fuentes before the game rematch. He didn't need more than 15 seconds to think about the game. Another big lead and another clutch critical art to finish off the next game's opening round for Ciaramelli and Fuentes was on the backburner again. Now, the spacing was in Ciaramelli's favor and jump-ins were a factor. Fuentes' mistimed attacks and allowed for Ciaramelli to pile on too much damage.

""One more game, one more game!"" the crowd chanted as Ciaramelli took a 2-1 lead in the finals.

The last game was more of the same as Ciaramelli crushed every opportunity Fuentes wanted for space and ended the set with another critical art. Ciaramelli stood up and immediately was swamped by the crowd as Fuentes closed his eyes and put his head into his hands.

What happened? Fuentes thought. He wasn't afraid to show his disappointment as he lingered in his seat. Fuentes smiled after and acknowledged how far we went. You made it this far, he just beat you.

Winter Brawl X was a great example of how the young up-and-comers are legitimate and, the older players can still be real threats.

""I have a very strong drive to be a top player in this game. I may not be the best but I want to remain a threat to the Street Fighter world,"" Ciaramelli told me. ""I don't get too bored when playing at a high-level, it's actually pretty exciting, which helps fuel the drive. The amount of support I've received so far has been unbelievable. I hope I can make everyone proud and give others some inspiration. It's not what I play for, it's who I play for, that matters.""

As for Fuentes, he's just getting started as well. A second-place finish as his best placement in a major tournament is hardly a weak result.

""It's surreal now since I can remember just playing in the arcades as a 16-year old,"" Fuentes said. ""It's really motivated me. I'm getting somewhere.""",[]
espn.com,,"Brock Osweiler instantly upgrades Houston Texans, but he'll need help",['Tania Ganguli'],"HOUSTON -- There is no sport where it's harder to identify the impact of an individual than in football.

Football results from choreography, and that's why free agency tends not to have as big an impact in this sport than in many others. In fact, the biggest spenders in free agency often don't improve unless they sign one of the greatest quarterbacks ever, as the Denver Broncos did four years ago.

The Houston Texans added an instant upgrade on Wednesday by snagging former Broncos quarterback Brock Osweiler, a move that can't be made official until 4 p.m. ET Wednesday when the new league year begins. But he'll need help.

He comes to a team that had holes everywhere on offense. That's not an exaggeration.

The Texans have needs on their offensive line -- especially with the departure of center Ben Jones in free agency. They also lost Brandon Brooks, whom they've replaced with former Chiefs guard Jeff Allen. They need a receiver to complement DeAndre Hopkins so that when Hopkins draws double-teams it doesn't hamstring their quarterback. They needed a running back, having moved on from Arian Foster, and are addressing that with the speedy Lamar Miller. Miller will be 25 this season and can offer three productive years.

They need upgrades at tight end after a season in which they had the second-worst completion percentage to tight ends in the entire NFL. That followed a season in which the Texans targeted tight ends fewer times than any other team in the league. And they need a left tackle to eventually take over for Duane Brown.

If you're keeping score at home, heading into free agency, that accounted for a need at every position. For the Osweiler era to truly work, the Texans need their newcomers to pan out and to continue to fill the holes that remain.

They've spent a lot here in free agency to address some of what ailed their offense last season. The Texans ranked 31st in yards per play in 2015. The draft also offers options at running back, tight end and receiver. It's also a very deep class for offensive linemen, especially tackles. Adding Osweiler also doesn't preclude the Texans from drafting another quarterback.

Adding Osweiler is a step in the right direction. He'll help the Texans, but they have to help him, too.",[]

espn.com,2016-03-09 06:23:44+00:00,Marco Rubio Never Had A Base,['Nate Silver'],"Except in the improbable event that he comes back to win the Republican nomination, Marco Rubio is likely to become a political idiom. As Mike Huckabee is synonymous with a candidate who wins Iowa on the basis of evangelical support but cant expand beyond that, or Fred Thompson is a stand-in for a candidate who launches his campaign too late, a Rubioesque candidate will be one who is everyones second choice.

For a long time, polls have shown Rubio as perhaps the most broadly acceptable candidate within the Republican field, with high favorability ratings and competitive performances in hypothetical one-on-one matchups against Donald Trump. But Rubio has just about 20 percent of the Republican vote so far and has won only Minnesota and Puerto Rico. Hawaii results are still pending as I write this, but he did terribly everywhere else on Tuesday and will probably fail to receive any delegates from Michigan, Mississippi or Idaho.

Data like this can produce cognitive dissonance. At times during the campaign, Rubio perpetually seemed to be either overrated or underrated, depending on who was doing the rating. But theres nothing inherently contradictory about it. If Trump is the candidate with a high floor of support but perhaps a relatively low ceiling, Rubio is the opposite, with a lot of potential supporters but a low floor  he doesnt have much of a base.

Increasingly, that potential looks as though it will go unrealized. But I want to back up and consider why Rubio is in this predicament. I wont focus on recent strategic decisions made by his campaign, such as his potty humor directed at Trump, insofar as these decisions are more the effect of his problems (when youre losing, its rational to employ high-risk strategies) than the cause of them. Instead, I see three main issues for Rubio that have dated back to the start of his campaign:

Problem No. 1: Rubio hasnt built up a lot of voter loyalty.

Its not my job to judge the candidates credentials, but I sympathize with Republicans who think Rubios are a little light. As a first-term senator at a time of political gridlock, he hasnt gotten much legislation passed: According to the Thomas database, the only bill to have become law of which Rubio was the main sponsor is the Girls Count Act of 2015. His most high-profile legislative effort, on immigration reform, ended in failure. Rubio did have some accomplishments as speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, although he hasnt talked about them much on the campaign trail. Perhaps thats because Rubio is wary of drawing comparisons to Barack Obama, who, likewise, was a first-term U.S. senator and a former state legislator when he sought the presidency.

But Rubio didnt replicate Obamas success in one important way. Whereas Obama built a gigantic ground operation from the earliest stages of his campaign, Rubio failed to develop much of one. That contributes toward a low floor. If youre not contacting voters personally, they arent all that invested in you, and although they may come your way from time to time, they also may abandon you at the first sign of trouble.

Also unlike Obama, Rubio didnt receive all that much media exposure. Instead, like every other Republican candidate, he was overshadowed by Trump, who got nine times as much coverage on network news as Rubio did in 2015. Without that vetting having taken place earlier in the campaign, Republicans are learning a lot about Rubio as theyre already in the midst of voting, contributing to the volatility in his political standing.

Problem No. 2: Trying to be everything to everyone isnt easy.

You may remember our old friend the Republican five-ring circus diagram, which depicts the overlapping constituencies that the Republican candidates seek to win votes from. From the start, weve put Rubio in the establishment circle, thinking hes too far removed from his days as a tea-party-backed candidate to still qualify as one.

The establishment circle is a special place, however. Its not that there are literally all that many establishment voters (except, maybe, in the northern Virginia suburbs, where Rubio performed well). Instead, the more successful establishment candidates seek to be consensus candidates, keeping the peace with some or all party factions. Consider Mitt Romney, who was elected governor in Massachusetts as a pragmatic moderate, then ran as a movement conservative in the Republican race of 2008 and then was somewhere in between those things when he was nominated in 2012. Or Obama, who in 2008 ran as a post-partisan candidate to some Democratic voters and as a progressive hero to others.

Such candidates can be accused of shape-shifting or flip-flopping, but they often capture their partys nomination. Such a strategy requires a lot of political dexterity, however. Not only do you have to stay on message, you have to sustain multiple messages to multiple audiences. (Trump, although hardly a consensus candidate, has some of this ability.) It helps to have surrogates vouching for you to different constituencies, something Rubio didnt have a lot of until recently. And it helps to have enough media exposure to avoid being typecast in one role, something Rubio hasnt had all that much of in Trumps shadow.

Problem No. 3: Rubios cosmopolitan image is an odd match for his conservative politics.

The Republican race is tricky to map demographically, especially in comparison to the Democratic one. Trumps best congressional districts so far, according to data that my colleague Aaron Bycoffe and I have collected, include such diverse places as NV-1 (Las Vegas), AL-4 (rural northwest Alabama) and MA-9 (far eastern Massachusetts, including Cape Cod).

Rubios best districts have a bit more in common. Here are the five congressional districts where he received the largest share of the vote through Super Tuesday:

TX-33: A highly Democratic district covering parts of Dallas and its suburbs.

MN-5: A highly Democratic district covering parts of Minneapolis and its suburbs.

GA-5: An extremely Democratic district covering parts of Atlanta and its suburbs.

MN-4: A highly Democratic district covering parts of St. Paul, Minnesota, and its suburbs.

VA-8: A highly Democratic district in northern Virginia, covering the Washington suburbs.

Now, if Rubio were a moderate or liberal Republican (or a conservative running in moderate garb, like John Kasich), this is pretty much what youd expect to see. But he isnt: Rubios voting record and issue positions are quite conservative, and hes run as a conservative. Furthermore, although this has varied some from state to state, exit polls havent shown Rubio doing especially well with moderate voters; in South Carolina, for example, he won 23 percent of the vote from moderate Republicans, about the same as his share of the vote overall. It may be that Rubios most reliable voters are conservatives who live among liberals, a difficult group to build a base from.

The other thing we can tell about Rubios supporters is that they have high socioeconomic status, especially as measured by education. So do Kasichs  whereas by contrast, Ted Cruzs and especially Trumps have lower incomes and education levels. Roughly speaking, you can plot the Republican candidates on a two-by-two grid that looks like this:

That chart is a simplification, of course, most notably because it implies that the four quadrants are equally sized when they probably arent. Trump, in particular, is proving that theres a fairly large market for populism among Republicans and independents who vote in Republican primaries, especially those with lower socioeconomic status. Trumps voters average out to being fairly moderate, although they arent conventionally so: From what we can tell, for instance, his voters dont care very much about abortion or gay marriage, although they do care about immigration.

Rubio, by contrast, may be proving that theres not all that large a market for what you might call an upscale or cosmopolitan conservative. Many voters in the near-in suburbs, Rubios best areas geographically, long ago left the Republican Party. Rubio might have the image to win them back  young, Hispanic, optimistic  but he doesnt have the policies, being staunchly conservative on issues such as abortion and gay marriage. Likewise, while Rubio appears to do well among nonwhite Republicans, there are very few of them voting in the primaries, and Rubio has turned away from the moderate immigration positions that once might have won him more Latino support.

Rubio is also somewhat boxed in by Cruz and, to a perhaps underappreciated extent, Kasich. If Cruz werent in the race, there would be a scramble between Rubio and Trump for voters in the bottom-right corner of the chart, who have lower socioeconomic status but are highly conservative (and often very religious). Rubio might win it: He could position himself as the only true conservative in the race, and polls suggest that more Cruz supporters have Rubio as their second choice than Trump. If Kasich were out of the race, meanwhile, Rubio could pivot more toward the center  at an opportune time, given that the calendar is turning to blue and purple states. But with Cruz and Kasich still running  and in fact, seeming to gain ground in recent days  Rubio is back to where he started, as a lot of voters second choice.",[]

Duke: Demolishes lane opponent to secure IEM World Championship

Name: Lee ""Duke"" Ho-Seong

Team: SK Telecom T1

Update: Duke played an impressive series, utilizing terrifying tanks to earn a 19/5/16 KDA in three games.

Analysis: Duke demonstrated his expertise in the top lane against Gamsu in the three game sweep over Fnatic. In Game One of the series, he fell behind due to a lane swap into freeze set up by his opponents, but was able to roam quickly to pick up several kills for himself and his team. He was able to translate this kill advantage to a terrifying presence in team fights to come back from the small disadvantage they had. In Game Two, Duke played the lane even better than he had in the previous game, earning a 7/3/7 KDA and absolutely dominating his lane opponent. Once again, as soon as he was able to gain a lead he ran with it, assisting in strangling his opponents out of the game. Despite the game lasting a near 40 minutes, Duke was able to retain his low death count while continuously diving into the enemy to peel for his carries and force Rekkles out of the fight. His play was instrumental in the success of SKT in the second game. Moving into Game Three, Duke put on yet another beefy front liner. Opting for Nautilus, he fell behind in farm against Graves, as expected. Once again, he was able to mitigate the disadvantage through roaming and creating picks and fights in his teams favor. This game ended up being the most impressive, as he picked up a whopping six kills while on a tank and absolutely closing any opportunity for the enemy to comeback forcing them to surrender in 22 minutes. This secured SKT's title of IEM Katowice 2016 Champions.

Faker: Challenged in IEM Final but able to prevail

Name: Lee ""Faker"" Sang-hyeok

Team: SK Telecom T1

Update: Faker had an exceptional performance in the IEM Grand Finals to claim the 2016 Championship and sweep Fnatic in the finals.

Analysis: Faker started off the series rocky, getting solo killed by his lane opponent Febiven. After this, he played more conservatively and to Corki's strengths, dealing massive damage and poking along with Ezreal to deter Fnatic from taking objectives or picking fights. Falling behind early, the scaling potential of his team comp kept Faker from making any attempted hero plays and the team was able to take several favorable team fights to swing the score back in their favor and close out the first game of the series. Faker brought out an extremely unexpected Vel'Koz in Game Two and used it to great success. Despite a 40 minute game, he died only twice, while dealing insane amounts of damage. His positioning in team fights was immaculate, keeping himself safe from the dive of Lee Sin, Nautilus, and Lissandra. His crucial ultimates and use of his zoning abilities landed him the victory in Game Two placing his team in a good spot to claim the Championship Title. Game Three saw one of Faker's best performance of the series. Being placed on his well known Zed, he was able to quickly navigate the map and dominate all lanes making it impossible for Fnatic to do anything. By 22 minutes, he had choked out all the lanes to the point that Fnatic was down over 10,000 gold and forcing them to surrender, earning himself the IEM Championship trophy.

Bang: Near flawless performance against Fnatic in IEM Grand Finals

Name: Bae ""Bang"" Jun-sik

Team: SK Telecom T1

Update: Bang played an exceptional series to sweep Fnatic in the IEM Finals, earning a series KDA of 15/3/30.

Analysis: Once again Bang has managed to maintain one of the highest KDA's in competitive League of Legends, earning a 15.0 KDA in the IEM Grand Finals. Game One allowed him to play his signature Ezreal and he played it to great success. He had to gain an early advantage to keep up with Fnatic's late game Kog'maw potential. Unfortunately, the team fell behind early, but Bang was able to maintain his footing and keep himself in the game. Several team fights broke out and his excellent positioning combined with his ability to deal the highest possible damage per second allowed his team to mount a comeback and close out Game One. In Game Two, he had an even more impressive performance on Ezreal, earning a 7/1/15 scoreline and participating in all but two of his team's kills. Once again, his positioning was to envy and he absolutely demolished Fnatic. Unable to catch him, they were forced to allow him to deal massive amounts of damage without any response. His play was especially impressive, given that he only died once in the 40 minute game. Despite this impressive performance, his final game of the series is arguably even more impressive as he remained deathless and forced Fnatic to surrender. He was able to create an early lead for himself with the help of Faker's roams and destroyed Rekkles shot at the IEM title. In just 22 minutes, he would help his team gain a 10,000 gold lead and give Rekkles a 0/4/1 KDA to end the series.

Wolf: Impressive tank play to secure IEM Victory

Name: Lee ""Wolf"" Jae-wan

Team: SK Telecom T1

Update: Wolf played a mixture of Braum and Alistar to engage for his team and make short work of Fnatic, earning himself a series KDA of 2/6/43.

Analysis: Once again, Wolf was able to help secure an SKT victory with his shot calling and leadership. Throughout the series, he was able to set up various engages that lead to favorable fights even when his team was already behind. Adding to his ability to help his team close out the game, his vision control was immaculate, allowing his team to move undetected through the enemy territory throughout the series to obtain vital information and secure contested objectives. By putting himself on champions that can roam, he was able to make plays around the map without putting his team at a disadvantage by leaving his lane. In Game One, although his team fell behind early, he was able to land a clutch Braum ultimate on more than one occasion to start a fight and ensure his team's victory. Game Two put him on Braum, where once again he was able to gain an early lead in lane and transition it to the rest of the map through warding and vision plays. This allowed him to keep his team safe in a 40 minute victory. In the final game of the series he was allowed to get Alistar, his signature champion where he headbutted his way to victory, forcing Fnatic to surrender in just 22 minutes as he dominated the map. This allowed his team to be crowned the IEM Katowice 2016 Champions.

MARCH 6, 2016

Doublelift: Can't hang in lane in sweep by SK Telecom T1

Name: Yiliang ""Doublelift"" Peng

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Doublelift and Team SoloMid got taken apart in team fights throughout the series and he finished with a 2/7/1 KDA.

Analysis: Doublelift wasn't able to be much of a factor in Game One. He tried to stay close during the laning phase but got caught out of position and started to fall behind on his slow scaling champion Ezreal. The rest of the game was dominated by SKT, and they were able to catch Doublelift out of position a few more times before finishing the game. Game Two went slightly better for Doublelift on Kalista, but SKT's team fighting skills were too much for TSM. They lost the game in 25 minutes.

Yell0wStaR: Roughed up in sweep by SK Telecom T1

Name: Bora ""Yell0wStaR"" Kim

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Yellowstar had a problematic series and finished with a 0/8/3 KDA.

Analysis: Game One was almost all SKT, and Yellowstar wasn't able to be of much use for TSM as a front line tank on Alistar. TSM had poor positioning in team fights, and SKT got the better of them in the second half of the game. In Game Two Yellowstar opted to pick Janna, which left TSM without a front line tank. He made Janna's kit work for him somewhat throughout the game as he used his tornados and ultimate to disengage and get away from some fights. However Janna is really squishy, and Yellowstar became the early target for SKT in team fights and finished Game Two with the most deaths for TSM. SKT continued their team fight dominance, and it only took them 25 minutes to best TSM in Game Two.

Hauntzer: Swept by SK Telecom T1

Name: Kevin ""Hauntzer"" Yarnell

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Hauntzer had a poor series and finished with a 2/4/1 KDA.

Analysis: Hauntzer picked Nautilus in Game One and was counter picked -- which led to him losing lane. He roamed from lane and picked up an assist early, but it wasn't enough to make up for his gold deficit against Duke's Trundle. Team fights really didn't go well in Game One, and TSM was destroyed in the second half of the game. Game Two's laning phase went slightly better for Hauntzer, he fell behind on CS but made up for it by picking up first blood on Duke. However the game didn't last long enough for Hauntzer to get fed enough and become the split pushing monster that is late game Fiora. SKT started to group up and dismantle TSM in fights and finished the game in 25 minutes.

Svenskeren: Can't overcome counter jungling in series loss to SK Telecom T1

Name: Dennis ""Svenskeren"" Johnsen

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Svenskeren was constantly bullied in his jungle in series against SK Telecom T1. He finished with a 3/7/4 KDA.

Analysis: Svenskeren had a slow start to Game One, Blank invaded early and stole jungle camps early, which earned him a lead in farm. Most of TSM's lanes fell behind early but Svenskeren helped Bjergsen in mid and got him some kills early. However SKT was too much for TSM in team fights, and they took over the second half of the game. The jungle invasions remained a problem for Svenskeren in Game Two. He was still able to make plays and get his team some kills, but TSM couldn't hang with SKT in team fights, and they lost the game in 25 minutes.

Bjergsen: Rough Game Two during sweep by SK Telecom T1

Name: Soren ""Bjergsen"" Bjerg

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Bjergsen had a strong Game One but didn't impact Game Two and finished with a 3/6/4 KDA in the series.

Analysis:Bjergsen was staying close in the laning phase of Game One; he made good trades with Faker and with the help of his team got the first kills and knocked down the first tower in his lane. However he wasn't fed enough on LeBlanc to carry his team in fights, and SKT dominated the second half of the game. Game Two had a similar start where Bjergsen stayed close in lane and knocked down the first tower in his lane, but once SKT grouped for team fights TSM couldn't stop them. Bjergsen wasn't able to make good use of Twisted Fate's global ultimate. Usually its best use is for teleporting in and cutting off the enemy's escape route or flanking in a fair fight to give his team the numbers advantage, but Bjergsen never had situations to use it that way. Mainly he used the ultimate to try to secure kills for his team but ended up only getting assists. All of Bjergsen's kills came in the first game of the series, and TSM had no chance of winning Game Two without one of their main damage dealers picking up kills and getting fed.

Gamsu: Outclassed in series sweep by SKT

Name: Yeong-Jin ""Gamsu"" Noh

Team: Fnatic

Update: Gamsu was unable to out perform Duke in Fnatic's series loss against SKT, earning himself a series KDA of 5/11/11.

Analysis:Starting out the series in a lane swap, Gamsu was put in an unfavorable position. He was able to set up an expert lane freeze to earn himself a 30 CS advantage by 10 minutes. His early advantage was quickly mitigated as Duke roamed to catch up and create himself a quick advantage of his own. An unfortunate team fight at 30 minutes blew open the game and Gamsu was unable to help his team close out the game. Game Two in the series told a similar story yet one that was not as impressive for Gamsu. After falling behind early as Nautilus, he was unable to make a sufficient impact on any fights and Duke quickly ran away with the lane. Gamsu's positioning was lacking and he was unable to peel for his team or create the necessary picks to open the game up. Hoping that it couldn't get worse, Gamsu was put on Graves in Game Three to hopefully allow himself to create a lane advantage and transition it into a win to bring his team back in the series. Starting the game off strong, he picked up first blood onto his lane opponent with the help of his team diving Duke. Unfortunately, this would be the extent of his success in Fnatic's final game loss against SKT, as he was repeatedly focused while Duke was able to roam using Nautilus' crowd control to great affect picking up kill after kill. The domination would only last 22 minutes as Fnatic surrendered, falling 0-3 to SKT in the IEM Katowice Grand Finals.

Spirit: Unable to kick his way to victory against World Champions

Name: Lee ""Spirit"" Da-yoon

Team: Fnatic

Update: Spirit played three Lee Sin games against SKT but was unable to create the plays necessary to claim the victory in this series sweep, earning himself a KDA of 5/15/12.

Analysis:Spirit had a strong start to the series against SKT, picking up several early kills and assisting his team in fights to create an advantage early on. After creating a rather large lead, 29 minutes into the game showed a change of pace as Fnatic was able to respond to a slow engage. This turned the game around and Spirit was unable to open the game up after. Game Two was a disappointingly uncharacteristic performance from Spirit who seemed to be playing desperately - and his KDA showed it. A high kill game resulted in him finishing the game 0/6/7 with minimal impact as Rekkles tried desperately to carry his team. Blank simply outclassed Spirit in terms of vision control as well as early pressure to land Fnatic their second loss of the series. In Game Three, Spirit opted for Lee Sin once again, and had another poor performance. The early game was blown open quickly by Blank giving Fnatic no time to respond. Spirit tried desperately to create plays, but once again his lanes had fallen behind and the situation was not redeemable, and as Fnatic lost a fight at the 21 minute mark, they opted to surrender.

Febiven: Solo kills Faker - not enough to win the series

Name: Fabian ""Febiven"" Diepstraten

Team: Fnatic

Update: Febiven had an impressive showing his series against SKT. Despite his 7/9/10 KDA, he played well but was unable to clench the victory against the World Champions.

Analysis:Starting off the series, Febiven was determined to show that he is as good of a mid laner as Faker. Giving himself the counterpick, he took Zed into Corki and showed his proficiency on the champion picking up first blood in a solo kill 1-v-1. Unfortunately, Febiven's success in the remainder of the game was limited. After several close fights, SKT was able to turn the game on it's heels and close it out quickly. In Game Two, Febiven turned to a more controlled style of play picking Lissandra. He was met with Faker's Vel'Koz and seemingly unprepared. After assisting his team in picking up first blood he gained a lead for himself in lane against Fkaer and started roaming around the map to help the rest of his team. This allowed Fnatic to pick up an early advantage, but unfortunately Spirit was caught out repeatedly throwing the lead away. Febiven was heavily focused, but able to make an impact with his lock down. After SKT secured a baron, the game was too far gone to redeem and Febiven was unable to make up for his teams positioning errors leading to a Game Two loss. In the final game, Febiven played the reverse matchup of Game One, picking Corki and being up against Faker's Zed. Although he was able to maintain his footing in lane, Faker repeatedly roamed participating in seven kills by 16 minutes while Febiven had only participated in two. The game was too far gone, and the poke coming from Corki was unable to deter SKT from steamrolling the rest of the team leading to a 22 minute surrender and Fnatic's final loss at IEM.

Rekkles: Unable to take down Bang to claim IEM Championship

Name: Martin ""Rekkles"" Larsson

Team: Fnatic

Update: Rekkles had an impressive showing in the first two games against SKT, but faltered in the third, earning a series KDA of 7/10/10.

Analysis:Being given Kog Maw in Game One, Rekkles had the task of carrying his team resting on his shoulders. After picking up an early kill, he was able to assist his team in pushing their lead and gaining resulting objectives. His positioning in early fights was immaculate, kiting away from the Poppy, Braum, and Gragas who attempted to dive him constantly. After 23 minutes, he had still not died and was boasting a 1/0/3 scoreline but was met with a flank to earn his first death of the game. 30 minutes in showed the game was neck and neck but a team fight resulted in Rekkles unable to output the necessary damage to carry his team and SKT rallied to quickly close out Game One. In Game Two Rekkles was on Kog Maw once again, and similar to Game One started out with a lead by picking up first blood. He was able to push his lead by gaining a farm advantage and forcing Bang to play passively. Unfortunately, he was unable to match the dive from an aggressive SKT and after getting aced at dragon, Fnatic was unable to comeback and fell after a long drawn out game. Rekkles earned a KD of 5/3/4 in Game Two. Rekkles appeared to be exhausted in Game Three and played poorly. His Kalista was quickly dominated by a roaming Zed and he was unable to do anything except continue to spiral downwards. After a disappointing 22 minutes, he had a 0/4/1 scoreline and his team opted to surrender, conceding the IEM Championship to SKT .

Klaj: Rookie unable to stand up against World Champions in series loss

Name: Johan ""Klaj"" Olsson

Team: Fnatic

Update: Klaj had a valiant performance against World Champions SKT, but was unable to outclass them earning a 2/14/16 KDA in three losses.

Analysis:Klaj had an overall disappointing performance against SKT but one that was nothing short of expected. After joining Fnatic earlier this year, the team has not found much success and being pitted against the World Champions is one of the most daunting tasks to throw a rookie into. In Game One, he was able to assist in picking up some early kills for his team and a small lead, but it came at the cost of several deaths. His play was strong, but not nearly enough to keep SKT down who wiped Fnatic in a fight and quickly closed out the game with their lead. Klaj opted for Thresh in Game Two, and played slightly better than his previous games performance. He hit several impressive hooks and flays, but as his jungle and top lane fell behind, so did the rest of the team. A long drawn out game resulted in a 1/6/5 KDA as SKT's bot lane had free reign and dominated the map. In an attempt to redeem his previous performance, Klaj once again picked Thresh in the final game of the series. This game was the shortest of all of them as Klaj and Rekkles were unable to stand up to their opponents in the bot lane who quickly gained a lead and completely shut Rekkles down. As Klaj attempted to make plays to get his team back in the game SKT capitalized and got star player Faker extremely ahead, forcing Fnatic to surrender at 22 minutes and making them the IEM Katowice 2016 Second Place finishers.

MARCH 5, 2016

Xmithie: Good start to series but can't finish, lose in three to Fnatic

Name: Jake ""Xmithie"" Puchero

Team: Counter Logic

Update: Xmithie had a 6/11/28 KDA in series loss to Fnatic.

Analysis: Xmithie was able to farm his way to a gold lead in Game 1 and was a split push threat but mainly stuck with his teammates to team fight. The team fights were mainly just buying time for Darshan to split push, and it paid off with a win. The last two games of the series had similar starts and finishes for CLG. It would get an early lead but started to get picked apart in team fights which allowed FNC to take over the game and win.

Huhi:Tough series loss to Fnatic after strong start

Name: Choi ""Huhi"" Jae-hyun

Team: Counter Logic

Update: Huhi finished with an 18/14/22 KDA in series loss to Fnatic

Analysis: Huhi had solid Lulu play Game 1 in the best-of-three series and finished with a 3/2/10 KDA. He made good use of Wild Growth to save teammates multiple times and turn team fights around for CLG. Huhi did waste his teleport summoner spell early in Game 1, but it didn't hurt CLG. In Game 2, he picked Pantheon and it worked well for him in the early and mid game, but fell off late. Pantheon is a strange pick for a mid laner, but FNC also had a rarely seen pick in middle lane, Quinn. CLG's team fighting started to unravel late in the Game 2, and its problems continued into Game 3. FNC made get picks and flanks to dominate team fights in the second half of Game 3 and win the series.

Stixxay: Reverse swept in series loss to Fnatic

Name: Trevor ""Stixxay"" Hayes

Team: Counter Logic

Update: Stixxay finished with an 18/10/23 KDA in Counter Logic Gaming's loss to Fnatic

Analysis: Stixxay had a great Game 1 on Ezreal and finished with a 7/1/8 KDA. In team fights, he sat in the back line and dealt damage, and if he ever got in a bad situation, Aphromoo was there to save him with a Thresh lantern. Game 2 started out well for Stixxay, but CLG started to get picked apart during team fights in the late game and lost. Game 3 was a lot like Game 2, but faster. CLG had a small early lead, but once team fights started, FNC took over the game.

Aphromoo: Strong team play early, falls off late in series loss to Fnatic

Name: Zaqueri ""Aphromoo"" Black

Team: Counter Logic

Update: Aphromoo finished with a 10/11/39 KDA in the series loss to Fnatic

Analysis: Aphromoo was CLG's playmaker in Game 1 of the series. His play on Thresh was near perfect. There were numerous Lantern saves throughout the game and plenty of hooks that resulted in an assist. Games 2 and 3 didn't go as well for him and CLG. While it would get out to good starts, its team fights became sloppy later in the game and FNC took over and won. Aphromoo had great kill participation throughout the series and was one of the better playmakers for CLG.

Darshan: Split push not enough to best Fnatic

Name: Darshan ""Darshan"" Upadhyaha

Team: Counter Logic

Update: Darshan finished with a 8/12/13 KDA in the series loss to Fnatic.

Analysis: Darshan used Vladimir as his counter pick in Game 1 and won lane. Vladimir is very slow at knocking down tower, but Darshan was still able to make successful split pushes throughout the game. Game 2 went well for Darshan and CLG in the beginning, but it couldn't win a team fight late that allowed it enough time to finish, and FNC made a come from behind victory. Its team fighting problems continued and cost it Game 3 and the best-of-three series. Darshan stuck to split pushing this series, and it was successful in Game 1, where his team was winning fights without him, but his team couldn't hold up without him in later games.

Xmithie: Poor team fights in loss to SKT

Name: Jake ""Xmithie"" Puchero

Team: Counter Logic

Update: Xmithie got off to a decent start but couldn't help his team rally from behind against SKT. LoL news archive Looking for more League of Legends news? Read the archives here.

Analysis: CLG opted for a team fighting composition rather than sticking to their split push strategy that worked well for them in the North American LCS. Xmithie picked up CLG's first kill on Duke but wasn't much of a factor for the rest of the game and finished with a 1/1/0 KDA. CLG's team fights weren't very good partially because Xmithie didn't land many useful Gragas ultimates to help his team get picks. SKT's early gold lead grew for the rest of the game and CLG wasn't able to overcome it.

Darshan: Picked tank top instead of split pusher in loss to SKT

Name: Darshan ""Darshan"" Upadhyaha

Team: Counter Logic

Update: Darshan got caught out early and wasn't able to make much of an impact in team fights.

Analysis: While CLG had success with a split pushing strategy they didn't use that strategy against SKT. Darshan, usually CLG's main split pusher, picked the tank top laner Poppy and finished with a 0/2/0 KDA. CLG's team composition was all about team fighting but they didn't have very good team fights. SKT's poke was too much for CLG and they got chunked down very quickly before they could make a strong engage. They kept things close but SKT got too much of a gold lead and dominated fights and neutral team objectives on their way to defeating CLG.

MARCH 4, 2016

Yell0wStaR: Comfort picks in series sweep of ESC Ever

Name: Bora ""Yell0wStaR"" Kim

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Yellowstar picked Alistar in both games against ESC ever and finished with a 1/1/28 KDA.

Analysis: Yellowstar played as Alistar in both games against ESC Ever and was the only tank in TSM's lineup. Overall he did great at setting up and engaging in fights but did have some sloppy fights in the first game. Being the only tank meant that he was in the front line soaking up a lot of damage in both games but he kept his deaths low and only died once. The first game of the series ESC stayed close for the most part and fell off in the end but the second game was all TSM.

Doublelift: Rakes in kills and assists in sweep of ESC Ever

Name: Yiliang ""Doublelift"" Peng

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Doublelift had the highest kill participation in series against ESC Ever and finished with a 14/4/16 KDA.

Analysis: Doublelift started off slow in the first game of the series but had a strong game from start to finish in the second to beat ESC Ever 2-0. He picked Kog'Maw in game one and finished with a 10/4/9 KDA. Some of his deaths could have been easily avoided because they were caused by poor pathing through unwarded parts of the jungle and being too far forward in team fights.

These mistakes were corrected in Game Two where Doublelift picked Ezreal and finished with a 4/0/7 KDA. ESC Ever was only able to stay in Game One thanks to TSM's inability to put together a clean team fight. The second game TSM put together much better team fights and only gave up three kills on their way to winning the game and series.

Bjergsen: Near perfect KDA against ESC Ever

Name: Soren ""Bjergsen"" Bjerg

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Bjergsen put up a 14/1/10 KDA in the sweep of ESC Ever.

Analysis: Bjergsen played great with his team in the first game on Zilean and finished with a 6/1/8 KDA. He landed some solid double bomb stuns in team fights and saved his teammates lives throughout the game with Zilean's ultimate. TSM put up some poorly coordinated team fights but slowly pushed in all lanes on ESC and won the game with a Baron power play.

The second game Bjergsen got fed on LeBlanc, and finished with an 8/0/2 KDA. TSM had a gold lead early which grew for the rest of the game. TSM was able to be more coordinated in fights during the second game, and trend they would like to continue if they want to beat Royal Never Give Up in the next round.

Svenskeren: Got team early lead with first blood in both games

Name: Dennis ""Svenskeren"" Johnsen

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Svenskeren was the jungler to make the first ganks in each game and finished the series with a 4/3/19 KDA.

Analysis: Svenskeren was able to help his team get first blood in both games against ESC Ever in the best-of-three series. The early lead was squandered in the first game because of sloppy team fights but TSM was able to build a tower lead and eventually get a Baron Nashor buff for a final push to win. Svenskeren got picked off in some team fights but finished with a solid 1/3/13 KDA on Lee Sin.

During the second game TSM's early gold lead helped the team snowball their way to victory. Game Two was pretty clean for TSM overall and they only gave up three deaths, none of which came from Svenskeren who finished with a 3/0/6 KDA on Elise.

Hauntzer: Applied split push pressure in sweep of ESC Ever

Name: Kevin ""Hauntzer"" Yarnell

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Hauntzer played split push champions in the series against ESC Ever and finished with a 6/5/13 KDA.

Analysis: Hauntzer was a split pushing menace in Game One on Fiora and finished with a 4/2/8 KDA. He had a great start to the game by picking up a double kill for first blood and was able to have a lead in lane for the rest of the game. TSM put together some sloppy team fights in the mid game which allowed ESC Ever to stay in the game. Hauntzer was able to split push which drew Crazy, ESC's only tank, out of team fights, leaving TSM a favorable 4-vs-4 match up. TSM kept the pressure on ESC Ever and slowly pushed in all lanes before getting Baron Nashor and pushing to win.

In the second game Fiora was picked by ESC and Hauntzer decided to pick Quinn against it. Hauntzer got help from his team to get a kill and tower advantage in lane and then roamed for rest of the game. He made some mistakes overextending in team fights which got himself killed those became the only deaths of the game for TSM as the club performed well. TSM's team fights were much cleaner in the second game which allowed them to snowball their way to victory and complete the sweep of ESC Ever in the best of three series.

Looper: Runs away with a favorable matchup

Name: Jang ""Looper"" Hyeong-seok

Team: Royal Never Give Up

Update: While Looper's 3/2/10 KDA may not raise any eyebrows, his impact on RNG's win over Ever cannot be overstated.

Analysis: Sometimes, players win their advantages by the most slim of margins in a contest of skill, between two evenly matched opponents. Then other times one player blind picks a Vladimir. Fortunately for Looper, his opponent Crazy did the latter. With nearly no hesitation Looper locked in the Quinn that he introduced to the LPL meta, with results that were as predictable as the changing of seasons.

While Looper never found himself in a position to kill Crazy outright until the end of the game, where it notably caused RNG to win within 90 seconds, he did dominate the lane to the point where he nearly passed the vaunted ""Flame Horizon"", the colloquial name for having a hundred more minion kills than the enemy laner. While his teleports and team fighting was a bit rough, that was never his purpose to begin with, and despite it his team never lost a fight outright. This game will certainly serve as a warning to other teams later on in this tournament: a warning that while Looper might not yet be his 2014 self, he's on his way back.

KeY: Feeds hard in Game Two of Series

Name: Han-gi ""KeY"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Key ended Ever's 0-2 series loss to TSM with a 1/12/8 KDA on Bard.

Analysis: Playing Bard in both games, his Game One performance was decent despite giving away first blood. He was able to help Ever keep the game close by setting up kills with his Cosmic Binding and resetting fights using his ultimate. It wasn't enough for the win but it was certainly better than his game two performance where he went 0/7/0. An awful showing on his best champion, he was caught repeatedly out of position to give away easy kills as TSM snowballed the game for a 2-0 series win.

LoKeN: Can't carry Ever to series win over TSM

Name: Lee ""LoKeN"" Dong-Wook

Team: Ever

Update: Loken ended Ever's series loss to TSM with a 3/8/6 KDA.

Analysis: Loken laned swapped and farmed early in both games, one on Kalista and one on Lucian. He was killed early in Game One as Ever gave over a double kill to Hauntzer on Fiora. That caused Ever to struggle to deal with the TSM top laner and they were split pushed down throughout the game. In Game Two Ever was thoroughly dominated and Loken struggled to have any major effect on the game, only picking up an assist.

Tempt: Up and down performance on Lux

Name: Kang ""Tempt"" Myung-Gu

Team: Ever

Update: Tempt finished Ever's series loss to TSM with a 3/3/7 KDA.

Analysis: Playing Lux in both games, Tempt had decent moments but nothing carry worthy. In Game One he used his teleport to support his team around the map picking up kills and helping keep the game close. In Game Two, however, he had no real effect, only able to pick up one assist after falling behind Bjergsen. His team also fell behind and TSM took an easy Game Two win.

Ares: Poor Graves performance highlights series loss

Name: Min-kwon ""Ares"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Ares finished Ever's series loss to TSM with a 4/8/7 KDA.

Analysis: Ares played Graves and then Nidalee and in both performances were the team was left wanting more by the Korean jungler. In Game One he struggled to really deal damage on Graves in team fights and was killed often as he was out of position in the frontline. Similar things happened in Game Two as he farmed well but had no real chance to gank lanes or team fight with TSM dominating the game from the start.

Crazy: Given no chance to split push

Name: Jah-hee ""Crazy"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Crazy ended Ever's series loss to TSM with a 3/8/4 KDA.

Analysis: Playing Nautilus in Game One, he tried to set up kills using his ultimate and hook early on in the game with moderate success. As the game wore on he really struggled to deal with Hauntzer's split push and struggled to stay alive long enough in team fights to set up kills. In Game Two he tried his hand at split pushing on Fiora, but Ever was dominated by TSM. He fell behind early in lane and never got a chance to split push as TSM controlled the map and snowballed the game early.

mIxg: Puts up an incredible MVP performance on Nidalee

Name: Liu ""mlxg"" Shi-yu

Team: Royal Never Give Up

Update: mlxg ripped Ever apart with his spectacular Nidalee play, earning himself a 5/0/9 KDA in his victory over them.

Analysis: It's long been held that China, moreso than any other region, has a surfeit of gifted Nidalee players. mlxg sure lived up to that reputation in his game against Ever, going completely unkilled while managing to find himself advantages all around the map. His map play, though, was only the beginning, as his team fighting was the stuff of legends.

In mlxg's hands, Nidalee seemed to be more than the mediocre team fighting champion she is typically viewed as. Instead, he found the perfect balance between poking from afar and diving into the fray, finding himself kills in circumstances that looked all but lost. That he managed to stand out with such distinction even in a game that was RNG's from beginning to end is a testament to the skill with which he performed.

Xiaohu: Fearlessly starts fights he knows his team will finish

Name: Li ""Xiaohu"" Yuan-Hao

Team: Royal Never Give Up

Update: Xiaohu, in a complete departure from his style earlier today, took up Lissandra, earning a 3/1/11 KDA while getting RNG the fights they wanted.

Analysis: In a complete 180 from his performance earlier today, Xiaohu decided to bring Lissandra in the first game, favoring a more engage-heavy style after his Corki was picked away. The pick proved fortituous for RNG, as Ever opted into an incredibly fragile composition who had few that could survive the full burst of Xiaohu, and that had few ways to lock her down. Each fight throughout the game saw Xiaohu get multiple key CC's off while zoning Ever out of the fight.

By the time the game was drawing to a close, Ever was afraid even to pass by him while he was locked away in Zhonya's hourglass, only too aware of the grisly end that would await them were they to get too close. While Xiaohu might not have earned the most impressive looking score in the game, it was his zoning and initiation that allowed his allies to carry the fight, making him a key link in their success.

Mithy: Bloodthirsty game one doesn't equate to series win

Name: Alfonso ""Mithy"" Aguirre Rodriguez

Team: Origen

Update: Mithy ended Origen's three game series against TSM with a 4/9/34 KDA.

Analysis: Mithy played well throughout the series with two games on Thresh and a game on Braum. His game two Thresh performance was excellent as he landed multiple hooks throughout the game to finish with a game high 20 assists. The same can be said in Game One as he was able to consistently land hooks, but also was a bit blood thirsty picking up four kills in the game. Game Three he was able to help Origen to an early lead using Braum's passive to set up kills and help push down objectives. It wasn't enough in the end as TSM steam rolled Origen in team fights to take a 2-1 series win.

Zven: Plays well despite series loss to TSM

Name: Jesper ""Zven"" Svenningsen

Team: Origen

Update: Zven finished Origen's series loss to TSM with a 24/6/12 KDA.

Analysis: Zven was able to perform well in two losses on Lucian and dominated in Origen's win on Kalista. The Kalista game showed just how good he is on the champion as he hard carried, going 13/2/6 in Origen's one win. Even in their losses he was able to give Origen their best chance of winning picking up kills and dealing damage. Zven farmed well throughout the series and although his team was knocked out, they had a good showing at IEM 2016.

PowerOfEvil: No standout performances as Origen are knocked out of IEM

Name: Tristan ""PowerOfEvil"" Schrage

Team: Origen

Update: PowerOfEvil ended Origen's three game series against TSM with a 10/12/19 KDA.

Analysis: PowerOfEvil used Lissandra, Twisted Fate, and Talon in the three games with his best performance coming on Twisted Fate in Game Two. In the two losses he fell behind Bjergsen early and in Game One he was mainly used to try to set up kills for his teammates. In his good Game Two performance he still struggled to effectively roam the map using his ultimate and teleport but did set up kills in team fights using his gold card. In Game Three he went with Talon and started well, but as the game wore on he couldn't effectively assassinate TSM carries in team fights.

Amazing: Decent objective control despite lost series

Name: Maurice ""Amazing"" Stuckenschneider

Team: Origen

Update: Amazing finished Origen's best of three series against TSM with a 7/9/27 KDA.

Analysis: Amazing played Nidalee and two Elise games in the three game series as TSM knocked Origen out of IEM Katowice. He played decently throughout the series helping Origen to control objectives including dragon and Rift Herald while pushing lanes. He performed better on Elise helping to secure kills by rooting champions using her cocoon ability to rack up assists. In the end it wasn't enough as TSM was able to come out with a 2-1 series win.

sOAZ: sOAZ can't split push Origen to series win

Name: Paul ""sOAZ"" Boyer

Team: Origen

Update: sOAZ finished Origen's best of three series against TSM with a 3/10/30 KDA.

Analysis: sOAZ played Poppy and two Trundle games in the series as Origen was knocked out of IEM Katowice. He looked to split push in all three games but only really found success in Origen's Game Two win. The underlying deterrent in the series for sOAZ was his inability to play safely at times, overextending and giving away easy kills in all three games. He tried to front line but again only found success in Game Two, going 3/2/18 on Trundle.

Xiaohu: Fearlessly starts fights he knows his team will finish

Name: Li ""Xiaohu"" Yuan-Hao

Team: Royal Never Give Up

Update: Xiaohu, in a complete departure from his style earlier today, took up Lissandra, earning a 3/1/11 KDA while getting RNG the fights they wanted.

Analysis: In a complete 180 from his performance earlier today, Xiaohu decided to bring Lissandra in the first game, favoring a more engage-heavy style after his Corki was picked away. The pick proved fortituous for RNG, as Ever opted into an incredibly fragile composition who had few that could survive the full burst of Xiaohu, and that had few ways to lock her down. Each fight throughout the game saw Xiaohu get multiple key CC's off while zoning Ever out of the fight.

By the time the game was drawing to a close, Ever was afraid even to pass by him while he was locked away in Zhonya's hourglass, only too aware of the grisly end that would await them were they to get too close. While Xiaohu might not have earned the most impressive looking score in the game, it was his zoning and initiation that allowed his allies to carry the fight, making him a key link in their success.

Xiaohu: Leads the team in kills after victory over Origen

Name: Li ""Xiaohu"" Yuan-Hao

Team: Royal Never Give Up

Update: Xiaohu showed up with his Corki pick, one he has become well known for in his native China, posting an admirable 7/1/5 KDA on his way to blowing Origen out of the water.

Analysis: RNG's first game on the stage managed to both highlight their strengths and weaknesses simultaneously. While their trademark aggression pulled them through in the end, they also suffered ""the curse of China"", or failing to adapt to the styles of international opponents. The early lane swap favored Origen heavily, as RNG was slow to react. That had little effect on Xiaohu, though, who fearlessly faced off against PowerOfEvil's Leblanc as if he were on even footing, constantly forcing aggressive trades. He even forsook the traditional first purchase, Hexdrinker, that Corki players favor in the matchup, instead opting for the pure damage that a Sheen offered.

One certainly can't argue with the results he found, though, as his burst combined with mlxg's initiation ability was key to RNG's efforts in wresting control of the game. His pressure over mid lane was so great that he even found the opportunity to roam the map and assist the side lanes, a feat nearly unheard of in this matchup. While RNG might have made missteps in this game as a whole, it's hard to fault Xiaohu directly for them, his role being the most isolated from the early game where the mistakes were made. Considering his amazing performance even while behind, veteran LPL viewers will be excited to see how far this up and coming talent can go in a tournament filled with some of the greatest mid laners in the world, including the reigning world champion, Faker.

mIxg: Dismantles Origens composition with spectacular Gragas play

Name: Liu ""mlxg"" Shi-yu

Team: Royal Never Give Up

Update: mlxg punished Origen's reliance on Kog'maw as a damage source, constantly pressuring him out of dealing damage while taking a win with a 3/1/9 KDA.

Analysis: A big question heading into this event was whether China would adapt to the strategies that their opponents would field, as their region is notorious for bring both insular and slow to adapt. Many of those fears proved founded in RNG's first game, as Origen started the game with a considerable gold lead just due to their slow play in the laneswap. That didn't slow down RNG's ace rookie jungler, however, who joined Mata in forming a death squad with one target: sOAZ. The beleaguered Frenchman found no reprieve throughout the game, as every overextension was immediately punished by death.

As the game wore on, though, mlxg seamlessly transisitoned into a different role, one with a new target: Zven. Throughout the few teamfights that this game features, Zven never found the opening he needed in order to bring Kog'Maw's full damage potential to bear. Every time he tried mlxg was there, forcing him to once again reposition. Overall, while the game wasn't as dominant a showing from RNG as many might have expected, they showed a level of tenacity that veteran LPL viewers have come to expect from them, always managing to find the fights that would allow them to take back the game

Looper: Upstages sOAZ as the split push king

Name: Jang ""Looper"" Hyeong-seok

Team: Royal Never Give Up

Update: Looper ran away with a lane advantage against sOAZ, pressuring Origen from whatever lane he was in on his way to a 2/1/5 KDA.

Analysis: For fans of the LPL, the beginning of this game was like a nightmare come true. Time and again have Chinese teams traveled to international competitions, only to fail utterly due to a lack of adaptation to the opponents they faced there. While this game would not end in failure for RNG, the early laneswap was all but catastrophic for them. Looper, however, would be instrumental in reversing that gold deficit, as his pressure of sOAZ kept Origen from ever being in a position to really capitalize on their gold lead, especially due to their unorthodox composition that had few answers to the incredible waveclear that a Corki and Ezreal can bring to the table.

Along with the rest of his team, Looper looked to punish sOAZ's tendency for greedy plays, and punish it they did, with sOAZ failing to find a kill the entire game and earning most of his six deaths alone in the side lane. Overall, while the game wasn't as dominant a showing from RNG as many might have expected, they showed a level of tenacity that veteran LPL viewers have come to expect from them, always managing to find the fights that would allow them to take back the game.

KeY: Faux-tank can't front line for Ever

Name: Han-gi ""KeY"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Key ended Game Three of IEM Katowice with a 0/4/4 KDA on Braum.

Analysis: Key initiated a lane swap early and helped to fast push down the top tier one tower. He was able to pick up two assists in the game's first team fight and used his shield well to block poke damage early on. Unfortunately, he was looked to as the front line tank for Ever and just wasn't ever tanky enough to sustain damage in team fights. Once he was killed, Ever lacked any front line presence and RNG destroyed their squishy lineup.

LoKeN: Unable to take over Game Three

Name: Lee ""LoKeN"" Dong-Wook

Team: Ever

Update: Loken finished Game Three of IEM Katowice with a 2/3/2 KDA on Ezreal.

Analysis: Ever had an eye for the late game but RNG never let them get there. Loken initiated a lane swap early and fast pushed down the tier one tower. Like the rest of his team he attempted to farm through the early and mid game to pick up items and scale up. Despite being able to pick up a kill and an assist in the first team fight of the game, he was killed quickly in team fights as RNG rolled through Ever's squishy lineup.

Tempt: Dominated in team fights

Name: Kang ""Tempt"" Myung-Gu

Team: Ever

Update: Tempt finished Game Three of IEM Katowice with a 1/3/3 KDA as Corki.

Analysis: Despite farming well and keeping xiaohu in check on Lissandra, Tempt struggled to take over the game in any way. He stayed even in lane and had an eye on scaling for the late game, but RNG never let him get there. He picked up his only kill and an assist in the games first team fight but could only manage two more assists the rest of the game as RNG dominated in 5-vs-5 fights.

Ares: Can't provide the damage to win fights

Name: Min-kwon ""Ares"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Ares ended Game Three of IEM Katowice with a 0/3/2 KDA as Graves.

Analysis: Ares farmed much better early on in this game compared to game one but lost map control and objective control to mlxg. He was able to pick up two assists, but really couldn't consistently deal damage in team fights to help Ever win the game. With no real front line and three AD Carry champions in their roster, you have to wonder if a tank jungler or top laner would've helped Ever more.

Crazy: Unique champion doesn't pay off

Name: Jah-hee ""Crazy"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Crazy finished Game Three of IEM Katowice with a 3/4/0 KDA on Vladimir.

Analysis: A weird pick for Crazy that didn't quite pay off. He helped fast push the top tier one early but gave away first blood after falling victim to a five man gank in the top lane. This caused him to fall well behind Looper in their top lane matchup, having a 45 CS deficit at sixteen minutes. He was able to pick up a few kills, but he couldn't stop Looper from split pushing and didn't deal enough area-of-effect damage in team fights to win the game.

Mithy: Good start doesn't translate into late game success

Name: Alfonso ""Mithy"" Aguirre Rodriguez

Team: Origen

Update: Mithy ended Game Two of IEM Katowice with a 0/2/3 KDA as Thresh.

Analysis: A good start as he helped fast push both side lane tier one towers and the bottom tier two towers in the first eight minutes. He was able to use his hooks well to engage in team fights, but Origen lacked the necessary damage to instantly kill anyone he landed a hook on. As Origen was dominated in team fights he struggled to really provide enough CC to help his team turn the tide.

Zven: Shut down by RNG

Name: Jesper ""Zven"" Svenningsen

Team: Origen

Update: Zven finished Game Two of IEM Katowice with a 2/4/2 KDA on Kog'maw.

Analysis: Things looked good for the marksman early on as he fast pushed both side lane tier one towers and the bottom tier two tower in the first eight minutes of the game. He was able to roam the map early as he farmed, pressuring towers and running RNG around the map. Once RNG began to force team fights, things changed, as they focused Zven and killed him quickly in fights. Despite picking up a double kill in the second team fight of the game, Origen could not consistently peel for Zven and allow him to deal the necessary damage to turn fights in their favor.

PowerOfEvil: Struggles to effect game in any way

Name: Tristan ""PowerOfEvil"" Schrage

Team: Origen

Update: PowerOfEvil finished OG's Game Two loss at IEM Katowice with a 0/2/0 KDA on Leblanc.

Analysis: Despite farming even early on and looking to bully xiaohu, PowerOfEvil really could not do anything to help Origen win this game. In team fights he attempted to deal damage but couldn't find any opportunities to assassinate the RNG carries. Overall it was an anonymous game for the Origen mid laner.

Amazing: Can't create enough map pressure

Name: Maurice ""Amazing"" Stuckenschneider

Team: Origen

Update: Amazing ended Game Two of IEM Katowice with a 2/2/1 KDA on Elise.

Analysis: Things looked all right early on for Origen and Amazing as he farmed strongly and was able to pick up the Rift Herald buff to pressure down the bottom tier two tower early. Problems came for the OG jungler: he couldn't gank for his laners with Origen looking to focus on objectives over team fighting. It turned out the objective play was for good reason as RNG dominated team fights leaving Amazing struggling to provide any help.

sOAZ: Gives away easy kills

Name: Paul ""sOAZ"" Boyer

Team: Origen

Update: sOAZ finished Game Two of IEM Katowice with a 0/6/2 KDA as Nautilus.

Analysis: Another poor performance from sOAZ as his suspect positioning led to a lot of deaths. Early on he helped to fast push the bottom tier one tower before going to the top lane to farm. When he arrived in the top lane he overextended and was caught out to give away first blood. A little further into the game he was caught overextending in the bottom lane to give up a second easy kill. He couldn't effectively set up kills or provide a front line presence for Origen, and they were dominated in team fights.

KeY: Shows off his skills on Bard

Name: Han-gi ""KeY"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Key ended Game One at IEM Katowice with a 2/4/13 KDA on Bard.

Analysis: Although Ever fell way behind early, Key looked very good all game long playing the champion he's made his name on. Despite being bullied in the 2-vs-2 lane and giving away a kill to Yellowstar, Key and Loken were the main factor keeping Ever in the game early. He was able to set up kills using his ultimate to create picks and hitting multiple two man Cosmic Bindings that helped ever win 5-vs-5 fights even with a huge gold differential in favor of TSM.

LoKeN: Carries Ever to huge comeback victory

Name: Lee ""LoKeN"" Dong-Wook

Team: Ever

Update: Loken finished Game One of IEM Katowice with a 7/3/6 KDA on Lucian.

Analysis: Despite being bullied in the 2-vs-2 lane by TSM and falling behind in CS, Loken played well throughout the game. It looked like it was going to be a very one sided affair early as he was killed during a five man gank in the top lane, but once Ever started to 5-vs-5 they found some success. Loken's huge damage on Lucian helped to carry Ever in team fights as his team was able to set up kills for their marksman to capitalize on.

Tempt: Helps lead comeback despite poor early game

Name: Kang ""Tempt"" Myung-Gu

Team: Ever

Update: Tempt finished Ever's IEM Katowice Game One win with a 3/4/12 KDA on Twisted Fate.

Analysis: Tempt was a huge part of Ever's surprising comeback in this one. He fell behind early in this one attempting to roam, but was killed during a 3-vs-3 fight in the bottom lane. Ever gave away three kills without being able to pick one up for themselves, and moments later Tempt was killed during a TSM five man gank in the top lane.

Tempt was able to keep the faith however and claimed Ever's first kill in the game's first 5-vs-5 fight. As Ever started to come back, he was able to use his Gold Card in combination with his team's crowd control abilities and picked up a huge double kill in the final team fight of the game.

Ares: Struggles with his positioning

Name: Min-kwon ""Ares"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Ares ended Game One of IEM Katowice with a 1/6/4 KDA.

Analysis: Despite the big comeback win for Ever, this was an ugly game for Ares. He farmed early, invading the TSM jungle to take camps but failed a bottom lane dive that led to Ever giving away three kills without claiming one for themselves. His positioning was poor in this game, getting caught out of position to give away kills, and being in the front line during team fights to get killed early in every team fight.

Crazy: Name defines Game One

Name: Jah-hee ""Crazy"" Kim

Team: Ever

Update: Crazy finished Game One of IEM Katowice with a 3/6/8 KDA on Nautilus.

Analysis: This was a crazy game and an exciting way to kick off the tournament. It looked pretty bleak for both Crazy and Ever early on, and he was caught out of position to give away first blood in the game's first minute. Things got worse from there as he was killed in a 3-vs-3 fight in the bottom lane and couldn't provide a good front line tank early on in the game. As Ever started to come back, he used his ultimate and hook well to set up kills and once he got tanky, he helped Ever win team fights and eventually the game.

MARCH 3, 2016

FORG1VEN: Will remain with H2K-Gaming

Name: Konstantinos ""FORG1VEN"" Tzortziou

Team: H2K-Gaming

Update: FORG1VEN will remain with H2K-Gaming after he was granted a temporary deferment of military service.

Analysis: This is terrific news for both the team and FORG1VEN, as the club is currently tied atop the EU LCS standings with just two weeks left to play. While the Greek ADC has had a well-documented string of misfortune throughout his career, this bit of good news should allow for him to maintain his dominance over the competition for at least the Spring Split. He's currently fourth in the EU LCS in KDA (6.8) and is tied for fifth in the league in kills (52).

H2K will battle Team ROCCAT and Origen next week, the latter of which is expected to be the most bitter match left before playoffs. With FORG1VEN back on the roster and a week of rest and practice ahead of them, it should give H2K the best possible chances of earning the victory.

Sonstar: Replaces Adryh as Giants marksman

Name: Son ""S0NSTAR"" Seung-ik

Team: Giants Gaming

Update: Giants Gaming have announced Sonstar will take over as their AD Carry for the remainder of the Split.

Analysis: S0NSTAR replaces the disappointing Adryh in Giants lineup and will look to provide the spark that keeps them in the European top flight league next split. S0NSTAR joins after playing for South Korea's Incredible Miracle last split, playing in nine games while compiling a 34/21/45 KDA. Giants will hope their revamped lineup can save them from relegation and look to finish the Spring Split on a high note.

Wisdom: Takes over as new jungler

Name: Kim ""Wisdom"" Tae-wan

Team: Giants Gaming

Update: Wisdom will join Giants Gaming and take over as the new jungler, the team confirmed Monday.

Analysis: Wisdom, a 2015 World Championship runner-up with the KOO Tigers, will take over for betongjocke as the new jungler on Giants Gaming. He'll join former Incredible Miracle teammate S0NSTAR as the club looks to avoid relegation. They have a tough task in front of them, with games against Fnatic, G2 Esports, Origen and ROCCAT still on the docket.

Smittyj: Will become new top laner

Name: Lennart ""Smittyj"" Warkus

Team: Giants Gaming

Update: Smittyj will take over top lane duties for Giants Gaming, the team confirmed Monday.

Analysis: Giants Gaming made wholesale changes to their roster Monday, opting to release Atom, betongjocke and Adryh in an effort to maintain their spot in the EU LCS. While fans of Team Dignitas may recognize Smittyj after his one week performance with the North American club, ""disciplinary issues"" relegated the top laner to the bench for most of the Spring Split. However after a thorough study of his past history, Giants deemed the issue an ""isolated case"" and will look for their new roster to carry them out of the EU LCS cellar.

Adryh: Released by Giants

Name: Adrian ""Adryh"" Perez

Team: Giants Gaming

Update: In a surprising move, Giants opted to release long-time ADC Adryh on Monday.

Analysis: As part of a wholesale change that saw three of the five Giants members released Monday, Adryh will now hit the free agent market after a two-year stint with the team. While Giants may consider him a ""legend of their club"" he's been a bit of a disappointment this season, posting the lowest KDA (2.1) of any ADC to play 14 games. Still, considering his age (19) and his relatively pristine standing with his former team, there is certainly a chance Adryh could return to the LCS at some point in the future.

betongJocke: Let go by Giants

Name: Joachim ""betongJocke"" Rasmussen

Team: Giants Gaming

Update: betongjocke has been relieved of his duties by Giants, the team confirmed Monday.

Analysis: Along with rookie top laner Atom and Giants veteran Adryh, the team opted to release betongJocke in an attempt to salvage their spot in the EU LCS after what has amounted to a dismal season for the European club. In 10 games betongjocke tallied just nine kills compared to 39 deaths, putting forth a minuscule 1.3 KDA. He will be replaced by Wisdom, formerly of the KOO Tigers as the newly reformed Giants face their daunting remaining schedule, including games against Fnatic, G2 Esports, Origen and ROCCAT to round out the season.

Atom: Released by Giants

Name: Peter ""Atom"" Thomsen

Team: Giants Gaming

Update: Atom has been released by Giants, the team confirmed Monday.

Analysis: With Giants desperately trying to maintain their spot in the EU LCS, the club opted to make sweeping changes to the roster Monday, releasing three players including Atom. The rookie top laner had a disappointing start to his LCS career, ranking dead last in the league in KDA when factoring in games played, as well as leading his postion in deaths with 48. Smittyj will take over at top lane as the team attempts to crawl out of the cellar with just four games left on the schedule.

FEB. 28, 2016

Crumbzz: Another strong start turns to loss

Name: Alberto ""Crumbzz"" Rengifo

Team: Renegades

Update: Crumbzz's early kill was his only and finished with a 1/2/0 KDA on Rek'Sai against NRG on Saturday.

Analysis: Crumbzz punished KonKwon for wandering into his jungle by himself but couldn't find a kill or assists for the rest of the game. He and Renegades have had strong starts in a lot of their losses but couldn't keep their leads late and lost. That pattern continued in this game, Renegades had a team gold advantage for most of the game but slowly gave up team objectives to let NRG get back into the game and win. Crumbzz couldn't get strong engages to stop NRG from pushing, and NRG dominated the late game fights. Renegades are going to have to start pressuring the opposing team more after getting their early leads if they want to keep it late game and win.

Freeze: Makes early invade, can't hold lead late

Name: Ales ""Freeze"" Knezinek

Team: Renegades

Update: Freeze drew first blood but couldn't make plays late and finished with a 1/2/0 KDA on Kalista Saturday.

Analysis: Renegades had strong starts in almost all of their games, and this game was no exception. Freeze made an early invade to get his team first blood on Moon but that was his only kill of the game. In late game fights he and Renegades couldn't find a good engage on NRG and were slowly pushed off team objectives and back into their base. Freeze's front line engagers got taken down too quickly in fights for him to be able to deal out much damage and ended with a pretty low damage dealt to champions. He's going to have to find ways to deal out more damage if Renegades wants to win games and climb from the bottom of the standings.

Impact: 100 percent kill participation in win

Name: Jung ""Impact"" Eon-yeong

Team: NRG eSports

Update: Impact and NRG overcome their slow start and come back late and get the win on Saturday.

Analysis: Impact finished with a 1/0/6 KDA on Poppy and had a 100 percent kill participation. He was one of three people on NRG to finish with 100 percent kill participation, which speaks to how well they were able to work as a team this game. Impact was in the front line to use Poppy's steadfast presence to stop Crumbz from diving into NRG's back line, which took away one of Renegades only fight engaging tools. His stats have been pretty consistent all split, and he always makes up for his low kill count with a lot of assists. If Impact continues to play those tanky top lane champions, his stats most likely won't deviate from the pattern.

GBM: Great team synergy against Renegades

Name: Lee ""GBM"" Chang-suk

Team: NRG eSports

Update: GBM finished with a perfect 0/0/7 KDA on Zilean and 100 percent kill participation Saturday against Renegades.

Analysis: GBM fell behind to AlexIch early but was able to get a small victory in lane by knocking down his tower first. All of NRG had a kind of slow start, and they were able to comeback by grouping to get team objectives and dominate team fights. GBM used Zilean's ult to stop his teammates from dying, which starved Renegades of kills in the late game. GBM also had the second most damage dealt to champions on NRG. He wasn't able to get any kills from all the damage he dealt, but Zilean is more of a support champion that gets played in the mid lane. If he starts playing assassins or other casters in the mid lane his kill counts will probably go up.

Moon: Tanks for team, keeps deaths to minimum

Name: Galen ""Moon"" Holgate

Team: NRG eSports

Update: Moon got taken down for first blood, but it was his only death in the game. He finished with a 2/1/5 KDA on Elise Saturday against Renegades.

Analysis: Despite having another front line tank in their lineup, Moon finished the game with the most damage taken on NRG. Absorbing a lot of damage can lead to high number of deaths, but GBM was able to save Moon with Zilean's ult multiple times to keep his deaths low. NRG was able to put together a lot of winning team fights and worked together very well throughout the mid and late game to make a comeback. Moon was one of three plays to finish with 100 percent kill participation on NRG. If they will need to keep putting together games like this against some of the top teams to stay in the top six teams.

KonKwon: Makes an early mistake, overcomes late to get win

Name: Kevin ""KonKwon"" Kwon

Team: NRG eSports

Update: KonKwon died early, but it was his only death of the game and finished with a 0/1/6 KDA on Janna Saturday.

Analysis: KonKwon wandered into Crumbzz's jungle by himself and gave him a kill, but that was arguably his only misplay of the game. He and NRG overcame their early deaths by winning all team fights in the mid and late game, which allowed them to come back and win the game. KonKown helped his team protect Lod to let him be their damage carry. The early death could've been avoided but, KonKwon still finished the game with solid support stats. It's not clear how long Lod will be stepping in for Altec, but he and KonKown seemed to work well together this game. Hopefully they can continue their solid play on Sunday against Team Impulse.

LOD: Finishes with perfect KDA in first game for NRG

Name: Benjamin ""LOD"" deMunck

Team: NRG eSports

Update: Lod had a slow start but was a damage dealing monster in the late game and finished with a 4/0/2 KDA on Kog'Maw Saturday against Renegades.

Analysis: Altec stepped down early last week, and Lod took his spot on NRG's line up for this week. Lod had a great first game and finished with a perfect KDA and was NRG's top damage dealer. NRG did a great job at protecting Lod in fights, which allowed him to be a damage dealing monster in team fights. NRG didn't seem to lose much team synergy with the substitute AD carry, and Lod will look to get them another win Sunday against another bottom team, Team Impulse.

Feng: Engages lead to victory

Name: Wang ""Feng"" Xiao Feng

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Feng was great at setting up kills for his team and finished with a 2/3/9 KDA on Nautilus against NRG eSports.

Analysis: The game started with lane swaps leaving the top lane match up pretty even. However, Impact got taken down for first blood, and Feng was able to start building a gold lead over him. TIP took over the second half of the game and dominated team objectives and team fights. Feng's role was to be a front line tank and engage in fights, and he played his role well this game. He was great at setting up kills with Nautilus's ult and harassing the damage dealers, which allowed the rest of his team to clean up in team fights. Feng and his teammates interrupted NRG attempting to get Baron Nashor and got the buff and wiped out most of NRG -- which pretty much won them the game.

Procxin: Bounces back against NRG eSports

Name: Kim ""Procxin"" Seyoung

Team: Team Impulse

Update:Procxin had a solid game on Nidalee and finished with a 3/1/7 KDA.

Analysis:Procxin and TIP were great at controlling the neutral team objectives against NRG. They were able to get a Rift Herald, four dragons, and a Baron Nashor -- while NRG only managed to get one dragon buff during the match. In team fights Procxin was great at soaking up and dealing damage for TIP, and he participated in all but five kills for TIP. This was a solid game for Procxin and TIP after their poor performance on Saturday.

Pirean: Main damage dealer in win

Name: Choi ""Pirean"" Jun-Sik

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Pirean had a close match up in lane but was able to pull out a victory against NRG eSports and finished with a 5/1/8 KDA on Viktor.

Analysis: Pirean and GBM were close for the entire game and even finished with similar stat lines. However, TIP was able to win a lot more team fights and dominated the neutral team objectives. In team fights Pirean was able to tear through the frontline tanks to open up the damage dealers in the back, which either forced a retreat or got his team kills. He finished the game with most damage dealt on TIP and tied for the highest kill participation with Mash. Pirean will have to put together more solid games like this for TIP to climb into the top six teams by the end of the split.

Mash: Doesn't have to hard carry in win

Name: Brandon ""Mash"" Phan

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Mash stayed even in lane and was still a big contributor late game as he finished with a 4/1/9 KDA on Kalista.

Analysis: Lane swaps early meant Mash didn't have to go through the traditional laning phase (which may have been a blessing this game). He and Lod stayed pretty close in gold most the game, but Mash pulled away late when TIP started dominating team fights. Mash was only the third most damage dealt to champions but tied for the highest kill participation. His only death came when he and TIP were overextended, and it didn't hurt much more than his stats. This was a good win for TIP in the standings, but the rest of the split they will go up against more teams at the top -- which will be a big challenge for them.

Gate: Has solid outing against NRG eSports

Name: Austin ""Gate"" Yu

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Gate set up multiple kills with Bard's ult and finished with a 1/2/9 KDA against NRG eSports.

Analysis: Gate looked much better on Bard in Sunday's game and finished with a better KDA than he did on Saturday. His Bard ult's were on point and got his team kills and himself a lot of assists. TIP avoided early mistakes this game and were able to take full control after securing their first Baron Nashor buff of the game. The rest of their schedule is pretty tough, and they will have to beat some top teams if they want into the playoffs.

Impact: Starved of CS early, can't come back

Name: Jung ""Impact"" Eon-yeong

Team: NRG eSports

Update: Impact had a slow start and couldn't overcome it, finishing the game with a 0/3/6 KDA on Tahm Kench.

Analysis: Early lane swaps and dying for first blood put Impact behind in lane as he was only able to get 14 CS in the first ten minutes of the game. He managed to get back into the game by picking up some assists, but the crowd control on TIP proved to be too much for him, and it cost him some deaths. Impact wasn't able to get to TIP's damage dealers during team fights to set up kills for the rest of his team. Instead, during fights he was forced to attempt to save his teammates from TIP and maybe pick up an assist when his team took down a member of TIP. He still managed to get a decent amount of assists, but he usually is able to pick up at least a kill per game. He was targeted in during bans, and he was forced off Poppy, who he has had some of his best games on this split, which teams might try against NRG again.

Moon: Has lackluster game on Gragas in loss

Name: Galen ""Moon"" Holgate

Team: NRG eSports

Update: Moon couldn't put together a winning team fight with his team and finished with a 0/3/5 KDA on Gragas.

Analysis: Moon took a lot of damage against TIP but couldn't return it. He was one of NRG's frontline tank and got chunked down too early in fights for him to help his team turn them around. Being chunked down early in fights also forced Moon to use Gragas's ult to disengage rather than to try and separate and pick off a member of TIP. He still manage a decent kill participation but it wasn't much since his team had a difficult time picking up kills this game.

GBM: Can't carry against Team Impulse

Name: Lee ""GBM"" Chang-suk

Team: NRG eSports

Update: GBM was NRG eSports' carry against Team Impulse but he couldn't do enough to get the win and finished with a 5/1/3 KDA on Orianna.

Analysis: GBM had the best overall stats for NRG in their loss Sunday. He finished with the second most damage dealt to champs, highest kill participation and most kills, but all of that couldn't stop TIP from winning the game. While he and NRG were able to pick up kills throughout the game, they couldn't win a team fight late to stop TIP from pushing and lost all hope of a comeback when they failed to get Baron Nashor late. GBM has been NRG's best player for most of the split, but he will have to find ways to pick up his teammates play for them to maintain a spot among the top six teams.

LOD: Can't repeat success on Kog'Maw in loss

Name: Benjamin ""LOD"" deMunck

Team: NRG eSports

Update: Lod was able to get a power pick in Kog'Maw but failed to put up a good game and finished with a 3/4/3 KDA.

Analysis: Lod wasn't able to get the protection from his team that he had on Saturday, and it showed in his stats. He still managed to deal out the most damage to champs despite having the most deaths on the team. TIP was able to force fights with NRG's flank open, which allowed TIP to harass and take him down or force him out of the fight. It's unclear whether Lod will be returning next week for NRG but it would be nice for them to not have to find another AD carry. If he continues on he and KonKown can hopefully build some synergy and keep their spot among the top six teams in the standings.

KonKwon: Can't disengage Team Impulse in fights

Name: Kevin ""KonKwon"" Kwon

Team: NRG eSports

Update: KonKwon finished wtih a 0/5/4 KDA on Janna in loss to Team Impulse.

Analysis: KonKwon had a lot of deaths and not much to show for it in Saturday's loss to Team Impulse. Team Impulse seemed to have more engaging utility than KonKwon could handle and finished with the most deaths on the team. He and NRG couldn't get a favorable team fight late game, and it forced them to make a risky call to get Baron Nashor. The call backfired and put TIP in full control of the game. KonKwon and Lod didn't have the kind of success that they did together on Saturday, but if Lod sticks around, and they play more games together, their synergy should improve.

Balls: Falls behind early, can't stop split push late

Name: An ""Balls"" Le

Team: Cloud9

Update: Balls had a rough game against Counter Logic Gaming and finished with a lowly 1/7/9 KDA on Lulu.

Analysis: Balls was taken down early by Darshan and Xmithie and fell behind in lane. Balls wasn't able to make a comeback in lane and stayed behind Darshan for the rest of the game. The set back was too much for him to be able to stop Darshan's split push alone and it cost them a inhibitor tower. Things were still in C9 favor when they got a Baron Nashor buff late but they weren't able to get more than a tower before CLG broke up their siege and wiped out all of C9. The death timers were too long and CLG's ensuing push knocked down two inhibitors and C9 couldn't come back from that. Balls might want to rethink playing Lulu in the top lane after this game and stick to his tanky bruisers like Darius.

Rush: Slow on the draw against Counter Logic Gaming, can't get early lead

Name: Lee ""Rush"" Yoonjae

Team: Cloud9

Update: Rush lost a close game to Counter Logic Gaming and finished with a 6/4/7 KDA on Lee Sin.

Analysis: While Rush is known to make aggressive plays early, we didn't see that Sunday against CLG. He was still good in teamfights and managed to pick up a good amount of kills and assists for C9 but wasn't able to get the early lead that he usually does. Rush ended the game with most damage taken but kept his deaths low because of Lee Sin's ability to shield himself and mobility to jump out of fights when he's close to death. The game seemed to be turning in Rush and C9 favor until their Baron empowered siege was interrupted by a Bard ult and they got wiped out in the following team fight. CLG was able to knock down a tower and two inhibitors because of C9's long death timers and it was too much for them to come back from.

Jensen: Solid performance in loss to Counter Logic Gaming

Name: Nicolaj ""Jensen"" Jensen

Team: Cloud9

Update: Jensen stayed close in lane but couldn't make the plays late game to get Cloud 9 a win.

Analysis: Jensen finished with a solid 6/4/10 KDA on LeBlanc in a loss to CLG. His laning phase was pretty even and stayed close in gold with Huhi for the entire game. In team fights Jensen was one of C9's top damage dealers and he finished with the second highest kill participation. However he was taken out early in the crucial team fight late and wasn't able to deal out much damage before dying. The long death timers let CLG knock down a tower and two inhibitors to take control of the game. C9 wasn't able to come back and died trying to defend the Nexus.

Sneaky: Can't hard carry Cloud9 to victory against Counter Logic Gaming

Name: Zachary ""Sneaky"" Scuderi

Team: Cloud9

Update: Sneaky had very good game against Counter Logic Gaming but fell short in the late game.

Analysis: Sneaky finished with a 10/2/3 KDA on Lucian in a loss to CLG on Sunday. He had the best KDA and dealt the most damage on C9 but he couldn't carry hard enough late game to get the win. Sneaky's front line protectors got torn through in a late game team fight which resulted in him and his teammates got wiped out. CLG was able to break open C9's base afterwards and C9 couldn't do anything to stop them from winning the game.

Hai: Comeback falls short in loss to Counter Logic Gaming

Name: Hai ""Hai"" Lam

Team: Cloud9

Update: Hai set up kills for his team but dies early in an late game team fight that cost Cloud9 the game.

Analysis: Hai finished with a 0/5/10 KDA on Alistar in a tough loss to CLG on sunday. He and Cloud9 got a Baron Nashor buff late game and were trying to siege their way in CLG's base but an ult from Bard stop the siege and allowed CLG to almost ace C9. Hai got blown early in the fight and couldn't protect C9's damage dealers from CLG. He had a decent amount of assists but couldn't set up the team fights late for his team.

Darshan: Got an early lead, became a split push threat late

Name: Darshan ""Darshan"" Upadhyaha

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Darshan's success on split pushing top laners continued against Cloud9.

Analysis: Darshan got help from Xmithie to get first blood on Balls and slowly grew a gold lead the rest of the game. He spent a lot of the game split pushing and got all the way to an inhibitor by himself. Balls wasn't enough to stop him alone and Jensen had to come help. However he was too late and Darshan had already exposed one of their inhibitors. Darshan dying to Jensen let C9 get a Baron Nashor buff but couldn't get much out of it. They were only able to knock down a tower before CLG was broke up their siege. Darshan was able to pick up a kill and some assists in the team fight but it cost him his life. However he was the lone death on CLG while almost all of C9 were killed. CLG rushed down middle lane to knock down a tower and two inhibitors and take control of the game. Darshan finished with the most deaths on CLG but a lot of those deaths came with kills or assists. He and CLG's split push strategy came up big this week against two very good teams and pushed them into second place in the standings.

Xmithie: Fed Darshan early and it paid off with victory

Name: Jake ""Xmithie"" Puchero

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Xmithie made multiple early ganks for Darshan to get him a lead in lane and make him a split pushing nuisance.

Analysis: Xmithie finished with a 2/4/14 KDA on Udyr in their win over C9. He camped Darshan's lane early to get him first blood and helped him get an advantage in lane which paid off. Darshan was able to split push and expose one of C9's inhibitors without any assistance. To go along with Darshan's split push, Xmithie bought a Zz'Rot Portal to help keep pressure on other lanes. C9 mounted a bit of a comeback and got a Baron Nashor buff late game but CLG was able to break up their siege and almost ace them. From the near ace CLG was able to pick up a tower and two inhibitors which put them in control for the rest of the game.

Huhi: Helped hold off Cloud9 while Darshan split pushed

Name: Choi ""Huhi"" Jae-hyun

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Huhi was able to help buy time for Darshan to split push and get Counter Logic Gaming get the win.

Analysis: Huhi finished with a 8/5/9 KDA on Corki in a win over C9 on Sunday. The laning phase was pretty even for Huhi in the mid lane and he stayed close in gold to Jensen for the entire game. He finished with the most damage dealt to champions in the game but dealing out all that damage put him in dangerous situations that cost him his life. C9 was making a comeback with a Baron Nashor buff but CLG was able to break up their siege and traded four kills for one death. Huhi was among the survivors and led his team to knock down a tower and two inhibitors which C9 wasn't able to come back from.

Stixxay: Large contributor in win over Cloud9

Name: Trevor ""Stixxay"" Hayes

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Stixxay's solid game against Cloud9 got a him 5/3/12 KDA on Ezreal and a win.

Analysis: Stixxay was close in lane despite being taken out in an early skirmish. He was a threat in team fights and dealt the second most damage to champions for CLG while finishing with the second highest kill participation. He and Darshan were killed late in the game which allowed C9 to get a Baron Nashor buff and attempt a comeback. However CLG was able to break the siege and trade one death for four kills. The favorable trade late game let Stixxay and his teammates push down a tower and two inhibitors and take back control of the game. Stixxay bounced back nicely after having a poor game on Saturday but his kills were still kind of low. They have slightly easier competition next week so he could easily have a more productive week stat wise.

Aphromoo: Came up big with Bard's ult late to break Baron empowered siege

Name: Zaqueri ""Aphromoo"" Black

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Aphromoo's helped break up Cloud9's come back late to get his team to a perfect 2 - 0 Week 7.

Analysis: Aphromoo finished with a 1/4/17 KDA on Bard in a win over C9 on sunday. His high number of deaths was easy to accept because he had the highest kill participation for CLG. However the game was very close and C9 was able to secure a Baron Nashor buff late game and began to siege CLG's base. Aphromoo helped his team break up the siege by initiating a fight with Bard's ult which locked down two members of C9. With the numbers advantage CLG was able to clean up the fight,only having to trade one death for four kills and take control of the game. Aphromoo's Bard ult came up big in that late fight and it helped CLG pull out a win over C9.

FEB. 27, 2016

Gate: Laning failure kill hope for crucial victory

Name: Wang ""Austin ""Gate"" Yu

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Gate fell victim to a poor early lane exchange, setting the stage both for his team's defeat to Team Liquid, as well as an abysmal 0/5/3 KDA for himself.

Analysis: Within five minutes of the game starting, everything had fallen apart for Team Impulse. In the top lane, Procxin has suicided and turned a won lane for Feng into a nightmare. Not even a minute later, Gate and Mash engaged Team Liquid's bot lane in a 2v2, a fight they theoretically should have been advantaged in. Nevertheless, Liquid found a way to not only come out on top, but to kill Gate outright, leaving Mash to fall further behind alone. That was just the tip of the iceberg, though, as not long after the first full 5v5 of the game was fought, a fight that saw nearly every member of Team Impulse fall, Gate included.

While Impulse made a few more attempts to pull the lost game back, their engages were mixed at best, with multiple players extending too far forward on a regular basis. To make things worse for Gate, each of these fights saw him perish, and with it any hope for a decent KDA. Unsurprisingly, it's hard to recommend a player who went 0/5/3 for fantasy, and both Gate and his struggling team should be treated as radioactive by any owners who like winning.

Mash: Poor lane performance buries team

Name: Brandon ""Mash"" Phan

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Mash and Gate found themselves outmatched by Team Liquid's lane, with Mash earning a mere 3/3/0 KDA before the dust settled on his team's swift defeat.

Analysis: Within five minutes of the game starting, everything had fallen apart for Team Impulse. In the top lane, Procxin has suicided and turned a won lane for Feng into a nightmare. Not even a minute later, Gate and Mash engaged Team Liquid's bot lane in a 2v2, a fight they theoretically should have been advantaged in. Nevertheless, Liquid found a way to not only come out on top, but to kill Gate outright, leaving Mash to fall further behind alone. That was just the tip of the iceberg, though, as not long after the first full 5v5 of the game was fought, a fight that saw nearly every member of Team Impulse fall, Mash included.

Needless to say, falling this far behind a team with Kog'Maw on it at this stage of the game was devastating, and despite a few attempts at engages Impulse never managed to get anything done, as Mash's damage simply couldn't compare to his opposite's. While his score overall was far from terrible, the bar is set much higher for ADC players in fantasy, and as such he is a palyer most would be best off avoiding.

Pirean: Unable to find time to make an impact

Name: Choi ""Pirean"" Jun-Sik

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Pirean found himself glued to his turret, eventually earning a 0/2/2 KDA in a brutal loss to Team Liquid.

Analysis: Picking Twisted Fate is always a gamble on the competitive stage. The strength of the champion comes from how he augments the power of the other lanes, as he constantly threatens a lopsided fight thanks to his ultimate. This power is not without it's costs, however, as in return his pressure in his own lane is minimal. FeniX wasted no time taking advantage of this fact, as he bullied and pressure Pirean all lane long.

To make matters worse, by the time Pirean had access to his ultimate his lanes had already fell far behind, and his attempts to assist them only deepened the hole the team had collectively dug themselves. Needless to say from his record, they didn't climb out, and fantasy owners would be wise to leave them there.

Procxin: Early game suicide paves the road for easy defeat

Name: Kim ""Procxin"" Seyoung

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Procxin got bit hard by his aggressive tendencies in his loss to Team Liquid Saturday, ending 0/4/2 by the end of the game.

Analysis: Procxin's early tower dive unto Lourlo is the stuff highlight reels are made of. Unfortunately, though, Procxin is the one who comes out looking silly, as he dies after greedily over-committing, more or less dooming his team in the early game singlehandedly. By the end of the game, though, one could almost feel sorry for the guy, as he dies trying to finish of a nearly dead Lourlo on three separate occasions, each time throwing an even or advantageous skirmish for TiP. The fact he managed to die as many times as Feng's Malphite, who started out the game in a terrible position thanks to Procxin's suicide, is a testament to his lack of caution. If he's to earn a spot on any fantasy owner's roster, he'll need to find a level of consistency that simply seems beyond him and his team at this point.

Feng: Fails to initiate advantageous fights in loss

Name: Wang ""Feng"" Xiao Feng

Team: Team Impulse

Update: Feng finished with a 1/4/1 KDA in a loss to Team Liquid on Saturday.

Analysis: TiP drafted a composition that was made to do one thing: dive and dive hard. Unfortunately, the key synergy they were relying on was between Feng and Gate, as Tempered Fate should have easily led into an excellent unstoppable force. Unfortunately, that never happened in this game, and to make it worse Feng found himself stuck in lane against a double buffed Nautilus after a disastrous gank by Procxin. Frankly, Feng and his team shouldn't be in consideration for any fantasy owners at this point in the split. The few games they've managed to win were miraculous and still lacked the scorelines that would make them look attractive.

Cabochard: Supportive role sets up clean Vitality win

Name: Lucas ""Cabochard"" Simon-Meslet

Team: Vitality

Update: Cabochard ended Friday with a 0/0/10 KDA on Nautilus.

Analysis: Another supportive performance from Cabochard, but one that worked out well for his team. He was able to farm well early against Steve keeping the Elements top laner from mindlessly pushing in the top lane. With help from Shook, Cabo set up two successful dives on Steve picking up two assists early in the game. In the mid game he was constantly pushing in the side lines to help Vitality control the map and used his hook and ultimate to set up kills in team fights.

Shook: Aggressive early game helps him control the tempo

Name: Ilyas ""Shook"" Hartsema

Team: Vitality

Update: Shook finished Day Fourteen of the EULCS with a 4/1/4 KDA as Nidalee.

Analysis: Shook set the tone early on in this game, farming well and successfully diving Steve in the top lane twice for quick kills. With KaSing, he set up vision in the Elements side of the map throughout the game, giving Vitality control over the map. He combined the vision game with control of objectives such as Dragon and Rift Herald, while helping to take down towers.

Nukeduck: Dominates on the wings of Quinn

Name: Erlend ""Nukeduck"" Holm

Team: Vitality

Update: Nukeduck finished Vitality's Friday win with a 6/0/4 KDA on Quinn.

Analysis: One of the few Quinn mid lane players, Nukeduck is making the champion his own across both LCS regions. He farmed well early, bullying Eika and not allowing his opponent to consistently wave clear. He solo killed Eika in the mid game and picked up a second kill minutes later after Vitality set up a gank in the mid lane. From there he looked to split push down towers, using his ultimate to soar around the map quickly. In the final team fight of the game he picked up three kills, leading to the end of the game for Vitality.

Hjarnan: Power spike helps Vitality to dominate win

Name: Peter ""Hjarnan"" Freyschuss

Team: Vitality

Update: Hjarnan was unkillable Friday, posting a 4/0/5 KDA on Corki.

Analysis: Hjarnan let a farm heavy early game lead him into a big mid game power spike allowing Vitality to dominate Elements. He didn't pick up his first kill until the 18th minute, but from there he dealt huge damage in team fights as Vitality put a stranglehold on the game. He both poked well as Vitality sieged towers with Baron buff and punished Elements with burst damage when they tried to team fight.

KaSing: Controls the vision game in win

Name: Raymond ""KaSing"" Tsang

Team: Vitality

Update: KaSing ended Day Fourteen of the EULCS with a 0/2/7 KDA on Tahm Kench.

Analysis: Despite giving away first blood, KaSing enjoyed a successful game on Tahm Kench. He controlled the vision game with Shook to allow Vitality tons of map control as they took over the game from Elements. The vision control allowed him to make plays including flanking well with his ultimate to set up kills. KaSing was also able to keep his allies safe in team fights by using Devour to shield them from damage as elements won the game.

Gilius: Kept in check by Vitality

Name: Berk ""Gilius"" Demir

Team: Elements

Update: Gilius ended Friday's loss to Vitality with a 0/3/3 KDA on Gragas.

Analysis: Gilius was really smothered in this one and struggled to make any plays throughout the game. He farmed well early and was able to pick up an assist on first blood. Unfortunately that was his only shining moment as Vitality dominated objectives and strangled the life out of Elements. Gilius couldn't really make anything happen as Vitality dominated the map and team fights.

Hauntzer: First blood not big enough of anchor to weigh him down

Name: Kevin ""Hauntzer"" Yarnell

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Hauntzer got caught out early, but that was his only death and finished with a 0/1/11 KDA on Nautilus.

Analysis: Early lane swaps got Hauntzer an early gold lead despite giving up first blood to Hard. Hauntzer roamed a lot of the game which helped TSM keep the pressure on Echo Fox. He always seemed to find the right place to be at the right time to help his team win fights and finished with 100 percent kill participation. His lack of kills was because of how his champion fit into TSM's team composition. Nautilus is a tanky front line champion that is a fight engager and mainly sets up kills for teammates instead of taking them. The kills will come back if Hauntzer begins to play hyper carries in the top lane instead of tanks.

Bjergsen: Anhilates second half of game, finishes with perfect KDA

Name: Soren ""Bjergsen"" Bjerg

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Bjergsen dominated the second half of the game and finished with a 5/0/6 KDA on Orianna.

Analysis: Bjergsen was quiet in the early game and kept even with Froggen in damage trades and CS. When the team fights broke out Bjergsen came alive and was TSM's main damage dealer. He landed Orianna's ult on multiple people during team fights which made it an easy clean up for TSM. Bjergsen was able to farm and become a beast late game thanks to the rest of TSM keeping pressure on Echo Fox.

Svenskeren: Tanks his way to victory

Name: Dennis ""Svenskeren"" Johnsen

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Svenskeren was Team SoloMid's main tank in victory over Echo Fox and finished with a 3/1/5 KDA on Elise.

Analysis: Svenskeren took the most damage on TSM despite there being an Alistar and Nautilus in the line up. Even though he took the most damage, he managed to only die once, and it was during the team fight over first dragon. Taking so much damage made him run early from a few fights and miss out on some assists, but he was still a damage threat and dealt out the second most damage on TSM and participated in all but three of TSM's kills.

Doublelift: Executed by tower, not Echo Fox

Name: Yiliang ""Doublelift"" Peng

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Doublelift's only death came when he walked into tower range before his minions, but otherwise he put together a solid 3/1/7 KDA on Kalista in a win over Echo Fox.

Analysis: TSM was better at rotating during the lane swaps to start the game, which gave Doublelift an early gold lead that he was able to slowly grow for the rest of the game. He didn't have to hard carry his team in fights and only dealt the third most damage to champions on TSM. He could have finished without any deaths, but he mistakenly walked into tower range before his minions and couldn't get out of range before the tower killed him. This is a silly mistake for a professional to make however it didn't hurt anything but his stats.

Yell0wStaR: No deaths and ties for most assists over Echo Fox

Name: Bora ""Yell0wStaR"" Kim

Team: Team SoloMid

Update: Yellowstar finished with a perfect KDA and 100 percent kill participation on Alistar in a win over Echo Fox.

Analysis: Yellowstar and Doublelift didn't have to deal with the traditional laning phase to start the game and took down their tower while Keith and Big took down top lane's. TSM were slightly ahead after the lane swap finished and then were able to keep the pressure on Echo Fox for the rest of the game. When team fighting began, Yellowstar earned assists by disrupting Echo Fox with head butts and pulverizes which earned him 100 percent kill participation.

KFO: Starves of CS early, can't rally late

Name: Park ""KFO"" Jeong-hun

Team: Echo Fox

Update: KFO made a sloppy lane swap, fell behind in gold early and couldn't come back. He finished with a 0/2/2 KDA on Malphite in a loss to Team SoloMid.

Analysis: KFO helped his team lane swap, but then was zoned off minion waves by Doublelift and Yellowstar which made him have a very slow start to the game. He got an assist on first blood when he helped Hard punish Hauntzer's over extension, however it wasn't enough to make up for his lack of CS. The constant pressure from TSM forced team fights that Echo Fox couldn't make the plays to win. KFO landed some good Malphite ults, but the rest of his team couldn't follow up on them, and TSM just keep pushing their way to victory.

Hard: Soaks up damage and kills in loss to Team SoloMid

Name: Anthony ""Hard"" Barkhovtsev

Team: Echo Fox

Update: Hard was a step behind in their loss to Team SoloMid and finished with a 2/2/0 KDA on Gragas.

Analysis: Hard was able draw first blood on Hauntzer, but it didn't make up for Echo Fox's early deficit. TSM dominated team fights, and Hard was forced to use Gragas' ult for a disengage instead of using it to try to pick someone off. He finished the game with all of Echo Fox's kills, which isn't wanted as his role should set up kills for his team instead of taking them. Hard did fulfill his role as tank though and finished with the most damage taken.

Froggen: Only close lane for Echo Fox, can't carry late

Name: Henrik ""Froggen"" Hansen

Team: Echo Fox

Update: Froggen picked Corki again but can't lead his team to victory and finished with a 0/2/1 KDA.

Analysis: Froggen tried to be the aggressor in lane but couldn't get an advantage over Bjergsen. They stayed pretty even in trades and CS, however Bjergsen made a bigger impact in team fights. Froggen wasn't able to get a good engage with his team and failed to win any team fights. TSM respected Corki's package and waited for Froggen to use it or for it to wear off before most of the team fights. While he was the lead damage dealer for Echo Fox, he couldn't get any kills. In past games Froggen had been able to get some early kills with Corki and win lane, but it didn't happen this time. He managed to keep lane close, but when all lanes lose on a team it is near impossible for them to win.

KEITH: Cannot overcome slow start

Name: Yuri ""KEITH"" Jew

Team: Echo Fox

Update: Keith fell behind early because of a sloppy lane swaps and finished with a poor KDA of 0/3/2 on Lucian.

Analysis: Keith was a superhero last week, but started off as a zero this week. He and Big were a step behind on lane swaps and started to fall behind early. In team fights, Keith was targeted early and taken down, which is why he finished with the most deaths on Echo Fox. The early setbacks also meant he was weak in team fights and couldn't deal out much damage before being taken down.

BIG: Failed in lane swap, can't help team late

Name: Terry ""BIG"" Chuong

Team: Echo Fox

Update: BIG fell behind early and couldn't rally with his team in the mid game and finished with a 0/2/2 KDA on Braum.

Analysis: BIG and Keith were slow to rotate to defend Doublelift and Yellowstar, ultimately falling behind early. When team fights were finally initiated in the mid game they weren't able to get a favorable engage on TSM and lost any chance of a comeback. It's really difficult for a support to put together good stats when his team loses and BIG is no exception. If Echo Fox wants a make a run in the playoffs they will need to learn to lane swap better.

Darshan: Split pushed to victory

Name: Darshan ""Darshan"" Upadhyaha

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Darshan got a lot of help from Xmithie to win his lane and split pushed his team to victory, finished with a 4/2/2 KDA on Fiora.

Analysis: Darshan got early ganks from Xmithie and started to build a gold lead in lane that he would keep for the rest of the game. The mid game had a lot of back-and-forth moments but CLG held on to a tower advantage and kept the pressure on IMT for the majority of the game. Darshan was able to split push with only Huni trying to stop him and it wasn't enough. So far Darshan is the only player to really take advantage of Huni's aggressive play and snowball a lead over him which might be the secret to defeating IMT.

Xmithie: Camped top lane early to keep Huni down

Name: Jake ""Xmithie"" Puchero

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Xmithie ganked Huni early and often to help feed Darshan and finished with a 2/1/4 KDA on Udyr.

Analysis: Xmithie spent the early game helping Darshan and it paid off later in the contest. He helped Darshan pick up a double kill on Huni and Reignover for first blood which led to Darshan winning his lane. Feeding Darshan early let him become the split pushing monster late game that brought IMT's win streak to an end. IMT had a chance to get their second Baron buff of the game and possibly stall the game to make a miraculous comeback, but Xmithie played the role of spoiler and stole the boost, sealing the victory for CLG.

Huhi: Strong mid game, falls off late

Name: Choi ""Huhi"" Jae-hyun

Team: Counter Logic Gaming

Update: Huhi capitalized on mistakes in the mid game which got him a 2/4/2 KDA on LeBlanc.

Analysis: Huhi stayed close in lane and had a strong mid game power spike but wasn't a big factor in the late game. He caught Wildturtle and Huni out of position for his only kills of the game. However, the tables turned late in the contest, as he was the one being caught out of position which allowed IMT to get a Baron Nashor buff and stall the game. He dealt the second most damage to champions on CLG but also had the most deaths. It",[]

(0:45)

Center Alex Mack has signed a five-year deal with the Atlanta Falcons, the team announced.

Editor's Picks McManamon: Losing culture likely led to Mack's exit Although the Browns were offering Alex Mack more money to stay, his decision to join the Falcons likely was impacted by the constant losing in Cleveland, Pat McManamon writes.

Falcons address one big need with center Alex Mack The Falcons expected signing of center Alex Mack should bring immediate stability and better blocking to the interior of their offensive line. 1 Related

In Atlanta, Mack will reunite with Kyle Shanahan, the Falcons' offensive coordinator who held the same position with the Browns before leaving the team in 2015.

Mack is the second major departure for the Browns in free agency as wide receiver Travis Benjamin has agreed to a contract with the San Diego Chargers.

Mack voided the final three years and $24 million remaining on his contract on March 2, becoming a free agent. The 30-year-old center had to make a decision on the opt-out by March 4.

He was a first-round pick by Cleveland in 2009. A three-team Pro Bowl selection, he is considered one of the NFL's top interior linemen.

""We knew we needed to add an established presence along our offensive line,"" general manager Thomas Dimitroff said in a press release. ""Alex is a three-time pro bowler and is an ideal scheme fit for our offense. We understand the importance of solidifying the center position and we have been able to do that today. We are pleased to be able to add Alex to our roster and believe he will be an anchor to our line.""

Mack secured a five-year, $42 million contract, which included $18 million guaranteed, from the Browns in 2014 after the club used the transition tag on him. Jacksonville signed Mack to an offer sheet, which the Browns matched.

Later Wednesday, the Falcons announced that they had also agreed to terms with QB Matt Schaub. Schaub was picked by the Falcons in the third round of the 2004 draft and has also played for the Houston Texans, Oakland Raiders and Baltimore Ravens.

Also, wide receiver Mohamed Sanu is headed to Atlanta for a free-agent visit on Thursday.

espn.com,,Doug Martin gets $35 million to stay with Tampa Bay Buccaneers,"['Michael Rothstein', 'Ben Goessling', 'Josh Weinfuss']","Mark Dominik explains what he saw in RB Doug Martin when he initially drafted him as GM of the Buccaneers, as well as how important it is for teams to re-sign their own players. (1:30)

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and running back Doug Martin have reached agreement on a multiyear contract, keeping him with the team.

Terms were not disclosed, but a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter that it's a five-year deal worth more than $35 million.

Editor's Picks Bucs wisely recognize re-signing Doug Martin was best option The Buccaneers did the right thing by re-signing Pro Bowl running back Doug Martin. They almost had no choice, as the list of free-agent backs wasn't impressive.

""Our top priority heading into this offseason was to ensure that Doug remained a Buccaneer and today we are excited to announce that he will,"" Buccaneers general manager Jason Licht said in a statement.

""Many of our offensive accomplishments last season can be attributed to the success of our running game with Doug in the backfield and we believe he is a perfect fit for our offensive system. It is always satisfying when you get the opportunity to reward one of your own players and Doug certainly has earned his place as one of our young foundational players.""

Martin, 27, is coming off a huge bounce-back season in which he finished second in the NFL in rushing (1,402 yards) and in yards after contact. He also caught 32 passes for 271 yards and scored seven touchdowns (six rushing) to make his second Pro Bowl.

But Martin's production has been up and down in his four NFL seasons -- either running for more than 1,400 yards (in his first and fourth) or fewer than 500 (in his second and third).

The Bucs took Martin with the 31st pick in 2012, and he finished his rookie season with 1,454 yards and 11 rushing touchdowns and caught 49 passes for 472 yards and one touchdown. The 1,926 yards from scrimmage were second in team history behind James Wilder (2,229 yards) and his rushing total set the franchise's single-season rookie mark.

Martin was a finalist for rookie of the year and earned a Pro Bowl berth as a first alternate.

He played in only six games in 2013 because of a torn labrum in his left shoulder, an injury that eventually landed him on injured reserve. He ran for 456 yards and one touchdown before the injury.

Martin missed five games in 2014 because of knee and ankle injuries and ran for only 494 yards and two touchdowns while sharing carries with Bobby Rainey and Charles Sims.

espn.com,,"Players fight to keep Marvel's ""Vs."" titles relevant","['James Obscurica', 'James Bates', 'Wynton Prog', 'Obscurica Chen', 'Stephen Chiu', 'Dan Szymborski', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Erzberger James', 'Tomi Lurppis', 'Timothy Lee']","Going into Winter Brawl X, fans of Capcom's ""Vs."" series had two questions:

What does it mean to be a ""dead"" game? What keeps people coming back to an aging title?

The action within the confines of the various competitions at Winter Brawl X were compelling in their own right, but there might be even more to learn from what happened when tournaments took a back seat to a couple of contests of sheer will and pride.

In the lifespan of competitive titles, a game usually hits a tipping point when new blood suddenly becomes hard to find. Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 has reached that point. There are several big factors in play. The game itself is difficult to track down for many aspiring players. Dedicated players are approaching five years of hardened practice -- and that's not even counting those who played the earlier iteration, Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds.

The game is long past its initial exploration phase, yet these players are still refining what they've been given. There are no patches on the horizon, there are no professional circuits on the rise, and viewership numbers have dwindled a bit.

For those concerned about the direction of the game, Saturday night may have been a hopeful glimpse into its future, courtesy of the game's older sibling. After tournament matches were finished for the day, tournament setups were converted to casual stations and center stage was held captive by a CRT and a Dreamcast. For those familiar with the players involved, as well as the venerated spot of the game, it is nothing but a continuation of the storied history of Marvel vs. Capcom 2, originally released in 2000.

When Desmond ""Xcutioner"" Pinkney sat down to play against Loren ""Fanatiq"" Riley, it wasn't the grand finals of any tournament -- it was a Saturday night dedicated to continuing a rivalry that's far from settled. ""Well, Desmond and Fanatiq had beef in the game since late 2008. They've played matches before, but nothing of this caliber ... it was supposed to happen back when the game was still relevant to the tournament circuit but they couldn't link up,"" Michael ""IFC Yipes"" Mendoza explained.

They finally did outside of Philadelphia, where a crowd got a glimpse of a recent past that many had never been exposed to. West Coast natives sat on the stage in front of an East Coast crowd that wanted to be certain that their house would be defended, the house microphone commandeered by Abraham ""GoldenboyNeo"" Sotelo. IFC Yipes continued, ""In terms of coastal rivalries, it was real deep back then [during the Marvel vs Capcom 2 era]. When we win or they win, it would take a while to see each other again, due to not having a million tournaments a year like how we do now. So every time we saw each other, we always tend to make it count.""

Marvel

They made it count long before character select finished loading. A few prideful words were exchanged on social media, coastal pride swelled up in players that weren't involved or had even played the game. When the set was concluding, Fanatiq behind in games, ten to fourteen, his Magneto and Storm had both been quelled. All that remained was his Psylocke, typically just an assist character, against the full roster from Xecutioner. Xecutioner extended his hand for the handshake, signaling an insurmountable lead, yet Fanatiq chose to keep fighting until Desmond finished Psylocke and the set.

It wasn't enough, but it signaled a mindset that seems to persist among some of Marvel vs. Capcom 2's finest: as long as I have something to prove in this game, I will play it. That mindset has led to the tradition and the history that separates it from many other games, including one trying to follow in its footsteps -- a game that would have its exhibition next, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.

Chile's Nicolas ""KaneBlueRiver"" Gonzalez was due to square off against NorCal's Ryan ""Filipino Champ"" Ramirez, and finally close the book on one of the most-viewed rivalries in not just Marvel, but fighting games at large.

Going into this heated matchup, Hayden ""Kinderparty"" Griswold, host of Marvel-oriented podcast ""Marvel Lives"", broke down the gravity of the set. ""People have a lot of assumptions about KaneBlueRiver vs Filipino Champ: how the set will play out, what the aftermath might be like, what this set means for the game of Marvel 3. The fact is, while we continue to speculate about this heavyweight match-up, the only thing that can be agreed upon is that this is a huge fight. It's good vs. evil, new vs. old, USA vs The World, and champion vs champion. KBR has taken a beating in the media leading up to this fight, and this is his chance to finally hit back. Will we see that from him? Will Hulk smash? I'm not sure, but I know as soon as I heard the match was announced, I bought my tickets.""

KaneBlueRiver, the EVO 2015 champion, shocked the world with his victory in Vegas. Did ""big body"" teams still have a place in the game? Sure, as long as human error exists. He had been traveling across the United States prior to the event, staying with people who would be his training partners, and KaneBlueRiver's victory at Evolution Championship Series was his first win at a major event --in a game that the United States dominated, no less. He had the run of his life, knocking off many of the scene's favorites on his way to the title.

Many took exception, including Filipino Champ. The EVO 2012 winner questioned whether or not KaneBlueRiver was a true champion. They were truly a study in contrasts. Filipino Champ's tenure as EVO Champion saw him continue to travel and battle against some of the finest in the scene, while KaneBlueRiver already had a trip to Japan planned afterwards and rarely appeared in the public eye. While Champ's stream often featured local players on the rise, KaneBlueRiver wished for a local scene that would help his own growth as a player -- especially as he struggled to string together wins back home.

""The struggles to find competition and tourney results were nothing new to me,"" said KaneBlueRiver. ""It's always like that when I'm going back home. If you can't sharpen a knife, it doesn't remain as it is, it gets duller. The only difference is that there was way more attention into that this time because I had won EVO. It's not that I don't have people to play back home, is that nobody cares about higher aspirations.""

The two crossed paths at SoCal Regionals in 2015, but no games were played. Social media barbs continued to be tossed, and things got personal on more than one occasion -- finally culminating on that stage. Filipino Champ may have had an edge heading into the meeting, with the mental warfare seemingly in his favor, but KaneBlueRiver took the exhibition to be a lesson, rather than a pulpit. It was far less of an exhibition and far more of an execution, as Filipino Champ didn't come to win, but rather, came to embarrass his opponent. He took the house mic to lambast his opponent, proclaim that this was his game, and on more than one occasion paused to give a mercy victory to his opponent.

Filipino Champ waves away KBR's offer to shake hands before their match at Winter Brawl X. Robert Paul

KaneBlueRiver occasionally changed teams, seeing what worked and what didn't, but took the opportunity for training. ""The exhibition was an opportunity to play a long set with one of the best players, which is something I never get, so I was aiming to learn as much as I could."" Just like the earlier exhibition, it was settled by a score of fifteen to ten -- but could have been far worse.

There might have been a deity out there that enjoys watching fighting games, as we were blessed with a rematch on Sunday in tournament play. After Champ dispatched KBR in the finals of Winners side 3-1, the two met again in the Grand Finals. KBR forced the bracket reset after winning a set of his own 3-2, and it had to come down to a final game. Fate sided with Chile that afternoon, and after the slaughter of the exhibition and all the trash talk that came with it, KaneBlueRiver was able to find redemption and take the tournament. EVO 2014 champion Justin Wong remarked on twitter after KaneBlueRiver's victory, ""This is why Marvel is at EVO.""

What keeps people competing in Marvel vs. Capcom 2?

""The pride of the game and the unfinished business, in terms of rivalries, is what keeps this game flowing,"" IFC Yipes explained. ""Marvel vs. Capcom 2 had lots of stories for over ten years; Ultimate is stagnant in that area, but it's starting to pick up!""

As players continue training for what some assume will be the last year the game is present at EVO, Winter Brawl only added more questions to the enigma of the future of the game. With the release of Street Fighter V, some veterans are returning to the title. Will theory teams like those from Vineeth ""Apologyman"" Meka reign supreme? As stock in New York City rises, thanks to players like Raynel ""RayRay"" Hidalgo and Amir ""Cosmos"" Adorno, can the former Mecca of Marvel reclaim its spot? Will the south be led by the gauntlet of Derrike ""Full Schedule"" Nunn or will character specialists like Kevin ""DualKevin"" Barrios stake their claim? Can arguably the most decorated player in the game's history, Christopher ""Chris G"" Gonzalez finally capture the one trophy that has been evading him?

Some of the same names from the Marvel vs. Capcom 2 community have carried that fire over to Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3.. Yipes has become the de facto voice of both communities. Goldenboy Neo is looking to finish better than his fifth place showing in 2015 in Vegas. Years ago, some questioned whether Daniel ""Clockwork"" Maniago was washed up as a player, but he's looking toward something more than ninth place. Justin Wong has high hopes in Street Fighter V, but his name is among the most heralded in Marvel; even as Filipino Champ logged a fifth place finish in SFV, his passion while playing against KBR and Cosmos was unmatched.

After his victory in July, KaneBlueRiver proclaimed that Marvel no longer belonged to America, it was the world's game, and the defending EVO champ certainly knows that the target on his back only grew larger with his victory in Philadelphia. Players from Mexico and Japan made huge strides last year, and American players are hoping to reclaim a series that they've claimed as their own for over a decade.

What does it mean to be champion in the realm of Marvel? Since last July, everyone has had an answer, but the debate still hasn't stopped. Is it the fighting champion who takes on all comers? Is it the one who is nearly unbeatable in long sets? Is it the one that survives the biggest shark tank of the year and hoists the EVO trophy?

Not even KaneBlueRiver has the answer. ""The only thing I can say is that I've seen people that are definitely champions in one way or another, and I know I'm very, very far from what they've been able to do.""

At the end of the Marvel vs. Capcom 2 exhibition, Xcutioner pointed out GoldenboyNeo, saying that he'd get the same treatment as Fanatiq one day. The pride is heavy in a game that is over a decade and a half. If the fires ignited through the first five years of Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 burn nearly as bright, we won't be surprised to see some of the stars of today square off a decade from now. For now, the journey continues as they continue down the inevitable road to Vegas.

Next stop? Atlanta for Final Round.

(1:00)

BRADENTON, Fla. -- The numbers that define Carlos Correa can't be calculated on your hard drive. Don't contain a single decimal point. Won't be found on any ""league leaders"" list.

That's because the two numbers that define the Houston Astros' mesmerizing young shortstop are No. 3 and No. 1.

No. 3? That's where he hits in the batting order -- for a team with win-the-World-Series aspirations. At 21 years old. Amazing.

And just wait until you hear the legendary names who have done that at his age. Even more amazing.

Then there's No. 1. That's the number he wears on his back. We'll let him tell you why he wears it in a minute. But to those of us who watch baseball closely, it feels like a number that sums up where this guy is heading someday. And soon.

If he isn't going to be the No. 1 player in this sport, he'll be part of that debate. Yeah, even in a world that has Mike Trout and Bryce Harper living, and playing baseball, in it.

Let's start here: At 21, Correa already has done something that had never been done. Last year, he became the first American League player to win a Rookie of the Year award after being selected with the first overall pick in any draft. (Only Harper, Darryl Strawberry and Bob Horner have ever done that in the National League, for that matter.)

But ask him if winning that award has changed his life, and Correa replies, as coolly as ever: ""It has changed. But it hasn't changed me.""

You don't meet many 21-year-olds who talk the way this guy talks, or glide around a diamond the way this guy does, or handle every traffic jam on baseball's highway with the ease and composure Carlos Correa seems to summon. But that, of course, is the essence of what has gotten him to this place.

""He kind of carries himself like he's been in the big leagues for 10 years,"" teammate Jake Marisnick says. ""He does everything the right way. It doesn't come off as a cockiness. It comes off as a confidence. That's a goal a lot of guys are trying to accomplish. But he's doing it at age 21.""

And that explains what he's doing hitting in the No. 3 hole for a team like this, even though, if we started compiling the names of all the people on earth who are older than he is, it would include ""old-timers"" ranging from Buddy Hield to Ariana Grande. But ""21"" isn't the only number that defines him. So let's play that numbers game. And how can we not start with ...

Number 3

Before we get into how Carlos Correa wound up in that No. 3 slot, let's put what it means to find him there in a little perspective.

Over the last 100 years, only three hitters have started at least 130 games in that 3-hole, in their age-22 season or younger, for a team that made the postseason. Those three would be (ready?) Cal Ripken Jr. (1983), Stan Musial (1943) and Joe DiMaggio (1936-37). More info is available on those three -- on their plaques in Cooperstown, N.Y.

But only one of those three guys was a full-time No. 3 hitter in his age-21 season, which Correa will be entering (even though he'll turn 22 in September). The only 21-year-old to do that? DiMaggio, in 1936.

Finally, even if we leave October out of the equation, only three other players in the live-ball era have started 130-plus games in the No. 3 spot for any team at age 21 or younger. That would be three more Hall of Famers: Ken Griffey Jr. (1991), Al Kaline (1955) and Eddie Mathews (1953).

So ... get the picture? We're talking about quite the star-studded group.

We run through some of those names with Correa, as the March sunshine pours down on him on a golden spring training morning. We ask what it means to hear his name on a list with names like those -- every one of whom went on to be an icon in this sport.

""It really means a lot,"" Correa says, earnestly as ever. ""Seriously. It's really humbling to be on that list.""

But it isn't as if Correa will be entering some sort of uncharted territory when he lands in the 3-hole on Opening Day -- because he has done it before. In fact, he was still only 20 when his manager, A.J. Hinch, first anointed him to hit there last June.

Correa then hit third for the next 79 games, plus five more in the postseason. During which he became only the third player to bat third in a postseason game at his age. The others: DiMaggio ... and Mickey Mantle. Does this dude hang out in some cool groups or what?

After two decades in the game as a player, manager and front-office executive, Hinch understands exactly how rare it is for any manager to build a lineup around a 21-year-old. He has done plenty of research of his own. He looked at Andrew McCutchen. And Justin Upton. And Bryce Harper. And Alex Rodriguez. Let's just say this isn't how they started.

""For the most part, they weren't thrust in the middle of the order,"" Hinch says. ""But for us, the situation called for it. And he could handle it.""

Select company Here is a list of the most games started by players batting third before their 22nd birthday in the live-ball era. Player Starts All-time Ken Griffey Jr. 230 Al Kaline 213 Eddie Mathews 204 Active Justin Upton 82 Carlos Correa 79 Bryce Harper 76 Miguel Cabrera 76 Source: Baseball-reference.com

The amusing part of that decision, though, is that, after doing all his research on other young stars, Hinch's full intent was to do the precise opposite. He was determined to take every step possible to turn down the heat all around his own phenom. And so, on the day the next face of the Astros arrived in the big leagues, Hinch called him into his office.

""I told him, 'Look, I'm going to take all the burden off of you,' "" Hinch reminisces now. ""I said, 'I'll hit you toward the bottom of the order for a good few weeks. We'll work you toward the middle of the order if you earn it.'

""And that,"" he says, laughing at the absurdity of it, ""lasted about three days.""

Yes, by his third game in the big leagues, Correa was already hitting fifth. And then second. And then, by the time his big-league career was three weeks old, he was the No. 3 hitter. Because of course he was.

""When I saw my name [third] in the lineup for the first time,"" Correa says, ""I was like, 'Whoa, Skip. Did you mess up something with the lineup?' But he trusted in me, and he hit me third. And I think it turned out pretty well, not only for me but for the team.""

So why did the manager make that U-turn as quickly as he did?

""It took me 72 hours to figure out he was a middle-of-the-order hitter,"" Hinch says. ""It was so funny. ... I told him, 'Remember what I told you in Chicago?' He said, 'Yeah.' I said, 'Forget everything I said. You're hitting in the middle of the order now.' He said, 'You've got it. Put me wherever you want.' ""

From the moment Correa stepped into a big-league batter's box, he just had that ""presence,"" Hinch says. And a ""command of the strike zone at an early age."" And an ""ability to hunt pitches to do damage on."" So what, the manager decided, was he waiting for?

""The moment was never too big for him,"" Hinch says. ""And the responsibility of hitting in the middle of the order, in the first couple of months of his career, never fazed him. So I saw no reason not to lean on him in that way.""

Notably, that word, ""responsibility,"" is one Correa has never tried to deflect. Did he know he was ready to hit third, so soon, for a first-place team? Of course not. But when his manager told him he was ready, ""I felt like he trusted me,"" Correa says. ""And it gave me the confidence to hit third.""

So now, as he prepares to do that for a full season, he has a chance to place himself in yet another special group. He has already started 79 games as a No. 3 hitter. And the Astros will play another 152 this season before Correa turns 22, on Sept. 22. So if he just stays healthy, and keeps on doing what he has been doing, he is likely to become only the second player in the live-ball era to start 220 games in the 3-hole before his 22nd birthday.

Who was the other? It was The Natural from a previous generation, Griffey. Who started 230. For the record, if Correa starts every game, he could actually reach 231. But we'll get back to you on that. In the meantime, we have one more number to talk about ...

Number 1

It's only a number. Only a number stitched into the back of his uniform. But it's not just any number. Not to Carlos Correa.

""To me,"" he says, ""it means a lot of things.""

""He kind of carries himself like he's been in the big leagues for 10 years. He does everything the right way. It doesn't come off as a cockiness. It comes off as a confidence. That's a goal a lot of guys are trying to accomplish. But he's doing it at age 21."" Jake Marisnick, Astros outfielder, on Correa

He was the No. 1 pick in the 2012 draft. It's about that. He was the first player from Puerto Rico selected with a No. 1 pick. It's about that, too.

""But the true meaning of it,"" Correa says, eloquently, ""is just working for more, striving for more, wanting to be one of the best out there.""

He began wearing No. 1 in the minor leagues. He always intended it to be more than simply another number on the scorecard.

""It was just a reminder,"" he says. ""Every time I walked to my locker, I see No. 1. Just to focus on what it takes to get there, to be one of the best guys out there. Every time I walk to my locker and look at my number, it reminded me of how hard I needed to work and all the effort that I had to put in to become one of the best players in the league.""

Well, if he isn't there yet, he's off to a historic start. His next game in the big leagues will be his 100th. But in the 99 he played last year, he served up 22 homers and 45 extra-base hits. Only five players that young in history ever hit that many home runs in their first 100 games. Yeah, five. And only three had more extra-base hits. Yeah, three.

Oh, and how many shortstops have ever matched or beaten those numbers in their first 100 games? Right you are. None.

So why are people starting to nudge Correa into the Trout/Harper pantheon? Um, that's why. And for the man in the middle of that discussion, that conversation is just one more motivation to get there. To be better. To play better. To do more. To win more.

""You know, those are things I visualized in the minor leagues,"" Correa says. ""I watched these guys play in the big leagues and I see how good they can play. And I visualize myself, with all the work I'm putting in, in that type of position. For people to say something like that, it really means a lot. It's really an honor.""

Yet what he talks about isn't what he has already done. It's what he still needs to do, because his story is just beginning.

""I feel I can run more,"" he says. ""I can steal more bases. I can play better defense. I can hit for a better average. So I feel like I can do everything better.""

But you know which word he mentions most? It isn't any of those words. And it isn't ""I"" or ""me."" That word would be ""win.""

""Sure, I have my own personal goals,"" he says. ""But it's about the team. And winning.""

Well, his team appears to be as ready to win as he is to ascend to whatever that next level is for onrushing 21-year-old superstars. But would we think the Astros were so ready if they weren't constructed around the kid with No. 1 on his back, hitting in that No. 3 hole?

""On this team,"" Hinch says, ""we welcome all kinds -- including 21-year-old guys making their debut in the middle of the order on a playoff-caliber team.""",[]

HEAVYWEIGHT DIVISION (UNLIMITED)

1. Tyson Fury (25-0)

England's Fury came into his mandatory shot against long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko on Klitschko's turf in Germany on Nov. 28. Owning a rare size advantage and a certain swagger about him, he pulled off a remarkable upset. Fury shut down the usually dominant Klitschko and ended his 912-year championship run to win the world title, although both guys performed poorly in a terrible fight. It was just that Fury was less bad than Klitschko, who quickly decided to exercise his right to an immediate rematch. They will meet again as soon as April but probably no later than June. Because Fury is bound to a rematch, he was stripped of one of the alphabet belts for declining to fight mandatory challenger Vyacheslav Glazkov.

Next: TBA vs. Klitschko

2. Wladimir Klitschko (64-4)

During his 912-year title reign -- second-longest in heavyweight history -- Klitschko successfully defended the title 18 times, third most in division history. He had an 1112-year undefeated run and won 22 fights in a row. But then he defended against Fury and showed virtually nothing, perhaps growing old before our eyes at age 39. He landed an abysmal 52 of 231 punches (23 percent) in their Nov. 28 fight in Germany and lost a clear decision in a terrible fight to a guy who didn't do all that much more than he did. But a loss is a loss and Klitschko's historic reign came to an ignominious end. He will look to start another one as he decided to go for the immediate rematch he had the contractual right to have.

Next: TBA vs. Fury

3. Alexander Povetkin (30-1)

Russia's Povetkin, a former secondary titleholder, is the mandatory challenger for titleholder Deontay Wilder (36-0) and was ringside in New York for Wilder's Jan.16 knockout victory as their sides held negotiations for the fight. They did not make a deal and it went to a purse bid, which Povetkin's side won with a surprisingly high bid of $7.15 million. The fight is due to take place by the end of May.

Next: TBA vs. Wilder

4. Deontay Wilder (36-0)

Wilder, the 2008 U.S. Olympic bronze medalist, fought a collection of has-beens and nobodies until facing a real opponent in Bermane Stiverne in January 2015. Wilder passed that test and won a world title by one-sided decision, and has since scored knockouts against three less-than-impressive challengers, Eric Molina, Frenchman Johann Duhaupas and Poland's Artur Szpilka, whom he erased in the ninth round with one shot on Jan. 16. Next up will be a mandatory defense against a legitimate opponent in Povetkin. Wilder could be headed to Russia for the fight since Povetkin's side surprisingly won the purse bid for $7.15 million.

Next: TBA vs. Povetkin

5. Luis Ortiz (25-0)

A 6-foot-4, 240-pound southpaw with raw power, Ortiz, a Cuban defector with tons of amateur experience, claimed vacant interim belt in October by blasting out no-hoper Matias Ariel Vidondo. That win did not prove much but Ortiz made a massive statement in his next fight that he is a force to be reckoned with when he put on an extremely impressive display en route to a crowd-pleasing seventh-round knockout of former title challenger Bryant Jennings on Dec. 19 in an HBO-televised main event. Finding an opponent willing to face ""The Real King Kong"" was difficult, but veteran former two-time title challenger Tony Thompson accepted the assignment for the HBO main event on March 5 and got knocked down three times and knocked out in the sixth round for his trouble. Golden Boy hopes Ortiz will return to fight May 7 on the Canelo Alvarez-Amir Khan HBO PPV card.

Next: TBA

6. Bermane Stiverne (25-2-1)

Stiverne's first title defense on Jan. 17 against mandatory challenger Wilder could not have gone worse, as he lost a wide unanimous decision and his title then spent two nights in a Las Vegas hospital being treated for severe dehydration. He passed on a return bout for an interim title against Ortiz on Oct. 17 on the Gennady Golovkin-David Lemieux HBO PPV undercard and instead returned Nov. 14 in an untelevised bout in which he got knocked down in the first round but won a tight decision against journeyman Derric Rossy.

Next: TBA

7. Kubrat Pulev (22-1)

Bulgaria's Pulev, a 2008 Olympian, got his mandatory title shot against Klitschko on Nov. 15, 2014, and got hammered. Pulev landed a couple of solid right hands, but Klitschko abused the challenger with left hooks, dropping him four times with that weapon in a brutal fifth-round knockout. Pulev made his ring return on Oct. 17 and pounded out an eight-round shutout victory against 41-year-old Argentine journeyman George Arias. On Dec.5, Pulev fought again and blew out journeyman Maurice Harris in the first round.

Next: TBA

8. Bryant Jennings (19-2)

Although Philadelphia's Jennings lost a lopsided decision to then-champion Klitschko on April 25, he had a couple of good moments in the bout and exceeded expectations by lasting the distance against an all-time great champion. Jennings returned on Dec. 19 to challenge Ortiz for his interim title in an HBO main event. It was a terrific action fight but Jennings could not handle Ortiz's power. He repeatedly hurt Jennings until finally knocking him down and stopping him in the seventh round.

Next: TBA

9. Lucas Browne (24-0)

Browne traveled to Russia for a mandatory shot at secondary titleholder Ruslan Chagaev on March 5 and despite being cut over his left eye and on his forehead, and suffering a hard knockdown in the sixth round, he rallied for a 10th-round knockout in an upset. The victory made him the first Australian fighter to win a heavyweight title. Next he is mandated to face former title challenger Fres Oquendo (37-8).

Next: TBA vs. Oquendo

10. Ruslan Chagaev (34-3-1)

After Uzbekistan native Chagaev blew away Francesco Pianeta in the first round to retain his secondary title in July, he was due to give Fres Oquendo a court-ordered rematch in October in Germany. However, Oquendo suffered a serious shoulder injury in training and the fight was canceled. With Oquendo out indefinitely, Chagaev faced Australian mandatory challenger Lucas ""Big Daddy"" Browne on March 5 in Russia. Chagaev dropped Browne, busted him up and was winning when Browne rallied for an upset 10th-round knockout.

espn.com,,2016 NFL free agency -- Haloti Ngata staying with Detroit Lions,"['Michael Rothstein', 'Ben Goessling']","The Detroit Lions are re-signing veteran defensive tackle Haloti Ngata, his agent said, bolstering the middle of their defensive line.

Financial terms of the two-year deal were not known, but Ngata is the second player the Lions have re-signed in the past few days. He joins fellow defensive tackle Tyrunn Walker, who re-signed Friday, as potential starters on the interior of the defensive line.

Editor's Picks Rothstein: Lions can still draft DT; Ngata can mentor Haloti Ngata is returning to the Lions, but this should not preclude the franchise from investing in a defensive tackle early in the draft. In fact, Ngata would be a good mentor for the rookie, Michael Rothstein writes.

Ngata has been one of the better interior defensive linemen in the NFL over the past decade. He's made five Pro Bowls, has been named first-team All-Pro twice and has helped the Baltimore Ravens win Super Bowl XLVII.

The former first-round pick out of Oregon spent the first nine seasons of his career with Baltimore, turning into a dominant force in the middle of John Harbaugh's defense. The Ravens traded him to the Lions minutes before free agency began in March 2015, after Detroit needed to find a replacement for Ndamukong Suh.

Detroit gave up two midround picks for Ngata in the hopes of solidifying the middle of the line. Then Ngata missed the majority of training camp and struggled early in the 2015 season. He also missed two games because of injury.

He played better in the second half of the season, showing more flashes of the force he was with the Ravens. He finished with 24 tackles and 2.5 sacks -- 14 tackles coming in the second half of the season. In all, the 32-year-old has played in 149 games, making 470 tackles with 28 sacks, six forced fumbles, five fumble recoveries and five interceptions.

Ngata and Walker join Caraun Reid and Gabe Wright as defensive tackles on Detroit's roster for the 2016 season. While the Walker and Ngata signings likely mean the franchise won't look at defensive tackles early in free agency, the franchise is expected to address the position early in the draft.",[]
espn.com,,10 key moments in the Williams sisters' 15-year saga at Indian Wells,[],"10 Key Moments In The Williams Sisters' 15-Year Saga At Indian Wells

ESPN senior writer Greg Garber discusses the impact of Serena and Venus Williams competing at the BNP Paribas Open.

This tangled story goes back 15 years, maybe even longer. It might have started in 1999, when Serena Williams beat Steffi Graf for the Indian Wells title, one great champion taking the mantle from another. Or maybe it started in 2001, with 18 ill-advised words from a 19-year-old Russian rival. The climax certainly came on March 17, 2001, when a crowd of nearly 16,000 turned on its former champion, her sister and her father. And now, at last, perhaps a final chapter of forgiveness. Venus Williams, following in her sister's footsteps, returns to Indian Wells this week for the first time in 15 years. What makes her appearance so important in the tennis world and beyond? Here are 10 key dates in the Williams sisters' Indian Wells saga.

A 20-year-old Venus Williams, the reigning Wimbledon, US Open and Olympic champion, beats Elena Dementieva 6-0 6-3 in the quarterfinals, setting up a showdown with her sister in the semifinals. During her postmatch interview, Dementieva, 19 and the silver medalist to gold medalist Venus at the 2000 Olympics, sets the stage with this comment when asked about the all-Williams semi: ""I don't know what Richard [Williams] thinks about it. I think he will decide who's going to win tomorrow.""

March 15, 2001

Four minutes before her semifinal against Serena was scheduled to start, Venus pulls out, citing tendinitis in her knee. ""The immediate supposition going around was that Richard made the decision,"" tennis fan Lee Parkinson, in attendance that day, told ESPN's Melissa Isaacson in 2015. ""He had made a lot of statements in the past about their draws, so people thought that was his statement -- that they shouldn't have to play one another before the finals and he was manipulating it. That's where the bad feelings came from."" Those bad feelings turned to boos. Lots of them. ""We were expecting them to walk out of the tunnel and we get that instead, and we were like 'What?'"" said Martha Church, who had flown in for the tournament from Oregon. ""We probably would've thrown things if we had it. It was a moment of having it sink in, like almost a moment of silence, and then the boos started.""

The final is set. It's Serena Williams vs. Kim Clijsters in a matchup of two of the WTA's most promising youngsters in the Indian Wells final. When Venus and Richard Williams walk down the aisle to take their seats, the crowd of 15,940 spews boos, prompting Richard to clench his fist at the masses. ""It has stood out in our minds ever since because it was such a shocking event,"" said Jerry Musgrove, at the match with her husband. ""We were terribly disappointed in the audience and don't want to be painted with the same brush. Our throats were sore trying to counteract their insensitivity."" Serena is the target throughout the match but still manages to win 4-6, 6-4, 6-2. Afterward when asked if she'd be back, Williams replied: ""I have a championship to defend next year. You'll probably see me here.""

March 26, 2001

In a USA Today story, Richard Williams revealed that on top of the boos there were also racist taunts and threats directed at him during the Indian Wells final. ""When Venus and I were walking down the stairs to our seats, people kept calling me 'n-----.' One said, 'I wish it was '75, we'd skin you alive.' ... I think Indian Wells disgraced America."" When asked later that day about her father's claim, Venus replied: ""I heard whatever he heard.""

March 28, 2001

And now for a do-over. Asked about her Indian Wells remarks regarding the Williams sisters and their dad and match fixing, Elena Dementieva said this: ""I was kidding.""

After 13 straight tournaments without a Williams sister in the draw -- interim champions included Kim Clijsters (twice), Maria Sharapova (twice) and Daniela Hantuchova (twice) -- at last a sign of hope. In an article written exclusively for Time magazine shortly after she won the Australian Open, Serena Williams announces that she's returning to Indian Wells for the first time since 2001. ""Throughout my whole career, integrity has been everything to me. It is also everything and more to Venus. The false allegations that our matches were fixed hurt, cut and ripped into us deeply. The undercurrent of racism was painful, confusing and unfair. In a game I loved with all my heart, at one of my most cherished tournaments, I suddenly felt unwelcome, alone and afraid. ... Indian Wells was a pivotal moment of my story, and I am a part of the tournament's story as well. Together we have a chance to write a different ending.""

In her first match at Indian Wells in 14 years, an emotional Serena Williams beats Monica Niculescu 7-5, 7-5. Venus Williams does not attend the match. ""I feel like I've already won this tournament,"" Serena said after her win and warm reception from the crowd. ""I don't feel like I have to actually hold the trophy at the end of this. I feel like I'm already holding up a trophy. I have never felt that way before. I feel like just being here is a huge win. Not only for me, but for so many people. It's a wonderful feeling.""

Citing a knee injury, Serena Williams withdraws before her semifinal against Simona Halep. She addressed the crowd on the court and posted this on Instagram: ""Though it ended early due to injury this year, I have to say I cannot wait to try again next year. Thanks everyone. I love you so much! ""

Tournament officials announce that Venus Williams, who had just suffered an early exit at the Australian Open, will play at Indian Wells, now known as the BNP Paribas Open, for the first time since 2001. ""We are thrilled that Venus Williams, one of the greatest women's players in the history of the game, is returning to play in the BNP Paribas Open,"" tournament CEO Raymond Moore said. ""Our fans embraced Serena last year, and we expect nothing less for Venus when she returns to compete at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden.""

March 1, 2016

In an article in The Players Tribune, Venus Williams wrote this about her return to Indian Wells: ""I remember the hurt I felt. I remember my confusion and disappointment and anger. I remember how the coverage of it at the time didn't seem concerned with me and Serena, as people, at all -- but rather only with the story itself. And with the version of the story that would get the most attention, regardless of the truth. I remember feeling that I had been wronged, and that I had done nothing wrong. I remember feeling that I had unfairly gotten the brunt of the blame for a bad situation. ... As the tournament draws nearer, I'm looking more and more forward to it. I'm looking forward to the amazing California grounds. I'm looking forward to the top-notch WTA competition. And I'm looking forward to the fans -- who played such an important role in helping to make last year so special.""",[]

The Norwegian finished runner-up to Marcel Hirscher in the next-to-last event, giving him an insurmountable 111-point lead over the Austrian going into the final race at St. Moritz, Switzerland, in two weeks.

""It's incredible,"" said Kristoffersen, who won six of nine slaloms this season. ""A race before the [World Cup] finals, that's like Hirscher-style. It's a dream come true.""

It's Kristoffersen's first crystal globe and the second slalom title for a Norwegian skier after Kjetil Andre Aamodt won it 16 years ago. Four-time overall champion Hirscher had won the title the past three seasons.

The 21-year-old Norwegian lived up to his billing as one of skiing's most promising slalom talents. He won Olympic bronze in Sochi in 2014 and captured the junior world title that same year and again in 2015. This season he raised his World Cup win total to 10.

""It was an unbelievable season,"" Kristoffersen said. ""Six wins, two times second, one time third, what's happening?""

Hirscher, who won the giant slalom title Saturday and has all but secured his fifth straight overall title, held on to his first-run lead to beat Kristoffersen in Sunday's race by 0.81 seconds. Stefano Gross of Italy finished 1.11 back in third.

Julien Lizeroux of France, who was second after the opening run, went out after straddling the first gate of his final run.

After three years of dominating the discipline, Hirscher was full of praise for Kristoffersen.

""You have to congratulate Henrik for an amazing season. He's a real and true champion,"" the Austrian said.

Coming into the race with a 131-point deficit, Hirscher said he wasn't thinking about his slim chance of retaining the title.

""It was just a lot of fun,"" he said. ""Most of the time I am thinking not to straddle and not to lose too much time because I need as many points as possible. But today it was just relaxed.""

It was the final race for 2006 Olympic silver medalist Reinfried Herbst, who is retiring at age 37. The Austrian won nine World Cup slaloms and took the discipline title in 2010.

De acuerdo al reporte del organismo con sede en la Ciudad de Mexico, Ryabinski gano, en Miami, con una oferta de 7.150 millones de dolares, mientras que DiBella ofrecio por la pelea hasta 5.101 millones de dolares, quedandose lejos de las cifras ganadoras que obligaran al campeon a ir a donde quiera el equipo del ruso.

El reporte senala que Ryabinski debera dar fecha y sede de la pelea en un plazo no mayor a 15 dias, y el combate no debera tardar mas de 90 dias en realizarse. El periodo de libres negociaciones culmino esta misma manana y no hubo senal de acuerdo entre campeon y retador mandatorio.

Wilder (36-0, 35 KO) viene de noquear a Artur Szpilka en enero pasado y aunque levanto la voz para enfrentarse al ingles Tyson Fury, primero debera hacer la cuarta exposicion de la faja que gano en enero de 2015 a Bermane Stiverne en su unico duelo que no termino por nocaut.

De ser asi, entonces estaran en juego 715 mil dolares en la pelea y de los 6.435 millones restantes corresponderan 4.504 millones a Wilder y 1.930 millones a Povetkin.",[]
espn.com,,Four moves I'd like to see happen before Opening Day,['Jim Bowden'],"Insider

Less than four weeks until Opening Day, a handful of contending teams still have holes to fill or upgrades to make, and there are a lot more players available than you might realize. Not just the few potentially impactful free agents left, but the Brewers are still listening to offers for former All-Star catcher Jonathan Lucroy, the Padres still need to trade hard-throwing starter Andrew Cashner before they get just draft-pick compensation at season's end, the Angels could use an upgrade in left field, and the Marlins need a veteran reliever to replace the injured Carter Capps.

So exactly how do these four teams address their needs? Here are some ideas:

1. The Diamondbacks trade for catcher Jonathan Lucroy

The Diamondbacks are primed to be serious contenders in the NL West after a whirlwind offseason that saw them land two top starters in Zack Greinke and Shelby Miller. The Diamondbacks seem pleased with their two catchers in Welington Castillo and Tuffy Gosewisch, but Lucroy and his .282/.340/.430 career slash line, gap power (13 homers and a major league-leading 53 doubles in '14) and elite game-calling skills makes him an inviting trade target. He'd be the perfect exclamation point for an offseason in which they loaded up to win now.

The Diamondbacks can offer the Brewers some combination of a power bat prospect in Peter O'Brien, third baseman Brandon Drury, left-handed pitcher Alex Young or outfielder Socrates Brito to make it happen.",[]

espn.com,,Nick Kyrgios hits back at Tomic in war of words,"['Niall Seewang', 'Greg Garber', 'Mark Hodgkinson', 'Nic Atkin', 'Peter Bodo', 'Pa Sport', 'Bonnie D', 'Espn Com', 'Espn Staff', 'Jim Caple']","Nick Kyrgios has hit back at Bernard Tomic as the fallout continues from Australia's fractious first-round exit from the Davis Cup.

First-year captain Lleyton Hewitt faces a far bigger battle than trying to keep Australia in the World Group as he bids to quell an escalating war of words between his top two players.

Australia will face a play-off later this year to stay in the top league after falling 3-1 to a John Isner-led United States in Melbourne.

The big-serving world No.11 fired 49 aces - including the third fastest recorded serve in history - to down Tomic 6-4 6-4 5-7 7-6 (7-4). It gave his team an unbeatable lead on the Kooyong grass before all hell broke loose in the Australian ranks on Sunday night.

Tomic, who said he was troubled by an ongoing wrist problem that would have forced him out of any event other than Davis Cup, accused Kyrgios of ""faking"" illness to skip the first-round tie in Melbourne.

""Two times. Two times he's faked it,"" Channel Seven cameras caught Tomic muttering to Hewitt during his loss to Isner. ""Two times Nick has faked it. Twice. While I'm here, Nick's sitting down in Canberra. Bullsh*t he's sick.""

Tomic didn't back away from his comments at the post-match press conference, questioning how Kyrgios could be fit to play in this week's ATP tournament in Indian Wells, California. The Australian No.1 said a similar situation happened last February when Kyrgios withdrew from the Davis Cup against the Czech Republic.

""He didn't come to Czech and had stress fractures and somehow played Indian Wells and felt good,"" Tomic said.

""He said he's `still sick but I'm going to be better tomorrow' - so it's just weird for me.

""If he plays Indian Wells, then he's definitely lost a little bit of my respect.""

Tomic said he spoke to Kyrgios after the match and the pair still had a good relationship.

""We're pretty open with each other and that's a good thing,"" he said. ""He's a good guy; he's got his own personality and I have mine.""

In response Kyrgios later taunted Tomic on Twitter, referencing the Queenslander's 6-0 6-1 loss to Jarkko Nieminen in Miami two years ago.

""Let's not forget who holds the quickest loss on the ATP Tour lol,"" Kyrgios posted. ""#howmanyminutesagain""

The tweet was later removed before Kyrgios followed up with:

Heat of the moment, not gonna take it personally. Indian wells a week away, plenty of time.  Nicholas Kyrgios (@NickKyrgios) March 6, 2016

But he then tweeted a more cutting:

Just don't expect me to have your back anytime soon.  Nicholas Kyrgios (@NickKyrgios) March 6, 2016

Earlier, Hewitt sat stony-faced while Tomic questioned the legitimacy of Kyrgios' commitment to Davis Cup.

While Tomic boasts a 16-4 win-loss record, Kyrgios hasn't won a rubber for Australia over the past two years. After missing last year's first-round win over the Czech Republic, he was dropped for the reverse singles against Kazakhstan after losing to lowly-ranked Aleksandr Nedovyesov on day one in Darwin.

Kyrgios was then omitted from the semi-final against Great Britain in Glasgow following a turbulent month in the US punctuated by his unsavoury sledging of French Open champion Stan Wawrinka.

Hewitt said he didn't doubt that Kyrgios was ill and he was ruled out by team's medical staff.

""Nick came down here and gave everything he had to try to be available and there's absolutely no doubt he was sick,"" Hewitt said.

He said Tomic's comments came in the heat of the moment and in frustration about his own injury.

Hewitt also showed his support for Tomic.

""Bernie's come here and he wasn't 100 per cent and he hasn't been for the last few weeks and he came out and gave absolutely 100 per cent in his matches here and did exactly what I asked him to do ever since he stepped off the plane,"" Hewitt said.",[]
espn.com,,St-Pierre: Comeback depends on 'a lot of things',"['Brett Okamoto', 'Eric Tamiso']","Former UFC welterweight champion Georges St-Pierre speaks with Todd Grisham about the chances he returns to the Octagon and what he thinks about Conor McGregor. (0:55)

LAS VEGAS -- Former UFC welterweight champion Georges St-Pierre's mere presence at UFC 196 on Saturday drew a lot of attention, but the 34-year-old said there is no update in terms of his long-awaited return to competition.

St-Pierre (25-2), who vacated the 170-pound championship in late 2013, told ESPN.com his comeback still depends on ""a lot of things."" Both he and UFC president Dana White did confirm, however, the two sides have been in discussion.

""The discussion is between myself and the UFC,"" St-Pierre said. ""They know the issues I had in the past and, yeah, we're talking. I can't say anything right now. There's nothing I can say about [UFC 200]. I don't have a name. I don't have anything.""

Rodolphe Beaulieu, St-Pierre's manager, added: ""There's no status. It's the same as it was two years ago. It's a big step to decide to come back. You have all that legacy, all those wins, sponsors and the good image. It's not an easy thing. I think athletes struggle to know when to stop. The UFC has not offered any fights, but they ask how he is, if he wants to come back. It's an ongoing discussion.""

One of St-Pierre's reasons for walking away from the sport when he did was the poor state of drug testing at that time. During his absence, the UFC launched a multi-million dollar partnership with United States Anti-Doping Agency to randomly test UFC-rostered athletes year-round. In 2016 alone, USADA has administered 335 total tests on 240 athletes, according to the organization's website.

When asked if he is completely satisfied with the program, the Canadian star's response was somewhat open-ended.

""It's better than it was before, but that discussion is also between the UFC and me right now,"" St-Pierre said.

""The system is good,"" Beaulieu elaborated. ""USADA is a critical agency that does the best thing and they have the capacity to do the best testing in the world, including the carbon-isotope ratio [CIR] -- but it's the discretion of doing the tests that is a concern. They have the discretion of when and whom to test. I have an athlete who wants to be tested 20 times in a year. Just because he wants that doesn't mean it will happen, because they have that discretion.""

St-Pierre, who won 12 welterweight title fights between 2006 and 2013, said he's in a better place mentally than where he was at the time he walked away. Several of those close to him have hinted at a potential comeback over the years, including head coach Firas Zahabi, boxing coach Freddie Roach and training partner Rory MacDonald. At least for now, St-Pierre maintains there is nothing to announce.

""Georges wanted to come to the fights tonight,"" said White on Saturday. ""Have we been talking to Georges? Yes, we have. But who knows. I honestly don't know right here, right now if Georges still wants to fight.""",[]
espn.com,,Reaction to Team Canada World Cup roster,['Pierre Lebrun'],"TORONTO -- Some quick thoughts on Team Canada's 16-player preliminary World Cup roster announced Wednesday:

GOALIES

Corey Crawford, Chicago Blackhawks

Braden Holtby, Washington Capitals

Carey Price, Montreal Canadiens

The skinny: These are the three goalies I had on my list last month when I last did my projected Team Canada roster, and I suspect these are the three choices from most people around the game. Price and Holtby were the automatic 1-2. Then management had to decide the No. 3 spot, and while Roberto Luongo and Marc-Andre Fleury deserved strong consideration, I think it's long overdue for Crawford to get his due on the big squad given his clutch, championship performances for the Blackhawks.

The real story here is that general manager Doug Armstrong and his management staff decided to fill all three goalie slots this early and not leave one spot open ahead of the June 1 final roster deadline.

I think the reason for this is Price's murky standing, as the reigning Hart and Vezina Trophy winner has missed most of the season with a suspected right knee injury. By naming both Holtby and Crawford now, Team Canada has both those guys mentally ready and focused with the assurance they're already on the team and, should Price withdraw at some point, there's no confusion what the 1-2 punch becomes: Holtby and Crawford followed by a new No. 3. So I think Armstrong wanted to clearly identify the hierarchy.

Smart.

Editor's Picks Burnside: It's hard to believe Phil Kessel is not on the roster Greater depth at forward and a substandard season have squeezed out Phil Kessel, a player who had been a go-to scorer for Team USA in the past.

Custance: Beware speedy Team North America at World Cup Team North America will go into the World Cup of Hockey with speed to burn and a surprising physical presence up front, which means the world hockey powers better not overlook it.

Burnside: Euros will need to come together in a hurry Lots of eyes will be on Team Euro to see how players from disparate countries adjust to being thrown together for one tournament. 2 Related

DEFENSEMEN

Drew Doughty, Los Angeles Kings

Duncan Keith, Chicago Blackhawks

Marc-Edouard Vlasic, San Jose Sharks

Shea Weber, Nashville Predators

The skinny: Also had all four of these guys in my group of seven last month. The story here, especially for Habs fans, is the exclusion -- at least at this point -- of P.K. Subban. But a little context here, folks. Team Canada felt the need to put two lefties with two righties as their top four for the preliminary roster, so that eliminated any chance Subban would make it this early. Doughty and Weber are untouchables on the right side. Period. Now moving forward it sets the stage for the incredible deep and competitive group of right-handed blueliners remaining to fight it out for the final one or two spots. They have Subban, Brent Seabrook, Brent Burns, Kris Letang and 2014 Olympic gold medalist Alex Pietrangelo still to pick from. I mean, it's crazy.

On the left side, I suppose some people will be surprised by Vlasic's inclusion this early in the process, but I don't see why. The 2014 Olympian is having a standout season once again for the Sharks. If he were playing in New York or Toronto, he'd be a way bigger name.

Those who remain on the radar for the one or two openings on the left on defense are the likes of Jay Bouwmeester, Mark Giordano, Jake Muzzin and T.J. Brodie.

Brodie is an interesting case because he's left-handed and plays the right side for the Calgary Flames. Perhaps the ideal candidate for the No. 7 job given that versatility. Although maybe they go with two more righties and one lefty. Tough choices.

There were plenty of easy decisions for Canada, such as naming Jonathan Toews, left, and Sidney Crosby to the team. JONATHAN NACKSTRAND/AFP/Getty Images

FORWARDS

Jamie Benn, Dallas Stars

Patrice Bergeron, Boston Bruins

Jeff Carter, Los Angeles Kings

Sidney Crosby, Pittsburgh Penguins

Ryan Getzlaf, Anaheim Ducks

Tyler Seguin, Dallas Stars

Steven Stamkos, Tampa Bay Lightning

John Tavares, New York Islanders

Jonathan Toews, Chicago Blackhawks

The skinny: The biggest surprise as far as omissions is Corey Perry, but he's surely going to be among the final four forwards selected by the June 1 deadline.

If anyone is surprised by Carter's inclusion this early, don't be. He was a two-way stud in Sochi and the Canadian brain trust has had him as a no-brainer from Day 1.

Getzlaf, meanwhile, worked his way back on this list of 16 after not being assured of it two months ago. He's been arguably the best center in the NHL over the past month.

So, taking into account that Perry is in for sure by June 1, that leaves three other roster spots, and I think the guys on the radar are Claude Giroux, Taylor Hall, Joe Thornton, Tyler Toffoli, Ryan O'Reilly, Brendan Gallagher, Mark Stone, Wayne Simmonds, Logan Couture, Brad Marchand and Matt Duchene.

Somehow they'll need to pick three names from that list. Good luck. Mercy.

Giroux was tremendous last spring at the world championships in Prague and is having another standout season. I'd like to see him picked because I also think his power-play prowess from the half wall would be key. Hall and Duchene would be my other two choices at this point. But can I also take Jumbo Thornton? Again, so hard.

As always, those final seven roster selections for Team Canada will generate passionate debate in the World Cup host country. I'm glad I'm not the one making those decisions. Now you know why Olympic Team Canada GM Steve Yzerman announced he was stepping down about half an hour after his team won gold in Sochi. Even in assembling back-to-back gold medal Olympic teams, the stress on Yzerman was through the roof. It's not a job for the weak of heart. Enjoy, Mr. Armstrong.",[]

Teixeira (24-4) will look to build on a two-fight win streak. The 36-year-old Brazilian is coming off a TKO finish over Patrick Cummins on Nov. 7. He fought Jon Jones for the UFC's 205-pound championship in April 2014, coming up short via unanimous decision.

Evans (19-4-1) is looking for his first win since a nearly two-year injury layoff that lasted from November 2013 to last October. A former champion, Evans suffered a decision loss to Ryan Bader at UFC 192. Also 36, Evans had been on a two-fight win streak before to the extended layoff.

This is the second time a fight between Evans and Rua has fallen apart. In 2011, Evans had earned a title shot against then-champion Rua at UFC 128, but wasn't able to accept due to an injury. His teammate at the time, Jones, accepted the bout and went on to become the most dominant champion in UFC light heavyweight history.

(1:31)

SURPRISE, Ariz. -- In what truly became a ""B'' game at spring training, a swarm of bees briefly delayed the Kansas City Royals' 3-2 win over the Colorado Rockies on Tuesday.

Edinson Volquez threw three hitless innings for the Royals, but the insects caused the biggest buzz. They sent Kansas City manager Ned Yost, members of his coaching staff and fans scurrying early in the exhibition matchup at Surprise Stadium. Yost and his coaches like to sit on folding chairs outside the dugout, and the bees caused them to duck for cover.

Yost said nobody got stung.

""They're not going to mess with you, just don't mess with them,"" Yost said. ""Kind of like the Royals. Don't mess with us, and we won't mess with you.''

The bees were removed in a plastic trash bag after the top of the third inning. Lowell Hutchinson, a retired beekeeper from St. Joseph, Missouri, came out of the stands to assist with gathering them. With the scarcity of honey bees, Yost implored that the bees be saved, not exterminated.

""I said, 'We ain't killing those bees. We better figure something out,'"" Yost said. ""Luckily, we had a beekeeper from St. Joe here. They had already devised that plan. Just put them in a plastic bag, take them out and let them go. We ain't killing them. There aren't enough bees in the world, boys. We can't be exterminating them.""

""They're so important to our environment. They pollinate everything. It doesn't make any sense to panic and kill bees when you don't have to. I am proud the way we handled it.""

""They're so important to our environment. They pollenate everything. It doesn't make any sense to panic and kill bees when you don't have to. I am proud the way we handled it."" Royals manager Ned Yost

Volquez said he saw Yost rush for the dugout while he was on the mound.

""I'm just glad to be alive,'' Volquez said with a laugh.

Bubba Starling, who hit a two-run, inside-the-park homer for the Royals, said the bees ""were crazy.""

""They were all over the place,"" he said. ""All the coaches came in until they got that taken care of. There was some actually down in the dugout. The majority of them were out in the on-deck circle.""

Rockies starter Jordan Lyles delayed warming up in the third inning when the bees were removed to a loud applause.

""That third inning, the umpires told me to hold off, that they were going to take the bees out,"" Lyles said. ""It didn't affect us on the field, but I'm sure the fans weren't too happy.""",[]
espn.com,,Broner: 'This fight isn't going four rounds',['Dan Rafael'],"Junior welterweight titleholder Adrien Broner has often called Floyd Mayweather his big brother.

Theyve had a close relationship in recent years, even though they have also had their differences from time to time. But Broner looks up to Mayweather, and the retired former pound-for-pound king has been a big Broner advocate.

However, they will be on opposite sides when Broner defends his 140-pound belt for the first time against Mayweather Promotions fighter Ashley Theophane in the main event of a Premier Boxing Champions card on April 1 (Spike, 9 p.m. ET) at the DC Armory in Washington.

""A lot of people told me I wouldn't be here. I come from nothing. Like cereal and water, nothing, Broner said at a news conference to promote the fight on Monday at a downtown Washington hotel. I'm very fortunate to have someone like Floyd to look up to. I don't want to be like Floyd though. I don't want to be like any man. I admire him and respect him, but I'm creating my legacy.

""At the end of the day, Floyd and Ashley aren't on my side. I'm against them. They're coming to dethrone me. They're my enemy right now and I'm going to beat Ashley down.

Broner (31-2, 23 KOs), 26, of Cincinnati, claimed a vacant junior welterweight belt by 12th-round knockout of Khabib Allakhverdiev on Oct. 3 in Cincinnati in a fight Broner dominated. He will be fighting in Washington, a city where often trains and calls a second home.

He said he intends to give a lights-out performance.

""This is really a big fight for me. I know that Ashley Theophane is going to come to fight, because he has something to prove, Broner said. He's going to try to take my world title. This training camp, I've really been perfecting my craft. This is going to be the best performance of my career. It's going to be a highlight-reel performance. I'm not coming to just get a win.

""This fight isn't going four rounds. That's too many. This is going to be quick. I'm not playing. There's nothing Floyd can teach [Theophane]. At the end of the day, it all goes out the window. The trainers and entourage can't help. They can't help Ashley Theophane. Big brother Floyd Mayweather is gone, everyone else is too boring, so I'm taking over the sport.""

Theophane (39-6-1, 11 KOs), 35, of England, is getting a title shot despite never having beaten a top opponent. His connection to Mayweather undoubtedly greased the wheels for him to get the shot.

""There are many different things we're working on to neutralize Broner and keep up with his quickness, Theophane said at the media conference. I've sparred with a lot of young guys who imitate him and I believe I can match him. He does a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. Adrien Broner can be beat and he has been. We're working hard. At the end of the day this is my career-defining fight.

""We all turn pro to become a world champion. I've been in the gym for months, working on things and staying in shape. I've watched Adrien Broner in the past. I was at the John Molina and Shawn Porter fights and I know he's got talent. But he can be beat. He's vulnerable, very vulnerable.

Theophane said he not only wants to win for himself but also for Mayweather to repay him for taking him under his wing.

""I'm representing Floyd Mayweather. He has my back and he believes in me, Theophane said. He believes I can win and that's extra motivation. It's been a long journey as a professional and I have to thank Floyd for giving me this chance.

Mayweather presided over the media conference and added, Adrien is a very young and explosive fighter. He's a force in boxing right now. Ashley Theophane is a guy that came from the U.K. with a dream. His dream was to be world champion one day. Same dream I had. He's a very humble, hungry and dedicated fighter.

I don't think this is going to be an easy fight for Adrien. I'll tell both guys to push themselves to the limit and give fans what they want to see.",[]

NBA prospect Ben Simmons has been included in an extended Australian men's basketball squad for this year's Olympic Games in Rio, despite uncertainty about his availability.

Boomers coach Andrej Lemanis on Monday named 26 players, including Simmons, seven NBA stars and 13 from the NBL, ahead of the team's one and only pre-Games camp in July.

Simmons, currently with Louisiana State University, is tipped to be the No.1 pick in the June NBA draft and it'll be up to his new team to decide whether to let him play in Rio.

Fellow NBA players Cameron Bairstow, Aron Baynes, Dante Exum and Joe Ingles are also in the mix.

""What we've done is ensured we have depth in all positions which will help us if injuries ever occur.""

The squad will be cut to 16 for the selection camp from July 5-10, once the Boomers' commitments in the NBA and Europe finish.

""The time frame dictates that we can only have one camp but it is the way it has been for years so it's not unusual,"" added Lemanis.

Of course, some things remain the same. Surely, you didn't think an off-afternoon in Los Angeles would change Steph Curry's status as the league's top dog?

Remember, this list is not about the MVP race, building a team, past accomplishments or future potential. It is about who is playing the best ball right now. So think back on the week's most impactful players, check out the rankings, and let the debate begin.

Note: MVP odds from Ladbrokes.com

1. Stephen Curry

Golden State Warriors

RPM: 10.12 (No. 1)

MVP betting odds: 1-100

Previous rank: No. 1

It would take nearly a month's worth of shoddy shooting and careless ballhandling to knock Steph from his perch atop the league, and true to form, he didn't let his cold streak last even two days. One night after he missed nine of 10 3s in a stunning loss to the Lakers, Curry found his touch and poured in 41 against Orlando -- and just to let you know he's not one-dimensional, he also grabbed 13 rebounds.

In fact, at 5.4 per game, Steph is fourth among all guards in rebounding. That's almost as impressive as his shooting stroke.

2. LeBron James

Cleveland Cavaliers

RPM: 8.74 (No. 5)

MVP odds: 30-1

Previous rank: No. 2

LeBron spent a sizable amount of time at power forward last week, as the Cavaliers effectively played small ball against Washington and Boston. That led to less ball domination -- which is nice -- without sacrificing James' scoring or assists.

As you might expect, King James was more active on the glass, as he averaged 11 boards in three games. Although the Cavs still show bouts of complacency (losing to banged up Memphis? Really?), their small-ball lineup can be formidable.

3. Kawhi Leonard

San Antonio Spurs

RPM: 9.62 (No. 2)

MVP odds: 18-1

Previous rank: No. 5

Leonard is taking over more and more for San Antonio, which -- combined with the Spurs' near Warriors-esque win total -- is why he has moved ahead of the two catalysts in OKC. He averaged more than 20 shots a game (and 24 points) last week. When was the last time the balanced Spurs had someone shoot that much?

All this shows how much the game's greatest coach trusts Leonard. Plus, his increased scoring, rebounding and passing haven't led to a decline on the other end. That being the case, we had to reward the league's quietest superstar with a leap up the rankings.

4. Kevin Durant

Oklahoma City Thunder

RPM: 6.31 (No. 8)

MVP odds: 20-1

Previous rank: No. 3

KD has been getting buckets, boards and even dimes galore, but his ball security has become shakier than a Beyonce video.

He averaged nearly seven turnovers last week, and in the Thunder's gut-wrenching loss to Golden State, he coughed the ball up four times in the decisive fourth quarter. That came a day after he gave it away three times in the fourth, which helped the Clippers rally from a 22-point deficit to upset OKC. It looks like he's trying to do too much.

5. Russell Westbrook

Oklahoma City Thunder

RPM: 9.11 (No. 3)

MVP odds: 28-1

Previous rank: No. 4

As is the case with his OKC partner, Westbrook's stats are eye-popping, all the way down to the errors. He has averaged nearly a triple-double over the past two months, but he has also racked up seven turnovers in three of the past five games, and his team is wallowing in underachievement.

Despite his huge assist numbers, Westbrook still is working to find the balance between setting up his teammates and going for his own. Key stat: The Thunder are 14-12 (.538) when Westbrook takes 20 or more shots but 29-8 (.783) when he shoots less.

6. Chris Paul

Los Angeles Clippers

RPM: 7.60 (No. 6)

MVP odds: 100-1

Previous rank: No. 6

That balance Westbrook is looking for? It can be found right here. Still the league's ultimate floor general, CP3 is inching closer and closer to knocking someone (hint: it's another point guard) out of the top five.

The hope is that he continues to seek his own offense when Blake Griffin returns. If so, perhaps the Clippers -- who have beaten both OKC and San Antonio since the All-Star break -- will emerge as true title contenders.

7. Damian Lillard

Portland Trail Blazers

RPM: 2.27 (No. 50)

MVP odds: 150-1

Previous rank: No. 7

It was a tough week for the Blazers, who dropped the last three games of a six-game road trip, but that was not because of Lillard. He put 50 points on Toronto's Kyle Lowry, one of the league's grittiest defensive point guards, and then 41 points and 11 assists on John Wall, as he went for 30 or more points for the eighth time in 11 games since All-Star Weekend.

Think about this: Wall hasn't been able to lead Washington to a playoff spot in the East. Without Durant for much of the past season, Westbrook failed to get OKC to the postseason. But Lillard has the post-LaMarcus Aldridge Blazers -- with guys named Vonleh, Aminu and Plumlee starting -- still firmly in the Western Conference playoffs, even with their recent skid.

8. James Harden

Houston Rockets

RPM: 5.24 (No. 12)

MVP odds: 40-1

Previous rank: No. 10

Yeah, I saw the comical video of Harden's defensive gems that's in heavy rotation on our Rockets' home page. But I also saw him rack up 40 points, 14 assists and just one turnover in a big-time victory at Toronto.

The bottom line is this dude's offense is so nasty -- scoring like Steph while dropping dimes like Rondo -- that you can live with his, uh, let's just call it what it is: horrific defense. After all, he's carrying an entire team on his back. Who else in Houston can create his own shot? The Beard moves up two spots from last week.

9. Kyle Lowry

Toronto Raptors

RPM: 7.36 (No. 6)

MVP odds: 150-1

Previous rank: No. 9

We recently saw how valuable Lowry is to Toronto, when his absence against Detroit led the Raptors to fall to the Pistons for the first time in three meetings this season. He is that rare point guard who plays tough, physical defense while also being a master thief (league-leading 2.2 steals per game).

What's more, his scoring and accuracy are improving by the month -- literally. He was better in January than in December, better in February than in January, and so far in March, he's averaging nearly 26 points on 58 percent shooting.

10. Anthony Davis

New Orleans Pelicans

RPM: 3.20 (No. 31)

MVP odds: 150-1

Previous rank: No. 8

A few players from opposing teams recently told me they're waiting for AD to develop that ""dawg'' in him. When he does, the inconsistency will vanish.

Look at the names above this one: They deliver big numbers every single night. Not AD. Not yet. There's a 12-point game here and a nine-point game there. Seven rebounds here and six there. But I have no doubt that he'll get there, and when he does, he'll move up the list.

The next 10

11. Paul George | SF | Indiana Pacers

Did I say last week that he had fallen too in love with the 3-ball? Well, lately, he has been on fire from beyond the arc, so fire away PG13 -- and switch places with Boogie from last week.

Previous rank: No. 12

12. DeMarcus Cousins | C | Sacramento Kings

We haven't seen numbers like his from the center position since Shaq left the Lakers. Of course, Shaq's totals led to wins. That's a big difference.

Previous rank: No. 11

13. John Wall | PG | Washington Wizards

Most of today's scoring point guards aren't near double figures in assists. Only two others score and assist on the same level as Wall, and they're both near the top of this list.

Previous rank: No. 13

14. LaMarcus Aldridge | PF | San Antonio Spurs

Like his teammate, Aldridge jumped two spots because he is replacing San Antonio's historic ""Big Three"" as the face and engine of the team.

Previous rank: No. 16

15. Dwyane Wade | SG | Miami Heat

D-Wade has provided the offense and the intangibles to lead the surging Heat in the absence of Chris Bosh. For that, I've promoted him two spots.

Previous rank: No. 17

16. Draymond Green | PF | Golden State Warriors

Mr. Versatile is impacting games with deft floor generalship, strong rebounding and staunch defense. But his scoring and field goal percentage are fading so much that I had to drop him a few pegs. Still, he was a beast for gutting it out through strep throat.

Previous rank: No. 14

17. Klay Thompson | SG | Golden State Warriors

He might very well be the second-best shooter in the league, but since early February, he has been cold from 3.

Previous rank: No. 15

18. DeAndre Jordan | C | Los Angeles Clippers

He showed Dallas what it's missing with a 23-point, 20-rebound masterpiece earlier this week.

Previous rank: No. 18

19. Hassan Whiteside | C | Miami Heat

Sure, he can be silly and lose focus, but my goodness, this dude is wrecking shop -- off the bench, no less. He's the lone newcomer to the top 20.

Previous rank: N/A

20. Pau Gasol | C | Chicago Bulls

Pau's doing whatever the Bulls need from him. He is the team's top assist man by a healthy margin over the past 10 games.

espn.com,,A guide to the most-watchable players in the NBA,"['Tim Macmahon', 'Anthony Olivieri', 'Dave Mcmenamin', 'Zach Lowe', 'Ian Begley', 'Justin Verrier']","It's time for an NBA dog days tradition: the Marc Gasol All-Stars, honoring my dozen favorite players to watch during this NBA season. Some ground rules:

* If possible, no actual All-Stars. Stephen Curry and Russell Westbrook are fun to watch. Duh.

* Ditto for the high-profile rookie phenoms we've been drooling over (or arguing about) all season; Kristaps Porzingis, Karl-Anthony Towns, D'Angelo Russell, Jahlil Okafor, Myles Turner and others need not apply.

* You have to be more than a bit player. Fun guys like Willie Cauley-Stein, JaMychal Green and longtime favorite Kyle O'Quinn haven't hit the undefined Gasol minutes threshold.

* We use an All-Star-style 12-man roster with a realistic mix of guards, wings and big men.

* No Warriors! Andre Iguodala is a natural for this, but we've all written plenty on Golden State, and we'll write plenty more.

Here are your 2015-16 Marc Gasol All-Stars:

STARTERS

Kemba Walker, G, Hornets (team captain): Walker's filthy, mean-spirited handle is even filthier now that he can shoot; fancy jitterbugging doesn't get you far if defenders duck under every screen. They can't do that as often with Walker hitting a career-best 37 percent from deep, and when opposing point guards chase him over picks, Walker is pulling up for Lillardian triples.

Walker might have the league's nastiest crossover, a low-to-the-ground left-to-right job that leaves saps lurching the wrong way on broken ankles. He'll fake toward a pick, coax his man that direction, and then zoom the other way into open water. Trap him on the pick-and-roll, and he'll scrunch down like a sprinter at the starting block before jetting through the crevice in between defenders.

Walker manages three direction changes in the time it takes most dudes to pull one, but when he sees a clear lane to pay dirt, he can hit the turbo button for a straight ahead bum-rush. The threat of that drive spooks defenders into backpedaling, and Walker exploits that with a deadly step-back jumper that covers so much ground that it's really more of a lunge-back shot.

He's shooting 60 percent near the basket, by far his career best, and he appears more comfortable kissing floaters off the glass. Walker has been a delight to watch for the scorching Hornets, and he might be the league's most fearless clutch shooter; no one has jacked more shots within the last three minutes of close games, per NBA.com, and Walker has canned a tidy 44 percent of those high-leverage looks.

Marcus Smart, G, Celtics: The guard version of Michael Kidd-Gilchrist -- a maniac who plays all out on both ends, defends inside your jersey and snags offensive rebounds few at his position are even allowed to pursue. Seriously: You had better box him out, even if he's 25 feet from the rim. Stand upright and he's either sprinting around you, or blasting you out of the way.

Smart has rebounded 4.7 percent of Boston's misses this season, the second-best mark among rotation players listed at 6-foot-4 or shorter, behind only the scowling blur known as Russell Westbrook. Smart is a master at sneaking in from the weakside corner for put-back jams, and he'll even fly in from someplace off your television screen to snare a Boston miss.

On defense, Smart is nearly impossible to screen on or off the ball, perhaps the most viscerally ferocious among a cadre of Boston perimeter defenders who can make it hard to throw one simple pass along the 3-point arc. The only way to pick Smart off: If he somehow doesn't see it coming and slams right into it. And since he plays at a million miles per hour, those collisions come with a loud thud.

Smart has added some needed subtlety to his pick-and-roll game, with change-of-pace dribbles in either direction and a floater he's lofting with more confidence. But he has struggled shooting from all over the floor, and he tries to finish in crowds at the rim instead of kicking the easy pass out to an open shooter. Smart isn't a point guard yet; he has logged just 94 minutes without one of Evan Turner and Isaiah Thomas to run the offense, per NBA Wowy.

But it's early, and Smart is proof that effort alone is entertaining.

Gordon Hayward, F, Jazz: Paul Millsap just appeared in his third All-Star game, so it's official: Hayward has seized the mantle of Most Underappreciated NBA Player. He does everything well, with the same combination of change-of-pace craft and straight-line explosiveness that makes Walker so magnetic -- only Hayward has perhaps the league's most stylish hair. Seriously, the guy is like a gelled-up, modernized Don Draper out there.

Any ball handler navigating the forest of Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors needs to squeeze through tight spaces and handle with enough guile to create space where none exists. Hayward can bounce it in either direction, and he has become an expert at scooting around a pick, pausing Chris Paul-style with a defender on his hip, and reading the floor with a live dribble until an anxious enemy commits one way or the other. Hayward in the that moment is a puppet master, the game in his hands, and when he sees an opening, boom, he strikes.

Utah's trees can obscure the path to the rim, so Hayward has developed a deep bag of midrange tricks -- step-backs, up-and-unders, and leaners where he's almost literally falling out of bounds. How many guys would even think to try this?

Hayward can manufacture a decent look from thin air, and that should serve him well as a crunch-time scorer. Utah has struggled in the clutch this season, but that has been due mostly to awful defense; Hayward is 13-of-28 on shots within the last three minutes of close games. When Rodney Hood and Favors are rolling, Hayward skulks around for scoring chances off the ball.

Jabari Parker, F, Bucks: Parker starting to get it -- at least on offense -- as some sort of positionless monster has been one of the stories of the last two months, even if it hasn't led to more wins for Milwaukee. Parker is flashing the mid-range touch everyone expected from the evolutionary Melo, and he even canned his first two triples of the season over the past week.

He has become so at ease with the ball that the Bucks are calling Parker-Miles Plumlee pick-and-rolls out of timeouts:

(Nice help defense, James Harden.)

He is a devastating open-court finisher, and over the past three weeks, Milwaukee's fast breaks have been a circus of alley-oops, no-look trickery and off-the-backboard passes. Parker is playing with a new calm in transition, searching out the simple passes:

And when Point Giannis (more on him later) has the controls, Parker morphs into one of the league's most dangerous baseline finishers:

Parker is one of those genius baseline tip-toers who leans and reaches out of bounds to extend the length of usable space on the court beyond 94 feet.

There is still a long way to go, especially on defense, where Parker is only beginning to get a clue. He's developing a back-to-the-basket game that would be useful when opponents can't scramble into the right matchups, and Parker finds a smaller guy on him.

But this dude is going to be something. Forget the notion that Milwaukee has been a disappointment this season. If the Bucks come out confident that they have two stars, everything else is noise.

Nikola Jokic, C, Nuggets: Do you like centers who run the break, shoot 3s and thread slick no-look passes all over the floor? You do? Then meet Nikola Jokic, the best rookie no one outside NBA Twitter knows about.

Only four bigs have assisted on a higher percentage of their teams' baskets this season: Joakim Noah, Blake Griffin and the Gasol brothers. The Nuggets use Jokic as a facilitator from the elbows, and they've featured him as the connector in some of the same lob sets the Bulls call for Pau Gasol:

He's shooting 52 percent overall and 36 percent from deep, with an All-Star-level Player Efficiency Rating -- a statistical profile that, at just 21, has resulted in Denver's broadcast team making the unfortunate, predictable comparisons with Dirk Nowitzki. Please, stop doing this with every good Euro prospect.

Jokic is more of a bruiser than Nowitzki, anyway. He's shooting 47 percent on soft-touch post-up shots he launches with either hand, and he fights hard for position on both ends. He can dive to the rim or spring for 3s after setting a screen, which allows Mike Malone to play him alongside almost any sort of big man partner.

He's not a great defender, but he's long, tough and smart -- ahead of the curve for a typical young center. Jokic isn't a leaper, so he gets his shot blocked a lot, and he'll probably never be a great rim protector. But he's solid, already, on both ends.

RESERVES

C.J. McCollum, G, Trail Blazers: The NBA's Dean Malenko: a man of 1,000 moves. Some guys have a magic crossover, in-and-out dribble, hesitation move or up-and-under around the rim. McCollum has all those at expert level, and he uses them to unleash hell from everywhere. He has shot better on off-the-bounce 3s than Damian Lillard. He's a floater master. And he's one of those lucky guys who can drive at full speed, hit the brakes and set his feet for a perfect straight up-and-down pull-up jumper.

McCollum has only hit about half his shots around the hoop this season, but he scores major style points for the way he contorts his body for a ridiculous array of scoop shots.

He's an intuitive mover within Terry Stotts' motion offense. He knows what the defense expects on this pitch play with Lillard, veers against that grain, and sprints at full speed even after he gets rid of the ball. Pause to catch your breath, and McCollum's gone:

Patrick Beverley, G, Rockets: Amid the Rockets' puzzling chemistry issues and horrid effort, there is Beverley, playing as if nothing has changed in Houston since last season. He's irritating opposing point guards, canning 40 percent of his 3s and working as an underutilized secondary attacker off the dribble.

When Harden sucks the defense away from Beverley and kicks him the ball, Beverley has a nice pump-and-go game; he can drive for soft runners or knife into the paint, draw another help defender and sling the ball across the court to the next open Rocket in the chain. Houston is most effective when it strings two or three of those sequences together, instead of watching Harden dribble away the shot clock and wing grenades to teammates who have no choice but to launch.

Beverley is a cagey offensive rebounder with free reign to slither in for second chances.

But let's get real: His chest-to-chest defense is the main draw. Beverley's battles simmer with the possibility of physical confrontation. He might annoy some fans, but it's hard to look away.

Aaron Gordon, F, Magic: On the right nights, Gordon is the most electric nonsuperstar in the NBA -- an unmatched brew of bouncy athleticism and earnest, gleeful effort. Those dunk-contest hops translate into noisy putback crams and flying ninja closeouts where Gordon emerges from off camera to swat a jump-shooter who had no idea Gordon was even nearby.

The finer skills are coming, and that's what makes Gordon exciting. Jumping novelties don't make it in the NBA. Power forwards who can fake, drive and pass like this do:

Gordon on that play creeps with an almost artificial slowness, as if he understands his body moves faster than his mind when he really lets it fly. You sometimes see the opposite happen, too: Gordon will streak down the floor, leap from the foul line as if he's in a dunking exhibition, and meet a defender in midair without a plan. He's like a superhero learning to harness his powers in the first 30 minutes of the movie.

I can't wait to watch the rest, especially since Gordon is jacking 3s without hesitation lately.

Jerami Grant, F, 76ers: The angriest, most violent player in the NBA. Grant doesn't just block shots; he swings so hard, it's like he's trying to deflate the ball, or smash a hole in the floor. When he whiffed on Friday against Miami, he smacked Amar'e Stoudemire's head on the follow through with such force, he drew blood.

It's the same for Grant on offense as a pseudo-stretch power forward: If he doesn't have enough space to chuck a triple, he's off on a zigzaggy drive that will probably end in a fierce dunk attempt. He wants to dunk everything, even if he can't quite reach the rim. And those 3s are scary too. Grant is down to a ghastly 21 percent from deep, and some of those misses are the all-backboard type that will fly downward and hit you flush in the face if you're not ready to rebound.

It's unclear whether Grant will ever shoot well enough to be a rotation guy on a real team, but you can see what Philly is thinking. Grant can defend at least three positions -- he was Philly's go-to defender against Dwyane Wade for much of their weekend series against Miami, despite playing at power forward -- and he has a fast-twitch energy.

Boris Diaw, F, Spurs: I feel like every other ""10 Things"" has some spicy Diaw action, so let's keep this brief: Boris Diaw is an international treasure. No one plays quite like him. No player makes me giggle at the television more often.

Thaddeus Young, F, Nets: Young is one of the league's wackiest shot makers, tossing in junk balls from that in-between space all those hip 3-point-shooting power forwards have abandoned. Some players need space to shoot. Young doesn't. He just needs time, and he buys it with dancing footwork bopping just a hair off the NBA's usual rhythms.

It doesn't matter if defenders are jersey-to-jersey with Young as he spins into his lefty jump hook; he releases the ball with his body turned away from the rim -- and almost before he even starts his jump. The funky timing throws defenders off; by the time they leap to contest the shot, it's already swishing through the net. Young creates separation on the vertical plane -- in the air -- instead of on the horizontal plane, where we normally imagine spacing. The ball's up, and you're down.

Young has hit 51 percent of his shots from the post this season, one of the best marks in the league, per Synergy Sports, and a preposterous number for a guy who doesn't look like a post scorer.

On the pick-and-roll, he no longer pops for 3s, and he can't really dive to the rim with Brook Lopez eating up space there. Young drifts into open space near the foul line and plops in soft little floaters. And sometimes, he just does goofy stuff, all his limbs flailing in the wrong directions, only for the ball to go in:

Ricky Rubio, G, Timberwolves: I accidentally spoiled this last week in reporting on Rubio-centric trade talks between Minnesota and Milwaukee. Like Young, Rubio's game unfolds at a pace just a bit off from normal NBA point guard play -- a dissonance that wrong-foots defenses and gives his teammates a precious extra bit of time and space to attack. He makes the same pick-and-roll reads as every other high-level point guard, only he makes them earlier, so that the ball arrives at its destination sooner.

Some of that is natural basketball genius. Perhaps some of it comes from Rubio's reluctance to score, and wavering faith in his jump shot. And that's part of the appeal here, too: Every game, and every Minnesota possession, is a mini-referendum on whether a point guard who can't shoot might still lead an efficient NBA offense in the pace-and-space era.

Bonus points for the consistency of Rubio's beard game, and for being one of the world's last real no-look passers.

10 THINGS I LIKE AND DON'T LIKE

1. Point Giannis

Oh my god. I'm not sure what's even going on here, but I like it. In the opening stretch of last week's win over Minnesota, the Wolves assigned Rubio to guard Giannis Antetokounmpo -- probably to keep Rubio's basic defensive job the same -- while the Bucks had Antetokounmpo defending Towns on the other end. What do you even label a player who defends the opposing center and then runs the offense against the other team's point guard? A ... freak?

All that positional confusion and cross-matching pays dividends: Opposing defenders can't find their matchups in transition, leaving Milwaukee with mismatches all over the floor.

Teams will slip under picks against Antetokounmpo, giving him space to shoot, but he's starting to find ways around that, including via instant re-screens going the other direction:

He already knows basic point guard reads, and when Jason Kidd wants to keep things simple, he can have Antetokounmpo attack one-on-one. Is a smaller guy on you? Post up! Is the opposing power forward on you, as often happens when Kidd removes Parker and pairs Antetokounmpo with just one big man? Then catch the ball at the elbow and blow by that sucker!

Funny thing about the Bucks: For all the fretting about their allegedly fatal lack of shooting, they've been a league-average offensive team most of the season, and their core lineups -- including one group Kidd called ""unplayable"" two months ago -- have been much better than that. They cut, screen and drive their way to enough buckets.

It's unclear where the Point Giannis experiment goes from here, especially since it marginalizes two high-profile acquisitions in Michael Carter-Williams and Greg Monroe. But Kidd kicked off the experiment ahead of schedule, and Antetokounmpo is thriving.

2. ""Wall Star""

This is a rice cake-level dull nickname for John Wall, and it makes me sad that he wears a diamond and gold medallion bearing it. Wall is a unique player -- a human fast break with an underrated eye for artful passes that zip one step ahead of rotating defenses. He can generate a corner 3 almost at will. He deserves a nickname that evokes what makes him special.

3. The Pau Gasol-Jimmy Butler connection -- with shooting!

Chicago has been tearing up defenses all season with variations of this play, which starts with a Butler ball screen designed to draw his defender out toward the perimeter -- and free Butler for a rim run after the Bulls' point guard touches a pass to Gasol.

Teams who see this coming, especially out of timeouts, might have Gasol's man sag down to cut off the lob pass, but that's a tough read in real time. Defenses by reflex send help from the weak side, and the Bulls turn that into a fatal proposition by stationing two shooters -- Nikola Mirotic and a surging Doug McDermott -- over there, as they did in Saturday's win over the typically lackluster Rockets:

Chemistry issues have swirled around Chicago -- and Butler -- all season, but Butler and Gasol have a fun mind meld on this play.

4. Michael Beasley, never changing

Four of Beasley's first five shots as a Rocket were long 2s, and the fifth was a twirling fadeaway after the Rockets recovered a Beasley jumper that drew all backboard. On his second shot, Beasley caught a dish from Harden, passed up an open 3-pointer, took one dribble inside the arc and hoisted a contested 20-footer. You be you, Mike.

It might be time to stop slobbering every time an NBA ex-pat scores 60 points in the Chinese league.

5. Nick Young, never changing

It might be time for Nick Young's NBA career to die:

6. Derrick Favors, fast and balanced

The sports-science experts at P3 in Santa Barbara have told me Favors is the most explosive NBA big man they've ever tested -- a rare mix of speed, size and force. As Favors' masters the nuances of NBA defense, he can do even more with that raw ability. There aren't many behemoths who can shut down a drive on the pick-and-roll, recover out to a popping big man in time to snuff an open jumper, change directions on a dime and track that big man's foray to the basket:

Tyler Zeller isn't the quickest cat, but that combination of wheels and body control is impressive.

7. ""WHICH WAY DID HE GO?""

I love when Fred McLeod and Austin Carr, Cleveland's homerific broadcast duo, get giddy about some crazy Cavs highlight. I can't help it. Among my favorites: when Kyrie Irving jukes some poor defender out of his shoes and blazes to the hoop as McLeod screams, ""Which way did he go???!!""

I can only hope it's an homage to a classic Tex Avery cartoon.

8. The Shane Larkin-Brook Lopez chemistry

Don't tell anyone, but the Nets have almost been watchable over the past two weeks! The Joe Johnson buyout cleared time for a revived and confident Markel Brown. Chris McCullough is finally healthy, Thomas Robinson jumps a lot. And Shane Larkin jets around like Sonic the Hedgehog off the bench.

Larkin and Lopez have developed the most random two-man chemistry since Shaun Livingston and Luke Walton made the give-and-go sing for an otherwise forgettable post-LeBron Cleveland team:

Lopez would be justified hunting shots for an aimless bunch, but he has doubled his assist average in making a real effort to get other guys going.

9. Shots of Joel Embiid practicing

Do Sixers fans still find these breathless montages of Embiid warming up intriguing, or have we reached the point where it's a cruel tease -- where you just want to see the dude play? Hoops Twitter overflowed with hope after Embiid busted out a between-the-legs dunk before a game last March; he's since undergone another foot surgery, jet-setted to Qatar for mysterious treatments and continued to not play competitive basketball.

I got as caught up in that dunk as almost anyone, and I'm so chastened, I look away from the TV whenever the Philly broadcast shows new Embiid warm-up footage. Wake me up when he plays.

10. Alex Len and Tyson Chandler, less together

There will be nights, including Sunday against the brick-throwing Grizzlies, where the Len-Chandler double-barreled center works well enough for the Suns to win, especially when they get a nutty 3-point barrage from Ronnie Price. Len's scoring binge on the block as a No. 1 option has been refreshing after injuries and team melodrama hijacked his first three seasons. Both Len and Chandler have useful midrange jumpers, and they can beat up smaller guys on the offensive glass.

But starting two 7-footers who belong in the paint is a great way to lose basketball games -- especially since Chandler is a rim runner who can't snag pick-and-roll lobs when the lane is overcluttered:

The Suns have scored just 92 points per possessions when Len and Chandler share the floor, way worse than Philly's cellar-dwelling offense. and their defense hasn't been much better; Chandler can't chase stretch power forwards 30 feet from the hoop. Just start one of Mirza Teletovic and Jon Leuer, even if it makes Chandler feel bad -- just as long as you do not play Teletovic at small forward.",[]

espn.com,,Notes From The Yardage Book -- Precursor to Snake Pit could portend Valspar champion,"['Ben Fawkes', 'Gordon Simpson', 'Kevin Maguire', 'Pa Sport', 'Espn Staff', 'Jason Sobel', 'Dottie Pepper', 'Bob Harig', 'Michael Collins', 'Sam Bruce']","This week at the Valspar Championship on the Copperhead Course, everyone will be talking about ""The Snake Pit"" -- holes 16, 17 and 18. In reality, a more critical hole comes a bit earlier, and it's one of the easier ones. How the eventual winner plays the short, 380-yard, par-4 12th on the weekend will set the tone for how they finish.

The reason it's key is because you must be very conscious of club selection for both the tee shot and second shot. Looking at the hole map, you can see most of the field can't hit driver since the fairway runs out at 260 yards at its farthest point.

The smartest players will sting an iron around 240-245 yards trying to get just past the sprinkler head that's 129 yards to the front edge. Remember, wind direction and firmness of the fairway will be a big factor.

What's important next is that little +2 you see by the yardages. That means your second shot is going to play two yards uphill.

Doesn't seem like much ... until you account for the wind! Wind, plus uphill, can be one to two clubs difference at this hole.

Now take a close look at the green. Notice the angle it sits at compared to the fairway. Any misjudged club selection will end up in one of those sand traps, the worst being the back bunker because of the slope of the green (back to front).

Trust me when I tell you that a shot from the front bunker to a front pin is about as easy as third-year trigonometry.

Watch how the leaders play this hole Saturday and Sunday. If any of them make a bogey here, you shouldn't bet on them winning the tournament.

After colliding in a classic championship game, Alabama and Clemson head into the offseason as the favorites to win the 2017 national championship.

The Westgate SuperBook installed Alabama as a 6-1 favorite to win the national title, followed by Clemson and Oklahoma at 7-1. William Hill's Nevada sportsbook has Clemson as the favorite at 6-1, with Alabama and Oklahoma right behind the Tigers.

Alabama knocked off Clemson 45-40 in a thriller Monday night in the College Football Playoff National Championship presented by AT&T in Glendale, Arizona. But the Crimson Tide are expected to lose a lot of the cast that contributed to that victory, including quarterback Jake Coker and possibly also running back Derrick Henry, the Heisman Trophy winner, who is expected to turn pro. Alabama opens next season against USC in Arlington, Texas.

The Odds Are In Their Favor Here's a look at the 10 teams with the best odds to win the 2017 national championship, according to the Westgate SuperBook. Odds Alabama 6/1 Clemson 7/1 Oklahoma 7/1 Ohio State 10/1 Baylor 12/1 Florida State 15/1 LSU 15/1 Michigan 15/1 Notre Dame 15/1 Tennessee 15/1 -- Westgate SuperBook

Clemson, on the other hand, could return as many as 17 starters, including electric quarterback Deshaun Watson, a Heisman finalist, who threw four touchdown passes against Alabama. The Tigers open next season at Auburn.

The Sooners, who lost to Clemson in a playoff semifinal, are the only other team with single-digit odds at the SuperBook. Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield returns, but the Sooners lose some key elements on defense and face a challenging nonconference schedule featuring games against Houston and Ohio State.

The Buckeyes are listed at 10-1 and Baylor is 12-1. Notre Dame, Florida State, Tennessee, LSU and Michigan are all 15-1.

espn.com,,Buck Showalter not panicking after Baltimore Orioles drop another,['Eddie Matz'],"SARASOTA, Fla. -- On the one hand, it's only spring training. On the other hand, after Monday's 3-0 loss to Minnesota, the Baltimore Orioles still haven't won a game and have been outscored by 34 runs.

It's easy to write off Grapefruit League losses. Starting pitchers sometimes treat their early outings like laboratory experiments, tinkering with secondary or even tertiary pitches that they may have little to no intention of using once the regular season begins. Road game lineups are often littered with minor league players, while big league vets tend to stay back at headquarters and work out, especially early in the schedule.

Ubaldo Jimenez rebounded from a dreadful debut to throw three scoreless innings on Monday, but the Orioles still lost 3-0 to the Twins. Jonathan Dyer/USA TODAY Sports

But when neither of those factors are in play and the losses still keep coming, what then? When the starting pitcher throws three scoreless innings and the home team's lineup has a regular-season feel -- both of which were the case for the Orioles on Monday -- and the end result still doesn't change, what's a manager to do? If you're Buck Showalter, you focus on the positive.

Like Ubaldo Jimenez rebounding from an abysmal debut. ""If he's carrying a good fastball that early in the year, that's a good sign,"" Showalter said of Jimenez, who followed up his rocky debut last week (6 runs in &frac13; IP) by giving up one hit in three scoreless frames against the Twins. In the process, he shaved a zero off his Grapefruit League ERA, lowering it from 162.00 to 16.20.

Like Hyun Soo Kim hitting the ball hard twice. ""There's a lot of time,"" Showalter said of Kim, the free-agent outfielder who hit .326 in Korea last year, but who is now 0-for-18 in his first major league spring training. ""He'll get it going.""

Like Rule 5 outfielder Joey Rickard teaming with Jonathan Schoop and Matt Wieters to nab Darin Mastroianni at home plate in the eighth inning. ""That's not an easy play,"" Showalter said, ""but they made it look smooth.""

Of course, there were also negatives. Like the Orioles scratching out just six base knocks against six different Minnesota pitchers. Like the offense going hitless with runners in scoring position. Like Hunter Harvey and Mychal Givens combining to issue four walks in two innings of relief.

And like the Orioles dropping to 0-7-1.

Although it's not something Showalter specifically addressed during his seven-minute postgame chat with the media, you have to think it's starting to weigh on him a little bit.

#AskESPNCaddie Have a question for ESPN.com's Michael Collins? The former PGA Tour caddie will answer your questions weekly. Just ask them on Twitter using #AskESPNCaddie. Follow @ESPNGolf 

Hanging out this week at Doral and getting a free shave isn't a bad gig if you have to work somewhere! I'm including a question that came in late last week because it's so good. As usual, there's an eclectic mix of questions, which proves that golf is not just about one or two topics. Enjoy this week's #AskESPNCaddie!

@ESPNCaddie where do you put clubs that are broken in the bag and has any player used a ""half club"" after snapping one? #askespncaddie  Stay Gold (@Navyjacket) February 27, 2016

Collins: Most caddies will try and put the pieces in the bag so the head can be re-shafted the next week on the tour trucks. But two extremes can happen, and I've been there when both occur (most caddies have). First, a player can be so mad at the club, it's either in the trash or leaving with an ecstatic fan. The second thing is a member of his ""entourage"" takes the club pieces. A phone call is then made to the manufacturer for a replacement.

@ESPNCaddie Ryder Cup chances for the US over the next 5 competitions? Can we go 3-2?#AskESPNCaddie  SS (@sgsmith00) February 27, 2016

Collins: That would be a great record. I think 2-3 is a more realistic goal since there are still kinks to work out with the new system in place. I think we win this year, but in 2018, I think we lose on the road again. After that, who knows what young talent emerges for both sides?

@ESPNCaddie what's the worst town on tour for excitement #askespncaddie  TJ Neeme (@HashtagTJNeeme) March 3, 2016

Collins: It's a no-brainer. White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia. The Greenbrier Classic is played in a place 20 miles past where they probably filmed ""Children of the Corn""! The resort itself is a stunning place, but leaving the resort to find something ""exciting"" might involve cow tipping.

@ESPNCaddie #AskESPNCaddie best tour stop for food! #talktomegoose  The_Kong (@FTKong) March 3, 2016

Collins: New Orleans and the Zurich Classic. It's still the only place I'll eat crawfish and oysters. The city has a vibe that gets in your soul, and the food matches it. If someone offered you coffee and beignets outside New Orleans, you'd be justified in declining. I will say I disqualify Las Vegas because there's no real ""local"" food in Vegas. Even if I included Vegas, it would still finish in second place.

#AskESPNCaddie What Rookie PGA Player would you most like to LOOP for ? @StevenTHogan  Steven T. HOgan (@StevenTHogan) March 3, 2016

Collins: Harold Varner III, but not for the reason most people would assume. I honestly could care less about the color of his skin. What I like is the game he posseses and the fight he has inside. I think our personalities on the course would mesh well. Y'all have to understand I'm a bit different when I caddie than when you see me at a tournament doing this gig. But I think Varner has the deepest pool of untapped potential.

espn.com,,Clay Buchholz roughed up in spring-training debut for Boston Red Sox,['Scott Lauber'],"FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Clay Buchholz has spent most of the past decade in the big leagues. And for most of the past decade, he has come to spring training and repeated some variation of the same line as it relates to his goals for the upcoming season.

""Staying healthy,"" he said Sunday, ""is probably the biggest one.""

Here's the problem: Buchholz rarely makes it through a season healthy. The Boston Red Sox right-hander has missed at least three weeks, often longer, in each of the past six seasons. You can almost mark your calendar by it. If it's June or early July, Buchholz must be on the disabled list, a status he has occupied before the All-Star break every year since 2010.

Clay Buchholz, the Boston Red Sox right-hander, started off his spring debut giving up three hits and three walks in 1 1/3 innings on Sunday. Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports

Last season, it was July 10 when Buchholz trudged off the mound at Fenway Park with a strained elbow. He didn't appear in another game until Sunday in an otherwise uneventful exhibition against the Baltimore Orioles' stand-ins at JetBlue Park and, well, it didn't go very smoothly.

Buchholz faced 11 batters, none of whom were named Manny Machado, Adam Jones, Chris Davis, Matt Wieters or J.J. Hardy. But seven of those no-name batters in the lineup reached base on three hits, three walks and an error by Red Sox shortstop Xander Bogaerts, which opened the door for three unearned runs.

Of the 42 pitches Buchholz threw, only 20 were strikes. He was lifted with one out in the second inning, having reached his pitch limit for his first spring outing.

But hey, at least he didn't get hurt.

""It felt like that was the first time out there in eight months or so,"" Buchholz said during the Red Sox's 8-7 victory. ""Get the first one out of the way and then, in five days, do it again.""

Wash, rinse, repeat.

At least Buchholz no longer must bear the burden of being the closest thing the Sox have to a No. 1 starter. That was the case last year. In the absence of a proven ace, Buchholz was the Opening Day starter and the leader of a rotation that had such a miserable April that pitching coach Juan Nieves was fired at the beginning of May.

But even though the Red Sox righted that wrong with the $217 million addition of David Price, Buchholz's importance shouldn't be diminished.

The club wasted little time exercising Buchholz's $13.5 million option when the offseason began. And in December, manager John Farrell pointed to the 31-year-old as a candidate to throw 200 innings, a prospect that made even the most optimistic fans double over with laughter but nevertheless was a sign of how much the Sox are counting on him.

Throughout his career, Buchholz has had stretches in which he has pitched as well as anyone in the majors. He was 9-0 with a 1.71 ERA through his first 12 starts of 2013, a stretch that was nearly duplicated over 11 starts last season when he posted a 2.17 ERA.

But then, inevitably, injury strikes.

By now, Buchholz must be tired of the constant focus on his health. A list of his assorted injuries -- left hamstring strain in 2010, stress fracture of his lower back in 2011, esophagitis in 2012, a neck strain in 2013, a hyperextended left knee in 2014 and the elbow issue last season -- reads more like the script from an old episode of ""ER.""

""Over the last 9-10 years, I've found a way to not listen to [criticism] or worry about it,"" Buchholz said. ""It's one of those things that, whenever you get hurt, it stinks to sit on the bench and watch your team go through bad stretches, go through good stretches. You want to be a part of it.""

In his latest attempt to ward off more physical problems, Buchholz altered his offseason routine. He concentrated on doing more repetitions with heavier weights in an attempt to add more muscle to his string-bean frame. The Red Sox list him at 6-foot-3, 190 pounds.

""I feel better with that added weight now because I added it early in the offseason and it wasn't something that was new whenever I got here,"" Buchholz said. ""Moving around and stuff, that's what I struggled with a couple years ago when I came into camp a little heavier. I just felt heavy on my feet and didn't feel very agile or athletic, but now I feel as normal as I ever have.

""If I make my starts on the day that my name is called, that will basically take care of all the numbers talk and innings and whatever you want to talk about from there. I feel like we already have a good club without me, but if I'm out there and I'm healthy and I'm throwing the ball well, I know that makes this team that much better.""",[]

espn.com,,Buffalo Sabres' Evander Kane knows only his actions matter,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Dan Marrazza', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Sean Allen', 'John Buccigross', 'Sarah Goldstein', 'Scott Burnside', 'Paul Grant']","The Sabres overcome a two-goal deficit in the third period en route to picking up a 4-3 shootout victory over the Maple Leafs. (1:12)

TORONTO -- Zach Bogosian has known Evander Kane since Day 1 of the winger's NHL career. Both were drafted by the Atlanta Thrashers one year apart, they moved to Winnipeg via relocation and were traded together to Buffalo.

In short, no other current or former teammate is in a better position to assess the sometimes controversial Kane after eight seasons together.

And what Bogosian, 25, points to is that behind the bright lights persona and the tweets and the social media image, there's a player that cares about his craft.

""I think if you look at his work ethic, and if you got to know him, the other stuff that maybe comes out about him, you would probably have a little different outlook on him as a person and a player,"" Bogosian said Monday before the Buffalo Sabres beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-3 in overtime.

""He has that persona that people like to dis on social media or anywhere, whether it's verbally attacking him or whatever, but if you get to know him, he's a good person. He works hard and that's one thing I'm sure a lot of people don't know about him. People see the flash and the bright lights, but if you really got to know him, he wants to win, he wants to score, he wants to work hard. You're kind of looking at two different ends of the spectrum as far as the way he's perceived in a media way, a social media way, and as far as how hard he works.""

Those who know Evander Kane say the perception of him in the media is very different from who he is as a person. Norm Hall/NHLI via Getty Images

There was Kane on Sunday in Buffalo, the first on the ice working on his shot ahead of an optional team practice. And looking at him off the ice, you can tell the man takes cares of his body.

But if he's going to win over his critics, he has to be on the straight and narrow for a long time. Last month's NBA All-Star Game flap in which his much publicized partying in Toronto and subsequent practice no-show earned him a one-game suspension from the Sabres, the scorn of some fans and the disappointment of an organization that gambled so much in trading for him a year ago.

""Like we said before, we were disappointed in some of the things that happened, it's on him to show us that he's making improvement and he's shown that,"" veteran Sabres captain Brian Gionta -- he of the Lou Lamoriello-New Jersey Devils mold -- said Monday of Kane's recent misstep.

Kane also made headlines in late December for a sexual assault allegation, which the player strongly denied and which still has not led to any charges.

As for Kane, he sounded contrite after the NBA All-Star brain cramp. But he knows his words won't matter, only his actions will.

""That was all on me, that was my fault. It's my responsibility,"" Kane said in an interview with ESPN.com Monday. ""I messed up. And what I said was true, it's not going to happen again. I know it's about me going out and walking the walk. That's what I've tried to do since that incident and that's what I'm going to try to do.""

Kane is a polarizing figure, I mean, just look at his dramatic exit out of Winnipeg. His lack of maturity at times mixed with playing in a fishbowl in Winnipeg was not a good combination.

But I also know this is a league where some people get uncomfortable when a player isn't your boring, cookie-cutter sort we're so used to, a player with personality and the audacity to be different.

Now, with maturity you hope that the 24-year-old Kane will know when to pick his spots.

The other aspect is that if he was piling up more goals on the ice, there would be a lot less scrutiny of the other stuff.

Kane is on pace for 24 goals this season, not the 30- or 35-goal season many, including himself, anticipated. He's missed nine of the teams' 67 games, to be fair, and in fact over 82 games his 19 goals in 56 games would be a 28-goal pace. And certainly it's harder to score now in this league than it's been in 10 years.

But still, even Kane himself wants to see more.

""If I buried 20 more percent of the chances I had this year, I might be sitting around with 28 goals. That's frustrating,"" Kane said Monday morning before scoring his 19th goal of the season that night. ""But at the same time, it is hard to score in this league. You look at a lot of guys around the league who have scored big in the past, there's maybe one 50-goal scorer a season now. It's hard to score. But you have to find ways to produce.

""I have games left, though. Lots of time left, both as an individual and as a team you want to finish off strong. That's my focus.""

Sabres head coach Dan Bylsma, in his Monday morning scrum with media at Air Canada Centre, was asked about Kane producing more goals and gave a rather detailed answer.

""I think you look at where he's going to get goals from, and how he's going to get those goals, for Evander to reach the 30-goal mark, he's going to get six to nine goals on the inside.""' Bylsma said.

""He's proficient and effective coming down the wing, moving and getting his shot off, he's excellent there. He's gotten six goals around the net this year. I think in order to get to that next level goal mark, 30-goal mark or 35, got to be getting on the inside where he can find the middle of the ice, get a pass from his winger or centerman and get another eight there.""

His 19th goal came right from the blue paint, Kane converting a nice cross-crease pass from Sam Reinhart into an empty net.

Back on Jan. 10, Kane's first game back in Winnipeg since last season's trade, provided a pivotal moment.

Kane hadn't scored in seven games and was staring at an empty net late in the game. Instead of shooting, he dished it over to Reinhart so the kid could get his third goal and first career hat trick.

It's a moment I think was well-appreciated in the Sabres dressing room.

I think I caught Kane off-guard somewhat when I asked him this final question Monday: How does he want people to remember him as a player once his career is over?

A little early, I know, to be thinking post-career, but I was curious to see what Kane would say.

""I haven't been in the playoffs yet in the NHL, but I want to be remembered as a winner, a guy who wins,"" responded Kane. ""I want to be known as a good teammate, a good guy, that gave back to the community in the towns he played in. That's something I do even though I don't look for the publicity.

""Obviously I also want to remembered as a player who could put the puck in the net, too,"" he added with a smile. ""But definitely want to be remembered as a winner. I've won at every level up until the NHL. So I want to change that narrative in the NHL.""

He's got ample time left in his career to deliver just that imprint.",[]

Even though Seth Greenberg thinks Texas Tech is in the NCAA tournament, he believes the Red Raiders have the most on the line Wednesday because they don't want a bad loss in the first round of the Big 12 tournament. (1:02)

If you're waiting around for the Big Dance next week to get involved in college basketball, you've already missed a lot of March Madness.

While the vast majority of recreational college basketball bettors don't get serious until Selection Sunday, sharp bettors have already been firing away because they know some of the best wagering opportunities of the year happen during the conference basketball tournaments in the two weeks prior to the Big Dance.

Many wiseguys prefer this fortnight because while there are just 67 NCAA tournament games over four weeks, every conference has a tournament (except for the Ivy League, which crowned Yale as its regular-season champ and winner of the NCAA bid). There are more than 300 games over these two weeks. That means more opportunities to find mispriced games by the oddsmakers, since they have to put up lines on every game and teams are playing back-to-back days as long as they survive, leaving very little time for oddsmakers to adjust their power ratings.

We've already seen eight No. 1 seeds get knocked out of their conference tournaments. One of those was Wichita State, which was ousted from the Missouri Valley Conference tourney last week by Northern Iowa. ESPN's Joe Lunardi and other experts still have Wichita State making the NCAA field, but it takes away one of the at-large bids. Valparaiso is another No. 1 seed (Horizon League) that lost Monday to Green Bay but should still make the field. There seems to be more debate about whether Monmouth, the MAAC regular-season champ and No. 1 tourney seed, will still get in after losing the title game to Iona on Monday night.

The good news is that even though there have been plenty of underdogs cashing (they were 12-4-1 ATS on Monday), there's sure to be plenty more.

espn.com,,Tamika Catchings book excerpt -- Catch a Star,[],"Excerpt: 'I knew basketball was going to be my game'

David Sherman/NBAE/Getty Images Tamika Catchings, whose book went on sale Tuesday, has said she will retire after the 2016 Olympics and WNBA season.

Excerpted from Catch a Star: Shining Through Adversity to Become a Champion by Tamika Catchings with Ken Petersen. Copyright  2016. Published by Revell, a division of Baker Publishing Group. Used by permission.

It's almost like there's a basketball gene that our parents passed down to their children. The Catchingses had it, big time-my dad playing in the pros with Dr. J and the 76ers; my older sister, Tauja, eventually playing in college and beyond; and my older brother, Kenyon, playing on his high school team until his dreams for the game were cut short by illness.

But more than any of them, I was bound and determined to be a basketball player. Even as a young girl, I knew basketball was going to be my game. And, no, it wasn't that I just had lucky genes. A lot of people have physical ability to play-height and agility-but to play well at a high level requires more. Intensity. Desire. Passion. Focus. Determination. Hard work.

Back then, at the age of nine, I didn't have the physique for the game. Not yet. I was small, but really because of my slouching to ""blend in."" And not only that, but I couldn't hear very well-I'd been born with moderate to severe hearing loss.

But so what if I was skinny and short and couldn't hear much? What I did have was intensity. I had desire. And I had passion and a willingness to work hard for the game like no one else in my family.

Later in life my dad would say one reason I got so good was because of all those early years playing against Tauja, who was the best talent around. I think that's right. She made me better. She was a year older, taller than me then, and in my eyes just perfect all around.

Chris Bucher Photographs Tamika Catchings' book details stories of her childhood, her struggles with hearing loss and bullying, and how she founded the Catch the Stars Foundation.

All those realities just made me compete harder.

We'd play so physical that we'd sometimes send the other flying, with a yell or a shriek, clearly a foul in any refereed game but perfectly acceptable on the court of our driveway arena. We'd scrape an arm or a knee, wipe off a little blood, and start playing again, yelling and taunting and at times screaming at each other.

My dad tells about that day, how the yelling and screaming got to be too much for him. He could tell we were playing each other hard. He knew there'd been some blood. He'd heard one scream too many. He walked out on the porch and yelled, ""That's enough!""

We froze in our tracks. He came out to the driveway, confiscated the ball, and took it inside with him.

Frustrated, Tauja stormed up to her room. I knew she'd probably play with her dolls after she cooled down. Dad settled back down inside.

Sometime later, as Dad tells it, he looked up from his paper and realized Tauja had come into the house, but I hadn't. Where's Tamika? he thought.

Looking outside, he saw me still in the driveway. And there I was-playing.

With an imaginary basketball.

He watched me dribble my invisible ball behind my back, through my legs, then toward the basket, where I'd launch myself for an imaginary layup. And I picked up that pretend ball as if it were real and walked it to the back of the driveway. And I'd start all over-dribbling, dodging an imaginary player so I could get free, jump, and shoot my imaginary ball, for an imaginary three-pointer, from beyond an imaginary arc.

I did this again and again. Over and over.

I could hear the game in my head.

What I couldn't hear for real, I could hear in another way. The smack, smack of the ball as it bounced on concrete, the slap of my hand against rubber as I grabbed the ball on the upward bounce, and the oh-so-lovely swish as my imaginary shot arced through the air and slipped cleanly between the rim-nothing but net.

In imagining the game, it was like I could sense other players, where they were on the court, even without hearing a thing. It was as if I could hear one player racing stealthily from behind, rushing in from the side to swipe a steal, and I could feel the vibration of his or her thudding feet just in time to grab the ball from my dribble and swing it away.

As I played within my silence, I could dart and weave through the holes in the defense, racing toward the basket. As I jumped, the imaginary ball rolled off my fingertips against the backboard. And it was as if I could hear it, the sound of it banking against the glass, clanging on the rim-once, twice, and more-before finally, finally, finally falling in.

Yes, basketball was my game.",[]

The Kansas City Chiefs are finalizing a five-year deal with offensive tackle Mitchell Schwartz, sources tell ESPN.

Also Wednesday, the Browns lost center Alex Mack to Atlanta, where he signed a five-year deal with the Falcons.

Schwartz is a cerebral player dubbed ""the Oracle"" by his fellow linemen, ""because he's so smart he knows everything,"" teammate Joe Thomas has said.

According to ProFootballFocus, the Broncos' Von Miller had only one game when he had a negative grade -- when he lined up across from Schwartz in Week 6 last season.

The analytics site rated Schwartz as one of the top two or three best tackles in the league, crediting him with allowing just three sacks, eight hits and 32 hurries in 705 pass-rush snaps. The 705 pass-blocking snaps tied for the most in the league -- and Browns quarterbacks held the ball longer than the league average.

PHILADELPHIA -- As Aaron Gordon and his friend got into the backseat of a black town car outside the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia two weeks ago, a group of autograph-seekers bolted down Broad Street.

These days, Gordon's signature is in higher demand than it used to be, and he graciously signed all of the fans' items before closing the car door and departing for dinner at a nearby Italian restaurant.

Make no mistake: Gordon wanted to finish first in the 2016 NBA Slam Dunk Contest and take home the trophy. In his mind, he had executed all his dunks to perfection -- including his jaw-dropping ""Take a Chair in the Air"" dunk over Orlando Magic mascot Stuff that still has America buzzing.

Editor's Picks LaVine slams Gordon, repeats as dunk champion Timberwolves guard Zach LaVine unleashed a variety of dunks from the free throw line to edge an equally impressive Aaron Gordon to win the NBA's slam dunk contest.

Mazzeo: Myles Turner has a style all his own Myles Turner can hit 3s, run and block LeBron. He is an all-new, all-different talent for the Indiana Pacers and the NBA. 1 Related

But all the praise and adulation he's received since finishing as the runner-up (and we use the term loosely) to two-time defending champion Zach LaVine in overtime hasn't been a bad consolation prize.

The day after Gordon put on an aerial display that arguably rivaled some of the all-time greats, the 20-year-old's agent, Calvin Andrews, told him, ""Sometimes when you lose, you win.""

Since then, the Magic's starting power forward has earned a Twitter shoutout from Hall of Famer Dominique Wilkins, has gained nearly 170,000 followers on Instagram and has begun talks about endorsement opportunities with a number of companies.

Media requests have also begun to pile up. This week, while in Los Angeles during the Magic's West Coast road trip, Gordon will appear on ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" and ESPN's The Jump with Rachel Nichols.

""I'm extremely grateful for every single thing that comes my way,"" Gordon told ESPN.com. ""One hundred interviews, 200 interviews, I don't care. It's all good. You roll with it. I'm excited to show the world who I am.""

Gordon's life has certainly changed recently, even though the down-to-earth, second-year pro who plays the piano during his downtime remains focused on ""staying present, staying humble and staying grateful."" He had dozens of family and friends in attendance at Monday night's Magic-Warriors game in Oakland, which happens to be a half-hour drive from his native San Jose, California.

""It's crazy, because now everyone is like, 'Oh my god, here is this crazy dunker ...' And for me, maybe the outside perception shifts, but I've known I could do all that for a long time now,"" Gordon said.

In 2014, Gordon realized his boyhood dream of making it to the NBA. Brad Penner/USA TODAY Sports

Gordon's mother, Shelly Davis, jokes that her youngest son was so ball-obsessed growing up that she thought he was part golden retriever. One day when Shelly was stopped at a traffic light at a busy intersection, a young Aaron opened the car door and chased after a tennis ball he'd spotted in a nearby gutter. Fortunately, no one got hurt.

Height, explosion and athletic prowess run in the Gordon genes. In fact, Aaron's paternal great-grandfather was purported to be a 7-foot Native American from the Osage tribe in Oklahoma. Aaron's father, Ed Gordon, stood 6-foot-6 and played basketball at San Diego State before earning a tryout with the New England Patriots based solely on his athleticism; Shelly recalls Ed being able to do a standing backflip on the sidewalk.

Aaron's older siblings, 6-foot-9 Drew and 6-1 Elise, played college basketball at New Mexico and Harvard, respectively. Drew, who is continuing his career overseas in France, appeared in nine games for the Philadelphia 76ers last season.

Aaron, now 6-9, hoped to follow in their footsteps, but that journey got off to a rough start.

It started with a third-grade assignment, in which he wrote that his dream was to play in the NBA. But only a year later, Aaron suffered a torn ACL after being undercut in a youth-league game. That same week, his mother said, Aaron suffered a major concussion after hitting his head on the railing of the bleachers while he was watching his team play. He needed the better part of a year to rehab his ACL. He was just 11.

But things got better.

He did the same plyometrics Drew did, doing jumping exercises while wearing a weighted vest. He was also involved in multiple sports -- he played basketball, football and hockey and competed in the high jump. By middle school, Aaron stood 6 feet tall. And the one thing he could always do was jump.

The first time Aaron dunked in a game was in seventh grade -- a rim-grazer, but a dunk nonetheless.

Drew, a talented dunker in his own right, was tough on his younger brother, often blocking Aaron's shots and ultimately making him a better player. Like Drew, Aaron starred at Archbishop Mitty High School, and his exploits above the rim soon became well known.

Gordon scored 24 points -- 12 of them via dunks -- in the 2013 McDonald's All-American game en route to securing MVP honors. He also participated in the dunk contest, although he did not win. Gordon went on to play a year at Arizona before being selected No. 4 overall by the Magic in the 2014 NBA draft.

His next chance at the dunk contest would have to wait a few years.

It took him a while to develop it, but Gordon's ""Take a Chair in the Air"" dunk brought the house down. Vaughn Ridley/Getty Images

""Hell yeah!"" Gordon screamed inside the Magic's quiet practice facility. ""Let's go!""

It was Feb. 9, his final practice before rehearsal in Toronto three days later, and, for the first time in 12 attempts, Gordon had finally successfully completed his most difficult dunk: jumping over Magic mascot Stuff while grabbing the ball off Stuff's head, putting it underneath both of his legs and finishing with his off hand (his left).

""I think it was just easier for me to angle my body, so I had to bite the bullet on that one [using my left],"" Gordon said. ""I don't ever dunk with my left hand. It took a while [to get it down]. That was the first time I'd ever tried something like that. I have videos on my phone of me getting closer, getting closer, getting closer, and then, boom, I nailed it. I was just super-hyped.""

""The hardest part about that dunk is you have to commit. You get up so high, and then you're super off-balance and your legs aren't under you anymore and you're not used to that feeling."" Aaron Gordon

In order to dethrone LaVine, Gordon was going to have to get creative. Hoverboards proved to be a trendy gimmick that could provide an edge. Gordon accepted his invitation from the NBA without hesitation in mid-January, but didn't begin seriously practicing until three weeks before the contest. Perfectly understandable, given the rigors of the 82-game regular season.

Gordon practiced three times following back-to-back sets, when the team had days off. His routine was built by combining ideas from his agent, family, friends and fellow high-fliers. Gordon did his dunks over a 6-1 team manager before bringing in Stuff in early February. At first, they went through everything without the mascot costume. Then, they brought in the hoverboard. It was a gradual process.

After nailing his ""Take a Chair in the Air"" dunk twice more in rehearsals, Gordon was extremely confident about his chances and ready to take flight in Toronto.

""The hardest part about that dunk is you have to commit,"" Gordon said. ""You get up so high, and then you're super off-balance and your legs aren't under you anymore and you're not used to that feeling.""

Growing up, Gordon always wore hand-me-downs from his older brother. But ever since he's been in the NBA, Gordon has developed a unique fashion sense.

So for his opening statement at the dunk contest, he wanted style and flair. Gordon and his sister decided he should walk into the arena wearing a breakaway suit, which they had custom-made. He came out to ""Classic Man"" by Jidenna, then ripped off the suit and went to work.

He admitted, though, that he received mixed reviews on the entrance.

Taking center stage, Gordon was in his element, all eyes fixed on him.

""It's the best feeling in the world,"" Gordon said. ""I was way more relaxed than I was in the McDonald's contest.""

He received a 45 for his first dunk -- an East Bay 360 in which he went between his legs as he was rotating (also his final dunk in McDonald's). He missed his first attempt at his second dunk -- a between-the-legs attempt over Stuff while the mascot was on a hoverboard -- but made his second, resulting in a score of 49. Shaquille O'Neal was the only judge to give the dunk a 9, which earned brother Drew's ire on Twitter.

Gordon advanced to the finals against LaVine -- who scored a 50 and a 49 on his dunks in the first two rounds -- and turned things up a notch, securing back-to-back perfect scores. Gordon's 360 Scoop in which he took the ball from Stuff after the mascot did a few revolutions on the hoverboard was impressive, but nothing could compare to what came next.

""The only other dunk that comes to mind is [my favorite dunker] Vince Carter's reserve 360 windmill in 2000,"" Gordon said. ""That's the only other one that comes to mind.""

Gordon then performed an under-the-legs, left-handed dunk while vaulting 7 feet, 7 inches over Stuff -- or high enough to win the bronze medal in the high jump at the 2012 Olympics, according to ESPN's ""Sports Science.""

Bedlam ensued. Social media blew up. Memes were created. One featuring milk and cookies became Gordon's mother's favorite.

""Let's go home! Let's go home!"" TNT analyst Kenny Smith yelled.

""He should've gotten like a 70 or something -- 100, maybe,"" Elfrid Payton said.

""I had what felt like an out-of-body experience,"" Gordon said. ""I don't know what I was thinking or feeling. I thought I had it wrapped up.""

So did everyone else. Only he didn't. LaVine matched him 50 for 50, taking off and finishing a windmill dunk from the free throw line.

Gordon had only prepared four dunks, so overtime proved to be a struggle. LaVine put two more perfect scores together to win the title.

Many believed Gordon should've won or there should've been a tie. Still, Gordon was gracious in defeat.

""It's a judgment,"" Gordon said. ""In my opinion, I did extremely well and did exactly what I needed to do. I'm extremely grateful for the opportunity. It was awesome. There was nothing to be disappointed about. It would've been cool to have the trophy, but Zach is a freak, and the majority of his dunks were 50s. It's not too bad to lose to that guy.""",[]

River y Boca jugaron un partido triste, sin emociones y el gran perdedor de todo esto, es Boca Juniors que hace mas de 180 minutos que no convierte un gol... Mi pregunta es la siguiente, como hara Boca para ganarle a Racing en los proximos dias?

Este domingo Racing jugo su mejor partido en mucho tiempo y le gano con mucha solvencia a Union. Racing golea y Boca ni siquiera puede convertir goles. Sin duda, la situacion de ambos equipos es muy distinta.

Racing es un equipo que juega, que tiene tres o cuatro delanteros geniales como Milito, el colombiano Roger y el incansable Lisandro Lopez y eso sin contar a Bou que esta lesionado. Como hara Boca para ganarle a este equipazo?

Muchos dicen que Racing esta flojo en defensa que hace cuatro goles y le embocan tres. Que es un equipo en ataque y otro en defensa. No lo creo asi, en el futbol importan los goles que haces y no los que te hacen...

De todas formas, los hinchas de Boca ya estan temblando, saben que, con este equipo con tienen muchas oportunidades ni alegrias. Tevez se agota en si mismo, necesita un equipo que lo acompane y no encuentra su lugar en la cancha.

Para esto que escribo no quede en una impresion mia, sali a la calle a preguntarle a un par de hinchas de Boca, me sorprendieron con sus respuestas.

Ivan Antonio Caceres, 56 anos, hincha de Boca: ""Mira Cucu, el equipo da lastima y no creo que el Mellizo pueda cambiar su forma de jugar. Ahora de ahi a pensar que es un equipo regalado es una locura total. Boca es Boca, tiene una historia y una trayectoria unica. Creo que le va a costar mas a Racing"".

Optimista Ivan Antonio... Veamos que dice Lopez Arancibia Hammet, 37 anos, ex hincha de Boca: ""Mira Cucu, para ser totalmente objetivo y no dejar que el corazon me engane que es lo que suele sucedernos a los hinchas de Boca, te dire que estamos mal, y necesitamos tocar fondo para volver a jugar como siempre. Ahora que nuestro mal momento signifique que Racing pueda ganarnos es una locura total. Racing es incapaz de ganarle a Boca#

Y asi son los hinchas de Boca, unos locos de primera, tienen la fe como marca de vida y no la largan aunque el equipo ya no de senales de vida. Ni siquiera con el Mellizo en el banco pueden ganar un partido!

Pero ahi estan, aguantando los trapos, soldados del futbol. Mientras las estrellitas de Boca tienen problemas en el encendido o se les acabaron las pilas, ellos, los hinchas bancan al equipo a muerte. Y solo por este motivo, quizas el unico real que tenga Boca Juniors, este equipo remonte, comience a jugar bien un dias de estos y me haga callar la boca de una buena vez.",[]

espn.com,,Ladarius Green to sign with Pittsburgh Steelers,['Ben Goessling'],"Former San Diego Chargers tight end Ladarius Green is expected to sign with the Pittsburgh Steelers, a source told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter.

The signing, which cannot be official until the start of the new league year at 4 p.m. ET Wednesday, comes in the wake of longtime Steelers tight end Heath Miller's retirement in February.

The Steelers are high on Jesse James, last year's fifth-round pick, but a Green signing adds depth and playmaking. Plus the Steelers value tight ends who block, and they feel Green is an adequate blocker.

Editor's Picks Fowler: Steelers add another playmaker in Green Ladarius Green is not a Heath Miller replacement, or at least the Steelers won't look at it that way. This was a chance to sign an impact player at a position of need as Pittsburgh's playmaking depth just got deeper, Jeremy Fowler writes.

Green played well while Antonio Gates sat out the first part of the 2015 season for a suspension, totaling 14 receptions for 174 yards and two touchdowns through the first four games.

The 2012 fourth-round pick did not have much of an impact in the second half of the year, as nagging injuries slowed his production. In his final eight games, Green totaled 11 catches for 125 yards and zero touchdowns. He finished the season on injured reserve with an ankle issue.

Gates re-signed with the Chargers on Wednesday, agreeing to a two-year contract.

For the 2015 season, Green played 627 offensive snaps, totaling 37 catches for 429 yards and four touchdowns. Green averages 14.1 yards per reception for his career and turns 26 years old in May.

espn.com,,LeBron James says Cleveland Cavaliers not ready for playoffs after loss to Grizzlies,"['Tim Macmahon', 'Anthony Olivieri', 'Dave Mcmenamin']","ESPN NBA analyst Tim Legler breaks down what went wrong for the Cavaliers in their loss to a depleted Grizzlies team. (2:39)

CLEVELAND -- In what was expected to be about as one-sided a matchup as one can find in the NBA, the Cleveland Cavaliers fell flat on their faces in a 106-103 loss to the short-handed Memphis Grizzlies on Monday.

The Cavs had all their top rotation players available, were coming off a day off, were playing at Quicken Loans Arena (where they had built a 27-5 record) and were riding a three-game win streak. They hosted a Grizzlies team that was missing four starters -- including Mike Conley (left foot soreness), Zach Randolph (rest) and Marc Gasol (right foot surgery) -- and had just eight players in uniform as it played on the road on the second night of a back-to-back. Even so, it was Cleveland that looked like the underdog from the start.

""I can sit up here and say that we're a team that's ready to start the playoffs tomorrow, but we're not,"" LeBron James said after the Cavs trailed by as many as 14 before losing at the buzzer when Kyrie Irving missed a potential game-tying 3. ""We're still learning. We still have things that happen on the court that just, that shouldn't happen.""

""To have 25 turnovers for 30 points -- I don't care who you're playing, it could be my son's little league team -- you're going to lose when you give up that many turnovers just from carelessness,"" LeBron James said. Kyle Liam/NBAE via Getty Images

Chief among those mistakes was the Cavs' coughing up a season-high 25 turnovers, which led to 30 points by the Grizzlies.

""We gave up a lot of pick-sixes,"" James said. ""In NFL terms, that means it's straight to the house. To have 25 turnovers for 30 points -- I don't care who you're playing, it could be my son's little league team -- you're going to lose when you give up that many turnovers just from carelessness.""

Kevin Love was pragmatic afterward.

""We just could have done a better job of respecting the game,"" Love said. ""A team like that, they were going to come out and swing for the fences, and they did. That was a real bad loss for us. ... Turnovers were terrible. That was what I mean, respecting the game.""

""We just could have done a better job of respecting the game. ... That was a real bad loss for us."" Kevin Love

Not only were the Cavs, at 44-17 before the game, in better position to win than the beleaguered 37-25 Grizzlies squad (now 38-25), but also, when the two teams met earlier this season, Cleveland beat Memphis by 30 points on the Grizzlies' home court. The Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook listed the Cavs as 15-point favorites coming into the night.

""I just thought they were tougher than us tonight,"" Cavs coach Tyronn Lue said. ""Thought they played hard and out-scrapped us. You got to respect everybody in this league. Everyone gets a paycheck. That was the message before the game.""

When James was asked whether he was ""fearful"" of the Grizzlies before tipoff, considering that all the ingredients for a trap game were in place, he conceded.

""I was,"" James said. ""I was, especially because we had gone over everything with the expectation of those guys being in the lineup this morning, and to get here before the game and to find out that no one, pretty much, that we went over [in the shootaround scouting session] played. But as professionals, you got to respect them. We're all in this league for a reason, and we didn't respect them tonight, and they beat us.""

Irving, whose season-high seven turnovers marred the 27 points (14 in the fourth), five assists and four steals he registered, also pointed to the lineup change as contributing to the result.

""I just think for us, as a maturing, young team, we just have to come out and play everybody the same way,"" he said. ""For me, last day-and-a-half I spend watching film on Mike Conley, and then damn near before tipoff I find out he's not playing and Z-Bo is not playing, and our shootaround was dedicated to stopping these two guys, and then we come in and the whole thing changes. We just have to get better as a team preparing for anybody that is out there on the floor -- myself included.""

""We just have to get better as a team preparing for anybody that is out there on the floor -- myself included."" Kyrie Irving

Lue warned reporters before the game that his team could be vulnerable, despite its apparent advantage.

""It's always dangerous because we tend to let our guards down,"" Lue said. ""It's going to be my job tonight to make sure that we don't do that. We've done that a few times this year, and every time their star and key guys sit out, we tend to take a step backward and kind of relax a little bit. These guys coming off the bench or these guys proving that they need minutes or want minutes, they play hard, and we got to be able to accept the challenge.""

After the game, Lue said, ""I've already learned a wounded animal is the most dangerous."" This season, Cleveland has lost to a Charlotte team without Kemba Walker and Al Jefferson and a Portland team missing Damian Lillard.

If Memphis coach Dave Joerger's attitude reflected his team's, then the Grizzlies certainly didn't have a problem respecting the Cavs.

""They're a great team,"" Joerger said. ""Every shot that they shoot, you expect to go in.""

Cleveland will try to bounce back with a four-game road trip starting Wednesday in Sacramento.

""It's going to be good,"" James said. ""Going to be a good test for us.""",[]

Wiggins and Cavendish won the 2008 title in Manchester before their road careers took off. Wiggins became the first British Tour de France winner in 2012, while Cavendish has won 26 Tour stages and the 2011 road race world title before returning to the track.

The pair reprised their partnership for one last time at world level and won in emphatic fashion before saluting the crowd and Wiggins kissed the track after Britain's fifth gold of the five-day event.

Wiggins said: ""You couldn't have written a better script. It was like deja vu from eight years ago. We went on to conquer the world in those eight years, like Barack Obama.""

And almost completing the sentence, Cavendish added: ""And then come round full circle.""

Wiggins added: ""We've had a good term in presidency. Come back, full circle and won it again.""

Cavendish now has three world titles in the discipline and four in all, after also winning the 2005 title with Rob Hayles in Los Angeles.

Wiggins, who supported Cavendish in his road race win in 2011, has eight world titles: the road time-trial world title from 2014, plus seven on the track.

Wiggins took off his helmet to salute the crowd in celebration and Cavendish raised his arms aloft as 'the boys are back in town' played at the Lee Valley VeloPark.

Wiggins dismounted his bike and kissed the track where he set the Hour Record last June -- the breadth of the four-time Olympic champion's success is astounding -- following a crowd-pleasing win.

Wiggins said: ""Just to send all those people away happy -- like when the [Stone] Roses played at Heaton Park in 2012, it was a good gig, wasn't it? Everyone went home happy. It was like us two getting back together again.""

The pair have plenty of shared history on the road and track and added to it over 200 laps [50km] of the London Velodrome in the Madison.

""In 50 years' time -- you see those iconic photos of [Tom] Simpson now and you think what those images will be like,"" Wiggins said.

The pair scored points early on, winning three straight sprints, before taking a late lap which ensured a crash for Cavendish mattered little.

The 30-year-old from the Isle of Man hit the deck inside the final 10 laps as Wiggins crossed the line to seal victory.

Wiggins added: ""I was like 'cheeky little... Where is he?' I kept looking for him, thinking it had been a long turn.

""I didn't realise he'd crashed. I was out of it by then, just foaming at the mouth for the last 10 laps.""

Cavendish added: ""Of all my three world titles, I have never crossed the line on lap zero to win. It's always been my partner.""

Cavendish was surly when it was suggested he performed better than he had in the six-discipline, two-day omnium, when he finished sixth.

""I felt good in the omnium,"" he added.

""Brad and I complement each other really well for the Madison. It's like the perfect pairing.""

The duo plan to ride together into next autumn, possibly at the London Six Days, and also on the continental Six Day circuit.

Wiggins, who plans to retire from top-level competition after the Rio Olympics, said: ""We have to [ride the Six Day events]. It will be like the old days. I'll put my retirement back, definitely.""

Cavendish is vying for selection for the Rio Olympics, but must also be able to ride the four-man, four kilometres team pursuit in which Wiggins his targeting his fifth Games gold and British record eighth Olympic medal.

espn.com,,Olympic golf test event takes place in Rio de Janeiro,"['Gordon Simpson', 'Sue Mott', 'Mechelle Voepel', 'Bonnie D', 'Johnette Howard', 'Espn Staff', 'Adriana Terrazas']","RIO DE JANEIRO -- The Olympic golf test event began Tuesday in Rio de Janeiro, although only low-ranking Brazilian players were taking part.

Nine Brazilians -- five men and four women -- are playing the course after the PGA Tour was unable to persuade any of the world's top players to participate. Alexandre Rocha, the top-ranked men's player at No. 588, teed off the stroke-play exhibition match on the course, which is sandwiched between a sewage-polluted lagoon and luxury apartment towers in the western Rio neighborhood known as Barra da Tijuca.

Golf is making a return to the Olympics after 112 years, but the delivery of the course in Rio has been dogged by delays involving environmental lawsuits and land ownership disputes.

Part of the course was built on an environmentally protected area, and its construction was funded by a developer who received the right to build luxury apartments on the land in return. Critics contend the golf course was used as an excuse for a land-grab by an area property mogul.

Critics also argue that the location of the course was chosen without proper consultation, and that there was no reason to build a brand new course because golf is not a popular sport in Brazil and Rio already has a course that could have been used for the Olympics.

Designed by the American golf architect Gil Hanse, the course was eventually handed over to organizers in November. Because of the delays, there were worries that the grass might not have sufficient growing time, but they've proved unfounded.

Speaking Tuesday at the start of the test event, Brazil's Sports Minister George Hilton defended the course and said it had helped to boost the area's biodiversity.

""We are taking good care of the environment around the course,"" Hilton said. ""We have recovered this whole area, which will be good for tourism, for business as well as for locals.""

Paulo Pacheco, the head of the Brazilian golf federation, said the course would soon be considered ""one of the best in the world.""

He said the Olympics would prove a massive boost, spurring many to take up the sport in Brazil.

""As soon as we see a couple of Brazilian stars,"" he said, ""we will see the sport take root here.""",[]
espn.com,,Justin Upton says he's 'fine' after ankle injury forces him from game,['Katie Strang'],"LAKELAND, Fla. -- Justin Upton left the trainer's room with no noticeable limp and did not seem concerned about his left ankle after an injury forced him from Wednesday's game against the Washington Nationals.

The Detroit Tigers' 28-year-old nearly collided with center fielder Anthony Gose during the second inning of the club's 11-5 win at Joker Marchant stadium and wound up getting his left ankle stepped on. This prompted the Tigers to remove him from the game for precautionary reasons.

Upton said Gose stepped on his ankle and it rolled a little, but that he wasn't too worried.

I'm fine, Upton said. I'm flexible.

Upton, who was originally slated to be the designated hitter on Thursday in Clearwater against the Philadelphia Phillies, said he would not be playing. Manager Brad Ausmus, however, left the door open for him to still play.

We didn't send him for X-rays or anything, Ausmus said. As a matter of fact, we're going to check in tomorrow (Thursday) because he's scheduled to DH [on Thursday], so we're going to check in in the morning and there's a possibility on how he feels in the morning that he may just DH anyway. But we're going to wait and see on that.

Ausmus said Upton, who signed a six-year $132.75 million deal to join the Tigers as a free agent this offseason, did not require stitches.

Tigers ace Justin Verlander, who threw three scoreless innings in his second start of the spring, admitted it was a scary moment to see the team's star outfielder slow to get up and leave the field with head athletic trainer Kevin Rand.

You never want to see that, said Verlander who threw 51 pitches and allowed only one hit. But if you do, early in spring training is better than late. It's tricky, this time in spring, it's probably a little bit of miscommunication.

Gose and him aren't use to playing outfield together so the communication's not quite there and then as windy as it is, it makes it even more difficult for those guys to communicate.

The Tigers are already down one outfielder in Cameron Maybin, who broke his left wrist after being hit by a pitch from Luis Severino in a game against the New York Yankees last week. Maybin, who was expected to platoon in center with Gose, is out four to six weeks, with his availability for the season opener in jeopardy (keep in mind, also, that Gose was also removed from the game for precautionary reasons.)

ESPN.com's Jayson Stark reported on Sunday that while the Tigers are not actively pursuing an outfielder, they are at least checking into potential options if Maybin is out longer than expected.

For now, the Tigers are discussing internal options, including Wynton Bernard, who had a terrific season last year in Double-A Erie.

We've talked about it. No decisions, obviously, have been made, Ausmus said.",[]
espn.com,,Polt claims his 4th World Championship Series title,"['James Obscurica', 'James Bates', 'Alan Nahaz', 'Obscurica Chen', 'Stephen Chiu', 'Michael Rothstein', 'Timothy Lee', 'Tyler Fionn', 'Arash Markazi', 'Chase Geddes']","There are common cliches that a caster says about every player no matter the game:

""If anyone can make a comeback here, it is this player.""

""If he plays at his best, he has a shot to beat any player in the world.""

Both are innocuous statements meant to fill up air and try to keep the viewer engaged, but when they're scrutinized, they prove to be flimsy. Not everyone can win a championship. Even on their best days, mediocre players can never beat the best players, even on the best players' worst days. However, when applied to certain professionals, like Choi ""Polt"" Seong Hun, both statements hold truth.

Polt is one of the oldest veterans in the scene. He has been playing since the first Global StarCraft II League Open back in 2010, where he unveiled his 1-1-1 strategy and knocked out one of the favorites of the tournament Jang ""MC"" Min Chul. Since then, he's accrued multiple achievements to his name: GSL, ASUS ROG, Major League Gaming, Red Bull, and now, his fourth World Championship Series titles and numerous top 4 placings.

Yet he isn't some monster in the closet, some unstoppable juggernaut that no one can surpass. He hasn't been that way since his heyday back in 2012 or his second peak at the end of 2013/early 2014. If you look at the tangible skills he has, they aren't incredible. His micro wavers between below average to above average. His macro is lackluster. His APM lower than most pros (though very efficient). He often gets supply blocked. In these raw skill sets, there are many foreign players you can say are superior to him.

Choi ""Polt"" Seong Hun at the 2015 WCS Season 3 Finals Patrick Strack/ESL

Yet, it is Polt that is raising up his fourth WCS title; it is Polt who is one of the great all-time players; it is Polt that we laud as the champion. Why? The answer is because he makes the most out of what he has. Polt's strength is in his tactical genius, his composure and his experience. If there is one player you can count on to make a comeback in a game, it's Polt. He's proven it for years now as his standard modus operandi has been to lose the early and mid-game, but surge back in the late game with his superior tactical and strategic might. Polt is the player who finds his own paths to victory and understands his own strengths and how they match up to any player in the world. It is why Polt on his best day can still challenge the best players from Korea despite dropping sets or matches to a lot of players from overseas. He knows how to win with the tools available to him.

And this time Polt met Jens ""Snute"" Aasgaard in the finals. Snute is one of the all-time great foreign players of SCII; a player of great mechanical skill and a great strategic mind. Like Polt, he finds his own ways to victory and pursues his ideal style of always taking it to the late game and outplaying his opponents there. However, Snute's biggest weakness has always been his nerves. He can beat anyone in the earlier rounds of a tournament, even GSL and StarCraft II StarLeague Champions. But once it got to the round-of-8 and beyond, he'd start crumbling, playing nervously, indecisively. This didn't happen at all this WCS. Instead, Snute played more clutch than he ever has; more composed than he ever has.

In Polt's winner's interview, he alluded to this fact himself. He praised Snute as a great player, a player that forced him to pull out everything he had to win this finals. When you look at this series, you can't help but feel that is true. Polt's typical modus operandi is to just play for the late game. To take the hit early on in the games and play it out strategically. This time he mixed it up. He attacked Snute's weakness in the early game with outdated timing attacks that Snute would have no way to have practiced against for years. He won the late game with superior tactical skill and taking advantage of the map design to choke Snute economically. Despite playing well, Snute was only able to take two maps: one was a timing attack he executed himself, the other was light pressure that caught Polt off guard while he was going to execute a 5 rax all-in. It was then dragged to the late game where Snute closed it out easily.

Yet Polt's experience, preparation and skill won out. And with this victory he adds more hardware to his trophy case. Another achievement to add to one of SC2's greatest players. As for Polt himself? With his sponsorship ending with CMStorm, he is now looking to step forward onto the next part of his career. When asked by Paul ""Redeye"" Chaloner if he was looking for any teams, Polt simply said:

""I'm not looking. They will come to me.""

A fitting attitude for the best player in WCS and one of SCII's greatest players.",[]
espn.com,,David Price's initial breakthrough came at the expense of Boston Red Sox,['Scott Lauber'],"FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Jim Hickey doubts he will ever forget the conversation.

It was the eighth inning of the seventh game of the 2008 American League Championship Series, and the Tampa Bay Rays were using up relief pitchers like cocktail napkins in an effort to hold a 3-1 lead over the Boston Red Sox. Dan Wheeler got the first out and left-hander J.P. Howell erased David Ortiz for the second before side-arming Chad Bradford walked Kevin Youkilis to load the bases.

That was when Rays manager Joe Maddon turned to Hickey, his trusted pitching coach.

""Are we OK?"" Maddon asked. ""Can we do this?""

""If you want to see David Price standing on the mound in the ninth inning,"" Hickey said. ""If you're OK with that.""

""Yeah,"" Maddon said, one foot planted on the turf at Tropicana Field, ""I am.""

And with that, the now-highest-paid pitcher in baseball history got his first close-up.

Before David Price was the Red Sox's $217 million man, a Cy Young winner or even a proven No. 1 starter, he was a secret weapon.

Drafted first overall in 2007 out of Vanderbilt, Price whipped through the minors like a tornado. He made his big league debut in September 2008, one month after his 23rd birthday, and although the Rays had no room for him in the rotation, they put him on the playoff roster anyway, knowing full well that a 6-foot-6 lefty with a high-90s fastball could be useful.

Price was the ultimate X factor, a blank slate in the Red Sox's scouting report. They hadn't seen him live until Maddon used him in the ninth inning of an ALCS Game 1 loss and had minimal video from his 19 minor-league starts that year.

""At that time, he was somebody brand new,"" former Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek said. ""He was very powerful through the zone. That's kind of all he was then, but to have that weapon, the ability he had to come in late in a game and throw strikes and be that powerful from the left side was pretty impressive.""

But it was more than just Price's electric fastball that gave the Rays so much confidence. Having played in a high-profile college program, he had a polish and self-assurance that is uncommon among pitchers with such little big league experience.

Before becoming a dominant starter and Cy Young Award winner for the Rays, David Price pitched in relief and helped eliminate the Red Sox in the 2008 ALCS. Jesse Johnson/USA TODAY Sports

""Since day one when he first came into Tropicana Field, it was obvious,"" Hickey said. ""Extremely intelligent kid, extremely respectful. There's a number of guys that can throw 97, 98, 99 that you would never even consider putting out there in a situation like that. With David, you knew that he would be able to handle it.""

Still, Maddon and Hickey weren't entirely sure how to deploy Price. A trained starter with all of six career relief appearances, he recorded the final two outs in the top of the 11th inning of Game 2 but didn't pitch in the next four games, the Rays preferring to lean on a deep bullpen that included Grant Balfour, Howell, Wheeler, Bradford and Trever Miller.

And with everyone, including starters Scott Kazmir and James Shields, on call for Game 7, Price recalls leaving his house and telling visiting family and friends, ""There's no chance I'm getting in this game.""

But now, with four outs to go, he was Maddon's best bet to get the Rays to their first World Series.

""Now it makes all the sense in the world because you've watched him pitch for eight years now,"" said former Sox backup catcher Kevin Cash, Maddon's successor as Rays manager. ""But back then, you remember just the poise he had for a young player being put in that type of position. It was impressive.""

The first out was the biggest.

Part of the reason Maddon called on Price, even with right-handed Balfour still available, was the matchup against lefty-swinging J.D. Drew. The count went full before Price unleashed a slider out of the strike zone. But plate umpire Brian Gorman ruled that Drew didn't check his swing, sending Tropicana Field into an ear-splitting frenzy and Price fist-pumping his way off the field.

""I get back to the dugout and sit down and I'm like, 'All right, atta baby, good job,'"" Price said. ""And Hickey walks over like, 'Hey, you're going back out for the ninth.' I'm like, 'All right, OK, all right. Let's do this.' I had to mentally lock it back in again.""

Jason Bay led off the bottom of the ninth and worked an eight-pitch walk by laying off a slider that Price still contends should have been a called third strike.

That's when Hickey began to get nervous.

""The plan was to go out there and -- he's a 6-foot-6 left-hander, they haven't seen him -- throw 97. It's pretty difficult to handle,"" Hickey said. ""So when he walks Bay with an offspeed pitch, I had a little bit of an 'Oh, shoot!' moment.""

But that was when Price proved he would be a future ace. He froze Mark Kotsay, then struck out Varitek in an at-bat the former Sox captain would sooner forget but was able to joke about when Price signed his seven-year contract in December.

""I knew I belonged in the big leagues, but everybody thinks they belong there. It's when you get there and you have those first couple experiences. If they don't go so well, especially in a situation like that, you could have some self-doubt. It was just a good boost of my confidence. 2008 was very big. It's definitely a big reason I am who I am today."" David Price

""Tek was like, 'Don't think you're big stuff because you struck me out. That's been done a lot,'"" Price said. ""It's all in good fun.""

Said Varitek: ""The electricity of that stage, so much at stake, the game didn't speed up on him. You had to commend the kid, the man, and he obviously showed enough fortitude to deserve that chance.""

Price got Jed Lowrie to roll into a fielder's choice for the pennant-clinching out, and the coming-of-age moment was complete.

A year later, Price became a full-fledged starter for the Rays, and in 2012, he went 20-5 with a 2.56 ERA and copped the AL Cy Young Award. Since 2010, he ranks second among AL starters in strikeouts (1,332) and innings pitched (1,29913) and fourth in ERA (2.97).

And now, he's the No. 1 starter the Red Sox haven't had since they traded Jon Lester midway through the 2014 season.

In all likelihood, Price would have reached those heights without his postseason experience in 2008. But he admits it was a springboard to helping him get there, ironically at the Sox's expense.

""I knew I belonged in the big leagues, but everybody thinks they belong there,"" Price said. ""It's when you get there and you have those first couple experiences. If they don't go so well, especially in a situation like that, you could have some self-doubt. It was just a good boost of my confidence. Two thousand and eight was very big. It's definitely a big reason I am who I am today.""",[]
espn.com,,What is the origin of the hatred toward daily fantasy sports?,"['Ben Fawkes', 'David Purdum', 'Darren Rovell', 'Mackenzie Kraemer', 'Steve Fainaru', 'Arash Markazi', 'Paula Lavigne', 'Ryan Rodenberg', 'Tim Fiorvanti']","For decades, the public was fine with fantasy sports. The biggest negative stereotype was that the game was played by nerdy stat geeks. When daily fantasy sports (DFS) was born, however, that perception changed.

Some folks will tell you the daily version of fantasy sports is infested with devious, high-tech sharks and even -- gulp -- hardened criminals.

In the early years of DFS, the haters mostly came from inside the burgeoning industry. Struggling players, looking for reasons why they were losing money, lobbed pot shots at successful players who had gained notoriety -- the faces of DFS. It amounted to infrequent, mild complaining on social media and online forums.

But that all changed after Week 3 of the 2015 NFL season.

On Oct. 5, a few hours before the Detroit Lions took on the Seattle Seahawks on Monday Night Football, the New York Times posted a story about Ethan Haskell, a young employee at daily fantasy operator DraftKings who had won $350,000 playing in an NFL contest on rival site FanDuel. There were allegations that he had used inside information.

All of a sudden, the tone of the DFS hatred went from whining to, in some cases, irrational venom. Many commenters told Haskell to ""die"" on social media.

""Basically, it had always been a thing that the 'faces of DFS' had to deal with,"" said one prominent daily fantasy player, who asked for anonymity to avoid further backlash. ""But after the story went national, it took on a whole different form.""

Politicians and lawmakers have taken aim at the DFS industry, firing haymakers, some more accurate than others. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman accused the leading operators, DraftKings and FanDuel, of ""fleecing"" sports fans. The sites and the Fantasy Sports Trade Association fired back with accusations of grandstanding. Even prominent attorney David Boies, who represents DraftKings and is a veteran of the back-and-forth discourse that takes place in high-profile cases, said he has been ""stunned"" by the level of rhetoric in ongoing cases about fantasy sports.

Washington state Rep. Christopher Hurst recently said the CEOs of DraftKings and FanDuel are ""no different than [drug lord] El Chapo in Mexico advertising heroin or the methamphetamine on our airwaves a thousand times a day to get kids to try it.""

Huh?

Where did the DFS hate come from, and how did the vitriol directed at the industry become so extreme? Over the past month, Chalk asked more than 20 sources inside and outside the industry. The three most common answers, in order: (1) the advertising, (2) the industry's ""not gambling"" stance and (3) the media coverage.

The advertising

In June 2015, longtime gambling industry executive Gene Johnson was at dinner with a CEO of a major daily fantasy sports operator, during which they discussed the CEO's plan for a massive DFS advertising blitz leading up to the football season. The CEO explained that, with their financing already in place, the marketing push was simply the next step of the business plan. Plus, their biggest competitor was preparing a similar approach; an advertising arms race was about to begin.

Johnson looked at the young CEO and said, ""Do you think that's a good idea?""

On Aug. 31, the peak of the DFS marketing blitz, DraftKings and FanDuel combined to air almost as many ads (1,285) as there are minutes in the day, according to iSpot.tv, which tracks advertising data. For three straight weeks in late August to early September, the two rival industry leaders had an ad on national TV every 90 seconds. Daily fantasy sports, a newer fantasy game that looks a lot like gambling to the general public, had become the most advertised product on TV.

(According to a recent report, ESPN's exclusive advertising deal with DFS operator DraftKings has ended. ESPN had no further comment.)

""Casino gaming has learned over the years to try and keep a low profile,"" said Johnson, a senior vice president for Spectrum Gaming Group. ""The DFS ad blitz put it in the public's face and provoked a negative backlash. [It wasn't] the wisest strategy, in retrospect.""

The relentless frequency of the ads was only part of the problem. Described as ""frat-boyish,"" ""aggravating,"" ""misleading"" and ""just plain dumb,"" by marketing experts as well as industry proponents at recent conferences in Florida and Texas, the quality of the content has also been an issue.

""They were trying very hard to sell, sell, sell,"" said Jason Stein, founder and CEO of marketing agency Laundry Service. ""And in the world we live in today, that's not what people really want. They want a transparent relationship, understanding who they are and what they believe in. By focusing so much on the transaction, it didn't add much value to users.""

Added Johnson: ""It created a negative attitude among casual sports fans and even some serious sports fans, because of the overload -- DFS fatigue, if you will. And that fatigue, because of the negative connotations of the advertising, it became ... the 'DFS hate.'""

But if the advertising was the gasoline, the match was the Haskell incident.

In the fall, Haskell -- a DraftKings employee who declined to be interviewed for this story -- inadvertently published information revealing what percentage of lineups included which players before the late afternoon slate of games had kicked off on the Sunday of his big win. It was a mistake akin to accidentally hitting ""reply all"" to the wrong office email, but was largely portrayed in the media as nefarious insider trading. Even though similar ownership data was available on other sites -- and the value of that information is viewed as minimal by some high-level players -- it was described as a ""distinct edge"" in some reports. True or not, the pitchforks were unveiled.

Weeks later, a third-party law firm commissioned by DraftKings released an investigation that found Haskell did not have the ownership data before his winning lineup was finalized and locked on FanDuel. It didn't matter. In the court of public opinion, he was a villain.

The ad blitz lasted through October. When it was over, DraftKings' and FanDuel's customer bases had grown significantly. But the industry leaders also found themselves under investigation by the New York Attorney General's office and a grand jury in Florida. ""The attorney general as well as the grand jury in Florida were about deceitful advertising,"" Richard Roberts, CEO of DraftDay Gaming Group, said.

America has put up with aggressive advertising blitzes before, though, and claiming some advertising is more misleading than others can be a tough distinction to make. All ads emphasize a product's strengths and downplay its weaknesses. Yet by the end of the DFS marketing blitz in late October, the backlash was intense. Why?

""I've personally never seen the volume of advertising like that; so fast, so much, so quickly,"" Stein said. ""And I think the quality of the content had a huge impact on the [reaction].""

Not gambling

It was an awkward moment in mid-February at the Fantasy Sports Trade Association winter conference in Dallas. Even the two professors presenting on stage knew it.

Dr. Brody Ruihley of the University of Cincinnati and Dr. Andrew Billings of the University of Alabama were sharing the results from a survey of around 500 people associated with the FSTA. Ruihley paced the stage and read off quotes from survey responders regarding daily fantasy.

""[I] enjoy the daily nature of the game, like being a general manager every day,"" Ruihley read.

The awkwardness came next.

""I don't like the fact that it isn't classified as gambling. It is,"" he recited. ""They need to stop that.""

Seventy percent of responders to Ruihley and Billings' survey said that when money is involved, fantasy sports are a form of gambling. Attorneys General in Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New York, Nevada and Vermont also have said DFS is a form of gambling. Problem gambling experts say DFS possesses the characteristics shown to cause the compulsive behaviors associated with gambling addiction. Opponents of gambling expansion also view DFS as a form of gambling, as do veteran gambling officials.

""I'm all for daily fantasy sports betting, just like I'm for other forms of sports betting,"" said Joe Asher, CEO of William Hill's Nevada sportsbook. ""I think they should be legal and regulated. But let's be real -- [it] is gambling and it should be regulated as such.""

Among those who have publicly said DFS is not a form of gambling: The sites that offer daily fantasy, the Fantasy Sports Trade Association and their investors, including Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. They also have some legal distinctions on their side; most notably, rulings that have concluded that entry fees into games of skill are not considered a bet or wager.

In a February ""Frontline"" report by PBS and The New York Times, a professional daily fantasy player said he was contacted by a representative of FanDuel, who requested he not associate their brand with ""gambling."" Over the summer, DraftKings made a similar request to comedian Bill Burr, asking him not to say it is a gambling website when reading promotional material. Editor's Picks Rodenberg: Four big issues facing the DFS industry in 2016 In an important year for daily fantasy, Ryan Rodenberg takes an in-depth look at four big issues surrounding the industry.

Yet while DraftKings has been trying to distance itself from gambling, it has also advertised at poker tournaments and horse races such as the Belmont Stakes, and according to Nevada Gaming Control chairman A.G. Burnett, its website's metadata was stuffed with gambling keywords. Both DraftKings and FanDuel have also applied for gambling licenses in the United Kingdom, where the laws classify daily fantasy sports as gambling. DraftKings has been granted its gambling license and recently launched operations in the U.K., while FanDuel's license request is still pending.

Legal counsel for the sites argue that whether or not DFS is gambling is not the true issue, and it may not be the deciding factor in the courtroom. But in the court of public opinion, each time a fantasy proponent goes out of the way to emphasize ""we're not gambling,"" the general public believes it's being misled.

""The sites, presumably for legal reasons, have had to posture as not being gambling,"" said Colin Drew, a 30-year-old avid DFS player and writer from Washington, D.C., who was the author of the original post in this fan forum discussing the Haskell controversy. ""I'm an advocate for all skill-based gaming (poker, DFS, sports betting), but think it rubs many the wrong way that the sites pretend that it is truly unique compared to those other games. I think anyone who plays DFS with any regularity believes it is skill-based gambling that should be legal.""

Fantasy sports proponents don't even want to be associated with traditional sports betting, a form of gambling that even the NFL and Department of Justice have said is also skill-based. Even so, the Fantasy Sports Trade Association is lobbying to get a clear distinction between fantasy sports and traditional sports betting. But is there one?

Daily fantasy sports proponents, including high-level executives like FanDuel CFO Matt King, have said they offer an entertainment product that's based on skill. During a recent phone interview, another daily fantasy executive attempted to explain the distinction they make between daily fantasy sports and traditional sports betting: ""I view that [DFS] is a game of skill that's around an entertainment product, where you have to understand, in-depth, the players across the board. You have to understand what the weather conditions are; who that player is up against. You have to understand injury reports.""

Sound familiar? Ask any high-level sport bettor their process in picking which teams to bet, and they'll tell you, in some form, that they examine players, weather conditions, matchups and injury reports. Certainly, there are nuances between how fantasy sports and traditional sports betting are played, but the core skill is exactly the same: You are attempting to predict the performance of athletes.

As long as daily fantasy operators continue to attempt to talk around that reality, they'll be facing an uphill battle against the public.

Asked in the ""Frontline"" interview whether his company offers gambling, King simply said, ""No.""

The media coverage

The original headline on The New York Times' report of the Haskell incident -- as well as reports from other media outlets -- included the term ""insider trading."" It wasn't up on the Times' website for long -- a few hours max -- before it was changed. But the damage had been done. The story in early October went viral -- rapidly.

It's challenging for any member of the media to cover a story about an unfamiliar subject, and much of the mainstream media scrambled to learn about DFS on the fly while covering a story that rose to national relevance overnight. Inevitably, some mistakes were made, which often painted the daily fantasy industry in a negative light.

""This is an easy industry to sensationalize,"" said Adam Krejcik, managing director at Eilers Research, a consulting firm that works closely with the gaming sector. ""There's the perception that [DFS] is this huge, huge Ponzi scheme ... it's 'Oh my God, this is a billion-dollar underground industry, with problem gamblers everywhere.' That's really, to me, that's sensationalism and truly not getting all the facts correct.""

The New York Times did a yearlong investigation into illegal sports betting in the U.S. The investigation was very thorough and featured a visit to an online sports betting book in Curacao. It also included DFS in the investigation.

""Even if you believe, as we don't, that DFS is gambling,"" Fantasy Sports Trade Association chairman Peter Schoenke said, ""it's a whole other level to equate us [with] an offshore sportsbook or the underground bookie on the street. There [are] definitely some issues here, definitely some difference of opinion, and that's all fair, but I felt like that one kind of crossed the line.""

The FSTA said it has been disappointed by the media coverage overall, claiming that corrections have not always been made upon request. Daily fantasy operators say they've been frustrated by outlets refusing to run statements the companies provided. One daily fantasy public relations executive said a reporter, when pushed for a correction, actually suggested that they should contact the attorney general's office.

On the same day the controversy surrounding Haskell erupted, the Times editorial board penned a piece titled, ""Rein In Online Fantasy Sports Gambling."" That message has been evident throughout the Times' coverage, which some say has been overly one-sided.

""One thing about the Times' reporting that does make me uncomfortable is the apparent conflation of daily fantasy sports sites and offshore sportsbooks,"" said Chris Grove, publisher of the influential industry site LegalSportsReport.com, who was also quoted in the ""Frontline"" feature. ""While I do believe DFS and sports betting share quite a bit of DNA ... it's deeply misleading to suggest -- even via topical proximity -- that a U.S.-based daily fantasy sports company is broadly similar to an offshore online sportsbook.""

Grove does question the validity of the accusations of unbalanced coverage, however.

""It's easy to complain that the balance of mainstream media coverage of daily fantasy sports has tipped overwhelmingly into the negative,"" he said. ""But that complaint misses the fact that there have been precious few positive developments for daily fantasy sports since October. And most of the developments that could be cited as positives are more mitigations or reversals of negative developments than truly positive developments.""

New York Times Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist Walt Bogdanich, one of the primary reporters in the sports betting and DFS investigation, said he approached the story like any other.

""Our approach is we report the news. We haven't been unfair, by the way,"" Bogdanich wrote in an email to ESPN. ""The issues we've raised are being echoed by attorneys general and legislators around the country. Were DFS commercials 'fair' when suggesting over and over that winning big was easy on DFS?""

It's been five months since the DFS ad blitz bombarded the airwaves. The ads were the gasoline, the Haskell controversy the match and the media coverage an added accelerant.

The venom directed at prominent DFS players has tempered, but several pros have been named in class-action suits, including Haskell, who still works at DraftKings and is attempting to move forward, along with the rest of the industry.

DraftKings and FanDuel are trying to survive courtroom battles long enough to allow legislation to be passed, clarifying fantasy sports' legal status, and approximately 20 states have introduced bills. But there's still a long battle ahead -- particularly in the court of public opinion.",[]

Now the Warriors are actually favored in Las Vegas to break the record.

The Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook opened the prop ""Will Golden State win 73 or more games in the 2015-16 regular season"" on Nov. 24, when Golden State was 15-0. At the time, the odds on the Warriors breaking the record (""yes"") were plus-500, while the odds on them falling short (""no"") were minus-700.

During the All-State break, Golden State became favored to break the record for the first time all season, at minus-160, with fewer than 73 wins at plus-140.

After a 118-112 victory Wednesday night over the Miami Heat to get to 51-5 on the season, the ""yes"" bet is currently minus-125, while ""no"" is plus-105. The win pushed the Warriors to the best 56-game start in NBA history. The Bulls were 50-6 through 56 games in 1995-96.

According to Jeff Sherman, the manager at the SuperBook, the prop has received considerable action. In an email, he said 75 percent of the tickets and 60 percent of the money has been wagered on Golden State to break the record.

The Cleveland Cavaliers opened as 9-4 favorites to win the title this year, with Golden State and the Oklahoma City Thunder at 5-1. The Warriors are now a 10-11 favorite to repeat, with the Cavaliers (11-4) and San Antonio Spurs (7-2) behind them.

Over 40 Kenyan athletes have tested positive for banned substances in the last five years.

Kiprop has won the 1500 metres at the last three World Championships and was also awarded Olympic gold at Beijing 2008 after Bahrain's Rashid Ramzi failed a drug test.

He told BBC Sport: ""It's a disgrace to the sport and to ourselves as champions.

""It's a disgrace to a hard-working athlete when an athlete is found to have used performance-enhancing drugs.""

Doping and corruption allegations have rocked athletics in recent months, with Russia currently banned from international competition and IAAF marketing consultant Papa Massata Diack -- the son of former president Lamine Diack -- former Russian athletics federation (ARAF) president and IAAF treasurer Valentin Balakhnichev and Alexei Melnikov, a senior ARAF coach, serving life bans.

The IAAF's ethics commission found the trio had blackmailed Russian runner Liliya Shobukhova and made her pay a bribe for a positive drugs test to be covered up.

Two of Kenya's banned athletes, Joy Sakari and Francisca Koki Manunga, claimed in a media report on Wednesday that they were asked for a payment of 2.5million Kenyan shillings (16,500) by an Athletics Kenya official for a reduction of their four-year sanctions.

A statement from World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) director general David Howman on Wednesday read: ""WADA is most disturbed by these reports regarding extortion and bribery at the national level of sport, eerily similar-sounding to what we learnt through the recent Independent Commission investigation into widespread doping in international athletics.

""The allegations we have heard this week also illustrate the importance of having a robust, independent national anti-doping organisation fully functional in Kenya at the earliest opportunity.

""This is a vital step for a country of Kenya's sporting stature to take if it is to effectively protect clean athletes.""

The head of Kenya's Olympic Committee, Kip Keino, said progress is being made on that front.

""Time is running out, but we are moving,"" he told BBC Sport. ""There is a change in this country. The government is committed. We saw what happened in other countries like Russia and we don't want that.""

Cabinet secretary Hassan Wario added: ""The cases we've had are individuals. We have clamped down.

""We can't compare to Russia at all. We haven't reached that because the government knows the importance of athletics to this nation.

LAS VEGAS -- Following the first loss of his UFC career -- a submission defeat to Nate Diaz at 170 pounds -- Conor McGregor is headed back to the featherweight division to defend his title, most likely on July 9 at UFC 200.

There are two potential opponents for him to face. Jose Aldo (25-2) was the longest reigning champion in featherweight history until McGregor knocked him out in 13 seconds in December. Frankie Edgar (20-4-1) is a former lightweight champion, riding a five-fight win streak at 145 pounds.

Edgar, 34, said he's optimistic he'll get the fight -- but it likely comes down to one thing.

""If he's got balls, he'll pick me,"" Edgar told ESPN.com. ""It's easier to go in there and fight a guy you know you handled, you know you beat. But if he wants to come back after that loss to Nate and prove the doubters wrong, silence these rumblings about his ground game? He'll fight me. If he beats me, no one can say anything. That would almost erase the loss to Nate.""

McGregor (19-3) has not indicated which matchup he prefers. Nor has the UFC. The defending featherweight champion seemed to lean toward a rematch against Aldo during the UFC 196 post-fight media conference, but said he's worried about Aldo's history of pulling out of fights.

""Frankie, at least he gets in there and competes,"" McGregor said.

Edgar has been waiting on the sidelines since his first-round knockout victory over Chad Mendes on Dec. 11. He said he has been frustrated by not only the time off, but also some of the praise McGregor has received for wanting to leave his weight class and challenge heavier opponents. Edgar did that for years -- to the point that UFC president Dana White publicly called for him to move down and face smaller opponents.

""Dana is trying to pad this kid, talking about him moving up two weight classes"" Edgar said. ""He fought a 155-pounder and decided not to cut weight. That's all that was. I've seen people ask me on social media, 'You think you can hang with him at 145 when he's fighting at 170?' I was the 155-pound champion while Nate was in that division. It's just nonsense.

""All of this, 'Oh, he's so courageous for trying to win a title outside of his natural weight class.' That's already been done -- by me -- and no one seems to talk about it.""

Edgar worked as a television analyst last weekend and had an opportunity to speak to White immediately after UFC 196. During a Fox post-fight show, Edgar asked White directly if he'd fight McGregor next. White was non-committal, replying, ""We'll see how this shakes out.""

In December, when Edgar knocked out Mendes in devastating fashion, White said at a post-fight media conference that performance would get Edgar ""whatever he wants."" Edgar said what has happened since has obviously been frustrating.

""The response I got from Dana after UFC 196 was the same response I've been getting since the Mendes fight,"" Edgar said. ""I just don't see how I'm not the clear choice. He told me, 'You get what you want' back in December. Well, I didn't get what I wanted. Now, McGregor is coming back to 145 and you're telling me I'm not getting what I want again? I think that's bulls---.""

Fighting out of Toms River, New Jersey, Edgar is currently dealing with a groin injury but guaranteed he would be ready by UFC 200 on July 9. Aldo, who trains out of Nova Uniao in Rio de Janeiro, immediately called out McGregor on social media following his loss. On Monday, McGregor's coach John Kavanagh told MMAFighting.com his first choice is an Aldo rematch but is open to either option.",[]

JUPITER, Fla. -- The all-time home run king, Barry Bonds, watched the New York Yankees-Miami Marlins game with his fellow Miami coaches while sitting on a padded folding chair outside the dugout Tuesday at Roger Dean Stadium. During an innings break, Bonds stood up and walked toward home plate to deliver a message to CC Sabathia, who had completed his first appearance since entering alcohol rehab in October.

Sabathia grew up near San Francisco as a big fan of Bonds. Sabathia would periodically talk with Bonds, and Bonds, according to Sabathia, took an interest in him. The two hadn't spoken in a while, but Bonds, like seemingly everyone in baseball, is rooting for Sabathia.

After Sabathia's two scoreless and hitless innings against the Marlins, Sabathia made the walk across the diamond from the Yankees dugout on the first base line to the locker room beyond the left-field wall. On the way there, near home plate, he was intercepted by Bonds, who offered a hug and a handshake.

CC Sabathia's velocity topped 89 miles per hour in his first Grapefruit League outing. AP Photo/Jeff Roberson

Bonds told Sabathia, ""Keep going. I'm checking up on you, and stay healthy.""

Sabathia, 35, looked pretty healthy his first time out. He is a finesse pitcher now, even if his $25 million salary is doled out for power. His mechanics were solid and consistent, which makes it seem likely that he could win the fifth spot, if an injury doesn't make Joe Girardi's decision for him.

A scout clocked Sabathia's fastball as high as 89 and said it ranged from 85 to 89 over his 25 pitches. Sabathia was able to strike out two batters -- Christian Yelich and Martin Prado -- while walking one.

""He was sharp,"" Yelich said. ""He had his cutter going and his slider. I only saw three pitches.""

It is impossible to accurately analyze such a short outing so early in the spring. The velocity might be in an expected range, considering he might add a mile or three by the end of the spring or with the adrenaline of the regular season.

Although Girardi likes to play down velocity when it suits his argument, every mile Sabathia adds will make his cutter and change that much more deceptive -- and that will be the main ingredient for his future success.

""Yeah, hes not a power guy anymore,"" Girardi said. ""He understands that.""

The alcohol issue is a demon Sabathia will fight for the rest of his life. He knows that too, but in this early stage, he does sound and look healthier.

On the mound, with a knee brace that made a huge difference in his results at the end of last season, Sabathia is making the Yankees feel more confident that he will hold up physically.

Regardless of expectations, the Yankees are designed to win a championship. Although Sabathia's track record will give him an advantage over Ivan Nova for the fifth spot, he will have to pitch well to keep it. This is not a regular spring training for him. He will be evaluated on his results.

""Youll look at his stuff,"" Girardi said. ""Youll look at the swings, youll look at his command. Is he in good counts? That sort of thing. Hitters really tell you what a guys stuff is. They really do by the contact that they make, so thats what you look at.""

In 25 pitches, 16 of which were strikes, Sabathia passed Tuesday -- which seems to be the preference of everyone in locker rooms across Florida and Arizona. From Bonds to the clubhouse attendants he treats with respect, Sabathia is well-liked. Tuesday was a small step that had even opponents rooting for him.",[]

The circumstances are different, as he is now 31 years old and coming off of a disappointing 2015 season.

Both OG and LGD Gaming are teams that mix individual mechanical prowess and fast adaptability with their cores, which makes for a lethal combination to plan against. LGD Gaming relies on the carry abilities of both Sylar and Maybe, while OG's Miracle- is one of the most individually gifted players in DOTA 2.

Newbee is a team with a mix of strong veterans -- Hao, Mu and ChuaN -- along with a couple of promising upstarts, but as a team, they lack a strong identity or strength in any particular area. Team Archon has an aggressive fighting lineup that incorporates unique drafts and relentless pressure.

OG vs. Team Archon

On paper, this was a mismatch -- a seasoned, tournament-successful team in OG, against a team of mix-and-match North American players in Team Archon. Even if the potential outcome seemed all but certain on paper, in reality it was a set of nonstop fighting, rotations and individual glory plays.

The first game felt like a never-ending fight, with both lineups doing a perpetual dance of death around the other. OG met Team Archon in several early-game rotations for a virtual stalemate into the midgame, but the difference was that OG left Miracle- out of the fights for free-farm. Miracle- would pay off immediately, with his radiance timing, and he impacted the next fights to such a degree that they would fall strongly into OG's favor -- including the first barracks before the 20-minute mark -- and the farm difference between carries would prove to be the tipping point for OG in a frenzied Game 1 victory.

Team Archon drafted a roaming Mirana for Game 2, and succeeded in grabbing an early-game kill lead. Between the highest net worth of Miracle- and the power-leveling of OG's support players Cr1t- and Fly, the lead the team built favored them despite Team Archon's higher kill total. Team Archon would consistently group up as four or five to pressure into the midgame, and kept the game close, but the difference would once again be Miracle-. His elusiveness, highest net total throughout the game and split-push allowed OG to hold off the assault of Team Archon's lineup and break the map -- and the game -- open. They would finally break the base, and the will, of Team Archon to claim the set.

LGD Gaming vs. Newbee

This was the hardest-to-predict set of the entire group, as both Chinese teams boasted strong individual star players -- LGD Gaming with Sylar and Maybe, and Newbee with Mu and Hao. As a result, it was the closest contest and the most compelling series for viewers on Day 3.

Even though both squads were constructed as two-lane phase teams, they fought early and often in a absolute stalemate. One rotation and momentum shift was immediately met with another, but LGD Gaming's two carries would pace the net worth charts. The swing in Game 1 came from the radiance pick-up from LGD Gaming's Sylar, which allowed his team the fight and map advantage. Newbee clawed back behind the play of Mu's Tiny, but the overall worth of the team was too far behind LGD Gaming's entire lineup.

Eventually the solo carry power of Mu was not enough for the well-rounded LGD Gaming cores, and every fight in the late game fell in their favor as the team sealed a Game 1 victory. Newbee drafted for a fighting lineup in Game 2, and it worked out well for them. After a drawn-out first game, Newbee rotated continuously to claim Game 2. Behind Tusk and Sven, Newbee grouped up often, for advantageous fight after advantageous fight. The entire 22-minute game was a slugfest, and Newbee's faster roster punished the greedy draft of LGD Gaming. Game 3 was the execution battle that most tuned in for from the start. Both teams fought and traded early, entering the midgame with neither lineup holding a noticeable edge. The farm war stalemate extended well past the 30-minute mark, with LGD Gaming's lineup grabbing a slight edge for the latter stages of the game. LGD Gaming drew the first-base damage, but Newbee stalled and responded to every blow thereafter to keep the game close. Both teams, utilizing great defensive spells and tactics, held and defended -- and it took a Newbee overextended chase to Sylar's Juggernaut for LGD Gaming to firmly grab hold of the game. Eventually, the better initiation of Earthshaker and the late game of LGD Gaming's lineup proved too strong for Newbee for the final game of the set, giving LGD the victory.

Team Archon vs. Newbee

This set was a chess match, putting a clash of styles on display. Newbee drafted to counter the play of Team Archon, while Team Archon attempted to build toward the execution game to match Newbee.

Newbee's carefully crafted lineup was a response to the abnormally aggressive play style of Team Archon, and the early game featured a series of teleports and failed kills. Team Archon still took the kill lead because of their superior mobility, but Newbee stuck around because of a better lane phase, keeping the game in a stalemate.

The solo carry power of Team Archon's Spectre was too weak against the tri-core setup of Newbee's Tiny, Sven and Dark Seer, and while it would take a late-game push and forced fight from Newbee, it would be enough to claim Game 1.

Game 2 started off in Team Archon's favor, in terms of map control and overall net worth, despite the numerous Newbee ganks. The game broke in Newbee's favor with an early team wipe at Minute 19, and their three-core set up the midgame in their favor. Newbee's Mu was the star of the midgame -- his Puck initiated winning fights, forced action and was a nightmare to deal with. Behind Puck's strong start, the carry Spectre would eventually snowball Newbee into the late game, and eventually end the Team Archon threat as they were sent out to the lower bracket with their second loss.

OG vs. LGD Gaming

This match between arguably the two best teams in the group was a matchup that many predicted, and star power was not lacking for either squad as Miracle- led OG and Sylar and Maybe anchored LGD Gaming. The winner of this set would automatically qualify for the upper bracket, while the loser would have to face off with Newbee for the second berth to the upper bracket.

What a wipeout of a first game. OG had everything working in its favor in the opening game -- a greedy lineup and better rotations -- and it helped the team to win the fights they had to, causing a blowout early game. Moon and N0tail shined in initiations and Miracle- put on another clinic in the carry game. Not much else to say, as it was 28-6.

At this point, the set slowed down into an execution war in Game 2. Despite the early rotations and team fights, it was all an act as both squads had an unspoken agreement to stay passive and farm. Neither team could crack the other with fights, and traded back each time almost immediately after the other team won one. OG led early with a tri-core of Broodmother, Juggernaut and Batrider against the duo-core of LGD Gaming's Sven and Lycan, but the stalemate was clearly reflected in both map control and the kill totals throughout the 30-40-minute mark.

Both teams respected the other's win conditions. For LGD Gaming, it was a superior area-of-effect team fight, and the subsequent push after it with Lycan and OG, who boasted pick-off kill potential and split-push power -- as did Miracle-. LGD Gaming eventually cracked through OG and caused the first big momentum shift around the 65-minute mark, with a fantastic fight and Roshan aegis grab, but OG employed smokes, ganks and pick-off to not only stall the game, but take the objective advantage.

OG would take the entire LGD Gaming base, except for the throne, but it couldn't quite close the game out. LGD Gaming took advantage of two small mistakes from OG, which snowballed into a base race and comeback to win a marathon Game 2.

In a pace departure, both teams executed early fights often to translate to fast objective pushes and Roshan takes in Game 3. The big advantage for OG was Miracle-, yet again, with a fast start and unimpeded farm and kills for his Slark. Despite the stalemate in map control and kill totals in the midgame, Miracle-'s Slark was the big gold monster and kept the game firmly in OG's control.

LGD Gaming picked off the rest of OG, but the gold lead from Slark and their Lone Druid proved too strong, despite the balanced totals from the Chinese team. By the 30-minute mark was all OG, as the entire team camped out at LGD Gaming's side of the map and forced multiple fights on the high ground, eventually breaking through the defenses and ending the game. The final fight, and the sudden end of the game, came just five minutes after the momentum and net worth were at a virtual stalemate.

LGD Gaming vs. Newbee

This rematch, with the higher stakes of an opportunity to advance into the upper bracket on the line, was exciting -- but when compared to the first Newbee-LGD Gaming set, it was a bit of a letdown. Newbee needed to adjust to prevent a double-jeopardy situation, but LGD Gaming was too experienced, relentless and strong in the end.

The fighting started early and often from LGD Gaming's side, in response to a push-oriented lineup from Newbee. With every winning fight, the response from the other side was swift. The downside to trading fights for Newbee was the lack of map control -- an effect of that pushing lineup -- and eventually Sylar's farm and LGD Gaming's team fighting setup proved too strong for Newbee's defenses.

The game eventually stalled when Newbee took the first barracks, but LGD Gaming prioritized team fighting over everything and overwhelmed Newbee behind the late-game power of Lone Druid. After a valiant defense into the late game, the team fight of LGD Gaming was just too strong and earned them a Game 1 victory.

Game 2 started slower than the first, as both teams kept the aggression to a minimum (in relation to the other games of the day), which allowed the carries to enjoy great farming in the lane phase. Behind Slark, LGD Gaming took the initiative and the first big lead, but Newbee stalled and traded throughout the midgame despite the farm deficit between the team's cores. LGD Gaming controlled the team fighting for the majority of the game, and broke the base with a final push and fight when Newbee Mu's Tiny was too late to the party.

Despite a valiant effort, Newbee was bound for the lower bracket.

In all, it was quite a Day 3, with a mix of blowouts, chess matches and snail-paced games. The group stages are not even over yet, and it's been quite a show during the first three days of the Shanghai Major -- and it's only going to get better from here.",[]

Phillies general manager Matt Klentak announced late Tuesday afternoon that Altherr would have surgery on Wednesday.

Altherr, 25, was a front-runner to be the starting right fielder on Opening Day.

""We're hopeful he'll be back before the end of the season,"" Klentak said.

Altherr suffered the injury last Friday when he dove for a ball. He went back to Philadelphia on Sunday and received two opinions, with both doctors recommending surgery. Dr. Randal Culp will perform the operation in Philadelphia.

""It's disappointing, certainly, for a young player who had a lot to prove,"" Klentak said. ""We were certainly excited to watch him play. But we're not going to sit here and feel sorry for ourselves. We have a lot of good players in camp that are competing really hard for an opportunity.""

Altherr hit .241 with five home runs and 11 doubles in 39 games with the Phillies at the end of last season.

To fill Altherr's void, Klentak said the Phillies will turn to several of the players competing for jobs in camp. Among them are Cody Asche, who shifted from third base to the outfield last May; Darnell Sweeney; Rule 5 pick Tyler Goeddel; and non-rosters players Cedric Hunter and David Lough.

""We owe it to the guys in camp to give them that chance to fill that spot,"" Klentak said. ""We'll survey the market. If there's something out there, we'll explore it. But we feel pretty good about the guys we have here.""",[]

The NHL trade deadline has come and gone (although you wouldn't know it with how uneventful it was), and those teams jockeying for playoff position have about 20 regular season contests left to do lock down a playoff spot. Editor's Picks Chalk: Latest futures odds ESPN Chalk presents the latest futures odds from the Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook in a variety of sports.

The defending champion Chicago Blackhawks are still the favorites in Vegas to once again raise the Stanley Cup, but the rest of the pack has shuffled quite a bit since 2016 Cup odds opened on June 14, 2015. With the deadline in the rearview mirror, the Cup contenders are becoming clearer, but it is still early enough to make the most of some fantastic value bets.

Hopefully, you took our preseason advice and have a couple of valuable tickets in your pocket, but if you didn't, here are some of our best value bets right now.

The favorites

Chicago Blackhawks (7-2)

espn.com,,Reaction to Team Sweden World Cup roster,"['Pierre Lebrun', 'Dan Marrazza', 'Joe Mcdonald', 'Sean Allen', 'John Buccigross', 'Sarah Goldstein', 'Scott Burnside', 'John Rosengren', 'Paul Grant']","TARRYTOWN, N.Y. -- Building off the team's silver medal at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Sweden has a chance to make some noise at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey.

Sweden's blueprint for success starts with New York Rangers goaltender Henrik Lundqvist. The 34-year-old veteran posted a 5-1-0 record, 1.50 goals-against average and .943 save percentage at the 2014 Olympics. His 12 victories ranks second all time in Olympic competition behind Vladislav Tretiak, who recorded 17 for the Soviet Union.

""The goal and the mindset going into this is to win -- there's no question,"" Lundqvist said. ""I think we have the team for it, but when it comes down to only a couple of games, you obviously need everything to work for you right away, and special teams play a big part. Looking at the team, it's going to be a tough challenge, no question, but the goal and mindset is to win.""

The forward position is another strength for Sweden, as they are stacked with offensive threats in the Vancouver Canucks' Daniel Sedin and Henrik Sedin, the Washington Capitals' Nicklas Backstrom, the Boston Bruins' Loui Eriksson, the Nashville Predators' Filip Forsberg, the Colorado Avalanche's Gabriel Landeskog, the St. Louis Blues' Alexander Steen and the Detroit Red Wings' Henrik Zetterberg.

Editor's Picks World Cup of Hockey roster: Team Sweden With the Swedes, it all starts with the King, but they also have a pretty deep D and some talented forwards up front.

Some later additions at forward could include Colorado's Carl Soderberg and Chicago's Marcus Kruger. The Penguins' Carl Hagelin could be possibility, too.

Sweden's ability to contribute offensively from its back end is another strong suit. Two-time Norris Trophy winner Erik Karlsson is a contender to win the top defensive award again this season. The Tampa Bay Lightning's Victor Hedman, who was surprisingly left off Sweden's roster for the 2014 Olympics, has Norris Trophy potential in his future and was a big reason the Lightning advanced to the Stanley Cup finals last June. It also helps that his defensive partner Anton Stralman made the cut.

A bit of a surprise, however, was the omission of 23-year-old defenseman John Klingberg. He's had another strong season for the Dallas Stars. Maybe this is a motivational factor for him.

""We have a great generation coming up here of guys born in the '90s and he's definitely one of those players,"" coach Rikard Gronborg said. ""He's played great minutes in Dallas. He played his first World Championship last year with us, so that's definitely a notch in his belt. Seeing him in the Stanley Cup [playoffs] is going to be important for us also to evaluate him as well as other players.""
