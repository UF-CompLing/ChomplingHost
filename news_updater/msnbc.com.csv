msnbc.com,,AG Loretta Lynch asks 'not to be considered' for Supreme Court,['Pete Williams'],"U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch has asked not to be considered for nomination to the Supreme Court to take the spot formerly occupied by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, the Justice Department said Tuesday.

Administration insiders had concluded more than a week ago that Lynchs nomination would create an opening for Senate Republicans to demand Justice Department documents on pending investigations, and it was therefore considered a non-starter.

Lynch had been among the names floated by observers as potential nominees. Scalia, the influential conservative, died in Texas on Feb. 13.

Senate Republicans have vowed to block anyone President Obama chooses, saying the next president should choose the next Supreme Court justice.

As the conversation around the Supreme Court vacancy progressed, the Attorney General determined that the limitations inherent in the nomination process would curtail her effectiveness in her current role, the Justice Department said in a statement.

Given the urgent issues before the Department of Justice, she asked not to be considered for the position. While she is deeply grateful for the support and good wishes of all those who suggested her as a potential nominee, she is honored to serve as Attorney General, and she is fully committed to carrying out the work of the Department of Justice for the remainder of her term.

msnbc.com,,The missing details from Bernie Sanders' general-election pitch,[],"In Sunday nights debate, Anderson Cooper asked Bernie Sanders about how hed approach a general-election match-up against Donald Trump. The Vermont senator didnt have to think much about the answer

I would love to run against Donald Trump, and Ill tell you why. For a start, almost, not all, but almost every poll has shown that Sanders vs. Trump does a lot better than Clinton vs. Trump. Right here in Michigan there was a poll done, I think yesterday, or today, had me beating Trump in Michigan by 22 points. Secretary Clinton beat him as well, but not by so much. And, thats true nationally, and in many other states.

Theres simply no denying the accuracy of Sanders boast. The polling data is publicly available, and most of it looks exactly the way the senator described it: both of the Democratic candidates lead Trump in a hypothetical general election, but Sanders advantage is larger.

Just yesterday, the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll reinforced the thesis with national results that showed Clinton leading Trump by 13 points, but Sanders ahead by 18 points. The latest Washington Post/ABC News poll showed similar results. So did the most recent national USA Today/Suffolk poll . So did the most recent national Quinnipiac poll

If one or two of these showed outlier results, itd be easier to question the reliability of the numbers, but when theres polling unanimity, the observation is much tougher to question.

And so, Sanders and his supporters point to these polls, loudly and repeatedly, as a way of deflecting questions about the Independent senators electability. And really, who can blame them? Most voters are reluctant to throw away a vote on a candidate whos bound to lose, and the Vermonter and his campaign allies appear to have quantifiable proof that hes a safe choice perhaps even the safer choice.

But some caveats are in order. The problem isnt that Sanders argument is wrong  the data clearly backs him up  but rather, that the argument is incomplete in a broader context.

For example, while general-election polling at this stage is interesting for establishing baselines, its also unreliable. Vox published a piece last week pointing to the available political-science research.

In an interview, [Robert S. Erikson] told me that general election polling from this time of year is pretty meaningless, and said he was surprised his work had been cited to argue for Sanderss general election chances. Bernie can look good in some polls, but I dont think anyone who follows politics thinks those would hold in November, Erikson said. It is for this reason that some, like Seth McKee, a political science professor at Texas Tech University, regard such early polls as absolutely worthless. Relatively few voters have made up their minds this long before the election, McKee says.

Even if you put this aside and take the early polling very seriously, there are other areas of concern. Revisiting our discussion from a couple of months ago, Hillary Clinton has been a high-profile national figure for many years, and her public reputation has been shaped in part by attacks from Republicans whove hated her, on a professional level, for the better part of a quarter-century.

Sanders, in contrast, has never sought national office and has never been subjected to the full weight of the GOP Attack Machine, in part because his re-election bids in Vermont have been so easy. Indeed, much of the public, which is not yet engaged in the presidential campaign, probably has very little idea about who the senator is and what he believes.

And so the question for Democrats is not just which candidate has a poll advantage now, but also which candidate seems likely to withstand the onslaught of attacks that would inevitably come in the fall.

Sanders obviously wants voters to believe hes that candidate. It is, however, a speculative question  no one can say with certainty whether or not hes correct. That said, e xperts can make educated projections. GW political scientist John Sides noted last month that Sanders views and ideology creates the risk of a penalty at the ballot box.

He highlighted a Gallup report published last summer that asked Americans, without mentioning any candidates names, whether voters would be comfortable with different kinds of presidential candidates. For example, 93% of Americans said theyre fine with voting for a Roman Catholic, and 92% of voters are on board with supporting a woman.

Further down the list, just 60% said they could vote for a Muslim, and atheists did a little worse, at 58%.

Socialists, however, finished dead last at 47%  the only group that finished below 50%.",[]

Why did you get involved in student government?

I got involved in student government in college because I wanted the opportunity to hit the ground running and understand more about my campus. I have always been a natural problem solver and the Student Assembly gave me the opportunity assist my peers grappling with campus issues. It really has evolved into a platform to voice student concerns and shape the future direction of Cornell.

Do you plan to vote in the primary and/or November presidential elections this year?

Yes! Voting is vital to the American democratic process. I dont vote unless I am informed: so I stay abreast of news outlets and try to develop my own opinion.

Have you ever been in a protest? If so, how was it and how has it affected your leadership work?

I have been involved in a protest at Cornell around the student health fee and the viability of shared governance. It opened my eyes to the importance of smart activism, where protesters use existing structure in a respectful way to intelligently get their point across. Generating attention for a cause you are passionate about can sometimes be a constructive supplement to going through typical channels.

Has feminism played a role in your life? If so, how?

I am a proud feminist. Gender inequality still exists and I really think that womens rights should be on everyones radar. I dont think gender should be used as an insult or a reason to treat a person as inferior. Its that simple. Understanding feminism has made me look at the world through a different lens, being conscious of the inherent divides and subconscious biases we hold.

If you could be any social media platform, which one would you be and why?

I would be Snapchat because it captures moments from people lives in raw and genuine ways.

msnbc.com,,"Iraq suicide attack: 47 dead, dozens injured in blast south of Baghdad",['Associated Press'],"BAGHDAD  A suicide bomber on Sunday rammed his explosives-laden fuel truck into a security checkpoint south of Baghdad, killing at least 47 people and wounding dozens, officials said, the latest episode in an uptick in violence in the war-ravaged country.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which bore the hallmarks of an ISIS attack. The militant group and other Sunni militants frequently use car bombs and suicide attacks to target public areas and government buildings in their bid to undermine confidence in the Shiite-led government in Baghdad.

Among the dead were 39 civilians, while the rest were members of the security forces. The attacker struck shortly after noon when the checkpoint at one of the entrances to the city of Hillah was crowded with dozens of cars, a police officer said.

He added that up to 65 other people were wounded and nearly 50 cars were damaged. Hillah is located about 60 miles south of Baghdad.

A medical official confirmed the causality figures. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release information.

Iraq has seen a spike in violence in the past month with suicide attacks in and outside Baghdad, all claimed by the ISIS, killing more than 170 people. ISIS controls large swaths of Iraq and neighboring Syria and has declared an Islamic caliphate on the territory it holds.

According to United Nations figures, at least 670 Iraqis were killed last month due to ongoing violence, of whom about two-thirds were civilians.

In the absence of special measures to screen for infection or reduce pathogens, the risk of Zika virus transmission through blood products is considered likely based on the most current scientific evidence of how Zika virus and similar viruses (flaviviruses) are spread, and what is currently being reported about transfusion-associated infection occurring outside of the United States, HHS said in a statement.

msnbc.com,,Senate Republicans rediscover the value of 'Pinata Politics',[],"Almost exactly 10 years ago, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) was concerned about Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito facing attacks from Senate Democrats. Eventually, the Texas Republican said at the time , senators will need to come to terms with our confirmation process. Cornyn added that treating nominees more like pinatas than human beings is something none of us should be willing to tolerate.

That was when there was a Republican president in the White House. Now that President Obama is the one doing the nominating, Cornyn is apparently less concerned about Pinata Politics.

Even though Senate Republicans have no intention of holding hearings on President Barack Obamas Supreme Court nominee, that doesnt mean he or she wont be dragged through the mud. And the chambers No. 2 Republican made that clear to a small cluster of reporters Monday, saying he believed the nominee, will bear some resemblance to a pinata.

A decade ago, Cornyn characterized this as something none of us should be willing to tolerate, but this year, one gets the impression that the Senate Majority Whip not only tolerates the same practices he denounced. he also intends to be one of the lawmakers holding the stick, swinging for candy.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was unimpressed with the rhetoric. Senator Cornyn has now taken the next step and suggested  without knowing who this nominee is, without considering what their record is, what their experience is, how qualified they are for the job  he is suggesting that theyll be subjected to bashing by Republicans, Earnest told reporters yesterday. Its unclear for what reason, other than the president of the United States has chosen to fulfill his constitutional responsibility to nominate someone to fill a vacancy.

That said, if Cornyn and the GOPs tolerance for Pinata Politics is intended to intimidate potential nominees  Its a nice career you have there, itd be a shame if we had to beat you with a stick  it might be working.

Nevada Gov. Brian Sandovals (R) was floated as a possible choice for the Supreme Court, though he soon after withdrew his name from consideration. Yesterday, as MSNBC reported , a high-profile member of the presidents cabinet did the same thing.

U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch has asked not to be considered for nomination to the Supreme Court to take the spot formerly occupied by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, the Justice Department said Tuesday.

Today, The Hill reported that another possible contender also bowed out.

msnbc.com,,Sanders' surprise win and Clinton's defeat: What happened in Michigan?,[],"NBC News Kristen Welker, Kasie Hunt, Monica Alba, and Danny Freeman contributed reporting.

Theres no such thing as a sure bet in politics, but Michigan certainly seemed like one for Hillary Clinton. The Real Clear Politics average of recent polls had her up by more than 21 points on Election Day, and the data whizzes at FiveThirtyEight gave her a 99 percent chance of winning the race. (After Sanders won, they also called it one of the greatest upsets in modern political history.)

Even the Sanders campaign was bracing for defeat, and spent Tuesday pre-spinning a loss while the Clinton campaign gained little traction arguing the race was closer than expected.

RELATED: Michigan win rescues Bernie Sanders campaign

When exhausted Sanders staffers reached their hotel in Miami Tuesday night, they were stunned to find their candidate ahead in early returns and scrambled to assemble a podium so he could address the press. As Clinton gave a speech in Cleveland that did not mention Michigan, seemingly frustrated aides focused on Clintons large net delegate win in Mississippi, which held a primary on the same day.

So what happened? Both campaigns are still picking over the wreckage for clues, but heres what we know so far about how Sanders net an unexpected victory.

Sanders went all in, Clinton took her eye off the ball: Clinton seemed to take Michigan for granted after a string of big wins, leading her to begin turning to the general election. Team Sanders, meanwhile, saw Michigan as a must-win and invested accordingly. They outspent Clinton by about $500,000 on TV and spent almost three times as much on radio ads in the final week of the campaign as they had during any week in any state up to now.

Sanders brass deployed two veteran operatives  Robert Becker, who ran Sanders campaign in Iowa, and Julia Barnes, who ran his New Hampshire campaign  to help organize the state, and built a robust ground operation.

Clinton invested less heavily in her field program, which largely focused on African-Americans. Some supporters worried when they saw few Clinton yard signs, and some volunteers grumbled about disorganization and under-resourcing, but the realization of a major problem didnt come soon enough.

In closing days, the campaign scrambled to bring in reinforcements. They redirected Bill and Chelsea Clinton to spend more time in the state, and called on Michigan allies to rally troops. But it was too little, too late.

On a conference call with reporters Wednesday, Clintons campaign manager Robby Mook pushed back on that notion. Were proud of the ground game we ran, he said.

Geography: Clinton spent virtually all of her time in Detroit, along with a church visit in Flint last month and a small visit to a software company in Grand Rapids. Bill and Chelsea Clinton hit other parts of the state in the final push, but the candidate herself didnt hold any public rallies outside of Detroit during the entire campaign.

RELATED: Ghetto gaffe highlights Sanders campaigns struggle with race

While Clinton focused on population centers, Sanders allies said the candidate and his team did a better job of activating voters across the state. He won 73 of Michigans 83 counties (though Clinton won the most populous ones), and ran up large margins in counties that include Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor.

Despite making Flint the soul of her Michigan campaign, Clinton didnt hold a single open event in the city during her five days in the state leading up to Tuesday. She also did not attend the watch party her campaign organized after Sundays debate in Flint, as she has in other states, disappointing some attendees.

Inroads with African-American voters: African-Americans have been determinative of the Democratic primary so far, and may have been in Michigan, too. Clinton was once again banking on black voters, but Sanders performed better with that group in Michigan than he did in the South. He still lost black votes 68 to 38, but thats 20 points better than he did with that voting bloc in Mississippi. They also made up a slightly smaller proportion of the vote than expected.

Sanders core supporters turned out big: Young people, Sanders most important voting bloc, turned out in larger-than-expected numbers, with those younger than 30 making up the same portion of the electorate as those older than 65. Sanders visited every college town in the state, turning out huge crowds when he did, which the campaign says proves their point that they can move the needle anywhere they move their candidate.

And Sanders did better than usual among those slightly older, winning 53 percent of those between the ages of 30 and 44.

Michigans open primary allows independents to vote in either party, and Sanders always does well among among independents. He performed even better than expected with that group on Tuesday, winning 71 percent of independents casting ballots in the Democratic primary.

Some speculate that Clinton supporters were complacent and stayed home, or possibly even voted in the Republican primary in an attempt to stop Trump.

The weather: It was an unseasonably warm 70 degrees in much of the state on Election Day, helping to push up turnout in both partys primaries to record levels. More than 2.5 million voters participated in the Republican and Democratic primaries, shattering the record of 1.93 million set in the 1972 primary and the expected 2 million turnout.

Fertile ground for Sanders message: Late-deciders broke for Sanders and most pollsters had stopped contacting voters on Sunday. Michigan was a perfect place for Sanders message because of its Rust Belt history and relatively friendly demographics. His emphasis on unpopular free trade deals and his performance in Sunday nights debate, while panned by some analysts, could have changed minds.

The Sanders campaign also believes Clintons charge (which they called misleading and unfair) that he voted against the auto bailout backfired. The auto rescue was included in the Wall Street bailout bill, which Sanders voted against, and they believe hitting on him on the issue played into the idea that she is dishonest and reminded voters of Wall Street. Mook rejected that claim outright. Well continue to talk about it, he said.",[]

As has been often noted, Trump is a celebrity  and he boasts a fair amount of star supporters for a Republican candidate. Still, the quality of his endorsers may not always match the quantity.

RELATED: But what about the children, Mr. Trump?

Here are a few of the less-than-illustrious celebrities who have backed his presidential bid:

Mike Tyson - The former heavyweight champion turned comedic actor (and cartoon character), who has been friendly with Trump for decades, made the case that the real estate mogul should be president last fall. Lets try something new. Lets run America like a business, where no colors matter, he told The Huffington Post. He also had no problem with Trumps controversial rhetoric about Latinos and other ethnic groups, saying: Hes an average guy like everybody else.

Gary Busey - The eccentric character actor, whose past battles with addiction have been well-documented, said I know him personally. I know him professionally. Hes a great guy. Hes sharp. Hes fast. He can change the country after the last eight years during an appearance on Fox News in September. The Point Break actor appeared on two editions of Trumps reality TV show Celebrity Apprentice, and the GOP candidate once joked that hed make a good Supreme Court justice.

Omarosa Manigault - Speaking of The Apprentice, the biggest breakout star of that franchise had also thrown her weight behind The Donald. Despite being a Democrat who once worked in the Clinton White House, Manigault appeared alongside Trump and a group of black ministers last December and declared: Donald Trump is committed to the black community. Manigault, who has now become an ordained minister, later told talk show host Steve Harvey: I know him as a friend, as a mentor, as a father. 

Tila Tequila - Another reality TV show star and frequent source of tabloid fodder, endorsed Trump on YouTube because of his anti-vaccination positions. In case you forgot, three years ago Tequila lit a social media firestorm after expressing an affinity for Adolf Hitler as well as posting an image of herself holding a gun in front of a backdrop of the World War II concentration camp Auschwitz. She has also alleged that actor Paul Walker was ritualistically murdered.

Hulk Hogan - Although the wrestling icon  and current litigant in a high profile case against Gawker  has endorsed President Barack Obama in the past, this year he is all in with Trump. In fact, last summer he volunteered to be the real estate moguls running mate. But it remains to be seen whether Trump should want Hogans endorsement. After all, audio from a leaked sex tape featuring the aging wrestler reportedly shows him spewing racist invective and using the N-word.

Jon Voight - The Oscar winning actor, who was a liberal at the height of his career in the 1970s, has since morphed into one of Obamas harshest critics in Hollywood. He has accused the president of causing a civil war and tearing the country apart, frequently singling out his handling of Israel for attack. The Midnight Cowboy actor once penned an open letter to the president in which he said Obama promoted anti-Semitism throughout the world.  In a self-released video which came out this month last year, Voight claimed: President Obama does not love Israel. His whole agenda is to control Israel, he said in a self-released video this month last year. On Wednesday, Voight told Breitbart News, regarding Trump: Hes an answer to our problems. We need to get behind him.

Willie Robertson - One of the members of the Duck Dynasty reality TV show family, Willie Robertson came out in support of Trump in January. His father, who famously was suspended from the show for a homophobic tirade, has backed Sen. Ted Cruz. Willie Roberston has said in the past that hes trying to figure out if being gay is a choice. Heres the deal. Were both successful businessmen. We both have pretty big shows on television. We both have wives that are 1,000 times better looking than us, so I like Trump, he said earlier last year.

Stephen Baldwin - The veteran character actor is another former Celebrity Apprentice contestant  notice a pattern here. He has claimed in the past that his far right politics  which put him odds with some of his famous brothers  has cost him roles in Hollywood, and in recent years he has been more prominent as a religious conservative than a working actor. On Trump hes said: I think hes fantastic. I love him. I think hed make a great president. Hes not a politician, and he doesnt care what anybody thinks. And thats why hes surging in the polls. He says what he thinks.



Jesse James - This endorser combines several elements of the prototypical celebrity Trump endorser. Hes a former Celebrity Apprentice contestant. He was a reality star in his own right prior to that (thanks to his now defunct bodyshop shows). And he too was caught up in a very public scandal involving racial insensitivity. In the aftermath of his ugly split with former wife actress Sandra Bullock, a photo of James dressed in Nazi regalia while doing the infamous Heil Hitler salute was unearthed. James later called his participation in the picture a joke. On Trump, hes said: This guy is the real deal, and will make America great again.



Kid Rock - The Detroit-based rock-rapper, who has been pilloried for brandishing the Confederate flag at his concerts in the past, has been very public about his support for GOP candidates previously. They say Obama is lyin/ Thats why Im voting for Romney and Ryan, he rapped in 2012. He told Rolling Stone last month: Im digging Trump. I feel like a lot of people, whether youre a Democrat or a Republican, feel like if you get Hillary or Bernie, or you get Rubio or Cruz or whoever, theres going to be the same sh*t.



Dennis Rodman - The NBA Hall of Famer, who nearly caused an international incident when he cozied up to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in 2013, has made no secret of his distaste for President Obama. And, you guessed it, he too was a contestant on Trumps popular reality TV series Celebrity Apprentice. Trump was one of the few prominent figures to praise Rodmans North Korea trip and the TK-NBA champion returned the favor by endorsing the real estate mogul early, tweeting in July: @realDonaldTrump has been a great friend for many years. We dont need another politician, we need a businessman like Mr. Trump! Trump 2016.

Ted Nugent - The virulently pro-gun rock musician has called President Obama a subhuman mongrel and his supporters pimps, whores and welfare brats. He has argued that African-Americans have a mindless propensity towards violence and suggested that the late Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teen shot and killed in 2012, got justice. Still, the one thing that appears to be brightening his disposition is the candidacy of Trump. He would kick a** and take names, and thats what America needs right now, Nugent said during an appearance on The Rita Cosby Show last July.

Honorable mention: Tom Brady - The NFL superstar, who spent much of last off-season battling accusations that he had sought an illegal advantage through the use of deflated footballs, has not endorsed Trump, but hes not not endorsed him either. The polarizing New England Patriots quarterback has been playing footsie with the Trump campaign for months. He was caught with Make America Great Again swag and has praised Trump repeatedly.

But with its competitors raising their bottom wages as well, that was no longer enough. On an earnings call, chief executive Robert Galanti explained that Costco reviews its payscale every three years, and usually raises just the top end  which right now is about $22.50. This year, they were boosting the floor as well, by $1.50, to $13.

Vox had a good piece last year, after Wal-Mart made a related announcement, noting that developments like these signal that companies want to keep attracting good talent and keep its workforce from departing to competitors, which in turn signals that theres increased competition to get good workers.

The actual job numbers have been very encouraging of late, and every time companies like Costco raise their wages, its further evidence of a healthy labor market.

I realize, of course, that conservative readers are very likely pointing to this as proof of the free market working: congressional Republicans refuse to consider even a modest increase in the federal minimum wage, but in practical terms, the argument goes, it doesnt much matter since private employers are making these decisions on their own based on the business cycle.

And while this is a nice argument, lets not forget that plenty of American workers arent employed by one of the companies that have voluntarily approved an increase, which means those other folks are being left behind. For that matter, lets also remember that without legal guarantees, the whims of the market may lead to reduced wages the next time theres an economic downturn.

In other words, the case for a federal increase hasnt really changed.",[]

msnbc.com,,"Elizabeth Garrett, Cornell's first female president, dies of colon cancer",['Elizabeth Chuck'],"Cornell University President Elizabeth Garrett has died from colon cancer, the university said, less than a month after announcing her diagnosis and just eight months after she assumed her post. She was 52.

Garrett, the first female president of the Ivy League school, died Sunday night at her home in New York City, Cornell said.

There are few words to express the enormity of this loss, Robert Harrison, chairman of the Cornell board of trustees, said on Monday. Beth was simply a remarkable human being  a vibrant and passionate leader who devoted her life to the pursuit of knowledge and public service.

Garrett started as president on July 1, 2015, and was inaugurated last September. She revealed on Feb. 8 that she had recently been diagnosed with cancer, and had surgery on Feb. 19 before starting aggressive treatment at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.

The university said she is the first president to die in office there.

Garrett made a strong impression on academics and politicians alike. Prior to becoming Cornells president, she was a provost and senior vice president for academic affairs at the University of Southern California  the first woman to hold that title, too.

In 2005, President George W. Bush appointed her to serve on the bipartisan Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform. From 2009 to 2013, she was commissioner of the California Fair Political Practices Commission.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called her a visionary leader in a statement Monday.

Elizabeths passing is a great loss not only for her university, but for our state, he said.

Garrett focused on attracting top faculty to Cornell during her short tenure, saying last October that the university was on track to hire up to 100 new faculty members this school year.

An Oklahoma City native who got her bachelors degree from the University of Oklahoma and a law degree from the Virginia School of Law, Garrett was once a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She told Times Higher Education magazine in 2014 she hoped to be a role model for young people.

Being the first woman president of Cornell, just as I was the first woman provost at U.S.C., puts me in the position of being a role model  not just for young women, but also for men, she said. It is important for women and men to see strong and capable women in positions of leadership, so we understand that certain characteristics such as gender and race do not determine how well people do in those offices. Garrett was married to Andrei Marmor, a Cornell professor of law. The university held a moment of silence for her Monday afternoon.",[]

msnbc.com,,#WachowskiSisters: Second member of 'Matrix' directing duo comes out as trans,[],"On Tuesday, the filmmaker formerly known as Andy Wachowski announced to the world via a statement to the Windy City News that she is transgender and will be using the first name Lily from now on.

She is the second member of the sibling directing duo  formerly known as the Wachowski brothers  to come out as transgender. Lana Wachowski made her public debut as trans in 2012. The directors, best known for the blockbuster Matrix trilogy, now arguably represent the most famous trans figures behind the camera in Hollywood.

Second Wachowski sibling comes out as transgender https://t.co/vVn5ToEZZ6 pic.twitter.com/BabuDJAMi7  Variety (@Variety) March 9, 2016

The 48-year-old Lilly told the Windy City News that the decision to go public now was an attempt to get in front of media outlets telling her story before she could.  SEX CHANGE SHOCKERWACHOWSKI BROTHERS NOW SISTERS!!! Theres the headline Ive been waiting for this past year. Up until now with dread and/or eye rolling exasperation, Lilly Wachowski wrote. The news has almost come out a couple of times. Each was preceded by an ominous email from my agentreporters have been asking for statements regarding the Andy Wachowski gender transition story they were about to publish. In response to this threatened public outing against my will, I had a prepared a statement that was one part piss, one part vinegar and 12 parts gasoline.

RELATED: Study: Film industry still a straight, white, boys club

But when publications didnt out her after all, she held back. Then on Monday night, according to Wachowski, she was confronted by a reporter claiming to be with the UK gossip publication The Daily Mail. Wachowski alleges that the writer pleaded with her to give him an interview about her gender status. Wachowski recalled that the publication had demonized Lucy Meadows, a British elementary school teacher who happened to be trans, in 2013. Three months after The Daily Mail published a column about Meadows titled, Hes not only trapped in the wrong body ... hes in the wrong job, she committed suicide.

A spokesman for The Daily Mail has denied in an official statement that they in any way tried to coerce Lily Wachowski into revealing her gender transition and insisted that their reporter was extremely sympathetic and courteous at all times. Dear Lily Wachowski: Sorry your trans-ness warranted tabloid threats, but welcome to the sisterhood! https://t.co/UODZvO9aID #girlslikeus  Janet Mock (@janetmock) March 9, 2016

I am one of the lucky ones. Having the support of my family and the means to afford doctors and therapists has given me the chance to actually survive this process, wrote Wachowski. And so, in part because she believes her coming out can combat the notion that trans people are predators, she decided to go public.

Im out to my friends and family. Most people at work know too. Everyone is cool with it. Yes, thanks to my fabulous sister theyve done it before, but also because theyre fantastic people. Without the love and support of my wife and friends and family I would not be where I am today, she wrote.

Her statement has inspired an outpouring of support on social media, and has been hailed as a significant landmark for an industry that has been recently exposed as incredibly deficient when it comes to LGBT representation both on camera and in leadership roles. A recent University of Southern California study found that seven or less than 1 percent  of 11,194 characters in 414 movies, television shows and digital series that they monitored were identified as transgender, and four of the characters came from a single show.

And as Vox has pointed out, the Wachowski sisters films have shown a willingness to portray gender fluidity (2012s Cloud Atlas) and LGBT relationships (1996s Bound) in unconventional narratives. Even the duos most famous work is filled with allusions to identity being a construct, wrote Todd VanDerWerff. The Matrix trilogy is full of characters who are one thing in reality, but quite another within the computer simulation of the matrix, to say nothing of the way that the reality of the computer simulation gives way to something else once you realize the truth.

My reality is that Ive been transitioning and will continue to transition all of my life, through the infinite that exists between male and female as it does in the infinite between the binary of zero and one, wrote Wachowski. We need to elevate the dialogue beyond the simplicity of binary. Binary is a false idol.",[]
msnbc.com,,"How Trump, Rubio and Cruz would fare against Clinton in November",[],"Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders would handily defeat Donald Trump in a general election match-up, while a clash between Clinton and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio would be a toss-up, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.

The poll shows that Trump, who frequently boasts in interviews and campaign appearances that he would beat Clinton in November, would lose a one-on-one contest against her by double digits. In a head-to-head fight, Clinton gets the support of 51 percent of registered voters compared to 38 percent for the real estate mogul.

For Sanders, the margin of victory would be even greater, the poll shows.

The Vermont senator gets 55 percent support in a hypothetical two-person race against Trump, while the GOP front-runner would get just 37 percent.

While Trump remains the front-runner for the GOP nomination, Republicans like former presidential contender Mitt Romney have urged their partys voters to back Cruz or Rubio, whom they say would have a greater chance of defeating the Democratic nominee.

The NBC/WSJ data supports that theory; both Cruz and Rubio would be competitive with the former secretary of state, both running within the margin of error in hypothetical general election battles against Clinton.

In a matchup with Cruz, Clinton would receive the support of 47 percent of registered voters, compared to 45 percent for the Texas senator.

If pitted against Rubio, Clinton and the Florida would tie at 46 percent support apiece, the poll shows.

The poll also shows that voters are split over whether they would consider a third party candidate in the presidential contest.

Forty-six percent of voters surveyed said that they would consider a third-party or independent candidate, while 51 percent said they would not consider it.

On Monday, the most prominent potential independent candidate, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, shut the door on a 2016 run, saying that he feared his inclusion in the race would ultimately help Trump win the presidency over the Democratic nominee.",[]

msnbc.com,,Bill Gates: Apple could propose a balance in FBI dispute,['Matthew Deluca'],"Bill Gates answered some questions about Apples ongoing dispute with the FBI during a Reddit Ask Me Anything on Tuesday  and stuck solidly to the same neutral position hes maintained in earlier comments.

I think there needs to be a discussion about when the government should be able to gather information, Gates said in response to one Redditors question. What if we had never had wiretapping? Also the government needs to talk openly about safeguards.

Im hard at work on my latest @reddit_AMA. Join me now: https://t.co/vbmpSKQMgM pic.twitter.com/Fd8G3yqDQQ  Bill Gates (@BillGates) March 8, 2016

Gates first gave his thoughts on the matter  in which Apple is refusing a court order to help the FBI unlock an iPhone used by one of the shooters in San Bernardino  in a Feb. 23 interview with the Financial Times. The Microsoft co-founder later said that he felt those quotes, which were widely characterized as putting him in the FBIs camp, did not accurately represent his full opinion on the case.

Gates answers on Tuesday, much like those he gave in another interview with Bloomberg TV, also didnt do much to clear up where the tech pioneer personally stands on the contentious case. Asked what he would do if he were in Apples position, Gates said the company could offer a Plan B.

Maybe they could propose an overall plan for striking the balance between government being able to know things in some cases and having safeguards to make sure those powers are confined to appropriate cases, Gates said. There is no avoiding this debate and they could contribute to how the balance should be struck.

Gates is no longer involved in the day-to-day operations of Microsoft, which along with nearly every other major tech company has filed a friend of the court brief supporting Apple in the California case.

msnbc.com,,Caitlyn Jenner's Clinton slam is latest example of conservative streak,[],"After emerging as an icon of the trans community last year, Caitlyn Jenner has become increasingly vocal about the 2016 presidential race, although her political allegiances may come as a surprise to some LGBT rights advocates.

On the premiere episode of the second season of her reality TV series, I Am Cait, Jenner unloaded on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton during a heated argument with one of her peers. If were unfortunate enough get Hillary as our next president, we need her on our side, the 66-year-old said, before adding that she wont be.

She couldnt care less about women, she only cares about herself, she added.

RELATED: Caitlyn Jenner to publish memoir in 2017

Ironically, Jenner has expressed an affinity for the candidacy of Sen. Ted Cruz who has shown very public, stubborn resistance to the notion of equal rights for trans citizens. Last fall he described making schools more accommodating to trans students lunacy and accused the Justice Department of trying to force [school districts] to let boys shower with little girls. And in January he harped on the restroom issue again, arguing that when it comes to a male transgender students they should use faculty facilities because inflicting him on the teachers is probably better than sticking him in the shower with the teenage girls.

You know, the funny thing is, my 5-year-old knows theres a difference between boys and girls, Cruz said on a conservative radio show last November. And yet modern leftists cant figure that out.

In 2014, the LGBT publication The Advocate named Cruz the Phobie of the Year for his vociferous opposition to same-sex marriage rights and for introducing a bill that February that would amount to essentially unmarrying any couple who set foot in a state without marriage equality.

Nevertheless, Jenner has said Cruz is a great constitutionalist, and a very articulate man, although she concedes that is probably one of the worst ones when it comes to trans issues. She went on to volunteer herself to be a trans ambassador for the Cruz campaign.

Jenners transition made her a bit of cause celebre in some left-wing circles, which appears to make the reality star, who identified herself as a longtime Republican during a high profile interview with Diane Sawyer last April, uncomfortable.

Were 18 and 1/2 trillion dollars in debt, our economys going to collapse, she said on her show. Sometimes these girls think that now that I have transitioned that everything has to change. You cant be conservative anymore, you have to be a liberal. No, I dont believe that. I think I can keep all of my views the same because I feel in my heart thats the way to go.

Jenner echoed similar sentiments when defending Cruz in a separate interview with The Advocate. Number one, if we dont have a country, we dont have trans issues, she said, adding later: Socialism did not build this country. Capitalism did. Free enterprise. The people built it. And they need to be given the opportunity to build it back up. She has acknowledged that Democrats have been the better party when it comes to addressing the rights of the LGBT community, but argues that Republicans are just worried about much bigger issues than the trans issues.

Some critics have argued that Jenner has long benefited from her considerable wealth and white privilege, and that dichotomy has continued since she transitioned, while trans women of color and those who live in impoverished circumstances are still subject to disproportionate discrimination and violence in their communities.

Im white. I make a good living. And I get all that. Ive heard that right from the beginning. Im not going to make excuses for myself. Im very happy that Ive worked very hard in my life and Im successful. Its kind of the American dream, Jenner told TIME last December. Were fortunate to live in a country where we can do that. Im very proud of what I was able to accomplish in my life. But Im also smart in the sense that I know how to use that to make everything better.

However, not everyone is impressed. Last month, Jenner got a mixed reception from an audience of University of Pennsylvania students when she reportedly claimed, I have gotten more flak for being a conservative Republican than I have for being trans.

The fact that she equated two completely different issues, invalidating one by doing so, is a problem in itself, College freshman Kenneth Lac reportedly told The Daily Pennsylvanian after the event.

Meanwhile, she has also expressed some ambivalence about same-sex marriage, telling talk show host Ellen DeGeneres last September: Im a traditionalist. Im older than most people in the audience. I kind of like tradition, and its always been a man and a woman. Im thinking, I dont quite get it.

Later, Jenner clarified her opinion in a blog post. Like many people, there was a time when I didnt realize how important it is for gay couples to have the right to get married. But after hearing from my gay friends and learning more about the hardships they faced because of discrimination, it became clear to me that everyone should be able to marry the person they love, she wrote. I can only hope that by sharing my story, theres someone out there whose mind has been changed about trans people.",[]

The dead were among the 200 or so fighters at a training camp some 120 miles north of Mogadishu who were preparing for an imminent large-scale attack against U.S. and regional governmental forces, officials told NBC News.

While the officials did not identify the al-Shabab targets, American special forces have been training Somali forces in the east African nation.

It appeared the group was in formation and conducting some kind of ceremony when American drones dropped bombs and launched Hellfire missiles at the al-Shabab militants, the officials said.

It was not clear whether any senior al-Shabab leaders were killed in the strikes.

msnbc.com,,Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder responds to Democratic debate,[],"Embattled Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder said he is committed to the people of Flint after Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton criticized him over his handling of the citys ongoing lead water crisis during a debate Sunday.

In the coming days, political candidates will be leaving Flint and Michigan, the Republican governor said in a statement on Sunday. They will not be staying to help solve the crisis, but I am committed to the people of Flint. I will fix this crisis and help move Flint forward. Long-term solutions are what the people of Flint need and what I am focused on delivering for them.

Snyder argued that he has proposed more than $230 million dollars in spending on resources for Flint residents, and supplied more than 439,000 cases of bottled water.

Both Sanders and Clinton used their opening statements to urge Snyder to resign.

Even though she has been critical of the governor, Sunday was the first time Clinton said Snyder should step resign or be recalled.

And we should support the efforts of citizens to achieve that, she added.

The debate came two days before Michigan voters head to the polls in the states primary. During the debate, Sanders and Clinton took questions from audience members who asked them about their plans to aid the city.

Snyders handling of the water crisis has also triggered protests and calls for him to be indicted. For more than a year, residents complained about the taste, smell and appearance of the water. But officials told them the water was safe. Tests later found that thousands of children have been exposed to high contamination levels of lead.

Snyder had apologized to residents for a contaminated water supply, but defended himself, saying that it was not brought to his attention until January. However, emails that were obtained by a local watchdog group revealed that one of Snyders advisers knew about a possible connection between Flints highly contaminated water supply and the surge in diagnosed cases of Legionnaires disease in the area since last March.",[]

Related: In Flint, both Clinton and Sanders call for Michigan Gov. Snyder to resign

The omission was striking, given that Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton is a former secretary of state, fully conversant on these topics. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has shown less comfort on these issues, but he has not been shy to criticize Clinton for being too hawkish in her views on foreign affairs.



Sanders has often pointed to Clintons vote in favor of authorizing the Iraq war while she served as a U.S. senator from New York and her role later in pushing President Obama to launch an air campaign over Libya in 2011. Clinton, Sanders said during a debate in October, is too into regime change.

But on Sunday there were next to no fireworks on this issue. During the debates opening minutes, Sanders briefly worked in a reference to the Iraq war, asking why the United States paid trillions of dollars for that war while it neglects problems at home.

msnbc.com,,"Christie camp held Sandy relief money hostage, mayor alleges",[],"Two senior members of Gov. Chris Christies administration warned a New Jersey mayor earlier this year that her town would be starved of hurricane relief money unless she approved a lucrative redevelopment plan favored by the governor, according to the mayor and emails and personal notes she shared with msnbc.

The mayor, Dawn Zimmer, hasnt approved the project, but she did request $127 million in hurricane relief for her city of Hoboken  80% of which was underwater after Sandy hit in October 2012. What she got was $142,000 to defray the cost of a single back-up generator plus an additional $200,000 in recovery grants.

Close video Mayor: Christie camp held Sandy money Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer says that top officials in Chris Christies administration have told her that her city will only receive critical Sandy relief funds if she expedites a redevelopment project in north Hoboken. Its not fair for the governor to... embed like save share group

In an exclusive interview, Zimmer broke her silence and named Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno and Richard Constable, Christies community affairs commissioner, as the two officials who delivered messages on behalf of a governor she had long supported.

The bottom line is, its not fair for the governor to hold Sandy funds hostage for the City of Hoboken because he wants me to give back to one private developer, she said Saturday on UP w/ Steve Kornacki. ... I know its very complicated for the public to really understand all of this, but I have a legal obligation to follow the law, to bring balanced development to Hoboken.

Constable and Christie  through spokespersons  deny Zimmers claims.

Mayor Zimmer has been effusive in her public praise of the Governors Office and the assistance weve provided in terms of economic development and Sandy aid, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak wrote in a statement. What or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyones guess.

Christies office later issued a second statement attacking MSNBC. MSNBC is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to Governor Christie and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him, even taking the unprecedented step of producing and airing a nearly three-minute attack ad against him this week, spokesman Colin Reed said.

Zimmers statements and documentation suggest that Christies administration  hailed for what seemed like a heroic response to Hurricane Sandy  in fact refused to help some of the neediest.

Id be more than willing to testify under oath and  and answer any questions and provide any documents, take a lie detector test, Zimmer said, referring to the Christie administrations denials. And, you know, my question back to them is, Would all of you? Would all of you be willing do that same thing, to testify under oath, to take a lie detector test?

Zimmers interview comes on the heels of a scandal in which other members of Christies inner circle conspired to create huge traffic swells, possibly in an act of political retribution, on another New Jersey town on the outskirts of Manhattan.

Christie, who sailed to re-election last year and has made no secret of his presidential ambitions, has denied any knowledge of the plot that shut down lanes at the foot of the George Washington Bridge, one of the most heavily trafficked in the country. His office and several former senior aides are currently the subject of a number of federal and state inquiries into what has become known as Bridge-gate.

RELATED: Whos who on the Bridge-gate subpoena list

In this account  supported by email, public records and Zimmers own diary entries  Christies inner circle was willing to cut off devastated constituents, muscle a friendly mayor and arrange public funds to finance a study for a project the governor supported.In a news conference last week, Christie rejected the notion that his administration engages in retribution or seeks political payback. Zimmers account paints a different portrait.

Zimmer claims they leaned on her twice to get their way. By the second encounter, Zimmer said  this time with Constable  the 45-year-old mayor and mother of two young children was despondent, according to her own notes.

I was emotional about governor Christie, she wrote in a diary entry she provided that is dated May 17, 2013. I thought he was honest. I thought he was moral. I thought he was something very different. This week I found out hes cut from the same corrupt cloth that I have been fighting for the last four years.

New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone told UP Saturday that Zimmers accusations suggest an abuse of power by the Christie administration. This is something that the U.S. attorney should be looking at, and has to be further investigated, he said.

Zimmer and Christie

Among the great ironies in the latest claims about the New Jersey governor is that without Christie, Zimmer would not likely have become the mayor of Hoboken.

What pole-vaulted her to the Mayors Office was a corruption scandal five years ago that enveloped a number of New Jersey politicians, including Zimmers predecessor. The investigation, which netted high profile convictions, was launched by the U.S. Attorneys office then led by Christie. By the time of the arrests in 2009, Christie had already resigned from office to run for governor. But it helped boost his image as tough on corruption and crime.

For Zimmer, it was a welcome sign for New Jerseys future and while she is a Democrat, she became a Christie supporter.

Swept into office from the city council, Zimmer inherited preliminary plans for a redevelopment project supported by the previous mayor.

The deal, as envisioned in 2008, would have awarded the Rockefeller Group  a New York developer  the right to redevelop a stretch of Hoboken. The project would have been eligible for tax incentives and it would have given the Rockefeller Group a much freer hand to build whatever they wanted while asking for millions in subsidies. If done right, it would have been an immensely lucrative deal in a town that has become a hip bedroom community of Manhattan.

Zimmer wasnt against the deal but she wanted a professional study done on the projected development. The problem was that Hobokens finances were in disarray and she wanted to wait until the community was on sounder footing before spending the money for a study.

Zimmer told the Rockefeller Group theyd have to follow the same process as everybody else. That process couldnt start until the city had enough money to pay professionals  planners and engineers  to study the issue.

The sides were at an impasse: the Rockefeller Group had big plans for hugely valuable land but Zimmer wasnt moving forward on it yet.

The dispute became public and thats when the Christie administration came in. Lori Grifa, who in 2010 served as Christies first community affairs commissioner, went to Hoboken that June and told Zimmer the administration might be able to help track down a source to pay for the study.

Soon enough, the Christie administration connected Zimmer to the Port Authority  the same jointly run New Jersey-New York agency that operates the George Washington Bridge, and is littered, on the New Jersey side, with Christies political appointees.

On Dec. 28, 2010, the Port Authority approved a $75,000 grant for the study but there was a catch. The Port Authority alone would choose the firm that conducted the study. In February 2011, it selected Clarke Caton Hintz  a reputable firm  to carry out the redevelopment study. It took a long time: the rest of 2011 and all through 2012, with Hurricane Sandy slowing things down.

Finally, in January 2013, the firm  which was tasked with evaluating a 19-block area  concluded that only the three blocks in which the Rockefeller Group had an ownership stake were fit for redevelopment.

Zimmers team was concerned. The landowners for the other 16 blocks were angry. They hired a lawyer who called the study curious, disturbing and suspect to the say the least.

The Rockefeller Group had its own representation  Wolff & Samson  the most powerful, politically connected law firm in all of New Jersey. Its heavily involved in development deals and its known for its close, intimate ties to the Christie administration. It is the firm of David Samson, the chairman of the Port Authority, the former attorney general of New Jersey, and a Christie appointee whos coming under increasing scrutiny in the Bridge-gate scandal.

The firm is also now the professional home of Lori Grifa, the former Christie aide who now lobbies on behalf of the Rockefeller Group.

Our client, The Rockefeller Group, has specifically asked us to speak with you regarding its property in Hoboken, Grifa emailed an attorney employed by Hoboken in early 2012.

Over many months, Grifa kept up the heat on Hoboken, with calls and email pressing for a decision on the project.

By April 5, 2013, Joe Marazati, the Hoboken lawyer, wrote to Zimmers director of community development. I am getting the full court press on this, Marazati wrote in an email. I have a voice mail from last night from Lori asking that I join a call this am with Lori and Dave Samson (chair of the PA) or suggest another time.

Email obtained by msnbc shows a raft of exchanges between the town of Hoboken and the law firm until May 8 when the Hoboken Planning Board voted 4-3 against the project, finding insufficient evidence to designate those three blocks for redevelopment.

Instead, the board declared the entire 19 block area in need of rehabilitation. The designation didnt make it impossible for the Rockefeller Group to get what it wanted but it was a strong signal that Zimmers team wasnt going to roll over for them.

In a statement to msnbc, a spokesman for the Rockefeller Group said: We have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation. If it turns out to be true it would be deplorable.

Sandy Aid

At the same time that the planning board voted against the study, Zimmer was applying for funding from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, a huge vault of money overseen by Christie to help communities hit hard by Sandy prepare themselves for the next storm.

After Sandy hit, in Hobokens darkest hour, Christie came to town and told residents they could count on him.

I spoke to the mayor this morning, and I told her Hoboken is in the front of my mind, and whenever theres any assistance thats needed here, Ill be here to help.

Christies people came back with less than 1% of what Hoboken had sought. With $250 million to disburse statewide, just $142,000 went to Hoboken  enough to help defray the cost of one backup generator to power a flood pump. Out of another pool of money for recovery grants  $1.8 billion in all  Hoboken received $200,000.Hoboken is perched above the mouth of the Hudson River, directly across from lower Manhattan. Following Christies visit, city officials submitted seven letters of intent for around $100 million in funds from programs the state was now running. Among the requests were money for storm surge coastal protection, money to buy properties to be used as open space and money for backup generators.

Please governor, Zimmer wrote in a letter following the decisions, we need your help. I have tried to assure Hoboken residents that we would be treated fairly because you have always treated Hoboken fairly in the past.

There was no response to that letter, dated May 8 of last year, the same day the Hoboken Planning Board did not adopt the redevelopment recommendation for the Rockefeller property.

Two days later, Zimmer got a call from the Lieutenant Governor, Kim Guadagno, who wanted to come to town to do an event at a ShopRite to spotlight businesses that had recovered from the storm.

On May 13, Guadagno and Zimmer met at the Hoboken ShopRite. That is where, Zimmer said, Guadagno delivered the first message about the relief aide.

Zimmer shared this diary entry which she said she wrote later that day. At the end of a big tour of ShopRite and meeting, she pulls me aside with no one else around and says that I need to move forward with the Rockefeller project. It is very important to the governor. The word is that you are against it and you need to move forward or we are not going to be able to help you. I know its not right  these things should not be connected  but they are, she says, and if you tell anyone, I will deny it.

The second warning, according to Zimmer, came four days later. She and Constable, who now led Christies department of community affairs, were seated together on stage for a for a NJTV public television special on Sandy Recovery.

Again, Zimmer provided this diary entry from May 17, which she said captured the incident.

We are miced up with other panelists all around us and probably the sound team is listening. And he says I hear you are against the Rockefeller project. I reply I am not against the Rockefeller project; in fact I want more commercial development in Hoboken. Oh really? Everyone in the State House believes you are against it  the buzz is that you are against it. If you move that forward, the money would start flowing to you he tells me.

Lisa M. Ryan, spokeswoman for Constable, said in a statement: Mayor Zimmers allegation that on May 16, 2013, Commissioner Constable conditioned Hobokens receipt of Sandy aid on her moving forward with a development project is categorically false.

Publicly, Zimmer has not spoken out against either Constable or Christie and the governors office was quick to point to two supportive tweets she wrote about the governor.

In the diary entry she shared, Zimmer concluded with these lines:

My beloved governor who wants to run for President. I cannot understand it. Why is he so concerned about Rockfeller? What has he promised them? What have they promised him? I cannot figure it out but I have no option but to stand up to him.

msnbc.com,,Sanders' surprise win and Clinton's defeat: What happened in Michigan?,[],"NBC News Kristen Welker, Kasie Hunt, Monica Alba, and Danny Freeman contributed reporting.

Theres no such thing as a sure bet in politics, but Michigan certainly seemed like one for Hillary Clinton. The Real Clear Politics average of recent polls had her up by more than 21 points on Election Day, and the data whizzes at FiveThirtyEight gave her a 99 percent chance of winning the race. (After Sanders won, they also called it one of the greatest upsets in modern political history.)

Even the Sanders campaign was bracing for defeat, and spent Tuesday pre-spinning a loss while the Clinton campaign gained little traction arguing the race was closer than expected.

RELATED: Michigan win rescues Bernie Sanders campaign

When exhausted Sanders staffers reached their hotel in Miami Tuesday night, they were stunned to find their candidate ahead in early returns and scrambled to assemble a podium so he could address the press. As Clinton gave a speech in Cleveland that did not mention Michigan, seemingly frustrated aides focused on Clintons large net delegate win in Mississippi, which held a primary on the same day.

So what happened? Both campaigns are still picking over the wreckage for clues, but heres what we know so far about how Sanders net an unexpected victory.

Sanders went all in, Clinton took her eye off the ball: Clinton seemed to take Michigan for granted after a string of big wins, leading her to begin turning to the general election. Team Sanders, meanwhile, saw Michigan as a must-win and invested accordingly. They outspent Clinton by about $500,000 on TV and spent almost three times as much on radio ads in the final week of the campaign as they had during any week in any state up to now.

Sanders brass deployed two veteran operatives  Robert Becker, who ran Sanders campaign in Iowa, and Julia Barnes, who ran his New Hampshire campaign  to help organize the state, and built a robust ground operation.

Clinton invested less heavily in her field program, which largely focused on African-Americans. Some supporters worried when they saw few Clinton yard signs, and some volunteers grumbled about disorganization and under-resourcing, but the realization of a major problem didnt come soon enough.

In closing days, the campaign scrambled to bring in reinforcements. They redirected Bill and Chelsea Clinton to spend more time in the state, and called on Michigan allies to rally troops. But it was too little, too late.

On a conference call with reporters Wednesday, Clintons campaign manager Robby Mook pushed back on that notion. Were proud of the ground game we ran, he said.

Geography: Clinton spent virtually all of her time in Detroit, along with a church visit in Flint last month and a small visit to a software company in Grand Rapids. Bill and Chelsea Clinton hit other parts of the state in the final push, but the candidate herself didnt hold any public rallies outside of Detroit during the entire campaign.

RELATED: Ghetto gaffe highlights Sanders campaigns struggle with race

While Clinton focused on population centers, Sanders allies said the candidate and his team did a better job of activating voters across the state. He won 73 of Michigans 83 counties (though Clinton won the most populous ones), and ran up large margins in counties that include Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor.

Despite making Flint the soul of her Michigan campaign, Clinton didnt hold a single open event in the city during her five days in the state leading up to Tuesday. She also did not attend the watch party her campaign organized after Sundays debate in Flint, as she has in other states, disappointing some attendees.

Inroads with African-American voters: African-Americans have been determinative of the Democratic primary so far, and may have been in Michigan, too. Clinton was once again banking on black voters, but Sanders performed better with that group in Michigan than he did in the South. He still lost black votes 68 to 38, but thats 20 points better than he did with that voting bloc in Mississippi. They also made up a slightly smaller proportion of the vote than expected.

Sanders core supporters turned out big: Young people, Sanders most important voting bloc, turned out in larger-than-expected numbers, with those younger than 30 making up the same portion of the electorate as those older than 65. Sanders visited every college town in the state, turning out huge crowds when he did, which the campaign says proves their point that they can move the needle anywhere they move their candidate.

And Sanders did better than usual among those slightly older, winning 53 percent of those between the ages of 30 and 44.

Michigans open primary allows independents to vote in either party, and Sanders always does well among among independents. He performed even better than expected with that group on Tuesday, winning 71 percent of independents casting ballots in the Democratic primary.

Some speculate that Clinton supporters were complacent and stayed home, or possibly even voted in the Republican primary in an attempt to stop Trump.

The weather: It was an unseasonably warm 70 degrees in much of the state on Election Day, helping to push up turnout in both partys primaries to record levels. More than 2.5 million voters participated in the Republican and Democratic primaries, shattering the record of 1.93 million set in the 1972 primary and the expected 2 million turnout.

Fertile ground for Sanders message: Late-deciders broke for Sanders and most pollsters had stopped contacting voters on Sunday. Michigan was a perfect place for Sanders message because of its Rust Belt history and relatively friendly demographics. His emphasis on unpopular free trade deals and his performance in Sunday nights debate, while panned by some analysts, could have changed minds.

The Sanders campaign also believes Clintons charge (which they called misleading and unfair) that he voted against the auto bailout backfired. The auto rescue was included in the Wall Street bailout bill, which Sanders voted against, and they believe hitting on him on the issue played into the idea that she is dishonest and reminded voters of Wall Street. Mook rejected that claim outright. Well continue to talk about it, he said.",[]

msnbc.com,,Trump: 'Not proud' of children mimicking my deportation rhetoric,[],"Donald Trump said Wednesday he is not proud that children are mimicking his rhetoric.

There have been incidents of children, of white children, pointing to their darker-skinned classmates and saying, Youll be deported when Donald Trump is president. There have been incidents of white kids at basketball games holding up signs to teams which have Hispanic kids on them, saying, Were going to build a wall to keep you out. Are you proud of that? Is that something youve done in American political and social discourse that youre proud of? NPR news analyst Cokie Roberts asked Trump on Morning Joe.

Roberts question was prompted by reports from around the country that the language Trump has used on the campaign trail is being repeated by youth.

A Virginia school district confirmed a story about a third grader being told by his classmates that he would be deported if Trump became president. The childs mother took to Facebook to voice her disgust, writing, I just got a call from my sons teacher... that two of his classmates... point(ed) out the immigrants in the class who would be sent home when Trump becomes President... They singled him out... because of the color of his skin... In third grade.... in Fairfax County... in 2016.

A high school basketball game in Indiana took a controversial turn after spectators allegedly chanted statements that were taken as racist toward Latinos. A report said that fans of one team had big placards with Donald Trumps face and were yelling, Build a wall, build a wall.

The business moguls name was also invoked during an Iowa basketball game to allegedly taunt a team that included boys from racial minorities. According to a report, fans of the opposing team chanted Trump! Trump! Trump! to rile the players.

Trump took issue with Roberts inquiry and insisted he did not have knowledge of these incidents. He also maintained that his rhetoric on deportation was directed toward illegal immigration.

I think your questions a very nasty question, Trump said. And Im not proud of it because I didnt even hear of it, OK? And I certainly do not like it at all when I hear about it. Youre the first one whose told me about that.

I talk about deporting people that are here illegally, Trump said of his immigration platform. We have a country or we dont.

But what about the children, Mr. Trump? Roberts asked. Trump defended his message, calling it very positive. The Republican front-runner went on to say that he thought the United States needed to be made great again.

I think America is right now very, very troubled. I think were being laughed at all over the world.

Referencing the military, Trump said that we cant beat ISIS and that veterans are being treated poorly. Trump also pointed to health care and debt after saying that the U.S. education system is at the bottom of the heap worldwide.

msnbc.com,,MO state senators end filibuster over 'religious freedom' bill,"['Associated Press', 'Erik Ortiz']","A 39-hour filibuster led by Democratic legislators in Missouri ended Wednesday morning when Republicans forced a vote on a controversial measure to add more religious protections to people opposed to same-sex marriage.

The bill, known as Senate Joint Resolution 39, passed 21-11 after the GOP senators broke the filibuster using a procedural move.

The talk-a-thon on the Missouri State Capitol floor in Jefferson City  perhaps the longest continuous filibuster in the states history  began 4 p.m. Monday. The Democrats took turns criticizing the hot-button bill.

It proposes to amend the Missouri Constitution and prohibit the state from penalizing clergy, religious organizations, and certain individuals for their religious beliefs concerning marriage between two people of the same sex.

The Republican-controlled state Senate must vote an additional time on the measure before the MIssouri House can take it up.

The senators efforts had been praised by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, who said they are standing on the right side of history.

Inspired by senators heroic stand against discrimination in #MO. The nation is watching & cheering you on! #SJR39 #NotInMyState  Governor Jay Nixon (@GovJayNixon) March 9, 2016

Though it doesnt list specific protected businesses, the measure comes after bakers and florists have faced legal challenges in other states for declining to provide services for same-sex weddings.

In less serious moments of the filibuster, the senators riffed on Tyler Perry movies, shoes, and Jews who eat pork, according to The New York Times. Star Wars trivia came up, too.

Business in the chamber was effectively halted, and highlighted the national debate over balancing civil rights and religious liberties following last years Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.

Missouris session runs through mid-May. That leaves plenty of time for Resolution 39 to also move through the Republican-led House. It would then be submitted to statewide voters in either the August primary or November general election.

During the filibuster, Democrats proved to be relentless.

State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, of St. Louis, said she was taking dietary supplements for energy. State Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, a Republican, said Tuesday he has had not slept since the filibuster started  aside from a roughly 15-minute nap in the Senate chamber.

Democratic state Sen. Jason Holsman, of Kansas City, said he had not left the Capitol since Monday afternoon.

That means Im probably pretty rank at this point, Holsman said on the Senate floor.

The filibuster marked the longest continuous debate in recent Missouri history. Four state Senate Democrats  including current U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr.  led a 38-hour filibuster spread over five legislative days against an abortion bill in 1999. That bill ultimately passed the state Senate.

Missouris session also surpasses the longest filibuster in the U.S. Senate, when Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes to stall the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. He reportedly read from historical documents to pass the time.

More recently, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz in 2013 spent 21 hours and 18 minutes filibustering from the U.S. Senate floor to oppose Obamacare. He read bedtime stories for part of it.

msnbc.com,,Rubio says he's 'not entirely proud' of personal attacks against Trump,['Alexandra Jaffe'],"Marco Rubio said Wednesday hes not entirely proud of his personal attacks on Donald Trump and wouldnt have launched them if he could do things over again.

In terms of things that have to do with personal stuff, yeah, at the end of the day its not something Im entirely proud of. My kids were embarrassed by it, and if I had to do it again I wouldnt, he said during an MSNBC town hall.

view photo essay The presidential campaign: Marco Rubio Because of his youth and relatively moderate campaign rhetoric, Rubio is often touted as the Republican Partys best hope of appealing to younger voters.

Rubios sudden shift to aggressively attacking Trump one week before the Super Tuesday primary contests saw the candidate mock Trump on the debate stage and during nearly every one of his stump speeches following. The attacks took a personal turn, with Rubio making fun of Trumps tan, his hair and ultimately the size of his hands  a veiled jab at Trumps manhood  at a rally shortly before voters went to the polls that week.

The strategy won him wall-to-wall media coverage but did little to cement Rubio as the anointed alternative to Trump. Indeed, it appears to have hurt him, as he struggled to overcome Ted Cruz during the Super Tuesday contests and his support has since cratered, resulting in disappointing finishes in primaries across the nation over the past week. Some Republicans have criticized Rubio for damaging the image of the Republican Party, as major Republican donor Fred Malek put it on MSNBC this week.

Rubios comments Wednesday were an implicit acknowledgment that the strategy didnt work, and he has since shifted away from personal attacks on Trump in favor of more policy-focused fare. But he insisted that it was appropriate to point out that Trump is portraying himself as something hes not, a central focus of his argument against the GOP frontrunner.

RELATED: Marco Rubios campaign is on life support

Trump has been dismissive of Rubios attacks, telling reporters at a press conference Tuesday that hostility works for some people  it doesnt work for him. But on MSNBC Wednesday morning, he was asked about the possibility of a Rubio pick.

Sure, sure and hes got talent. I just dont want to say that yet, Trump said.

Rubio, however, insisted at the MSNBC town hall Rubio said he had no interest in playing second fiddle for Trump or any other GOP candidates.

Im not looking to be anyones vice president, Rubio said.

Pressed directly is he would tell Trump no if asked to being his running mate, Rubio responded, absolutely.

msnbc.com,,Democratic wins in Kentucky deny GOP total control,[],"Republican dominance over the South is quite extraordinary, but theres one entity in the region that Democrats have managed to hold onto: the Kentucky State House, which Dems have controlled since 1921. This week, Republicans hoped to change that.

When Kentuckys General Assembly convened in January, Democrats still controlled the chamber, 50 to 46, but there were four vacancies that needed to be filled. The states new, right-wing governor, Republican Matt Bevin, announced there would be special elections on March 8 to fill those four seats, and quite possibly erase the Democratic advantage.

I want conservative people, Bevin declared at the time, adding, I will do everything in my power to make sure that the people who I think embody the values that I was elected to represent are elected. I do think theyll be Republicans.

The governor thought wrong. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported overnight:

Democrats won three of four House seats up for grabs in Tuesdays special election, increasing their majority status in the House chamber by one for the rest of the 2016 General Assembly, including the all-important process of writing the next state budget. T he House will have 53 Democrats and 47 Republicans through the fall elections. It is the final state legislative chamber in the South to remain in Democratic control, and it is the last bastion of Democratic Party power in Kentucky, which otherwise has been trending Republican in state and federal elections.

Democratic candidates not only won the two seats that had been held by other Dem lawmakers, the party also flipped a seat that had been held by a Republican.

For Bevin, who campaigned aggressively in these special elections and helped the GOP candidates raise money, its a real setback. In fact, its arguably a rebuke  if the governor and his agenda enjoyed broad support, his party likely would have fared better yesterday.

But just as important is the fact that Bevin was counting on total Republican control of the state government to do what far-right governors have been able to do in states like Michigan, Kansas, and North Carolina: implement a radical agenda without regard for Democratic objections.

msnbc.com,,All-female 'Ghostbusters' already fending off controversy,[],"The highly anticipated all-female reboot of Ghostbusters has already become a source of controversy after just one trailer for the film has seen the light of day.

Leslie Jones is an actress, thats clear, right? You know she could act like a scientist like the white people, yes? #ghostbusters #ugh  Sofiya Alexandra (@TheSofiya) March 3, 2016

When the first teaser for the film debuted earlier this month there was widespread criticism of the fact that the lone African-American ghostbuster  played by Saturday Night Live star Leslie Jones  is a blue-collar worker for the New York City transit agency, while the other three, played by Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon, were all scientists.

Jones struck back at critics of the choice on social media. Why cant a regular person be a ghostbuster. Im confused. And why cant i be the one who plays them i am a performer. Just go see the movie! she tweeted. Regular People save the world everyday so if Im the sterotype!! Then so be it!! We walk among Heroes and take them for granted.

RELATED: Dan Aykroyd delighted by all-female Ghostbusters

Later, she added: ITS NOT A MAN, WOMAN, RACE, CLASS THANG!! ITS A GHOSTBUSTER THANG!! AND AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED WE ALL GHOSTBUSTERS!! STAND TALL!! She also shared a supportive message from a real life NYC transit worker who applauded her representation in the upcoming film.

But when the backlash refused to died down, Jones  who has polarized audiences with some of her politically incorrect routines on SNL in the past  floated the idea of quitting Twitter entirely, which prompted a defense from the new Ghostbusters films director Paul Feig.

Dont leave us, @Lesdoggg. You are a goddess & one of the warmest funniest forces of nature I know. F**k the haters, he tweeted. And haters, attack me all you want but when you attack and insult my cast, youve crossed the line. Grow up and leave my cast alone.

While African-American comedian Cyrus McQueen considers Jones an amazing talent and was thrilled to see her become a part of such an iconic franchise, he told MSNBC on Wednesday that the trailer left him with a sinking feeling down in the pit of my stomach.

Although this is an ensemble, it seemed to me that a black actress was again boxed into the role of sassy sidekick, best friend, the tough talking blue collar worker, there only to provide some comedic sass, some edge, yet in no way challenge the flawed and pre-existing views of African-American women, he said.

And while McQueen concedes that the film is a comedy and an absurd one to boot, its still problematic how often black actors are relegated to certain types of roles in the genre.

Ill never forget, in my very first scene in my very first improv [comedy] class, my scene partner pimped me into being a man that was mugging him. And so, I feel when it comes to this new Ghostbusters, Leslie Jones was pimped into being the predictable yet palatable urban black sidekick. Again, I love her and I love that they gave her this opportunity. Im not hating the player, to again reference the world of improv, Im hating the game.

#NeverForget: In the #Ghostbusters book, Winston is a Marine and the original script had him holding mad PhDs pic.twitter.com/68T0liFcn5  Black Nerd Problems (@blknrdproblems) March 4, 2016

Veteran actor Ernie Hudson, who played Zeddemore in the 1984 original and its 1989 sequel, has been largely sanguine about his part in the series, which was originally a much larger one written for comedian Eddie Murphy. But when the film marked its 30th anniversary in 2014, he expressed more ambiguity about how his role was handled.

Instead of coming in at the very beginning of the movie, like page eight, the character came in on page 68 after the Ghostbusters were established. His elaborate background was all gone, replaced by me walking in and saying, If theres a steady paycheck in it, Ill believe anything you say, he told Entertainment Weekly at the time. The next morning, I rush to the set and plead my case. And [the director] basically says, The studio felt that they had Bill Murray, so they wanted to give him more stuff to do. I go, Okay, I understand that, but can I even be there when theyre established? And of course, he said no, theres nothing to do about it. It was kind of awkward, and it became sort of the elephant in the room.

All these years later, the new Ghostbusters is arriving in a cultural climate that is far more aware and sensitive to the marginalization of characters of color. Ever since this reboot was announced there has been grumbling within the fan base about the decision to recast the series with women, even though all of the original stars have given the new film their blessing. Audiences wont get a chance to judge the film for themselves until this summer, and some of Jones fans have embraced a wait-and-see approach for now.

Im not saying that she should constantly defend herself, but she can use the platform to promote her art, and have honest and open dialogue with people that follow her and some folks that have issues with her role, BET associate editor Taj Rani told MSNBC on Wednesday. As an industry veteran she knows that folks wont like or love everything that she does, but she is important to the representation of black women in comedy and thats something that shouldnt go over anyones head. And because of that we want her voice and talent onscreen, behind the scenes and on social media.

Meanwhile, the international version of the trailer for the film includes a direct reference to the race issue. When Jones character attempts to crowd surf in one scene and the audience allows her to crash land on the floor, she quips: I dont know if it was a race thing or a lady thing, but Im mad as hell.",[]

msnbc.com,,Kasich goes after Clinton on Libya war,[],"A discussion during Thursdays Republican presidential debate about the growth of ISIS inside the country of Libya prompted a sharp remark from Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who told a Michigan debate hall that Hillary Clinton was to blame.

Hillary Clinton worked aggressively to depose Muammar Gaddafi, Kasich said during the Fox News Republican debate in Detroit, referring to Clintons time as secretary of state under President Obama.

They pushed him out, Kasich said of the Libyan leader. Now we have a fertile ground for ISIS.

Although Kasich is trailing in polls, his attack could have lasting power beyond his own candidacy. Should Clinton become the Democratic nominee, she will likely face questions about how to address the ISIS presence inside a country she helped to shake up. Libya is Clintons personal problem in a way that Iraq and Syria  where the American air campaign is currently focused  are not.

RELATED: Only the voters can judge Donald Trumps horror show of a debate

Asked by moderators how he would address the problem, Kasich said that American troops may have to intervene inside Libya to take on ISIS there, a position that put him in agreement with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Whatever one thinks of American troops in Libya as a matter of policy, Kasichs history lesson is not without merit.

A civil war in Libya flared at the outset of the so-called Arab Spring, leaving the White House to ponder intervening in order to protect the Libyan people. Clinton, along with then-U.N. ambassador Susan Rice and White House adviser Samantha Power, pushed for military action. A NATO-led air campaign began in the spring of 2011. In October of that year, Gaddafi was hunted down and killed by a rebel mob.

Since Gaddafis death, Libya has spiraled into further disarray. The country is now run by two rival governments and vast stretches of desert south of the coastline are home to terrorist organizations, including affiliates of ISIS.

Democrats appeared to have also realized this could be a problem for Clinton.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has brought up the war in Libya during debates, as well, accusing Clinton of being too into regime change.

Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley was even tougher on Clinton before he dropped out of the race last month. I know Sec. Clinton was gleeful when Gaddafi was torn apart, the former Democratic presidential candidate said during a debate in December.

Clinton has called the Libya war an exercise in smart power, noting that European allies had pleaded with the U.S. to intervene on behalf of the Libyan people. We did not put one single American soldier on the ground in Libya, Clinton said during a debate in October.

But now there are new questions about whether American soldiers are needed there  and not to free a population this time, but to battle a terrorist army.",[]

Brandi Chastain, who became Americas soccer-playing hero when she when she scored the game-winning goal for the U.S. against China in the 1999 World Cup final, is donating her brain to science, officials at Boston University confirmed Thursday.

Chastains gray matter is going to BU researchers studying chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE, a degenerative brain disease that has been found in athletes who suffered concussions during their careers.

Im not going to be needing it at the end of my life, Chastain told USA TODAY Sports.

Chastain, who is 47 and retired from the sport that made her famous, said she hopes scientists can learn something from studying the brain of a woman athlete like her.

Could we then use that information to help say that before the age of 14, its not a good idea to head the ball? she told the paper.

Chastain said she suffered two concussions while playing college soccer and sometimes saw stars but has not exhibited any CTE symptoms.

I never had an official diagnosis of a concussion in my career, she said. But as you grow older, you sometimes say, gosh, am I losing my memory or did I used to forget when I went into a room what I went in there for? Could this be the start of something?

Dr. Ann McKee, who heads the CTE Center at BU, applauded Chastain.

Brandi Chastains decision to donate her brain to further research is a powerful and courageous act that will ultimately improve the future health of female athletes, military veterans and other women who experience repetitive brain trauma, McKee said in a statement. We currently know so little about how gender influences outcome after trauma; her pledge marks an important step to expand our knowledge in this critical area.

Just seven of the 307 brains that BU researchers have examined were from women and none were diagnosed with CTE, BU medical school spokeswomanGina DiGravio-Wilczewski said.

Chastain landed on the covers of Sports Illustrated, TIME and Newsweek after scoring her game-winning goal when she tore off her jersey in celebration.

Paul McCartney described Martin as like a second father to me.

In a statement, he added: If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle it was George. From the day that he gave The Beatles our first recording contract, to the last time I saw him, he was the most generous, intelligent and musical person Ive ever had the pleasure to know ... The world has lost a truly great man who left an indelible mark on my soul and the history of British music.

Thank you for all your love and kindness George peace and love xx pic.twitter.com/um2hRFB7qF  #RingoStarr (@ringostarrmusic) March 9, 2016

Martin was an EMI staff producer who had the foresight and the ear to sign a band that had been turned down by virtually every other major label in London in 1962, before Starr was a full-fledged member. Martin signed the group from Liverpool to the Parlophone imprint he oversaw before meeting the members on the strength of demo tapes shopped by manager Brian Epstein. He often said in interviews that he was initially impressed as much by their wit and natural charm as he was by their musical abilities.

In a story that has become Beatles legend, as Martin showed the group around the EMI recording studio at their first extended recording session, he asked if there was anything they didnt like about the configuration of the studio. Guitarist George Harrison quickly responded: For starters, I dont like your tie.

Martin proved to be a huge influence on the groups sound  he famously suggested they speed up the tempo of Please, Please Me, turning a Roy Orbison-esque ballad into a rocker that marked the Beatles first No. 1 record in Britain. Perhaps most significantly, he expressed his faith in McCartney and John Lennon as songwriters by conceding to their demand to record their own material and rebuffing his suggestion that the pop tune How Do You Do It be their first single.

Through the bands ups and downs in the late 1960s, Martin remained a constant for the Beatles, a figure who commanded respect from Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Harrison no matter how fierce the in-fighting was among the foursome.

Martins skill as a producer and arranger allowed the band to flourish as they evolved from recording the material theyd worked out on stage for years in clubs to the more intricate recordings found on the 1965 album Rubber Soul and 1966s Revolver. He helped them arrange strings for Yesterday and work with more exotic instruments such as the Indian sitar that Harrison began experimenting with on such songs as Norwegian Wood.

The bands major collaboration with a producer other than Martin came on tracks that comprised the 1970 album Let It Be, which by many accounts was a frustrating experience as producer Phil Spector applied his Wall of Sound formula to songs such as the title song and The Long and Winding Road. After Let It Be, the group enlisted Martin for producing duties on Abbey Road, which was released prior to Let It Be but was recorded afterward.

Martin worked with a range of other artists during and after the Beatles era, from Cilla Black to Tom Jones to America to solo works by Paul McCartney and by Wings. But it was his success with the Beatles that made Martin one of the most famous record producers of all time. He earned Britains prestigious CBE honor in 1988.

Born in 1926, Martin became interested in music at a young age. During World War II, he worked as a surveyor and clerk for the War Office and joined the Royal Navy working as a pilot in its Fleet Air unit. He left the service in 1947 and enrolled in Guildhall School of Music, where he studied piano.

He began working for the BBCs classical music department after graduation but by 1950 had joined EMI. He worked as an assistant to the head of the low-profile Parlophone imprint, which was known for novelty and comedy records including a recording of the famed Beyond the Fringe comedy outfit featuring Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett.

By 1955, Martin had taken over as head of Parlophone. His experience with cutting-edge British comedy talent resonated would later help him bond with the Beatles. Martin by his own account was intrigued by the surge of pop and R&B acts in Britain in the early 1960s. He was in the market for a group to work with when Epstein called on him with tapes that had been recorded  and rejected  by Decca Records. Martin set a handshake deal with Epstein in May 1962 but didnt finalize the contract until he met the band the following month.

At the same time, Sen. Marco Rubio, the candidate many in the establishment pegged as their champion, appears to be on life support. His rapid decline leaves Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a hardline conservative loathed by many party insiders, as the GOPS last best alternative to Trump.

RELATED: Theres just one week left to stop Donald Trump

Trump easily won Michigan and Mississippi, the two biggest delegate prizes of the night. In doing so he once again dashed rivals hopes that their frantic efforts to drag down his campaign might finally be yielding fruit. Cruz won in Idaho while Hawaii, the last state to come in, was still voting as of midnight. ET.

I dont think Ive ever had so many horrible things said about me, Trump stated in a press conference on Tuesday night.

The two races were a heat check ahead of crucial winner-take-all races in Ohio and Florida. The results suggest that Trump is well positioned to compete in both states. If they go his way, his rivals will have few paths to defeating him short of a long shot effort to narrowly deny him a delegate majority and then somehow oust him in a contested convention in July.

view photo essay Standing up against Donald Trump At Trump rallies, people of all ages and creeds, even some outside the continent, have continued to make their voices heard.

Making Trumps path to Florida easier: The ongoing collapse of Rubio, who suffered through a brutal night on Tuesday ahead of his home state primary.

In Michigan, a state Rubios campaign would likely have considered prime territory just weeks ago, he failed to crack double digits. The results were even worse in Mississippi, where he finished in fourth with just 5 percent with 92 percent of precincts reporting.

It was a major shift from Super Tuesday just one week earlier, when Rubio closely battled Senator Ted Cruz for second place in similar southern states. This time Rubio finished well behind third-place Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has shown little appeal in the region.

Rubios implosion could not come at a worse time, both for his own campaign and for the broader anti-Trump effort led by former Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

Romney, who recorded robo-calls for Rubio and Kasich in Michigan, urged Republicans in a speech last week to vote for the senator in Florida and Kasich in Ohio in order to deny Trump a delegate majority. Now Rubio looks like a zombie candidate as the race turns to his own state, where many voters have already cast early ballots.

RELATED: Anti-Trump forces have very few options for third party alternative

After largely avoiding clashes with Trump for months, Rubio turned his campaign into a vehicle for an all-out war on the front-runner over the last several weeks. In speeches and debates, he derided Trump as a con artist and unelectable, accused him of ripping off students with his Trump University program, and mocked his hair, his tan, and the size of his anatomy.

The results, combined with weak performances in four states on Saturday, suggested that his kitchen sink strategy against Trump backfired big time. Heading into Tuesday night, Rubio had won just two contests: Minnesota and Puerto Rico.

Even before the latest races, Rubio had already started to acknowledge that he was unlikely to win the nomination without forcing a contested convention.

Assuming he stays in the race through Florida, Rubio will have significant help from outside the campaign for his last stand. Republican donors have poured over $8.3 million into a variety of super PACs that are carpet bombing Trump with attack ads in Florida, per NBC News  far more than Trumps $1.7 million in ad spending.

For Cruz, Rubios staggered position presents an opportunity to knock his rival out of the race quickly, and then hope he can sideline Kasich to force a one-on-one contest against Trump. Cruz is campaigning in Miami on Wednesday and a super PAC supporting him has announced it will run several different attack ads against Rubio this week.

There is some polling evidence, including a new NBC/WSJ survey of GOP voters released on Tuesday, that Trump is vulnerable if the race shrinks to two people. Anti-Trump Republicans dont have time to slowly wear him down, though. They need him to fall apart  and fast  to have any hopes of stopping him.

As it stands, even their most optimistic scenarios at this point assume a brutal July convention that would likely shatter party unity just as the general election begins. Whether or not they manage to defeat Trump at this point, the damage Trumps campaign has already done to the GOPs present incarnation is catastrophic. Whatever party crawls out of the smoking wreckage of the primary will not be the same one that entered it.",[]

msnbc.com,,What if Mario Cuomo had run for president?,[],"Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who died on New Years Day at age 82, leaves behind a formidable political legacy  and a mystery for the ages: What if hed gotten on that plane?

It was Dec. 20, 1991, a Friday, and the filing deadline for New Hampshires first-in-the-nation presidential primary was at 5 p.m. All eyes, though, were on Albany, New York where 10 weeks of torturous and highly public vacillation were for Gov. Cuomo finally coming to a head. In the statehouse, he and his team sought a last-minute resolution to a budget impasse that  the governor had suggested more than once  represented the only significant obstacle between him and a presidential candidacy. A few miles away, a private plane sat idling at Albanys airport, ready to whisk Cuomo to the Granite State on a moments notice.

RELATED: Liberal lion Mario Cuomo dies at age 82

It was a drama that had kicked off in early October, when seemingly out of nowhere Cuomo had told a closed-door meeting of his donors at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan that he would think about running for president in 1992. With that one gesture, he effectively froze in place the Democratic field  and all of American politics  for the rest of the fall.

Sure, there were already six Democrats seeking the partys nomination to oppose George H.W. Bush, including Bill Clinton, who we know today as one of American historys most talented political salesmen. But Clinton was a dwarf in 1991, a little-known governor from a backwater state who most people figured was running for president for the exposure. To that point, the story of the presidential race hadnt been who was running; it was who had taken a pass: Bill Bradley, Al Gore, Richard Gephardt, Lloyd Bentsen, Jay Rockefeller  basically, every A-lister on the Democratic side.

Bush was supposed to be invulnerable. In early 91, hed orchestrated the Gulf War, evicting Saddam Hussein from Kuwait and, it was said, helping the country kick its Vietnam syndrome once and for all. Massive parades and homecoming celebrations ensued, pushing Bushs approval rating over 90% and leaving Democrats to pick from scraps. At that point, it was an open question whether the Democratic Party could ever win a national election again. Republicans had won at least 40 states in the past three White House races, and except for Jimmy Carters squeaker in 1976 (which had come to look more and more like a fluke), the GOP was undefeated since 1968. The Democrats, many concluded, were now simply a congressional party.

RELATED: Politicians react to Mario Cuomos death

But the economy was in trouble and Bushs numbers were starting to erode. 92 might not necessarily be a lost cause, Democrats began to say  if only we had a real candidate. Thats what made Cuomos October admission such a major event. The Mario Cuomo of 1991 wasnt just a big-name Democrat  he was the big-name Democrat, a folk hero to the partys beleaguered liberal base ever since his mesmerizing 1984 convention speech, a living, breathing reminder of the politically potent connection with ethnic Catholics that had powered the party in the days of FDR and LBJ  and that had frayed badly in the age of Reagan. To Democrats, the promise of Mario Cuomo was the promise of restoration. It was also the promise of victory. If they were going to break the GOPs Electoral College lock in 92, a Clinton or a Paul Tsongas or a Jerry Brown or a Bob Kerrey wouldnt do it. They needed the stature of a Mario Cuomo.

He didnt make it easy on them. For the rest of October, through all of November, and right up until that fateful Friday before Christmas, Cuomo issued a steady stream of utterly contradictory hints and head fakes. One day, it would sound like he was in. What does my heart tell me? he asked in late October. Go out and tell them, Mario  take your best shot, whether you win, lose or draw. But then nothing would happen. He talked of reaching a decision by the November election, and then by Thanksgiving, but those dates came and went. One of the partys top strategic minds, James Carville, pronounced himself ready to help run a Cuomo campaign  then, after hearing not a peep from Albany, signed on with Clinton. Party leaders grew restless, and his would-be rivals, starved of media oxygen, became contemptuous.

As the New Hampshire deadline neared, Clinton said: I always thought hed run, and I always thought hed wait until the last minute. He waited long enough to see which way the wind was blowing.

Thats when it started to look like Cuomo was actually going to do it. The Monday of that deadline week, his team dispatched an emissary to the New Hampshire Statehouse to retrieve the necessary paperwork. The next day, New Yorks top Republican, Sen. Alfonse DAmato, paid a trip to Albany to ridicule Cuomos inability to reach a budget deal  and to preview what Republicans would say if he went ahead and ran.

The more I hear their attack, Cuomo said, the more enticing it becomes.

By Thursday, there were stories about fundraising calls, out-of-state endorsements and rented office space in New Hampshire. On the day of the deadline, the New York Post quoted a top Cuomo aide saying, It looks and smells like a go. The Washington Post reported that signs pointed to the governor becoming a candidate. There was only one cable news channel back then, and throughout the day that Friday, CNN kept returning to a live shot of the idling plane. Any minute, Cuomo might board it, jet off to New Hampshire, and write his own chapter of history.

But it never moved, and by mid-afternoon it was clear that it wasnt going to. When he faced the press, Cuomo stuck to his script about the budget. If thered been a deal, he said, I would travel to New Hampshire today and file my name as a candidate. But that was  and still is  a hard one to swallow. With all of his pride and conviction, Cuomo never seemed like the kind of guy whod farm out a decision like that to a bunch of opposition party state legislators.

Not that a truly satisfactory explanation has emerged these past 23 years. It remains one of those great conversation-starting what ifs? What if Cuomo had run? Would he have dominated the Democratic field and dethroned a weakened Bush? Or maybe that chronic indecision would have translated into a dysfunctional candidacy that would have wilted under a level of scrutiny Cuomo had never before faced? (My own guess is that Cuomo would have won the nomination, if only because his presence would have dramatically altered how Democrats would have interpreted the subsequent Gennifer Flowers/Bill Clinton scandal  a scandal in which Cuomos name played a role. But thats another column for another day.)

The theory I ultimately gravitate toward is that Mario Cuomo was attracted to the nobility of a lost cause. In 1977, he ran for mayor stoically voicing opposition to capital punishment even as the Son of Sam terrorized New York City. In 1984 at the Democratic convention, his keynote address served as a valentine to the New Deal in liberalisms darkest hour. This is a man who could have looked at all those Democrats running away from George H.W. Bush and his 90% approval rating and decided that maybe this was a race that needed him. And this is a man who, upon realizing that he might actually win, could just as easily have decided he didnt want the trouble.",[]

view photo essay Standing up against Donald Trump At Trump rallies, people of all ages and creeds, even some outside the continent, have continued to make their voices heard.

Khalaf Al Habtoor, who has featured on the Forbes rich list, said Wednesday he was afraid a segment of the American public was falling under the sway of inappropriate candidates with extreme positions and vulgar turns of phrase.

I have always naively believed that presidential candidates were thoroughly screened in terms of background, family ties, colleagues and friends. It appears they are not, the billionaire wrote in An Open Letter to Our American Friends that is due to appear in Middle Eastern newspapers later this week.

Al Habtoor added that he was a great admirer of the U.S.

He wrote: All I can do is appeal to you, the voters, to sit quietly, take a deep breath and ponder on all the pros and cons of each candidate. Do not get caught up in hysteria or in the cult of personality. Your country is worth more. Forget such labels as Democrat and Republican.

Al Habtoor is the chairman of United Arab Emirates-based conglomerate Al Habtoor Group, which built Dubais airport and owns Aston Martin and Bentley dealerships and luxury hotels throughout the region.

He did not refer to Trump by name in the letter obtained by NBC News on Wednesday. But on Dec. 8, Al Habtoor told NBC News that he regretted supporting Trump, whom he had previously endorsed, after the real-estate mogul called for a total and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the U.S.

GOP debates are devolved into entertaining slanging matches with rivals launching personal attacks on one another to grab the media spotlight, he said, claiming that none of the Republican candidates had the dignity or gravitas to be commander-in-chief.

This is not a game or a television series. You, the good people of America, hold not only your future but the future of the world in your hands, Al Habtoor said.

He went on to support Hillary Clinton for president, saying the onetime first lady had a tried and true record despite missteps involving a private network server she used while secretary of state.

msnbc.com,,Donald Trump reveals details of his health care plan,[],"Donald Trump released his health care plan Wednesday evening, finally detailing the way in which he would fulfill his campaign trail promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.

In as seven-point plan posted to his website and publicized by a tweet, Trump says he will do away with the individual health insurance mandate, as well as allow competition over states lines for health care plans, and block grant Medicaid to the states, allowing them to follow through on his prescription to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse to preserve our precious resources.

I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare! Read more about my positions on healthcare reform here: https://t.co/WwIVhIud06  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2016

The decision to go against the idea of an individual mandate is new for Trump, who told CNN during a February town hall before the South Carolina primary that he likes the mandate and that makes him a little bit different than other conservatives.

But Wednesdays plan outlines as the first point on the list: Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to.

He counters that, however, by saying individuals should be allowed to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns.

The third bullet point goes on to say that we must make sure no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance and that we must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it.

Further, Trump ties illegal immigration to his healthcare plan, writing providing healthcare to illegal immigrants costs us some $11 billion annually ... If we were to simply enforce the current immigration laws and restrict the unbridled granting of visas to this country, we could relieve healthcare cost pressures on state and local governments.

Trump, who after almost every mass shooting has responded to questions on gun control with an answer about mental health, also noted the need for mental health institution reform. His plan states that [f]amilies, without the ability to get the information needed to help those who are ailing, are too often not given the tool to help their loved ones. Beyond this statement, however, Trump gives no solution. Instead, writing that there are promising reforms being developed in Congress that should receive bi-partisan support.

Another recent talking point that has made its way into the healthcare plan is pharmaceutical drugs, special interest control of prices, and the need to be able to negotiate. Though this talking point seemed to stem from former Bush finance chairman Woody Johnsons attendance to a GOP debate, Trump has since included the need to negotiate prices and unleash Washington from its special interest hold.

msnbc.com,,Michigan win rescues Bernie Sanders' campaign,[],"CLEVELAND  Bernie Sanders scored a critical upset in Michigans Democratic primary Tuesday, winning a narrow victory over front-runner Hillary Clinton in a state where polls had showed him far behind, and proving once again to be a competitor when most had counted him out.

The Vermont senator is still miles from catching up to Clinton, who won a commanding victory in Mississippis primary Tuesday night and holds a significant delegate lead. Sanders headed into Tuesdays contests about 200 delegates behind Clinton, not including so-called superdelegates, and desperately needed a win to remain a legitimate contender in the race.

The Michigan victory, Sanders first in a big and relatively diverse state, buys his campaign a lifeline and puts him back on a path that could at least conceivably end in him accepting the Democratic presidential nomination in July. And it underscores still lingering weaknesses with Clintons candidacy.

Just as Clinton and her allies began moving to ease Sanders aside and prepare for the general election, the results in Michigan suddenly make next Tuesdays contests here in Ohio, and in Missouri and Illinois, seem more competitive. view photo essay The presidential campaign: Bernie Sanders The self-described democratic socialist is known for pushing change on income inequality, college affordability and criminal justice reform.

This was a fantastic night, Sanders said at a late night press conference in Miami, which his campaign scrambled to assemble hours after he had given his formal remarks for the night. Our strongest areas are yet to happen.

It also adds new urgency and relevance to the next Democratic debate, scheduled for Wednesday night in Miami.

His advisers had long predicted the beginning of March would be rough for them, thanks to the high concentration of southern states with large African-American populations that so far have favored Clinton by wide margins. But with those states now in the rear view mirror, Sanders campaign expects to sail into friendlier waters later in the month, beginning next Tuesday. The campaign has even begun to eye North Carolina, which also votes that day, but will likely lag in Florida, a delegate treasure trove where Clinton is heavily favored.

Clintons campaign tried to appear unrattled by Tuesdays outcome, saying the delegate count would ultimately still favor them. Because delegates are awarded proportionally in the Democratic nominating process, her 67 point margin in Mississippi means she will likely rack up a larger net gain Tuesday, even after losing Michigan. Sanders never meaningfully competed in Mississippi.

We feel confident she is going to be the nominee, but the race will continue to be competitive through the next week, Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters at a Clinton rally in Cleveland Tuesday night. We would like to wrap it up as soon as possible because you dont want the Republican nominee to get, if they wrap up soon, we dont want to be far behind them.

Operatives with both campaigns, the press, and virtually the entire world headed into Tuesday night seemingly convinced that a win for Sanders was out of reach in Michigan  and thus probably for his entire campaign. The Real Clear Politics average of recent polls gave Clinton a 21.4 point lead going into primary day.

After Sundays debate in Flint, reporters covering the Sanders campaign questioned how much longer they would be assigned to it after the Vermont senator turned in a debate performance that, while feisty, included some real flubs like defending his vote against the TARP bailout plan in 2009 that included hundreds of millions of dollars of relief for Michigans troubled auto industry.

But the voters of Michigan had other ideas, and the night stretched on with polls too close to call long after both Sanders and Clinton had spoken and their supporters went home.

If Michigan is in play, Ohio is in play, said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal group that has not endorsed either Sanders or Clinton. Both candidates have an incentive to continue engaging in a race to the top on Elizabeth Warren-style economic populism issues.



Sanders was boosted in Michigan by young people and independent voters in the states open primary. And he did much better among African-Americans in Michigan than he did southern states, as his operatives had long expected, though he still fell behind Clinton.

Bernie closed a big gap, and he closed it fast, said Joe Dinkin, a spokesman for the Working Families Party, a progressive group that endorsed Sanders and boosted his grassroots effort. Tonight, the Sanders campaign proved once again that you shouldnt count them out  because the political revolution is spreading fast.",[]

Both Clinton and Sanders have called on Snyder to resign, and some here privately say they hope for a worse fate than even prison for the governor.

Snyder responded to the criticism by saying he will be here long after Clinton and Sanders head out of town. In a few days, political candidates will be leaving Flint and Michigan, he said on Twitter. They will not be staying to help solve the crisis, but I am committed to the people of Flint.

The candidates insisted otherwise. I will be with Flint all the way through this crisis, Clinton pledged during the debate.

At the Sanders field office in downtown Flint, theres a pile of water bottles in the corner and a sign out front that marks the location as a distribution point. When they set it up in early February, so many people came in asking for water that the campaign started giving it away, a supporter explained, as does Clintons Flint field office about 2.5 miles away.

Inside, and around town, some said their view on politics turned more radical after the water crisis. This is Flint, Michigan. Weve always been kind of the forgotten city, said John Gagnon, a die-hard Sanders volunteer. Hes been working at Sanders field office every day since it opened, even while hes finishing college and working as a engineer for a General Motors supplier.

Overall, Michigan voters were full of surprises in its presidential primary Tuesday night, handing an upset victory to Bernie Sanders and launching Donald Trump to win three states throughout the night. The pair of wins keep alive a presidential contest already chock-full of unpredictable turns, keeping Sanders in the race while many had already counted him out, and setting up Trump perilously close to running away with the Republican nomination.

The most fascinating results came out of Dearborn, where about 41 percent of voters are Arab-American. Sanders claimed an uncontested lead there with 59 percent of the vote to Hillary Clintons 39 percent.

Sanders had focused much of his campaigning efforts in Dearborn, holding events there twice over the last month to blast Clinton for her role in Libyas regime change and her record on trade. Over that time he released a radio ad in Arabic that also condemned his Republican opponents and cast himself as a voice of inclusion. And in his final swing through Michigan on Monday night, Sanders told the crowd that he had met with Arab-American leaders and vowed that Trump and his supporters were not going prevail in scapegoating minority communities.

We are going to end bigotry in this country once and for all, Sanders said during the rally.

Even more surprising were Trumps results on the Republican side. There he came ahead of runner-up John Kasich by roughly 10 points, with 39 percent to the Ohio governors 29 percent.

The candidate split comes amid a heightened climate of Islamophobia as the Arab-American community has been forced to shoulder much of the publics anxiety toward terror groups abroad and fear of more attacks. Muslim leaders have reported a number of potential hate crimes and attacks against the community throughout the U.S.

And yet, in a state with a deep history of acceptance toward the Arab community, Michigan Republicans reflected the feelings shared by an astounding majority of GOP voters  they support Trumps plan to temporarily ban Muslims, who are not U.S. citizens, from entering the country.

According to exit polls, 63 percent of Republican voters supported the proposal, 46 percent of which were Trump supporters, compared to 32 percent who said they were opposed.",[]

view photo essay The presidential campaign: Marco Rubio Because of his youth and relatively moderate campaign rhetoric, Rubio is often touted as the Republican Partys best hope of appealing to younger voters.

Rubios sudden shift to aggressively attacking Trump one week before the Super Tuesday primary contests saw the candidate mock Trump on the debate stage and during nearly every one of his stump speeches following. The attacks took a personal turn, with Rubio making fun of Trumps tan, his hair and ultimately the size of his hands  a veiled jab at Trumps manhood  at a rally shortly before voters went to the polls that week.

The strategy won him wall-to-wall media coverage but did little to cement Rubio as the anointed alternative to Trump. Indeed, it appears to have hurt him, as he struggled to overcome Ted Cruz during the Super Tuesday contests and his support has since cratered, resulting in disappointing finishes in primaries across the nation over the past week. Some Republicans have criticized Rubio for damaging the image of the Republican Party, as major Republican donor Fred Malek put it on MSNBC this week.

Rubios comments Wednesday were an implicit acknowledgment that the strategy didnt work, and he has since shifted away from personal attacks on Trump in favor of more policy-focused fare. But he insisted that it was appropriate to point out that Trump is portraying himself as something hes not, a central focus of his argument against the GOP frontrunner.

msnbc.com,,Another Christie childhood friend witnessed traffic surge,[],"On Sunday, the Port Authoritys executive director Pat Foye issued an investigation into the new report that a Port Authority police officer, with personal ties to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, was at the George Washington Bridge when access lanes were closed last September. A new paper trail indicates the officer drove David Wildstein, the Christie appointee who supervised the closings, on a tour of the area as traffic brought it to a standstill.

Foye requested the agencys inspector general investigate the reported actions of police officers who were at the bridge during the lane closures, according to a source close to the Police Department.

Documents submitted to a New Jersey legislative committee by Wildstein also show that the officer, Lieutenant Thomas Chip Michaels, appears to have sent periodic text messages to Wildstein updating him on the effects of the lane closures and their crippling impact on the town of Fort Lee. In one message, on the first day of the lane closures, Michaels told Wildstein he might have an idea to make this better. It is not clear what he meant.

Close video Longtime Christie friend at lane closures Steve Kornacki breaks down the relationship between a Port Authority police officer, his longtime friendship with Gov. Chris Christie and his connection to the Fort Lee lane closure scandal. embed like save share group

Michaels, who joined the Port Authority Police Department in 1998 according to payroll records, grew up in Christie and Wildsteins hometown of Livingston, N.J. In recent years, he coached Christies son at little league hockey. Michaels brother, Jeffrey Michaels is among the most powerful Republicans in New Jersey politics  a lobbyist whose practice has soared in value during the Christie years and who has donated heavily to pro-Christie organizations.

Michaels presence at the lane closures with Wildstein is an important new detail because it places another person with long-time ties to the governor, this time in the Port Authority Police Department, at the scene witnessing the traffic surge that has since come to engulf Chrsties administration in legal inquires.

The revelation is also important because Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich had earlier questioned the Port Authority Police Departments actions during the closures. In a September 12 letter, Sokolich wrote to Port Authority deputy executive director Bill Baroni, a Christie appointee who has since resigned, that residents had told him that Port Authority Police Officers are advising commuters in response to their complaints that this recent traffic debacle is the result of a decision that I, as the Mayor, recently made. There is no evidence that Michaels was one of these officers.

In a statement released Monday, the Christie administration said the governor has never had any conversations with either Jeff or Chip Michaels on this topic. Christie emphatically denies taking part in or having any knowledge of the decision to close the lanes leading onto one of the busiest bridge in the world. He has said he doesnt know why members of his inner circle would have ordered the lanes closed.

After e-mails surfaced last month revealing his top aides discussed and apparently took part in the lane closures, Christie fired his deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly and cut ties with Bill Stepien, one of his top political lieutenants. Wildstein, who served as director of interstate capital projects, resigned from the Port Authority in December. In a recent letter to the Authority, Wildsteins lawyer asserted that evidence exists showing that Christie knew of the lane closures while they were happening.

The governors office, Christies reelection campaign, and multiple top aides have been subpoenaed by the state legislative committee investigating the lane closures. A separate inquiry is underway at the U.S. Attorneys office, which is looking into the lane closures and also into allegations made by the mayor of Hoboken, N.J., that Christie officials threatened to withhold Sandy relief money from her city unless she moved forward with a redevelopment project represented by the law firm of one of Christies top political allies, Port Authority Chairman David Samson. The Governors office has denied any linkage between the project and Sandy money.

In 2010, a Newark Star-Ledger article described the Christie-Michaels family friendship as one that has endured for decades.

We break his chops a little bit, just saying, Youre the Governor?, looking at him laughing, Chip Michaels told the paper. Its crazy. He grew up like everyone else in New Jersey. So to see him as a celebrity, its just really odd. But hes the same guy. Hes a grounded guy. At the time the article was published, Michaels was coaching one of Christies sons in a youth hockey league. The article described a friendship dating back to their childhoods.

Multiple attempts to reach Chip Michaels directly and through the Port Authority were unsuccessful. The Port Authority Police Department has not returned calls for comment. Messages and emails sent to Jeffrey Michaels were not responded to.

Chip Michaels presence at the bridge at the time of the lane closures came to light during a review of documents that were subpoenaed by the New Jersey State Assemblys Transportation Committee late last year and released publicly in early January.

It was previously known that Wildstein and Robert Durando, the general manager of the George Washington Bridge, were present when the lane closures went into effect at 6:00 A.M. on September 9. In testimony before the Transportation Committee last December, Durando said that Wildstein had also met up with a Port Authority police lieutenant to tour the area.

He [Wildstein] came to the facility on Monday morning, Durando testified. He stood at the communications desk for a little while  its an area with cameras to look out at the various roadways  limited view, albeit. He stayed there for a little while. He then left the facility, left the communications desk with a police lieutenant assigned to the George Washington Bridge, to ride around the facility for some period of time to see the impact on traffic.

Among Wildsteins subpoenaed documents from that morning is a text message exchange with someone offering to pick him up in the parking lot at the Port Authority offices at the bridge. Wildstein replied: Im with Bob which presumably refers to Robert Durando. In the exchange, Wildstein told the person  whose identity was redacted by Wildsteins lawyer  that he would be ready around 7:30.

In an email sent at 7:28am, which was also was included in subpoenaed materials, Wildstein informed Durando that he was leaving to take a ride with Chip, seemingly indicating that Chip Michaels was the person Wildstein had been texting with earlier.

The night before the closures went into effect, documents show that Chip Michaels emailed his superior, Captain Darcy Licorish, to ask if a new traffic pattern was going into effect the following morning. From the redactions in the documents Wildstein shared, it appears he and Michaels had previously been exchanging text messages on a possibly unrelated matter.

On the first morning of the lane closures, text messages appear to show Michaels telling Wildstein before they went for their ride-around, that its [expletive] up here.

Fort Lee Police Chief Keith Bendul told msnbc that Michaels was one of three Port Authority Police officials he reached out to on the morning of the lane closures as he unsuccessfully tried to contain the impact on the area.

Michaels brother Jeffrey Michaels served as the chief of staff to Republican Gov. Donald DiFrancesco just over a decade ago before transitioning into lobbying. When Christie ran for governor in 2009, Jeffrey Michaels served as a campaign adviser. According to journalist Bob Ingles 2012 biography of Christie, it was Jeffrey Michaels who delivered the good news to Christie on election night that he had won.

In a public television interview after that election, Jeffrey Michaels was asked how close he is to Christie. Ive known him for a long time, he said. We went to high school with  we  our families knew each other from Livingston, and just stayed in close contact with him over the years and was very pleased to help his campaign out with policy.

Once Christie became governor, Jeffrey Michaels newly-created lobbying venture flourished. Teaming up with Phil Norcross  who is the brother of George Norcross, the preeminent Democratic power-broker in the state and a not-so-secret ally of Christies  Jeffrey Michaels launched Optimus Partners L.L.C. In just one year his lobbying revenue increased by a factor of seven, according to a 2011 report in Philadelphia Inquirer.

Attempts to reach Jeffrey Michaels through his office were unsuccessful. Local reports and I.R.S. filings show that Jeffrey Michaels has donated extensively to pro-Christie groups, including $25,000 to a PAC created to push the governors agenda and $20,450 since October 2012 to the Republican Governors Association, the organization Christie is now heading as he explores a possible 2016 presidential bid.",[]

msnbc.com,,Prosecutors renew request for Apple to open iPhone in Brooklyn case,['Pete Williams'],"The Justice Department Monday asked a federal judge to force Apple to help investigators open the iPhone of a suspected Brooklyn drug dealer.

Prosecutors are seeking to overturn last weeks ruling from a federal magistrate denying the governments request. Mondays step is, in essence, the first step in an appeal.

RELATED: Apple doesnt have to help in NY iPhone case, judge says

In light of the debate that has recently come to surround this issue, it is worth briefly noting what this case is not about. Apple is not being asked to do anything it does not currently have the capability to do, the Justice Departments court filing said.

The Brooklyn case involves an older model device, an iPhone 5s, running an older version of the operating system, iOS 7. For that reason, prosecutors said, Apple is not required to write new software to allow investigators to unlock the phone.

This is a substantial difference from the controversy over the iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino attackers, which was running iOS 8. In order to allow FBI agents to try thousands of combinations of passcodes to open that device, Apple would have to install new software to disable the security functions on the phone.

Close video Apple CEO fights order to unlock shooters iPhone Apple CEO Tim Cook is in a heated standoff with the government after a judge ordered him to unlock an iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino shooters. NBCs Justice Correspondent Pete Williams joins Andrea Mitchell to explain this privacy versus... embed like save share group

The company has argued that such a step would create a master key, jeopardizing the security of millions of iPhones worldwide.

In the Brooklyn case, by contrast, no such new software would be required.

Apple may perform the passcode-bypass in its own lab, using its own technicians, just as it always has, without revealing to the government how it did so. Therefore, granting the application will not affect the technological security of any Apple iPhone nor hand the government a master key, the governments brief said.

Apples lawyers said last month that they have consistently agreed to extract data from older locked phones when served with a lawful court order. But the company stopped doing so after the magistrate judge in Brooklyn last October questioned the court procedure used by the Justice Department.

Lawyers for Apple have not yet responded to the governments new request.

msnbc.com,,Study finds Zika damages babies at all stages of pregnancy,['Maggie Fox'],"The babies of women infected with Zika virus while they are pregnant can suffer the effects at any stage of gestation, researchers reported Friday in a troubling look at how Zika affects unborn children.

Two babies died just before they should have been born after their mothers became infected, the international team found. They also found the virus causes a range of birth defects beyond microcephaly.

They suggest a name for these effects: Zika virus congenital syndrome. Babies have been born with a range of brain and eye defects and some have also been abnormally small.

The findings, together with other studies, support what most experts already believe: that Zika is causing an epidemic of birth defects.

Earlier Friday, a different team reported that tests in lab dishes show that Zika goes straight into developing brain cells and turns them into virus factories before killing them.

And the findings strongly support the idea that Zika, a once-obscure virus believed to cause little more than a headache and a rash, can be a killer.

RELATED: Mysteries of the Zika virus stump even the experts

Despite mild clinical symptoms, Zika virus infection during pregnancy appears to be associated with grave outcomes, including fetal death, placental insufficiency, fetal growth restriction and central nervous system injury, they wrote in their report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

We saw problems with the fetus or the pregnancy at eight weeks, 22 weeks, 25 weeks, and we saw problems at 35 weeks, said Dr. Karin Nielsen, professor of clinical pediatrics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles, who helped organize the study.

Even if the fetus isnt affected the virus appears to damage the placenta, which can lead to fetal death, Nielsen said. Two babies died just days before they were due.

Any woman with Zika virus should be handled as a high-risk pregnancy, Nielsen told NBC News.

Theres more than microcephaly. There is a spectrum of disease. There are parts of the brain that are not formed. There are calcifications in the brain. There is in-utero growth restriction.

Many of the symptoms are similar to whats been seen when women get rubella while pregnant, including microcephaly, marked by a smaller than normal brain and head. Children who survive birth with microcephaly can grow up with often profound physical and mental disabilities.

Calcifications are hardened remnants of dead tissue. Other studies have shown that Zika in the brains of some babies miscarried or aborted after a mother was infected.

Nielsen was working with Dr. Patricia Brasil and colleagues at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro. They were already running a study of dengue virus, asking pregnant women to come in and be tested if they showed symptoms of dengue, such as a rash.

RELATED: US athletes should consider not attending Olympics if they fear Zika: Officials

Dengue is related to Zika and its spread by the same mosquitoes, the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that spread Zika. And like Zika, dengue is spreading fast across Brazil and other Latin American countries.

So Nielsens team was up and running when Zika started causing alarm. They tested blood and urine from 88 women between September and February. More than 80 percent of the women with symptoms such as fever and rash tested positive for Zika in the blood, urine or both.

The women were at various stages of pregnancy. Nielsens team was able to follow them in real time to see what happened to their pregnancies. They found 29 percent of the fetuses had some sort of problem, from brain damage to damage to the placenta.

Nielsens study is the first to show what happens from the time a woman becomes infected. That can answer one big question: when the most dangerous time of pregnancy is.

We know when the infection is taking place, she said. We can associate that with weeks of gestation, so we can know if there are any malformations, what time they happened  we can associate them with a first trimester, second trimester and third trimester infection.

The answers are not reassuring. The experts have predicted that the first trimester would be the most dangerous time for a fetus if a woman became infected. But Nielsens team found babies were hurt even late in pregnancy.

One important finding was that there were problems with pregnancy in the third trimester as well, which was surprising to us, she said.

Some had looked normal on ultrasound, even, before they died in the womb. It is not normal to find two fetal deaths that late in pregnancy in that small a group of women, she said.

The team is studying the babies to see if they can find out why they died. And theyre watching the rest of the pregnant women to see what happens.

World Health Organization and Brazilian health officials are worried. Theyve seen more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly in recent months, and more than a million people have been infected. Colombia, the second Latin American country to get hit with Zika, has started to report Zika-linked cases of microcephaly.

This virus hit in a perfect storm, Nielsen said. You are talking about a very large population in Brazil. When you have a lot of people infected, you are going to see problems.

msnbc.com,,"First Read: 2016 momentum shifts, but not the math",[],"First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the days most important political stories and why they matter.

Momentum shifts in both presidential races, but not the math view photo essay The presidential campaign: Donald Trump Make America Great Again.

Last nights primary and caucus results changed the momentum in both presidential races. But they didnt significantly alter the overall math and trajectory of the two contests. Lets start with the Republican race. Donald Trump headed into last night losing some steam after Ted Cruzs gains over the weekend. And what did Trump do? He won the Michigan and Mississippi primaries by double digits over Cruz, and he even triumphed in Hawaiis caucuses. (Trumps one loss came in Idaho, where Cruz beat him, 45%-28%.) Still, the results dont truly change the overall math for Trump: He still needs to win Florida and/or Ohio to be on a stronger path to the 1,237 delegates needed to capture the GOP nomination. The good news for him: His top competition in Florida (Marco Rubio) and Ohio (John Kasich) certainly dont have the political winds at their backs. Heres the GOP delegate math:

Trump needs to win 52% of remaining delegates to reach 1,237 magic number

Trump needs to win 59% of remaining delegates to reach 1,237 magic number

Trump needs to win 69% of remaining delegates to reach 1,237 magic number

Bernies YUGE win and YUGE delegate deficit

As for the Democratic race, Bernie Sanders got a huge  YUGE  win in Michigan, defying the pundits and the polls. We called it a last stand of sorts for his campaign, and it won the battle in surprising fashion. And now he has momentum heading into next weeks contest in Ohio. But Sanders has two problems: One, he actually lost ground in pledged delegates (due to Hillary Clintons big win in Mississippi). And two, next week doesnt just feature Ohio  its also Florida, Illinois, Missouri, and North Carolina, where well likely see Clinton increase her delegate lead. The current math after last night: Clinton leads Sanders among pledged delegates by 761-547. And among all delegates (including superdelegates), its 1193-569. To reach the magic number, Sanders will need to win 60% of all remaining delegates.

Hillary wont be able to shake Sanders anytime soon

Despite that math, however, Clinton doesnt seem likely to shake Sanders anytime soon, especially with the kind of money Sanders is raising. In a way, she is Mitt Romney of 2012 (the sure bet to be the nominee, but who has to grind it out), and Sanders is Rick Santorum (who has a big chunk of the base on his side). Of course, Sanders has A LOT more money than Santorum ever did. On Monday, Clinton told Michigan voters, The sooner I could become your nominee, the more I could begin to turn attention to the Republicans. Her problem: She still has to worry about Sanders.

The importance of open vs. closed primaries

One of the big secrets to Trumps and Sanders success last night was the open nature of last nights primaries in Mississippi and Michigan. In Michigan, 31% of the voters were independents, and Trump bested Kasich among them, 36%-27%. And on the Democratic side in Michigan, Clinton won Democrats by a 57%-41% margin, but Sanders won among indies (who made up 28% of the electorate), 71%-28%. Looking ahead to next weeks contests, Florida is a closed primary, while Ohio isnt as open as Michigan is. Per Ohios election law, you declare your political party affiliation by requesting the ballot of a political party in a partisan primary election. If you do not desire to affiliate with a political party in Ohio, you are considered to be an unaffiliated voter. An unaffiliated voter does not vote the ballot of a political party in a primary election. However, an unaffiliated voter may vote the Official Questions & Issues Ballot, if there is one for the voters precinct at the election.",[]

What keeps you motivated to work in student government?

Student government offers young people an institutional route to change-making on a local level. For many of us, ages 16-24 is the period during which we start learning to take responsibility for not only ourselves, but also those around us. For me, student government has been an opportunity to not only elevate this sense of responsibility, but also to show my respect and care for the community I live in.

What issues are you most passionate about following this election season? Why?

Theres so much to talk about! Ill pick one: college cost. Sure, we can expect students to pay for their education. But should we expect students to take out life-long loan repayment plans? Probably not. If were gonna say anyone can make a good life in America as long as they try hard enough, the people trying hard enough better be able to live decently. From the perspective of foster youth, native youth, black or brown students, and low-income students more broadly, cost is just one more barrier to entry  Im interested in hearing clever, reasonable strategies for building a better higher education system from the front runners.

Has feminism played a role in your life? If so, how?

Of course! Feminism, as a broader social movement for liberation, has a long, complex history in the United States. While mainstream (#leanin) feminism taught me how to bring my A-game in a workplace culture historically built to prioritize male-associated gender norms, I think its important to recognize the mixed-nature of this kind of feminism. It operates to the disadvantage of less wealthy, women of color and gender non-conforming people. Folks in these latter categories taught me to center discussions of fairness and dessert on those who have been most systemically wronged by governmental and other social institutions. With this lens, we might envision policy initiatives that have broader-reaching impact.

Have you ever been in a protest? If so, how was it and how has it affected your leadership work?

Good question. Yes. There are many important avenues for engaging your community and your state in an effort to seek political change. Public protest is one of these avenues. The most formative protest I participated in was in conjunction with Black Lives Matters call to #ReclaimMLK on MLK weekend last year. The decision to partake and the experience itself helped me define my commitment to undermining race-based injustices. More importantly, it taught me how to be a better ally to black and brown activists in their struggle to end ongoing state violence against their communities.

If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go and why?

Sagar and Ahmedabad, Gujarat, Central India. My parents are both from the state of Gujarat in India, where they grew up and spent their early adulthood. The last time I visited their hometowns I was seven years old. Now that Im a bit older, I think I could appreciate, learn more, and ask the right questions to better understand how my parents experience in Gujarat affected their lives and careers here in the United States. Plus, from what I remember, Ahmedabads street food has endless, delicious vegetarian options!

msnbc.com,,Flint finally suspends water utility billing amid lead crisis,['Phil Helsel'],"view photo essay Life in Flint: A logistical, financial and health nightmare As officials search for short-term fixes and long-term answers, Flint residents are living like refugees  with no timetable for returning to normal.

The mayor of Flint, Michigan, on Wednesday announced the city will stop billing for water as it tries to implement a program designed to assist residents who have been exposed to lead poisoning.

Michigans governor last week approved a $30 million plan to help Flint residents with water bills amid the man-made disaster, Flint Mayor Karen Weaver said in a statement, and the bills are being suspended while the city tries to get that program going.

Flint residents need and deserve this relief, Weaver said. Ive said from day one, Flint residents should not have to pay for water they can not and are not using.

Residents of the city of more than 99,000 have been told not to use unfiltered tap water after a switch of the citys municipal water source to the Flint River exposed them to high levels of lead.

RELATED: Flint prepares for the political spotlight to fade

The problem was exacerbated by local government resistance to warnings, the Environmental Protection Agency has said. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder has called the debacle a failure at every level of government and has vowed to help the city. The city has since switched back to Detroit water but corrupted pipes remain an issue.

Meanwhile, the state of Michigans outside legal fees related to the ongoing Flint lead-contaminated water crisis could climb as high as $2.7 million, Snyders office said Tuesday.

The fees are to be paid with public money. Snyders office previously estimated the states legal fees at $1 million in February.

msnbc.com,,Obama to skip Nancy Reagan's funeral to attend South by Southwest,['Elizabeth Chuck'],"President Barack Obama will not attend Nancy Reagans funeral on Friday, opting instead to speak at a festival in Austin, Texas.

South by Southwest  an annual music, tech, and film gathering  announced last week that Obama would be the keynote speaker on March 11, and that Michelle Obama was scheduled to speak on March 16. Its the first time in the festivals 30-year history that a sitting president and first lady have participated.

Michelle Obama will be at the former first ladys funeral, which will be held at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California. But White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed Tuesday that President Obama wont be there.

RELATED: 1950s movie co-star remembers Nancy Reagan

The president will not attend, he said at the daily White House briefing. The president is traveling in Texas.

Reagan, 94, died Saturday of congestive heart failure. She will be buried beside her husband, former President Ronald Reagan.

This isnt the first notable funeral in recent weeks that Obama has missed: Last month, Obama skipped Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalias funeral, choosing to paying his respects the day before while Scalias body lay in repose. Vice President Joe Biden was at the funeral itself.

In a statement after her death, the Obamas said they were grateful for Nancy Reagans life.

Nancy Reagan once wrote that nothing could prepare you for living in the White House. She was right, of course. But we had a head start, because we were fortunate to benefit from her proud example, and her warm and generous advice, they said.

Presidents do not always attend former first ladies funerals, although current and former first ladies usually do. When Betty Ford died in 2011, neither Obama nor former President Bill Clinton went to her funeral. Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and former first lady Rosalynn Carter did; former President George W. Bush was also there, accompanied by Nancy Reagan.

msnbc.com,,Rubio sinks in Florida as Cruz challenges his anti-Trump strategy,[],"Miami  Sen. Ted Cruz smells blood in the water.

A day after rival Sen. Marco Rubio limped through four state contests and six days before Floridas winner-take-all primary, Cruz held a small rally in his rivals hometown of Miami, just blocks from where Rubio announced his campaign in April.

There is only one campaign that has demonstrated it can beat Donald Trump over and over and over again  and we will beat Donald Trump over and over and over again, Cruz told an enthusiastic crowd of supporters at Miami Dade College.

While Cruz never called out his fellow senator by name, the message was clear: Rubio has to go.

RELATED: Rubio says hes not entirely proud of personal attacks against Trump

Late that day, Rubio assured supporters at a dusk rally in nearby Hialeah that he would not drop out this week. He warned of rumors from opponents suggesting otherwise.

I will be on the ballot on Tuesday, he said. I will campaign as long and as hard as it takes.

The event, however, did little to dispel the notion that his campaign was on the ropes.

view photo essay The presidential campaign: Marco Rubio Because of his youth and relatively moderate campaign rhetoric, Rubio is often touted as the Republican Partys best hope of appealing to younger voters.

Hialeah is a blue-collar city where Rubio won his first state House race and politicians switch freely between Spanish and English, but the crowd barely filled the end zone of the rallys football stadium venue. Rubio opened his remarks by noting the events 5 p.m. time made it hard for supporters to leave work early to attend.

The news leading up to the event was grim. Three polls that day showed Rubio behind Trump in Florida by a roughly two-to-one margin. Shortly before the event, Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin a longtime Rubio booster  called on him to drop out of the race and endorse Cruz. When Fox News host Megyn Kelly joined Rubio onstage for a live interview at his rally, most of the questions were about whether he was preparing to exit the race.

I think the nominee has to win Florida, Rubio told her. You cant be the Republican nominee if you dont win Florida and I am going to do everything I can to win this state.

In the short term, Wednesdays Florida face-off between Cruz and Rubio was less about a dispute over philosophy and records, and more about the best way to stop Trump from becoming the nominee.

Led by former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, some Republicans have called on voters to rally behind Rubio in Florida and Kasich in Ohio on Tuesday regardless of their personal preference in the hopes that theyll win both states and force Trump into a contested convention. The more candidates who stay in the race, the easier it should be to deny him a winning majority.

RELATED: Marco Rubios campaign is on life support

Echoing Romney, Rubio directly appealed to Florida voters on Wednesday to support his campaign on pure strategic grounds  even if hes not their favored candidate.

If you dont want Donald Trump to be the nominee, even if youre a supporter of Ted Cruz or even if youre a supporter of John Kasich, you vote for Marco Rubio because a vote for anyone other than me is a vote for Donald Trump, he said Wednesday at an MSNBC town hall with Chuck Todd in Miami.

Cruz has a much simpler plan: Just line up behind the guy with the most delegates after Trump  Cruz has 359 to Rubios 151  and force the front-runner into a one-on-one contest.

Donald wants the other candidates to remain in the race because it splinters his opposition, Cruz told reporters. When the opposition unifies, Donald loses.

As Cruz noted on Wednesday, an NBC News/WSJ poll this week found Trump behind Cruz 57 to 40 among Republicans when matched up individually, which could hint at a possible late winning streak if the field narrows. Former Republican presidential rival Carly Fiorina, who endorsed Cruz at his event, told the audience it was time to unite behind Ted Cruz.

All of this made perfect sense to attendees at Cruzs rally, who said they were furious with Romneys meddling.

It was the most tone deaf thing Ive heard out of Washington yet, Linda Burke, 71, said.

Several voiced suspicions that the Romney plan was intended to clear the path for an establishment-friendly nominee  perhaps even Romney himself  rather than merely head off Trump.

I dont think hes being honest about whats driving his strategy, Bruce Zwigard, 67, said.  Hes not for Cruz. He didnt say it, but its implied.

Cruz insists he was targeting Florida with victory in mind, but if his goal is to winnow the field, then knocking out Rubio on Tuesday is the logical play, even if it makes things easier for Trump in the short term.

We are begging God for Rubio to drop out, Osmani Gonzales, a 44-year-old technician said clasping his hands and looking to the sky in mock prayer.

The Romney/Rubio plan to carve up the nations delegates might make sense on paper, but the logic starts to fall apart if any of the candidates stop being competitive.

RELATED: Cruz picks up support from Fiorina, but not Republican colleagues

On Tuesday, Rubio won zero delegates across four races, meaning he contributed nothing to help fight Trump in Julys convention, while still sucking up votes that might have helped other non-Trump candidates.

Given the results, some voters on Wednesday said they were leaning toward Cruz simply because it was the sounder strategic move in the fight against Trump.

Ill do anything that will work against Trump, Jorge Lendeborg, a political consultant focused on Hispanic voters, said at Cruzs rally. Cruz has a better chance and its time to support him.

I lean Rubio, but Cruz is leading, Peter Smith, 23, said as he waited in line at Rubios event. For the sake of party, he has the best chance of beating Trump.

For months, Rubio benefitted from his appeal to voters as the electability candidate who offered the best chance to block Cruz or Trump in the primaries and then defeat Democrats in the general. Now hes experiencing the downside of his broad appeal, as voters who lined up behind him with hopes of victory find little reason to stick with him if he cant promise it any longer.

Cruz survived a string of disappointing losses in numerous key states thanks to a solid base of conservatives who vote for him on ideological grounds regardless of his performance. Rubio, who crashed to 5 percent support in Mississippi on Tuesday, has no such floor of support  maybe not even in his home state.

While Rubio tried to fill the void in recent weeks by redefining himself as an anti-Trump insult comic, the jarring shift in tone rubbed voters the wrong way.

I dont understand his latest tactic of personal jabs at Trump, Rubio supporter Natasha Davidson, 21, complained at his rally. You cant trump Trump.

Rubio conceded the mistake on Wednesday, telling Todd his kids were embarrassed after he mocked Trumps physical appearance and that he regretted not solely focusing on his substantive critique of Trumps record.

Its not what we want from our next president, and if I had to do it again I would have done that part differently, he said.

msnbc.com,,Where have all the popular candidates gone?,[],"First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the days most important political stories and why they matter.

Where have all the popular candidates gone?

Almost a year since the first Democrats and Republicans announced their presidential bid and another eight months until the general election, its striking how unpopular the remaining candidates are, especially compared with past presidential field. Just look at the positive-negative ratings (among all registered voters) for some of the top political figures in the latest NBC/WSJ poll:

Trumps -39 score  the lowest in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll for a major presidential candidate  is a drop of eight points from a month ago; Rubio declined from -3 in February to -11 now (maybe thats why he admitted that his family was embarrassed by his personal attacks on Trump); and Clintons numbers have been stuck in the mud since last summer, when the email controversy became a big story. And its probably not a coincidence that the two most popular candidates  Kasich and Sanders  have faced the fewest attacks during the entire campaign.

To me, this is the low point

Now compare those scores above with the positive-negative scores for past presidential candidates at this same point in time:

March 2008: John McCain 47%-27%, Barack Obama 49%-32%, Hillary Clinton 45%-43%

March 2004: John Kerry 42%-30%

March 2000: George W. Bush 45%-32%, Al Gore 44%-34%

March 1996: Bob Dole 35%-39%

April 1992: Bill Clinton 32%-43%

The only ones who come close to todays negative scores are Bill Clinton (-11) and Bob Dole (-4). Ive been doing this 1964, which is the Goldwater years, said NBC/WSJ co-pollster Peter Hart (D). To me, this is the low point. Ive seen the disgust and the polarization. Never, never seen anything like this. Theyre not going up; theyre going down. And its not only the positive-negative scores: 52% of all voters said they couldnt see themselves supporting Sanders; 56% said they couldnt see themselves supporting Clinton; 56% said they couldnt see themselves supporting Rubio; 58% said they couldnt see themselves supporting Cruz; and 67% said they couldnt see themselves supporting Trump.

Doing the delegate math on the Republican side

Here are our updated figures after a few more delegates were allocated from Tuesday night:

Trump needs to win 52% of remaining delegates to reach 1,237 magic number

Trump needs to win 59% of remaining delegates to reach 1,237 magic number

Trump needs to win 69% of remaining delegates to reach 1,237 magic number

Doing the delegate math on the Democratic side

Hillary Clinton holds a 215-delegate lead over Sanders among pledged delegates, 762-547. And among all delegates (including superdelegates), its 1194-569. To reach the magic number, Sanders will need to win 60% of all remaining delegates.

Recapping last nights Dem debate

NBCs Alex Seitz-Wald and Amanda Sakuma wrap last nights Democratic debate: Facing questions in English and Spanish at the debate, hosted by Univision and The Washington Post, Clinton and Sanders drew a sharp line in the sand on deportation policies, which could haunt them down the road: Both pledged they would not deport children nor undocumented adults without criminal records. More: Sanders hit Clinton with her infamous bungled answer on drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants in a 2008 Democratic primary, which has continued to haunt her long after she walked it back. Clinton countered with Sanders vote against a 2007 immigration law backed by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. Sanders said he voted against the law because it included a guest worker program that many Latino and civil rights group opposed. And: Asked if she would drop out of the race if she were to be indicted for having classified information on her server, she replied curtly: Oh for goodness  that is not going to happen, Im not going to answer that question. But she also found a way to turn this weakness in a strength by being forthcoming and vulnerable, exposing a bit of herself voters long for in an cycle dominated by a demand for authenticity. This is not easy for me, she said. I am not a natural politician, in case you havent noticed, like my husband or President Obama.

A toned-down  and final  GOP debate?

And at 9:00 pm ET, the remaining Republicans will participate in a debate from Coral Gables, FL. Its maybe the last GOP debate, especially if Trump wins next week in Florida and Ohio. (If so, we wouldnt be surprised if he says no to future debates.) And its maybe going to be a toned-down affair after the last two raucous debates, though we wont put any money behind that prediction. Thats not something Im entirely proud of, Rubio said at last nights MSNBC town hallabout his personal attacks on Trump. My kids were embarrassed by it, and you know? If I had to do it again, I wouldnt, but not on the other charges. Not on the other things. Of course, Trump didnt necessarily tone down things yesterday. I think Islam hates us, the billionaire told CNNs Anderson Cooper when asked whether the religion was at war with the West. So many people are certain that Trump will eventually move to middle  in rhetoric and tone. But what evidence of that do we really have?

I think Islam hates us, the billionaire told CNNs Anderson Cooper when asked whether the religion was at war with the West.

We have to get to the bottom of it, Trump said. There is an unbelievable hatred of us  anybody.

He added: And we cant allow people coming into this country who have this hatred of the United States.

In December, the real-estate mogul triggered uproar when he called for a complete shutdown of Muslims entering the country.

The proposal prompted Arab billionaire Khalaf Al Habtoor to publicly withdraw his support for the American businessman.

Also on Wednesday, Trump addressed his controversial pledges that have been likened to Hitlers Nazi salute.

I probably wont ask you to pledge that youll vote for me because theyll say that it was a horrible thing, he told a rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina, referring to those who have criticized the pledge.

When the crowd booed and cheered, Trump said, You wanna do it? OK.

He added: Do you pledge that on Tuesday you will go and we will make America great again and you will vote for Donald Trump  yes?

Meanwhile, Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders bashed Trump for his comments about immigrants and minorities.

While not specifically calling him a racist, the former secretary of state said she been the first one to call [Trump] out ... when he was calling Mexicans rapists, when he was engaging in rhetoric that I found deeply offensive.

At a debate hosted by The Washington Post and Spanish-language Univision television network, Clinton said Trumps rhetoric was demagoguery, and added the GOP candidate trafficking in prejudice and paranoia has no place in our political system.

Sanders also weighed in, saying: The American people are never going to elect president who insults Mexicans, who insults Muslims, who insults women, who insults African Americans.

msnbc.com,,Republicans see political upside to Supreme Court blockade,[],"Senate Republicans have launched a Supreme Court blockade unlike anything Americans have ever seen. Nearly every GOP senator has linked arms and vowed not to consider any high court nominee, regardless of qualifications or merit, until 2017, no matter the consequences.

From practically every angle, its a dangerous, borderline scandalous, gambit that represents a new chapter in Republican radicalism, but Politico reports that some party leaders believe the unprecedented tactics will be politically beneficial for the GOP.

Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), according to GOP sources, is quietly circulating a four-page memo throughout the Senate Republican Conference on the publics views on filling the high courts vacancy. The memo, obtained by POLITICO, makes the case that a majority of voters would prefer to keep deceased Justice Antonin Scalias seat empty  for a year or even longer  rather than allow Obama to nominate a liberal justice that would move the court to the left.

Though the entire polling memo does not appear to be publicly available, the document Cornyn is distributing to his members show that 54% of respondents were more concerned about a liberal justice being chosen to replace Scalia, while nearly 41% were more worried about the seat being open for a year or more.

Its certainly possible that Senate Republicans, perhaps looking for evidence that tells them what they want to hear, will be delighted to see these results. But there are two considerations for the GOP to keep in mind.

The first is that the survey Cornyn is excited about is only one poll, and theres quite a bit of evidence pointing in a contrary direction. The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found most Americans disapprove of the Republican strategy. The latest Washington Post/ABC News poll agreed, as did Public Policy Pollings findings . A Fox News poll found that 62% of Americans expect policymakers to fill the Supreme Court vacancy this year, not next.

In other words, if Republican senators want to know if the American mainstream is on board with their obstructionist tactics, they can cling to a memo from a partisan pollster, or they can consider the results from several independent surveys.

Of course, there may be some Republican senators who say polling is irrelevant, no matter what it says. Their opposition to President Obama is so extreme, theyll remain focused on blocking the confirmation process whether its popular or not.

But for GOP senators who are worried about their re-election prospects, the risks are real. The Washington Posts Greg Sargent reported yesterday that the Democratic-affiliated Senate Majority PAC is launching a new ad in New Hampshire, which tells viewers, Donald Trump wants the Senate to delay filling the Supreme Court vacancy so he can choose the nominee next year. And Senator Kelly Ayotte is right there to help. Ayotte joined Trump and party bosses in refusing to consider any nominee.

msnbc.com,,Where have all the popular candidates gone?,[],"First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the days most important political stories and why they matter.

Where have all the popular candidates gone?

Almost a year since the first Democrats and Republicans announced their presidential bid and another eight months until the general election, its striking how unpopular the remaining candidates are, especially compared with past presidential field. Just look at the positive-negative ratings (among all registered voters) for some of the top political figures in the latest NBC/WSJ poll:

Trumps -39 score  the lowest in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll for a major presidential candidate  is a drop of eight points from a month ago; Rubio declined from -3 in February to -11 now (maybe thats why he admitted that his family was embarrassed by his personal attacks on Trump); and Clintons numbers have been stuck in the mud since last summer, when the email controversy became a big story. And its probably not a coincidence that the two most popular candidates  Kasich and Sanders  have faced the fewest attacks during the entire campaign.

To me, this is the low point

Now compare those scores above with the positive-negative scores for past presidential candidates at this same point in time:

March 2008: John McCain 47%-27%, Barack Obama 49%-32%, Hillary Clinton 45%-43%

March 2004: John Kerry 42%-30%

March 2000: George W. Bush 45%-32%, Al Gore 44%-34%

March 1996: Bob Dole 35%-39%

April 1992: Bill Clinton 32%-43%

The only ones who come close to todays negative scores are Bill Clinton (-11) and Bob Dole (-4). Ive been doing this 1964, which is the Goldwater years, said NBC/WSJ co-pollster Peter Hart (D). To me, this is the low point. Ive seen the disgust and the polarization. Never, never seen anything like this. Theyre not going up; theyre going down. And its not only the positive-negative scores: 52% of all voters said they couldnt see themselves supporting Sanders; 56% said they couldnt see themselves supporting Clinton; 56% said they couldnt see themselves supporting Rubio; 58% said they couldnt see themselves supporting Cruz; and 67% said they couldnt see themselves supporting Trump.

Doing the delegate math on the Republican side

Here are our updated figures after a few more delegates were allocated from Tuesday night:

Trump needs to win 52% of remaining delegates to reach 1,237 magic number

Trump needs to win 59% of remaining delegates to reach 1,237 magic number

Trump needs to win 69% of remaining delegates to reach 1,237 magic number

Doing the delegate math on the Democratic side

Hillary Clinton holds a 215-delegate lead over Sanders among pledged delegates, 762-547. And among all delegates (including superdelegates), its 1194-569. To reach the magic number, Sanders will need to win 60% of all remaining delegates.

Recapping last nights Dem debate

NBCs Alex Seitz-Wald and Amanda Sakuma wrap last nights Democratic debate: Facing questions in English and Spanish at the debate, hosted by Univision and The Washington Post, Clinton and Sanders drew a sharp line in the sand on deportation policies, which could haunt them down the road: Both pledged they would not deport children nor undocumented adults without criminal records. More: Sanders hit Clinton with her infamous bungled answer on drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants in a 2008 Democratic primary, which has continued to haunt her long after she walked it back. Clinton countered with Sanders vote against a 2007 immigration law backed by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. Sanders said he voted against the law because it included a guest worker program that many Latino and civil rights group opposed. And: Asked if she would drop out of the race if she were to be indicted for having classified information on her server, she replied curtly: Oh for goodness  that is not going to happen, Im not going to answer that question. But she also found a way to turn this weakness in a strength by being forthcoming and vulnerable, exposing a bit of herself voters long for in an cycle dominated by a demand for authenticity. This is not easy for me, she said. I am not a natural politician, in case you havent noticed, like my husband or President Obama.

A toned-down  and final  GOP debate?

And at 9:00 pm ET, the remaining Republicans will participate in a debate from Coral Gables, FL. Its maybe the last GOP debate, especially if Trump wins next week in Florida and Ohio. (If so, we wouldnt be surprised if he says no to future debates.) And its maybe going to be a toned-down affair after the last two raucous debates, though we wont put any money behind that prediction. Thats not something Im entirely proud of, Rubio said at last nights MSNBC town hallabout his personal attacks on Trump. My kids were embarrassed by it, and you know? If I had to do it again, I wouldnt, but not on the other charges. Not on the other things. Of course, Trump didnt necessarily tone down things yesterday. I think Islam hates us, the billionaire told CNNs Anderson Cooper when asked whether the religion was at war with the West. So many people are certain that Trump will eventually move to middle  in rhetoric and tone. But what evidence of that do we really have?

msnbc.com,,Donald Trump lands endorsement of The National Enquirer,[],"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has been leading in the polls for months, but hes just received his first endorsement from a major publication  the infamous tabloid The National Enquirer.

In this stranger-than-fiction presidential race, Trump has been championed by a publication that has recently purported to out a number of celebrities, discovered unsubstantiated cheating scandals, prematurely predicted the imminent deaths of Hillary Clinton, Angelina Jolie, Cher and Oprah Winfrey (just to name a few), claimed repeatedly that President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were on the brink of divorce, that the Obama daughters were embroiled in a cocaine scandal, and accused comedian Bill Cosby of plotting the murder of his own son.

Trump Must Be President, blasts a headline from within the Enquirers pages, which includes a list of reasons why the real the estate mogul should be elected, including: He will chase down illegal immigrants and toss out the criminals who came streaming through our open borders. That particular statement is ironic, considering the fact that the Enquirer recently published a racially insensitive article about one of its reporters dressing as a terrorist and crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, in their estimation damning evidence of how porous it is.

RELATED: Donald Trump attacks Muslims: Islam hates us

This appears to be the first time The National Enquirer has ever endorsed a candidate for president. MSNBC reached out to the tabloids parent company for comment about why the Enquirer decided to take the plunge with this years contest but has not heard back at this time.

According to The Daily Beast, the Enquirers endorsement of Trump is not surprising considering the friendly relationship he and their owner David Pecker enjoy. Trump has repeatedly sung Peckers praises on social media and has even penned self-congratulatory op-eds for the tabloid, including a three-part series under the banner The Man Behind the Legend! The Enquirer has gushed over the man who has energized millions of voters with his no-nonsense and businesslike run for the White House and have praised Trump for quietly donated a huge chunk of his fortune to charity and for being a doting dad to his young son.

They have also credited Trump with finally getting Obama to release his long-form birth certificate in 2011. That same year, the Enquirer predicted a Trump presidential run and promoted polls that showed him competitive in a one-on-one race with the president. Meanwhile, their recent reporting on Clinton includes pieces speculating about her weight gain on the campaign trail and allegations that she is terrified of revelations about her secret lesbian lifestyle!

The tabloid has also frequently echoed Trump attack lines on his opponents throughout the campaign and even introduced some tawdrier ones, like alleging that Jeb Bush has an extramarital affair with a Playboy bunny turned lawyer. Last fall, New York magazine reported that Trumps camp was the source behind a salacious Dr. Ben Carson headline (Bungling Surgeon Ben Carson Left Sponge in Patients Brain!) but his campaign vehemently denied it.

David Pecker would be a brilliant choice as CEO of TIME Magazine  nobody could bring it back like David! http://t.co/lLMjQh2iz9  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2013

Meanwhile, the Enquirer  which has a circulation of 371,925  has made a bid for respectability as of late. The tabloid actually broke the story of former presidential candidate John Edwards extramarital affair and illegitimate child with former campaign staffer Rielle Hunter after a months-long investigation, which culminated with the Enquirer reporting on their secret visits to each other. There was even a brief flurry of speculation that the Enquirer might receive the coveted Pulitzer Prize in 2010 for their work, which the San Francisco Examiner likened at the time to nominating a porn flick for an Oscar. The tabloid was nominated in the investigative and national reporting categories, but ultimately missed the cut for finalists.

An unnamed source told The New York Daily News last summer: Trump is a big friend of Pecker ... so no John Edwards-type investigations.

And despite all their efforts to be taken seriously, they havent strayed too far from their formula (and their Enquiring minds want to know catchphrase). Among their more recent articles is a piece alleging that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was murdered by a prostitute.

A significant number of the nations major newspapers have backed Gov. John Kasich for the GOP presidential nomination, but their seal of approval has done little to prop him up in the polls with Republican voters. The latest surveys suggest Kasich is trailing Trump in his home state of Ohio and he has yet to win a 2016 presidential primary. Trump, on the other hand, has seen his unconventional campaign build a formidable lead in delegates and has enjoyed a number of sweeping victories in nearly every region of the country.",[]
msnbc.com,,President Obama calls out America's 'free rider' allies,['Erik Ortiz'],"President Barack Obama is frustrated with Americas allies who turn to the United States for assistance but dont always want to help shoulder the burden  financial or otherwise  of dealing with urgent global threats.

In some of his bluntest comments yet on the subject of foreign policy, Obama told The Atlantic that he warned Great Britain that it would no longer have a special relationship with the U.S. if it did not start spending at least 2 percent of its GDP on defense.

It was previously reported that Obama spoke with Prime Minister David Cameron about Englands military spending during last years G7 summit.

Free riders aggravate me, Obama said in a wide-ranging interview with The Atlantic that was published online Thursday and will be featured in its April issue.

Obama said he has struggled to get other nations to take the lead and pull their weight when necessary on several issues  including terrorism, Russian incursions and Chinese aggression.

The Obama Doctrine by @JeffreyGoldberg https://t.co/dWKRSHlJeF pic.twitter.com/IjuqBwxnzE  The Atlantic (@TheAtlantic) March 10, 2016

Jeffrey Goldberg, who conducted the interview, said the president was especially perturbed when The New Yorker reported, citing an anonymous administration official, that the White House was leading from behind amid the Libya crisis of 2011.

We dont have to always be the ones who are up front, Obama told Goldberg, the magazines national correspondent. Sometimes were going to get what we want precisely because we are sharing in the agenda. The irony is that it was precisely in order to prevent the Europeans and the Arab states from holding our coats while we did all the fighting that we, by design, insisted they lead during the mission to oust longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. It was part of the anti-free rider campaign.

Obama held up Britain and France as examples of nations who seemed resistant to stepping up wholeheartedly at that time.

He said Cameron became distracted by a range of other things, while former French President Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign (in Libya), despite the fact that (the U.S.) had wiped out all the air defenses and essentially set up the entire infrastructure for the intervention.

Obama also questioned Americas relationship with the oil-rich kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has played a pivotal role in the Middle East as a U.S. ally  and Irans archrival.

He said he did not want to throw our traditional allies overboard, but that the Saudis will need to get along with Iran for the sake of extended peace.

The competition between the Saudis and the Iranians  which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in Syria and Iraq and Yemen  requires us to say to our friends as well as to the Iranians that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace, Obama said.

The Atlantic piece also revealed that Obama has likened the entire Middle East to Gotham, the metropolis in the Batman comics, and said ISIS was akin to the Joker from the 2008 movie The Dark Knight, according to advisers.

Theres a scene in the beginning in which the gang leaders of Gotham are meeting, the president has said, according to The Atlantic. These are men who had the city divided up. They were thugs, but there was a kind of order. Everyone had his turf. And then the Joker comes in and lights the whole city on fire. (ISIS) is the Joker. It has the capacity to set the whole region on fire. Thats why we have to fight it.

The president was also introspective of what hes accomplished in his foreign policy efforts so far. He told The Atlantic that he realizes that historians will one day question his decision to not bomb Syria in 2013 after it appeared Damascus had violated his so-called red line against using chemical weapons.

But of that decision, he said, Im very proud of this moment. ... The perception was that my credibility was at stake, that Americas credibility was at stake. And so for me to press the pause button at that moment, I knew, would cost me politically.

msnbc.com,,"Voters learn new details from latest Clinton, Sanders debate",[],"After eight debates between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders  including two since Sunday  its tempting to think there isnt much more voters can learn from these candidates. But as it turns out, last night helped prove that there are still some lessons to be learned.

Towards the end of last nights event in Miami, for example, Univisions Maria Elena Salinas reminded Sanders of comments he made while mayor of Burlington in which he praised Nicaraguas Daniel Ortega and complimented Fidel Castros policies on education, health care, and societal transformation.

The co-moderator said, In South Florida, there are still open wounds among some exiles regarding socialism and communism. So please explain what is the difference between the socialism that you profess and the socialism in Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela. Sanders responded that his comments were intended as criticism of regime-change policies in Latin America.

SALINAS: In retrospect, have you ever regretted the characterizations of Daniel Ortega and Fidel Castro that you made in 1985? SANDERS: The key issue here was whether the United States should go around overthrowing small Latin American countries. I think that that was a mistake... SALINAS: You didnt answer the question.



I suspect for much of the country, this may not have seemed especially significant, but in South Florida, its likely this exchange raised some eyebrows. Sanders controversial attitudes towards figures like Castro and Ortega have gone largely unexplored in the campaign thus far, and its a reminder that even now, voters are still learning relevant details about the candidates past.

Clinton added soon after, in reference to Sanders 1985 comments, I think in that same interview, he praised what he called the revolution of values in Cuba and talked about how people were working for the common good, not for themselves. I just couldnt disagree more. You know, if the values are that you oppress people, you disappear people, you imprison people or even kill people for expressing their opinions, for expressing freedom of speech, that is not the kind of revolution of values that I ever want to see anywhere.

It was a mild preview of the kind of criticisms Sanders would almost certainly face in a general election, if he were to win the Democratic nomination.

Of course, this was just a brief part of a larger event, the bulk of which focused on immigration policy. Both candidates, eager to find an edge with a key constituency in an important state, went surprisingly far in the commitments they were willing to make. MSNBCs report summarized:

Fresh off an upset victory in Michigan the night before, Bernie Sanders sparred with Hillary Clinton on immigration at a debate in Miami Wednesday night, ahead of Floridas primary Tuesday. Facing questions in English and Spanish at the debate, hosted by Univision and The Washington Post, Clinton and Sanders drew a sharp line in the sand on deportation policies, which could haunt them down the road: Both pledged they would not deport children nor undocumented adults without criminal records.

Especially for Clinton, who has gone out of her way to temper her promises to avoid unrealistic goals, last nights commitments came as something of a surprise. Over the course of the debate, Clinton said, as president, she would shield children from deportations; shed limit deportations to undocumented immigrants with criminal records; and shed even try to bring families back together, reuniting immigrant families that have already been separated by previous deportations.",[]
msnbc.com,,GOP mulls unity ticket: 'This makes sense',[],"Conservatives seeking to derail Donald Trump are wondering: What if the contest werent one-on-one  what if it became two-on-one? In other words, what if rivals Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio teamed up and took on Trump together?

Enter the unity ticket: Rubio drops out of the race, and Cruz promises to make Rubio his running mate if Cruz becomes the GOP nominee. The pair then takes on Trump together, pooling supporters, donors, activists, and organizations.

Its an out-there idea in an out-there, unpredictable election that proponents say would offer the establishment GOP a team to rally behind and give Trump a run for his money. Cruz, the argument goes, has earned the favor of the far-right conservative movement, while Rubio has the optimism, energy, and crossover appeal the GOP knows it needs to win a general election.

RELATED: Meet the Republicans speaking out against Trump

For those in the #NeverTrump movement, its hard not to see that in many of the states where Trump has won a plurality in the primaries, Cruz and Rubios votes combined make up a stronger plurality or a definitive majority.

A unity ticket would be something that would be very difficult to overlook, Republican strategist Rick Wilson told MSNBC. Youre filling in a gap in the minds of a lot of conservatives.

Whats more, it might be Rubios last shot at being on the ticket at all.

The Florida senator has set his sights on a big win in his home state, but the string of losses he suffered Tuesday night in Mississippi, Michigan, Idaho and Hawaii have left his campaign on life support. A Quinnipiac poll out Wednesday shows Trump utterly destroying the senator in Florida  a loss that could end his presidential bid and possibly cripple his political career.

The odds of Rubio winning Florida in seven days is not guaranteed. Momentum goes in the direction of winners and Marco Rubio is decidedly not a winner right now, conservative pundit and RedState editor Erick Erickson wrote on Wednesday. But he is awesome. And he will be an awesome former political star with no political future if the present trajectory continues.

Erickson and fellow conservative pundit Glenn Beck, a Cruz surrogate, began championing the idea of a unity ticket last week. This is doable, and this is absolutely unstoppable, Beck declared.

Its an idea that seems likely to please the conservative movement: at CPAC, the rights largest annual confab, last weekend, pollsters emphasized that while just 26 percent of attendees had selected Trump as their first or second choice in the straw poll, 66 percent and 59 percent of the activist attendees selected Cruz and Rubio as their first or second choice, respectively.

While there are rules barring candidates from officially offering cabinet positions to others while running, strategists say they dont see any barrier to two candidates joining together this way, because both will appear on the ballot.

FreedomWorks CEO Adam Brandon is so on board with the idea of a unity ticket that hes asked his organizations lawyers to try and vet the idea to ensure theres no legal barriers to Cruz and Rubio teaming up.

People who support Ted Cruz generally can support Marco Rubio, he told MSNBC on Tuesday. Thats why I keep coming back to it  this makes sense.

The time for such a unity ticket, Brandon said, is right now, before contests in the big winner-take-all-states make Trumps bid completely unstoppable.

If Donald Trump wins like in a state like Ohio or state like Florida, the unity ticket would come up a day too short, Brandon said. If somethings going to happen these folks should probably get together sooner rather than later  preferably before March 15th.

Advocates of a unity ticket argue that Rubio wouldnt be entirely settling: four or eight years as vice president would set him up well to run for president again down the line, just as George H.W. Bush did after losing the 1980 presidential nomination to Ronald Reagan. Bush served as Reagans vice president for eight years, and won the presidency in 1988.

Its that 1980 ticket  a last minute choice at the 1980 convention  that proponents of a unity ticket like to trumpet as proof, because, hey, it worked for Reagan.

Rubio dismissed the idea as kind of House of Cards stuff in an MSNBC town hall on Wednesday.

Im not looking to be anyones vice president, he said.

But Cruz hinted last week he would be open to it.

I think we are seeing discussions within the party about coming together. I think those discussions are happening among the candidates. I think those discussions are happening among the activists. I think those discussions are happening among the donors, he said in Maine.

Former Republican National Committee chair Michael Steele said it was an interesting idea, but unlikely in practice.

Close video Rubio: I'm not interested in being VP At an MSNBC exclusive town hall with Chuck Todd, Marco Rubio declared that he isnt interested in being a VP candidate in 2016. Watch the full town hall on Wednesday at 8pm on MSNBC. embed like save share group

Its ego, its pride, Steele said. Theyd rather go down fighting for the nomination than feeling like they settled. Steele added that there are plenty other qualified conservatives who would make a strong vice presidential choices.

Rick Tyler, Cruzs former communications director turned MSNBC and NBC News political commentator, agreed. Youre dealing with people who want to be president. Its a whole different breed of people, he said.



But a few minutes later, Tyler called back. The idea was sounding more and more intriguing and more common sense the more he thought about it, he said.

I really think theyd be in a strong position, he said. It would also allow the establishment to rally behind Cruz and vice versa with the conservatives who are irritated with Marco.",[]

It also set high expectations on immigration for whomever emerges as the Democratic nominee. Both candidates have vowed to introduce comprehensive immigration reform as a priority, and their promises to not deport broad swaths of the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the country raises the stakes  particularly in the face of a divided government.

Obama faced similar challenges in 2008, when he was a presidential candidate and promised Ramos that he would implement immigration reform in his first term. While the president has since implemented programs to protect 5 million undocumented immigrants from deportations, that interview has since stung him, earning him the label of the deporter in chief after he failed to pass reform.

I do not have the same policy that the current administration does, Clinton said.

Sanders expressed a similar stance, adding that while he aligns with Obama on most things, he is wrong on this issue of deportation, I disagree with him.

But both spent most of the discussion on immigration accusing the other of flip-flopping and pandering to Hispanics on the issue, unloading opposition research about past votes and statements.

Sanders hit Clinton with her infamous bungled answer on drivers licenses for undocumented immigrants in a 2008 Democratic primary, which has continued to haunt her long after she walked it back.

Clinton countered with Sanders vote against a 2007 immigration law backed by the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. Sanders said he voted against the law because it included a guest worker program that many Latino and civil rights group opposed.

Then the senator fired back by bringing up Clintons comments during the 2014 border crisis that Central American children should be sent back. And Clinton returned fire by noting Sanders voted for a bill favored by the Minutemen movement, the vigilantes who patrol the U.S.-Mexico border.

No, I do not support vigilantes and that is a horrific statement, an unfair statement to make, Sanders snapped.

The debate went into the weeds on Senate procedure and while campaign staff flooded reporters inboxes with fact checks and research, both candidates  who have spent decades in public life as feelings on immigration have evolved  emerged with muddied and imperfect records on the issue.

Clinton also faced tough questions about why her private email server, why many Americans dont find her honest, and also Benghazi, which prompted boos from the audience of Democratic voters.

Asked if she would drop out of the race if she were to be indicted for having classified information on her server, she replied curtly: Oh for goodness  that is not going to happen, Im not going to answer that question.

But she also found a way to turn this weakness in a strength by being forthcoming and vulnerable, exposing a bit of herself voters long for in an cycle dominated by a demand for authenticity. This is not easy for me, she said. I am not a natural politician, in case you havent noticed, like my husband or President Obama.

And she once again showcased her ability to connect with voters on an individual level, while Sanders seems most comfortable behind a podium. Please know how brave I think you are, coming here, Clinton told an audience member who said her family had been separated by immigration policies. I want you to know that in the work that Ive done, the families Ive met, Ive heard similar stories.

Naturally, Donald Trump and his comments about immigrants loomed large in the debate, with both candidates competing to trash him harder.

Clinton stopped short, however, of calling the Republican front-runner a racist. Instead, she mocked his plan to build a border wall with Mexico and make that country pay for it. It will be the most beautiful, tall wall, better than the Great Wall of China, she said impersonating the billionaire.

Sanders went further in responding to the question, saying Trump has resorted to racism and xenophobia and bigotry.

Meanwhile, Sanders earned boos from the South Florida audience when a clip was played of the then-mayor of Burlington seemingly defending Fidel Castro by noting the dictator provided a generous social safety net for citizens. Pressed by moderators, Sanders did not disavow his earlier comments.

What that was about was saying that the United States was wrong to try to invade Cuba, that the United States was wrong trying to support people to overthrow the Nicaraguan government, that the United States was wrong trying to overthrow in 1954 the democratically elected government of Guatemala, he said.",[]
msnbc.com,,President Obama calls out America's 'free rider' allies,['Erik Ortiz'],"President Barack Obama is frustrated with Americas allies who turn to the United States for assistance but dont always want to help shoulder the burden  financial or otherwise  of dealing with urgent global threats.

In some of his bluntest comments yet on the subject of foreign policy, Obama told The Atlantic that he warned Great Britain that it would no longer have a special relationship with the U.S. if it did not start spending at least 2 percent of its GDP on defense.

It was previously reported that Obama spoke with Prime Minister David Cameron about Englands military spending during last years G7 summit.

Free riders aggravate me, Obama said in a wide-ranging interview with The Atlantic that was published online Thursday and will be featured in its April issue.

Obama said he has struggled to get other nations to take the lead and pull their weight when necessary on several issues  including terrorism, Russian incursions and Chinese aggression.

The Obama Doctrine by @JeffreyGoldberg https://t.co/dWKRSHlJeF pic.twitter.com/IjuqBwxnzE  The Atlantic (@TheAtlantic) March 10, 2016

Jeffrey Goldberg, who conducted the interview, said the president was especially perturbed when The New Yorker reported, citing an anonymous administration official, that the White House was leading from behind amid the Libya crisis of 2011.

We dont have to always be the ones who are up front, Obama told Goldberg, the magazines national correspondent. Sometimes were going to get what we want precisely because we are sharing in the agenda. The irony is that it was precisely in order to prevent the Europeans and the Arab states from holding our coats while we did all the fighting that we, by design, insisted they lead during the mission to oust longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. It was part of the anti-free rider campaign.

Obama held up Britain and France as examples of nations who seemed resistant to stepping up wholeheartedly at that time.

He said Cameron became distracted by a range of other things, while former French President Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign (in Libya), despite the fact that (the U.S.) had wiped out all the air defenses and essentially set up the entire infrastructure for the intervention.

Obama also questioned Americas relationship with the oil-rich kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which has played a pivotal role in the Middle East as a U.S. ally  and Irans archrival.

He said he did not want to throw our traditional allies overboard, but that the Saudis will need to get along with Iran for the sake of extended peace.

The competition between the Saudis and the Iranians  which has helped to feed proxy wars and chaos in Syria and Iraq and Yemen  requires us to say to our friends as well as to the Iranians that they need to find an effective way to share the neighborhood and institute some sort of cold peace, Obama said.

The Atlantic piece also revealed that Obama has likened the entire Middle East to Gotham, the metropolis in the Batman comics, and said ISIS was akin to the Joker from the 2008 movie The Dark Knight, according to advisers.

Theres a scene in the beginning in which the gang leaders of Gotham are meeting, the president has said, according to The Atlantic. These are men who had the city divided up. They were thugs, but there was a kind of order. Everyone had his turf. And then the Joker comes in and lights the whole city on fire. (ISIS) is the Joker. It has the capacity to set the whole region on fire. Thats why we have to fight it.

The president was also introspective of what hes accomplished in his foreign policy efforts so far. He told The Atlantic that he realizes that historians will one day question his decision to not bomb Syria in 2013 after it appeared Damascus had violated his so-called red line against using chemical weapons.

But of that decision, he said, Im very proud of this moment. ... The perception was that my credibility was at stake, that Americas credibility was at stake. And so for me to press the pause button at that moment, I knew, would cost me politically.

msnbc.com,,Donald Trump lands endorsement of The National Enquirer,[],"Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has been leading in the polls for months, but hes just received his first endorsement from a major publication  the infamous tabloid The National Enquirer.

In this stranger-than-fiction presidential race, Trump has been championed by a publication that has recently purported to out a number of celebrities, discovered unsubstantiated cheating scandals, prematurely predicted the imminent deaths of Hillary Clinton, Angelina Jolie, Cher and Oprah Winfrey (just to name a few), claimed repeatedly that President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were on the brink of divorce, that the Obama daughters were embroiled in a cocaine scandal, and accused comedian Bill Cosby of plotting the murder of his own son.

Trump Must Be President, blasts a headline from within the Enquirers pages, which includes a list of reasons why the real the estate mogul should be elected, including: He will chase down illegal immigrants and toss out the criminals who came streaming through our open borders. That particular statement is ironic, considering the fact that the Enquirer recently published a racially insensitive article about one of its reporters dressing as a terrorist and crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, in their estimation damning evidence of how porous it is.

RELATED: Donald Trump attacks Muslims: Islam hates us

This appears to be the first time The National Enquirer has ever endorsed a candidate for president. MSNBC reached out to the tabloids parent company for comment about why the Enquirer decided to take the plunge with this years contest but has not heard back at this time.

According to The Daily Beast, the Enquirers endorsement of Trump is not surprising considering the friendly relationship he and their owner David Pecker enjoy. Trump has repeatedly sung Peckers praises on social media and has even penned self-congratulatory op-eds for the tabloid, including a three-part series under the banner The Man Behind the Legend! The Enquirer has gushed over the man who has energized millions of voters with his no-nonsense and businesslike run for the White House and have praised Trump for quietly donated a huge chunk of his fortune to charity and for being a doting dad to his young son.

They have also credited Trump with finally getting Obama to release his long-form birth certificate in 2011. That same year, the Enquirer predicted a Trump presidential run and promoted polls that showed him competitive in a one-on-one race with the president. Meanwhile, their recent reporting on Clinton includes pieces speculating about her weight gain on the campaign trail and allegations that she is terrified of revelations about her secret lesbian lifestyle!

The tabloid has also frequently echoed Trump attack lines on his opponents throughout the campaign and even introduced some tawdrier ones, like alleging that Jeb Bush has an extramarital affair with a Playboy bunny turned lawyer. Last fall, New York magazine reported that Trumps camp was the source behind a salacious Dr. Ben Carson headline (Bungling Surgeon Ben Carson Left Sponge in Patients Brain!) but his campaign vehemently denied it.

David Pecker would be a brilliant choice as CEO of TIME Magazine  nobody could bring it back like David! http://t.co/lLMjQh2iz9  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2013

Meanwhile, the Enquirer  which has a circulation of 371,925  has made a bid for respectability as of late. The tabloid actually broke the story of former presidential candidate John Edwards extramarital affair and illegitimate child with former campaign staffer Rielle Hunter after a months-long investigation, which culminated with the Enquirer reporting on their secret visits to each other. There was even a brief flurry of speculation that the Enquirer might receive the coveted Pulitzer Prize in 2010 for their work, which the San Francisco Examiner likened at the time to nominating a porn flick for an Oscar. The tabloid was nominated in the investigative and national reporting categories, but ultimately missed the cut for finalists.

An unnamed source told The New York Daily News last summer: Trump is a big friend of Pecker ... so no John Edwards-type investigations.

And despite all their efforts to be taken seriously, they havent strayed too far from their formula (and their Enquiring minds want to know catchphrase). Among their more recent articles is a piece alleging that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was murdered by a prostitute.

A significant number of the nations major newspapers have backed Gov. John Kasich for the GOP presidential nomination, but their seal of approval has done little to prop him up in the polls with Republican voters. The latest surveys suggest Kasich is trailing Trump in his home state of Ohio and he has yet to win a 2016 presidential primary. Trump, on the other hand, has seen his unconventional campaign build a formidable lead in delegates and has enjoyed a number of sweeping victories in nearly every region of the country.",[]

msnbc.com,,Republicans see political upside to Supreme Court blockade,[],"Senate Republicans have launched a Supreme Court blockade unlike anything Americans have ever seen. Nearly every GOP senator has linked arms and vowed not to consider any high court nominee, regardless of qualifications or merit, until 2017, no matter the consequences.

From practically every angle, its a dangerous, borderline scandalous, gambit that represents a new chapter in Republican radicalism, but Politico reports that some party leaders believe the unprecedented tactics will be politically beneficial for the GOP.

Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas), according to GOP sources, is quietly circulating a four-page memo throughout the Senate Republican Conference on the publics views on filling the high courts vacancy. The memo, obtained by POLITICO, makes the case that a majority of voters would prefer to keep deceased Justice Antonin Scalias seat empty  for a year or even longer  rather than allow Obama to nominate a liberal justice that would move the court to the left.

Though the entire polling memo does not appear to be publicly available, the document Cornyn is distributing to his members show that 54% of respondents were more concerned about a liberal justice being chosen to replace Scalia, while nearly 41% were more worried about the seat being open for a year or more.

Its certainly possible that Senate Republicans, perhaps looking for evidence that tells them what they want to hear, will be delighted to see these results. But there are two considerations for the GOP to keep in mind.

The first is that the survey Cornyn is excited about is only one poll, and theres quite a bit of evidence pointing in a contrary direction. The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found most Americans disapprove of the Republican strategy. The latest Washington Post/ABC News poll agreed, as did Public Policy Pollings findings . A Fox News poll found that 62% of Americans expect policymakers to fill the Supreme Court vacancy this year, not next.

In other words, if Republican senators want to know if the American mainstream is on board with their obstructionist tactics, they can cling to a memo from a partisan pollster, or they can consider the results from several independent surveys.

Of course, there may be some Republican senators who say polling is irrelevant, no matter what it says. Their opposition to President Obama is so extreme, theyll remain focused on blocking the confirmation process whether its popular or not.

But for GOP senators who are worried about their re-election prospects, the risks are real. The Washington Posts Greg Sargent reported yesterday that the Democratic-affiliated Senate Majority PAC is launching a new ad in New Hampshire, which tells viewers, Donald Trump wants the Senate to delay filling the Supreme Court vacancy so he can choose the nominee next year. And Senator Kelly Ayotte is right there to help. Ayotte joined Trump and party bosses in refusing to consider any nominee.

But even among the rosiest of scenarios for both, its possible - if not likely - that they wont reach their magic numbers to clinch their nominations until the final primaries on June 7.

Donald Trump currently has a 95-delegate lead over his closest competitor Ted Cruz, 459-364, according to NBCs count. If he wins both Florida and Ohio next week (and wins the other delegates at the percentage hes currently getting), he will stand at 721 delegates - 516 short of the magic 1,237 number to clinch the nomination.

So to reach 1,237 delegates before June 7 - when California and four other states hold their primaries - Trump would need to win about 80 percent of the delegates up for grabs between March 16-May 24. And thats unlikely to happen, even under the best circumstances for Trump if he continues to have an opponent (say Cruz and/or John Kasich).

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by more than 600 delegates (when you include superdelegates), 1,194 to 569. That is 1,189 delegates short of the 2,383 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination.

For Clinton to reach 2,383 before June, she would need to win 58 percent of the remaining pledged delegates - her current pledged percentage against Sanders - between now and May 17 (a total of 1,930 pledged delegates), as well as add to her superdelegate lead (with 200-plus undeclared superdelegates remaining).

So clinching the nomination by May is doable for Clinton, but not if Sanders starts pulling off more surprises like his Michigan victory on Tuesday. If Clinton and Sanders split the remaining 1,930 pledged delegates 50-50, as well as the undecided superdelegates, Clinton wont hit 2,383 until June.

Thousands of documents apparently leaked from inside ISIS paint a detailed picture of the terror groups personnel, including a 20-year-old from Minneapolis with just a high-school education.

NBC News was among several media organizations to obtain a trove of recruitment forms from a man who claims to be a disillusioned ISIS fighter who recently defected.

The questions start off mundane  name, nickname, date of birth, education  and then shift to the more sinister.

Fields ask about previous fighting experience, blood type, special skills, level of obedience and whether the applicant is interested in fighting or becoming a suicide attacker.

The forms also ask for countries traveled to clarify the route to ISIS caliphate and who can vouch for the recruit.

More than 22,000 jihadis are named in the files and some 51 nationalities represented, according to Britains Sky News. The broadcaster  which also obtained and reviewed the documents  said many of the names were already well-known jihadis, such Londoner Abdel Bary. Other forms bore the names of jihadis known to have died on the battlefield, like former ISIS media-wing head Junaid Hussain.

German intelligence officials are reviewing the files, according to local media there.

Federal police believe that the documents are authentic, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said in an emailed statement noting the potential intelligence value of the trove.

They provide a great chance for the procedure of furnishing proof and the participation also of Germans in terror activities, he said. With this, we also better understand the structures of this terror organization and it will possibly function as a deterrent for some young radical people.

The cache could offer critical information to intelligence agencies  from routes taken by foreign fighters to previously-unknown recruits and recruiters.

The leak and its origin deal a blow ISIS itself, too, signalling weakness at a time when the organization has been coming under increasing pressure.

msnbc.com,,Ohio loves John Kasich. Maybe too much to lose him,['Leigh Ann Caldwell'],"CLEVELAND, Ohio  Ohio Gov. John Kasich is one of the most popular governors in the country, a distinction that could actually harm his quest for the presidency as the campaign barrels into his home state ahead of the next set of critical primary contests.

Its a parochial issue for Ohioans. Many of his supporters want to propel him to the White House, but if he loses the nomination, they wont lose him as their top executive. He will return to Columbus to continue leading the state that hes governed since 2010.

At a recent Kasich rally in Cleveland, a smiling Claude Booker said a loss for Kasich wont necessarily be a loss for his supporters.

We always have Kasich in Ohio, Booker said.

The mutual affinity between Kasich and his constituents in Ohio was on display Tuesday. After months of campaigning outside the state, Kasich returned home to Ohio on Tuesday evening, even as polls were still open in nearby Michigan.

It was obvious that he was glad to be back on home turf. Walking on stage to a standing ovation, he kneeled down and kissed the ground.

Its so nice to be here with all of you in Cleveland, right in Cleveland, Ohio, the beloved city, Kasich said to an overflow crowd in Broadview Heights, a Cleveland suburb.

I have felt the entire time - I hope Im right - that youve been proud of me, proud for me to carry the Buckeye banner, he said as if he was a meandering teenager proving his worth to understanding parents.

Kasichs supporters, even in the Democratic stronghold of Cuyahoga County where Cleveland is located, gushed with affection in return.

Irene Mahlay, a math professor at Cuyahoga County Community College, was also at Kasichs rally and supports him not only because she likes him as governor but because she said his plans for the country are the only ones that add up.

Hes the most reasonable of the candidates, she said, adding that he can answer the following questions: How are you going to balance the budget? How are you gong to compromise? What are you going to do? And the fact that he has a proven record.

Kasich is a popular governor. He was re-elected in 2014, beating his Democratic challenger by more than 30 points. He won all but two of Ohios 88 counties. And even though hes spending much of his time outside of the state running for president, his approval ratings havent seemed to suffer. His constituents gave him the highest level of support of his tenure in October, with 62 percent approving of his job as governor.

Despite his popularity, its no guarantee that hell win here.

The most optimistic poll on the Republican race in Ohio was released on Wednesday by Fox News, showing Kasich beating the rest of the field but with only 34 percent support - far less than his approval rating as governor.

But elections are about choices. And given the choice, 29 percent in that Fox News poll say they support front-runner Donald Trump.

After his surprising second place finish in New Hampshire, Kasich worked to make sure he could stay in the race until Ohio, chugging through a series of primaries less friendly to a Midwestern governor who expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, believes in man-made climate change and avoids slinging mud at front-runner Donald Trump or any of the other two remaining candidates.

Kasich has enjoyed some decent results along the way. He placed second in Massachusetts and nearly won Vermont. He is one of the four remaining candidates in a race that began with 16 Republican contenders. He is the last governor standing.

But Kasich hasnt won a state, yet. And hes only won 54 delegates. If Kasich doesnt do well in Ohio, his chances to be the 45th president are over. (Even winning Ohio makes it difficult for him to win the nomination. It could, however, help him amass enough delegates to further raise the specter of a contested convention if no candidate gets majority support before Republicans meet in Cleveland in July.)

Ohio is a big prize. It awards 66 delegates - five percent of the total needed to reach the nomination and would more than double Kasichs delegate total.

Michael Gordon, a small business owner in Cleveland, said that despite the fact that hes in fourth place, hes going to support Kasich for president because of his policies, his personality, and his morality.

He knows that by helping the business community hes not being a shill. He knows that a good strong private sector generates everything. It generates the roads. It generates the schools, Gordon said. Thats why without getting mushy Im such a big fan of John.

msnbc.com,,Leaked ISIS personnel files paint picture of group's recruits,"['Richard Engel', 'Ben Plesser']","The 23-question form looks like a standard job application  save for the black ISIS logo in the top right corner.

Thousands of documents apparently leaked from inside ISIS paint a detailed picture of the terror groups personnel, including a 20-year-old from Minneapolis with just a high-school education.

NBC News was among several media organizations to obtain a trove of recruitment forms from a man who claims to be a disillusioned ISIS fighter who recently defected.

The questions start off mundane  name, nickname, date of birth, education  and then shift to the more sinister.

Fields ask about previous fighting experience, blood type, special skills, level of obedience and whether the applicant is interested in fighting or becoming a suicide attacker.

The forms also ask for countries traveled to clarify the route to ISIS caliphate and who can vouch for the recruit.

More than 22,000 jihadis are named in the files and some 51 nationalities represented, according to Britains Sky News. The broadcaster  which also obtained and reviewed the documents  said many of the names were already well-known jihadis, such Londoner Abdel Bary. Other forms bore the names of jihadis known to have died on the battlefield, like former ISIS media-wing head Junaid Hussain.

German intelligence officials are reviewing the files, according to local media there.

Federal police believe that the documents are authentic, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said in an emailed statement noting the potential intelligence value of the trove.

They provide a great chance for the procedure of furnishing proof and the participation also of Germans in terror activities, he said. With this, we also better understand the structures of this terror organization and it will possibly function as a deterrent for some young radical people.

The cache could offer critical information to intelligence agencies  from routes taken by foreign fighters to previously-unknown recruits and recruiters.

The leak and its origin deal a blow ISIS itself, too, signalling weakness at a time when the organization has been coming under increasing pressure.

Defense officials in recent weeks captured an ISIS official who has reportedly offered valuable information on the groups chemical weapons and operations while under interrogation.

U.S. airstrikes have been pounding ISIS weapons depots and an airstrike also is believed to have killed a top ISIS commander known as Omar the Chechen in Syria last week.

msnbc.com,,Ohio loves John Kasich. Maybe too much to lose him,['Leigh Ann Caldwell'],"CLEVELAND, Ohio  Ohio Gov. John Kasich is one of the most popular governors in the country, a distinction that could actually harm his quest for the presidency as the campaign barrels into his home state ahead of the next set of critical primary contests.

Its a parochial issue for Ohioans. Many of his supporters want to propel him to the White House, but if he loses the nomination, they wont lose him as their top executive. He will return to Columbus to continue leading the state that hes governed since 2010.

At a recent Kasich rally in Cleveland, a smiling Claude Booker said a loss for Kasich wont necessarily be a loss for his supporters.

We always have Kasich in Ohio, Booker said.

The mutual affinity between Kasich and his constituents in Ohio was on display Tuesday. After months of campaigning outside the state, Kasich returned home to Ohio on Tuesday evening, even as polls were still open in nearby Michigan.

It was obvious that he was glad to be back on home turf. Walking on stage to a standing ovation, he kneeled down and kissed the ground.

Its so nice to be here with all of you in Cleveland, right in Cleveland, Ohio, the beloved city, Kasich said to an overflow crowd in Broadview Heights, a Cleveland suburb.

I have felt the entire time - I hope Im right - that youve been proud of me, proud for me to carry the Buckeye banner, he said as if he was a meandering teenager proving his worth to understanding parents.

Kasichs supporters, even in the Democratic stronghold of Cuyahoga County where Cleveland is located, gushed with affection in return.

Irene Mahlay, a math professor at Cuyahoga County Community College, was also at Kasichs rally and supports him not only because she likes him as governor but because she said his plans for the country are the only ones that add up.

Hes the most reasonable of the candidates, she said, adding that he can answer the following questions: How are you going to balance the budget? How are you gong to compromise? What are you going to do? And the fact that he has a proven record.

Kasich is a popular governor. He was re-elected in 2014, beating his Democratic challenger by more than 30 points. He won all but two of Ohios 88 counties. And even though hes spending much of his time outside of the state running for president, his approval ratings havent seemed to suffer. His constituents gave him the highest level of support of his tenure in October, with 62 percent approving of his job as governor.

Despite his popularity, its no guarantee that hell win here.

The most optimistic poll on the Republican race in Ohio was released on Wednesday by Fox News, showing Kasich beating the rest of the field but with only 34 percent support - far less than his approval rating as governor.

But elections are about choices. And given the choice, 29 percent in that Fox News poll say they support front-runner Donald Trump.

msnbc.com,,Rivals turn their fire on Kasich as the governor gains strength,[],"At various times over the course of the Republican presidential race, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio have faced some pretty harsh criticism from one another. John Kasich, whos finished in fifth place or lower in 10 states thus far, has had the luxury of being largely left alone.

But not anymore. The Ohio governor finished ahead of Rubio in two of this weeks four nominating contests; Kasich has climbed into third place in the latest national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll; and the latest state-based polling suggests Kasich, unlike Rubio, is actually well positioned to win his home state next week.

The Washington Post reports that Team Rubio apparently feels it has no choice but to go into attack mode.

In a clear sign that it views Ohio Gov. John Kasich as a rising threat, a super PAC supporting Sen. Marco Rubios presidential candidacy is launching a major advertising blitz to puncture Kasich in two states holding contests next Tuesday. The group, Conservative Solutions PAC, on Wednesday purchased $1 million in television ad time here in Florida and $268,000 in Illinois for spots opposing Kasich, according to two sources who track media buys.

The commercial, among other things, blasts the governor for embracing Medicaid expansion and bringing health coverage to hundreds of thousands of low-income Ohioans.

Even Trump, probably hoping to knock Kasich out of the race next week, took on the governor at an event yesterday, twice calling Kasich an absentee governor.

To be sure, by 2016 standards, absentee governor is a very mild rebuke, but the point is Trump hasnt felt much of a need to criticize the Ohioan at all.

This isnt completely new. Shortly before the New Hampshire primary, where Kasich finished second, super PACs affiliated with Jeb Bush and Chris Christie also took aim at the governor, with little effect.",[]

msnbc.com,,Four things to watch in the Florida GOP debate,[],"MIAMI  The Republican Partys four remaining candidates are facing off at the University of Miami on Thursday for their last debate before critical races in five states and one territory on March 15.

Of particular importance in Tuesdays races are winner-take-all contests in Ohio and Florida that will go a long way to determining whether frontrunner Donald Trump can put the race away outright or whether his rivals can force a contested convention in July.

With time running out to stop Trump, the debate is another crucial opportunity for the GOP field to make their case.

Here are four things to watch at tonights debate, hosted by CNN, Salem Media Group, and the Washington Times.

Trumps roll to the nomination

Just like the last several debates, the main question will be whether the candidates can slow Trumps momentum. So far the business mogul has been unstoppable; he has continued to win states and expand his delegate lead while facing continuous pressure from his rivals and aggressive fact checks from debate moderators.

RELATED: Rubio sinks as Cruz takes aim

Trumps responses to recent attacks on his business record and positions have been outrageous and astoundingly inconsistent. After last weeks GOP debate, Trump backed down from his boast that he would force Americans to commit war crimes (he says hed change U.S. law first, and then torture people) and the campaign also had to clarify his wild swings between praising high-skilled work visas and promising to crack down on them. Along the way, he appeared to abandon his calls for sweeping government aid to provide health care for the uninsured in favor of a vague plan in line with typical GOP doctrine.

Its hard to know what Trump would do as president based on his public statements. Nonetheless, the results of Saturdays primary contests where Trump easily won Michigan and Mississippi were clear: Republican voters like what they hear. Unless that changes soon, he will become the nominee.

Rubios last stand

Sen. Marco Rubios support crashed through the floor in Saturdays primaries and his campaign looks to be on its last legs. Unless something drastic changes in the next few days, hes unlikely to make it to another debate.

Rubio is banking everything on winning Florida on Tuesday and urging the party to help him do it if only to deny Trump its 99 delegates, but several polls this week show Trump leading by more than 20 points. Even if the Florida senator manages to pull off an upset, a la Bernie Sanders in Michigan, his delegate path to the nomination appears to be closing.

Rubios collapse has coincided with his recent shift to an all-out war on Trump; the senator admitted on Wednesday that some of his more juvenile insults had made him and his family uncomfortable at times. Still, Rubio will be likely to press the attack on issues like the lawsuit-plagued Trump University.

Cracks in the anti-Trump coalition

Sen. Ted Cruz is challenging Rubio in Florida, looking to quickly remove the Florida senator from the race. A pro-Rubio super PAC is running ads against Gov. John Kasich in Florida and Illinois.

RELATED: Anti-Trump forces have few options for third party alternative

With that kind of pressure, there is some motive for the non-Trump candidates to swipe at each other and not just the frontrunner. Since Rubios swing against Trump, the candidates have kept an informal truce, but its a fragile one. Rubio and Cruz have fought in the past over issues like immigration and national security, and its not hard to see how those fissures might erupt now that Rubio is facing the prospect of a humiliating end to his campaign in his own home state.

Kasich next in Trumps warpath?

Trumps bullying often looks unhinged, but theres a kind of predictable ethics to it: If youre nice to him, youll be the last to go. He refrained from targeting Dr. Ben Carson, for example, until Carson started leading polls in Iowa after which Trump compared him to a child molester.

If that pattern holds, Kasich could feel Trumps wrath next. In recent debates, Kasich has tried to stay above the fray and Trump has rewarded the governors passive stance by letting him be. But a Fox News poll on Wednesday showed Kasich leading Ohio and other surveys show him behind but competitive with Trump.

In general, Kasich hasnt been the focus of many negative attacks mainly because hes never looked like a serious threat to win the nomination (he still doesnt). But with Trump, Rubio and Cruz now looking to squeeze every last vote out of the electorate before time runs out, all three of them have incentive to consider turning their attention to him.",[]

They cited uncertainty about the then-principal deputy solicitor generals politics and his previous representation of corporate clients, including former Enron president Jeffrey Skilling and companies accused of human rights abuses.

But if Obama nominates Srinivasan, a former clerk for Justice Sandra Day OConnor whose name is often at the top of reported shortlists, to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, such opposition seems far less likely.

In part, thats because Srinivasans short record on the D.C. Circuit, including upholding the Obama administrations labor protections for home care workers, has assuaged some liberal worries. Privately, progressive legal insiders also say that given that any nominee will be up against fierce Republican opposition to even holding a hearing, organized criticism from the left is unlikely. Whats more, in their minds, anyone who can get confirmed will be better than Scalia.

I dont think youll see a real public criticism, said Caroline Fredrickson, president of the liberal American Constitution Society, referring to the left flank. The stakes are so high. Scalia was so far to the right on almost everything.

In 2013, the human rights group Earth Rights International wrote to senators considering Srinivasans nomination that in private practice, Mr. Srinivasan built a practice around defending powerful multinational companies against allegations of human rights abuses such as war crimes, torture, and summary execution. He has been one of the principal architects of a legal strategy intended to secure special exemptions for corporations from liability for serious abuses.

But more recently, the group has changed its tune. After evaluating Srinivasans record on the D.C. Circuit, weve reconsidered our position, wrote legal director Marco Simons in a blog post after Scalias death. Were not endorsing any candidates for the Supreme Court, but we do not oppose Srinivasans nomination, although we continue to believe the Senate should receive full information about his work as a government lawyer that may have benefited his former corporate clients. Earth Rights also said it had renewed its public records request for documents relating to whether Srinivasan had written memos that would benefit those clients while in the Solicitor Generals office.

The post did not mention any particular D.C. Circuit opinion, and Simons did not reply to requests for comment. But a different legal expert pointed to Srinivasans dissent in a 2015 case, siding with the government over a business group that objected to labeling minerals free of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

A 2013 post on the AFL-CIOs website by the groups head, Richard Trumpka, raised concerns about Srinivasan on the grounds that we need judges who understand the issues that working families face in todays economy. Srinivasans record should be closely examined to get a full picture of his professional background and experience. That post is no longer available on the unions website, and the only mention of Srinivasan that turned up in a search was a post about his opinion upholding minimum wage and overtime protections for home care workers. A spokeswoman said the AFL-CIO would have nothing to add on Srinivasan beyond a statement, issued on February 15, condemning Republicans for refusing to hold a hearing on any nominee.

The Alliance for Justice, a liberal legal group, wrote before Srinivasans nomination that his career left open some questions about his commitment to workers rights and to the rights of everyday Americans facing corporate and banking interests in the federal court.

In an interview, Kyle Barry, director of justice programs at the Alliance for Justice, declined to discuss specific candidates, but said, I think the progressive community broadly is just being supportive of the president doing his constitutional duty of actually nominating someone. And the focus here is whether the Senate will actually do its job and provide a prompt and fair hearing and an up and down vote on whoever that person is.

Thats not to say that any Obama nominee would be rubber-stamped. Even before Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval took himself out of the running after his name was floated by The Washington Post, many progressive groups balked.

CREDOs fierce grassroots activism in support of confirming President Obamas nominee isnt guaranteed, said Murshed Zaheed, acting political director at CREDO, which has gathered nearly 100,000 signatures on a petition asking Obama to nominate a progressive. CREDO is not going to fight to confirm any nominee with a track record of attacking womens rights, workers rights, voting rights, or any other core progressive values.

That said, liberal action on Obamas future nominee is likely going to be firmly focused on vulnerable Republican senators and trying to shame leadership into holding a hearing, despite Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells steadfast opposition.

If we accept that Mitch McConnell can decide how this is going to go  flout precedent, the constitution  none of us are doing our job, said Fredrickson. Hes making a political play. And we have to play our hand too.",[]

Republican Presidential candidate Ted Cruz will pick up his first Senate endorsement today when Sen Mike Lee, a Republican from Utah, will announce hes backing Cruz, sources familiar tell NBC News.

The endorsement comes just days before key contests in Ohio and Florida, and gives the Texas Republican momentum after winning Idaho on Tuesday and receiving the endorsement of former Republican candidate Carly Fiorina on Wednesday.

Lee was one of only three Senators who missed todays Senate vote on a bill to aid those affected by opioid abuse. The other two were Sens Rubio and Cruz.

While Cruz has become a divisive figure within the Republican conference in the Senate, Lee is considered one of his only allies, and at a recent campaign stop Cruz said Lee was someone I love like a brother.

But Lee has not endorsed until today, instead choosing to campaign for Cruz and Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida.

Ive got two really good friends in this race, Lee told reporters at a Cruz campaign stop in South Carolina in February, Any one of them running alone would have gotten my endorsement a long time ago.

The endorsement of Cruz over Rubio before Tuesdays primary in Rubios home state of Florida may be a sign that Republicans see Cruz as the candidate who has the best chance to combat Donald Trump.

Rubios campaign has failed to meet expectations in recent weeks, and the Florida Senator was awarded zero delegates on Tuesday, when four states held contests in the Republican race for the nomination. While Rubio has the backing of 14 Senate Republicans, some of them publicly have express concern that he may need to exit the race if he fails to win Florida next week.

Im not going to give him any strategy or tell him what to do or what not to do, Ill let his people do that, Senator Dean Heller (R-NV), who has endorsed Rubio, told reporters, But I think hes going to have to really rethink moving forward after Florida.

I think he has made the statement before that he needs to carry his state of Florida, and I agree with that, Rubio-backer Sen Jim Inhofe (R-OK) said, But I think most people would anticipate that that would be necessary for him to still be in the race.

msnbc.com,,Spike Lee to revisit #BlackonCampus protests in new documentary,[],"Spike Lees next joint will reportedly revisit the contentious protests on the University of Missouri campus this past fall, which led to a near boycott by the schools football team and the eventual resignation of the schools president.

The events unfolded amid a series of alleged racial incidents on campus  including racial slurs hurled at minorities and the appearance of a swastika drawn in human feces on a campus bathroom wall  that left many black students feeling underwhelmed with the universitys response. Student activists protested for months under the banner of Concerned Student 1950 (the year Mizzou integrated), but their efforts didnt gain real traction until a sizable portion of the schools football team threatened to sit out games. Had the team forfeited their next game, the school stood to lose $1 million.

Then-president Tim Wolfe stepped down (It was the right thing to do, he said), but campus protests continued for several days afterward as activists insisted that their list of demands be met  demonstrations that culminated in one professors infamous call for muscle to help keep reporters out. The protests inspired similar black student-led demonstrations (#BlackOnCampus became a popular hashtag) around the country. Meanwhile, conservatives lashed out at the protests, calling them infantile and disgusting.

Director Spike Lee, who has made acclaimed documentaries about Hurricane Katrina, the 16th Street Baptist church bombing and the careers of Michael Jackson, Jim Brown and Kobe Bryant, plans to aim his lens at the Mizzou movement in a film for ESPN entitled 2 Fists Up.

According to the Columbia Daily Tribune, the film, which will be released digitally on May 31 as part of a new series of 15-to-30 minute mini-docs (or rather, Spike Lees Lil Joints), will be an examination of how the Black Lives Matter movement sparked activism at the University of Missouri, its football team, and across the rest of the United States.

The Do the Right Thing filmmaker reportedly has been on campus conducting interviews with students and recently attended a screening of a 30-minute documentary made about Concerned Student 1950. The director also filmed a recent protest by student activists over the lack of racial progress on campus in the aftermath of Wolfes resignation.

The working group is working and the protest that happened on our campus today is unfair and might leave a wrong impression about the amount of progress we have made and the climate on our campus today, Chuck Henson, interim vice chancellor for inclusion, diversity and equity, said in a statement to the Kansas City Star. We are dealing with issues that took more than 100 years to develop here, and it is certainly going to take more than 100 days and three meetings to address, he said.

We try to reach out, and they shut the door on us all the time, countered Imani Simmons-Elloie, a member of Concerned Student 1950. Its always portrayed that the black kids are crying wolf, but the media was here to see that they close the door on us.

The artist, who appears prominently on fellow Chicago rapper Kanye Wests new album, has called the film  which satirically portrays a sex strike waged to combat gun violence in the city  exploitative, offensive, sexist, and racist. Lee has snapped back , pointing out that Chance the Rappers father works in embattled Mayor Rahm Emanuels administration. Lee has yet to comment publicly on his planned film. Nevertheless, he has been on a topical streak as of late. His last feature film, Chi-raq, explored the gun violence epidemic in the city of Chicago.

But lets not look past the guy the candidates are ready to replace.

The L.A. Times reported today on a development Republicans will probably find deeply discouraging, if not downright baffling.

As if Republicans arent having enough problems, several new polls indicate an additional one  an upswing in the public standing of President Obama. The popularity of the incumbent president often has had a measurable impact on how elections turn out. If Americans have a more favorable image of the current occupant of the Oval Office, theyre more likely to keep his party in power.

Just this afternoon, Gallup daily tracking found Obamas approval rating up to 52% , a three-year high. Last week, Gallups weekly averages also showed the presidents support at its highest level since 2013.

A Washington Post/ABC News poll released earlier this week showed Obamas approval rating up to 51%, which is also a three-year high.

FiveThirtyEights Nate Silver recently joked , Maybe Obama looks a little better in comparison to the unpopular set of candidates theyve been seeing and hearing so much from lately.

Circling back to our coverage from a couple of months ago, Im not unsympathetic to the argument that Obamas approval rating is irrelevant, since he obviously cant seek another term. This might have some effect on historians perspective when the presidents legacy is being debated, but its understandable that much of the political world would be far more interested in the latest poll results out of Ohio and Florida.

But dont be too quick to dismiss the significance of Obamas support. He wont literally be on the ballot, but theres little doubt the presidents standing will have a real impact on the publics appetite  or lack thereof  for radical change in 2017 and beyond.

When Ronald Reagan was elected to the presidency in a landslide victory over Jimmy Carter (for whom Matthews had worked as a speechwriter), Speaker ONeill realized Americans had voted for a change. For the first time in his career, ONeill also found himself thrust into the national spotlight as the highest-ranking leader of the Democratic Partythe most visible and respected challenger to President Reagans agenda of shrinking the government and lowering taxes.

Together, the two leaders fought over the major issues of the daywelfare, taxes, covert military operations, and Social Securitybut found their way to agreements that reformed taxes, saved Social Security, and achieved their common cause of bringing peace to Northern Ireland.

As Matthews notes, There is more than one sort of heroic behavior, and they dont all look the same. Tip and the Gipper is the story of the kind of heroism we need today.

Tip and the Gipper is now available online and in stores.

In the media:

Politico: Chris Matthews draws on his 30-year-old journals for rich new book

Mother Jones: Matthews is telling a political tale, and though he was a front-row participant in the story, he admirably adopts and evenhanded approach...to serve up his big point: Political combat is necessary and important for the nation, but it need not be self-destructive and nuclear.

Chris Matthews in Time: Obama and Boehner can still get something done. Just take a page from Ron and Tip

Publishers Weekly: Part history, part Washington inside story, part career memoir, this inspiring story of two remarkable men is recommended for political junkies and insiders alike.

Chris Matthews in USA Weekend recounts how ONeill and Reagan made politics work for the people.

Michael Smerconish in the Philadelphia Inquirer: Why Matthews has chosen this moment to release a book with stories he lived three decades ago is obvious. As he told me, What were going through right now is not normal American politics.

msnbc.com,,Where Are They Now: Locker Lookz,['Frank Silverstein'],"JoAnn Brewer and Christi Sterling are two moms from Dallas who built a business based on a series of decorations they made by hand for their middle school daughters lockers. When other parents called to ask where they bought them, JoAnn and Christi realized they might have a marketable product. And Locker Lookz was born.

While the idea was easy and fun, the process of taking that idea and turning it into a business was quite difficult.

Your Business chronicled the process that followed, which led the duo from a marketing consultant to a trade show to a manufacturer to a retail buyer. With a contract to purchase based on their homemade craft items, they identified a broker to find a factory in China, produce prototypes, negotiate terms and delivery, and finally find a fulfillment to deliver the final order to the retail stores. Despite a few stumbles and missteps, JoAnn and Christi got through their first year, and Locker Lookz has since taken off.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: TWO YEARS LATER



Its now been two years since we first met JoAnn and Christi, and they are still very much in business. They have since partnered with a wholesale craft supply company, Darice, which allows them focus their efforts in the areas they most enjoy. We are still very involved from a product development and creative standpoint, but without all the heavy lifting, they said in an email to msnbc.

More exciting still, they have added a new line of products for decorating tween-age bedrooms called Room Lookz. The line offers colorful products like pillows, mirrors, lamps, and desk items to appeal middle school-age girls.

In February 2015, JoAnn and Christi attended the annual Toy Fair in New York City, where they introduced their new Room Lookz line alongside the latest items for Locker Lookz.",[]

msnbc.com,,Where Are They Now: Monterey Makeover,['Frank Silverstein'],"In May 2014, we traveled to the famous Fishermans Wharf in Monterey, California to answer two viewers call for help.

JOE & MARY DELECCE

Joe and Mary Delecce have successfully run four separate jewelry shops on the Monterey pier for over 15 years. Their son, who asked not to be named, wrote to us because he was afraid the stores wouldnt be able to support Joe and Marys retirement.

My parents gave everything to give us a leg up in our world and never asked for something in return, the Delecces son said. They are 64 and 65 years old  without a retirement nest egg. With nothing to fall back on, the Delecces needed a new strategy.

ENTER: YOUR BUSINESS SWAT TEAM

Our goal was to transform this business into a rock-solid nest egg for retirement.

First, we reached out to Chris Myers, founder of BodeTree, a Denver-based financial software company. Chris synced up the Delecces accounting system, Quickbooks, with his BodeTree analytics software. With it, he identified the strong and weak areas of the business and helped Joe and Mary create a plan to double their companys valuation to $1.2 million.

Chris passed his financial analysis on to Helen Bulwik, a retail specialist and partner at San Francisco-based Newport Board Group. Helen advises top retailers like Macys and Nordstrom, and she volunteered to help the Delecces.

Helen saw two key problems with this business: The Delecces maintained a very large payroll, as they staffed four separate shops, and they had too much inventory tying up their working capital.

Close video Monterey Makeover: Part Two Take a look at the second part of the Monterey Makeover. embed like save share group

Helen identified that Joe and Marys silver store brought in almost 50 percent of sales, yet took up 70 percent of their inventory. She suggested Joe and Mary cut their inventory in half. One of their biggest rules for buyers at Macys is to reduce assortments, not expand them, Helen explained. [They] identify top-selling items and eliminate everything else.

In order for the Delecces to track which styles were selling fastest, we brought in Dawn Brolin, CPA. Thanks to a donation from the Intuit Reseller Program, Dawn provided the Delecces with a brand new point-of-sale (POS) system that will allow the Delecces to tag every single item in the store and track whats selling out and when.

Helen also surprised the Delecces when she pointed out that their money-saving practice of buying loose pearls and stringing them themselves might actually be a selling point to their customers. She suggested that instead of stringing pearls in the back of the store, the Delecces should make the process visible to customers. Bring it out front to entertain the customers, and it will boost your sales, Helen said, identifying the practice as retail-tainment.

DOWNSIZING  AND UPGRADING

Helen also suggested the Delecces consolidate their four locations. She introduced interior designers Michael Bodziner and Amy Taylor of architecture and design firm Gensler. Michael and Amy drew up plans and suggested a new name for the single store: Monterey Bay Jewelry Company. Their plans called for a special booth out front so the pearl-stringer could be used to attract new customers while demonstrating his craft.

The Gensler plan also called for updated furniture to modernize the look. To offset the cost of the new jewelry cases, Helen arranged for Premier Store Fixtures to provide the custom-made cases at no cost.

To pay for the remainder of the store makeover, the Delecces sold off some of their less popular inventory at a discount  and made nearly $100,000 to reinvest in their store.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: NINE MONTHS LATER

The Delecces are now busy preparing for their grand re-opening, slated for March 2015. They chose one store to expand and act as their sole location going forward. While that is under renovation, they are also cleaning out their other storefronts and preparing them to be leased to new tenants.

The Delecces loved the new name Monterey Bay Jewelry and submitted the plans for the new sign to the city planning commission. They received notice that the new sign was approved and displayed it on their storefront in February.

The new display cases from Premier Store Fixtures arrived, and Joe says they are even more beautiful than they looked in the drawings. The Delecces have begun to integrate the inventory from the four sites, and that means weeding through thousands of items. Once everything has been cataloged into the new POS system, they will be able to track sales and focus on increasing turnover.

Its something weve been dreaming about, talking about  and now youve brought it to fulfillment, Mary said. So its really hard to say a simple thank you!",[]

In 2015, SoapBox Soaps is adding major retail partners like CVS and Sams Club, and expanding existing relationships with Target and Whole Foods. SoapBoxs new line of hand and body lotions will be sold in over 1,600 CVS stores; three kinds of SoapBox lotions are already on sale there. By mid-March, SoapBoxs new selection of hair care products  including eight shampoos and conditioners  will be on shelves at every Target location. Sams Club is giving SoapBox a 16-week trial run in more than 600 locations around the country beginning the second week of April. Theyll be selling a three-pack of the companys new liquid hand soaps. Whole Foods has also expanded SoapBoxs reach, as the grocer will now distribute Soapbox products in nine regions. And to top it all off, 1,500 additional grocery stores on the East Coast have started selling SoapBox products.

At SoapBox headquarters in Alexandria, Va., three staff members have joined the team: a director of communications, a director of operations, and a director of national accounts. Last year, the company set new records for their charitable giving. Thanks to the sales of bar soap, liquid hand soap, and body wash, SoapBox donated almost 180,000 bars of soap.",[]

msnbc.com,,Where Are They Now: Hangover Heaven,['Jessica Shim'],"For most, a hangover is the consequence of one too many drinks. But for Dr. Jason Burke, it was the start of a new business.

In March 2013, Your Business traveled to the Sin City to talk shop with Dr. Jason Burke, founder and CEO of Hangover Heaven. The company uses IV hydration, vitamins, and other medications to treat patients suffering from hangover symptoms. Dr. Burke, a board-certified anesthesiologist with a medical degree from the University of North Carolina, says he can treat almost 95 percent of all hangover symptoms in about 45 minutes.

In an effort to make its services as convenient and readily available as possible, the company turned an old gospel tour bus into a mobile treatment facility. Hangover Heaven also provides shuttle service to their clinic, and offers in-room treatment options.

But that doesnt mean the business has been welcomed with open arms. Some question whether or not a hangover is a medical condition that needs to be treated. To tackle that hurdle, Dr. Burke created the Hangover Research Institute to gather scientific evidence to back his claims and regularly asks clients to post on social media about their experiences.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: TWO YEARS LATER

According to Hangover Heaven, the company saw a 40-percent increase in 2014 revenue year over year, and expects revenue to grow in 2015 as well. Hangover Heaven has found the greatest growth in private, in-hotel-room treatment plans, thanks to the relationships it has forged with concierge services at major hotels on the Strip. Dr. Burke says his company is often called to VIP rooms to provide treatment, and recalls one instance when, after providing treatment for a VIP client, the client felt so much better that he extended his trip to Vegas an extra day.

Hangover Heaven has also expanded its clinic to make room for a designated space for the Hangover Research Institute. It continues to conduct research on hangovers and ways to treat the symptoms head on.

Dr. Burke continues to receive requests to expand his business into other cities across the globe, and is seriously considering expanding the company into other locales.",[]
msnbc.com,,Hip-hop legend Method Man on Ferguson and police tensions,[],"Close video Hip-hop legend Method Man on Ferguson Hip-hop legend and member of the iconic group Wu-Tang clan, Method Man talks to Tamron Hall about the situation in Ferguson and more. embed like save share group

Hip-hop legend and Wu-Tang clan member, Method Man made headlines when he spoke out during the aftermath of Eric Garners death in his hometown of Staten Island, New York. Now, hes speaking out about the ongoing unrest and police tensions in Ferguson, Missouri following the resignation of Police Chief Thomas Jackson and the shooting of two police officers during a rally early Thursday morning.

During his conversation with Tamron Hall, Method Man talks about the officer involved death of his friend Ernest Sayon and recalls his own encounters with police growing up saying, being a youth in the hood, I would be harassed. Illegal searches - the works. But he also acknowledges that there are great cops out there that go above and beyond the call of duty.

Although relations between communities and those in authority have improved throughout the years, there is still an adversarial relationship between some police officers and some in minority communities - black and brown specifically. Method Man says a lot of that has to do with the communication barriers, and suggests that there should be some type of forum for both sides to speak to each other, so there can be some type of understanding.

Its all about fear... An [officer] is still a human being and when that fear kicks in, you never know what can happen.  Method Man

At the end of the day, why are relationships with the police so strained and why are tensions so high? Method Man suggests that its all about fear on both sides. The community he said are afraid of the police, what they can do and the power that theyve willed. On the other hand, police officers are just as frightened as [we are], but [have] guns. He points out however, that when it comes down to human nature, we must keep in mind an officer is still a human being and when that fear kicks in, you never know what can happen.

The recent events in Ferguson compelled Method Man to share his thoughts on police tensions, but he was originally scheduled to talk with Tamron Hall about his new movie, The Cobbler with Adam Sandler. The comedy follows the life of a New York shoe repair man who stumbles upon a magical heirloom that allows him to step into the lives of his customers and see the world in a new way. The Cobbler hits theaters and video on demand Friday, March 13th. Check out the trailer here.",[]
msnbc.com,,One-on-one with Joe Giudice of 'Real Housewives of New Jersey',[],"I was to blame said Real Housewives of New Jersey reality star Joe Giudice during his one-on-one interview with Tamron Hall on the Today Show when asked if his wife Teresa took a fall for his actions. Last year, a federal judge issued prison sentences to the couple, who are parents to four daughters, after they plead guilty to fraud charges.

I took full responsibility for everything, but they still put her away. I mean, I was supposed to go away, not her. And that was part of the plea. What I thought, anyway. I dont know what happened in the courtroom that day, Joe went on to say about the incarceration of his wife. Teresa is slated to be released December 23rd, and Joe is scheduled to begin serving 41 months of jail time at the end of March.

Joe said the illegal activity, which he and his wife pleaded guilty, happened before the reality TV series premiered. When asked if it was worth it, he replied, No, of course its not worth it. Im not saying I didnt do anything wrong or illegal, but there was definitely people behind [the scenes] talkin to [law enforcement officials] and telling em we did this and telling em we did that to bring it to their attention. And, you know, being in the public eye didnt help.

msnbc.com,,What Capitol Hill really thinks about Donald Trump and the election,[],"For a congressional staffer, social media can be the devil. So when there is activity on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram (lets not get into Snapchat), youll typically find cautiously-worded posts and politically correct photos.

But these humans, like most humans, have opinions and judgments, and on occasion their views might differ from those of their bosses or peers. With Cloakroom, theres no repercussion for being honest  because its anonymous.

Staffers on Capitol Hill have been using this app to express unfiltered thoughts on life, policy and events ever since it launched last year. Now, as the 2016 presidential race has become a political focal point, the election is a common theme among its 2,800 active users.

All thats required for entry is a senate.gov or house.gov email address. Once approved, a user can create an alias and start posting. Other users can then upvote a post or reply with a comment.

MSNBC was given a 24-hour access pass into the app to see exactly what was being shared on the Hill as it related to the election. Users from both parties, unsurprisingly, had a lot of nice and not-so-nice things to say about front-runners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

Sometimes I feel like Trump has pulled a massive Borat/Andy Kaufman on America and Im the only one in on the joke, one user wrote.

Another posted: The Rs might be freaking out. They are losing their party to a candidate that is half fascist and half populist. I dont know many informed Democrats that are worried. Look at the poll earlier. Cant wait to run against the Donald. A Republican staffer replied, Im not. This has been the dark side of the Republican party for 8 years...

I sound like a broken record, but Trump is killing it, one user wrote, to a rapid response: Whats he killing? Civil discourse?

Cloakroom was created by Ted Henderson, a former Capitol Hill intern who was once told by a former chief of staff that, your job is to support your boss, not really to be seen or heard personally. In an effort to provide an open forum without staining reputations, Henderson leveraged his outreach with Capitol Bells, another app he created which offers alerts on updates from the House and Senate and which hundreds of staffers use.

People are using social media, Henderson told MSNBC, but by giving them anonymity, they can be as honest as they want to be. The app doesnt collect information; there is nothing personal saved on the server in case it gets hacked, Henderson said.



On Cloakroom, people who typically feel strong allegiance to their party share concerns and even pose questions to one another across the aisle.

Any Republicans here who are willing to vote for Hillary over either Trump or Cruz? asked Spending289. One response was a flat-out no, while another wrote, I doubt any of the people that have said they would or might would actually go through with it.



Posed to Democratic staffers, one user asked: Would you rather face Trump (yea) or Cruz (nay)? Someone under the username wholistic.thinker responded: Either one, The dem candidate, whom ever it is, will win. Do you republicans honestly think candidates can lead the free world....

Hillary Clintons private email server is also a topic bouncing around in the app, as is who the former secretary of state should choose as her running mate. (Julian Castro, Gabrielle Giffords and Tulsi Gabbard were some names thrown out.)

When former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg officially said he wouldnt put his hat in the 2016 ring, Cloakroom users shared their feelings on that, too. Youre surprised Bloomberg isnt running? one wrote. Another said, Im a bit bummed.

John Kasich thinks he is with Harry Potter, but he would obviously be in Hufflepuff, and that Ted Cruz would try to shut down the Ghostbusters.

A new feature recently added to the app is direct messaging between users. Much like Snapchat, once a message is read, its instantly deleted.

msnbc.com,,Senate Republicans debunk their own Supreme Court talking points,[],"Senate Republicans have had about a month to come up with a coherent rationale for imposing a blockade on any Supreme Court nominee from President Obama. The fact that theyve failed so spectacularly to think of anything sound is probably a bad sign.

But the fact that theyre starting to debunk their own talking points is far worse.

A couple of weeks ago, for example, a wide variety of Republicans repeated this line about the merits of a partisan blockade: This is a tradition that both parties have lived by for over 80 years where in the last year, if there was a vacancy in the last year of a lame duck president, you dont move forward.

Today, another Republican senator  who actually supports his partys strategy  acknowledged that his partys argument was a lie. The Huffington Post noted

One of the Republican Partys most candid senators, Lindsey Graham (S.C.), admitted Thursday a stark fact that the rest of his colleagues have tried their best to avoid: that their blockade of any Supreme Court nominee by President Barack Obama is unprecedented. And he insisted that he was going to go along with it, even though he predicted it would worsen relations between the parties and the functioning of the Senate.

Graham conceded , We are setting a precedent here today, even after weeks of GOP rhetoric about how theyre already following an existing precedent. The South Carolina Republican added that his partys current gambit would establish a new rule  effectively admitting that such a rule is not currently in place.

The comments were held during a Judiciary Committee discussion about why the Judiciary Committee will refuse to have discussion about the Supreme Court nomination that does not currently exist.

Grahams unexpected concession made his partys arguments look both indefensible and dishonest, but Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) went even further in discrediting his own partys claims. TPM reported

During a Thursday morning radio interview, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) candidly explained that Senate Republicans would take a different approach to a Supreme Court nominee if a Republican president were in office and replacing a conservative justice. Johnson was asked on Wisconsin radio show Morning Mess about Senate Republicans refusal to consider President Obamas forthcoming nomination to the Supreme Court. The host hypothesized that things would be different if Mitt Romney were in the White House.

The far-right Wisconsin senator, up for re-election this year, said it would be different if a Republican president were currently in office. As Johnson put it, Generally, and this is the way it works out politically, if youre replacing  if a conservative presidents replacing a conservative justice, theres a little more accommodation to it.

He added, But when youre talking about a conservative justice now being replaced by a liberal president who would literally flip the court  you know, lets face it, I dont think anybodys under any illusion  President Obamas nominee would flip the court from a 5-4 conservative to a 5-4 liberal controlled court.... And so its an incredibly serious moment in terms of whats the composition of the court going to be.

In other words, as far as Johnsons concerned, pleasant-sounding rhetoric about principles and Senate norms and traditions is all just window dressing. President Obama is a Democrat, and since Antonin Scalia was a conservative, Ron Johnson believes the constitutional process should be ignored for the most brazenly partisan reasons.

And now a prominent Senate Republican is admitting publicly that the partys professed principles are irrelevant and the party would be acting differently if the president werent a Democrat.",[]

msnbc.com,,Appeals court: North Carolina can print 'Choose Life' plates,['Associated Press'],"RALEIGH, N.C.  North Carolina can issue specialty vehicle license plates with anti-abortion slogans while refusing to also produce tags that offer pro-abortion rights views, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday.

In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals said North Carolina can issue license plates bearing the statement Choose Life. The General Assembly in 2011 passed legislation allowing the anti-abortion expression while rejecting requests to also issue tags saying Respect Choice or similar abortion-rights phrases.

The same appeals court two years ago had said the General Assemblys actions discriminated against differing viewpoints and was unconstitutional. That was before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a Texas case last year that specialty license plates represented government speech, allowing Texas to reject a proposal for tags featuring a Confederate battle flag.

The Supreme Court ordered the Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court to reconsider the North Carolina case in light of its decision on the Texas tags.

We now conclude that specialty license plates issued under North Carolinas program amount to government speech and that North Carolina is therefore free to reject license plate designs that convey messages with which it disagrees, Chief Judge William Traxler wrote in the appeals courts majority decision.

North Carolina native and appeals court Judge James Wynn dissented, saying the other two judges were misreading the implications of the Supreme Courts Texas case. He said expressions on license plates arent purely the governments expression of messages it approves. Legislators themselves recognized that the tags were intended to be a forum for private expression by the people who buy them.

A person who sees a North Carolina Id Rather Be Shaggin  specialty plate during Monday morning rush hour surely does not routinely and reasonably believe that such a plate embodies the State of North Carolinas credo, Wynn wrote. Nor is it likely that a North Carolina Libertarian who applies for a Dont Tread On Me specialty plate is motivated by a desire to convey to the public the governments seal of approval.

The Supreme Courts decision must have recognized that allowing officials alone to determine government speech would allow it to discriminate against disfavored speakers and messages at will, Wynn wrote. Its implausible that the Supreme Court meant to force us to choose that the mule in this case is either a horse or a donkey.

The legal fight has blocked the state Division of Motor Vehicles from producing the Choose Life tags.

The American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina, which sued to block the Choose Life plates, issued a statement urging the General Assembly to allow pro-abortion rights supporters to also express themselves.

msnbc.com,,Tales from the trail: Another reason for Rubio to dislike Ohio State football,['Alexandra Jaffe'],"Want to know what the NBC News Embeds saw? Follow their daily journey to the inside of the 2016 presidential campaign here:

Another Reason for Rubio to Dislike Ohio State Football

COLUMBUS, Ohio - Marco Rubio now has another reason to dislike Ohio State football.

Urban Meyer, the teams popular coach, endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Thursday.

Go win this thing, Meyer told Kasich in a video released by the campaign Thursday morning.

Meyer left Rubios beloved Florida Gators after the 2010 college football season and was hired by the Buckeyes in 2011. The team won a national championship in 2015.

Meyer won two national championships in Florida, and Rubio has said there is no ill will for the coachs decision to leave Gainesville.

According to a recent poll from PPP, 85 percent of Ohio State football fans approve of the job Meyer is doing. Thats even higher than the high approval rating Kasich clocked in with Ohioans in October at 62 percent.

The news comes just two days after voters in Ohio States rival territory Michigan went to the polls. Kasich proudly brings up his time as a student at Ohio State at nearly every one of his town halls, but he also poked fun at the rivalry on his recent campaign swing through the state to Ohios north. I talked Urban Meyer into laying low just so Michigan could beat us this year, he would joke to Michigan crowds.

MSNBC scheduled a quick check-in with the embeds for the afternoon at 2:50. They wanted to hear from Vaughn, myself and Danny Freeman about what its like being on the trail, and we all happily obliged, figuring wed easily make the time in our day.

But with a dozen other things going on, Vaughn and I hit the road a little late. When we got to the address of the debate location, where we planned to do our hit, we were 20 minutes early but clearly in the wrong place  a nondescript gray office building on the side of a highway in Coral Gables.

A cop set us on the right way, but we kept running into roadblocks: A slow red sedan in front of us, and then skeptical organizers at the press check-in who pointed us towards our camera location but told us it was a far walk and theyd never let us through without our IDs.

Were on TV! Vaughn shouted at them defiantly, and we set off in a sprint.

Running slightly behind Vaughn, I had the feeling I imagine mountaineers who never make the summit experience.

Were not gonna make it, Vaughn! I gasped. I cant run that fast!

He shouted back, a little frantic: Weve gotta make it, Jaffe!

We ran through the parking lot, across the practice field and smack into a row of cameras. Frantically, we searched for the familiar peacock logo, finding only local NBC affiliates. Where was the camera?!?

A particularly elaborate set-up looked promising, so we asked: Are you guys with NBC?

Network? The producer and camera man replied.

YES!

We made it. Vaughn had to finish buttoning up his shirt and tying his tie. My hair was everywhere after running through a field. We were both a bit red in the face and sweaty from the heat. But we made it.

Within 12 minutes, we were hooked up with mics, dialed in to the control room, speaking live on MSNBC and down.

It was a crazy, big adventure  for a simple little bit of TV.

msnbc.com,,Tales from the trail: Another reason for Rubio to dislike Ohio State football,['Alexandra Jaffe'],"Want to know what the NBC News Embeds saw? Follow their daily journey to the inside of the 2016 presidential campaign here:

Another Reason for Rubio to Dislike Ohio State Football

COLUMBUS, Ohio - Marco Rubio now has another reason to dislike Ohio State football.

Urban Meyer, the teams popular coach, endorsed Ohio Gov. John Kasich on Thursday.

Go win this thing, Meyer told Kasich in a video released by the campaign Thursday morning.

Meyer left Rubios beloved Florida Gators after the 2010 college football season and was hired by the Buckeyes in 2011. The team won a national championship in 2015.

Meyer won two national championships in Florida, and Rubio has said there is no ill will for the coachs decision to leave Gainesville.

According to a recent poll from PPP, 85 percent of Ohio State football fans approve of the job Meyer is doing. Thats even higher than the high approval rating Kasich clocked in with Ohioans in October at 62 percent.

The news comes just two days after voters in Ohio States rival territory Michigan went to the polls. Kasich proudly brings up his time as a student at Ohio State at nearly every one of his town halls, but he also poked fun at the rivalry on his recent campaign swing through the state to Ohios north. I talked Urban Meyer into laying low just so Michigan could beat us this year, he would joke to Michigan crowds.

The trademark the Republican presidential front-runner took on Trump Steaks in August 2006 was canceled eight years later, in December 2014, according to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

The supposed Trump Steaks that the GOP front-runner trotted out Tuesday after notching primary victories in Mississippi and Michigan are actually from Bush Brothers Provisions, a longtime West Palm Beach meat purveyor, according to the company. (Its not connected to Trumps ousted rival Jeb Bush.)

It is not unusual for meat to be purchased wholesale and rebranded, but that did not appear to be the case with the meat presented Tuesday. In fact, some of the meat on the butcher board was still wrapped in Bush Brothers packaging. None of the meat appeared to be in Trump Steaks packaging.

We do supply his properties in Palm Beach County with beef, a company spokesman told NBC News, referring to Trump. Hes a customer.

When asked if Trump was still in the meat business, his spokeswoman, Hope Hicks said in an email: Vast amounts of meat are sold at Trump clubs and properties. Members and other patrons are allowed to purchase the meat- it is a very small, but successful business. The meat is purchased from different locationally [sic] convenient purveyors and is always of the highest quality.

NBC News reached out to Hick via email Thursday specifically asking whether Trump was selling meat sold and packaged as Trump Steaks. She did not immediately return the email or a subsequent phone call.

Trump on Wednesday took issue with CNNs Anderson Cooper for saying Trump Steaks was discontinued because Sharper Image, the original supplier of the meats, doesnt carry them anymore.

No, no, no, Trump insisted. Theyre sold differently, (but) its the same thing. Its an offshoot of it.

Trump brought out the meat during his victory bash Tuesday at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida  several days after Mitt Romney publicly questioned the moguls business savvy and ticked off a list of his failed ventures, including Trump Steaks.

The Manhattan mogul launched his line of frozen steaks in 2007 in partnership with Sharper Image and QVC, promising to deliver a taste of Donald Trumps luxurious lifestyle.

When it comes to great steaks, Ive just raised the stakes! Trump declared in a promotional video released as early as 2007. Trump Steaks are by far the best tasting, most flavorful beef youve ever had. Truly in a league of their own.

The Classic Collection  two filet mignons, two ribeyes and a dozen burgers  were priced at $199.

But while Trump can rightly claim a number of business successes, marketing meat turned out not to be one of them.

The brand aired only in 2007, but it looks like there were some online orders that came through in 2008, QVC spokeswoman Ilana McCabe said in an email. Nothing after that.

msnbc.com,,Appeals court: North Carolina can print 'Choose Life' plates,['Associated Press'],"RALEIGH, N.C.  North Carolina can issue specialty vehicle license plates with anti-abortion slogans while refusing to also produce tags that offer pro-abortion rights views, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday.

In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals said North Carolina can issue license plates bearing the statement Choose Life. The General Assembly in 2011 passed legislation allowing the anti-abortion expression while rejecting requests to also issue tags saying Respect Choice or similar abortion-rights phrases.

The same appeals court two years ago had said the General Assemblys actions discriminated against differing viewpoints and was unconstitutional. That was before the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a Texas case last year that specialty license plates represented government speech, allowing Texas to reject a proposal for tags featuring a Confederate battle flag.

The Supreme Court ordered the Richmond, Virginia-based appeals court to reconsider the North Carolina case in light of its decision on the Texas tags.

We now conclude that specialty license plates issued under North Carolinas program amount to government speech and that North Carolina is therefore free to reject license plate designs that convey messages with which it disagrees, Chief Judge William Traxler wrote in the appeals courts majority decision.

North Carolina native and appeals court Judge James Wynn dissented, saying the other two judges were misreading the implications of the Supreme Courts Texas case. He said expressions on license plates arent purely the governments expression of messages it approves. Legislators themselves recognized that the tags were intended to be a forum for private expression by the people who buy them.

A person who sees a North Carolina Id Rather Be Shaggin  specialty plate during Monday morning rush hour surely does not routinely and reasonably believe that such a plate embodies the State of North Carolinas credo, Wynn wrote. Nor is it likely that a North Carolina Libertarian who applies for a Dont Tread On Me specialty plate is motivated by a desire to convey to the public the governments seal of approval.

The Supreme Courts decision must have recognized that allowing officials alone to determine government speech would allow it to discriminate against disfavored speakers and messages at will, Wynn wrote. Its implausible that the Supreme Court meant to force us to choose that the mule in this case is either a horse or a donkey.

The legal fight has blocked the state Division of Motor Vehicles from producing the Choose Life tags.

The American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina, which sued to block the Choose Life plates, issued a statement urging the General Assembly to allow pro-abortion rights supporters to also express themselves.

Cornered a day earlier into making stark promises on deportation policies that will be difficult to keep, Hillary Clinton on Thursday rallied supporters at a historical Cuban-American district here, notably breezing over one key issue: immigration.

Clinton spoke before a diverse crowd in Ybor City, a traditional haven for waves of Cuban immigrants, where she largely shied away from addressing the issues that dominated the Democratic debate a night earlier.

Instead, she mixed a general election pitch with an appeal on hyper-local issues, touching on climate change and infrastructure investment, leaving out any mention of the cultural significance of the citys historical downtown or the communitys ties to Cuba.

But in a state where Hispanics are not a monolithic voting bloc  Cubans and Puerto Ricans each account for roughly 30 percent of Latino voters  the pitch to Hispanics is a delicate dance in crafting a message that will resonate with all groups.

And in light of Sanders upset victory in Michigan this week, the Clinton campaign is not taking any chances, particularly in a diverse swing state that is bound to play a determinative role in the general election.

I want to be a really strong candidate to take my vision and our views into a general election against whoever the Republicans nominate, Clinton said. You know, people ask me all the time, well, who do I want to run against. Thats not for me to decide. But given what theyve all said, I will take any one of them.

The Sanders campaign is relying on the Sunshine States makeup to keep the Vermont senator competitive for the Democratic nomination. A diverse array of surrogates on the road with him opened his rallies by speaking to their backgrounds growing up in minority communities.

They are tired of living in the shadows, tired of living in fear, and I agree with them when they want and they are fighting for comprehensive immigration reform and a path to citizenship.

Both candidates have faced intense pressure to stake the most bold and progressive stances on immigration seen yet. Raising the stakes, both candidates at Wednesdays Democratic debate appeared to promise to not deport any children or adults without criminal records  a clear departure from the status quo.

They are vows that some Latinos say they had been waiting to hear but were fearful that they were too good to be true.

Last nights civil GOP debate helped Trump

Individually, we get why Donald Trumps rivals mostly backed away from challenging the GOP frontrunner in last nights 12th  and possibly final  Republican debate. For Marco Rubio, who saw his fav/unfav drop eight points in the past month in the NBC/WSJ poll, the nicer debate allowed him to dial back from the nasty, personal insults that dominated the previous two gatherings. For Ted Cruz, the current status quo helps him get closer to his desired one-on-one matchup against Trump. And for John Kasich, he simply followed the same strategy hes been using throughout this race. But collectively, backing off from challenging Trump only helps the frontrunner. Dont get us wrong: Rubio took issue with Trump doubling down on his Islam hates us statement; Rubio and Cruz hit Trump over his support for normalization with Cuba; and Cruz again questioned Trumps Republican credentials. But none of Trumps rivals made the explicit case why the GOP frontrunner should be stopped. And folks, we are four days away from Trump having a firm grip on the Republican nomination by winning Florida and/or Ohio.

Its on the candidate for setting the tone at his/her rallies

Now its time to turn to the video of that sucker punch at this weeks Trump rally, as well as the allegation (denied by the campaign) that a reporter was roughed up by Trumps campaign manager. Asked about the sucker punch by NBCs Katy Tur, Trump responded, Things can happen, but we really want to be gentle, we want to be nice. Every once in a while, we have somebody that goes wild. I mean, you know, you have a protester that is out of order but we have not had a problem until this one. Trump is maybe right that isnt responsible for an individuals actions. But its on the candidate to set the tone for his events. And if things are getting out of hand, its on the candidate to dial it back.

Why the 2016 primary season will likely last another three months

Both Trump and Hillary Clinton are leading their respective delegate races. But even among the rosiest of scenarios for both, its possible  if not likely  that they wont reach their magic numbers to clinch their nominations until the final primaries on June 7. Donald Trump currently has a 95-delegate lead over his closest competitor Ted Cruz, 459-364, according to NBCs count. If he wins both Florida and Ohio next week (and wins the other delegates at the percentage hes currently getting), he will stand at 721 delegates, which is 516 short of the magic 1,237 number to clinch the nomination. So to reach 1,237 delegates BEFORE June 7  when California and four other states hold their primaries  Trump would need to win about 80 percent of the delegates up for grabs between March 16-May 24. And thats unlikely to happen, even under the best circumstances for Trump if he continues to have an opponent (say Cruz and/or John Kasich).

Clintons on path to hit magic number in May or June

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by more than 600 delegates (when you include superdelegates), 1,194 to 569. That is 1,189 delegates short of the 2,383 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. For Clinton to reach 2,383 BEFORE June, she would need to win 58 percent of the remaining pledged delegates  her current pledged percentage against Sanders  between now and May 17 (a total of 1,930 pledged delegates), as well as add to her superdelegate lead (with 200-plus undeclared superdelegates remaining). So clinching the nomination by May is doable for Clinton, but not if Sanders starts pulling off more surprises like his Michigan victory on Tuesday. If Clinton and Sanders split the remaining 1,930 pledged delegates 50-50, as well as the undecided superdelegates, Clinton wont hit 2,383 until June. By the way, for Sanders to hit 2,383, he will need to win 60% of all remaining delegates, including superdelegates.

Obama: Dont blame me for Trump

Asked at yesterdays news conference if he bore any responsibility for Donald Trumps rise as some critics have suggested, President Obama answered, I have been blamed by Republicans for a lot of things, but being blamed for their primaries and who theyre selecting for their party is novel. He added, I dont think that I was the one to prompt questions about my birth certificate, for example. And: So what youre seeing within the Republican Party is, to some degree, all those efforts over a course of time creating an environment where somebody like a Donald Trump can thrive. Hes just doing more of what has been done for the last seven and a half years. Also, dont miss this troll effort by Obama during last nights state dinner honoring Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau. After all, where else could a boy born in Calgary grow up to run for President of the United States? Obama asked.

msnbc.com,,Six women politicians shifting the local political landscape,[],"Trailblazing is a common quality among the six newly announced nominees for EMILYs Lists third annual Gabrielle Giffords Rising Star Award, including the first Latina and youngest woman to be elected the House Majority Leader in Colorado and the first Asian-American woman in the Michigan legislature.

The award honors an extraordinary woman serving in local or state office. Five female state representatives and one female county clerk were nominated for this years award, according to a statement from EMILYs List, the nations largest organization dedicated to raising money to support pro-choice Democratic women candidates. The group will be seeking input from the community to choose a winner by collecting votes online. The Rising Star Award recognizes a woman serving in office who not only breaks glass ceilings but also demonstrates the sort of commitment to community, dedication to women and families, and determination and civility that have been the highlights of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords career, in and out of office.

RELATED: Women in politics

Each leader has displayed a kind of fearlessness and dedication that has allowed them to have major impact on their respective communities. In such a history-making year for women in politics, EMILYs List couldnt be prouder to recognize the achievements of our local leaders who are standing up for women and families across the country, said Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILYs List, in a statement.

A majority of the nominees for the 2016 award have broken barriers within their legislatures. Rep. Stephanie Chang was the first Asian-American woman elected to the Michigan legislature in 2014. Chang has also focused on advancing earned paid sick leave bills and environmental justice issues, as well as starting a fellowship for high school girls of color.

Another nominee, Ohio state Rep. Kathleen Clyde was the youngest female member of the Ohio General Assembly when she was elected in 2010, and she has dedicated her time in the Ohio legislature to addressing voting rights issues.

In 2015, the percentage of women represented in Congress hit a record high with women comprising 19.4 percent of the House and Senate chambers. Of the 104 women serving in Congress in 2015, only 33 of them were women of color, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. The nominees for this years Giffords Rising Star Award continue to show the organizations dedication to improving the representation of not just women, but specifically women of color in politics.

Colorado state Rep. Crisanta Duran is the first Latina and youngest woman to be elected to the House Majority Leader position in Colorado. Some issues Duran works to address involve workforce development, affordable housing, and immigrant rights.

Meanwhile, Pennsylvania state Rep. Leanne Krueger-Braneky was the first woman elected to represent 161st House District in the state. Krueger-Braneky has also helped shift the state supreme court in Pennsylvania to a pro-choice majority during her time in office.

RELATED: The women bridging tech and politics in the 2016 election

New Jersey state Rep. Shavonda Sumter, who has held her position since 2012, also continues the nominee trailblazing standard as a legislator with the most bills  16  signed into law by Gov. Chris Christie in 2014. Sumter also pushes for policies regarding an increase in minimum wage, ending discriminatory hiring practices and expanding accessibility to mental health treatment.

The final nominee, Maggie Toulouse Oliver, the Bernalillo County Clerk in New Mexico, is currently running for secretary of state. Like EMILYs List, Toulouse Oliver has also pushed to support pro-choice women running for political office by founding MaggiePAC in 2015 to help financially back such candidates.

Previous winners of the Gabrielle Giffords Rising Star Award include Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams and most recently Boston City Councilwoman Ayanna Pressley. Abrams was the first woman to lead a party in the Georgia General Assembly and the first African-American lead in the Georgia House. Pressley also continued to break molds for African-American women by becoming the first woman of color to be elected to Boston City Council in its 100-year-plus history.",[]

Last nights civil GOP debate helped Trump

Individually, we get why Donald Trumps rivals mostly backed away from challenging the GOP frontrunner in last nights 12th  and possibly final  Republican debate. For Marco Rubio, who saw his fav/unfav drop eight points in the past month in the NBC/WSJ poll, the nicer debate allowed him to dial back from the nasty, personal insults that dominated the previous two gatherings. For Ted Cruz, the current status quo helps him get closer to his desired one-on-one matchup against Trump. And for John Kasich, he simply followed the same strategy hes been using throughout this race. But collectively, backing off from challenging Trump only helps the frontrunner. Dont get us wrong: Rubio took issue with Trump doubling down on his Islam hates us statement; Rubio and Cruz hit Trump over his support for normalization with Cuba; and Cruz again questioned Trumps Republican credentials. But none of Trumps rivals made the explicit case why the GOP frontrunner should be stopped. And folks, we are four days away from Trump having a firm grip on the Republican nomination by winning Florida and/or Ohio.

Its on the candidate for setting the tone at his/her rallies

Now its time to turn to the video of that sucker punch at this weeks Trump rally, as well as the allegation (denied by the campaign) that a reporter was roughed up by Trumps campaign manager. Asked about the sucker punch by NBCs Katy Tur, Trump responded, Things can happen, but we really want to be gentle, we want to be nice. Every once in a while, we have somebody that goes wild. I mean, you know, you have a protester that is out of order but we have not had a problem until this one. Trump is maybe right that isnt responsible for an individuals actions. But its on the candidate to set the tone for his events. And if things are getting out of hand, its on the candidate to dial it back.

Why the 2016 primary season will likely last another three months

Both Trump and Hillary Clinton are leading their respective delegate races. But even among the rosiest of scenarios for both, its possible  if not likely  that they wont reach their magic numbers to clinch their nominations until the final primaries on June 7. Donald Trump currently has a 95-delegate lead over his closest competitor Ted Cruz, 459-364, according to NBCs count. If he wins both Florida and Ohio next week (and wins the other delegates at the percentage hes currently getting), he will stand at 721 delegates, which is 516 short of the magic 1,237 number to clinch the nomination. So to reach 1,237 delegates BEFORE June 7  when California and four other states hold their primaries  Trump would need to win about 80 percent of the delegates up for grabs between March 16-May 24. And thats unlikely to happen, even under the best circumstances for Trump if he continues to have an opponent (say Cruz and/or John Kasich).

Clintons on path to hit magic number in May or June

On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders by more than 600 delegates (when you include superdelegates), 1,194 to 569. That is 1,189 delegates short of the 2,383 needed to clinch the Democratic nomination. For Clinton to reach 2,383 BEFORE June, she would need to win 58 percent of the remaining pledged delegates  her current pledged percentage against Sanders  between now and May 17 (a total of 1,930 pledged delegates), as well as add to her superdelegate lead (with 200-plus undeclared superdelegates remaining). So clinching the nomination by May is doable for Clinton, but not if Sanders starts pulling off more surprises like his Michigan victory on Tuesday. If Clinton and Sanders split the remaining 1,930 pledged delegates 50-50, as well as the undecided superdelegates, Clinton wont hit 2,383 until June. By the way, for Sanders to hit 2,383, he will need to win 60% of all remaining delegates, including superdelegates.

Obama: Dont blame me for Trump

Asked at yesterdays news conference if he bore any responsibility for Donald Trumps rise as some critics have suggested, President Obama answered, I have been blamed by Republicans for a lot of things, but being blamed for their primaries and who theyre selecting for their party is novel. He added, I dont think that I was the one to prompt questions about my birth certificate, for example. And: So what youre seeing within the Republican Party is, to some degree, all those efforts over a course of time creating an environment where somebody like a Donald Trump can thrive. Hes just doing more of what has been done for the last seven and a half years. Also, dont miss this troll effort by Obama during last nights state dinner honoring Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau. After all, where else could a boy born in Calgary grow up to run for President of the United States? Obama asked.

msnbc.com,,"Five takeaways from a kinder, gentler Republican debate",[],"Miami, Fla.  If Donald Trump wins Marco Rubios home state and John Kasichs home state on Tuesday, hell take a massive leap towards securing the Republican nomination and likely end both of their campaigns.

You wouldnt know it from watching Thursday nights debate, however, where the field seemed content to go gentle into that good night. The debate featured polite disagreements but few outright attacks and a number of substantive exchanges over issues like trade and foreign policy.

If recent polls showing Trump leading Florida and either leading or competitive in Ohio are correct, a quiet debate seems most likely to benefit Trump.

Here were five takeaways from the last GOP debate before the March 15 contests.

Calm before the storm

After a wild pair of debates characterized by continuous battles between Trump and his rivals, the field seemed to decide that the time had come to tone things down.

I cannot believe how civil its been up here, Trump said during one exchange.

That doesnt mean there werent disagreements. Cruz went after Trump for funding liberal Democrats with years of campaign donations. Rubio criticized Trump for saying he would stay neutral in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which Trump countered by saying he was still pro-Israel. Overall, though, it was a cozy affair compared to the recent debates.

Whats less clear is why it was so quiet. Rubio admitted this week that he made a mistake in taunting Trump over the size of his body parts, but he didnt press his critique on Trumps con artist business record, either. Trump toning it down would make sense if he believes he has a winning hand heading into Tuesday, but that hasnt stopped him from unleashing the fury in similar situations.

Trump and the violence issue

The mood onstage stood in contrast to the news around Trump recently, which has focused more and more on violence at his events, which Trump sometimes appears to egg on from the podium and in interviews.

The issue has been simmering throughout the race but reached a raging boil this week after a Trump supporter was arrested for sucker-punching a protester and Trumps campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was accused of violently grabbing Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields after she approached Trump to ask a question. Close video Trump on alleged altercation between campaign manager, reporter NBCs Katy Tur asks Donald Trump about a recent incident at his campaign rally where a man was charged with assault after punching a protester and an alleged altercation between Trumps campaign manager and a reporter. embed like save share group

Trump complained protesters were swinging at people at his events, something three full-time Trump reporters said on Twitter that they had not witnessed, although NBC News embed Ali Vitali noted one incident in which a protester tried to bite an attendee.

As for Fields, Trump accused her of fabricating the story despite an eyewitness account from a Washington Post journalist and an audio recording of the incident in which the two reporters recounted what had happened in real time.

Perhaps she made the story up  I think thats what happened, Trump said after the debate.

In keeping with the friendly nature of the debate, none of Trumps rivals criticized him over the issue.

Rubios dignified debate

If Rubio goes down on Tuesday, he wants to go down with dignity.

For what could be his final debate, Rubio decided to get back to his roots and focused on a more uplifting message with more emphasis on policy. I believe at the end of this process, the nation will make the right choice, because Ive always believed that God has blessed this country, that Gods hand is on this country and that its greatest days are yet to come, he said in his closing remarks.

Rubio connected well with the home crowd, but there was a reason he abandoned his old approach months ago. He has to hope the contrast sways voters better now that there are fewer people onstage.

Delegate math

Trump and Cruz declined to attack the others in the race, but they both made clear that their rivals should consider leaving the race given their significant deficit in the delegate race.

Theres two of us up here that can [win] and there are two of us that cannot at this moment, Trump said.

Donald is right, Cruz said in his answer. There are only two of us that have a path to winning the nomination, Donald and myself.

Rubio said he was going to work tirelessly every single day out of respect for his supporters but offered no answer as to how he could win without a contested convention.

Kasich said, Math doesnt tell the whole story in politics.

Trade war

One of the more interesting policy exchanges was over trade, the rare issue thats become a significant fight in both party primaries. Earlier this week, Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders won an upset in Michigan in a race where anger over trade deals  opposed by Sanders  figured prominently.

Trump took up the mantle on Friday, reiterating his protectionist philosophy and threatening to slap a 45 percent tariff on imported goods from China.

Rubio, by contrast, offered a defense of trade based on conservative free market principles. Were 5 percent of the worlds population, he said. If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth.

Cruz, who has shifted his position somewhat towards Trump on trade deals, noted that Trumps tariffs would significantly raise prices for working Americans. He pledged to try to negotiate better treaties to alleviate the problem while cutting taxes for businesses to make them more competitive.",[]

msnbc.com,,Hillary Clinton on Donald Trump rally violence: He is 'urging people on',[],"In an interview with MSNBCs Rachel Maddow on Thursday night, Hillary Clinton suggested Republican front-runner Donald Trump is egging on violence at his raucous rallies.

After a day dominated by stories about violence perpetrated by Trump supporters  and even allegedly his campaign manager  Clinton said she was truly distraught and even appalled by a lot of what I see going on at his events.

Mr. Trump should not be urging people on. This is deeply distressing, and I think as the campaign goes further, more and more Americans are going to be, you know, really disturbed by the kind of campaign hes running, she said. You know, you cant just be flailing around inside the White House saying whatever comes out of your mouth. Markets rise and fall. Conflicts can begin or get worse.

And for the second time in two days, Clinton put some distance between herself and President Obama.

With an eye on Tuesdays primary contests in states hit hard by manufacturing job losses blamed on free trade agreements, Clinton said the president whom she usually sticks close to needs to do more.

I wish the Obama administration right now would crack down on Chinas dumping of steel into our market. You know, that should not be permitted. We have some tools that are available to this administration. Id like to see them use it, and Id like to send a very clear message to China: You may have your own economic problems, but dont try to undermine and take away jobs in our steel industry any more than you already have, Clinton said.

The US steel industry has been hit hard in the so-called Rust Belt, including Ohio, Missouri and Illinois, which all vote next week. She also mentioned her opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a massive new trade deal with a dozen Pacific countries backed by the White House.

I think in some of these areas, like opposing [Obama] on TPP, I did hope that we would get an agreement I could support. It turned out I couldnt, Clinton said. I am speaking out and I am urging the administration not to go forward with market economy [status for China] and to crack down on dumping of steel.

In Wednesday nights Democratic debate hosted by the Spanish-language channel Univision in Miami, Clinton also criticized the administrations deportation raids. She repeated that criticism in her interview with Maddow, but also seemed to soften an apparent pledge from the night before not to deport undocumented immigrants without a criminal record.

I dont like the raids, I dont like the roundups, I dont like the level of deportation that weve been seeing in this administration, she said.

But she said she would not move to Canada if Trump were to win the presidency. I would never leave our country, but I would certainly be spending a lot of time yelling at the TV set, Clinton said.",[]

msnbc.com,,"In debate, Republicans replace bad behavior with bad answers",[],"What a difference a week makes. When the four remaining Republican presidential candidates gathered eight days ago for a debate in Detroit, it marked a low point, not only for the 2016 race, but perhaps for the modern GOP itself  the event was more of a junior-high food fight than a discussion of ideas. The Republicans and their audience put on a vulgar and offensive display, reinforcing fears of a party thats gone completely over the edge.

L ast night in Miami was, well, different. If we lower the bar for propriety to a ridiculous level, and say any debate in which a presidential frontrunner refrains from talking about his penis is a success, then sure, the 12th gathering of the Republican presidential field was a vast improvement over the 11th.

But its also fair to say that isnt much of a standard for a global superpower in the 21st century.

Perhaps the most memorable quote of the evening came about a third of the way through the debate, when Donald Trump took a moment to acknowledge what many were thinking. From the transcript

I would say this. Were all in this together. Were going to come up with solutions. Were going to find the answers to things. And so far I cannot believe how civil its been up here.

And given what happened seven days earlier, no one else could believe it, either. It led to borderline celebratory headlines such as , GOP candidates set aside insults, talk about policy and Who Won the Debate? Substance Over Theater.

At a certain level, the praise reflects a degree of relief  I think many journalists would have been satisfied last night if the candidates resisted the urge to literally drop their pants  but I think words like policy and substance should probably come with scare quotes.

Because while the GOP presidential hopefuls managed not to embarrass themselves of their party last night with juvenile taunts and ugly boasts, they also reminded voters that the Republican candidates have no idea what theyre talking about.

Voxs Ezra Klein explained overnight that this may have been the most substantive clash of the cycle, but the substance was wrong.

So was this debate substantive? Sure, in the sense that it focused on weighty policy topics like Social Security and trade and the assembled candidates mostly used their inside voices. But the things the candidates actually said were, by turns, wrong, misleading, misinformed, confused, or ridiculous. This substantive debate mostly showed how weak a grasp on the issues the candidates actually have.

Its honestly difficult to think of any area of public policy the Republicans candidates described accurately. They were wrong about basic, factual details regarding the economy, the environment, foreign policy, the budget, Social Security, education, and defense spending, among other things.

When presidential candidates say wrong things in a calm demeanor, its hardly a triumph. Our collective expectations for the GOP field have fallen to such a low level that watching them make bogus claims about reality for two hours seems impressive  because no one held up their hands to show how big they are.

As for the broader political context, its unlikely last nights debate will have a significant impact on the race overall. Trumps rivals not only kept the gloves on, they seemed to pull every punch, making no real effort to take the frontrunner down a peg. The New York Republican, meanwhile, shifted his tone, presenting himself as the likely nominee who no longer feels the need to knock the rivals hes already defeating.",[]
msnbc.com,,Obama rejects blame for Republicans' embrace of Trump,[],"In recent weeks, the Republican campaign to blame President Obama for Donald Trumps rise has become surprisingly common. What started with a silly piece from the Wall Street Journal editorial board has spread and evolved to other pundits and even some politicians.

Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) said last week that whats happening in the Republican primary is at least partly the result of years of anger with the overreach of the Obama administration. Soon after, former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal (R) argued that were it not for the Democratic presidents level-headed style, Republicans wouldnt have felt obligated to support such a fool.

Yesterday, a reporter asked the president, Some of your critics have pointed to the incredibly polarized political climate under your administration as contributing to the rise of someone as provocative as Donald Trump. Do you feel responsibility for that? Given his response , it appears Obama has given the issue some thought.

Ive actually heard this argument a number of times. I have been blamed by Republicans for a lot of things, but being blamed for their primaries and who theyre selecting for their party is novel. Look, Ive said  I said it at the State of the Union that one of my regrets is the degree to which polarization and the nasty tone of our politics has accelerated rather than waned over the course of the last seven and a half years. And I do all kinds of soul-searching in terms of are there things I can do better to make sure that were unifying the country. But I also have to say, Margaret, that, objectively, its fair to say that the Republican political elites and many of the information outlets  social media, news outlets, talk radio, television stations  have been feeding the Republican base for the last seven years a notion that everything I do is to be opposed; that cooperation or compromise somehow is a betrayal; that maximalist, absolutist positions on issues are politically advantageous; that there is a them out there and an us, and them are the folks who are causing whatever problems youre experiencing.

The president added that its the Republicans efforts from recent years thats responsible for creating an environment where somebody like a Donald Trump can thrive. Hes just doing more of what has been done for the last seven and a half years.... [T]here are thoughtful conservatives who are troubled by this, who are troubled by the direction of their party. I think it is very important for them to reflect on what it is about the politics theyve engaged in that allows the circus weve been seeing to transpire, and to do some introspection.

Thatd be easier, of course, if there were more in the GOP prepared to identify the intra-party crisis that opened the door to Trump, and fewer looking for ways to blame Democrats.

Obama went on to say that he actually wants an effective Republican Party, not reasons that have anything to do with electoral politics, but because the country has to have responsible parties that can govern, and that are prepared to lead and govern whether theyre in the minority or in the majority, whether they occupy the White House or they do not. And Ive often said I want a serious, effective Republican Party  in part to challenge some of the blind spots and dogmas in the Democratic Party. I think thats useful.",[]

msnbc.com,,Ted Cruz finally finds one Senate ally,[],"National Review, a prominent conservative media outlet, ran into a little trouble on Monday when reporting on Ted Cruz. The magazine initially said the Texas Republican was set to unveil endorsements from more than four senators this week, but that was retracted . An update added that the Cruz campaign actually has no pending Senate endorsements to announce.

Soon after, National Review clarified matters once more, saying Cruz would unveil at least one Senate endorsement as early as this week.

That announcement came yesterday when Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), perhaps best known for his role in blocking federal aid to Flint, Michigan, threw his official backing behind the Cruz campaign.

While Cruz has become a divisive figure within the Republican conference in the Senate, Lee is considered one of his only allies, and at a recent campaign stop, Cruz said Lee was someone I love like a brother. But Lee had not endorsed until today, instead choosing to campaign for Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida.

Perhaps the most notable thing about Lees endorsement is its uniqueness: other than Cruz himself, there are 53 Senate Republicans, and before yesterday, not one of them support the Texans candidacy. Lees announcement stands out in large part because he stands alone.

But thats not the only reason yesterdays endorsement matters. Lees office had said the Utah Republican would remain neutral until either Cruz or Rubio dropped out of the presidential race. The fact that Lee was willing to take himself off the fence yesterday suggests he sees Rubios candidacy as effectively, if not literally, over.

In fact, he said as much yesterday. Lee, who co-wrote a tax-reform bill with Rubio, specifically told reporters yesterday that he hopes the Floridian quits the 2016 race in order to get behind Ted Cruz. Lee also urged other Senate Republicans to follow his lead, though that seems highly unlikely, at least in the short term.

But before we move on, The New Republic flagged an interesting tidbit that Id forgotten about.

[B]efore you rejoice that Ted Cruz, Washingtons loneliest man, has finally found a friend, remember this. When Lee proposed a bipartisan criminal defense bill that was supported by both the Koch brothers and the ACLU, Cruz stood before the Senate and decried the bill for something it didnt do: releasing violent criminals from prison early. Lee, who was given no advance warning, was understandably horrified: He may have endorsed Cruz, but that doesnt mean hes forgiven him.",[]

But Lee had not endorsed until today, instead choosing to campaign for Cruz and Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida.

Perhaps the most notable thing about Lees endorsement is its uniqueness: other than Cruz himself, there are 53 Senate Republicans, and before yesterday, not one of them support the Texans candidacy. Lees announcement stands out in large part because he stands alone.

But thats not the only reason yesterdays endorsement matters. Lees office had said the Utah Republican would remain neutral until either Cruz or Rubio dropped out of the presidential race. The fact that Lee was willing to take himself off the fence yesterday suggests he sees Rubios candidacy as effectively, if not literally, over.

In fact, he said as much yesterday. Lee, who co-wrote a tax-reform bill with Rubio, specifically told reporters yesterday that he hopes the Floridian quits the 2016 race in order to get behind Ted Cruz. Lee also urged other Senate Republicans to follow his lead, though that seems highly unlikely, at least in the short term.

But before we move on, The New Republic flagged an interesting tidbit that Id forgotten about.

[B]efore you rejoice that Ted Cruz, Washingtons loneliest man, has finally found a friend, remember this. When Lee proposed a bipartisan criminal defense bill that was supported by both the Koch brothers and the ACLU, Cruz stood before the Senate and decried the bill for something it didnt do: releasing violent criminals from prison early. Lee, who was given no advance warning, was understandably horrified: He may have endorsed Cruz, but that doesnt mean hes forgiven him.",[]

Floridas winner-take-all primary was rigged by the establishment to provide a firewall for Jeb Bush or Rubio back when wise men spoke knowingly of an establishment lane. Instead, as with most of the maneuvers masterminded by the Republican National Committee, the Florida firewall now seems to be playing into the hands of the man Beltway Republicans hate the most. And after Tuesday night, the only politician who has any chance of stopping Trump seven days from now is the second-most hated politician in Washington, Ted Cruz. Sen. Lindsey Graham likens the choice between Cruz and Trump as being similar to having to choose death by firing squad or from drinking poison.

Trump told reporters after Thursday nights GOP debate in Miami that nothing happened.

Perhaps she made the story up. I think thats what happened, he said of Tuesday nights alleged incident.

I believe I was in the middle of a lot of Secret Service agents, and they all said that they never saw anything, Trump said. And these are very honorable guys, theyre fantastic people, and there were a lot of them and nobody saw anything, and to the best of my knowledge theres no pictures.

VIDEO: Trump to @DylanByers on @MichelleFields incident. I think she made it up. pic.twitter.com/VUB5LnbrTM  Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) March 11, 2016

Breitbarts Michelle Fields accused Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski of grabbing her arm and aggressively yanking her aside after she questioned the candidate about affirmative action following an event in Florida.

Fields wrote an account of the incident  which a Washington Post journalist reportedly witnessed. Politico published an audio transcript that purportedly captures the interaction and moments immediately afterward when the Washington Post reporter claims it was Lewandowski who committed the alleged assault.

The Trump campaign manager attacked Fields in a series of tweets, calling her an attention seeker  which prompted the journalist to tweet a picture of her bruised arm.

I guess these just magically appeared on me @CLewandowski_ @realDonaldTrump. So weird. pic.twitter.com/oD8c4D7tw3  Michelle Fields (@MichelleFields) March 10, 2016

Lewandowski later continued to tweet about Fields, calling her an attention seeker and questioning her journalistic integrity.

Trumps campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks also cast aspersions on Fields reporting, saying in a statement that the Breitbart reporter had never met Lewandowski.

Breitbart said it was disappointed in the campaigns response and in particular their effort to demean Fields previous reporting.

We stand behind her reporting, her techniques, and call again on Corey Lewandowski to apologize, the conservative news sites CEO Larry Solov said in a statement.

msnbc.com,,Why Cruz is walking away from the Florida primary,[],"With just four days remaining before the Florida primary, its hard to know what to make of some of the recent statewide polls. Looking at the data released this week, for every poll that shows Donald Trumps lead over Marco Rubio growing to around 20 points, theres another that shows Trumps advantage shrinking to single digits.

Rubio hasnt led in any statewide poll in his own home state since mid-April 2015

With this in mind, Ted Cruzs operation leaked word several days ago that it would head into the Sunshine State this week, undermine Rubios support, and knock the senator out of the race once and for all. It would include a series of new field offices and a major advertising investment from a Cruz super PAC.

As of late yesterday, however, NBC News Vaughn Hillyard found that those plans have been deemed unnecessary

The super PACs backing Ted Cruz are opting to skip airing television ads in Florida before next Tuesdays primary, despite the Cruz campaign hyping up its own effort to prevent rival Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio from winning his delegate-rich home state. We looked at the numbers, and we decided that Marco Rubio can lose Florida all by himself, said Kellyanne Conway, president of the Keep the Promise, the multiple super PAC entities backing Cruz. He doesnt need our help.

The super PAC chief said with Rubio struggling in Florida, and John Kasich battling Trump in Ohio, Keep the Promise will direct resources into Missouri, North Carolina and Illinois  the other three states hosting nominating contests on Tuesday.

[W]ere trying to cover a broader swath of territory  a multi-state contest requires multi-state coverage, Conway added.

So, heres the question for which there is no obvious answer: was Team Cruz ever serious about Florida, or was it playing a psych-out game against Team Rubio? Is Cruz changing direction or completing one of the years biggest head-fakes?

The Cruz campaign announced earlier this week, for example, that it was in the process of opening 10 Florida field offices this week, but as Politicos Marc Caputo discussed with Rachel the other day, its not clear if those offices ever actually existed.

Now, on the heels of those questions, Cruzs super PAC, which made headlines on Monday boasting about its ambitious anti-Rubio plans in the senators home state, has suddenly decided not to bother with Florida after all.

Its possible, of course, that theres no chicanery going on. Maybe Cruz really did open those offices. Perhaps Cruzs super PAC had every intention of buying airtime in Florida. Maybe Team Cruz genuinely believes Rubio is doomed to lose on Tuesday.",[]

msnbc.com,,Wounded Warrior Project fires top two executives amid reports of lavish spending,['Elizabeth Chuck'],"The top two executives at the prominent veterans charity Wounded Warrior Project have been fired amid allegations of extravagant spending on themselves and their employees.

The board of directors fired chief executive officer Steven Nardizzi and chief operating officer Al Giordano Thursday after an independent review found some policies, procedures and controls at WWP have not kept pace with the organizations rapid growth in recent years and are in need of strengthening, according to a statement from the nonprofit sent to NBC News.

The charity, one of the largest in the nation for veterans, has been mired in controversy since January, when a CBS News investigation found many of its donations were being going toward employees: $26 million on company conferences in 2014 alone, according to CBS News.

Of the millions of dollars in donations received each year by Wounded Warrior Project, just 54 to 60 percent actually goes to vets, CBS News reported. The rest goes to overhead  air travel, luxury resorts, and over-the-top parties. Other veterans charities have overhead costs that dont exceed 10 or 15 percent, CBS said.

Wounded Warrior Project denied those numbers in its statement, which was sent to NBC News from PR firm Abernathy MacGregor. It said a preliminary financial audit indicates 80 percent of its budget went to vets.

Employees told CBS News spending skyrocketed once Nardizzi took over as CEO in 2009, citing a 2014 annual company meeting held at a Colorado Springs luxury resort.

He rappelled down the side of a building at one of the all-hands events. Hes come in on a Segway, hes come in on a horse, one former employee, speaking on condition of anonymity, told CBS.

The nonprofit said Thursday it has already put policies in place that will cut down on employee expenses, such as having employees fly economy class.

Nonetheless, it added, to best effectuate these changes and help restore trust in the organization among all of the constituencies WWP serves, the Board determined the organization would benefit from new leadership, and WWP CEO Steve Nardizzi and COO Al Giordano are no longer with the organization.

Anthony Odierno, the nonprofits chairman, will serve as interim CEO, it said.

msnbc.com,,Scrambling to clean up a failed Republican governor's mess,[],"In November, Louisianas John Bel Edwards received some great news: by a wide margin , the Democrat had been elected governor. At the same time, however, he also received some rather dreadful news: Edwards was now the governor of Louisiana, responsible for cleaning up a catastrophic mess left by Republican Bobby Jindal.

As the New York Times reported yesterday, Pelican State policymakers  a Democratic governors office working with a Republican-led legislature  are moving forward with a plan to undo some of what Jindal did, at least temporarily.

Facing the threat of layoffs, cancellation of university classes and a suspension of health care services, state lawmakers avoided more than $900 million in budget cuts by passing a package of tax increases and spending reductions Wednesday in the closing moments of a special session. But large shortfalls still plague the state and will continue to play out as a regular session convenes on Monday.

The package includes restructuring the state sales tax  removing exemptions and increasing it a penny  but at Republicans insistence, the increases are temporary. The New York Times article added that the new agreement also includes higher taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, car rentals, cellphones, landlines and short-term rooms booked through websites. Policymakers also rolled back a tax credit enjoyed by the insurance industry, and they approved a framework for collecting sales taxes from online retailers.

Despite this, the package didnt close all of the states massive budget shortfall, and more cuts are on the way.

Bobby Jindals failures were just that bad. The Washington Post added last week:

Already, the state of Louisiana had gutted university spending and depleted its rainy-day funds. It had cut 30,000 employees and furloughed others. It had slashed the number of child services staffers, including those devoted to foster family recruitment, and young abuse victims for the first time were spending nights at government offices. And then, the states new governor, John Bel Edwards (D), came on TV and said the worst was yet to come.

The source of the crisis is hardly a mystery. As the Post reported, experts have found that Louisianas structural budget deficit emerged and then grew under former governor Bobby Jindal, who, during his eight years in office, reduced the states revenue by offering tax breaks to the middle class and wealthy. He also created new subsidies aimed at luring and keeping businesses. Those policies, state data show, didnt deliver the desired economic growth.

In other words, a right-wing governor, working with a Republican legislature, tried to implement a conservative governing agenda. The result is a disaster Louisiana is going to struggle for years to clean up.

msnbc.com,,How Bernie Sanders hopes to pull a Michigan in Ohio,[],"CLEVELAND  Its a Thursday night, five days out from Election Day, and Nina Turner is trying to find people to volunteer for Bernie Sanders in the citys overwhelmingly black East Side.

Its not easy. Working the phone banks never is. You never get to too big to phone bank, thats my opinion, says Turner, a former state senator who has made a national name for herself after rising through the political ranks on the East Side. But its especially difficult when youre running against Hillary Clinton, who has built a reputation for coalescing the black vote in every 2016 Democratic contest to date  that is, except for one.

In Tuesdays primary in Michigan, Clinton won African-Americans by less overwhelming margins, beating Sanders among blacks 68 percent to 28 percent instead of the 80-20 or worse split seen in Southern states. That may sound like a minor change, but the 10-point dip in Clintons black support could have cost her Michigan and augurs trouble in states like Ohio, Illinois, and Missouri, which hold primaries on Tuesday.

RELATED: Sanders surprise win and Clintons defeat: What happened in Michigan?



Sanders strategists are hoping to do Michigan all over again, but this time in Ohio, a state whose rivalry with Michigan belies their similarities. Theyre under no illusions they can win a majority of African-American voters, but even getting to 30 percent would be a coup that could deliver victories, given Sanders strength with white voters.

Theyre counting on young people and Sanders anti-establishment message to get them there. And allies think Sanders can do better with black voters outside the South, where Clinton has a long history with the core Democratic voting bloc, and they think later contests have given Sanders more time to introduce himself to people who didnt previously know him. view photo essay The presidential campaign: Bernie Sanders The self-described democratic socialist is known for pushing change on income inequality, college affordability and criminal justice reform.

Clinton is currently beating Sanders by wide margins in recent Ohio polls. While theres no data on her strength with African-Americans specifically, a CNN poll found Ohio Democrats trusted her on race relations over Sanders 65 percent to 32 percent. But polls also painted a similar picture before Sanders won Michigan, and Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters this week that Ohio would be competitive.

If Sanders succeeds in the winner-takes-all-the-delegates state, his office in a former daycare center on the corner of East 79th Street and Central Avenue could play a key role. On the walls, theres a photo of the candidate fist bumping rapper Killer Mike and campaign t-shirts with the slogan Black Lives Matter under a cartoon silhouette of Sanders face.

The literature on display includes a double-sided flyer (produced by volunteers, not the campaign) that states, Hillary Clinton and her husband have supported policies which have devastated the black community. On the back, there are photos of Sanders marching with Martin Luther King Jr. in Washington and speaking at a meeting of the Congress of Racial Equality, with his face circled.

Nonetheless, many of the nearly dozen volunteers working the phones here white and have ventured to the office from other parts of the city, underscoring Sanders challenge with African-American voters.

But not all are. David Washington, a 26-year-old black East Sider, has been a political junkie since he was 12 years old, when teachers would pull The Cleveland Plain Dealer out of his hands to make him focus on schoolwork.

We were strictly Hillary, Washington says of his group of friends. Mostly everyone of my friends has been saying the same thing. They were all Hillary in the beginning, but once they started seeing Bernie Sanders policies, and started seeing that he had a proven track record going back 40 years, it was just inevitable for them to switch sides.

Free trade policies are at the top of many peoples minds in Washington, as they are for many in Ohio, along with Sanders larger message of economic equality and fighting corporate power  as is Sanders work in the civil rights movement, support for LGBT rights in the 1980s, and current policies on criminal justice reform.

Nicole Bates, 24, said Sanders is well liked by people who have heard his message and will do well with young African-Americans. But she worried about friends who werent registered or seemed apathetic about voting.

The East Side loves Bernie, she said. The question is whether they get out to vote.

Ohio and Michigan have a lot in common when it comes to demographics. They have roughly identical education levels, workforce participation, unemployment rates, and median incomes. Ohio is slightly bigger and slightly whiter  12 percent of Ohio is black, compared to 15 percent of Michigan.

But Clinton allies in the state feel confident about the African-American vote here. She has a lock on the endorsement of virtually every elected official, including Rep. Marcia Fudge, who represents the East Side and whose political operation has been out in force. The campaign has also activated longstanding church and other more informal networks.

To overcome Clintons deep ties to the state, Sanders will need young African-Americans. But he has two things working against him in Ohio: One, the Republican secretary of state recently ruled that 17-year-olds who will be of voting age by the general election can no longer vote in the primary. (Sanders sued to stop that change.) Secondly, many colleges in the state will be on spring break during on Election Day, raising concerns about turnout.

Clinton has also been leaning on the success of her husband, whose popularity with African-Americans earned him the appellation of Americas first black president, and President Obama, the countrys actual first black president. She even put her Cleveland campaign office on the same square Obama put his.

Turner also took issue with that. Secretary Clinton is wrapping herself around the president in the hopes to charm, if you will, the African-American community into voting for her, and I just really find that quite disturbing. she said.

Citing all the negative things Clinton said about Obama in the 2008 primary, Turner said its disingenuous for Clinton to claim close ties to him now. Now all of a sudden, shes got his back. Every other word is about President Obama, President Obama, President Obama, she said. In my mind, that is just a way for her to seduce the African-American community into voting for her.

msnbc.com,,"In the year's weirdest caucus, the winner was ... no one",[],"We tend to think of the race for the Republican presidential nomination as a state-by-state process, but thats not entirely correct  because some of the primaries and caucuses arent held in actual states. Last weekend, for example, Marco Rubio managed to win only his second contest of the year by finishing first in Puerto Rico.

The District of Columbia, American Samoa, the Northern Mariana Islands, and Guam will all soon hold contests of their own.

And then theres the U.S. Virgin Islands, which appears to be home to the years weirdest presidential caucus.

The first sign of trouble came by way of the calendar: news organizations couldnt seem to agree when, exactly, Republicans in the Virgin Islands were supposed to caucus. Several reports said the caucuses would be held on March 19, others said March 10.

The second sign of trouble was the confusion surrounding just how many delegates the Virgin Islands have to offer. The Republican National Committee and several independent tallies put the total at nine, while others say six.

And in case that werent quite enough, consider the results of yesterdays caucuses, and the fact that the official winner was  wait for it  no one. The Associated Press reported

Republicans in the Virgin Islands caucused into the night Thursday, and when they finished counting the votes Friday morning, the winner was ... no one. Party chairman John Canegata says all nine delegates from the U.S. territory will go to the Republican National Convention as uncommitted delegates. That makes them free agents, free to support the candidate of their choice.

Its not that the campaigns didnt care about the contest. In fact, several campaigns dispatched surrogates to the Virgin Islands, and Ted Cruz even sent his father to campaign on his behalf. It didnt seem to do any good.

And while someone usually wins every primary and caucus, and its strange for uncommitted to come out on top in the Virgin Islands, thats not the end of the oddities.

The Washington Post  which said six, not nine, delegates were at stake in yesterdays caucuses  reported that a man named John Yob and his wife led the uncommitted slate of delegates in the Virgin Islands.

And whos John Yob? Im glad you asked. TPM reported yesterday that Yob, who lived in Michigan up until very recently, is a Republican political consultant, the owner of a consulting firm called Strategic National, the former national political director for Rand Paul, and the author of a book about contested political conventions.

TPMs report , which is every bit as bizarre as the rest of this story, explained that Yob and his allies got in a bizarre and messy fight against the supervisor of the U.S. Virgin Islands Election Board.

On March 4, Caroline Fawkes, the supervisor of elections for the U.S. Virgin Islands ruled Yob, his wife Erica L. Yob, and Ethan Eilon and Lindsey Eilon ineligible to vote. All four of them were on the ballot to be delegates, but delegates must be registered Republican voters. Fawkes ruling compromised their eligibility to serve as delegates. According to court documents, Yob was initially ruled ineligible to vote, according to Fawkes, after he tried to register to vote before he had lived in the U.S. Virgin Islands for the required 90 days. According to an email that Fawkes sent to state chairman for the Virgin Islands Republican Party, John Canegata, Yob is alleged to have purposely falsified information to gain access to the polls. Mr. Yob appeared at the St. John Elections Office in order to register to vote in early January. He was informed by the Elections Assistant, he has to reside in the Virgin Islands for ninety days before he can register. He informed the Elections Assistant, he arrived on the island a week before, which made him ineligible. He then took the information gained and travelled to the St. Thomas Elections offices and provided a falsified date within the parameters to meet the requirement, Fawkes wrote in an email to the party chairman.

The Supreme Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands issued an order allowing Yob and the others to vote, which in turn helped them get elected as uncommitted convention delegates.",[]
msnbc.com,,"Gulf Coast braces for torrential rains, 'life-threatening' floods",['Alastair Jamieson'],"Torrential rains and flash floods were expected to lash the Gulf Coast again on Friday amid a rash of severe weather that has killed at least five people across the South.

Flash-flood watches were in effect for much of Louisiana and parts of southern Arkansas and Texas, with up to 5 inches of rain expected across the region, the National Weather Service said.

This will result in additional significant and possibly life-threatening flooding, it warned. Flooding of rivers and lakes will be an ongoing threat for the next several days and likely into next week.

The severe weather battering the South already has forced thousands of people to flee their homes.

In Louisiana, local deputies and National Guard personnel made a number of dramatic rescues and helped evacuate flood-stricken residents.

More than 3,500 people have been evacuated so far and at least three people in the state have died, the governors spokeswoman Shauna Sanford told NBC News.

Up to 50 homes in Hammond, Louisiana, were flooded after the area received more than 10 inches of rain overnight, the NWS said. The deluge also washed away a highway bridge near New Orleans.

Statewide, at least 5,000 customers were without power as of 8 a.m. (9 a.m. ET), according to power firm Entergy.

So much rain has fallen along the Texas-Louisiana border that officials warned that the Sabine River could rise to a level not seen since 1884, The Weather Channel reported.

In Mississippi, Governor Phil Bryant declared a state of emergency in order to assist areas affected by the flooding.

Separately, heavy rain was forecast in parts of California  part of dangerous and deadly El Nino-fueled storms that caused localized flooding in areas left dry by the historic drought.

While the rain isnt expected to dangerous, forecasters are hopeful it could signal a turnaround from a dry February that was only exacerbated by the warmer, summer-like conditions.

msnbc.com,,New film revisits 1966 UT Austin massacre as school braces for 'campus carry' law,[],"On August 1, 1966, a tragedy that was unthinkable then but all too commonplace now occurred at the University of Texas in Austin. A deranged gunman named Charles Whitman opened fire on innocent people from the top of the schools iconic clock tower, killing 14 people and wounding dozens of others in what was for many years the worst mass shooting in US history.

Fifty years later, on that very same day, the victims of the massacre will be commemorated for the first time with an official memorial on campus. But that cathartic moment will also coincide with the start of a new law, pushed through the Texas state legislature by conservatives last June, which will allow students to carry concealed handguns on campus. The measure drew a strong rebuke from faculty and students, in addition to over 86,000 signatures on a petition that called it a direct assault on our free speech rights.

These events provide the context for TOWER, a powerful new documentary about the 1966 UT Austin shooting, which is debuting at SXSW this Sunday.

The generation that lived through the tower shooting has realized there was a missed opportunity there, the films director Keith Maitland, who is a Texas native and UT Austin alum, told MSNBC on Friday. He first learned of the massacre as seventh grader because his history teacher had been a witness. Her first-person perspective fascinated Maitland, who was later frustrated by mainstream preoccupation with Whitmans motivations and the universitys unwillingness at the time to engage with its darkest history. He saw this project as an opportunity to right that wrong.

When English professor Lisa Moore first came to UT Austin 24 years ago, the shadow of the Whitman shooting was very much still over the school. The upper deck of the tower remained closed for years, and although the institution had done little to acknowledge what had happened, it was prevalent in student and faculty minds.

The whole event was just buried, she told MSNBC on Friday. I think people were ashamed. I think they thought it made Texas look bad. The assumption was it was better not to talk about it; it would be better not to re-open old wounds.

But lawmakers insistence on backing pro-classroom carry legislation had the unintended effect of galvanizing gun control advocates on campus. While, according to Moore, some of her peers thought that the decision to have the new law go into effect on the anniversary of the 1966 massacre was shocking, others believed its not a coincidence, that they wanted to make a point that they can basically force this law on UT, and theres nothing you can do about it.

The reaction on campus was Are you kidding me? she said.

Ana Lopez, a 19-year-old pre-med freshman at UT, was stunned to learn about the campus carry law last fall and told MSNBC on Friday that had she been aware of it, she wouldnt have accepted admission to the school, even though the university had been her top choice.

I dont want to be in an unsafe situation where my life is at stake every day, she said. I do not feel safe on campus.

She is a member of Students Against Campus Carry and has petitioned hundreds of her classmates in opposition to the gun law. While there was a minority of students who declined to get involved and at least one who argued that he felt guns on campus made them safer, the overwhelming majority of students she spoke to were mortified about the consequences of campus carry. Lopez points out the potential dangers of armed college students drinking, and she believes as a Latina that some ethnic groups on campus could be at greater risk for violence as the law comes into effect.

My mom and dad are livid  they come with me to rallies, and they support me being an activist, Lopez said. But she is not naive about the depth of the opposition her side faces, acknowledging that she has had heated clashes with counter-protesters. And even though the legislative process has run its course, she sees real value in getting more students informed and involved, especially in light of the fact that similar laws are being promoted by pro-campus carry advocates around the country.

If we engage enough students, this is going to become a national issue, she said. If I have to walk around campus wearing a bulletproof vest to be able to speak my mind, thats what I am going to do.

She cites Moore, whom she studied world literature under, as one of her inspirations. Moore is an active member of Gun-Free UT, an alliance of students, faculty, alumni and parents dedicated to expressing the widespread dissent at the university against the campus carry law. Not a single department on campus has published a statement saying they are in favor [of it], said Moore. We are a university, we are persuaded by rational arguments and data.

Still, Moore is sympathetic to the concerns of proponents of the bill, especially parents anxious about sending their children to school in a potentially hostile urban setting. But the facts dont support the premise that civilians with guns are a successful crime deterrent or that supposed good guys with guns would be able to effectively disarm a mass shooter.

This is a dichotomy that TOWER makes abundantly clear. Most of Whitmans victims couldnt even see him, let alone confront him. Claire Wilson James, the first person wounded by Whitmans shots from the tower, was eight months pregnant. Should she have been carrying a gun? Her boyfriend Thomas Eckman, who was next to her at time, was shot and killed seconds after her. If he had been armed, would that have made a difference?

There is nothing they could have done to prevent getting shot, Maitland argued. And those police officers and civilians that did initially shoot back didnt have the vantage point to really connect with the killer. It is also unclear how much accidental collateral damage the nonstop barrage of return fire might have caused.

Those bullets had to fall somewhere, added Maitland.

In TOWER, Aleck Hernandez Jr., one of the people who was wounded that day, says, Maybe out of this movie, one potential shooter will have second thoughts.

Maitlands goal for the project is perhaps less ambitious, but no less important. I knew from the beginning we were not going to solve the problems of school shootings with this film, he said. The most important thing to me is that we start a dialogue and inspire conversation around this subject. And that smarter people than me enact some sort of path forward.

Its aimed squarely at high school and college students who live under the threat of the school shooting phenomenon every day, he added.

Meanwhile, although Moore has no way of preventing campus carry from going into effect, that wont stop her from engaging her students on the issue. Thats going to become a topic I teach on in every class, every semester, she said. Although Moore has received some pushback for her vocal opposition to the gun legislation, by and large she says the schools administration has been supportive of her activism. That has apparently not been the case statewide. On other campuses, peoples jobs have been threatened, she said.

She said she was recently approached by a younger member of the faculty who wanted to get involved in Gun-Free UT but has resisted because she was afraid of being a target. The professor, who has young children, told Moore that she doesnt know if she can return to the campus next fall and has begun seeing a therapist to grapple with the fear she has of a culture of guns permeating her workplace. Moore says that the professors therapist told her that its a commonly heard issue.

Moore herself is no stranger to threats. She teaches a class on LGBT literature and has had students register for her classes just to intimidate openly gay people. She has also seen her office broken into, her property damaged, her windows spray-painted with messages of hate. I definitely feel concerned for the safety of [the LGBT] population of students, she said. But nothing is going to stop her from taking a stand against the campus carry law. Weve made it water cooler conversation again ... Gun Free UT gives us a platform, she said. Our role is to amplify dissent.

As for Maitland, his journey with this material is just beginning. On August 1, he will be launching a new initiative in coordination with UTs official alumni organization, Texas Exes, called Beyond the Tower. Its an oral history and user-guided documentary that will encompass the perspectives of hundreds of survivors and witnesses to the 1966 shooting.

I want those people to feel heard, and I want those people to have an opportunity to engage in a personal way with their own history, Maitland said. Those who ignore their history are bound to repeat it.",[]
msnbc.com,,New film revisits 1966 UT Austin massacre as school braces for 'campus carry' law,[],"On August 1, 1966, a tragedy that was unthinkable then but all too commonplace now occurred at the University of Texas in Austin. A deranged gunman named Charles Whitman opened fire on innocent people from the top of the schools iconic clock tower, killing 14 people and wounding dozens of others in what was for many years the worst mass shooting in US history.

Fifty years later, on that very same day, the victims of the massacre will be commemorated for the first time with an official memorial on campus. But that cathartic moment will also coincide with the start of a new law, pushed through the Texas state legislature by conservatives last June, which will allow students to carry concealed handguns on campus. The measure drew a strong rebuke from faculty and students, in addition to over 86,000 signatures on a petition that called it a direct assault on our free speech rights.

These events provide the context for TOWER, a powerful new documentary about the 1966 UT Austin shooting, which is debuting at SXSW this Sunday. The film, which uses state-of-the-art rotoscoping animation to recreate the chilling events of that day and features real-life interviews with the survivors, is poised to re-open conversations about our countrys propensity for gun violence and how the people affected by it most process their experiences.

msnbc.com,,Rubio 'releasing' Ohio supporters in effort to stop Trump,"['Gabe Gutierrez', 'Alex Jaffe']","WEST PALM BEACH, Florida  Facing a nearly insurmountable delegate deficit and the threat of Donald Trump possibly running away with the Republican presidential nomination if the billionaire wins the Florida and Ohio primaries next week, Sen. Marco Rubios campaign acknowledged Friday that Ohio voters who oppose Trump should vote for Gov. John Kasich.

At a news conference with Jewish leaders, Rubio stopped short of asking his Ohio supporters to vote for the governor.

Ill leave it to John to make that argument, he said.

view photo essay The presidential campaign: Marco Rubio Because of his youth and relatively moderate campaign rhetoric, Rubio is often touted as the Republican Partys best hope of appealing to younger voters.

But a senior adviser told NBC News that Rubios campaign is essentially releasing his Ohio voters to Kasich. The adviser said if Rubio wins Florida and Kasich wins Ohio, itll be a whole new day.

Such a scenario would prevent Trump from taking two of the biggest delegate pots next Tuesday, when a number of states voting award all of their delegates to the primary winner, and help slow his march to the nomination. It would also help ensure the primary fight heads to a brokered convention, which both Kasich and Rubios campaigns have acknowledged are their only remaining path to the nomination.

Most polls of Ohio have shown Kasich with a slight lead over GOP front-runner Trump, while Rubio lags Trump in polls of Florida by anywhere from 6 to 23 percentage points.

While a win for both Kasich and Rubio in their respective home states would shake up the race, if Rubio loses Florida, Itll be a dark day, his adviser said.

Rubio himself wouldnt speculate about what would happen Tuesday if he fails to overtake Trump.

I havent thought about anything beyond Tuesday night, Rubio told NBC News in an interview inside his campaign bus. But were going to win Tuesday night, so I wont have that decision to make.

Rubio insists theres been no formal discussion with the Kasich campaign  and he dismissed any notion of a so-called unity ticket with either Kasich or his other rival, Sen. Ted Cruz.

This is stuff from, like, House of Cards, he said. Thats not real life.

WATCH: Rubio flailing in new Florida poll

Its also possible the Rubio campaign could be trying manage expectations for whats expected to be a disappointing finish in Ohio, Kasichs home state where polls suggests hes locked in a tight battle with Trump.

Rubio has been fending off threats from Cruz and Kasich in his home state.

We agree with the Rubio campaign that the best chance to beat Donald Trump in Ohio is by voting for John Kasich, and in that spirit, Sen. Rubio should immediately tell his Super PAC to stop attacking the governor, said Chris Schrimpf, a Kasich spokesman.

Conservative Solutions PAC, the Super PAC supporting Marco Rubio, is airing advertising in Florida and Illinois attacking Kasich, but those ads are not airing in Ohio.

But the Kasich team is already fundraising based on the Rubio campaigns suggestion today that voters who oppose Trump vote for him in Ohio.

Have a lot of faith voters in Florida & Ohio know the need to stop Trump and will do the right thing.  John Weaver (@JWGOP) March 11, 2016

Last week in Detroit, Kasich was asked about this possibility and whether he would encourage his own supporters in Florida to vote for Rubio to get everyone closer to a contested convention.

What kind of a question is that? A good question. A tricky question, Kasich mused. I think it is important we stop Mr. Trump. He is not my pick for president and you know I want to have a more positive approach to the solutions of the country, so lets see where things go down the road here. Let me just put it to you this way: I am going to spend a lot of time in Ohio, and I bet Mr. Rubio is going to spend a lot of time in Florida.",[]

Now, these are not separate issues. They are the same issue. If Republican senators want to stand up to extremists running for president, they can start right now by standing up to extremists in the Senate. They can start by doing what they were elected to do right here in the Senate. They can start by doing their jobs.

Former First Lady Nancy Reagans funeral service was held today in California, and as part of the coverage of the event, Hillary Clinton spoke to MSNBCs Andrea Mitchell about Nancy Reagans legacy. Most of the interview was largely what one would expect, but Clinton shared a thought that has quickly become problematic.

It may be hard for your viewers to remember how difficult it was for people to talk about HIV/AIDS back in the 1980s. And because of both President and Mrs. Reagan  in particular, Mrs. Reagan  we started national conversation when before no one would talk about it, no one wanted to do anything about it, and that too is something that I really appreciate, with her very effective, low-key advocacy, but it penetrated the public conscience and people began to say Hey, we have to do something about this too.

Well, I guess national conversation might be true in some sense, since a whole lot of Americans were saying in the 1980s, I cant believe how offensive the Reagan administrations callous indifference to the HIV/AIDS crisis really is.

But Clinton seemed to be suggesting something altogether different  as if Nancy Reagan was somehow deserving of genuine praise.

Saying something nice about a prominent public figure during a funeral service makes sense, but saying something nice about the Reagans record on HIV/AIDS does not.

Voxs report notes that among people in the Reagan administration, Nancy Reagan was arguably one of the less offensive figures.

What does seem to be true is that when the Reagan administration eventually did decide to respond to the AIDS crisis, Nancy Reagan was among the influential administration figures pushing for that decision. I think that she deserves credit for opening up the AIDS money, historian Allida Black told PBS in 2011, saying that along with [Dr. C. Everett Koop, Reagans surgeon general], the first lady pressed the president and the secretary of health and human services to allocate research funding to HIV/AIDS issues. But, Black continued, I could never say that without saying they never would have waited this long if not for the perception that the disease was a problem for gay men. In the same PBS segment, Nancys son, Ron Reagan, likewise portrays his mother as an important progressive force on AIDS issues inside the Reagan administration.

The problem, of course, is the idea of grading on a curve. The Reagan White Houses approach to HIV/AIDS was scandalously offensive  both at the time and in hindsight  so the fact that Nancy Reagan eventually took some small-but-constructive steps only looks decent by way of an ugly comparison.",[]

There were no campaign stops in the sleepy southern Mississippi town of Pearlington this primary season.

At last count in 2010, there were just 274 registered Democrats, 185 Republicans and 315 independents living in the town of 1,600.

Nearly three-quarters of the population is white and the other quarter is black. One out of every four residents lives in poverty.

I cover the campaign of Ted Cruz, which doesnt have a charter plane or a bus for the press.

It can be frustrating driving seven hours attempting to track down a candidate by car as his plane flies overhead. But in recent weeks, Ive found the drive through parts of America to be humbling and as important as anything I hear in a stump speech.

We need help, said Melody Roberts, a resident of Pearlington, when I asked her what she would like a presidential candidate to understand about her town.

The Gulf Coast was torn up so bad theyve only focused on New Orleans, Roberts deplored to me earlier this week, standing inside a gymnasium built to headquarter much of the rebuilding efforts in the town obliterated by Hurricane Katrina.

Her friend, Susie Sharp, a quick-tongued, longtime resident, said the response for the past decade has been as if the hurricane only hit New Orleans.

Its bullshit, she said.

Roberts jumped back in, explaining that New Orleans got the floods, but they did not get the wind and the storm. This was the eye of the storm.

And it was. Winds, along with waters coming off the Gulf Coast more than 20 feet high, nearly eliminated Pearlington, which has been dubbed Katrinas Forgotten Town.

Almost eleven years later, many of the homes are rebuilt. But its just the start to rebuilding the community.

This is nothing but pencils piled up to the top, Sharp said, walking us through a storage closet with bins stacked of school supplies. Then thats notebooks, binders, folders, spiral notebooks, everything  glue sticks, you name it.

Sharp volunteers with Roberts for the Pearlington Impact Association, a non-profit about a dozen community members run.

It provides the approximately 300 children in town their school supplies before each school year. It gathers clothes for the kids, helps take free photos of them each Christmas for their families and hosts a trunk-or-treat for the kids on Halloween, when locals park their cars in the library parking lot and pass out candy from the trunks of their cars.

Several years after the hurricane hit, the local schools shuttered. Roberts and Sharp said the children are now at their bus stops by 6 a.m., and theyre the last ones to get home from the schools now 20 to 30 miles away.

The pair also vented about the severe flooding each time a storm rolls through  something they say never happened until the levees around New Orleans were constructed, pushing the water onto land in parts of Southern Mississippi.

Sharp, just last semester, had floodwaters rise four feet into her home. She said she no longer has savings after the years of expenses.

I asked them who in the government they turn to for help or to hear their concerns.

We have no local level, Sharp responded. Our governor is in Jackson, Mississippi.

Jackson  the state capital  is three hours north. There is no mayor or city council of Pearlington. And the county supervisor representing the town lives outside of town.

And truthfully, if it werent for my four-hour drive between stops to cover Ted Cruz campaign events, I wouldnt have heard the voices of Pearlington either.

msnbc.com,,Tales from the trail: Voices of a Mississippi town still reeling from Katrina,['Vaughn Hillyard'],"Want to know what the NBC News Embeds saw? Follow their daily journey to the inside of the 2016 presidential campaign here:

There were no campaign stops in the sleepy southern Mississippi town of Pearlington this primary season.

At last count in 2010, there were just 274 registered Democrats, 185 Republicans and 315 independents living in the town of 1,600.

Nearly three-quarters of the population is white and the other quarter is black. One out of every four residents lives in poverty.

I cover the campaign of Ted Cruz, which doesnt have a charter plane or a bus for the press.

It can be frustrating driving seven hours attempting to track down a candidate by car as his plane flies overhead. But in recent weeks, Ive found the drive through parts of America to be humbling and as important as anything I hear in a stump speech.

msnbc.com,,Clinton: I 'misspoke' about Nancy Reagan and AIDS advocacy,[],"Hillary Clinton has apologized after saying that Nancy Reagan used very effective low-key advocacy to start a national conversation about the HIV/AIDS epidemic during her time in the White House.

Hillary Clinton has apologized after saying that Nancy Reagan used very effective low-key advocacy to start a national conversation about the HIV/AIDS epidemic during her time in the White House.

In a tweet, Clinton said she misspoke about the Reagans legacy on the issue, telling followers For that, Im sorry.

Hillary Clintons statement on her comments about the Reagans record on HIV and AIDS: pic.twitter.com/RtIs0zpJfk  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 11, 2016

Gay rights activists immediately questioned Clinton after she told NBCs Andrea Mitchell Friday that the Reagans started a national conversation about the disease.

Human Rights Campaign head Chad Griffin said that Mrs. Reagan, who died over the weekend, was no hero when it came to victims of a disease that was notably ignored by the White House for most of Reagans presidency and linked by many of those around him to the immorality of gay men.

While I respect her advocacy on issues like stem cell & Parkinsons research, Nancy Reagan was, sadly, no hero in the fight against HIV/AIDS  Chad Griffin (@ChadHGriffin) March 11, 2016

Clinton told NBC earlier Friday that Nancy Reagan helped push the crisis into the publics attention.

It may be hard for your viewers to remember how difficult it was for people to talk about HIV/AIDS back in the 1980s. And because of both President and Mrs. Reagan, in particular Mrs. Reagan, we started a national conversation, when before nobody would talk about it, she said.Nobody wanted to do anything about it.

And, you know, that too is something that I really appreciate with her very effective low-key advocacy, but it penetrated the public conscience and people began to say, hey, we have to do something about this too, she added.

Mrs. Reagans funeral was held Friday in Simi Valley, California.

msnbc.com,,GOP candidates accuse Donald Trump of encouraging violence at rallies,[],"Republican candidates condemned Donald Trump for fanning the flames of of violence at his rallies on Friday, taking a more forceful tack after declining to criticize him over the issue in Thursdays debate.

The story reached a terrifying pitch on Friday night, as protesters forced Trump to cancel a Chicago rally as scuffles broke out at the venue and in the streets outside.

RELATED: Trump rally in Chicago postponed after clashes

I think a campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment, Texas Senator Ted Cruz told reporters in Illinois Friday night, as networks beamed in live footage of the protests. When a candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence, to punch people in the face, the predictable consequence of that is that it escalates, and today is unlikely to be the last such instance.

Earlier in the day Friday, Florida Senator Marco Rubio strongly condemned Trump, saying there were consequences  to his words.

view photo essay Standing up against Donald Trump At Trump rallies, people of all ages and creeds, even some outside the continent, have continued to make their voices heard.

I would point out there isnt violence at my events, there isnt violence at Teds events, there isnt violence at a Kasich event, there isnt violence at a Sanders event, there isnt violence at a Clinton event, he told reporters. Theres only one presidential candidate who has violence at their events.

After the Chicago rally, however, Rubio sounded more torn between condemning Trumps behavior and his horror at the rowdy protesters massing in the streets.

I want to be clear: I am not telling you what happened there tonight is something I blame [Trump] for because I will tell you those people there are professional protesters in an array of different interest groups, Rubio told Fox News. I guarantee you some of these people are being paid to do this.

He added that theres blame to go around in creating todays heated political environment around Trump, and singled out Obama.

President Obama has spent the last eight years dividing Americans among haves and have-nots, along ethnic lines, racial lines, gender lines in order to win elections, Rubio said. I think this has gone to the next level here, and were seeing the consequences of it.

Ohio Governor John Kasich, initially declined to criticize Trump over his rallies Friday evening, saying he had never been to one. But his campaign issued a statement later that night condemning Trumps role in the chaotic Chicago rally while urging protesters to remain peaceful.

Tonight the seeds of division that Donald Trump has been sowing this whole campaign finally bore fruit, and it was ugly, Kasich said. Some let their opposition to his views slip beyond protest into violence, but we can never let that happen. I urge people to resist that temptation and rise to a higher level.

Fridays standoff occurred after a Trump supporter was arrested earlier in the week for sucker punching a protester on camera, and Trumps campaign manager Corey Lewandoski was accused of aggressively grabbing Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields when she approached Trump with a question. She has filed a criminal complaint and video of the incident appears to show Lewandoski moving toward her, but the Trump campaign denies the claim.

Trump said at a February rally in Las Vegas hed like to punch [a protester] in the face and has frequently alluded to violence in response to the typically peaceful activists who often interrupt his rallies.

If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, he said at a separate February rally in Iowa. Just knock the hell out of them. I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees.

Asked by MSNBC in an interview on Friday night about the Chicago event, Trump said he cancelled the rally because he didnt want to see anybody get hurt.

There is a lot of anger in the country and its very sad to see, he said.

On CNN, however, Trump made clear he didnt believe his rhetoric contributed to the danger.

More than 160,000 Fukushima residents fled their homes in the wake of the disaster, and the effects of the seaside towns now leveled, the schools still shuttered, the once-famous destinations all but vacant, and the nearly 19,000 lives lost weigh heavily on survivors.

Almost half of the 94 municipalities in Fukushima have yet to complete decontamination, and nearly 100,000 residents are still displaced as depopulation rates continue to accelerate despite the fact that the regions, and the countrys, road to recovery lies in a return to these areas.

Everyone, get your tickets to this. Were all going in!!!! #SHUTITDOWN, he posted on Facebook last week.

Little did he know they actually would shut it down.

Friday night, hundreds of protesters invaded Trumps rally while thousands more marched outside, leading the candidate to abruptly cancel the event due to safety concerns. The night spun out from there, as angry Trump fans clashed with protesters, who saw the shutdown as a victory.

RELATED: GOP candidates accuse Donald Trump of encouraging violence at rallies

Protesters interrupt virtually every Trump speech. But what made Chicago different were its scale and the organization behind the effort. Hundreds of young, largely black and brown people poured in from across the city, taking over whole sections of the arena and bracing for trouble.

And as the repeated chants of Ber-nie demonstrated, it was largely organized by supporters of Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate who has struggled to win over black voters, but whose revolutionary streak has excited radicals of all colors.

Remember the #TrumpRally wasnt just luck. It took organizers from dozens of organizations and thousands of people to pull off. Great work, tweeted People for Bernie, a large unofficial pro-Sanders organization founded by veterans of the Occupy movement and other lefty activists.

Sanders campaign was not involved with the protest, but some felt encouraged by the showing. If the candidate doesnt win the Democratic presidential nomination, the anti-Trump showing in Chicago foreshadows a possible future avenue for his movement in the general election, in which Trump is the most likely Republican nominee.

Friday night happened, according to various activists involved, thanks to a confluence of events.

The pump was primed in Chicago, thanks to now near-constant demonstrations against Mayor Rahm Emanuel over the shooting of Laquan McDonald and other issues. Trump chose a venue, the University of Illinois Chicago campus, in the heart of the city, where student organizers whipped a demonstration together. And activists tapped into existing networks of pro-Bernie Sanders and Black Lives Matter activists.

We wanted to show Trump that this is Chicago, and we run Chicago, and were not going to take this, said Green. We got better organizers here.

Rumors about Trumps visit started flying around the UIC campus Friday evening. Students were not happy.

On Monday night, there was a meeting. The lecture hall, meant to hold 100 students, overflowed with representatives of student groups from the Black Student Union to Fearless and Undocumented. They decided they would march outside the rally to protest.

Hes marginalized and dehumanized a lot of different groups, and they all come together, said Juan Rojas, one of the student organizers.

A Facebook page was started to promote the protest. By the night of Trump rally, more than 11,600 people had RSVPd on the page saying they would attend the event. Another 19,000 said they were interested. Organizers were shocked when Facebooks analytics said the page reached more than 1.5 million users.

Jorge Mena, a undocumented graduate student at UIC, started a petition on MoveOn.org calling on the schools administration to cancel the event. The petition garnered more than 50,000 signatures, and once brass at MoveOn, which has endorsed Sanders, caught wind of the UIC backlash, they wanted to help. MoveOn chipped in money to get signs and a banner printed and blasted out an email to members in the Chicago area encouraging them to join the protest.

With just four days to plan, organizers said more than 1,000 students turned out for the march, along with thousands of community members.

Meanwhile, on the night of the Trump rally, organizers who planned to disrupt the event from inside had designated multiple rallying points around the venue to avoid arousing suspicion of authorities with large congregations. Some met at the Papa Johns, others at the Quad.

As activists slipped into the lines, they were told to blend in with the crowd and act natural.

Inside, about 100 protesters received coveted orange wristbands allowing them access to the floor. Even as organizers tried to maintain calm, some scuffles with Trump fans started right away, and police began removing people. Secret Service agents recognized Green and pulled him outside, he said, but he quickly changed into a friends hoodie and slid back in.

The plan was to wait until Trump took the stage, then wait for the applause to die down and have all the protesters erupt at once. But they never made it that far. Instead of Trump, an official announced the event was canceled.

At that point, we just went crazy, said Green.

Jedidiah Brown, another organizer, rushed the stage to rip up a Trump sign before being removed. He was put in a headlock by a Trump supporter and had a water bottle thrown at his head.

It became a Bernie Sanders rally, he said. Hundreds of supporters chanted Sanders name, and some carried signs for the senator. Brown guessed the vast majority of the diverse protesters were Sanders supporters.

Matthew Ross, who created several event pages promoting the protest, said the activism around McDonald played directly into the event. That kind of just carried over to this, he said.

Well just keep a lookout and see if [Trump] tries to come back to Chicago, Ross said. Hopefully, theres a domino effect.",[]
msnbc.com,,"In hard-hit Ohio steel town, Trump and Sanders resonate",['Leigh Ann Caldwell'],"LORAIN, Ohio  The landscape here looks like a wasteland. And its about to get worse.

Two steel mills in this city, 30 miles west of Cleveland on Lake Erie, are set to close by the end of March, laying off hundreds of people in an area that has seen jobs slowly erode for more than two decades.

The final 130 workers at Republic Steel will be out of work when the plant rolls its final order of steel tubular products for oil drilling and fracking equipment in two weeks. And at U.S. Steel, the final 200 workers will also be out of jobs at the end of March.

Its a sad month, said Brian Sealy, a union official for the United Steelworkers in Lorain. Overall the trickle-down effect on this community - the closed-up downtown - continues. That trickle-down effect is devastating to a community like this.

Downtown Lorain is dotted with boarded businesses and deteriorating buildings while dollar stores and run-down used car lots fill in the gaps. The downtown is mostly empty, hosting building after building of blight and despair.

RELATED: Why trade matters in the Rust Belt

Its a much different scenario than 30 years ago in the 1980s when the steel mills, the largest employers in town, were busy and employed more than 10,000 people.

Now the town of 64,000 people is facing a deficit of more than $2 million dollars in large part because of the loss of tax revenue from steel workers.

Union workers blame trade deals, especially the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, passed in 1993. And with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, another trade deal with Asian countries, on the verge of passing, Sealy said the future looks blight.

Theres going to be a lot more offshoring of jobs and thats going to affect us directly, Sealy said.

The closing of the steel mills and the looming threat of TPP are coming to the fore while a contentious presidential primary is heading straight to Lorain as Ohio holds its primary Tuesday.

In this traditionally Democratic stronghold, Donald Trump is working for those voters who feel that their livelihood is in jeopardy.

The county of Lorain backed President Barack Obama in 2008 with 58 percent and 56 percent in 2012.

But not only is Donald Trump the only Republican candidate to open an office there, hes the only candidate in both parties to invest resources by paying staff to be here. His office opened on February 29.

Residents of Lorain reflect the profile of the Trump voter.

For instance, in Michigan, a state Trump won, 54 percent of voters said trade takes jobs away from Americans. Of those, nearly half - 42 percent - voted for Trump.

Trump is also appealing to the voter that identifies as independent. Also in Michigan, 37 percent of self-identified independents backed Trump and in Georgia and 40 percent in Minnesota.

David Moore, a volunteer for Trump in Lorain County, said hes not surprised that workers in the heavily Democratic county would back Trump.

Right now NAFTA has really screwed with this area, and hes talking about NAFTA, Moore said. Thats what these people want to hear. Hes talking about jobs. Its all about jobs.

He thought rundown downtown Lorain was the perfect place to set up shop.

That kind of shows - lets go back to NAFTA  when jobs leave this is what happens to downtown, Moore said. It kinda shows whats going on in our area.

During nearly every campaign speech, Trump is critical of trade deals. Its a position counter to that of traditional Republicans who support free trade.

China has taken millions of jobs, thousands of factories. What theyve done to us, its actually, I thought about it the other day, its the greatest theft in the history of the world, Trump said after his win in Michigan Tuesday.

He added: You take a look at, as an example, in Chicago where you have Nabisco moves its big plant  theyre closing their plant. Theyre moving to Mexico. Ford, building a $2 1/2 billion factory, cars, in Mexico. I mean, we cant continue to do it.

Trump doesnt sound much different than a union worker.

Politicians have to wake up and see the devastation, Sealy said. Whether its a bad trade agreement or like companies going offshore like Nabisco in Chicago. ... Its hard to believe the government doesnt see this.

Sealy is not a Trump supporters and his union is likely to back a Democrat when and if it does endorse. But Sealy admits, I do understand his appeal.

Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO, also admitted that Trump has struck a nerve, even with Democratic voters. But Trumka told NBC News that his federation will be educating their members about each candidates record, including that Trump, he says, is not friend to workers. He points to his efforts to block efforts to unionize at his own property in Las Vegas.

Ohio will be a big trade state so his clear position on trade will help him there, but when you give the members the full facts, Trumka said, I think youre going to see more and more people shying away from him.

Trump will be competing against three other Republicans, including Ohio gov. John Kasich, who are much more supportive of free trade deals than Trump.

Sanders, meanwhile, also has a presence in this working-class enclave of northeast Ohio. He, too, deplores the trade deals and often criticizes his opponent Hillary Clinton for her husbands role in passing NAFTA and her support of TPP until she came out against it during her presidential campaign.

Sanders campaign office, however, is volunteer-run and -funded. Alan Pugh, who has never participated in politics before, opened the office in downtown Elyria. He and fellow volunteers pay for the rent and all the utilities out of their own coffers.

Having Bernie and Donald trump both having offices down here speaks to an anti-establishment mentality so the end of establishment politics and economics. People are looking for something a little different than theyve experienced in the past 30 years, Pugh said.

Sealy is living it.

Were struggling everywhere right now. To us its a crisis.

Look, its all ... its negative and its desperation. But the people of this state, they know me and so Im not  Im not concerned about it.

Kasich was speaking at a wide-ranging MSNBC town hall with Willie Geist and a crowd of constituents at Lima Pallet Company in his home state, where he addressed questions from social security to ISIS to higher education to guns.

Kasich laughed off a statement from Geist that Trump has previously suggested Kasich would be a good vice president.

Hed better not say that in front of my wife, Kasich quipped, adding Im serious.

Kasich gave his standard answer to the vice president question, stating: First of all, I believe Ill be the nominee. I have the second best job in America. Number one is president. Number two is governor of Ohio. And I love being governor of Ohio.

When pressed on whether he would accept Trumps vice presidential nomination if offered, Kasich avoided a direct answer, saying, Im going to be the Republican nominee after we win Ohio and finish the rest of the country.

Earlier Friday, news broke that the Rubio campaign would be okay withreleasing their supporters in Ohio to vote for Kasich, since Kasich has a better chance at beating Trump in the winner-take-all state on Tuesday, therefore preventing Trump from gathering more delegates to get closer to clinching the nomination. But Kasich did not reciprocate the offering for his supporters in Florida.

Should I tell my voters to not vote for me? Kasich asked. I should tell my voters, dont vote for me, go vote for somebody else?

Well thats what the Rubio campaign suggested, Geist responded.

Kasich has repeatedly acknowledged that a victory for him in Ohio could lead to a contested Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer, often adding how such a scenario could result in an educational opportunity for students. But at the MSNBC town hall, he maintained that he could absolutely win enough and go into the convention with the greatest number of delegates. That absolutely can happen.

I think its very hard for anybody to get there with the right number of delegates to clinch the nomination, Kasich added. But you know, you get there and you have the delegates there and they take a look at whos running and whos in the arena and then they make a pick. But I could go in there stronger than anybody else. Thats not inconceivable.

Kasich returns to Ohio touting his strong record on job creation in the state, but he was asked about a few steel plants that are scheduled to close in Lorain, Ohio at the end of the month.

First of all, you have to rush in there and find out what you can train them for, Kasich responded. But were up in Ohio 63,000 manufacturing jobs since Ive come into office. Kasich blamed part of the situation on a violation of trade agreements - If Im president were not going to put up with that nonsense anymore. Were going to have an expedited process. When we see a violation of these trade agreements, were going to act on them immediately, he said.

I think people have a right under the Second Amendment to collect guns, to hunt.

I just dont believe that passing laws to restrict guns is going to have any impact, he continued. I think it is fundamentally a problem with the people who engage in this kind of violence.

Rubios comments follow a night of unrest in Chicago after protesters caused enough chaos at a Trump rally planned at the University of Illinois-Chicago that Trump decided to cancel the event. The rally disbanded onto the streets of the Windy City, where protesters and supporters clashed with police.

Five people were arrested and two officers were injured.

All three of the remaining GOP presidential contenders  Rubio, Ted Cruz and, in a statement, Ohio Gov. John Kasich  decried Trumps refusal to denounce the violence thats broken out in recent weeks at his rallies.

I think a campaign bears responsibility for creating an environment, Cruz said in Illinois on Friday night. When a candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence, to punch people in the face, the predictable consequence of that is that it escalates, and today is unlikely to be the last such instance.

Kasich also called Trump out Friday night.

Tonight the seeds of division that Donald Trump has been sowing this whole campaign finally bore fruit, and it was ugly, he said. Some let their opposition to his views slip beyond protest into violence, but we can never let that happen. I urge people to resist that temptation and rise to a higher level.

The skirmishes Friday happened after a Trump supporter was arrested earlier in the week for punching a protester on camera, and Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandoski was accused of yanking Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields when she came up to Trump to ask a question. Fields has filed a criminal complaint.

This is what a culture and a society looks like when everyone goes around saying whatever the heck they want, Rubio said Saturday. The result is, it all breaks down. Its called chaos. Its called anarchy. And thats what were careening towards.

Asked just minutes earlier by reporters whether hed continue to support Trump  who still maintains a significant lead in most public polls for the GOP primary  he said: I still at this moment continue to intend to support the Republican nominee.

But, he added, Its getting harder every day.

Five people were arrested and two officers were injured during the ugly skirmishes, Chicago police said. One of the injured officers was struck by a bottle and suffered a bloody gash that will require stitches, police said.

The scenes were criticized by Trumps rivals, who said responsibility for the rancor lay with the candidate.

But Trump tweeted with characteristic defiance early Saturday, saying: The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America!

Punches were seen being thrown inside the University of Illinois-Chicago Pavilion Friday night. Demonstrators held up anti-Trump signs and tussled with supporters before the crowd was eventually told that the event was postponed.

The Chicago Police Department said that it was notified at 6:30 p.m. that the Trump campaign had cancelled their scheduled event. Police said the department played no role in the event being called off and had adequate security.

Some in the crowd were heard yelling We did it! We did it! after the rally was called off for the evening. There were clashes inside the venue and a large group was seen fighting outside.

It is unfortunate that parties on both sides allowed their political views to become confrontational and thats unfortunately resulted in the scuffling that occurred inside the pavilion and those arrests that were made, police Interim Superintendent John Escalante said late Friday.

Trump told MSNBC in a telephone interview: I just dont want to see people hurt ... We can come back and do it another time. He said he felt the decision was the right thing to do under the circumstances.

He said there was do much anger at the rally, adding: I dont think its directed at me , its just something thats been going on for years.

Jedidiah Brown, an activist and Sanders supporter, was dragged from the stage by security after tearing up a Trump poster.

He added: Trumps message, Trumps campaign is not welcome in Chicago.

Carly Fiorina, who dropped out of the race to endorse Ted Cruz, agreed with Trump that organized groups had set out to disrupt the rally but said the candidate should take responsibility.

Tone is set at the top, she told TODAY early Saturday.

Dannielle Villarreal and other protesters unfurled a banner that read Trump = Hate and which featured a Nazi swastika. She said they were there to protest Trumps fascist language, and that members of the crowd confronted them.

Questions have been raised in recent days after a man at a Trump rally sucker-punched a protester leaving an event in North Carolina, and after a Breitbart reporter accused Trumps campaign manager grabbing her hard enough to cause a bruise. The campaign manager has denied the claim.

Earlier Friday at a rally in St. Louis, Trump was repeatedly interrupted by protesters. A total of 32 people were arrested at the event at the Peabody Opera House, police said.

Trumps rivals criticized Trumps rhetoric and language as predictably leading to violence. Marco Rubio pointed to instances where Trump has said he wanted to punch a protester and made similar comments.

msnbc.com,,Why trade matters in the Rust Belt,[],"CLEVELAND, Ohio  Chuck Dennison sees whole cities destroyed in Ohio, and he blames free trade agreements.

My job did not become obsolete. My job did not get overtaken by robots. My job still exists. It just does not exist in the United States of America, he said.

Dennison grew up in a suburb of Dayton and became the fourth generation in his family to work at General Motors  before the company closed the plant and moved the line to Mexico after Bill Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993.

I dont think the American people really grasp, when they hear free trade and jobs being sent overseas, what kind of ripple effect that has not only on the American workers, but also on the community they left behind, Dennison said.

Deindustrialization defines the landscape here, from shuttered factories and steel mills to the dilapidated houses in neighborhoods that residents fled for greener economic pastures. Cleveland gave America its coffeemakers and vacuum cleaners, but now China and Mexico do. And deindustrialization defines the politics here, too.

Free trade agreements like NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)  the massive new trade deal with a dozen Pacific countries currently pending approval  make it easier for countries to move goods and operations across state lines. But while many economists say such deals benefit the economy as a whole, they can have hugely disruptive effects on communities and workers.

Anger at trade is not new, but in the past, mainstream presidential candidates of both parties always adopted more tempered criticism.

Now, in a year defined by anti-establishment populism, outsiders Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump have made free trade a paramount symbol of how they say elites and on-the-take politicians sell out the middle class.

Trade is a placeholder for economic anxiety, said Andy Stern, the former president of the Service Employees International Union. It matters, but what matters more is that its a placeholder for working families who think theyve been taken advantage of by the economy and politicians.

Both Trump and Sanders are running against the system that produced free trade. Hillary Clinton is running to continue the Obama status quo. On the Republican side, only Ohio Gov. John Kasich is running a similar message, explicitly defending free trade agreements.

RELATED: How Bernie Sanders hopes to pull a Michigan in Ohio

Whatever aggregate economic benefits trade produces, its deeply unpopular on the ground in places like Ohio, where manufacturing jobs have been lost. Paul Krugman, the liberal economist who supports free trade and has been friendly to Clinton in his columns, wrote Friday that the elite case for ever-freer trade is largely a scam.

Sanders scored an upset victory in Michigan earlier this week after spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on TV ads highlighting his long opposition to what he calls disastrous trade policy.

About six out of 10 voters said trade costs America more jobs than it creates, according to exit polls, and those who did favored Sanders by 15 points. Of the 30 percent who said trade creates jobs, most favored Clinton. The 37 percent of voters who said they were very worried about the economy broke strongly for Sanders, 58-40, while those only somewhat or not too worried went for Clinton.

Voters rejection of bad trade deals like TPP is the resounding fact through the primary process. It crosses party lines, candidates, geography, age, race and gender, said Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, which opposes most trade deals.

Now Sanders hopes he can repeat what he did in Michigan in Ohio, Illinois, Missouri and even North Carolina, where the textile and furniture industries have been hurt.

Ohio has lost 307,000 manufacturing jobs since 1994. Illinois has lost 290,822; Missouri, 105,798; and North Carolina, 359,794, according to Department of Labor data compiled by the anti-free trade group Public Citizen.

The focus on this issue puts Clinton in awkward position. On paper, Clinton and Sanders have more or less the same policy on trade: They oppose TPP and want to renegotiate NAFTA. As a New York senator, Clinton voted against the most meaningful trade agreement that came before her, the Central American Free Trade Agreement.

But Stern, who is not backing either candidate, notes its a tougher sell for Clinton, since her husband supported NAFTA and President Obama, her former boss, is pushing TPP. Clinton called TPP a gold standard trade deal when she was secretary of state.

On trade, voters might believe Clinton, but they believe Bernie a lot more, Stern said.

Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan represents Youngstown, Ohio, which has been particularly hard hit by the decline in manufacturing jobs, but hes backing Clinton along with Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, perhaps the toughest critic of free trade in the Senate.

NAFTA is like the logo for economic inequality, deindustrialization and lack of economic investment in the United States, Ryan said in an interview.

But railing against against the agreement wont actually solve the problem, Ryan said, and only Clinton is doing the hard, nuanced and admittedly less enthralling work of trying to put together complex public policy solutions to fix the economy. And trade is hardly the only or necessarily biggest driver of economic calamity, with technology playing an enormous role, as well.

Ive been here 14 years  I dont really want to have another discussion about how bad NAFTA was, Ryan said. I want to have a discussion about how we grow our economy.

Sanders has spent years building an overarching message that the political establishment elites have sold out working families. Clinton, as Sanders sees it, is emblematic of that establishment.

Its not just trade policy that separates the two Democratic rivals. Larry Cohen, the former president of the Communication Workers of America union who now does labor outreach for Sanders, said the Vermont senators relatively modest life puts him in closer touch with the concerns of average voters.

We have a candidate here that is much more authentic in terms of working-class life. He lives in a house like a teacher would live in in Burlington, Vermont. He doesnt live in a mansion, and he doesnt have a second mansion in Washington, Cohen said.



If Clinton authentically opposed TPP, Cohen argued, she could have stopped it by coming out against fast-track before Congress voted, which hes convinced would have lead to its defeat.

Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook rejected criticism of Clintons trade record in a conference call with reporters this week. But Mook acknowledged the campaign has to work even harder to amplify her economic arguments.

Proponents of free trade note that it was none other than Franklin Delano Roosevelt, perhaps the Democratic Partys most revered former president, who more or less invented the liberal trade regime as a guarantor of stability and prosperity after World War II.

Bill Clinton, running in a very different political climate in 1992 than his wife faces today, embraced free trade in a controversial move. In October of that year, just weeks out from Election Day, and despite intense opposition from the left wing of the party and labor unions, Clinton decided to come out for NAFTA.

The unenviable task of informing Michigan Democrats of Bill Clintons decision fell to his aides Simon Rosenberg and Stan Greenberg. On a conference call with dozens of elected officials and union leaders, the news dropped like a bomb. There was a long pause, and then things got heated. The opposition was fierce.

It was a rough and difficult call and the beginning of a very rough period, Rosenberg recalled, but we still won Michigan.

In 2008, Hillary Clinton and Obama were critical of NAFTA, but nowhere near as strident as Sanders is now. Trump has gone even farther than his Democratic populist counterpart, calling for ripping up trade deals and reintroducing tariffs while Sanders says he just wants to cut better deals.

And from a national security point of view, Sanders and Trump havent explained what they would replace the global trade regime with as a symmetric soft power force for peace.

In Michigan, trade may have tipped the balance for some.

On Friday, the first layoffs will begin at a Dematic plant in Grand Rapids that is moving to Mexico. The plant makes conveyor belt systems for distribution centers.

Scott Wahlfeldt, a welder and the president of the local chapter of the UAW, said the day before the election that he was undecided.

Standing outside the plant, he said that while he blamed Bill Clinton for signing NAFTA, he also never made more money than under the former president. Hilarys been there, shes walked the walk. She has the best chance, he said. My head says vote for Hillary, and my heart says vote for Bernie.

The next day, he texted to say his whole family ended up deciding to vote for Sanders. Kent County, which contains Grand Rapids and where the plant closing was covered in the local press, was one of Sanders strongest areas, favoring him 62-37 percent.",[]
msnbc.com,,"In hard-hit Ohio steel town, Trump and Sanders resonate",['Leigh Ann Caldwell'],"LORAIN, Ohio  The landscape here looks like a wasteland. And its about to get worse.

Two steel mills in this city, 30 miles west of Cleveland on Lake Erie, are set to close by the end of March, laying off hundreds of people in an area that has seen jobs slowly erode for more than two decades.

The final 130 workers at Republic Steel will be out of work when the plant rolls its final order of steel tubular products for oil drilling and fracking equipment in two weeks. And at U.S. Steel, the final 200 workers will also be out of jobs at the end of March.

Its a sad month, said Brian Sealy, a union official for the United Steelworkers in Lorain. Overall the trickle-down effect on this community - the closed-up downtown - continues. That trickle-down effect is devastating to a community like this.

Downtown Lorain is dotted with boarded businesses and deteriorating buildings while dollar stores and run-down used car lots fill in the gaps. The downtown is mostly empty, hosting building after building of blight and despair.

RELATED: Why trade matters in the Rust Belt

Its a much different scenario than 30 years ago in the 1980s when the steel mills, the largest employers in town, were busy and employed more than 10,000 people.

Now the town of 64,000 people is facing a deficit of more than $2 million dollars in large part because of the loss of tax revenue from steel workers.

Union workers blame trade deals, especially the North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, passed in 1993. And with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, another trade deal with Asian countries, on the verge of passing, Sealy said the future looks blight.

Theres going to be a lot more offshoring of jobs and thats going to affect us directly, Sealy said.

The closing of the steel mills and the looming threat of TPP are coming to the fore while a contentious presidential primary is heading straight to Lorain as Ohio holds its primary Tuesday.

In this traditionally Democratic stronghold, Donald Trump is working for those voters who feel that their livelihood is in jeopardy.

The county of Lorain backed President Barack Obama in 2008 with 58 percent and 56 percent in 2012.

But not only is Donald Trump the only Republican candidate to open an office there, hes the only candidate in both parties to invest resources by paying staff to be here. His office opened on February 29.

Residents of Lorain reflect the profile of the Trump voter.

For instance, in Michigan, a state Trump won, 54 percent of voters said trade takes jobs away from Americans. Of those, nearly half - 42 percent - voted for Trump.

Trump is also appealing to the voter that identifies as independent. Also in Michigan, 37 percent of self-identified independents backed Trump and in Georgia and 40 percent in Minnesota.

David Moore, a volunteer for Trump in Lorain County, said hes not surprised that workers in the heavily Democratic county would back Trump.

Right now NAFTA has really screwed with this area, and hes talking about NAFTA, Moore said. Thats what these people want to hear. Hes talking about jobs. Its all about jobs.

He thought rundown downtown Lorain was the perfect place to set up shop.

That kind of shows - lets go back to NAFTA  when jobs leave this is what happens to downtown, Moore said. It kinda shows whats going on in our area.

During nearly every campaign speech, Trump is critical of trade deals. Its a position counter to that of traditional Republicans who support free trade.

China has taken millions of jobs, thousands of factories. What theyve done to us, its actually, I thought about it the other day, its the greatest theft in the history of the world, Trump said after his win in Michigan Tuesday.

He added: You take a look at, as an example, in Chicago where you have Nabisco moves its big plant  theyre closing their plant. Theyre moving to Mexico. Ford, building a $2 1/2 billion factory, cars, in Mexico. I mean, we cant continue to do it.

Trump doesnt sound much different than a union worker.

Politicians have to wake up and see the devastation, Sealy said. Whether its a bad trade agreement or like companies going offshore like Nabisco in Chicago. ... Its hard to believe the government doesnt see this.

Sealy is not a Trump supporters and his union is likely to back a Democrat when and if it does endorse. But Sealy admits, I do understand his appeal.

Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO, also admitted that Trump has struck a nerve, even with Democratic voters. But Trumka told NBC News that his federation will be educating their members about each candidates record, including that Trump, he says, is not friend to workers. He points to his efforts to block efforts to unionize at his own property in Las Vegas.

Ohio will be a big trade state so his clear position on trade will help him there, but when you give the members the full facts, Trumka said, I think youre going to see more and more people shying away from him.

Trump will be competing against three other Republicans, including Ohio gov. John Kasich, who are much more supportive of free trade deals than Trump.

Sanders, meanwhile, also has a presence in this working-class enclave of northeast Ohio. He, too, deplores the trade deals and often criticizes his opponent Hillary Clinton for her husbands role in passing NAFTA and her support of TPP until she came out against it during her presidential campaign.

Sanders campaign office, however, is volunteer-run and -funded. Alan Pugh, who has never participated in politics before, opened the office in downtown Elyria. He and fellow volunteers pay for the rent and all the utilities out of their own coffers.

Having Bernie and Donald trump both having offices down here speaks to an anti-establishment mentality so the end of establishment politics and economics. People are looking for something a little different than theyve experienced in the past 30 years, Pugh said.

Sealy is living it.

Were struggling everywhere right now. To us its a crisis.

msnbc.com,,John Kasich accuses Donald Trump of fostering 'toxic environment' at rallies,[],"SHARONVILLE, Ohio  Ohio Gov. John Kasich railed against his GOP rival Donald Trump on Saturday, accusing him of creating a toxic environment at his rallies.

Kasichs comments come a day after Trumps rally in Chicago where violence broke out in protester scuffles, and the governor seemed to back away from pledging support for the real estate mogul if he becomes the Republican Party nominee.

Donald Trump has created a toxic environment, Kasich told reporters. And a toxic environment has allowed his supporters and those who sometimes seek confrontation to come together in violence. There is no place for this, there is no place for a national leader to prey on the fears of people who live in our great country.

Kasich was asked directly about whether he would still support Trump if he becomes the presumptive nominee as he indicated he would at the recent GOP debate in Detroit.

Makes it very, extremely difficult, Kasich said. When pressed, he also told reporters: Lets just everybody take a deep breath and well see where it goes.

RELATED: How Bernie Sanders supporters shut down a Donald Trump rally in Chicago

Over the last few months, Kasich would rarely speak negatively of Trump or any of the other candidates, even when consistently prodded. But he noted that he was one of the first candidates to take on Trump in October when he tore into him at a rally in Columbus and in the subsequent debate.

That strategy, however, was short-lived, and he quickly returned to resisting direct attacks on the other candidates  Trump included.

Kasich told reporters Saturday that he was shocked and deeply disturbed by images he watched on television Friday night of the fallout from Trump canceling an event in Chicago.

To see Americans slugging themselves at a political rally deeply disturbed me, he said. We are better than that. We are a nation that overcomes obstacles and challenges.

Kasich made the comments before speaking at the Northeast Hamilton County Republican Club Pancake Breakfast outside Cincinnati  just as Trump was down the road preparing for a rally in Dayton.

That rally escalated when a man rushed toward the stage, causing Secret Service agents swiftly swarm around Trump to protect him. The man was escorted away and charged with disorderly conduct and inducing panic.

On Friday night, before the situation in Chicago escalated and dominated national headlines, Kasich was asked about violence at Trump events and told reporters that he didnt want to see physical force at any rally.

RELATED: John Kasich: Im going to be the Republican nominee after we win Ohio

He maintained Saturday that he didnt speak out more forcefully sooner because he did not have all the facts about what was going on and has tried to stay above the fray.

I just believe the negative attacks and the rhetoric  and that includes what weve been seeing the last few weeks, or the last few debates, the name calling  Ive stayed positive through this and frankly there are times when I want to stay out of it, because I dont want to lower the bar, Kasich said.

The governor has taken credit for the more civil discourse in the most recent debate in Miami, quipping that his positive demeanor was contagious to the other candidates, and speaking to reporters Saturday morning, he continued his harsh critiques of campaign media coverage.

Im pleased to see the other candidates in the last debate began to realize that name calling, that lowering the bar on American politics is not acceptable, Kasich said. I believe they have learned, at least in the last debate that ideas matter, that vision matters. That policies matter  and giving people hope matters.

I refuse to do it this entire campaign, Kasich continued. Even if it meant that I would be ignored, even if it meant that I would lose.

msnbc.com,,Sanders campaign praises Ohio ruling that allows 17-year-olds to vote,[],"An Ohio court ruled on Friday that 17-year-olds who will turn 18 by the November general election are eligible to vote in the states primary on March 15.

This is a huge victory for 17-year-olds across Ohio, said Brad Deutsch, Bernie Sanders campaign attorney said after the ruling. Their votes for presidential nominees will now count when they vote on either Tuesday or over the weekend in early voting.

Sanders campaign, which has a strong young voter base, filed a lawsuit against Ohios Secretary of State Jon Husted, a Republican, in federal court on Tuesday. The suit argued that Husted is trying to prevent young voters from participating in the primary election. The Sanders federal case is still pending.

With the help of new and young voters, Sanders is hoping to pull off another political upset in Ohio. His unexpected win over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in Michigans primary was steered by his popularity with young voters. The NBC News Exit Poll of the primary found that voters between ages 18 and 29 represented 19 percent of the Michigan electorate, and 81 percent of them voted for Sanders.

According to FairVote, a voting-rights advocacy group, at least 20 other states allow 17-year-olds to vote in presidential primaries or caucuses.

Under Ohio state law since 1981, 17-year-olds who turn 18 before the general election had been eligible to vote in the primary. But in December, Husted published a revised election manual stating that 17-year-olds were not permitted to vote in presidential primaries because voters elect delegates to the party convention.

Husted blasted the courts decision and initially planned to appeal the ruling. But he reversed his promise after learning that a state appeals court would hear the case on Monday, the day before the primary.

Even if we were to prevail, there is no effective way to responsibly make the changes necessary to implement an orderly election, Husted said in a statement Friday. We will not proceed with an appeal on this decision and I will direct all county boards of elections later this evening to comply with the court order.",[]

Dont scream at protestors, sing! read a flyer passed out to the thousands of Trump fans waiting for his rally at the I-X Center on Saturday. The sheets included lyrics to America the Beautiful. It didnt take  the crowd booed the inevitable interruptions while Trump told security to get them the hell out.

The event went more smoothly than Trumps morning event in Dayton, Ohio, however, when Secret Service agents leapt to protect Trump as a man rushed the stage.

We want to be peaceful, Michael Brigeman, a high school senior in an NRA shirt, said as he waited for the rally. Then again, no ones going to back down if someone starts something.

Every one of Trumps rivals across both parties this week have accused the candidate of encouraging violence at his rallies, an issue that came to a head after a heated standoff on Friday between supporters and left-wing protesters that forced him to cancel a speech in Chicago. Trump has told crowds hed like to punch protesters in the face, that he pines for the days when protesters would be carried out in a stretcher and even offered to pay legal fees for anyone who would knock the crap out of protesters if they threw tomatoes at him.

The fans that waited hours in line for his afternoon rally in Cleveland Saturday werent happy with the recent news out of Chicago. But they argued that it was unfair to blame Trump even as some admitted theyd prefer he dial back his rhetoric.

Mike Bokulich, a studiously polite 73-year-old veteran holding a sign outside of the rally, attributed the Chicago fiasco to the citys history as a hotbed of progressive activism. He believed the same confrontations would have broken out if any other Republican held a major event at a college campus there.

Let them go to Chicago and see what happens, Bokulich said. This has been going on for years.

Jeff Marshaus, a 53-year-old truck driver wearing a plastic Trump sign, was upset with the coverage of individual Trump supporters, like the elderly man who was arrested after striking a protester on video this week.

Its thousands of people  he cant control everyone, Marshaus said.

Trump, on some level, is concerned about his image as well. Darrell Scott, the African-American pastor who introduced him on Saturday, used his speech to call attention to the supporters behind him holding an American Sikhs for Trump sign and an American Muslims for Trump sign. The event, as always, opened with a recorded message telling supporters not to harm protesters who have taken advantage of Mr. Trumps hospitality.

Two Republicans, Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, hinted on Saturday that they were reconsidering their pledges to support Trump as the GOP nominee in response to the chaos at his events. Rubio in particular sounded deeply shaken when addressing the topic.

Its called anarchy, Rubio said. And thats what were careening towards.

Audience members in Cleveland, however, were skeptical of the sincerity of Trumps critics. Many are on guard for efforts by GOP leaders to wrest the nomination from Trump at the national convention and assume the latest criticism is yet another political ploy to drag him down.

Theyre losing, so theyre going to say whatever they think will help them, Art Figureo, an electrician from Akron, said.

Most supporters who talked to MSNBC blamed the unrest in Chicago on supporters of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders  Bernies crowd, as Trump sneered in his speech  and the Black Lives Matter movement, which frequently protests Trump events. But distrust of GOP leaders is so high that some Trump supporters volunteered that the protesters popping up at Trumps rallies were Republican plants.

I think its staged, 50-50 Democrats and Republicans, Marshaus said. They dont want Trump, and theyre going for brokered convention.

I think [George] Soros is behind it and probably other Republicans, too, Mary Jane Sobeski, 66, said.

Progressive activist groups, some who are supporting Bernie Sanders, say they organized the Chicago protests on social media.

The scene outside Saturdays rally included a mix of smiling faces and vulgar signs that reflected the candidates personal style.

Get your Hillary sucks, but not like Monica shirts! one vendor shouted outside with the cadence used to sell a stadium brat. Trump that bitch on the back, get your shirts!

Donald Fing Trump! another shouted a few feet away. Get your Donald Fing Trump!

Already got mine! a 20-something supporter with wraparound shades and a bright white Donald Fing Trump shirt said.

As is the case with Trumps speeches, things got angrier and darker at times, too. An irate Trump supporter in camouflage gear screamed go back to Africa at a Black Lives Matter protester outside the venue.

Not everyone is crazy about the nastiest lines in Trump speeches, though. Its actually fairly common to hear Trump fans who love his message on trade and immigration, love that he sticks it to political correctness, but still wish he were a touch milder.

I wish I was his consultant sometimes after debates, but people admire that hes not PC, Bokulich told MSNBC. So hes not presidential. Obama was presidential, and look where it got us.

He gets a little crazy sometimes  its a little scary, Michelle Weber, a 53-year-old medical administrator, admitted while adding she didnt blame Trump for violence.

Some supporters said they regard Trumps baiting as part of an election season act that no one should take too seriously. In the White House, they argued, things would be different.

You know how Ben Carson said there were two Trumps? Frederick James, a retired military police officer who served in three wars, said. Theres the serious side and the joking side.

Joe, a young Trump volunteer working the rally who asked that his last name not be printed, echoed the sentiment.

Maybe he needs to tone it down, but it is part of his gimmick, he said. When hes in office this will die down, but hes doing what he needs to do to get elected.

The regular outrageous moments, he said, are what sets him apart from the other candidates and generate necessary media attention. Hes not a career politician  no one would have paid attention otherwise.

Randall Malus, a 33-year-old writer in a three-piece suit and a Finally, someone with balls pin, told MSNBC that the uncomfortable scenes now playing out in the news were destined to occur whether or not Trump arrived on the scene.

msnbc.com,,Donald Trump on supporters' anger: 'I'm just a messenger',['Shawna T Thomas'],"While acknowledging that he does not condone violence in any shape, Donald Trump said of the atmosphere of his campaign events, I dont accept responsibility.

At Trump rallies in the last week, one protester was punched in the face, a man was stopped by Secret Service when he tried to rush the stage and Trumps Chicago rally had to be called off due to flare ups and fighting in the arena.

When asked specifically about the man who was punched by a Trump supporter, the real estate mogul blamed the victim.

I will tell you from what I saw, the young man stuck his finger up in the air, and the other man sort of just had it, told Chuck Todd on NBCs Meet the Press on Sunday. But I still, I dont condone violence.

He went absolutely wild punching, and frankly, when they punch, its okay. When my people punch back because they have to out of self-defense, everybody says, Oh, isnt that terrible? The fact is, that we have very peaceful rallies.

There is no indication that the man who was attacked threw any punches  he was being led out by security when he was ambushed by the Trump supporter. There is video showing the young man raising his middle finger before he is punched in the face. When pressed as to whether someone being vulgar condones being hurt, Trump responded:

No, as I told you before, nothing condones. But I want to see. The man got carried away, he was 78 years old, he obviously loves his country, and maybe he doesnt like seeing whats happening to the country. I want to see the full tape. But I dont condone violence.

Publicly, Trump has said before that he would be willing to pay the legal fees of a supporter that is charged with hurting a protester at one of his events and he did not back down from that promise today.

Ive actually instructed my people to look into it, Trump said.

Trump blamed the growing tension at his rallies on people being sick and tired of this country being run by incompetent people that dont know what theyre doing on trade deals, where our jobs are being ripped out of our countries.

Theyre not angry about something Im saying. Im just a messenger, he said. The people are angry about the fact that for 12 years, the workers in this country havent had a pay increase.

msnbc.com,,Kasich says 'it's tough' when asked if he would support Trump as nominee,[],"Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, responded to increasing tensions at opponent Donald Trumps rallies and was pressed on whether he will support Trump if he wins the Republican nomination. He responded, Its tough, I mean, but hes not going to be the nominee.

Over the weekend, Kasich said Trump was getting close to disqualifying himself from the nomination. Lets see what happens, Kasich told Chuck Todd on NBCs Meet the Press when asked what it would take for Trump to disqualify himself.

The Ohio governor further lamented the tone of the Trump campaign:

Everything is negative. Everything is, Americas losing, and were terrible. I mean, come on. Look, weve got our challenges. People are worried about the security of their job, theyre worried about the wages, theyre worried about not getting any interest in the bank, theyre worried about their kids future.

Looking ahead to Tuesdays contests, Kasich - who leads Trump by 6 points in his home state - assured supporters, Im going to win Ohio with the great support, I hope, of the Ohio folks here.

Sen. Marco Rubios campaign has encouraged supporters in Ohio to back Kasich if their goal is to defeat Donald Trump. Questioned on if he would ask his supporters in Florida to do the same, Kasich demurred. My voters are not like robots where I can say, Go do something, OK? How do you run for office and tell people to vote for somebody else? the Ohio governor said.

But would Kasich like to see Rubio win Florida? Id like to win Florida, he protested, but I dont see that its in the cards. Kasich also said he called Sen. Rubio to wish him luck in the Sunshine State, but was not able to reach him.

Asked if his team is coordinating with the other Republican campaigns in an effort to deny Trump delegates, Kasich responded: No, no. Im not...if its going on, Im unaware of it.

Finally, on his own electoral chances going forward, Kasich assured supporters, Dont be surprised if I go to the convention with the largest number of delegates. He concluded that it is likely there will be some sort of multi-ballot convention, but, he continued, You never know in politics...whats true today is not necessarily true tomorrow.

msnbc.com,,Hillary Clinton: 'I made a mistake' on the Reagans' HIV/AIDS legacy,[],"On Saturday, Hillary Clinton apologized at length for her remarks earlier in the week on Ronald and Nancy Reagan and their legacy on HIV and AIDS, calling her comments a mistake, plain and simple.

At former First Lady Nancy Reagans funeral, Clinton told MSNBCs Andrea Mitchell that the couple started a national conversation about the epidemic, prompting a swift backlash.

RELATED: Clinton apologizes for praising Nancy Reagans HIV/AIDS legacy

It may be hard for your viewers to remember how difficult it was for people to talk about HIV/AIDS back in the 1980s, Clinton told Mitchell. And because of both President and Mrs. Reagan  in particular, Mrs. Reagan  we started a national conversation when before no one would talk about it, no one wanted to do anything about it. And that too is something that I really appreciate, with her very effective, low-key advocacy, but it penetrated the public conscience, and people began to say, Hey, we have to do something about this, too.

Many found Clintons assertion problematic, and it revived criticisms of the Reagan administrations policies on drugs and response to the public health crisis. The presidential candidate later said she misspoke in a statement released hours after the interview.

Hillary Clintons statement on her comments about the Reagans record on HIV and AIDS: pic.twitter.com/RtIs0zpJfk  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 11, 2016

Clinton addressed her critics in greater detail in a post on the blog-publishing platform Medium on Saturday evening.

Yesterday, at Nancy Reagans funeral, I said something inaccurate when speaking about the Reagans record on HIV and AIDS, Clinton wrote. Since then, Ive heard from countless people who were devastated by the loss of friends and loved ones, and hurt and disappointed by what I said. As someone who has also lost friends and loved ones to AIDS, I understand why. I made a mistake, plain and simple.

The former secretary of state then attributed the discourse surrounding the epidemic to activists and advocates who raised awareness about HIV and AIDS and invoked the mantra that silence ultimately equates to resigning to death.

To be clear, the Reagans did not start a national conversation about HIV and AIDS, the post continued. That distinction belongs to generations of brave lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, along with straight allies, who started not just a conversation but a movement that continues to this day.

Clinton then delineated her policy platforms on health care, drugs, HIV and AIDS.

For the first time, an AIDS-free generation is in sight, Clinton said. As president, I promise you that I will not let up until we reach that goal. We will not leave anyone behind.",[]

The controversial candidate blamed bad, bad people for the disruptions, which came just a day after fights between Trump supporters and protesters erupted in Chicago.

I hope these guys get thrown in jail  theyll never do it again, Trump said on Saturday. Itll destroy their record, theyll have to explain to mom and dad why they have a police record and why they cant get a job. And you know what? Im going to start pressing charges against these people.

I dont want to ruin peoples lives. But the only way were going to stop this craziness is if we press charges, he added.

RELATED: Trump supporters weigh in on violence at rallies

It isnt clear what charges Trump might be referring to.

Trump  who was repeatedly interrupted during his speech at the Midland Theatre  accused Bernie Sanders supporters of being behind the protests and had them removed.

Outside the event, police used pepper spray two times on demonstrators, Kansas City police said. Four people were arrested but there were no serious injuries of property damage, police added.

Kansas City Police Chief Darryl Forte said on Twitter most in downtown area lawfully expressed themselves while lawfully assembling. He said a fogger was used on two large groups preparing to fight.

Though Trump claimed he spoke to police and they said why dont you cancel, the police chief said later that he was not aware of any discussion about cancelling the event.

It was after Trump cancelled an event in Chicago on Friday over what he said were security concerns that chaotic scenes broke out, with scuffles and fistfights inside and outside the University of Illinois at Chicago Pavilion.

There was more drama on Saturday when a man attempted to get on stage at a rally in Ohio and sparked a security scare  then the latest protests in Kansas City.

These are bad, bad people, and were going to take our country back from these people, Trump told the crowd amid chants of USA! USA!

Trump has come under mounting criticism  from Democrats and from Republican rivals  for failing to fully denounce violent incidents at his events and for creating a climate where such incidents can persist.

Those issues were amplified in recent days after video emerged of a man at a Trump rally sucker-punching a protester leaving an event in North Carolina and after a Breitbart reporter accused Trumps campaign manager grabbing her hard enough to cause a bruise. The campaign manager has denied the claim.

Trump himself has said he would like to punch a protester in the face and see another taken out on a stretcher.

On Saturday, he urged security to treat protesters gently.

See, Im a non violent person, did you know that about me? he told the crowd and dismissed the protesters inside the theater as supporters of Sanders, the Democratic presidential hopeful.

RELATED: Trump blames thugs for violence at postponed Chicago rally

The Sanders campaign has denied involvement in the protests.

One Sanders supporter among the crowds on Saturday night was Matt McCann.

A self-described big fan of the open marketplace of ideas, McCann said he came to look and to listen but not to cause trouble.

Eventually Donald Trumps ideas are going to lose, he said. We just have to let them lose.

He said Trumps remarks about arresting protesters ran contrary to what this entire country is about, saying that nonviolent protest is important.

Someone needs to be here pushing back, he told NBC News.

msnbc.com,,"Despite 'demagoguery', Cruz still committed to Trump if nominee",['Vaughn Hillyard'],"Despite suggesting Donald Trump would be a disaster as president and runs a campaign that encourages violence and disrespects voters, Sen. Ted Cruz on Sunday reaffirmed his commitment to support the New York businessman in the general election if he becomes the GOP nominee.

Cruz said on NBCs Meet the Press that Trump would be a disaster  but suggested this weekend that Hillary Clinton would do even more damage to the country and be the lesser of two evils.

If Hillary is the president, we will lose the Supreme Court for a generation [and] the Second Amendment will be written out of the Bill of Rights, Cruz said in the interview.

He also insisted that he will not waver on the commitments he made in previous months to support the eventual nominee  even if its Trump.

I pledged at the outset I will support the Republican nominee whoever it is, Cruz stated.

But Cruzs insistence on supporting Trump if he is the nominee is pared with emphatic rebukes of the same man.

When you have a campaign that disrespects the voters, when you have a campaign that affirmatively encourages violence, you create an environment that only encourages this sort of nastiness, Cruz said.

He added that he is troubled by the rallies that Donald holds, specifically questioning Trumps request that voters pledge their support to him.

We dont pledge allegiance to a man, Cruz belabored, adding: That is something you see kings and queens doing of their subjects.

The Texas senator also laid responsibility for the outbursts violence this past week on the protesters acting abusively and wrong, saying the First Amendment doesnt give you a right to silence others.

Whether its Black Lives Matter or Bernie Sanders protesters who are coming in just trying to shout down any speaker, thats not free speech, he continued.

Cruz also compared the demagoguery of Trump to President Obama, who he called a world class demagogue for his language designed to divide us.

The candidate responded in the interview to an audio recording of President Obama at a recent fundraiser, where the president suggested todays political hysteria is not an accident and was fostered for years by people being told we should be angry about America and that the economys a disaster  and that were weak.

Cruz fired back: That language is the kind of self-righteous moralizing from the president that makes people angry.

Cruz took a populist message to explain the anger, saying the animosity is directed at politicians who have been cutting deals that are enriching the rich and powerful, the special interests and the big corporations, while working men and women are seeing their wages stagnating.

Florida and Ohio  both delegate-rich states  will vote on Tuesday, when Cruz hopes the GOP field will narrow to just two men.

But tactically, its not clear whether Trump victories in the state would hurt or help Cruzs chances at the nomination  though the Cruz campaign has implied for weeks its intentions to force Rubio out of the race by losing his home state.

But Cruz said his campaign is not engaged in this delegate-denial strategy in Florida.

Cruz pointed to the other three states also heading to the polls on Tuesday, looking at those as prospects for picking up delegates and softening the impact of potential losses in Florida and Ohio.

I can tell you we are neck and neck right now in North Carolina, Cruz said. Were neck and neck right now in Missouri, and were neck and neck right now in Illinois.

When pressed on his chances of winning the nomination, Cruz did not rule out a duel with Trump at a contested convention.

But he made clear that any attempt by the Republican Party to inject an alternative candidate into a contested convention race would be a disaster where people would revolt.

msnbc.com,,Lessons of Teaneck: Town's journey from riot to redemption after cop shooting,['Jon Schuppe'],"TEANECK, N.J.  The teenager had a pistol in his pocket, and when the cops came, he bolted.

They chased him into a backyard. He stopped and began to turn. One of the officers, fearing he would shoot, fired his service revolver.

The 16-year-old victim was black. The officer was white. And that gunshot, fired nearly 26 years ago, sparked a cataclysm.

It marked the end of a life, a career and a communitys idealism. It took a terrible toll on the teens family, and on the officer, who withdrew for more than two decades before breaking his silence last week.

But the aftershock also opened a long path to healing that remains relevant today, as a wave of unrest over police killings has swept the country, cleaving communities and raising thorny questions about Americas relationship with law enforcement.

TEANECK STILL STRUGGLES TO MAINTAIN RACIAL AND ETHNIC UNITY, BUT THE TOWN NOW STANDS AS A POSSIBLE LESSON FOR PLACES LIKE FERGUSON, NORTH CHARLESTON, CLEVELAND, BALTIMORE.

The crisis unfolded in Teaneck, a small suburb five miles from New York City long considered a model of racial harmony. Decades earlier, the township had fought block-busting, a ploy by real-estate speculators to induce fear of black homeowners, and had voluntarily integrated its schools, telling the world it welcomed newcomers of all faiths and shades.

Beneath that equanimity, however, was a festering resentment over the predominantly white police forces treatment of blacks. The bullet that pierced the boys heart shattered the facade.

That fatal encounter transformed Teaneck from a symbol of unity into one of intolerance, and plunged it into a long period of self-examination, and, eventually, recovery.

The journey remains unfinished. But Teaneck stands as a possible lesson for communities still roiling from recent police shootings: Ferguson, North Charleston, Cleveland, Baltimore, Chicago.

Trouble in a model town

This wasnt supposed to happen in Teaneck. The township seemed to have it all: neat neighborhoods of single-family homes, a stable commercial district, solid schools. Decades earlier, the Army Corps of Engineers had picked Teaneck  believed to be named after a Native American term for villages  as an archetype of small-town America. But what made this place special in 1990 was its fiercely cultivated image of harmonious multiculturalism.

A quarter of Teanecks 38,000 residents were black, many enticed across the Hudson River from New York to pursue middle-class lives. Another third were Jewish. Many minorities were concentrated in small areas, but the mix made most people proud.

Phillip Pannells family moved to Teaneck chasing that middle-class dream. But his father, Phillip Sr., struggled with drugs and alcohol, which spun him into a cycle of unemployment and jail that broke the family apart. Phillip, meanwhile, was getting into fights with kids from neighboring Englewood, part of an old rivalry between the towns. The situation worsened when his mother, Thelma, moved him and his younger sister there. As a new student in Englewood, Phillip became a target.

Friends and family said Phillip felt threatened. That, they said, probably explained why, on April 10, 1990, he was carrying a beat-up starters pistol, converted to hold bullets, that hed found among his mothers things.

Early that evening, a man called Teaneck police and said hed seen a boy with a gun among kids in a schoolyard. Two officers responded. One of them was Gary Spath, 29, who was born and raised in town and had followed his father onto the force.

He chased Phillip behind a house. In a quick confrontation, Spath opened fire, hitting Pannell in the back.

Some witnesses said the teen appeared to be surrendering. Spath believed otherwise.

He had a gun in his pocket and he was going to shoot me, he later testified.

Upheaval

Pannells death split residents into camps: those who believed Spath acted properly in response to a grave threat, and those who saw it as the culmination of years of harassment by biased cops. The day after the shooting, a group of black youths overturned police cars and broke shop windows. The national media showed up.

This really opened the eyes of people, said Theodora Lacey, a civil rights leader and retired teacher. There were these sweet young people who had grown up in an integrated setting. So it was just seemingly contrary to what we thought we were teaching and bringing about through integration  that you could have a young, white cop shoot and kill.

The marches began: college students one day, local and out-of-town activists the next, cops on another. They went on for years as the case progressed through the legal system  a grand jurys decision not to indict Spath, claims of a botched autopsy, a second that concluded bullet holes showed Pannells hands were in the air, a new grand jurys charging Spath with manslaughter and, finally, Spaths 1992 acquittal by an all-white jury.

In 1994, Pannells family settled a civil rights lawsuit against Teaneck for nearly $200,000. The U.S. Justice Department decided against a criminal case. Eventually, the calls for justice subsided.

But not the soul-searching.

From the first sign of unrest, Teaneck leaders began organizing community meetings, tapping into a long tradition of consensus-building that had helped the township through prior crises, including a 1964 school integration fight. At these forums, students, police, elected officials and civil-rights activists confronted their differences on a range of issues: the distrust between cops and blacks, the dearth of minorities in the police department, institutional racism in the schools, white flight, falling home values. Many whites were surprised to hear blacks complaints of everyday racist treatment.

It became clear that while their township was integrated, the people of Teaneck didnt truly know each other.

A sisters despair

Natacha Pannell was 13 when she accompanied her mother to Holy Name Hospital and watched doctors pull back the sheet that covered Phillips body. Thelma fell to the table; Natacha picked grass out of her older brothers hair.

They didnt see the body again for several weeks, at a wake that drew hundreds, including dozens of Phillips former classmates as well as firebrand ministers Al Sharpton and Louis Farrakhan. Clergy and activists placed his death on a national list of black and Hispanic people killed by white police officers.

Natachas mother withdrew in grief. Her father joined the protesters. Natacha, desperate to understand Phillips death, joined him.

I felt like through marches and things like that, that I was going to be closer  closer to the truth, or closer to the reason why he wasnt with me anymore, Natacha, now 39, recalled.

The answers didnt come easily.

On the surface, Natacha seemed to do OK. She graduated high school and college, had a son, and went into community-service work. But she felt out of step with the world: picked on, angry, distrustful.

She and her mother grew distant. Her father, whod gotten clean after Phillips death, returned to alcohol, and for a time was homeless.

Natacha wrestled with guilt. In the weeks before the shooting, shed seen Phillip looking for the old starters pistol. She told him where it was, but made him promise to never take it. For years, I felt like it was my fault, she said.

It would take decades to forgive herself.

Its a horrible thing

Gary Spath, a married father of young children, was suspended with pay after the shooting. Protesters accused him of racism. Jesse Jackson called him an executioner. The media examined his service record, and found several commendations but also prior incidents in which hed fired his weapon without hitting anyone. Spaths supporters rallied to his side, but the officer himself did not speak publicly, quietly enduring what he later described as a living hell.

When the jury acquitted him two years later, Spath held his wife, Nancy, in a long embrace and wept, while Thelma Pannell was escorted from the courtroom, wailing. Afterward, he said his family was praying the Pannells would find peace. He retired on an accidental disability pension, for which he received monthly payments of $3,622.

Spath held odd jobs and considered a return to police work. But he and his wife finally decided that the only way to rebuild their lives was to leave. They moved their three children to the eastern tip of Long Island, New York, where he found work in school security.

For a long time, Spath was angry and bitter at having been cast as a racist, trigger-happy cop. Those feelings subsided, but returned whenever he saw his name resurface in local coverage of a police shooting, or a racially charged issue.

His breaking point came in August 2014, when Ferguson, Missouri erupted in riots following a white police officers fatal shooting of a black teenager. He saw a lot of similarities with his experience, and was maddened by new mentions of his name in the press. He began to feel the need to tell his story.

ITS WITH ME EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE. BUT I KEEP GOING FORWARD. - Gary Spath

In a brief interview with NBC News, Spath, now 55 and a grandfather, said he would never get over taking Phillip Pannells life, but didnt regret what he did, because the teen posed an immediate danger.

As right as I was in the eyes of the law, Im a human being, and its a horrible thing that happened, Spath said. But I dont think I could have responded in any other way.

He broke his public silence on Wednesday, when he appeared as the keynote speaker at a police union convention in Atlantic City. In a Caesars banquet hall, Spath shared what its like to be the white officer who kills a young black person.

Growing up in Teaneck felt straight out of Norman Rockwell painting, he said. But the shootings aftermath taught him about the brutal intersection of race and politics. He described the second grand jury as a witch hunt, recalled out-of-town protesters as thugs, and said the media crucified me.

Today, he said, his best memories were not of the guts and glory aspects of police work but of playing stickball with kids, shoveling someones driveway, changing a tire. Those are the things I miss most, he said.

Spath credited his wife for keeping him together, saying his life was nothing short of a miracle. Doing positive things helped  to an extent.

My shooting will never go away, he said. Its with me every day of my life. But I keep moving forward. I take each day as it comes.

Reckoning

Paul Tiernan was a lieutenant in the Teaneck Police Department, studying for a masters in criminal justice when Pannell was shot. His research focused on community policing. Most of the early programs were used in high-crime urban neighborhoods, but Tiernan saw potential in the increasingly diverse American suburbs, including his own.

Tiernan saw a link between Teanecks troubles and an enforcement-driven police strategy that dominated in the years leading up to the Pannell shooting. The approach, driven by ticket quotas, made residents  especially blacks  feel that officers were always trying to catch them doing something wrong. Those grievances fueled the post-shooting unrest, which in turn decimated morale among police officers, who couldnt understand why the community didnt support them. Teaneck officers still recall being heckled for years with shouts of, Dont shoot me!

In early 1994, the department adopted Tiernans proposal. Officers went door to door handing out surveys and introducing themselves. They hosted community meetings and set up neighborhood watch programs. They held civilian training academies to show people what it was like to be a cop. They learned how to handle touchy situations with more sensitivity.

There had been a total break with the community, and then we got everyone talking to each other, Tiernan recalled. The program was regarded as a success, and got Tiernan appointed chief in 2003.

Similar efforts were underway elsewhere in town. The school district worked to resolve complaints that black students were being marginalized. The township built a new recreation center for kids who otherwise had few after-school opportunities. In homes and houses of worship, residents discussed the townships racial divisions.

Gradually, Teaneck regained control of its journey.

We found that if we spoke to one another ... looked each other in the eye and understood each others perspective, there was more civility, more respect for one another, said Paul Ostrow, who was elected to the Township Council a few weeks after the shooting. You just had to pick the right adjectives. And rather than picking hate, mistrust, separate, we picked understand, get together, rebuild.

I believe in this town

Shawn Robinson counted Phillip Pannell as his friend. He was 14 at the time of the shooting and lived across the street from the house where it occurred. At that time, nothing like that had happened in our neighborhood, or to me, he recalled. I was hurt. Traumatized.

For a long time, Robinson said, he had a hard time trusting police. But he didnt hold grudges against them, or white people. He credits Teaneck for that.

I always had white friends, Hispanic friends, Robinson said. I still have friends of different backgrounds, and that really comes from our upbringing, and how the town handled (the shooting). They didnt push hate on us.

IM PROUD OF THE WAY WE HANDLED IT, IN TERMS OF BROTHERHOOD AND MANKIND. I BELIEVE IN THE TOWN. - Shawn Robinson

Teaneck, he said, can show the country how to move forward.

We didnt get the justice that we were seeking, but Im proud of the way we handled it, in terms of brotherhood and mankind, Robinson said. I believe in the town.

Teaneck still touts itself as a little United Nations. The mayor is a black woman. The township council includes a black, a Muslim and an Orthodox Jew. The black population has remained about the same since 1990, while many whites have left and been replaced with Hispanics. More than a third of teachers, and about 14 percent of police, are minorities.

An officer hasnt shot someone since Pannells death, police say. The community policing bureau was discontinued in 2010, then resurrected in a more modest format.

As tragic as the event was, something good did come out of it, said Robert Carney, who was a young officer on the night of the Pannell shooting and is now the police chief. Theres a better relationship and understanding between the community and Police Department.

But many worry that Teaneck has grown complacent. With the influx of Orthodox Jews, many of whom send their children to private schools, and the departure of other whites, the public schools have become 87 percent non-white. That leaves fewer opportunities for residents of different backgrounds to know each other. Two years ago, parents accused the police of overreacting to a prank in which 63 students, many of them black, were arrested for vandalizing the high school, drawing national headlines.

Allison Davis, a former NBC News journalist who now runs an arts advocacy organization, said the generation of residents who lived through integration and the Pannell shooting are moving away or dying.

And so what weve got now is a community with a very, very short, or no, memory, Davis said. Weve got a community that is not quite as concerned or enlightened or cares much about what happens in these kinds of incidents.

But she added that Teaneck also has something important going for it: a history of confronting its problems.

Moving on

It took more than 20 years, but Natacha Pannell learned to cope with her brothers death.

She sought grief counseling. She practiced yoga. She started a youth service organization, Corner to Corner Community Empowerment. She enrolled in graduate school. She became active in the Black Lives Matter protest movement, and began advocating for improved relationships between police and young people. I started realizing that I dont want to live my life like this anymore, she said. I dont want to live my life hating police officers. I dont want to live my life hating white people. I dont want to live my life being angry ... I want to be able to move on in my life, to be happy about something.

Her mother noticed the change, and agreed to get counseling herself. Last year, they shared their story at a Black Lives Matter event near Teaneck. As they walked from the podium, the song Spread My Wings by Troop came on. It was Phillips favorite song in early 1990. Natacha started dancing. She told Thelma it was a sign that he approved.

The family is not healed. Natachas father lives in a nursing home, hobbled by a stroke and diabetes. He weeps when someone brings up his son. But Natacha believes theyre on the right path.

Sometimes, people ask her advice on recovering from trauma. She tells them: Whatever happened to you, thats not who you are. It doesnt define who you are. Only you can define who you are.

msnbc.com,,Who does Wall Street want to be president?,['Brian Price'],"Famed investor Byron Wien of Blackrock, who previously spent 21 years at Morgan Stanley, voiced major concerns when it comes to Donald Trump potential ascension to the White House.

Donald Trump is attacking Mexico, hes attacking pretty much all of Europe, hes attacking the Muslim religion and hes not denounced the Klu Klux Klan, noted Wien.

It has been, so far, a difficult year. I think it will be a down year, and I didnt [initially] anticipate Donald Trumps ascendency, but hell contribute to that, the investor added.

Economists on both the left and right have had choice words for Trumps controversial positions on trade and immigration. Some think his threat to slap tariffs on China could lead to a trade war, or even a global recession. Wien also faulted the billionaire real estate moguls plans on trade, which could isolate the U.S. economy from major trading partners.

Joseph Grano, who as a key figure in the merger between UBS and PaineWebber and now works as Chairman and CEO of Centurion Holdings, echoed Wiens concerns.

Donalds got to show us some depth, warned Grano, who also served as Chairman of the Homeland Security Advisory Council. If he doesnt start acting more presidential, and tone down the hyperbole and the rhetoric, he may get the [GOP] nomination, but I dont think he can win the presidency.

Grano also warned that, given Trumps approach to diplomacy and taxes, that the S&P 500 could drop by 20 percent if he were to be elected president. With this in mind, Grano backed the candidacy of Ohio governor John Kasich.

What would be good for the government and good for the country: Kasich, explained Grano. Hes a survivor with the best track record and the highest level of pragmatism.

Another point of view was expressed by Asher Edelman, who spent 30 year on Wall Street buying and selling distressed companies. After leaving finance, he established Edelman Arts in New York City to focus on the secondary art market.

When considering the candidates, Edelman didnt hesitate to acknowledge that hes supportive of Senator Bernie Sanders, who is challenging former Secrertary of State Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.

Bernie is the only person out there who I think is talking at all about fiscal stimulation and banking rules that will get the banks to begin to generate lending again, as opposed to speculation, said Edelman. He addedthat Sanders will ultimately bring more buying power to the masses.

Edelman emphasized that the middle class, when armed with funds, have a greater impact on the U.S. economy than the richest individuals in the country.

When you have the top one percent getting money, they spend five-ten percent of what they earn. When you have the lower end of the economy getting money, they spend a hundred, or a hundred and ten percent of what they earn. As youve had a transfer of wealth to the top, and a transfer of income to the top, you have a shrinking consumer base, he said.

Abby Joseph Cohen began her career as an economist with the Federal Reserve after graduating from Cornell. Soon after, she joined Goldman Sachs in 1990, earned the title of Managing Director in 1996 and then became a partner in 1998.

Cohen, who rose to prominence with her bullish predictions during the 1990s bull market, explained that a key issue for the next president is comprehensive tax reform

Were looking for who is proposing the policies that address the underlying issues in the U.S. economy including the disappointing movement in median family income, the need for more robust jobs creation and also the [ongoing] improvement in U.S. innovation and competitiveness, she told CNBC.

Cohen cited data from the Tax Foundation and The Tax Policy Center as think tanks that have crunched the available data from all the candidates. According to the Tax Foundation, Secretary Clintons plan would bring in an estimated $498 billion over 10 years on a static revenue. Bernie Sanders plan would lead to an estimated $13.5 trillion, however GDP growth under his plan would be -18.6 percent.

By comparison, Secretary Clintons 10-year GDP growth would be -1.0 percent. Trumps plan would lead to 11.5 percent GDP surge over 10 years, but would cause nearly $12 trillion in losses in static revenue over the course of a decade.

Bottom Line: [Secretary] Clinton seems to have the most fulsome proposal thats been made thus far, Cohen said.

msnbc.com,,Hillary Clinton: 'I made a mistake' on the Reagans' HIV/AIDS legacy,[],"On Saturday, Hillary Clinton apologized at length for her remarks earlier in the week on Ronald and Nancy Reagan and their legacy on HIV and AIDS, calling her comments a mistake, plain and simple.

At former First Lady Nancy Reagans funeral, Clinton told MSNBCs Andrea Mitchell that the couple started a national conversation about the epidemic, prompting a swift backlash.

RELATED: Clinton apologizes for praising Nancy Reagans HIV/AIDS legacy

It may be hard for your viewers to remember how difficult it was for people to talk about HIV/AIDS back in the 1980s, Clinton told Mitchell. And because of both President and Mrs. Reagan  in particular, Mrs. Reagan  we started a national conversation when before no one would talk about it, no one wanted to do anything about it. And that too is something that I really appreciate, with her very effective, low-key advocacy, but it penetrated the public conscience, and people began to say, Hey, we have to do something about this, too.

Many found Clintons assertion problematic, and it revived criticisms of the Reagan administrations policies on drugs and response to the public health crisis. The presidential candidate later said she misspoke in a statement released hours after the interview.

Hillary Clintons statement on her comments about the Reagans record on HIV and AIDS: pic.twitter.com/RtIs0zpJfk  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 11, 2016

Clinton addressed her critics in greater detail in a post on the blog-publishing platform Medium on Saturday evening.

Yesterday, at Nancy Reagans funeral, I said something inaccurate when speaking about the Reagans record on HIV and AIDS, Clinton wrote. Since then, Ive heard from countless people who were devastated by the loss of friends and loved ones, and hurt and disappointed by what I said. As someone who has also lost friends and loved ones to AIDS, I understand why. I made a mistake, plain and simple.

The former secretary of state then attributed the discourse surrounding the epidemic to activists and advocates who raised awareness about HIV and AIDS and invoked the mantra that silence ultimately equates to resigning to death.

To be clear, the Reagans did not start a national conversation about HIV and AIDS, the post continued. That distinction belongs to generations of brave lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, along with straight allies, who started not just a conversation but a movement that continues to this day.

Clinton then delineated her policy platforms on health care, drugs, HIV and AIDS.

For the first time, an AIDS-free generation is in sight, Clinton said. As president, I promise you that I will not let up until we reach that goal. We will not leave anyone behind.",[]
msnbc.com,,Kasich says 'it's tough' when asked if he would support Trump as nominee,[],"Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, responded to increasing tensions at opponent Donald Trumps rallies and was pressed on whether he will support Trump if he wins the Republican nomination. He responded, Its tough, I mean, but hes not going to be the nominee.

Over the weekend, Kasich said Trump was getting close to disqualifying himself from the nomination. Lets see what happens, Kasich told Chuck Todd on NBCs Meet the Press when asked what it would take for Trump to disqualify himself.

The Ohio governor further lamented the tone of the Trump campaign:

Everything is negative. Everything is, Americas losing, and were terrible. I mean, come on. Look, weve got our challenges. People are worried about the security of their job, theyre worried about the wages, theyre worried about not getting any interest in the bank, theyre worried about their kids future.

Looking ahead to Tuesdays contests, Kasich - who leads Trump by 6 points in his home state - assured supporters, Im going to win Ohio with the great support, I hope, of the Ohio folks here.

Sen. Marco Rubios campaign has encouraged supporters in Ohio to back Kasich if their goal is to defeat Donald Trump. Questioned on if he would ask his supporters in Florida to do the same, Kasich demurred. My voters are not like robots where I can say, Go do something, OK? How do you run for office and tell people to vote for somebody else? the Ohio governor said.

But would Kasich like to see Rubio win Florida? Id like to win Florida, he protested, but I dont see that its in the cards. Kasich also said he called Sen. Rubio to wish him luck in the Sunshine State, but was not able to reach him.

Asked if his team is coordinating with the other Republican campaigns in an effort to deny Trump delegates, Kasich responded: No, no. Im not...if its going on, Im unaware of it.

Finally, on his own electoral chances going forward, Kasich assured supporters, Dont be surprised if I go to the convention with the largest number of delegates. He concluded that it is likely there will be some sort of multi-ballot convention, but, he continued, You never know in politics...whats true today is not necessarily true tomorrow.

msnbc.com,,A wave of Puerto Rican migration could make Florida a Democratic stronghold,[],"ORLANDO, Fla.  Back home in Puerto Rico, Jeamy Ramirez grew up feeling a strong social pressure to register to vote on the day she turned 18. But once she moved to the mainland, among the hundreds of Puerto Ricans to make the jump to central Florida each month, Ramirez noticed a stark cultural shift  few bothered to register, let alone cast a vote.

In the midst of a massive migration wave from the Caribbean, Puerto Ricans are on pace to outnumber Floridas Cuban population, which for generations dominated all Hispanic groups in the Sunshine State.

Their involvement in the political process stands to dramatically reshape electoral outcomes  Cubans consistently vote Republican, while Puerto Ricans tend to lean Democratic. But this burgeoning power from within the Latino voting bloc hinges on one key detail  whether Puerto Ricans would actually register and turn out.

Imagine if we all together go out and vote, Ramirez, 37, said. We can make a lot of changes. Close video GOP candidates focus on Cuba at debate Buzzfeeds Adrian Carrasquillo and Politicos Marc Caputo join MSNBCs Jose Diaz-Balart to discuss how Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz handled the debate questions regarding the U.S. diplomatic relations with Cuba. embed like save share group

More than 1 million people have resettled to the heart of Florida in recent years to escape Puerto Ricos dire opportunities and financial turmoil. And as US citizens by birth, Puerto Ricans become easy targets for both parties to pad their voting rolls once the newcomers move to the mainland.

There are signs that the massive migration wave is set to have lasting benefits for the Democratic Party. Hispanics account for 88 percent of growth in Democratic voters in Florida over the last decade, according to the Pew Research Center. Democrats now hold a voter registration advantage over Republicans with Florida Latinos. And the diverse demographics are only expected to grow.

These communities are popping up in crucial voting districts, dotting neighborhoods along the I-4 corridor, which consistently determines which way the state will swing in any given election.

The number of Puerto Ricans living in Florida is not only rivaling the Cuban population, its almost equal, said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic research at Pew. Its potentially a swing vote area because of this growing population of Puerto Ricans.

Holding them back, however, are low levels of engagement once they reach Florida. They leave behind a dramatically different party system and voting process  Puerto Ricans vote every four years but are unable to participate in US general elections. Among newcomers who have only recently moved to central Florida, few are familiar with the parties or candidates.

RELATED: Immigration turning point for Clinton and Sanders hits just before Florida primary

Many have no idea. They say, Hillary who? Or Democrat what? said Neil Rios, 18, a volunteer canvasser with the national nonprofit group Mi Familia Vota.

The disparity between voter participation back home and on the mainland has advocates like Maribel Hastings, a Puerto Rican native and senior adviser with Americas Voice, scratching their heads to explain why so few choose to approach voting in the states with same sense of duty.

In Puerto Rico, we have one of the highest voter participations in the country, Hastings explained. Once they move to the mainland, they dont vote. Its really hard to get them registered and get them out and vote.

Organizations like Mi Familia Vota, which focuses on helping immigrant communities obtain citizenship and register to vote, caught a break this year with a presidential election cycle that has consistently captured the attention of people worldwide.

Donald Trumps candidacy  and his consistently inflammatory rhetoric designed to scapegoat minority communities  has led to the unintended consequence of boosting voter rolls and citizenship tests with immigrants dead set against seeing the reality TV star become president.

Weve heard everything from I want to become a citizen because I dont want Trump to win, said Maria Ponce, a spokesperson for the pro-immigrant group iAmerica. That has been the constant item that we have been hearing from many, many Latinos.

Ramirez, who canvases supermarkets, neighborhoods and schools in the Orlando area, noticed the same: People are more willing to register to vote if there is a candidate they fear. But increasingly, Puerto Ricans are choosing to register as unaffiliated with any party.

Its a growing trend for Hispanics to reject party alignment  according to Pew, more Hispanics are unaffiliated than those registered as Republicans. While it means that voters can keep their options open for the general election, it also means that unaffiliated Latinos wont be able to participate in Floridas March 15 primary.

Standing outside a supermarket in Orlando, where shes lived since 2012, Ramirez was making a last ditch-effort to reach new potential voters so they could participate in the contest on Tuesday.

Today is a good day, she said as she counted the stack of filled-out forms. More than 20 new registrations in a little over an hour.

msnbc.com,,"Donald Trump warns Sanders: 'Be careful, Bernie'",[],"Donald Trump maintained his attack on Bernie Sanders Sunday after accusing the Vermont senators campaign of organizing protests that shut down a Trump rally in Chicago on Friday.

Trumps charge took an even more controversial turn on Sunday morning, when he said on Twitter, Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!

Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors arent told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2016

Sanders was asked Sunday on CNN about Trumps tweet.

We should take Mr. Trumps words with a grain of salt, because I think as almost everybody knows, this man cannot stop lying about anything ... to talk about our organization or our campaign disrupting his meeting is a lie, Sanders said. Some of them were supporters of mine, but certainly, absolutely, we had nothing to do, our campaign had nothing to do with disrupting his meeting.

Sanders continued to say that Trumps rhetoric has fostered environments that are conducive to violent clashes.

Even his Republican colleagues make this point. His language, his intonations. When he talks about carrying people out in stretchers. When you see at his rallies, people sucker-punch folks. People kick people when theyre down. This is a man who keeps implying violence, and then you end up getting what you see, Sanders said. So I think that he in fact has got to tell his supporters that in the United States of America, you dont go beating up people. That people have a right to peacefully protest, and I hope that becomes the tone of his campaign.

Trump took to Twitter on Saturday to blame organized thugs who shut down our First Amendment rights for the violent clashes that led to his Chicago rally being closed down. Fights broke out between supporters and protesters before Trump even spoke at the event.

The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2016

Five people were arrested and two officers were injured, according to Chicago police. One of the injured officers was struck by a bottle and received a bloody gash that required stitches, police said.

Violence also ensued at a North Carolina rally earlier in the week. A Trump supporter was charged with assault for punching a protester. Videos show the protester being escorted out by law enforcement when the supporter hit him. Close video Clinton on violence at Trump rally Hillary Clinton says shes truly distraught over the violence that occurred during a Donald Trump campaign rally. Trump also talked about the incident during Thursdays debate. embed like save share group

Political figures from both sides of the aisle condemned Trumps rhetoric and insisted campaigns should bear responsibility for the environments they create.

I know that everybody in public life gets protested against and sometimes people do need to be removed, but it should be done in an appropriate manner, Clinton said on MSNBC. Other people in the audience should not be joining in. Mr. Trump should not be urging people on.

Sanders also condemned Trumps rhetoric in a statement released Saturday. Donald Trump is showing the American people that he is a pathological liar. Obviously, while I appreciate that we had supporters at Trumps rally in Chicago, our campaign did not organize the protests, he said. What Donald Trump must do now is stop provoking violence.

It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2016

Trump dismissed the calls to adjust his tone, calling Clinton and Sanders phony politicians on Twitter. He also negated his fellow Republicans concerns about violence, saying on CNN that they are running against me, they are losing big league.

While Trump told NBCs Chuck Todd that he does not condone violence at his events, he said that he would not take responsibility for the atmosphere of his rallies. In the interview on Meet the Press Sunday, the GOP front-runner said he would even look into paying the legal fees of the man who threw the punch at his rally in North Carolina.

I have no objection to what I said, Trump said of his past rhetoric at rallies. I would say it again.",[]
msnbc.com,,Lessons of Teaneck: Town's journey from riot to redemption after cop shooting,['Jon Schuppe'],"TEANECK, N.J.  The teenager had a pistol in his pocket, and when the cops came, he bolted.

They chased him into a backyard. He stopped and began to turn. One of the officers, fearing he would shoot, fired his service revolver.

The 16-year-old victim was black. The officer was white. And that gunshot, fired nearly 26 years ago, sparked a cataclysm.

It marked the end of a life, a career and a communitys idealism. It took a terrible toll on the teens family, and on the officer, who withdrew for more than two decades before breaking his silence last week.

But the aftershock also opened a long path to healing that remains relevant today, as a wave of unrest over police killings has swept the country, cleaving communities and raising thorny questions about Americas relationship with law enforcement.

TEANECK STILL STRUGGLES TO MAINTAIN RACIAL AND ETHNIC UNITY, BUT THE TOWN NOW STANDS AS A POSSIBLE LESSON FOR PLACES LIKE FERGUSON, NORTH CHARLESTON, CLEVELAND, BALTIMORE.

The crisis unfolded in Teaneck, a small suburb five miles from New York City long considered a model of racial harmony. Decades earlier, the township had fought block-busting, a ploy by real-estate speculators to induce fear of black homeowners, and had voluntarily integrated its schools, telling the world it welcomed newcomers of all faiths and shades.

Beneath that equanimity, however, was a festering resentment over the predominantly white police forces treatment of blacks. The bullet that pierced the boys heart shattered the facade.

That fatal encounter transformed Teaneck from a symbol of unity into one of intolerance, and plunged it into a long period of self-examination, and, eventually, recovery.

The journey remains unfinished. But Teaneck stands as a possible lesson for communities still roiling from recent police shootings: Ferguson, North Charleston, Cleveland, Baltimore, Chicago.

Trouble in a model town

This wasnt supposed to happen in Teaneck. The township seemed to have it all: neat neighborhoods of single-family homes, a stable commercial district, solid schools. Decades earlier, the Army Corps of Engineers had picked Teaneck  believed to be named after a Native American term for villages  as an archetype of small-town America. But what made this place special in 1990 was its fiercely cultivated image of harmonious multiculturalism.

A quarter of Teanecks 38,000 residents were black, many enticed across the Hudson River from New York to pursue middle-class lives. Another third were Jewish. Many minorities were concentrated in small areas, but the mix made most people proud.

Phillip Pannells family moved to Teaneck chasing that middle-class dream. But his father, Phillip Sr., struggled with drugs and alcohol, which spun him into a cycle of unemployment and jail that broke the family apart. Phillip, meanwhile, was getting into fights with kids from neighboring Englewood, part of an old rivalry between the towns. The situation worsened when his mother, Thelma, moved him and his younger sister there. As a new student in Englewood, Phillip became a target.

Friends and family said Phillip felt threatened. That, they said, probably explained why, on April 10, 1990, he was carrying a beat-up starters pistol, converted to hold bullets, that hed found among his mothers things.

Early that evening, a man called Teaneck police and said hed seen a boy with a gun among kids in a schoolyard. Two officers responded. One of them was Gary Spath, 29, who was born and raised in town and had followed his father onto the force.

He chased Phillip behind a house. In a quick confrontation, Spath opened fire, hitting Pannell in the back.

Some witnesses said the teen appeared to be surrendering. Spath believed otherwise.

He had a gun in his pocket and he was going to shoot me, he later testified.

Upheaval

Pannells death split residents into camps: those who believed Spath acted properly in response to a grave threat, and those who saw it as the culmination of years of harassment by biased cops. The day after the shooting, a group of black youths overturned police cars and broke shop windows. The national media showed up.

This really opened the eyes of people, said Theodora Lacey, a civil rights leader and retired teacher. There were these sweet young people who had grown up in an integrated setting. So it was just seemingly contrary to what we thought we were teaching and bringing about through integration  that you could have a young, white cop shoot and kill.

The marches began: college students one day, local and out-of-town activists the next, cops on another. They went on for years as the case progressed through the legal system  a grand jurys decision not to indict Spath, claims of a botched autopsy, a second that concluded bullet holes showed Pannells hands were in the air, a new grand jurys charging Spath with manslaughter and, finally, Spaths 1992 acquittal by an all-white jury.

In 1994, Pannells family settled a civil rights lawsuit against Teaneck for nearly $200,000. The U.S. Justice Department decided against a criminal case. Eventually, the calls for justice subsided.

But not the soul-searching.

From the first sign of unrest, Teaneck leaders began organizing community meetings, tapping into a long tradition of consensus-building that had helped the township through prior crises, including a 1964 school integration fight. At these forums, students, police, elected officials and civil-rights activists confronted their differences on a range of issues: the distrust between cops and blacks, the dearth of minorities in the police department, institutional racism in the schools, white flight, falling home values. Many whites were surprised to hear blacks complaints of everyday racist treatment.

It became clear that while their township was integrated, the people of Teaneck didnt truly know each other.

A sisters despair

Natacha Pannell was 13 when she accompanied her mother to Holy Name Hospital and watched doctors pull back the sheet that covered Phillips body. Thelma fell to the table; Natacha picked grass out of her older brothers hair.

They didnt see the body again for several weeks, at a wake that drew hundreds, including dozens of Phillips former classmates as well as firebrand ministers Al Sharpton and Louis Farrakhan. Clergy and activists placed his death on a national list of black and Hispanic people killed by white police officers.

Natachas mother withdrew in grief. Her father joined the protesters. Natacha, desperate to understand Phillips death, joined him.

I felt like through marches and things like that, that I was going to be closer  closer to the truth, or closer to the reason why he wasnt with me anymore, Natacha, now 39, recalled.

The answers didnt come easily.

On the surface, Natacha seemed to do OK. She graduated high school and college, had a son, and went into community-service work. But she felt out of step with the world: picked on, angry, distrustful.

She and her mother grew distant. Her father, whod gotten clean after Phillips death, returned to alcohol, and for a time was homeless.

Natacha wrestled with guilt. In the weeks before the shooting, shed seen Phillip looking for the old starters pistol. She told him where it was, but made him promise to never take it. For years, I felt like it was my fault, she said.

It would take decades to forgive herself.

Its a horrible thing

Gary Spath, a married father of young children, was suspended with pay after the shooting. Protesters accused him of racism. Jesse Jackson called him an executioner. The media examined his service record, and found several commendations but also prior incidents in which hed fired his weapon without hitting anyone. Spaths supporters rallied to his side, but the officer himself did not speak publicly, quietly enduring what he later described as a living hell.

When the jury acquitted him two years later, Spath held his wife, Nancy, in a long embrace and wept, while Thelma Pannell was escorted from the courtroom, wailing. Afterward, he said his family was praying the Pannells would find peace. He retired on an accidental disability pension, for which he received monthly payments of $3,622.

Spath held odd jobs and considered a return to police work. But he and his wife finally decided that the only way to rebuild their lives was to leave. They moved their three children to the eastern tip of Long Island, New York, where he found work in school security.

For a long time, Spath was angry and bitter at having been cast as a racist, trigger-happy cop. Those feelings subsided, but returned whenever he saw his name resurface in local coverage of a police shooting, or a racially charged issue.

His breaking point came in August 2014, when Ferguson, Missouri erupted in riots following a white police officers fatal shooting of a black teenager. He saw a lot of similarities with his experience, and was maddened by new mentions of his name in the press. He began to feel the need to tell his story.

ITS WITH ME EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE. BUT I KEEP GOING FORWARD. - Gary Spath

In a brief interview with NBC News, Spath, now 55 and a grandfather, said he would never get over taking Phillip Pannells life, but didnt regret what he did, because the teen posed an immediate danger.

As right as I was in the eyes of the law, Im a human being, and its a horrible thing that happened, Spath said. But I dont think I could have responded in any other way.

He broke his public silence on Wednesday, when he appeared as the keynote speaker at a police union convention in Atlantic City. In a Caesars banquet hall, Spath shared what its like to be the white officer who kills a young black person.

Growing up in Teaneck felt straight out of Norman Rockwell painting, he said. But the shootings aftermath taught him about the brutal intersection of race and politics. He described the second grand jury as a witch hunt, recalled out-of-town protesters as thugs, and said the media crucified me.

Today, he said, his best memories were not of the guts and glory aspects of police work but of playing stickball with kids, shoveling someones driveway, changing a tire. Those are the things I miss most, he said.

Spath credited his wife for keeping him together, saying his life was nothing short of a miracle. Doing positive things helped  to an extent.

My shooting will never go away, he said. Its with me every day of my life. But I keep moving forward. I take each day as it comes.

Reckoning

Paul Tiernan was a lieutenant in the Teaneck Police Department, studying for a masters in criminal justice when Pannell was shot. His research focused on community policing. Most of the early programs were used in high-crime urban neighborhoods, but Tiernan saw potential in the increasingly diverse American suburbs, including his own.

Tiernan saw a link between Teanecks troubles and an enforcement-driven police strategy that dominated in the years leading up to the Pannell shooting. The approach, driven by ticket quotas, made residents  especially blacks  feel that officers were always trying to catch them doing something wrong. Those grievances fueled the post-shooting unrest, which in turn decimated morale among police officers, who couldnt understand why the community didnt support them. Teaneck officers still recall being heckled for years with shouts of, Dont shoot me!

In early 1994, the department adopted Tiernans proposal. Officers went door to door handing out surveys and introducing themselves. They hosted community meetings and set up neighborhood watch programs. They held civilian training academies to show people what it was like to be a cop. They learned how to handle touchy situations with more sensitivity.

There had been a total break with the community, and then we got everyone talking to each other, Tiernan recalled. The program was regarded as a success, and got Tiernan appointed chief in 2003.

Similar efforts were underway elsewhere in town. The school district worked to resolve complaints that black students were being marginalized. The township built a new recreation center for kids who otherwise had few after-school opportunities. In homes and houses of worship, residents discussed the townships racial divisions.

Gradually, Teaneck regained control of its journey.

We found that if we spoke to one another ... looked each other in the eye and understood each others perspective, there was more civility, more respect for one another, said Paul Ostrow, who was elected to the Township Council a few weeks after the shooting. You just had to pick the right adjectives. And rather than picking hate, mistrust, separate, we picked understand, get together, rebuild.

I believe in this town

Shawn Robinson counted Phillip Pannell as his friend. He was 14 at the time of the shooting and lived across the street from the house where it occurred. At that time, nothing like that had happened in our neighborhood, or to me, he recalled. I was hurt. Traumatized.

For a long time, Robinson said, he had a hard time trusting police. But he didnt hold grudges against them, or white people. He credits Teaneck for that.

I always had white friends, Hispanic friends, Robinson said. I still have friends of different backgrounds, and that really comes from our upbringing, and how the town handled (the shooting). They didnt push hate on us.

IM PROUD OF THE WAY WE HANDLED IT, IN TERMS OF BROTHERHOOD AND MANKIND. I BELIEVE IN THE TOWN. - Shawn Robinson

Teaneck, he said, can show the country how to move forward.

We didnt get the justice that we were seeking, but Im proud of the way we handled it, in terms of brotherhood and mankind, Robinson said. I believe in the town.

Teaneck still touts itself as a little United Nations. The mayor is a black woman. The township council includes a black, a Muslim and an Orthodox Jew. The black population has remained about the same since 1990, while many whites have left and been replaced with Hispanics. More than a third of teachers, and about 14 percent of police, are minorities.

An officer hasnt shot someone since Pannells death, police say. The community policing bureau was discontinued in 2010, then resurrected in a more modest format.

As tragic as the event was, something good did come out of it, said Robert Carney, who was a young officer on the night of the Pannell shooting and is now the police chief. Theres a better relationship and understanding between the community and Police Department.

But many worry that Teaneck has grown complacent. With the influx of Orthodox Jews, many of whom send their children to private schools, and the departure of other whites, the public schools have become 87 percent non-white. That leaves fewer opportunities for residents of different backgrounds to know each other. Two years ago, parents accused the police of overreacting to a prank in which 63 students, many of them black, were arrested for vandalizing the high school, drawing national headlines.

Allison Davis, a former NBC News journalist who now runs an arts advocacy organization, said the generation of residents who lived through integration and the Pannell shooting are moving away or dying.

And so what weve got now is a community with a very, very short, or no, memory, Davis said. Weve got a community that is not quite as concerned or enlightened or cares much about what happens in these kinds of incidents.

But she added that Teaneck also has something important going for it: a history of confronting its problems.

Moving on

It took more than 20 years, but Natacha Pannell learned to cope with her brothers death.

She sought grief counseling. She practiced yoga. She started a youth service organization, Corner to Corner Community Empowerment. She enrolled in graduate school. She became active in the Black Lives Matter protest movement, and began advocating for improved relationships between police and young people. I started realizing that I dont want to live my life like this anymore, she said. I dont want to live my life hating police officers. I dont want to live my life hating white people. I dont want to live my life being angry ... I want to be able to move on in my life, to be happy about something.

Her mother noticed the change, and agreed to get counseling herself. Last year, they shared their story at a Black Lives Matter event near Teaneck. As they walked from the podium, the song Spread My Wings by Troop came on. It was Phillips favorite song in early 1990. Natacha started dancing. She told Thelma it was a sign that he approved.

The family is not healed. Natachas father lives in a nursing home, hobbled by a stroke and diabetes. He weeps when someone brings up his son. But Natacha believes theyre on the right path.

Sometimes, people ask her advice on recovering from trauma. She tells them: Whatever happened to you, thats not who you are. It doesnt define who you are. Only you can define who you are.

The blast, which local media attributed to a car bomb, occurred on the citys main boulevard, Ataturk Bulvari, close to Ankaras main square, Kizilay.

The private NTV news channel said a car, believed to be laden with explosives, detonated close to a bus.

Several vehicles then caught fire, the station said. The area is close to government offices, including ministries.

The deadly explosion  the third in the city in five months  came just three weeks after a suicide car bombing in the capital targeted buses carrying military personnel, killing 29 people.

A Kurdish militant group which is an offshoot of the outlawed Kurdish rebel group, the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, claimed responsibility for the Feb. 17 attack.

Donald Trump is running a cynical campaign of hate and fear for one reason, to get votes, Clinton said at a dinner event hosted by the Ohio Democratic Party. Donald Trump is not who we are.

After a weekend marked by violence at Trump rallies across the Midwest, Clinton said the blame lays squarely with the candidate himself. Trump encourages his supporters to beat up anybody who disagrees with him, she said.

And Clinton used her attacks on Trump to make an implicit contrast with Bernie Sanders, whose supporters have helped organize anti-Trump protests, including the one that shut down a rally in Chicago Friday night. We can criticize and protest Donald Trump all we want, but none of that matters if we dont also show up at the polls. If you want to shut him down, then lets vote him down, she said.

RELATED: Trump warns Sanders: Be careful, Bernie

Later in the evening, at town hall hosted by CNN, Clinton said she would campaign against Trump in the general election by emphasizing the damage he would do to Americas standing in the world. Im having foreign leaders ask if they can endorse me to stop Donald Trump, Clinton said, though she declined to name names.

Sanders appeared at both the dinner and town hall but stuck almost entirely to his talking points. But when asked to name a Republican he gets along with, Sanders mentioned Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, one of the most conservative members of the Senate who is also its most strident climate change denier. Inhofe and Sanders have known friendship, despite their ideological differences.

Meanwhile, at both events, Clinton stiffened her position on free trade agreements, an emotional issue in a state that has lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs.

I will stop, dead in its tracks, any trade deal that hurts America or American workers, Clinton said at the dinner.

Clinton also spoke about the death penalty after taking an emotional question from from a former death row inmate who was released from prison after a court ruled he had been falsely convicted. This is such a profoundly difficult question, Clinton said, explaining that she opposes capital punishment in all but the most extreme circumstances.",[]

Vashey is undecided and likes some of Trumps platform, such as his pledge to build a border wall and crack down on drug smugglers, but said he was concerned by his tone.

After serving two tours in Afghanistan with the Marines, he thought Trumps proposed ban on Muslims entering the country distorted the beautiful religion he encountered abroad and heightened tensions.

His directive appeals to me, but not his rhetoric, Vashey said. Its too built up toward hatred.

Decked out in wraparound shades and a worn baseball cap, 45-year old Bill Scott said he registered Republican to vote for Trump this week because hes saying what all of us want to say. He said supporters have had enough of protestors from the Black Lives Matter movement and other left-wing causes.

Were going to react how we react regardless of what Trump says, he said. Obama created this mess. Ive seen people grab flags, throw punches they start trouble.

Trump rallies have had a familiar, if deeply unsettling, rhythm up to this point: Cops and security would weed out suspected protestors before the event started. The individuals who made it in would interrupt the speech and then be escorted out while Trump fired up the crowd with taunts, jeers and sometimes a sneering, dont hurt them. Hopefully, no one would get hurt.

That hope is dwindling. On Saturday, a protestor charged Trumps podium on Saturday. On Friday, a Chicago rally was canceled amid clashes between protestors and Trump supporters. Last week, a protestor was punched in North Carolina and Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields issued a criminal complaint against Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandoski for grabbing her (Lewandoski denies the charge).

Where it ends, no one can be sure. Julys Republican National Convention in Cleveland, which could feature a heated floor fight inside and tens of thousands of protestors outside, feels more and more like a ticking bomb waiting to go off.

In the meantime, Trump is alternating between passing condemnations of violence paired with blatant celebrations of it. On Sunday, he said on NBCs Meet The Press that he was considering paying legal bills for the 78-year old supporter who was arrested for sucker-punching a black protestor on camera. He tweeted that Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders, who Trump blames for the protestors at his rallies, needed to be careful or hed send his supporters to disrupt his events. Some activist groups supporting Sanders participated in the Chicago protests, but Sanders has said his own campaign had nothing to do with them and called on Trump to condemn violence.

[My] personality, eh, they dont love it so much but thats okay, Trump told the crowd in Boca Raton on Sunday after arriving in a helicopter. Who cares? Who the hell cares about that? We got to straighten out our country.

Before his speech, cops formed a wall outside the amphitheater as several young, mostly black men and women in keffiyeh and t-shirts with social justice slogans approached the gate. A cop explained that the campaign had identified them and asked to prevent their entire group from going inside even if they had tickets.

They dont want you here on the property, the officer said, directing them to a designated protest area outside.

So shes black and shes wearing something on her head and she has tickets and youre not letting her in? a twenty-something blond white man asked.

Where did you hear me say that? the officer said.

What if I have tickets? the man said. Im here to protest and I have tickets.

Okay, the cop said, waving him in.

So he gets to go in? a short woman in a red and white headscarf said.

The woman was Jasmen Rogers, 26, an activist with the Black Lives Matter Alliance of Broward County. She held up Popsicle sticks with cardboard hearts that said Love Trumps Hate that she said her group had planned to distribute to Trump voters inside.

It makes me feel like we havent progressed much beyond the hoses and the dogs, Rogers told reporters. Thats the America that Trump wants to make great again.

Escorted by a dozen officers, Rogers and her group of protestors made their way to the edge of the venue where they played drums and sang songs. The circus-like scene outside attracted tourists along with activists  there was a teenager with a Baba Booey sign hoping to attract Howard Sterns attention and a student in a college sweatshirt who told MSNBC they attended the event ironically.

Inside the amphitheater, speaker Laura Wilkerson told the crowd how an undocumented immigrant murdered her teenage son in 2010. Trump often features speakers who have lost family members to criminals in the country illegally.

This was our familys 9/11 terrorist attack by a foreign invader, she said. The American government has failed to do its job in protecting American citizens.

As she finished her speech, commotion broke out toward the front as protestors were led out.

Build the wall! Build the wall! Build the wall! the crowd chanted in response. Kick them out! Kick them out! Kick them out!

The early outburst seemed to clear out most of the protestors by the time Trump arrived, who was mostly uninterrupted except for a small group. A man screamed, Trumps a racist! as he was escorted out. Trump, perhaps not seeing him, said nothing.

msnbc.com,,"Hillary Clinton tees off on Trump, toughens stance on trade",[],"COLUMBUS, Ohio  Hillary Clinton teed off on Donald Trump and hardened her stance on free trade agreements Sunday night, zeroing in on two issues that have dominated the contest ahead of the states Democratic presidential primary contest Tuesday.

Donald Trump is running a cynical campaign of hate and fear for one reason, to get votes, Clinton said at a dinner event hosted by the Ohio Democratic Party. Donald Trump is not who we are.

After a weekend marked by violence at Trump rallies across the Midwest, Clinton said the blame lays squarely with the candidate himself. Trump encourages his supporters to beat up anybody who disagrees with him, she said.

And Clinton used her attacks on Trump to make an implicit contrast with Bernie Sanders, whose supporters have helped organize anti-Trump protests, including the one that shut down a rally in Chicago Friday night. We can criticize and protest Donald Trump all we want, but none of that matters if we dont also show up at the polls. If you want to shut him down, then lets vote him down, she said.

RELATED: Trump warns Sanders: Be careful, Bernie

Later in the evening, at town hall hosted by CNN, Clinton said she would campaign against Trump in the general election by emphasizing the damage he would do to Americas standing in the world. Im having foreign leaders ask if they can endorse me to stop Donald Trump, Clinton said, though she declined to name names.

Sanders appeared at both the dinner and town hall but stuck almost entirely to his talking points. But when asked to name a Republican he gets along with, Sanders mentioned Oklahoma Sen. Jim Inhofe, one of the most conservative members of the Senate who is also its most strident climate change denier. Inhofe and Sanders have known friendship, despite their ideological differences.

Meanwhile, at both events, Clinton stiffened her position on free trade agreements, an emotional issue in a state that has lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs.

I will stop, dead in its tracks, any trade deal that hurts America or American workers, Clinton said at the dinner.

Clinton also spoke about the death penalty after taking an emotional question from from a former death row inmate who was released from prison after a court ruled he had been falsely convicted. This is such a profoundly difficult question, Clinton said, explaining that she opposes capital punishment in all but the most extreme circumstances.",[]

msnbc.com,,Why Trump wants Pete Rose to go to bat for him,[],"Editors note: This piece has been updated to include comment from Pete Roses representative.

Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has enjoyed the support of professional athletes in the past  including former Yankees greats Johnny Damon and Paul ONeill, but no endorsement from the sports world may be more strategically beneficial to him than the one he covets from embattled former Cincinnati Reds star Pete Rose.

The 74-year-old Rose has been banned from the game of baseball since 1989 for violating Major League rules by regularly gambling on the sport. For decades Rose denied that he had bet on baseball, finally admitting guilt in a 2004 memoir My Prison Without Bars. He later acknowledged that he bet on games he managed, and several reports have alleged that he also gambled on games in which he played, although to this day he maintains that he only bet on his teams to win.

Still, despite his protestations, as recently as last December, the MLBs commissioner decided not to reinstate him, which effectively also continued a ban on consideration for Hall of Fame induction.

RELATED: Report: Pete Rose bet on baseball when he was still a player

Rose has been vilified in many circles for his persistent equivocating on the gambling issue, but he still garners widespread support in Ohio, where he spent his most celebrated years as a player for the Cincinnati Reds, which won two World Series titles during his tenure with the team. Rose is the MLBs all-time leader in hits and he earned the endearing nickname Charlie Hustle for being one of the scrappiest baseball stars, if not the most physically gifted. He also has cultivated a regular guy, blue-collar persona, which has made him both a folk hero and cause celebre in certain circles.

Much of which likely contributes to why Trump has aligned himself with the hometown hero in the hopes of prying a victory out of the hands of popular Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who narrowly leads him in most polls ahead of Tuesdays winner-take-all GOP primary.

At a campaign rally in Ohio on Sunday, Trump told attendees:  Charlie Hustle, right? So I watched him and he was a great player. And its so ridiculous. Dont you think hes paid the price? First of all, he didnt bet ... he bet that he would win, not on the other team or anything. Right? But look, hes not supposed to do it, its a terrible thing, all that stuff. How long has he been waiting like 30 years, 35 years? Later, Trump added: We gotta let Pete Rose into the Hall of Fame.

Trump later shared an image of signed baseball sent to him ostensibly by Rose, imploring him to Make America Great Again, in what was widely interpreted as an endorsement:

OHIO: Pete Rose - sends Mr. Trump an autographed baseball: PLEASE #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Y981iAenkb pic.twitter.com/m781srBU9W  Dan Scavino (@DanScavino) March 14, 2016

But later on Monday, a representative for Rose told NBC News in a statement that the ex-athlete has made a point not to endorse any particular presidential candidate. Though he respects everyone who works hard for the country  any outlet that misinterpreted a signed baseball for an endorsement was wrong. Pete did not sent any candidate a signed baseball of a note of endorsement.

The rep went on to say that Rose believes who to vote for is a decision each voter should decide for him or herself.

If Rose did not send the signed baseball in question, its unclear who did. And this is not the first time Trump has purported to have the support of a pro-athlete who later claims no endorsement was made. Last fall Trump claimed to be backed by NFL superstar Tom Brady. And while Brady professed to being friends with Trump and has been spotted with some of his campaign gear, he has said he hasnt endorsed the real estate moguls candidacy either.

Meanwhile, Trump is no Johnny-come-lately when it comes to defending Rose. Its time to let Pete Rose, the all time hits leader, into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Enough already!!!!! he tweeted in 2014. And the year before that, he tweeted: Why has all time hits leader Pete Rose paid a 20 year price whrn [sic] A-Rod gets 200 game penalty. Its time to let Pete into The Hall of Fame!

In December 2015, after MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred denied Roses appeal for reinstatement again, Trump, now a candidate for president, defended him once more, with some people on social media  perhaps sarcastically  suggesting the real estate mogul should pardon the baseball great (should he be elected) or choose the controversial former player as a his running mate.

That month, Aaron Goldstein wrote on The American Spectator blog that the Rose advocacy was good politics on Trumps part.

If its Hillary vs. Trump and it comes down to Ohio, it could be going to bat for Pete Rose is what gets Trump into the White House, he wrote.

With both Trump and Clinton stringing together a series of formidable victories in early primary states, their match-up in the general election is looking increasingly likely. And, as always, Ohio will be a major prize for the eventual winner of the presidency. As for right now, Trump will have to wait until Tuesdays results are in to see if stepping up to plate for Charlie Hustle swings any votes.",[]

msnbc.com,,Texas sued over voter registration policies,[],"Thousands of Texans are being denied the chance to register to vote, violating federal voting laws, a new lawsuit alleges.

Texas voters will continue to be shut out of the democratic process unless and until Defendants reform their registration practices, alleges the complaint, filed Monday in a federal court in San Antonio by the Texas Civil Rights Project.

Plaintiffs in the suit say they tried to update their drivers license and voter registration records through the website of the state Department of Public Safety, and believed they had done so. But when they went to vote, they were found to be unregistered, and forced to cast provisional ballots, which likely wont count.

RELATED: North Carolina braces for strict voter ID law ahead of Tuesday primary

I felt that my voice was taken away from me when my vote wasnt counted, said Totysa Watkins, an African-American woman from Irving, Texas, who works for a health insurer. Voting has always been something I value and is a right I have instilled in my children. Texas should not be able to take that away.

The National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), which aims to make registration as easy as possible, requires that states give people the chance to register to vote when they come in contact with departments of motor vehicles, as well as public assistance agencies. In November, Alabama agreed in a widely praised settlement to comply with the NVRA and make registration easier through its drivers license agency, after the U.S. Justice Department threatened a lawsuit.

The NVRA is very clear: The state must update registration records every time a voter updates his or her drivers license files, stated Peter Kraus, a lawyer helping to bring the suit. We are asking Texas to take simple, commonsense steps to modernize its voter registration procedures and comply with longstanding federal law.

A spokeswoman for Texas Secretary of State Carlos Cascos, who is named as a defendant, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. His office has said in the past that many of the voters who experienced problems have since been registered.

The lawsuit says that, based on public records, Texas received complaints from more than 1,800 people between September 2013 and May 26, 2015. All wrongly believed they were registered after completing an online transaction with DPS. Thats likely just a fraction of the number of Texans who were denied the chance to register, the suit claims, since it includes only those who made formal complaints.

RELATED: Sanders campaign praises Ohio ruling that allows 17-year-olds to vote

Last May, Battleground Texas, a Democratic group working to register Texans to vote, wrote to Cascos charging that the states voter registration failures are widespread and systematically undermining the right to vote in Texas. Mimi Marziani, then Battlegrounds legal director, is now executive director of the Texas Civil Rights Project.

The lawsuit comes as Texas soaring Hispanic population threatens to shift the balance of power in the state. Around 2 million Texas Hispanics are unregistered, and just 39 percent of eligible Hispanics in the state voted in 2012, compared to 61 percent of eligible whites and 63 percent of eligible blacks.

Texas already has the strictest voter registration rules in the country. Since 2011, non-Texans are barred from registering voters; anyone registering voters must undergo training through the county; no one can register voters in counties other than the county where they were appointed; and all voter registration applications must be personally delivered, rather than mailed.

Meanwhile, the states strict voter ID law remains in effect despite adverse rulings from three different federal courts. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals is set to consider a challenge to the law in May. The Supreme Court could have the final say.",[]

The eldest son of the real estate mogul has established a following of his own, thanks to his appearances alongside his father on Celebrity Apprentice. He also has his fair share of detractors  in part due to his proclivity for safari hunting. During this campaign cycle, he has become an increasingly vocal proponent of his fathers controversial positions and, this weekend, he lashed out at protesters at Trump rallies on social media.

Ha 5 students when asked why they were protesting couldnt even answer. The participation medal/micro aggression generation is pretty sad! Trump Jr. tweeted on Friday amid violent clashes between activists and his fathers supporters on the streets of Chicago.

Legend, who is a very public supporter of President Obama and progressive causes, struck back on Twitter. I think they were protesting your racist father, he wrote. This isnt complicated.

This is not controversial. This is not news. The sky is blue. https://t.co/TZCmZEpyyS  John Legend (@johnlegend) March 12, 2016

Trump Jr. tweeted back: Here we go again. That cant be the answer for everything you dont like. Thats why the country is so divided now!

@DonaldJTrumpJr no. Its just the answer when racist racists are saying racist sh-t and are endorsed by the KKK, Legend responded.

RELATED: Supermodel tweets about guns, triggers harsh backlash

The All of Me singer soon found himself fending off shots from Trump supporters. Yes, Trump trolls. Im the real racist, he wrote, with a link to a Daily Beast article that looks at the 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit against the real estate mogul for deliberately discriminating against African-Americans seeking housing in one of his buildings. When Trump backers tried to label Legend as uneducated  which was just a small sample of the racially tinged invective directed at him  he pointed out that he graduated from the same Ivy League school, the University of Pennsylvania, as Trump and his son:

.@DanielT03571138 @DonaldJTrumpJr the Donalds and I graduated from the same University, funny enough.  John Legend (@johnlegend) March 12, 2016

This is not the first time a member of the Legend family has tussled with the Trumps. Legends wife, supermodel Chrissy Teigen, took shots at Trump late last fall when the candidate promoted an upcoming meeting with black evangelical clergymen on social media by insisting its not a press event.

@realDonaldTrump so dont tweet about it you tt, Teigen wrote on Twitter.

Trump took the bait, retweeting a supporter of his who wrote: Wow! Trashy gutter mouth woman. You cant hold a candle 2 Melania Trump when it comes to beauty and eloquence.

Teigen retorted: Ok trumpers lets get one thing straight, we both married well and pose half naked, Im not alone in this. The candidates wife is a former model who did once pose nude for British GQ. Lol poor melania doesnt need to be dragged into this. She goes through enough already, she added. The whole exchange happened to take place on Teigens 30th birthday, and the model called the backlash from Trump the perfect gift.

The planned meeting with black pastors, which Trump boasted would result in 100 endorsements, was canceled after it became apparent that he would not be getting their support. I think what happened ... probably some of the Black Lives Matter folks called them up and said, Oh, you shouldnt be meeting with Trump because he believes that all lives matter, Trump said on MSNBCs Morning Joe afterwards. I believe black lives do matter, but I believe all lives matter  very strongly.

This weekend, Tiegen stood by her husband after his Trump Jr. feud with the simple tweet: Got em.

Meanwhile, Trump Jr. appears to be following his fathers lead when it comes to antagonizing his political opponents. According to Gawker, he briefly retweeted (and then deleted) allegations that a 63-year-old woman photographed outside the Trump rally in Chicago doing the Nazi salute was actually a plant from the Bernie Sanders campaign, misidentifying her as Portia Boulger, who runs a Women for Sanders Twitter account.

The New York Times interviewed the woman, identified as Birgitt Peterson, and confirmed that she is a Trump supporter and that she made the gesture as a counter-protest to make the point that they are demonstrating something they had no knowledge about. Peterson, who was born in West Berlin, was offended by comparisons between Adolf Hitler and the GOP front-runner.

msnbc.com,,Cruz stands by pledge unless Trump shoots someone,['Vaughn Hillyard'],"GLEN ELLYN, Illinois  Ted Cruz suggested on Monday that it would take Donald Trump shooting somebody in New York City to not support the current front-runner in the general election if he becomes the Republican Party presidential nominee.

Well I can give you one example where I would no longer support Donald Trump, Cruz told reporters in Rockford, Illinois. If, for example, he were to go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, I would not be willing to support Donald Trump.

Reporters pressed Cruz on Monday why he would continue to back Trump despite suggesting over the weekend that Trump encourages violence and disrespects voters.

RELATED: No one knows how bad the Trump situation is going to get

Since the first GOP debate, Cruz has maintained his commitment to supporting the eventual Republican nominee next November. He continued to hold the line on Monday, telling reporters, When I tell you Im going to do something, Im going to do it.

Cruz continued: At the outset of this campaign, I committed to support the Republican nominee, and I honor my word. And honoring your word means actually honoring your word. You do what you said you would do.

The Texas senator also said over the weekend that Hillary Clinton would do even more damage to the country and be the lesser of two evils.

His comments Monday referenced a statement Trump made earlier this year, saying his supporters were so strongly behind him that I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldnt lose voters.

Marco Rubio and John Kasich cast doubt this weekend over their own pledges to back Trump after the candidate welcomed violence at his campaign rallies.

Rubio told reporters earlier on Saturday that it was getting harder every day to see him putting his backing behind Trump. And Kasich condemned the toxic environment harvested by Trump, adding Trumps recent actions are making it very extremely difficult to support him.

Cruz also continued his push on Monday for Rubio and Kasich to leave the race and narrow the field into a head-to-head matchup with Trump - a duel Cruzs campaign believes would allow the Texas senator to still win the GOP nomination outright before this summers convention.

As part of that call, Cruz told reporters he is open to the pair joining a potential Cruz administration.

You know, going forward, look, of course, I could absolutely see a place for Marco Rubio and john Kasich in an administration, Cruz said.

Cruz is making a five-stop swing through Illinois before the states primary on Tuesday.

msnbc.com,,"Cuban, Venezuelan immigrants wrestle with Bernie Sanders' brand of socialism",[],"ORLANDO, Fla.  Alejandra Chacons family had heard promises of a political revolution before, but they werent willing to stick around long enough to see how it played out.

They bolted from Venezuela when Alejandra was a young girl. And like many other Venezuelans who relocated to Florida, along with their Cuban-American neighbors, hearing a U.S. presidential candidate press for revolutionary change conjures uncomfortable memories of the conditions they once fled.

If under any other circumstance Chacons family would be drawn to Bernie Sanders message, for now, theyre taking a pause.

Its hard for us. Were coming from a country where people are running away from socialism, and then for it to be here? Chacon, 22, said.

Over dinner, in coffee shops and around the community, Chacon says the topic of Sanders political leanings comes up frequently with her family and others members of the growing Venezuelan community in central Florida. If this presidential election cycle has taught them anything, its the difficulty of overcoming a deeply personal association with a message of revolution coming from a self-described Democratic socialist.

I understand that its a different kind of politics, Chacon said. I dont think Bernie would actually change the entire country to socialism. But we talk about it a lot.

For decades Florida has been a haven for exiles who fled the communist regime led by the Castro brothers in Cuba. In recent years a steady population of Venezuelans has resettled here too, escaping the fallout from the late socialist President Hugo Chavez, who came into power in 1999.

Their past experiences, coupled with an unfamiliarity with Sanders candidacy, poses obstacles in the Vermont senators ability to engage a crucial swing states burgeoning Hispanic population. Hillary Clinton is building on a well-known and well-received brand. In many ways, Sanders is starting at zero.

The question of his brand of socialism, and the underlying question of his electability, has been raised repeatedly over the last several months. Confronted with making the distinction during a town hall hosted by MSNBC in Nevada, Sanders was readily game to describe why Hispanic families should not be fearful of his policies.

When I talk about Democratic socialist, Im not looking at Venezuela. Im not looking at Cuba. Im looking at countries like Denmark and Sweden, Sanders said. And you know what goes on in those countries? All of the kids who have the ability and desire go to college. And you know how much it costs? It is free.

He was pressed anew last week during a debate hosted by Univision, where moderators unearthed a 30-year-old clip showing Sanders praising Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. Standing before a heavily Hispanic crowd in Miami, a stronghold of Cuban-Americans, Sanders had to walk a fine line  standing by his previous comments while explaining how he had applauded Cubas universal health care and educational systems.

The current Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro entered the fray this week, praising Sanders at an event in the Venezuelan capital, Caracas, that commemorated Anti-Imperialism Day.

Sanders is an emerging candidate with a renovating and revolutionary message, Maduro said on Wednesday. He is the son of Jew immigrants from New York and was raised in Brooklyn.

Much of the response to Sanders candidacy has broken down along generational lines, not unlike the response to the normalization of relations between the U.S. and Cuba. The association is especially difficult for older generations who either lived through dictatorial regimes or have grown fearful of what theyve seen in their home countries from afar.

I came here 26 years ago, because at that time it was the first sense that something is going to be bad, said Naloy Zapata, 62, who now lives in Orlando. So I got out right away.

Adding to the unease is the fact that Floridians are still getting to know Sanders. This week he visited Florida for this first time in his presidential campaign. His rally in Miami marked 10 months into his White House bid and only one week ahead of the states primary.

According to the latest NBC News/Marist/WSJ poll out on Sunday, Sanders is trailing Clinton by 27 points in Florida, 61 percent to 34 percent. For Sanders supporters, the issue boils down to time  they need more of it to correct wrong assumptions and teach people about their candidate.

People tend to think of the negative examples with socialism, said Anna Garcia, 29, a Sanders supporter. I think we have to just teach people the positive.",[]

A scary time in American politics

We love American politics because of its excitement, its unpredictability, and its clash of ideas and policies. But weve never seen this in our lifetimes until now  when politics becomes scary. And that has been the overarching political story over the past 96 hours, as Donald Trump rallies have featured sucker punches, scuffles, unrest, and even a protester trying to jump on the stage. Were all on edge that something even scarier might happen, which is something Trump supporter Ben Carson suggested on Today this morning. I think certainly if the protesters continue with their Alinksy-ite tactics, there is a real possibility of escalation because those who are the victims of them have two choices: They can submit to them and meekly just do whatever those protesters want them to do, or they can fight back. And if they decide to fight back there could be an escalation. And as we said on Friday, its on the candidate for setting the tone at his/her rallies. But on Meet the Press yesterday, Trump said he wasnt responsible for the unrest. I dont accept responsibility; I do not condone violence in any shape. And he mentioned that hes instructed his people to look into covering the legal fees for the man who sucker punched the protester.

Where is the rest of the GOP establishment?

Yesterday, NBCs Hallie Jackson reported that Mitt Romney will campaign today for John Kasich during two stops in Ohio  all in an effort to stop Trump. (Jackson reports that the campaigning isnt an endorsement.) But we have to ask: Where is the rest of the Republican Party? The Bushes? The Cheneys? Paul Ryan? Condi Rice? After the last 96 hours in politics, their silence is pretty stunning.

NBC/WSJ/Marist polls: Trump ahead in Florida, Illinois; Kasich leads in Ohio

Tuesday brings us GOP and Democratic primaries in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ohio  with Florida and Ohio being winner-take-all states on the Republican side. And were dubbing tomorrow Separation Tuesday, because were either going to see Trump and Clinton further separate themselves from their competition, or we wont. On Sunday, we released three new NBC/WSJ/Marist polls:

In Florida, Trump holds a 2-to-1 advantage among likely GOP voters over Marco Rubio, the states U.S. senator, 43%-22%. Theyre followed by Ted Cruz at 21% and John Kasich at 9%.

In Illinois, Trump gets the support of 34% of likely GOP primary voters, Cruz gets 25%, Kasich gets 21% and Rubio gets 16%.

But in Ohio, Kasich, the states incumbent governor, holds a six-point lead over Trump, 39% to 33% - followed by Cruz at 19% and Rubio at 6%.

And this morning, Quinnipiac has new Republican numbers for Florida (Trump 46%, Rubio 22%, Cruz 14%, Kasich 10%) and Ohio (Trump 38%, Kasich 38%, Cruz 16%, Rubio 3%).

Why Clinton winning three of five Separation Tuesday states would be a good night for her  and why losing three would be another rough night

Meanwhile, our NBC/WSJ/Marist polls show Hillary Clinton leading all three states:

In Florida, Clinton is ahead of Sanders among likely primary voters by 27 points in Florida, 61 percent to 34 percent;

In Ohio, shes up by 20 points, 58 percent to 38 percent;

But in Illinois, her lead is just six points, 51 percent to 45 percent.

The Clinton camp insists that the polling in Ohio is closer, and Quinnipiac finds her up by five points in the Buckeye State, 51%-46%, while it has her leading Sanders 60%-34% in Florida. And the Clinton campaign is insisting that it will still best Sanders in delegates  no matter what happens in Ohio, Illinois, or Missouri. Even if he won in Ohio [and] Illinois, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told the New York Times, we would still have more delegates on the 15th because of their performance in delegate-rich Florida and North Carolina. Thats true. But Clinton winning three out of the five states on Tuesday  say Florida, North Carolina, and Ohio  would be a good night for the campaign. But losing three out of five  with the polling lead in Ohio  would produce another round of negative news cycles like we saw after Michigan. Starting at 6:00 pm ET, MSNBC features back-to-back Sanders/Clinton town halls.

Doing the delegate math: Why Florida and Ohio are so important for Trump

Below is our latest math after GOP delegates were awarded from DC and Wyoming over the weekend, and here is the stark reality: Trump really needs to win both Florida and Ohio to be on a path to winning 1,237 delegates. And after the past weekend, you could argue that he has no margin for error  if hes short, you could see a real effort to deny him the nomination in Cleveland.

Trump currently holds an 84-delegate lead over Ted Cruz

msnbc.com,,Vladimir Putin orders Russian military pullout from Syria,"['Alexy Eremenko', 'Corky Siemaszko']","Russian strongman Vladimir Putin declared mission accomplished Monday and said he is withdrawing his troops from war-torn Syria now that peace talks are underway.

I believe that the goal set out to the ministry of defense and the armed forces has, in large part, been fulfilled and thats why I order the minister of defense as of tomorrow to start the pullout of the main part of our military grouping from the Syrian Arab Republic, Putin said.

Putins declaration came as United Nations-led negotiations got underway in Geneva, Switzerland to end the brutal and bloody civil war that has left thousands dead and sent millions more into exile.

With Russian help, Putin insisted, the Syrian armed forces and patriotic Syrian forces have been able to achieve a fundamental turnaround in the fight against international terrorism and have taken the initiative in almost all respects.

While the Russian troops will start leaving Tuesday, Putin said that Moscows airbase in Syrias coastal province of Latakia, and a naval facility in the Syrian port of Tartus, will continue to operate.

Putin sent in Russian forces into Syria in October to prop-up tottering dictator Bashar Assad, who was being attacked from one side by Islamic State militants and from the other by U.S.-backed Syrian rebels seeking regime change.

In the months that followed, the anti-Assad forces accused the Russians of taking the fight to them to protect Assad rather than going after ISIS.

Putin denied the charge. What we are trying to achieve is to contribute to the fight against terrorism, which is a threat to both the United States to Russia to European countries and the whole world, he said.

Syrias state news agency meanwhile quoted President Assad on Monday as saying that the Russian military wont leave the country altogether.

Assad said Russia will decrease its presence to levels in line with the situation on the ground and the continuation of the cessation of hostilities, state TV quoted him as saying.

Assad said the collaboration between Russian and Syrian forces has secured victories against terrorism and returned security to the country.

Arizona Sen. John McCain, the Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a harsh critic of President Obamas Syrian strategy to oust Assad and battle ISIS, said Putin has saved the Syrian despots hide.

The announcement that Russia will begin withdrawing some military forces from Syria signals Vladimir Putins belief that he has bombed and killed enough of the opponents of the murderous Assad regime to ensure its survival, he said in a statement.

msnbc.com,,Humans of New York creator to Trump: 'The hateful one is you',[],"The creator of the popular photo blog Humans of New York is condemning Republican front-runner Donald Trump for his controversial, racially charged campaign rhetoric.

In an open letter to the real estate mogul posted on his Facebook page, photojournalist Brandon Stanton writes that while he takes great pains to be nonpartisan, he now believes that opposing Trump is no longer a political decision. It is a moral one.

Ive watched you retweet racist images. Ive watched you retweet racist lies. Ive watched you take 48 hours to disavow white supremacy. Ive watched you joyfully encourage violence, and promise to pay the legal fees of those who commit violence on your behalf. Ive watched you advocate the use of torture and the murder of terrorists families. Ive watched you gleefully tell stories of executing Muslims with bullets dipped in pig blood. Ive watched you compare refugees to snakes, and claim that Islam hates us, he wrote.

RELATED: GOP cares a lot less about immigration than Donald Trump wants you to think

Stanton, who has profiled hundreds of Muslims around the globe, most recently refugees from Syria and Iraq, tells Trump he has reached the conclusion that the hateful one is you. MSNBC reached out to the Trump campaign for comment on Stantons letter, but has not heard back at this time.

The Humans of New York Facebook page has more than 17 million followers and almost 5 million followers on Instagram. Prior to the blogs social media success, it was a best-selling book, featuring Stantons profiles of residents of the Big Apple.

In recent years, Stantons focus has shifted to the plight of refugees. His recent profile of a Syrian refugee named The Scientist, who lost his wife and daughter in a bombing and is fighting stomach cancer, inspired a massive fundraising campaign led by actor Edward Norton last December. It raised nearly half a million dollars for the man and his surviving family members.

Its wonderful to see people acting out of their sense of empathy and shared humanity and making that small gesture towards someone they dont even know  its very powerful, Norton told MSNBC at the time. It gives you a good feeling about people.

Trump has infamously been inconsistent on the issue of Syrian refugees. After saying the U.S. should accept more Syrians last September, he has since told his supporters that they should be on notice because if he is elected president theyre going back! The GOP front-runner has gone on to suggest that refugees could be a Trojan Horse for terrorist activity in the U.S. and more recently that they could be ISIS ... and by the way, it is turning out that they probably are ISIS.

RELATED: John Legend to Donald Trump Jr.: Your dad is racist

Last month, according to The Hill, Trump told a supporter he would have no problem looking the child of a refugee in the face and saying: You cant come here.

Stantons letter arrives amid a span of several days where Trumps rhetoric regarding Muslims has grown even more polarizing. He has declared that Islam hates us and that 27 percent are really very militant about going after things. These positions, in addition to advocating for a temporary ban on all emigration to the United States by people who practice the Muslim faith, have been widely criticized by Trumps opponents on the left and some of his fellow Republicans.

As violence has erupted at some of his recent political rallies, the real estate mogul has refused to take responsibility, placing the blame instead on what hes called disruptors at his events. In his open letter, Stanton directly challenges Trumps claims that he is not the aggressor in clashes with protesters.

You are not a unifier. You are not presidential. You are not a victim of the very anger that youve joyfully enflamed for months, wrote Stanton. You are a man who has encouraged prejudice and violence in the pursuit of personal power. And though your words will no doubt change over the next few months, you will always remain who you are.",[]

msnbc.com,,North Carolina braces for strict voter ID law ahead of Tuesday primary,[],"A strict voter ID law will be in effect for the first time in Tuesdays primary in North Carolina, where an estimated 218,000 registered voters dont have the identification theyll need to vote. Two other presidential battleground states, Florida and Ohio, also vote Tuesday and have restrictions in place.

There have already been voting problems in North Carolina, especially in student-heavy areas, according to reports. Student IDs arent accepted under the law, and neither are out-of-state drivers licenses. One senior at UNC Chapel-Hill who voted in the 2012 presidential election said he showed his Pennsylvania license and was forced to cast a provisional ballot, which may not be counted. His was one of numerous anecdotes to emerge in recent days of North Carolinians prevented from voting.

Desmond Meade of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition and Ahmad Abuznaid of Dream Defenders join to discus embed like save share group

In the states early voting period, 2,567 people have had to cast provisional ballots865 because they didnt bring one of the types of ID allowed under the law, according to a report by The Nation. Theyll need to return in the next week to make their vote count. A group of 391 people said they had a reasonable impediment that prevented them from getting an ID. (Of course, these figures dont include the unknown number of voters who were deterred even from showing up thanks to the ID requirement.)

The reasonable impediment provision was added by Republicans looking to ensure that courts dont strike down the law, but it appears to be poorly understood. Sen. Richard Burr, a Republican, was one of those who used the provision at a polling place after forgetting his ID.

RELATED: Sanders campaign praises Ohio ruling that allows 17-year-olds to vote

North Carolinas restrictive voting law was passed in 2013 after the Supreme Court weakened the Voting Rights Act. In addition to the ID provision, which was delayed until this year, it also shortened early voting, scrapped same-day registration, banned out-of-precinct voting and in several other ways made it harder to cast a ballot. In 2014, the law disenfranchised an estimated 30,000 people, even without the ID provision.

Meanwhile in Florida, more than 1.5 million people and more than one in five black people will be barred from voting Tuesday by the states longstanding felon disenfranchisement law, the strictest in the country.

In 2007, then-Florida Gov. Charlie Crist issued an order to automatically restore the rights of felons who had completed their sentences. But it was reversed in 2011 by Gov. Rick Scott, meaning ex-felons looking to vote must have their applications personally approved by the governor.

And in Ohio, Republican cuts to early voting have reduced the number of hours during which voters can go to the polls. But in a win for voting, a judge rejected an effort by Secretary of State Jon Husted to stop 17-year-olds who will be 18 by the November general election from voting in the primary. Husteds move was challenged by the Bernie Sanders campaign, which is popular with young voters.",[]

msnbc.com,,How bad will confirmation process get? Ask these would-be judges,['Nbc News'],"Anyone hoping for clues as to what a US Supreme Court nominee anticipating a tough confirmation battle might face should look to the nations circuit courts of appeals and the people who almost served as judges.

Supreme Court nominations have historically been rife with partisanship  in a much more public way than have lower appellate, and especially district court, nominees, judicial experts say.

But while the selection and confirmation process for Supreme Court justices is much different from that of appellate court judges, lower confirmation rates are one way in which their collective experiences may very well intersect this time around.

RELATED: RNC launches campaign to oppose Obamas Supreme Court pick

President Obamas Supreme Court nominee will likely be an appeals court judge who was overwhelmingly confirmed to his or her current seat, based on the names most often mentioned as being on the shortlist. Republican leaders in the Senate, however, have insisted that they will not even grant the presidents appointee a private meeting, much less a hearing and subsequent vote.

The stakes are high, and the process affects the nominees in a profound and emotional way, former unsuccessful nominees to the appellate courts say.

That person will be pilloried, maligned, slandered and libeled, said Bonnie Campbell, a former Iowa attorney general who was nominated in 2000 by former President Clinton to the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals. Her own nomination was mired in a political fight as Republicans objected to the former gubernatorial candidates views on some conservative Christians as the radical right.

The American people know that it is not about you. It is not personal. You have been put in the partisan cross-hairs, and anything might be said about you ... and most of what is said wont be true, Campbell said. There is a higher calling than the process you have to endure. The strength and style with which you handle this challenge will not go unnoticed by the next president.

Noticed, perhaps, but that doesnt mean a confirmation is in a nominees future.

I think you just have to figure out how to retain your sanity and realize that this process is largely not about you, said J. Rich Leonard, the dean of Campbell Universitys Norman Adrian Wiggins School of Law, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton to the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. Once you get over a threshold of accomplishment and ability that unequivocally demonstrates that you are suited for the appointment, then you are just caught in a political whirlwind that you have very little ability to influence.

Leonard was a US bankruptcy judge in North Carolina at the time of his appointment, received a well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association and the support of his Democratic senator, John Edwards.

However, Leonard was blocked by his other home state senator, Jesse Helms, a Republican.

RELATED: Elizabeth Warren challenges Republicans to do their jobs

Leonard was then nominated to a seat on the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, only to have his nomination to the lower-profile court blocked again by Helms. Leonard didnt receive a hearing for either nomination.

Since 1946, about 77 percent of appeals court nominees have been confirmed compared to around 88 percent for Supreme Court nominees, said Sarah Binder, a professor at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who co-authored a 2009 book on the judicial selection process.

The most important difference to highlight is the sheer public salience and intensity of media coverage that Supreme Court nominees face compared to lower court candidates, Binder said.

Stuart Summit, a New York attorney who in 1987 was nominated by President Ronald Reagan to the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals, said that he focused heavily on his year-long vetting process and didnt remain as active in his law firm as he would have preferred. And though for Summit people took for granted that there was going to be a confirmation, ultimately that just didnt happen.

Summit said the nominee should proceed in a way that does the least damage to him or her professionally, especially since the odds of anyone being confirmed would be very low.

The process is much, much worse since the time I went through it, as bad as, or difficult as it was, said Summit, a partner in the litigation department of Phillips Nizer LLP.

Summits home state senator, Republican Alphonse DAmato, placed a hold on the nomination  a move that surprised the former New York City official.

RELATED: Senate Republicans debunk their own Supreme Court talking points

That a single senator, never mind one who introduced me to the committee, could simply stop the entire process only a few days before my confirmation without having to explain himself to anyone and without the courtesy of explaining himself to me, is simply beyond my understanding, Summit told theNew York Times in 1988. Its not in my makeup to be bitter. But no matter how exciting or thrilling my life now is, I will carry a sense of sadness with me. I had visualized myself dying in that job. Ill be grieving, probably all of my life.

The risk might not be worth the reward, said William Myers, who was nominated in 2003 by former President George W. Bush to serve of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Democrats filibustered his nomination and he ultimately withdrew his name from consideration.

If the nominee is rejected by the Senate, he or she would have no hope of resurrecting the nomination under a new President, Myers said. My advice would be to agree to be nominated and then hope the nomination doesnt come up for a vote this Congress.

Voters in Ohio, Florida, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri head to the polls where front-runners Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are hoping to separate from the rest of the pack for good.

The winner-take-all states of Ohio and Florida top the GOP contests, where a total of 376 delegates are at stake (including a handful from the Northern Mariana Islands). Donald Trump's drive to the nomination would be very difficult to halt if he were to sweep Tuesday's contests. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio faces a must-win in his home state of Florida, but trails in the latest polls. Meanwhile, Ohio Gov. John Kasich also must win his home state -- where polls show him running virtually tied with Donald Trump -- to continue his campaign forward. And Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is looking to make inroads in Illinois and Missouri.

On the Democratic side, there are a total of 793 delegates up for grabs and Hillary Clinton will look to extend her lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Clinton is expected to do well in Florida, but Sanders will try to replicate his surprise victory in Michigan in neighboring Ohio and Illinois.

msnbc.com,,Breitbart's Michelle Fields and three others resign over Trump incident,['Cassandra Vinograd'],"Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields has resigned from the conservative news site over its response to her alleged assault by Donald Trumps campaign manager.

Three of her colleagues also resigned from Breitbart: editor-at-large Ben Shapiro, national security reporter Jordan Schachtel and Jarrett Stepman, an editor.

In his departing statement on Sunday, Shapiro said the site should be ashamed of their treatment of Fields, whose allegations of assault came amid escalating violence in and around Trump campaign events.

Schachtel and Stepman followed Monday.

Breitbart News is no longer a journalistic enterprise, but instead, in my opinion, something resembling an unaffiliated media Super PAC for the Trump campaign, Schachtel said in a statement first reported by Politico. I signed my contract to work as a journalist, not as a member of the Donald J. Trump for President media network.

I resigned from Breitbart. Was a great run & I wish I couldve prevented what its become. Still many grt ppl there. Sorry to let u all down  Jordan Schachtel (@JordanSchachtel) March 14, 2016

Stepman said in his own statement that Breitbart was becoming less of a news site and more of a propaganda organization dedicated to the Trump campaign.

JUST IN - Jordan Schachtel and Jarrett Stepman have also resigned from Breitbart pic.twitter.com/ViA1PFuDJr  Hadas Gold (@Hadas_Gold) March 14, 2016

Fields accused Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski of grabbing her arm so hard she bruised as she attempted to question the candidate at an event. She wrote an account of the incident, as did a Washington Post reporter who said he witnessed it. Politico also published an audio transcript that purportedly captures the interaction and moments immediately afterward.

Related: Heres What Trump Supporters Think of Rally Violence

The Trump campaign fought back hard against the allegations. Lewandowski called Fields delusional and an attention seeker, while Trump accused the reporter of having made up the incident. Fields, meanwhile, filed a police report.

I cant stand with an organization that wont stand by me: https://t.co/pohxCKScpf  Michelle Fields (@MichelleFields) March 14, 2016

In the immediate aftermath, another Breitbart reporter appeared to question Fields allegations on Twitter. That reporter was suspended  and the news sites chief executive issued a statement backing Fields and calling on Lewandowski to apologize.

However, the site then published images questioning whether the Washington Posts Ben Terris misidentified Lewandowski as the person who may have physically assaulted Fields. Breitbart later published a piece purporting to show text messages from Lewandowski which it said prove he didnt assault Fields.

I guess these just magically appeared on me @CLewandowski_ @realDonaldTrump. So weird. pic.twitter.com/oD8c4D7tw3  Michelle Fields (@MichelleFields) March 10, 2016

That appeared to be the final straw for Fields, who informed management of her resignation on Sunday night.

I do not believe Breitbart News has adequately stood by me during the events of the past week and because of that I believe it is now best for us to part ways,she said in a statement issued to Buzzfeed.

Her colleague Shapiro went further, accusing Breitbart of abandoning and undercutting Fields in order to protect a bully  Trump  and his bully campaign manager.

Both Lewandowski and Trump maligned Michelle in the most repulsive fashion. Meanwhile, Breitbart News not only stood by and did nothing outside of tepidly asking for an apology, they then attempted to abandon Michelle by silencing staff from tweeting or talking about the issue, Shapiro said in a statement issued to Buzzfeed.

He said the story suggesting Fields and Terris had misidentified Lewandowski  a poorly-evidenced conspiracy theory  was the ultimate indignity.

This is disgusting, Shapiro said. No news outlet would stand for it.

Breitbart News has not formally commented on the resignations.

However, the site ran a piece on its homepage Monday with the headline Ben Shapiro betrays loyal Breitbart readers in pursuit of Fox News contributorship. The piece was later removed but can still be found online .

Breitbart later posted a statement in its place from editor-at-large and in-house counsel Joel Pollak who apologized to Fields and Shapiro for the piece.

The article was written by me as part of an effort to make light of a significant company event, and was published as a result of a misunderstanding without going through the normal editorial channels, the statement said.

The Fields incident came a week after a Time magazine photographer was thrown to the floor by a Secret Service agent at another Trump rally and amid escalating concerns over the rhetoric used by the Republican frontrunner.

Trump has come under mounting criticism  from Democrats and from Republican rivals  for failing to fully denounce violent incidents at his eventsand for creating a climate where such incidents can persist.

Those issues were amplified in recent days after video emerged of a man at a Trump rally sucker-punching a protester leaving an event in North Carolina and fights broke out at a cancelled event in Chicago.

Trump himself has said he would like to punch a protester in the face and see another taken out on a stretcher.

msnbc.com,,Hillary Clinton: Trump harkens back to lynchmobs,[],"Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump is inciting mob violence that recalls lynch mobs Monday evening at an MSNBC townhall, where she also took tough questions on foreign policy and trade.

Clinton told MSNBCs Chris Matthews, who moderated the event in Springfield, Illinois, that she holds Trump responsible for the violence seen in recent days at his rallies, and believes his rhetoric is not only wrong and offensive, but also dangerous. Hes been building this incitement, she said.

RELATED: Sanders: Trump enticing his supporters to be violent

When you are inciting mob violence, which is what Trump is doing, Clinton said, theres a lot of memories that people have. Theyre in the DNA. People remember mob violence that lead to lynching, people remember mob violence that lead to people being shot, being grabbed, being mistreated. And its something that has a deep, almost psychological resonance to people who have ever been in any position of feeling somewhat fearful, somewhat worried.

Clinton also took tough questions from Matthews on her history of supporting military intervention abroad, including the Iraq War.

The former senator and secretary of state said she believed Iraq had nuclear weapons in the lead up to the war, noting that the Clinton administration believed that Iraq obfuscated its plans from international weapons inspectors during her husbands final years in office.

But Clinton said Bush misled the Congress in saying the vote for military authorization in Iraq would not be used to actually go to war. I believed George W. Bush when he said were going to let the inspectors finish the job. This vote will give me the leverage, he claimed, to make sure that happens,  she said.

On regime change in general, Clinton insisted she is not a hawk. No, Im a smart power advocate, she said. And while she agreed that toppling dictators or foreign government is not advisable in the vast majority of cases, there are exceptions, like in Rwanda and the hypothetical of assassinating Hitler before he took power in Germany. You cannot paint with a broad brush, she said.

Matthews also pressed her on why she changed her position on the Trans Pacific Partnership, the massive trade deal with a dozen Asian countries she came out against last year. Sanders had opposed it from the beginning. MSNBC conducted a separate town hall with Sanders, moderated by Chuck Todd, which aired immediately before Clintons. RELATED: Hillary Clinton sounds off on trade, the economy Free trade is an emotional issue in states that have lost manufacturing jobs like Ohio and Illinois, both of which hold primaries Tuesday, but Clinton said that while she and Sanders agree on TPP specifically, they have different views on trade in general.

Bush when he said were going to let the inspectors finish the job. This vote will give me the leverage, he claimed, to make sure that happens,  she said.

On regime change in general, Clinton insisted she is not a hawk. No, Im a smart power advocate, she said. And while she agreed that toppling dictators or foreign government is not advisable in the vast majority of cases, there are exceptions, like in Rwanda and the hypothetical of assassinating Hitler before he took power in Germany. You cannot paint with a broad brush, she said.

Matthews also pressed her on why she changed her position on the Trans Pacific Partnership, the massive trade deal with a dozen Asian countries she came out against last year. Sanders had opposed it from the beginning. MSNBC conducted a separate town hall with Sanders, moderated by Chuck Todd, which aired immediately before Clintons. RELATED: Hillary Clinton sounds off on trade, the economy Free trade is an emotional issue in states that have lost manufacturing jobs like Ohio and Illinois, both of which hold primaries Tuesday, but Clinton said that while she and Sanders agree on TPP specifically, they have different views on trade in general.

I know you have to trade with the rest of the world, she said. He just is reflexively against anything that has any international implications.

She spoke again about her limitations as a politician, acknowledging she is not as natural an orator as her husband or President Obama. Im not bringing people to fever pitches of incredible admiration, she said. But whenever I have a job, I do it well.",[]
