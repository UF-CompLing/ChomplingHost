msnbc.com,,AG Loretta Lynch asks 'not to be considered' for Supreme Court,['Pete Williams'],"U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch has asked not to be considered for nomination to the Supreme Court to take the spot formerly occupied by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, the Justice Department said Tuesday.

Administration insiders had concluded more than a week ago that Lynchs nomination would create an opening for Senate Republicans to demand Justice Department documents on pending investigations, and it was therefore considered a non-starter.

Lynch had been among the names floated by observers as potential nominees. Scalia, the influential conservative, died in Texas on Feb. 13.

Senate Republicans have vowed to block anyone President Obama chooses, saying the next president should choose the next Supreme Court justice.

As the conversation around the Supreme Court vacancy progressed, the Attorney General determined that the limitations inherent in the nomination process would curtail her effectiveness in her current role, the Justice Department said in a statement.

Given the urgent issues before the Department of Justice, she asked not to be considered for the position. While she is deeply grateful for the support and good wishes of all those who suggested her as a potential nominee, she is honored to serve as Attorney General, and she is fully committed to carrying out the work of the Department of Justice for the remainder of her term.

msnbc.com,,The missing details from Bernie Sanders' general-election pitch,[],"In Sunday nights debate, Anderson Cooper asked Bernie Sanders about how hed approach a general-election match-up against Donald Trump. The Vermont senator didnt have to think much about the answer

I would love to run against Donald Trump, and Ill tell you why. For a start, almost, not all, but almost every poll has shown that Sanders vs. Trump does a lot better than Clinton vs. Trump. Right here in Michigan there was a poll done, I think yesterday, or today, had me beating Trump in Michigan by 22 points. Secretary Clinton beat him as well, but not by so much. And, thats true nationally, and in many other states.

Theres simply no denying the accuracy of Sanders boast. The polling data is publicly available, and most of it looks exactly the way the senator described it: both of the Democratic candidates lead Trump in a hypothetical general election, but Sanders advantage is larger.

Just yesterday, the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll reinforced the thesis with national results that showed Clinton leading Trump by 13 points, but Sanders ahead by 18 points. The latest Washington Post/ABC News poll showed similar results. So did the most recent national USA Today/Suffolk poll . So did the most recent national Quinnipiac poll

If one or two of these showed outlier results, itd be easier to question the reliability of the numbers, but when theres polling unanimity, the observation is much tougher to question.

And so, Sanders and his supporters point to these polls, loudly and repeatedly, as a way of deflecting questions about the Independent senators electability. And really, who can blame them? Most voters are reluctant to throw away a vote on a candidate whos bound to lose, and the Vermonter and his campaign allies appear to have quantifiable proof that hes a safe choice perhaps even the safer choice.

But some caveats are in order. The problem isnt that Sanders argument is wrong  the data clearly backs him up  but rather, that the argument is incomplete in a broader context.

For example, while general-election polling at this stage is interesting for establishing baselines, its also unreliable. Vox published a piece last week pointing to the available political-science research.

In an interview, [Robert S. Erikson] told me that general election polling from this time of year is pretty meaningless, and said he was surprised his work had been cited to argue for Sanderss general election chances. Bernie can look good in some polls, but I dont think anyone who follows politics thinks those would hold in November, Erikson said. It is for this reason that some, like Seth McKee, a political science professor at Texas Tech University, regard such early polls as absolutely worthless. Relatively few voters have made up their minds this long before the election, McKee says.

Even if you put this aside and take the early polling very seriously, there are other areas of concern. Revisiting our discussion from a couple of months ago, Hillary Clinton has been a high-profile national figure for many years, and her public reputation has been shaped in part by attacks from Republicans whove hated her, on a professional level, for the better part of a quarter-century.

Sanders, in contrast, has never sought national office and has never been subjected to the full weight of the GOP Attack Machine, in part because his re-election bids in Vermont have been so easy. Indeed, much of the public, which is not yet engaged in the presidential campaign, probably has very little idea about who the senator is and what he believes.

And so the question for Democrats is not just which candidate has a poll advantage now, but also which candidate seems likely to withstand the onslaught of attacks that would inevitably come in the fall.

Sanders obviously wants voters to believe hes that candidate. It is, however, a speculative question  no one can say with certainty whether or not hes correct. That said, e xperts can make educated projections. GW political scientist John Sides noted last month that Sanders views and ideology creates the risk of a penalty at the ballot box.

He highlighted a Gallup report published last summer that asked Americans, without mentioning any candidates names, whether voters would be comfortable with different kinds of presidential candidates. For example, 93% of Americans said theyre fine with voting for a Roman Catholic, and 92% of voters are on board with supporting a woman.

Further down the list, just 60% said they could vote for a Muslim, and atheists did a little worse, at 58%.

Socialists, however, finished dead last at 47%  the only group that finished below 50%.",[]

Why did you get involved in student government?

I got involved in student government in college because I wanted the opportunity to hit the ground running and understand more about my campus. I have always been a natural problem solver and the Student Assembly gave me the opportunity assist my peers grappling with campus issues. It really has evolved into a platform to voice student concerns and shape the future direction of Cornell.

Do you plan to vote in the primary and/or November presidential elections this year?

Yes! Voting is vital to the American democratic process. I dont vote unless I am informed: so I stay abreast of news outlets and try to develop my own opinion.

Have you ever been in a protest? If so, how was it and how has it affected your leadership work?

I have been involved in a protest at Cornell around the student health fee and the viability of shared governance. It opened my eyes to the importance of smart activism, where protesters use existing structure in a respectful way to intelligently get their point across. Generating attention for a cause you are passionate about can sometimes be a constructive supplement to going through typical channels.

Has feminism played a role in your life? If so, how?

I am a proud feminist. Gender inequality still exists and I really think that womens rights should be on everyones radar. I dont think gender should be used as an insult or a reason to treat a person as inferior. Its that simple. Understanding feminism has made me look at the world through a different lens, being conscious of the inherent divides and subconscious biases we hold.

If you could be any social media platform, which one would you be and why?

I would be Snapchat because it captures moments from people lives in raw and genuine ways.

msnbc.com,,"Iraq suicide attack: 47 dead, dozens injured in blast south of Baghdad",['Associated Press'],"BAGHDAD  A suicide bomber on Sunday rammed his explosives-laden fuel truck into a security checkpoint south of Baghdad, killing at least 47 people and wounding dozens, officials said, the latest episode in an uptick in violence in the war-ravaged country.

No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which bore the hallmarks of an ISIS attack. The militant group and other Sunni militants frequently use car bombs and suicide attacks to target public areas and government buildings in their bid to undermine confidence in the Shiite-led government in Baghdad.

Among the dead were 39 civilians, while the rest were members of the security forces. The attacker struck shortly after noon when the checkpoint at one of the entrances to the city of Hillah was crowded with dozens of cars, a police officer said.

He added that up to 65 other people were wounded and nearly 50 cars were damaged. Hillah is located about 60 miles south of Baghdad.

A medical official confirmed the causality figures. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release information.

Iraq has seen a spike in violence in the past month with suicide attacks in and outside Baghdad, all claimed by the ISIS, killing more than 170 people. ISIS controls large swaths of Iraq and neighboring Syria and has declared an Islamic caliphate on the territory it holds.

According to United Nations figures, at least 670 Iraqis were killed last month due to ongoing violence, of whom about two-thirds were civilians.

In the absence of special measures to screen for infection or reduce pathogens, the risk of Zika virus transmission through blood products is considered likely based on the most current scientific evidence of how Zika virus and similar viruses (flaviviruses) are spread, and what is currently being reported about transfusion-associated infection occurring outside of the United States, HHS said in a statement.

msnbc.com,,Senate Republicans rediscover the value of 'Pinata Politics',[],"Almost exactly 10 years ago, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) was concerned about Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito facing attacks from Senate Democrats. Eventually, the Texas Republican said at the time , senators will need to come to terms with our confirmation process. Cornyn added that treating nominees more like pinatas than human beings is something none of us should be willing to tolerate.

That was when there was a Republican president in the White House. Now that President Obama is the one doing the nominating, Cornyn is apparently less concerned about Pinata Politics.

Even though Senate Republicans have no intention of holding hearings on President Barack Obamas Supreme Court nominee, that doesnt mean he or she wont be dragged through the mud. And the chambers No. 2 Republican made that clear to a small cluster of reporters Monday, saying he believed the nominee, will bear some resemblance to a pinata.

A decade ago, Cornyn characterized this as something none of us should be willing to tolerate, but this year, one gets the impression that the Senate Majority Whip not only tolerates the same practices he denounced. he also intends to be one of the lawmakers holding the stick, swinging for candy.

White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was unimpressed with the rhetoric. Senator Cornyn has now taken the next step and suggested  without knowing who this nominee is, without considering what their record is, what their experience is, how qualified they are for the job  he is suggesting that theyll be subjected to bashing by Republicans, Earnest told reporters yesterday. Its unclear for what reason, other than the president of the United States has chosen to fulfill his constitutional responsibility to nominate someone to fill a vacancy.

That said, if Cornyn and the GOPs tolerance for Pinata Politics is intended to intimidate potential nominees  Its a nice career you have there, itd be a shame if we had to beat you with a stick  it might be working.

Nevada Gov. Brian Sandovals (R) was floated as a possible choice for the Supreme Court, though he soon after withdrew his name from consideration. Yesterday, as MSNBC reported , a high-profile member of the presidents cabinet did the same thing.

U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch has asked not to be considered for nomination to the Supreme Court to take the spot formerly occupied by the late Justice Antonin Scalia, the Justice Department said Tuesday.

Today, The Hill reported that another possible contender also bowed out.

msnbc.com,,Sanders' surprise win and Clinton's defeat: What happened in Michigan?,[],"NBC News Kristen Welker, Kasie Hunt, Monica Alba, and Danny Freeman contributed reporting.

Theres no such thing as a sure bet in politics, but Michigan certainly seemed like one for Hillary Clinton. The Real Clear Politics average of recent polls had her up by more than 21 points on Election Day, and the data whizzes at FiveThirtyEight gave her a 99 percent chance of winning the race. (After Sanders won, they also called it one of the greatest upsets in modern political history.)

Even the Sanders campaign was bracing for defeat, and spent Tuesday pre-spinning a loss while the Clinton campaign gained little traction arguing the race was closer than expected.

RELATED: Michigan win rescues Bernie Sanders campaign

When exhausted Sanders staffers reached their hotel in Miami Tuesday night, they were stunned to find their candidate ahead in early returns and scrambled to assemble a podium so he could address the press. As Clinton gave a speech in Cleveland that did not mention Michigan, seemingly frustrated aides focused on Clintons large net delegate win in Mississippi, which held a primary on the same day.

So what happened? Both campaigns are still picking over the wreckage for clues, but heres what we know so far about how Sanders net an unexpected victory.

Sanders went all in, Clinton took her eye off the ball: Clinton seemed to take Michigan for granted after a string of big wins, leading her to begin turning to the general election. Team Sanders, meanwhile, saw Michigan as a must-win and invested accordingly. They outspent Clinton by about $500,000 on TV and spent almost three times as much on radio ads in the final week of the campaign as they had during any week in any state up to now.

Sanders brass deployed two veteran operatives  Robert Becker, who ran Sanders campaign in Iowa, and Julia Barnes, who ran his New Hampshire campaign  to help organize the state, and built a robust ground operation.

Clinton invested less heavily in her field program, which largely focused on African-Americans. Some supporters worried when they saw few Clinton yard signs, and some volunteers grumbled about disorganization and under-resourcing, but the realization of a major problem didnt come soon enough.

In closing days, the campaign scrambled to bring in reinforcements. They redirected Bill and Chelsea Clinton to spend more time in the state, and called on Michigan allies to rally troops. But it was too little, too late.

On a conference call with reporters Wednesday, Clintons campaign manager Robby Mook pushed back on that notion. Were proud of the ground game we ran, he said.

Geography: Clinton spent virtually all of her time in Detroit, along with a church visit in Flint last month and a small visit to a software company in Grand Rapids. Bill and Chelsea Clinton hit other parts of the state in the final push, but the candidate herself didnt hold any public rallies outside of Detroit during the entire campaign.

RELATED: Ghetto gaffe highlights Sanders campaigns struggle with race

While Clinton focused on population centers, Sanders allies said the candidate and his team did a better job of activating voters across the state. He won 73 of Michigans 83 counties (though Clinton won the most populous ones), and ran up large margins in counties that include Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor.

Despite making Flint the soul of her Michigan campaign, Clinton didnt hold a single open event in the city during her five days in the state leading up to Tuesday. She also did not attend the watch party her campaign organized after Sundays debate in Flint, as she has in other states, disappointing some attendees.

Inroads with African-American voters: African-Americans have been determinative of the Democratic primary so far, and may have been in Michigan, too. Clinton was once again banking on black voters, but Sanders performed better with that group in Michigan than he did in the South. He still lost black votes 68 to 38, but thats 20 points better than he did with that voting bloc in Mississippi. They also made up a slightly smaller proportion of the vote than expected.

Sanders core supporters turned out big: Young people, Sanders most important voting bloc, turned out in larger-than-expected numbers, with those younger than 30 making up the same portion of the electorate as those older than 65. Sanders visited every college town in the state, turning out huge crowds when he did, which the campaign says proves their point that they can move the needle anywhere they move their candidate.

And Sanders did better than usual among those slightly older, winning 53 percent of those between the ages of 30 and 44.

Michigans open primary allows independents to vote in either party, and Sanders always does well among among independents. He performed even better than expected with that group on Tuesday, winning 71 percent of independents casting ballots in the Democratic primary.

Some speculate that Clinton supporters were complacent and stayed home, or possibly even voted in the Republican primary in an attempt to stop Trump.

The weather: It was an unseasonably warm 70 degrees in much of the state on Election Day, helping to push up turnout in both partys primaries to record levels. More than 2.5 million voters participated in the Republican and Democratic primaries, shattering the record of 1.93 million set in the 1972 primary and the expected 2 million turnout.

Fertile ground for Sanders message: Late-deciders broke for Sanders and most pollsters had stopped contacting voters on Sunday. Michigan was a perfect place for Sanders message because of its Rust Belt history and relatively friendly demographics. His emphasis on unpopular free trade deals and his performance in Sunday nights debate, while panned by some analysts, could have changed minds.

The Sanders campaign also believes Clintons charge (which they called misleading and unfair) that he voted against the auto bailout backfired. The auto rescue was included in the Wall Street bailout bill, which Sanders voted against, and they believe hitting on him on the issue played into the idea that she is dishonest and reminded voters of Wall Street. Mook rejected that claim outright. Well continue to talk about it, he said.",[]

As has been often noted, Trump is a celebrity  and he boasts a fair amount of star supporters for a Republican candidate. Still, the quality of his endorsers may not always match the quantity.

RELATED: But what about the children, Mr. Trump?

Here are a few of the less-than-illustrious celebrities who have backed his presidential bid:

Mike Tyson - The former heavyweight champion turned comedic actor (and cartoon character), who has been friendly with Trump for decades, made the case that the real estate mogul should be president last fall. Lets try something new. Lets run America like a business, where no colors matter, he told The Huffington Post. He also had no problem with Trumps controversial rhetoric about Latinos and other ethnic groups, saying: Hes an average guy like everybody else.

Gary Busey - The eccentric character actor, whose past battles with addiction have been well-documented, said I know him personally. I know him professionally. Hes a great guy. Hes sharp. Hes fast. He can change the country after the last eight years during an appearance on Fox News in September. The Point Break actor appeared on two editions of Trumps reality TV show Celebrity Apprentice, and the GOP candidate once joked that hed make a good Supreme Court justice.

Omarosa Manigault - Speaking of The Apprentice, the biggest breakout star of that franchise had also thrown her weight behind The Donald. Despite being a Democrat who once worked in the Clinton White House, Manigault appeared alongside Trump and a group of black ministers last December and declared: Donald Trump is committed to the black community. Manigault, who has now become an ordained minister, later told talk show host Steve Harvey: I know him as a friend, as a mentor, as a father. 

Tila Tequila - Another reality TV show star and frequent source of tabloid fodder, endorsed Trump on YouTube because of his anti-vaccination positions. In case you forgot, three years ago Tequila lit a social media firestorm after expressing an affinity for Adolf Hitler as well as posting an image of herself holding a gun in front of a backdrop of the World War II concentration camp Auschwitz. She has also alleged that actor Paul Walker was ritualistically murdered.

Hulk Hogan - Although the wrestling icon  and current litigant in a high profile case against Gawker  has endorsed President Barack Obama in the past, this year he is all in with Trump. In fact, last summer he volunteered to be the real estate moguls running mate. But it remains to be seen whether Trump should want Hogans endorsement. After all, audio from a leaked sex tape featuring the aging wrestler reportedly shows him spewing racist invective and using the N-word.

Jon Voight - The Oscar winning actor, who was a liberal at the height of his career in the 1970s, has since morphed into one of Obamas harshest critics in Hollywood. He has accused the president of causing a civil war and tearing the country apart, frequently singling out his handling of Israel for attack. The Midnight Cowboy actor once penned an open letter to the president in which he said Obama promoted anti-Semitism throughout the world.  In a self-released video which came out this month last year, Voight claimed: President Obama does not love Israel. His whole agenda is to control Israel, he said in a self-released video this month last year. On Wednesday, Voight told Breitbart News, regarding Trump: Hes an answer to our problems. We need to get behind him.

Willie Robertson - One of the members of the Duck Dynasty reality TV show family, Willie Robertson came out in support of Trump in January. His father, who famously was suspended from the show for a homophobic tirade, has backed Sen. Ted Cruz. Willie Roberston has said in the past that hes trying to figure out if being gay is a choice. Heres the deal. Were both successful businessmen. We both have pretty big shows on television. We both have wives that are 1,000 times better looking than us, so I like Trump, he said earlier last year.

Stephen Baldwin - The veteran character actor is another former Celebrity Apprentice contestant  notice a pattern here. He has claimed in the past that his far right politics  which put him odds with some of his famous brothers  has cost him roles in Hollywood, and in recent years he has been more prominent as a religious conservative than a working actor. On Trump hes said: I think hes fantastic. I love him. I think hed make a great president. Hes not a politician, and he doesnt care what anybody thinks. And thats why hes surging in the polls. He says what he thinks.



Jesse James - This endorser combines several elements of the prototypical celebrity Trump endorser. Hes a former Celebrity Apprentice contestant. He was a reality star in his own right prior to that (thanks to his now defunct bodyshop shows). And he too was caught up in a very public scandal involving racial insensitivity. In the aftermath of his ugly split with former wife actress Sandra Bullock, a photo of James dressed in Nazi regalia while doing the infamous Heil Hitler salute was unearthed. James later called his participation in the picture a joke. On Trump, hes said: This guy is the real deal, and will make America great again.



Kid Rock - The Detroit-based rock-rapper, who has been pilloried for brandishing the Confederate flag at his concerts in the past, has been very public about his support for GOP candidates previously. They say Obama is lyin/ Thats why Im voting for Romney and Ryan, he rapped in 2012. He told Rolling Stone last month: Im digging Trump. I feel like a lot of people, whether youre a Democrat or a Republican, feel like if you get Hillary or Bernie, or you get Rubio or Cruz or whoever, theres going to be the same sh*t.



Dennis Rodman - The NBA Hall of Famer, who nearly caused an international incident when he cozied up to North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in 2013, has made no secret of his distaste for President Obama. And, you guessed it, he too was a contestant on Trumps popular reality TV series Celebrity Apprentice. Trump was one of the few prominent figures to praise Rodmans North Korea trip and the TK-NBA champion returned the favor by endorsing the real estate mogul early, tweeting in July: @realDonaldTrump has been a great friend for many years. We dont need another politician, we need a businessman like Mr. Trump! Trump 2016.

Ted Nugent - The virulently pro-gun rock musician has called President Obama a subhuman mongrel and his supporters pimps, whores and welfare brats. He has argued that African-Americans have a mindless propensity towards violence and suggested that the late Trayvon Martin, an unarmed teen shot and killed in 2012, got justice. Still, the one thing that appears to be brightening his disposition is the candidacy of Trump. He would kick a** and take names, and thats what America needs right now, Nugent said during an appearance on The Rita Cosby Show last July.

Honorable mention: Tom Brady - The NFL superstar, who spent much of last off-season battling accusations that he had sought an illegal advantage through the use of deflated footballs, has not endorsed Trump, but hes not not endorsed him either. The polarizing New England Patriots quarterback has been playing footsie with the Trump campaign for months. He was caught with Make America Great Again swag and has praised Trump repeatedly.

But with its competitors raising their bottom wages as well, that was no longer enough. On an earnings call, chief executive Robert Galanti explained that Costco reviews its payscale every three years, and usually raises just the top end  which right now is about $22.50. This year, they were boosting the floor as well, by $1.50, to $13.

Vox had a good piece last year, after Wal-Mart made a related announcement, noting that developments like these signal that companies want to keep attracting good talent and keep its workforce from departing to competitors, which in turn signals that theres increased competition to get good workers.

The actual job numbers have been very encouraging of late, and every time companies like Costco raise their wages, its further evidence of a healthy labor market.

I realize, of course, that conservative readers are very likely pointing to this as proof of the free market working: congressional Republicans refuse to consider even a modest increase in the federal minimum wage, but in practical terms, the argument goes, it doesnt much matter since private employers are making these decisions on their own based on the business cycle.

And while this is a nice argument, lets not forget that plenty of American workers arent employed by one of the companies that have voluntarily approved an increase, which means those other folks are being left behind. For that matter, lets also remember that without legal guarantees, the whims of the market may lead to reduced wages the next time theres an economic downturn.

In other words, the case for a federal increase hasnt really changed.",[]

msnbc.com,,"Elizabeth Garrett, Cornell's first female president, dies of colon cancer",['Elizabeth Chuck'],"Cornell University President Elizabeth Garrett has died from colon cancer, the university said, less than a month after announcing her diagnosis and just eight months after she assumed her post. She was 52.

Garrett, the first female president of the Ivy League school, died Sunday night at her home in New York City, Cornell said.

There are few words to express the enormity of this loss, Robert Harrison, chairman of the Cornell board of trustees, said on Monday. Beth was simply a remarkable human being  a vibrant and passionate leader who devoted her life to the pursuit of knowledge and public service.

Garrett started as president on July 1, 2015, and was inaugurated last September. She revealed on Feb. 8 that she had recently been diagnosed with cancer, and had surgery on Feb. 19 before starting aggressive treatment at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City.

The university said she is the first president to die in office there.

Garrett made a strong impression on academics and politicians alike. Prior to becoming Cornells president, she was a provost and senior vice president for academic affairs at the University of Southern California  the first woman to hold that title, too.

In 2005, President George W. Bush appointed her to serve on the bipartisan Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform. From 2009 to 2013, she was commissioner of the California Fair Political Practices Commission.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo called her a visionary leader in a statement Monday.

Elizabeths passing is a great loss not only for her university, but for our state, he said.

Garrett focused on attracting top faculty to Cornell during her short tenure, saying last October that the university was on track to hire up to 100 new faculty members this school year.

An Oklahoma City native who got her bachelors degree from the University of Oklahoma and a law degree from the Virginia School of Law, Garrett was once a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She told Times Higher Education magazine in 2014 she hoped to be a role model for young people.

Being the first woman president of Cornell, just as I was the first woman provost at U.S.C., puts me in the position of being a role model  not just for young women, but also for men, she said. It is important for women and men to see strong and capable women in positions of leadership, so we understand that certain characteristics such as gender and race do not determine how well people do in those offices. Garrett was married to Andrei Marmor, a Cornell professor of law. The university held a moment of silence for her Monday afternoon.",[]

msnbc.com,,#WachowskiSisters: Second member of 'Matrix' directing duo comes out as trans,[],"On Tuesday, the filmmaker formerly known as Andy Wachowski announced to the world via a statement to the Windy City News that she is transgender and will be using the first name Lily from now on.

She is the second member of the sibling directing duo  formerly known as the Wachowski brothers  to come out as transgender. Lana Wachowski made her public debut as trans in 2012. The directors, best known for the blockbuster Matrix trilogy, now arguably represent the most famous trans figures behind the camera in Hollywood.

Second Wachowski sibling comes out as transgender https://t.co/vVn5ToEZZ6 pic.twitter.com/BabuDJAMi7  Variety (@Variety) March 9, 2016

The 48-year-old Lilly told the Windy City News that the decision to go public now was an attempt to get in front of media outlets telling her story before she could.  SEX CHANGE SHOCKERWACHOWSKI BROTHERS NOW SISTERS!!! Theres the headline Ive been waiting for this past year. Up until now with dread and/or eye rolling exasperation, Lilly Wachowski wrote. The news has almost come out a couple of times. Each was preceded by an ominous email from my agentreporters have been asking for statements regarding the Andy Wachowski gender transition story they were about to publish. In response to this threatened public outing against my will, I had a prepared a statement that was one part piss, one part vinegar and 12 parts gasoline.

RELATED: Study: Film industry still a straight, white, boys club

But when publications didnt out her after all, she held back. Then on Monday night, according to Wachowski, she was confronted by a reporter claiming to be with the UK gossip publication The Daily Mail. Wachowski alleges that the writer pleaded with her to give him an interview about her gender status. Wachowski recalled that the publication had demonized Lucy Meadows, a British elementary school teacher who happened to be trans, in 2013. Three months after The Daily Mail published a column about Meadows titled, Hes not only trapped in the wrong body ... hes in the wrong job, she committed suicide.

A spokesman for The Daily Mail has denied in an official statement that they in any way tried to coerce Lily Wachowski into revealing her gender transition and insisted that their reporter was extremely sympathetic and courteous at all times. Dear Lily Wachowski: Sorry your trans-ness warranted tabloid threats, but welcome to the sisterhood! https://t.co/UODZvO9aID #girlslikeus  Janet Mock (@janetmock) March 9, 2016

I am one of the lucky ones. Having the support of my family and the means to afford doctors and therapists has given me the chance to actually survive this process, wrote Wachowski. And so, in part because she believes her coming out can combat the notion that trans people are predators, she decided to go public.

Im out to my friends and family. Most people at work know too. Everyone is cool with it. Yes, thanks to my fabulous sister theyve done it before, but also because theyre fantastic people. Without the love and support of my wife and friends and family I would not be where I am today, she wrote.

Her statement has inspired an outpouring of support on social media, and has been hailed as a significant landmark for an industry that has been recently exposed as incredibly deficient when it comes to LGBT representation both on camera and in leadership roles. A recent University of Southern California study found that seven or less than 1 percent  of 11,194 characters in 414 movies, television shows and digital series that they monitored were identified as transgender, and four of the characters came from a single show.

And as Vox has pointed out, the Wachowski sisters films have shown a willingness to portray gender fluidity (2012s Cloud Atlas) and LGBT relationships (1996s Bound) in unconventional narratives. Even the duos most famous work is filled with allusions to identity being a construct, wrote Todd VanDerWerff. The Matrix trilogy is full of characters who are one thing in reality, but quite another within the computer simulation of the matrix, to say nothing of the way that the reality of the computer simulation gives way to something else once you realize the truth.

My reality is that Ive been transitioning and will continue to transition all of my life, through the infinite that exists between male and female as it does in the infinite between the binary of zero and one, wrote Wachowski. We need to elevate the dialogue beyond the simplicity of binary. Binary is a false idol.",[]
msnbc.com,,"How Trump, Rubio and Cruz would fare against Clinton in November",[],"Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders would handily defeat Donald Trump in a general election match-up, while a clash between Clinton and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio would be a toss-up, according to a new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.

The poll shows that Trump, who frequently boasts in interviews and campaign appearances that he would beat Clinton in November, would lose a one-on-one contest against her by double digits. In a head-to-head fight, Clinton gets the support of 51 percent of registered voters compared to 38 percent for the real estate mogul.

For Sanders, the margin of victory would be even greater, the poll shows.

The Vermont senator gets 55 percent support in a hypothetical two-person race against Trump, while the GOP front-runner would get just 37 percent.

While Trump remains the front-runner for the GOP nomination, Republicans like former presidential contender Mitt Romney have urged their partys voters to back Cruz or Rubio, whom they say would have a greater chance of defeating the Democratic nominee.

The NBC/WSJ data supports that theory; both Cruz and Rubio would be competitive with the former secretary of state, both running within the margin of error in hypothetical general election battles against Clinton.

In a matchup with Cruz, Clinton would receive the support of 47 percent of registered voters, compared to 45 percent for the Texas senator.

If pitted against Rubio, Clinton and the Florida would tie at 46 percent support apiece, the poll shows.

The poll also shows that voters are split over whether they would consider a third party candidate in the presidential contest.

Forty-six percent of voters surveyed said that they would consider a third-party or independent candidate, while 51 percent said they would not consider it.

On Monday, the most prominent potential independent candidate, former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, shut the door on a 2016 run, saying that he feared his inclusion in the race would ultimately help Trump win the presidency over the Democratic nominee.",[]

msnbc.com,,Bill Gates: Apple could propose a balance in FBI dispute,['Matthew Deluca'],"Bill Gates answered some questions about Apples ongoing dispute with the FBI during a Reddit Ask Me Anything on Tuesday  and stuck solidly to the same neutral position hes maintained in earlier comments.

I think there needs to be a discussion about when the government should be able to gather information, Gates said in response to one Redditors question. What if we had never had wiretapping? Also the government needs to talk openly about safeguards.

Im hard at work on my latest @reddit_AMA. Join me now: https://t.co/vbmpSKQMgM pic.twitter.com/Fd8G3yqDQQ  Bill Gates (@BillGates) March 8, 2016

Gates first gave his thoughts on the matter  in which Apple is refusing a court order to help the FBI unlock an iPhone used by one of the shooters in San Bernardino  in a Feb. 23 interview with the Financial Times. The Microsoft co-founder later said that he felt those quotes, which were widely characterized as putting him in the FBIs camp, did not accurately represent his full opinion on the case.

Gates answers on Tuesday, much like those he gave in another interview with Bloomberg TV, also didnt do much to clear up where the tech pioneer personally stands on the contentious case. Asked what he would do if he were in Apples position, Gates said the company could offer a Plan B.

Maybe they could propose an overall plan for striking the balance between government being able to know things in some cases and having safeguards to make sure those powers are confined to appropriate cases, Gates said. There is no avoiding this debate and they could contribute to how the balance should be struck.

Gates is no longer involved in the day-to-day operations of Microsoft, which along with nearly every other major tech company has filed a friend of the court brief supporting Apple in the California case.

msnbc.com,,Caitlyn Jenner's Clinton slam is latest example of conservative streak,[],"After emerging as an icon of the trans community last year, Caitlyn Jenner has become increasingly vocal about the 2016 presidential race, although her political allegiances may come as a surprise to some LGBT rights advocates.

On the premiere episode of the second season of her reality TV series, I Am Cait, Jenner unloaded on Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton during a heated argument with one of her peers. If were unfortunate enough get Hillary as our next president, we need her on our side, the 66-year-old said, before adding that she wont be.

She couldnt care less about women, she only cares about herself, she added.

RELATED: Caitlyn Jenner to publish memoir in 2017

Ironically, Jenner has expressed an affinity for the candidacy of Sen. Ted Cruz who has shown very public, stubborn resistance to the notion of equal rights for trans citizens. Last fall he described making schools more accommodating to trans students lunacy and accused the Justice Department of trying to force [school districts] to let boys shower with little girls. And in January he harped on the restroom issue again, arguing that when it comes to a male transgender students they should use faculty facilities because inflicting him on the teachers is probably better than sticking him in the shower with the teenage girls.

You know, the funny thing is, my 5-year-old knows theres a difference between boys and girls, Cruz said on a conservative radio show last November. And yet modern leftists cant figure that out.

In 2014, the LGBT publication The Advocate named Cruz the Phobie of the Year for his vociferous opposition to same-sex marriage rights and for introducing a bill that February that would amount to essentially unmarrying any couple who set foot in a state without marriage equality.

Nevertheless, Jenner has said Cruz is a great constitutionalist, and a very articulate man, although she concedes that is probably one of the worst ones when it comes to trans issues. She went on to volunteer herself to be a trans ambassador for the Cruz campaign.

Jenners transition made her a bit of cause celebre in some left-wing circles, which appears to make the reality star, who identified herself as a longtime Republican during a high profile interview with Diane Sawyer last April, uncomfortable.

Were 18 and 1/2 trillion dollars in debt, our economys going to collapse, she said on her show. Sometimes these girls think that now that I have transitioned that everything has to change. You cant be conservative anymore, you have to be a liberal. No, I dont believe that. I think I can keep all of my views the same because I feel in my heart thats the way to go.

Jenner echoed similar sentiments when defending Cruz in a separate interview with The Advocate. Number one, if we dont have a country, we dont have trans issues, she said, adding later: Socialism did not build this country. Capitalism did. Free enterprise. The people built it. And they need to be given the opportunity to build it back up. She has acknowledged that Democrats have been the better party when it comes to addressing the rights of the LGBT community, but argues that Republicans are just worried about much bigger issues than the trans issues.

Some critics have argued that Jenner has long benefited from her considerable wealth and white privilege, and that dichotomy has continued since she transitioned, while trans women of color and those who live in impoverished circumstances are still subject to disproportionate discrimination and violence in their communities.

Im white. I make a good living. And I get all that. Ive heard that right from the beginning. Im not going to make excuses for myself. Im very happy that Ive worked very hard in my life and Im successful. Its kind of the American dream, Jenner told TIME last December. Were fortunate to live in a country where we can do that. Im very proud of what I was able to accomplish in my life. But Im also smart in the sense that I know how to use that to make everything better.

However, not everyone is impressed. Last month, Jenner got a mixed reception from an audience of University of Pennsylvania students when she reportedly claimed, I have gotten more flak for being a conservative Republican than I have for being trans.

The fact that she equated two completely different issues, invalidating one by doing so, is a problem in itself, College freshman Kenneth Lac reportedly told The Daily Pennsylvanian after the event.

Meanwhile, she has also expressed some ambivalence about same-sex marriage, telling talk show host Ellen DeGeneres last September: Im a traditionalist. Im older than most people in the audience. I kind of like tradition, and its always been a man and a woman. Im thinking, I dont quite get it.

Later, Jenner clarified her opinion in a blog post. Like many people, there was a time when I didnt realize how important it is for gay couples to have the right to get married. But after hearing from my gay friends and learning more about the hardships they faced because of discrimination, it became clear to me that everyone should be able to marry the person they love, she wrote. I can only hope that by sharing my story, theres someone out there whose mind has been changed about trans people.",[]

The dead were among the 200 or so fighters at a training camp some 120 miles north of Mogadishu who were preparing for an imminent large-scale attack against U.S. and regional governmental forces, officials told NBC News.

While the officials did not identify the al-Shabab targets, American special forces have been training Somali forces in the east African nation.

It appeared the group was in formation and conducting some kind of ceremony when American drones dropped bombs and launched Hellfire missiles at the al-Shabab militants, the officials said.

It was not clear whether any senior al-Shabab leaders were killed in the strikes.

msnbc.com,,Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder responds to Democratic debate,[],"Embattled Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder said he is committed to the people of Flint after Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton criticized him over his handling of the citys ongoing lead water crisis during a debate Sunday.

In the coming days, political candidates will be leaving Flint and Michigan, the Republican governor said in a statement on Sunday. They will not be staying to help solve the crisis, but I am committed to the people of Flint. I will fix this crisis and help move Flint forward. Long-term solutions are what the people of Flint need and what I am focused on delivering for them.

Snyder argued that he has proposed more than $230 million dollars in spending on resources for Flint residents, and supplied more than 439,000 cases of bottled water.

Both Sanders and Clinton used their opening statements to urge Snyder to resign.

Even though she has been critical of the governor, Sunday was the first time Clinton said Snyder should step resign or be recalled.

And we should support the efforts of citizens to achieve that, she added.

The debate came two days before Michigan voters head to the polls in the states primary. During the debate, Sanders and Clinton took questions from audience members who asked them about their plans to aid the city.

Snyders handling of the water crisis has also triggered protests and calls for him to be indicted. For more than a year, residents complained about the taste, smell and appearance of the water. But officials told them the water was safe. Tests later found that thousands of children have been exposed to high contamination levels of lead.

Snyder had apologized to residents for a contaminated water supply, but defended himself, saying that it was not brought to his attention until January. However, emails that were obtained by a local watchdog group revealed that one of Snyders advisers knew about a possible connection between Flints highly contaminated water supply and the surge in diagnosed cases of Legionnaires disease in the area since last March.",[]

Related: In Flint, both Clinton and Sanders call for Michigan Gov. Snyder to resign

The omission was striking, given that Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton is a former secretary of state, fully conversant on these topics. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has shown less comfort on these issues, but he has not been shy to criticize Clinton for being too hawkish in her views on foreign affairs.



Sanders has often pointed to Clintons vote in favor of authorizing the Iraq war while she served as a U.S. senator from New York and her role later in pushing President Obama to launch an air campaign over Libya in 2011. Clinton, Sanders said during a debate in October, is too into regime change.

But on Sunday there were next to no fireworks on this issue. During the debates opening minutes, Sanders briefly worked in a reference to the Iraq war, asking why the United States paid trillions of dollars for that war while it neglects problems at home.

msnbc.com,,"Christie camp held Sandy relief money hostage, mayor alleges",[],"Two senior members of Gov. Chris Christies administration warned a New Jersey mayor earlier this year that her town would be starved of hurricane relief money unless she approved a lucrative redevelopment plan favored by the governor, according to the mayor and emails and personal notes she shared with msnbc.

The mayor, Dawn Zimmer, hasnt approved the project, but she did request $127 million in hurricane relief for her city of Hoboken  80% of which was underwater after Sandy hit in October 2012. What she got was $142,000 to defray the cost of a single back-up generator plus an additional $200,000 in recovery grants.

Close video Mayor: Christie camp held Sandy money Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer says that top officials in Chris Christies administration have told her that her city will only receive critical Sandy relief funds if she expedites a redevelopment project in north Hoboken. Its not fair for the governor to... embed like save share group

In an exclusive interview, Zimmer broke her silence and named Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno and Richard Constable, Christies community affairs commissioner, as the two officials who delivered messages on behalf of a governor she had long supported.

The bottom line is, its not fair for the governor to hold Sandy funds hostage for the City of Hoboken because he wants me to give back to one private developer, she said Saturday on UP w/ Steve Kornacki. ... I know its very complicated for the public to really understand all of this, but I have a legal obligation to follow the law, to bring balanced development to Hoboken.

Constable and Christie  through spokespersons  deny Zimmers claims.

Mayor Zimmer has been effusive in her public praise of the Governors Office and the assistance weve provided in terms of economic development and Sandy aid, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak wrote in a statement. What or who is driving her only now to say such outlandishly false things is anyones guess.

Christies office later issued a second statement attacking MSNBC. MSNBC is a partisan network that has been openly hostile to Governor Christie and almost gleeful in their efforts attacking him, even taking the unprecedented step of producing and airing a nearly three-minute attack ad against him this week, spokesman Colin Reed said.

Zimmers statements and documentation suggest that Christies administration  hailed for what seemed like a heroic response to Hurricane Sandy  in fact refused to help some of the neediest.

Id be more than willing to testify under oath and  and answer any questions and provide any documents, take a lie detector test, Zimmer said, referring to the Christie administrations denials. And, you know, my question back to them is, Would all of you? Would all of you be willing do that same thing, to testify under oath, to take a lie detector test?

Zimmers interview comes on the heels of a scandal in which other members of Christies inner circle conspired to create huge traffic swells, possibly in an act of political retribution, on another New Jersey town on the outskirts of Manhattan.

Christie, who sailed to re-election last year and has made no secret of his presidential ambitions, has denied any knowledge of the plot that shut down lanes at the foot of the George Washington Bridge, one of the most heavily trafficked in the country. His office and several former senior aides are currently the subject of a number of federal and state inquiries into what has become known as Bridge-gate.

RELATED: Whos who on the Bridge-gate subpoena list

In this account  supported by email, public records and Zimmers own diary entries  Christies inner circle was willing to cut off devastated constituents, muscle a friendly mayor and arrange public funds to finance a study for a project the governor supported.In a news conference last week, Christie rejected the notion that his administration engages in retribution or seeks political payback. Zimmers account paints a different portrait.

Zimmer claims they leaned on her twice to get their way. By the second encounter, Zimmer said  this time with Constable  the 45-year-old mayor and mother of two young children was despondent, according to her own notes.

I was emotional about governor Christie, she wrote in a diary entry she provided that is dated May 17, 2013. I thought he was honest. I thought he was moral. I thought he was something very different. This week I found out hes cut from the same corrupt cloth that I have been fighting for the last four years.

New Jersey Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone told UP Saturday that Zimmers accusations suggest an abuse of power by the Christie administration. This is something that the U.S. attorney should be looking at, and has to be further investigated, he said.

Zimmer and Christie

Among the great ironies in the latest claims about the New Jersey governor is that without Christie, Zimmer would not likely have become the mayor of Hoboken.

What pole-vaulted her to the Mayors Office was a corruption scandal five years ago that enveloped a number of New Jersey politicians, including Zimmers predecessor. The investigation, which netted high profile convictions, was launched by the U.S. Attorneys office then led by Christie. By the time of the arrests in 2009, Christie had already resigned from office to run for governor. But it helped boost his image as tough on corruption and crime.

For Zimmer, it was a welcome sign for New Jerseys future and while she is a Democrat, she became a Christie supporter.

Swept into office from the city council, Zimmer inherited preliminary plans for a redevelopment project supported by the previous mayor.

The deal, as envisioned in 2008, would have awarded the Rockefeller Group  a New York developer  the right to redevelop a stretch of Hoboken. The project would have been eligible for tax incentives and it would have given the Rockefeller Group a much freer hand to build whatever they wanted while asking for millions in subsidies. If done right, it would have been an immensely lucrative deal in a town that has become a hip bedroom community of Manhattan.

Zimmer wasnt against the deal but she wanted a professional study done on the projected development. The problem was that Hobokens finances were in disarray and she wanted to wait until the community was on sounder footing before spending the money for a study.

Zimmer told the Rockefeller Group theyd have to follow the same process as everybody else. That process couldnt start until the city had enough money to pay professionals  planners and engineers  to study the issue.

The sides were at an impasse: the Rockefeller Group had big plans for hugely valuable land but Zimmer wasnt moving forward on it yet.

The dispute became public and thats when the Christie administration came in. Lori Grifa, who in 2010 served as Christies first community affairs commissioner, went to Hoboken that June and told Zimmer the administration might be able to help track down a source to pay for the study.

Soon enough, the Christie administration connected Zimmer to the Port Authority  the same jointly run New Jersey-New York agency that operates the George Washington Bridge, and is littered, on the New Jersey side, with Christies political appointees.

On Dec. 28, 2010, the Port Authority approved a $75,000 grant for the study but there was a catch. The Port Authority alone would choose the firm that conducted the study. In February 2011, it selected Clarke Caton Hintz  a reputable firm  to carry out the redevelopment study. It took a long time: the rest of 2011 and all through 2012, with Hurricane Sandy slowing things down.

Finally, in January 2013, the firm  which was tasked with evaluating a 19-block area  concluded that only the three blocks in which the Rockefeller Group had an ownership stake were fit for redevelopment.

Zimmers team was concerned. The landowners for the other 16 blocks were angry. They hired a lawyer who called the study curious, disturbing and suspect to the say the least.

The Rockefeller Group had its own representation  Wolff & Samson  the most powerful, politically connected law firm in all of New Jersey. Its heavily involved in development deals and its known for its close, intimate ties to the Christie administration. It is the firm of David Samson, the chairman of the Port Authority, the former attorney general of New Jersey, and a Christie appointee whos coming under increasing scrutiny in the Bridge-gate scandal.

The firm is also now the professional home of Lori Grifa, the former Christie aide who now lobbies on behalf of the Rockefeller Group.

Our client, The Rockefeller Group, has specifically asked us to speak with you regarding its property in Hoboken, Grifa emailed an attorney employed by Hoboken in early 2012.

Over many months, Grifa kept up the heat on Hoboken, with calls and email pressing for a decision on the project.

By April 5, 2013, Joe Marazati, the Hoboken lawyer, wrote to Zimmers director of community development. I am getting the full court press on this, Marazati wrote in an email. I have a voice mail from last night from Lori asking that I join a call this am with Lori and Dave Samson (chair of the PA) or suggest another time.

Email obtained by msnbc shows a raft of exchanges between the town of Hoboken and the law firm until May 8 when the Hoboken Planning Board voted 4-3 against the project, finding insufficient evidence to designate those three blocks for redevelopment.

Instead, the board declared the entire 19 block area in need of rehabilitation. The designation didnt make it impossible for the Rockefeller Group to get what it wanted but it was a strong signal that Zimmers team wasnt going to roll over for them.

In a statement to msnbc, a spokesman for the Rockefeller Group said: We have no knowledge of any information pertaining to this allegation. If it turns out to be true it would be deplorable.

Sandy Aid

At the same time that the planning board voted against the study, Zimmer was applying for funding from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, a huge vault of money overseen by Christie to help communities hit hard by Sandy prepare themselves for the next storm.

After Sandy hit, in Hobokens darkest hour, Christie came to town and told residents they could count on him.

I spoke to the mayor this morning, and I told her Hoboken is in the front of my mind, and whenever theres any assistance thats needed here, Ill be here to help.

Christies people came back with less than 1% of what Hoboken had sought. With $250 million to disburse statewide, just $142,000 went to Hoboken  enough to help defray the cost of one backup generator to power a flood pump. Out of another pool of money for recovery grants  $1.8 billion in all  Hoboken received $200,000.Hoboken is perched above the mouth of the Hudson River, directly across from lower Manhattan. Following Christies visit, city officials submitted seven letters of intent for around $100 million in funds from programs the state was now running. Among the requests were money for storm surge coastal protection, money to buy properties to be used as open space and money for backup generators.

Please governor, Zimmer wrote in a letter following the decisions, we need your help. I have tried to assure Hoboken residents that we would be treated fairly because you have always treated Hoboken fairly in the past.

There was no response to that letter, dated May 8 of last year, the same day the Hoboken Planning Board did not adopt the redevelopment recommendation for the Rockefeller property.

Two days later, Zimmer got a call from the Lieutenant Governor, Kim Guadagno, who wanted to come to town to do an event at a ShopRite to spotlight businesses that had recovered from the storm.

On May 13, Guadagno and Zimmer met at the Hoboken ShopRite. That is where, Zimmer said, Guadagno delivered the first message about the relief aide.

Zimmer shared this diary entry which she said she wrote later that day. At the end of a big tour of ShopRite and meeting, she pulls me aside with no one else around and says that I need to move forward with the Rockefeller project. It is very important to the governor. The word is that you are against it and you need to move forward or we are not going to be able to help you. I know its not right  these things should not be connected  but they are, she says, and if you tell anyone, I will deny it.

The second warning, according to Zimmer, came four days later. She and Constable, who now led Christies department of community affairs, were seated together on stage for a for a NJTV public television special on Sandy Recovery.

Again, Zimmer provided this diary entry from May 17, which she said captured the incident.

We are miced up with other panelists all around us and probably the sound team is listening. And he says I hear you are against the Rockefeller project. I reply I am not against the Rockefeller project; in fact I want more commercial development in Hoboken. Oh really? Everyone in the State House believes you are against it  the buzz is that you are against it. If you move that forward, the money would start flowing to you he tells me.

Lisa M. Ryan, spokeswoman for Constable, said in a statement: Mayor Zimmers allegation that on May 16, 2013, Commissioner Constable conditioned Hobokens receipt of Sandy aid on her moving forward with a development project is categorically false.

Publicly, Zimmer has not spoken out against either Constable or Christie and the governors office was quick to point to two supportive tweets she wrote about the governor.

In the diary entry she shared, Zimmer concluded with these lines:

My beloved governor who wants to run for President. I cannot understand it. Why is he so concerned about Rockfeller? What has he promised them? What have they promised him? I cannot figure it out but I have no option but to stand up to him.

msnbc.com,,Sanders' surprise win and Clinton's defeat: What happened in Michigan?,[],"NBC News Kristen Welker, Kasie Hunt, Monica Alba, and Danny Freeman contributed reporting.

Theres no such thing as a sure bet in politics, but Michigan certainly seemed like one for Hillary Clinton. The Real Clear Politics average of recent polls had her up by more than 21 points on Election Day, and the data whizzes at FiveThirtyEight gave her a 99 percent chance of winning the race. (After Sanders won, they also called it one of the greatest upsets in modern political history.)

Even the Sanders campaign was bracing for defeat, and spent Tuesday pre-spinning a loss while the Clinton campaign gained little traction arguing the race was closer than expected.

RELATED: Michigan win rescues Bernie Sanders campaign

When exhausted Sanders staffers reached their hotel in Miami Tuesday night, they were stunned to find their candidate ahead in early returns and scrambled to assemble a podium so he could address the press. As Clinton gave a speech in Cleveland that did not mention Michigan, seemingly frustrated aides focused on Clintons large net delegate win in Mississippi, which held a primary on the same day.

So what happened? Both campaigns are still picking over the wreckage for clues, but heres what we know so far about how Sanders net an unexpected victory.

Sanders went all in, Clinton took her eye off the ball: Clinton seemed to take Michigan for granted after a string of big wins, leading her to begin turning to the general election. Team Sanders, meanwhile, saw Michigan as a must-win and invested accordingly. They outspent Clinton by about $500,000 on TV and spent almost three times as much on radio ads in the final week of the campaign as they had during any week in any state up to now.

Sanders brass deployed two veteran operatives  Robert Becker, who ran Sanders campaign in Iowa, and Julia Barnes, who ran his New Hampshire campaign  to help organize the state, and built a robust ground operation.

Clinton invested less heavily in her field program, which largely focused on African-Americans. Some supporters worried when they saw few Clinton yard signs, and some volunteers grumbled about disorganization and under-resourcing, but the realization of a major problem didnt come soon enough.

In closing days, the campaign scrambled to bring in reinforcements. They redirected Bill and Chelsea Clinton to spend more time in the state, and called on Michigan allies to rally troops. But it was too little, too late.

On a conference call with reporters Wednesday, Clintons campaign manager Robby Mook pushed back on that notion. Were proud of the ground game we ran, he said.

Geography: Clinton spent virtually all of her time in Detroit, along with a church visit in Flint last month and a small visit to a software company in Grand Rapids. Bill and Chelsea Clinton hit other parts of the state in the final push, but the candidate herself didnt hold any public rallies outside of Detroit during the entire campaign.

RELATED: Ghetto gaffe highlights Sanders campaigns struggle with race

While Clinton focused on population centers, Sanders allies said the candidate and his team did a better job of activating voters across the state. He won 73 of Michigans 83 counties (though Clinton won the most populous ones), and ran up large margins in counties that include Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor.

Despite making Flint the soul of her Michigan campaign, Clinton didnt hold a single open event in the city during her five days in the state leading up to Tuesday. She also did not attend the watch party her campaign organized after Sundays debate in Flint, as she has in other states, disappointing some attendees.

Inroads with African-American voters: African-Americans have been determinative of the Democratic primary so far, and may have been in Michigan, too. Clinton was once again banking on black voters, but Sanders performed better with that group in Michigan than he did in the South. He still lost black votes 68 to 38, but thats 20 points better than he did with that voting bloc in Mississippi. They also made up a slightly smaller proportion of the vote than expected.

Sanders core supporters turned out big: Young people, Sanders most important voting bloc, turned out in larger-than-expected numbers, with those younger than 30 making up the same portion of the electorate as those older than 65. Sanders visited every college town in the state, turning out huge crowds when he did, which the campaign says proves their point that they can move the needle anywhere they move their candidate.

And Sanders did better than usual among those slightly older, winning 53 percent of those between the ages of 30 and 44.

Michigans open primary allows independents to vote in either party, and Sanders always does well among among independents. He performed even better than expected with that group on Tuesday, winning 71 percent of independents casting ballots in the Democratic primary.

Some speculate that Clinton supporters were complacent and stayed home, or possibly even voted in the Republican primary in an attempt to stop Trump.

The weather: It was an unseasonably warm 70 degrees in much of the state on Election Day, helping to push up turnout in both partys primaries to record levels. More than 2.5 million voters participated in the Republican and Democratic primaries, shattering the record of 1.93 million set in the 1972 primary and the expected 2 million turnout.

Fertile ground for Sanders message: Late-deciders broke for Sanders and most pollsters had stopped contacting voters on Sunday. Michigan was a perfect place for Sanders message because of its Rust Belt history and relatively friendly demographics. His emphasis on unpopular free trade deals and his performance in Sunday nights debate, while panned by some analysts, could have changed minds.

The Sanders campaign also believes Clintons charge (which they called misleading and unfair) that he voted against the auto bailout backfired. The auto rescue was included in the Wall Street bailout bill, which Sanders voted against, and they believe hitting on him on the issue played into the idea that she is dishonest and reminded voters of Wall Street. Mook rejected that claim outright. Well continue to talk about it, he said.",[]

msnbc.com,,Trump: 'Not proud' of children mimicking my deportation rhetoric,[],"Donald Trump said Wednesday he is not proud that children are mimicking his rhetoric.

There have been incidents of children, of white children, pointing to their darker-skinned classmates and saying, Youll be deported when Donald Trump is president. There have been incidents of white kids at basketball games holding up signs to teams which have Hispanic kids on them, saying, Were going to build a wall to keep you out. Are you proud of that? Is that something youve done in American political and social discourse that youre proud of? NPR news analyst Cokie Roberts asked Trump on Morning Joe.

Roberts question was prompted by reports from around the country that the language Trump has used on the campaign trail is being repeated by youth.

A Virginia school district confirmed a story about a third grader being told by his classmates that he would be deported if Trump became president. The childs mother took to Facebook to voice her disgust, writing, I just got a call from my sons teacher... that two of his classmates... point(ed) out the immigrants in the class who would be sent home when Trump becomes President... They singled him out... because of the color of his skin... In third grade.... in Fairfax County... in 2016.

A high school basketball game in Indiana took a controversial turn after spectators allegedly chanted statements that were taken as racist toward Latinos. A report said that fans of one team had big placards with Donald Trumps face and were yelling, Build a wall, build a wall.

The business moguls name was also invoked during an Iowa basketball game to allegedly taunt a team that included boys from racial minorities. According to a report, fans of the opposing team chanted Trump! Trump! Trump! to rile the players.

Trump took issue with Roberts inquiry and insisted he did not have knowledge of these incidents. He also maintained that his rhetoric on deportation was directed toward illegal immigration.

I think your questions a very nasty question, Trump said. And Im not proud of it because I didnt even hear of it, OK? And I certainly do not like it at all when I hear about it. Youre the first one whose told me about that.

I talk about deporting people that are here illegally, Trump said of his immigration platform. We have a country or we dont.

But what about the children, Mr. Trump? Roberts asked. Trump defended his message, calling it very positive. The Republican front-runner went on to say that he thought the United States needed to be made great again.

I think America is right now very, very troubled. I think were being laughed at all over the world.

Referencing the military, Trump said that we cant beat ISIS and that veterans are being treated poorly. Trump also pointed to health care and debt after saying that the U.S. education system is at the bottom of the heap worldwide.

msnbc.com,,MO state senators end filibuster over 'religious freedom' bill,"['Associated Press', 'Erik Ortiz']","A 39-hour filibuster led by Democratic legislators in Missouri ended Wednesday morning when Republicans forced a vote on a controversial measure to add more religious protections to people opposed to same-sex marriage.

The bill, known as Senate Joint Resolution 39, passed 21-11 after the GOP senators broke the filibuster using a procedural move.

The talk-a-thon on the Missouri State Capitol floor in Jefferson City  perhaps the longest continuous filibuster in the states history  began 4 p.m. Monday. The Democrats took turns criticizing the hot-button bill.

It proposes to amend the Missouri Constitution and prohibit the state from penalizing clergy, religious organizations, and certain individuals for their religious beliefs concerning marriage between two people of the same sex.

The Republican-controlled state Senate must vote an additional time on the measure before the MIssouri House can take it up.

The senators efforts had been praised by Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon, a Democrat, who said they are standing on the right side of history.

Inspired by senators heroic stand against discrimination in #MO. The nation is watching & cheering you on! #SJR39 #NotInMyState  Governor Jay Nixon (@GovJayNixon) March 9, 2016

Though it doesnt list specific protected businesses, the measure comes after bakers and florists have faced legal challenges in other states for declining to provide services for same-sex weddings.

In less serious moments of the filibuster, the senators riffed on Tyler Perry movies, shoes, and Jews who eat pork, according to The New York Times. Star Wars trivia came up, too.

Business in the chamber was effectively halted, and highlighted the national debate over balancing civil rights and religious liberties following last years Supreme Court ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide.

Missouris session runs through mid-May. That leaves plenty of time for Resolution 39 to also move through the Republican-led House. It would then be submitted to statewide voters in either the August primary or November general election.

During the filibuster, Democrats proved to be relentless.

State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, of St. Louis, said she was taking dietary supplements for energy. State Senate President Pro Tem Ron Richard, a Republican, said Tuesday he has had not slept since the filibuster started  aside from a roughly 15-minute nap in the Senate chamber.

Democratic state Sen. Jason Holsman, of Kansas City, said he had not left the Capitol since Monday afternoon.

That means Im probably pretty rank at this point, Holsman said on the Senate floor.

The filibuster marked the longest continuous debate in recent Missouri history. Four state Senate Democrats  including current U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr.  led a 38-hour filibuster spread over five legislative days against an abortion bill in 1999. That bill ultimately passed the state Senate.

Missouris session also surpasses the longest filibuster in the U.S. Senate, when Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes to stall the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1957. He reportedly read from historical documents to pass the time.

More recently, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz in 2013 spent 21 hours and 18 minutes filibustering from the U.S. Senate floor to oppose Obamacare. He read bedtime stories for part of it.

msnbc.com,,Rubio says he's 'not entirely proud' of personal attacks against Trump,['Alexandra Jaffe'],"Marco Rubio said Wednesday hes not entirely proud of his personal attacks on Donald Trump and wouldnt have launched them if he could do things over again.

In terms of things that have to do with personal stuff, yeah, at the end of the day its not something Im entirely proud of. My kids were embarrassed by it, and if I had to do it again I wouldnt, he said during an MSNBC town hall.

view photo essay The presidential campaign: Marco Rubio Because of his youth and relatively moderate campaign rhetoric, Rubio is often touted as the Republican Partys best hope of appealing to younger voters.

Rubios sudden shift to aggressively attacking Trump one week before the Super Tuesday primary contests saw the candidate mock Trump on the debate stage and during nearly every one of his stump speeches following. The attacks took a personal turn, with Rubio making fun of Trumps tan, his hair and ultimately the size of his hands  a veiled jab at Trumps manhood  at a rally shortly before voters went to the polls that week.

The strategy won him wall-to-wall media coverage but did little to cement Rubio as the anointed alternative to Trump. Indeed, it appears to have hurt him, as he struggled to overcome Ted Cruz during the Super Tuesday contests and his support has since cratered, resulting in disappointing finishes in primaries across the nation over the past week. Some Republicans have criticized Rubio for damaging the image of the Republican Party, as major Republican donor Fred Malek put it on MSNBC this week.

Rubios comments Wednesday were an implicit acknowledgment that the strategy didnt work, and he has since shifted away from personal attacks on Trump in favor of more policy-focused fare. But he insisted that it was appropriate to point out that Trump is portraying himself as something hes not, a central focus of his argument against the GOP frontrunner.

RELATED: Marco Rubios campaign is on life support

Trump has been dismissive of Rubios attacks, telling reporters at a press conference Tuesday that hostility works for some people  it doesnt work for him. But on MSNBC Wednesday morning, he was asked about the possibility of a Rubio pick.

Sure, sure and hes got talent. I just dont want to say that yet, Trump said.

Rubio, however, insisted at the MSNBC town hall Rubio said he had no interest in playing second fiddle for Trump or any other GOP candidates.

Im not looking to be anyones vice president, Rubio said.

Pressed directly is he would tell Trump no if asked to being his running mate, Rubio responded, absolutely.

msnbc.com,,Democratic wins in Kentucky deny GOP total control,[],"Republican dominance over the South is quite extraordinary, but theres one entity in the region that Democrats have managed to hold onto: the Kentucky State House, which Dems have controlled since 1921. This week, Republicans hoped to change that.

When Kentuckys General Assembly convened in January, Democrats still controlled the chamber, 50 to 46, but there were four vacancies that needed to be filled. The states new, right-wing governor, Republican Matt Bevin, announced there would be special elections on March 8 to fill those four seats, and quite possibly erase the Democratic advantage.

I want conservative people, Bevin declared at the time, adding, I will do everything in my power to make sure that the people who I think embody the values that I was elected to represent are elected. I do think theyll be Republicans.

The governor thought wrong. The Lexington Herald-Leader reported overnight:

Democrats won three of four House seats up for grabs in Tuesdays special election, increasing their majority status in the House chamber by one for the rest of the 2016 General Assembly, including the all-important process of writing the next state budget. T he House will have 53 Democrats and 47 Republicans through the fall elections. It is the final state legislative chamber in the South to remain in Democratic control, and it is the last bastion of Democratic Party power in Kentucky, which otherwise has been trending Republican in state and federal elections.

Democratic candidates not only won the two seats that had been held by other Dem lawmakers, the party also flipped a seat that had been held by a Republican.

For Bevin, who campaigned aggressively in these special elections and helped the GOP candidates raise money, its a real setback. In fact, its arguably a rebuke  if the governor and his agenda enjoyed broad support, his party likely would have fared better yesterday.

But just as important is the fact that Bevin was counting on total Republican control of the state government to do what far-right governors have been able to do in states like Michigan, Kansas, and North Carolina: implement a radical agenda without regard for Democratic objections.

msnbc.com,,All-female 'Ghostbusters' already fending off controversy,[],"The highly anticipated all-female reboot of Ghostbusters has already become a source of controversy after just one trailer for the film has seen the light of day.

Leslie Jones is an actress, thats clear, right? You know she could act like a scientist like the white people, yes? #ghostbusters #ugh  Sofiya Alexandra (@TheSofiya) March 3, 2016

When the first teaser for the film debuted earlier this month there was widespread criticism of the fact that the lone African-American ghostbuster  played by Saturday Night Live star Leslie Jones  is a blue-collar worker for the New York City transit agency, while the other three, played by Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig and Kate McKinnon, were all scientists.

Jones struck back at critics of the choice on social media. Why cant a regular person be a ghostbuster. Im confused. And why cant i be the one who plays them i am a performer. Just go see the movie! she tweeted. Regular People save the world everyday so if Im the sterotype!! Then so be it!! We walk among Heroes and take them for granted.

RELATED: Dan Aykroyd delighted by all-female Ghostbusters

Later, she added: ITS NOT A MAN, WOMAN, RACE, CLASS THANG!! ITS A GHOSTBUSTER THANG!! AND AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED WE ALL GHOSTBUSTERS!! STAND TALL!! She also shared a supportive message from a real life NYC transit worker who applauded her representation in the upcoming film.

But when the backlash refused to died down, Jones  who has polarized audiences with some of her politically incorrect routines on SNL in the past  floated the idea of quitting Twitter entirely, which prompted a defense from the new Ghostbusters films director Paul Feig.

Dont leave us, @Lesdoggg. You are a goddess & one of the warmest funniest forces of nature I know. F**k the haters, he tweeted. And haters, attack me all you want but when you attack and insult my cast, youve crossed the line. Grow up and leave my cast alone.

While African-American comedian Cyrus McQueen considers Jones an amazing talent and was thrilled to see her become a part of such an iconic franchise, he told MSNBC on Wednesday that the trailer left him with a sinking feeling down in the pit of my stomach.

Although this is an ensemble, it seemed to me that a black actress was again boxed into the role of sassy sidekick, best friend, the tough talking blue collar worker, there only to provide some comedic sass, some edge, yet in no way challenge the flawed and pre-existing views of African-American women, he said.

And while McQueen concedes that the film is a comedy and an absurd one to boot, its still problematic how often black actors are relegated to certain types of roles in the genre.

Ill never forget, in my very first scene in my very first improv [comedy] class, my scene partner pimped me into being a man that was mugging him. And so, I feel when it comes to this new Ghostbusters, Leslie Jones was pimped into being the predictable yet palatable urban black sidekick. Again, I love her and I love that they gave her this opportunity. Im not hating the player, to again reference the world of improv, Im hating the game.

#NeverForget: In the #Ghostbusters book, Winston is a Marine and the original script had him holding mad PhDs pic.twitter.com/68T0liFcn5  Black Nerd Problems (@blknrdproblems) March 4, 2016

Veteran actor Ernie Hudson, who played Zeddemore in the 1984 original and its 1989 sequel, has been largely sanguine about his part in the series, which was originally a much larger one written for comedian Eddie Murphy. But when the film marked its 30th anniversary in 2014, he expressed more ambiguity about how his role was handled.

Instead of coming in at the very beginning of the movie, like page eight, the character came in on page 68 after the Ghostbusters were established. His elaborate background was all gone, replaced by me walking in and saying, If theres a steady paycheck in it, Ill believe anything you say, he told Entertainment Weekly at the time. The next morning, I rush to the set and plead my case. And [the director] basically says, The studio felt that they had Bill Murray, so they wanted to give him more stuff to do. I go, Okay, I understand that, but can I even be there when theyre established? And of course, he said no, theres nothing to do about it. It was kind of awkward, and it became sort of the elephant in the room.

All these years later, the new Ghostbusters is arriving in a cultural climate that is far more aware and sensitive to the marginalization of characters of color. Ever since this reboot was announced there has been grumbling within the fan base about the decision to recast the series with women, even though all of the original stars have given the new film their blessing. Audiences wont get a chance to judge the film for themselves until this summer, and some of Jones fans have embraced a wait-and-see approach for now.

Im not saying that she should constantly defend herself, but she can use the platform to promote her art, and have honest and open dialogue with people that follow her and some folks that have issues with her role, BET associate editor Taj Rani told MSNBC on Wednesday. As an industry veteran she knows that folks wont like or love everything that she does, but she is important to the representation of black women in comedy and thats something that shouldnt go over anyones head. And because of that we want her voice and talent onscreen, behind the scenes and on social media.

Meanwhile, the international version of the trailer for the film includes a direct reference to the race issue. When Jones character attempts to crowd surf in one scene and the audience allows her to crash land on the floor, she quips: I dont know if it was a race thing or a lady thing, but Im mad as hell.",[]

msnbc.com,,Kasich goes after Clinton on Libya war,[],"A discussion during Thursdays Republican presidential debate about the growth of ISIS inside the country of Libya prompted a sharp remark from Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who told a Michigan debate hall that Hillary Clinton was to blame.

Hillary Clinton worked aggressively to depose Muammar Gaddafi, Kasich said during the Fox News Republican debate in Detroit, referring to Clintons time as secretary of state under President Obama.

They pushed him out, Kasich said of the Libyan leader. Now we have a fertile ground for ISIS.

Although Kasich is trailing in polls, his attack could have lasting power beyond his own candidacy. Should Clinton become the Democratic nominee, she will likely face questions about how to address the ISIS presence inside a country she helped to shake up. Libya is Clintons personal problem in a way that Iraq and Syria  where the American air campaign is currently focused  are not.

RELATED: Only the voters can judge Donald Trumps horror show of a debate

Asked by moderators how he would address the problem, Kasich said that American troops may have to intervene inside Libya to take on ISIS there, a position that put him in agreement with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Whatever one thinks of American troops in Libya as a matter of policy, Kasichs history lesson is not without merit.

A civil war in Libya flared at the outset of the so-called Arab Spring, leaving the White House to ponder intervening in order to protect the Libyan people. Clinton, along with then-U.N. ambassador Susan Rice and White House adviser Samantha Power, pushed for military action. A NATO-led air campaign began in the spring of 2011. In October of that year, Gaddafi was hunted down and killed by a rebel mob.

Since Gaddafis death, Libya has spiraled into further disarray. The country is now run by two rival governments and vast stretches of desert south of the coastline are home to terrorist organizations, including affiliates of ISIS.

Democrats appeared to have also realized this could be a problem for Clinton.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has brought up the war in Libya during debates, as well, accusing Clinton of being too into regime change.

Maryland Gov. Martin OMalley was even tougher on Clinton before he dropped out of the race last month. I know Sec. Clinton was gleeful when Gaddafi was torn apart, the former Democratic presidential candidate said during a debate in December.

Clinton has called the Libya war an exercise in smart power, noting that European allies had pleaded with the U.S. to intervene on behalf of the Libyan people. We did not put one single American soldier on the ground in Libya, Clinton said during a debate in October.

But now there are new questions about whether American soldiers are needed there  and not to free a population this time, but to battle a terrorist army.",[]

Brandi Chastain, who became Americas soccer-playing hero when she when she scored the game-winning goal for the U.S. against China in the 1999 World Cup final, is donating her brain to science, officials at Boston University confirmed Thursday.

Chastains gray matter is going to BU researchers studying chronic traumatic encephalopathy or CTE, a degenerative brain disease that has been found in athletes who suffered concussions during their careers.

Im not going to be needing it at the end of my life, Chastain told USA TODAY Sports.

Chastain, who is 47 and retired from the sport that made her famous, said she hopes scientists can learn something from studying the brain of a woman athlete like her.

Could we then use that information to help say that before the age of 14, its not a good idea to head the ball? she told the paper.

Chastain said she suffered two concussions while playing college soccer and sometimes saw stars but has not exhibited any CTE symptoms.

I never had an official diagnosis of a concussion in my career, she said. But as you grow older, you sometimes say, gosh, am I losing my memory or did I used to forget when I went into a room what I went in there for? Could this be the start of something?

Dr. Ann McKee, who heads the CTE Center at BU, applauded Chastain.

Brandi Chastains decision to donate her brain to further research is a powerful and courageous act that will ultimately improve the future health of female athletes, military veterans and other women who experience repetitive brain trauma, McKee said in a statement. We currently know so little about how gender influences outcome after trauma; her pledge marks an important step to expand our knowledge in this critical area.

Just seven of the 307 brains that BU researchers have examined were from women and none were diagnosed with CTE, BU medical school spokeswomanGina DiGravio-Wilczewski said.

Chastain landed on the covers of Sports Illustrated, TIME and Newsweek after scoring her game-winning goal when she tore off her jersey in celebration.

Paul McCartney described Martin as like a second father to me.

In a statement, he added: If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle it was George. From the day that he gave The Beatles our first recording contract, to the last time I saw him, he was the most generous, intelligent and musical person Ive ever had the pleasure to know ... The world has lost a truly great man who left an indelible mark on my soul and the history of British music.

Thank you for all your love and kindness George peace and love xx pic.twitter.com/um2hRFB7qF  #RingoStarr (@ringostarrmusic) March 9, 2016

Martin was an EMI staff producer who had the foresight and the ear to sign a band that had been turned down by virtually every other major label in London in 1962, before Starr was a full-fledged member. Martin signed the group from Liverpool to the Parlophone imprint he oversaw before meeting the members on the strength of demo tapes shopped by manager Brian Epstein. He often said in interviews that he was initially impressed as much by their wit and natural charm as he was by their musical abilities.

In a story that has become Beatles legend, as Martin showed the group around the EMI recording studio at their first extended recording session, he asked if there was anything they didnt like about the configuration of the studio. Guitarist George Harrison quickly responded: For starters, I dont like your tie.

Martin proved to be a huge influence on the groups sound  he famously suggested they speed up the tempo of Please, Please Me, turning a Roy Orbison-esque ballad into a rocker that marked the Beatles first No. 1 record in Britain. Perhaps most significantly, he expressed his faith in McCartney and John Lennon as songwriters by conceding to their demand to record their own material and rebuffing his suggestion that the pop tune How Do You Do It be their first single.

Through the bands ups and downs in the late 1960s, Martin remained a constant for the Beatles, a figure who commanded respect from Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Harrison no matter how fierce the in-fighting was among the foursome.

Martins skill as a producer and arranger allowed the band to flourish as they evolved from recording the material theyd worked out on stage for years in clubs to the more intricate recordings found on the 1965 album Rubber Soul and 1966s Revolver. He helped them arrange strings for Yesterday and work with more exotic instruments such as the Indian sitar that Harrison began experimenting with on such songs as Norwegian Wood.

The bands major collaboration with a producer other than Martin came on tracks that comprised the 1970 album Let It Be, which by many accounts was a frustrating experience as producer Phil Spector applied his Wall of Sound formula to songs such as the title song and The Long and Winding Road. After Let It Be, the group enlisted Martin for producing duties on Abbey Road, which was released prior to Let It Be but was recorded afterward.

Martin worked with a range of other artists during and after the Beatles era, from Cilla Black to Tom Jones to America to solo works by Paul McCartney and by Wings. But it was his success with the Beatles that made Martin one of the most famous record producers of all time. He earned Britains prestigious CBE honor in 1988.

Born in 1926, Martin became interested in music at a young age. During World War II, he worked as a surveyor and clerk for the War Office and joined the Royal Navy working as a pilot in its Fleet Air unit. He left the service in 1947 and enrolled in Guildhall School of Music, where he studied piano.

He began working for the BBCs classical music department after graduation but by 1950 had joined EMI. He worked as an assistant to the head of the low-profile Parlophone imprint, which was known for novelty and comedy records including a recording of the famed Beyond the Fringe comedy outfit featuring Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett.

By 1955, Martin had taken over as head of Parlophone. His experience with cutting-edge British comedy talent resonated would later help him bond with the Beatles. Martin by his own account was intrigued by the surge of pop and R&B acts in Britain in the early 1960s. He was in the market for a group to work with when Epstein called on him with tapes that had been recorded  and rejected  by Decca Records. Martin set a handshake deal with Epstein in May 1962 but didnt finalize the contract until he met the band the following month.

At the same time, Sen. Marco Rubio, the candidate many in the establishment pegged as their champion, appears to be on life support. His rapid decline leaves Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a hardline conservative loathed by many party insiders, as the GOPS last best alternative to Trump.

RELATED: Theres just one week left to stop Donald Trump

Trump easily won Michigan and Mississippi, the two biggest delegate prizes of the night. In doing so he once again dashed rivals hopes that their frantic efforts to drag down his campaign might finally be yielding fruit. Cruz won in Idaho while Hawaii, the last state to come in, was still voting as of midnight. ET.

I dont think Ive ever had so many horrible things said about me, Trump stated in a press conference on Tuesday night.

The two races were a heat check ahead of crucial winner-take-all races in Ohio and Florida. The results suggest that Trump is well positioned to compete in both states. If they go his way, his rivals will have few paths to defeating him short of a long shot effort to narrowly deny him a delegate majority and then somehow oust him in a contested convention in July.

view photo essay Standing up against Donald Trump At Trump rallies, people of all ages and creeds, even some outside the continent, have continued to make their voices heard.

Making Trumps path to Florida easier: The ongoing collapse of Rubio, who suffered through a brutal night on Tuesday ahead of his home state primary.

In Michigan, a state Rubios campaign would likely have considered prime territory just weeks ago, he failed to crack double digits. The results were even worse in Mississippi, where he finished in fourth with just 5 percent with 92 percent of precincts reporting.

It was a major shift from Super Tuesday just one week earlier, when Rubio closely battled Senator Ted Cruz for second place in similar southern states. This time Rubio finished well behind third-place Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has shown little appeal in the region.

Rubios implosion could not come at a worse time, both for his own campaign and for the broader anti-Trump effort led by former Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

Romney, who recorded robo-calls for Rubio and Kasich in Michigan, urged Republicans in a speech last week to vote for the senator in Florida and Kasich in Ohio in order to deny Trump a delegate majority. Now Rubio looks like a zombie candidate as the race turns to his own state, where many voters have already cast early ballots.

RELATED: Anti-Trump forces have very few options for third party alternative

After largely avoiding clashes with Trump for months, Rubio turned his campaign into a vehicle for an all-out war on the front-runner over the last several weeks. In speeches and debates, he derided Trump as a con artist and unelectable, accused him of ripping off students with his Trump University program, and mocked his hair, his tan, and the size of his anatomy.

The results, combined with weak performances in four states on Saturday, suggested that his kitchen sink strategy against Trump backfired big time. Heading into Tuesday night, Rubio had won just two contests: Minnesota and Puerto Rico.

Even before the latest races, Rubio had already started to acknowledge that he was unlikely to win the nomination without forcing a contested convention.

Assuming he stays in the race through Florida, Rubio will have significant help from outside the campaign for his last stand. Republican donors have poured over $8.3 million into a variety of super PACs that are carpet bombing Trump with attack ads in Florida, per NBC News  far more than Trumps $1.7 million in ad spending.

For Cruz, Rubios staggered position presents an opportunity to knock his rival out of the race quickly, and then hope he can sideline Kasich to force a one-on-one contest against Trump. Cruz is campaigning in Miami on Wednesday and a super PAC supporting him has announced it will run several different attack ads against Rubio this week.

There is some polling evidence, including a new NBC/WSJ survey of GOP voters released on Tuesday, that Trump is vulnerable if the race shrinks to two people. Anti-Trump Republicans dont have time to slowly wear him down, though. They need him to fall apart  and fast  to have any hopes of stopping him.

As it stands, even their most optimistic scenarios at this point assume a brutal July convention that would likely shatter party unity just as the general election begins. Whether or not they manage to defeat Trump at this point, the damage Trumps campaign has already done to the GOPs present incarnation is catastrophic. Whatever party crawls out of the smoking wreckage of the primary will not be the same one that entered it.",[]

msnbc.com,,What if Mario Cuomo had run for president?,[],"Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, who died on New Years Day at age 82, leaves behind a formidable political legacy  and a mystery for the ages: What if hed gotten on that plane?

It was Dec. 20, 1991, a Friday, and the filing deadline for New Hampshires first-in-the-nation presidential primary was at 5 p.m. All eyes, though, were on Albany, New York where 10 weeks of torturous and highly public vacillation were for Gov. Cuomo finally coming to a head. In the statehouse, he and his team sought a last-minute resolution to a budget impasse that  the governor had suggested more than once  represented the only significant obstacle between him and a presidential candidacy. A few miles away, a private plane sat idling at Albanys airport, ready to whisk Cuomo to the Granite State on a moments notice.

RELATED: Liberal lion Mario Cuomo dies at age 82

It was a drama that had kicked off in early October, when seemingly out of nowhere Cuomo had told a closed-door meeting of his donors at the Regency Hotel in Manhattan that he would think about running for president in 1992. With that one gesture, he effectively froze in place the Democratic field  and all of American politics  for the rest of the fall.

Sure, there were already six Democrats seeking the partys nomination to oppose George H.W. Bush, including Bill Clinton, who we know today as one of American historys most talented political salesmen. But Clinton was a dwarf in 1991, a little-known governor from a backwater state who most people figured was running for president for the exposure. To that point, the story of the presidential race hadnt been who was running; it was who had taken a pass: Bill Bradley, Al Gore, Richard Gephardt, Lloyd Bentsen, Jay Rockefeller  basically, every A-lister on the Democratic side.

Bush was supposed to be invulnerable. In early 91, hed orchestrated the Gulf War, evicting Saddam Hussein from Kuwait and, it was said, helping the country kick its Vietnam syndrome once and for all. Massive parades and homecoming celebrations ensued, pushing Bushs approval rating over 90% and leaving Democrats to pick from scraps. At that point, it was an open question whether the Democratic Party could ever win a national election again. Republicans had won at least 40 states in the past three White House races, and except for Jimmy Carters squeaker in 1976 (which had come to look more and more like a fluke), the GOP was undefeated since 1968. The Democrats, many concluded, were now simply a congressional party.

RELATED: Politicians react to Mario Cuomos death

But the economy was in trouble and Bushs numbers were starting to erode. 92 might not necessarily be a lost cause, Democrats began to say  if only we had a real candidate. Thats what made Cuomos October admission such a major event. The Mario Cuomo of 1991 wasnt just a big-name Democrat  he was the big-name Democrat, a folk hero to the partys beleaguered liberal base ever since his mesmerizing 1984 convention speech, a living, breathing reminder of the politically potent connection with ethnic Catholics that had powered the party in the days of FDR and LBJ  and that had frayed badly in the age of Reagan. To Democrats, the promise of Mario Cuomo was the promise of restoration. It was also the promise of victory. If they were going to break the GOPs Electoral College lock in 92, a Clinton or a Paul Tsongas or a Jerry Brown or a Bob Kerrey wouldnt do it. They needed the stature of a Mario Cuomo.

He didnt make it easy on them. For the rest of October, through all of November, and right up until that fateful Friday before Christmas, Cuomo issued a steady stream of utterly contradictory hints and head fakes. One day, it would sound like he was in. What does my heart tell me? he asked in late October. Go out and tell them, Mario  take your best shot, whether you win, lose or draw. But then nothing would happen. He talked of reaching a decision by the November election, and then by Thanksgiving, but those dates came and went. One of the partys top strategic minds, James Carville, pronounced himself ready to help run a Cuomo campaign  then, after hearing not a peep from Albany, signed on with Clinton. Party leaders grew restless, and his would-be rivals, starved of media oxygen, became contemptuous.

As the New Hampshire deadline neared, Clinton said: I always thought hed run, and I always thought hed wait until the last minute. He waited long enough to see which way the wind was blowing.

Thats when it started to look like Cuomo was actually going to do it. The Monday of that deadline week, his team dispatched an emissary to the New Hampshire Statehouse to retrieve the necessary paperwork. The next day, New Yorks top Republican, Sen. Alfonse DAmato, paid a trip to Albany to ridicule Cuomos inability to reach a budget deal  and to preview what Republicans would say if he went ahead and ran.

The more I hear their attack, Cuomo said, the more enticing it becomes.

By Thursday, there were stories about fundraising calls, out-of-state endorsements and rented office space in New Hampshire. On the day of the deadline, the New York Post quoted a top Cuomo aide saying, It looks and smells like a go. The Washington Post reported that signs pointed to the governor becoming a candidate. There was only one cable news channel back then, and throughout the day that Friday, CNN kept returning to a live shot of the idling plane. Any minute, Cuomo might board it, jet off to New Hampshire, and write his own chapter of history.

But it never moved, and by mid-afternoon it was clear that it wasnt going to. When he faced the press, Cuomo stuck to his script about the budget. If thered been a deal, he said, I would travel to New Hampshire today and file my name as a candidate. But that was  and still is  a hard one to swallow. With all of his pride and conviction, Cuomo never seemed like the kind of guy whod farm out a decision like that to a bunch of opposition party state legislators.

Not that a truly satisfactory explanation has emerged these past 23 years. It remains one of those great conversation-starting what ifs? What if Cuomo had run? Would he have dominated the Democratic field and dethroned a weakened Bush? Or maybe that chronic indecision would have translated into a dysfunctional candidacy that would have wilted under a level of scrutiny Cuomo had never before faced? (My own guess is that Cuomo would have won the nomination, if only because his presence would have dramatically altered how Democrats would have interpreted the subsequent Gennifer Flowers/Bill Clinton scandal  a scandal in which Cuomos name played a role. But thats another column for another day.)

The theory I ultimately gravitate toward is that Mario Cuomo was attracted to the nobility of a lost cause. In 1977, he ran for mayor stoically voicing opposition to capital punishment even as the Son of Sam terrorized New York City. In 1984 at the Democratic convention, his keynote address served as a valentine to the New Deal in liberalisms darkest hour. This is a man who could have looked at all those Democrats running away from George H.W. Bush and his 90% approval rating and decided that maybe this was a race that needed him. And this is a man who, upon realizing that he might actually win, could just as easily have decided he didnt want the trouble.",[]

view photo essay Standing up against Donald Trump At Trump rallies, people of all ages and creeds, even some outside the continent, have continued to make their voices heard.

Khalaf Al Habtoor, who has featured on the Forbes rich list, said Wednesday he was afraid a segment of the American public was falling under the sway of inappropriate candidates with extreme positions and vulgar turns of phrase.

I have always naively believed that presidential candidates were thoroughly screened in terms of background, family ties, colleagues and friends. It appears they are not, the billionaire wrote in An Open Letter to Our American Friends that is due to appear in Middle Eastern newspapers later this week.

Al Habtoor added that he was a great admirer of the U.S.

He wrote: All I can do is appeal to you, the voters, to sit quietly, take a deep breath and ponder on all the pros and cons of each candidate. Do not get caught up in hysteria or in the cult of personality. Your country is worth more. Forget such labels as Democrat and Republican.

Al Habtoor is the chairman of United Arab Emirates-based conglomerate Al Habtoor Group, which built Dubais airport and owns Aston Martin and Bentley dealerships and luxury hotels throughout the region.

He did not refer to Trump by name in the letter obtained by NBC News on Wednesday. But on Dec. 8, Al Habtoor told NBC News that he regretted supporting Trump, whom he had previously endorsed, after the real-estate mogul called for a total and complete shutdown on Muslims entering the U.S.

GOP debates are devolved into entertaining slanging matches with rivals launching personal attacks on one another to grab the media spotlight, he said, claiming that none of the Republican candidates had the dignity or gravitas to be commander-in-chief.

This is not a game or a television series. You, the good people of America, hold not only your future but the future of the world in your hands, Al Habtoor said.

He went on to support Hillary Clinton for president, saying the onetime first lady had a tried and true record despite missteps involving a private network server she used while secretary of state.

msnbc.com,,Donald Trump reveals details of his health care plan,[],"Donald Trump released his health care plan Wednesday evening, finally detailing the way in which he would fulfill his campaign trail promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.

In as seven-point plan posted to his website and publicized by a tweet, Trump says he will do away with the individual health insurance mandate, as well as allow competition over states lines for health care plans, and block grant Medicaid to the states, allowing them to follow through on his prescription to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse to preserve our precious resources.

I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare! Read more about my positions on healthcare reform here: https://t.co/WwIVhIud06  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 2, 2016

The decision to go against the idea of an individual mandate is new for Trump, who told CNN during a February town hall before the South Carolina primary that he likes the mandate and that makes him a little bit different than other conservatives.

But Wednesdays plan outlines as the first point on the list: Our elected representatives must eliminate the individual mandate. No person should be required to buy insurance unless he or she wants to.

He counters that, however, by saying individuals should be allowed to fully deduct health insurance premium payments from their tax returns.

The third bullet point goes on to say that we must make sure no one slips through the cracks simply because they cannot afford insurance and that we must review basic options for Medicaid and work with states to ensure that those who want healthcare coverage can have it.

Further, Trump ties illegal immigration to his healthcare plan, writing providing healthcare to illegal immigrants costs us some $11 billion annually ... If we were to simply enforce the current immigration laws and restrict the unbridled granting of visas to this country, we could relieve healthcare cost pressures on state and local governments.

Trump, who after almost every mass shooting has responded to questions on gun control with an answer about mental health, also noted the need for mental health institution reform. His plan states that [f]amilies, without the ability to get the information needed to help those who are ailing, are too often not given the tool to help their loved ones. Beyond this statement, however, Trump gives no solution. Instead, writing that there are promising reforms being developed in Congress that should receive bi-partisan support.

Another recent talking point that has made its way into the healthcare plan is pharmaceutical drugs, special interest control of prices, and the need to be able to negotiate. Though this talking point seemed to stem from former Bush finance chairman Woody Johnsons attendance to a GOP debate, Trump has since included the need to negotiate prices and unleash Washington from its special interest hold.

msnbc.com,,Michigan win rescues Bernie Sanders' campaign,[],"CLEVELAND  Bernie Sanders scored a critical upset in Michigans Democratic primary Tuesday, winning a narrow victory over front-runner Hillary Clinton in a state where polls had showed him far behind, and proving once again to be a competitor when most had counted him out.

The Vermont senator is still miles from catching up to Clinton, who won a commanding victory in Mississippis primary Tuesday night and holds a significant delegate lead. Sanders headed into Tuesdays contests about 200 delegates behind Clinton, not including so-called superdelegates, and desperately needed a win to remain a legitimate contender in the race.

The Michigan victory, Sanders first in a big and relatively diverse state, buys his campaign a lifeline and puts him back on a path that could at least conceivably end in him accepting the Democratic presidential nomination in July. And it underscores still lingering weaknesses with Clintons candidacy.

Just as Clinton and her allies began moving to ease Sanders aside and prepare for the general election, the results in Michigan suddenly make next Tuesdays contests here in Ohio, and in Missouri and Illinois, seem more competitive. view photo essay The presidential campaign: Bernie Sanders The self-described democratic socialist is known for pushing change on income inequality, college affordability and criminal justice reform.

This was a fantastic night, Sanders said at a late night press conference in Miami, which his campaign scrambled to assemble hours after he had given his formal remarks for the night. Our strongest areas are yet to happen.

It also adds new urgency and relevance to the next Democratic debate, scheduled for Wednesday night in Miami.

His advisers had long predicted the beginning of March would be rough for them, thanks to the high concentration of southern states with large African-American populations that so far have favored Clinton by wide margins. But with those states now in the rear view mirror, Sanders campaign expects to sail into friendlier waters later in the month, beginning next Tuesday. The campaign has even begun to eye North Carolina, which also votes that day, but will likely lag in Florida, a delegate treasure trove where Clinton is heavily favored.

Clintons campaign tried to appear unrattled by Tuesdays outcome, saying the delegate count would ultimately still favor them. Because delegates are awarded proportionally in the Democratic nominating process, her 67 point margin in Mississippi means she will likely rack up a larger net gain Tuesday, even after losing Michigan. Sanders never meaningfully competed in Mississippi.

We feel confident she is going to be the nominee, but the race will continue to be competitive through the next week, Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri told reporters at a Clinton rally in Cleveland Tuesday night. We would like to wrap it up as soon as possible because you dont want the Republican nominee to get, if they wrap up soon, we dont want to be far behind them.

Operatives with both campaigns, the press, and virtually the entire world headed into Tuesday night seemingly convinced that a win for Sanders was out of reach in Michigan  and thus probably for his entire campaign. The Real Clear Politics average of recent polls gave Clinton a 21.4 point lead going into primary day.

After Sundays debate in Flint, reporters covering the Sanders campaign questioned how much longer they would be assigned to it after the Vermont senator turned in a debate performance that, while feisty, included some real flubs like defending his vote against the TARP bailout plan in 2009 that included hundreds of millions of dollars of relief for Michigans troubled auto industry.

But the voters of Michigan had other ideas, and the night stretched on with polls too close to call long after both Sanders and Clinton had spoken and their supporters went home.

If Michigan is in play, Ohio is in play, said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal group that has not endorsed either Sanders or Clinton. Both candidates have an incentive to continue engaging in a race to the top on Elizabeth Warren-style economic populism issues.



Sanders was boosted in Michigan by young people and independent voters in the states open primary. And he did much better among African-Americans in Michigan than he did southern states, as his operatives had long expected, though he still fell behind Clinton.

Bernie closed a big gap, and he closed it fast, said Joe Dinkin, a spokesman for the Working Families Party, a progressive group that endorsed Sanders and boosted his grassroots effort. Tonight, the Sanders campaign proved once again that you shouldnt count them out  because the political revolution is spreading fast.",[]

Both Clinton and Sanders have called on Snyder to resign, and some here privately say they hope for a worse fate than even prison for the governor.

Snyder responded to the criticism by saying he will be here long after Clinton and Sanders head out of town. In a few days, political candidates will be leaving Flint and Michigan, he said on Twitter. They will not be staying to help solve the crisis, but I am committed to the people of Flint.

The candidates insisted otherwise. I will be with Flint all the way through this crisis, Clinton pledged during the debate.

At the Sanders field office in downtown Flint, theres a pile of water bottles in the corner and a sign out front that marks the location as a distribution point. When they set it up in early February, so many people came in asking for water that the campaign started giving it away, a supporter explained, as does Clintons Flint field office about 2.5 miles away.

Inside, and around town, some said their view on politics turned more radical after the water crisis. This is Flint, Michigan. Weve always been kind of the forgotten city, said John Gagnon, a die-hard Sanders volunteer. Hes been working at Sanders field office every day since it opened, even while hes finishing college and working as a engineer for a General Motors supplier.

Overall, Michigan voters were full of surprises in its presidential primary Tuesday night, handing an upset victory to Bernie Sanders and launching Donald Trump to win three states throughout the night. The pair of wins keep alive a presidential contest already chock-full of unpredictable turns, keeping Sanders in the race while many had already counted him out, and setting up Trump perilously close to running away with the Republican nomination.

The most fascinating results came out of Dearborn, where about 41 percent of voters are Arab-American. Sanders claimed an uncontested lead there with 59 percent of the vote to Hillary Clintons 39 percent.

Sanders had focused much of his campaigning efforts in Dearborn, holding events there twice over the last month to blast Clinton for her role in Libyas regime change and her record on trade. Over that time he released a radio ad in Arabic that also condemned his Republican opponents and cast himself as a voice of inclusion. And in his final swing through Michigan on Monday night, Sanders told the crowd that he had met with Arab-American leaders and vowed that Trump and his supporters were not going prevail in scapegoating minority communities.

We are going to end bigotry in this country once and for all, Sanders said during the rally.

Even more surprising were Trumps results on the Republican side. There he came ahead of runner-up John Kasich by roughly 10 points, with 39 percent to the Ohio governors 29 percent.

The candidate split comes amid a heightened climate of Islamophobia as the Arab-American community has been forced to shoulder much of the publics anxiety toward terror groups abroad and fear of more attacks. Muslim leaders have reported a number of potential hate crimes and attacks against the community throughout the U.S.

And yet, in a state with a deep history of acceptance toward the Arab community, Michigan Republicans reflected the feelings shared by an astounding majority of GOP voters  they support Trumps plan to temporarily ban Muslims, who are not U.S. citizens, from entering the country.

According to exit polls, 63 percent of Republican voters supported the proposal, 46 percent of which were Trump supporters, compared to 32 percent who said they were opposed.",[]

view photo essay The presidential campaign: Marco Rubio Because of his youth and relatively moderate campaign rhetoric, Rubio is often touted as the Republican Partys best hope of appealing to younger voters.

Rubios sudden shift to aggressively attacking Trump one week before the Super Tuesday primary contests saw the candidate mock Trump on the debate stage and during nearly every one of his stump speeches following. The attacks took a personal turn, with Rubio making fun of Trumps tan, his hair and ultimately the size of his hands  a veiled jab at Trumps manhood  at a rally shortly before voters went to the polls that week.

The strategy won him wall-to-wall media coverage but did little to cement Rubio as the anointed alternative to Trump. Indeed, it appears to have hurt him, as he struggled to overcome Ted Cruz during the Super Tuesday contests and his support has since cratered, resulting in disappointing finishes in primaries across the nation over the past week. Some Republicans have criticized Rubio for damaging the image of the Republican Party, as major Republican donor Fred Malek put it on MSNBC this week.

Rubios comments Wednesday were an implicit acknowledgment that the strategy didnt work, and he has since shifted away from personal attacks on Trump in favor of more policy-focused fare. But he insisted that it was appropriate to point out that Trump is portraying himself as something hes not, a central focus of his argument against the GOP frontrunner.

msnbc.com,,Another Christie childhood friend witnessed traffic surge,[],"On Sunday, the Port Authoritys executive director Pat Foye issued an investigation into the new report that a Port Authority police officer, with personal ties to New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, was at the George Washington Bridge when access lanes were closed last September. A new paper trail indicates the officer drove David Wildstein, the Christie appointee who supervised the closings, on a tour of the area as traffic brought it to a standstill.

Foye requested the agencys inspector general investigate the reported actions of police officers who were at the bridge during the lane closures, according to a source close to the Police Department.

Documents submitted to a New Jersey legislative committee by Wildstein also show that the officer, Lieutenant Thomas Chip Michaels, appears to have sent periodic text messages to Wildstein updating him on the effects of the lane closures and their crippling impact on the town of Fort Lee. In one message, on the first day of the lane closures, Michaels told Wildstein he might have an idea to make this better. It is not clear what he meant.

Close video Longtime Christie friend at lane closures Steve Kornacki breaks down the relationship between a Port Authority police officer, his longtime friendship with Gov. Chris Christie and his connection to the Fort Lee lane closure scandal. embed like save share group

Michaels, who joined the Port Authority Police Department in 1998 according to payroll records, grew up in Christie and Wildsteins hometown of Livingston, N.J. In recent years, he coached Christies son at little league hockey. Michaels brother, Jeffrey Michaels is among the most powerful Republicans in New Jersey politics  a lobbyist whose practice has soared in value during the Christie years and who has donated heavily to pro-Christie organizations.

Michaels presence at the lane closures with Wildstein is an important new detail because it places another person with long-time ties to the governor, this time in the Port Authority Police Department, at the scene witnessing the traffic surge that has since come to engulf Chrsties administration in legal inquires.

The revelation is also important because Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich had earlier questioned the Port Authority Police Departments actions during the closures. In a September 12 letter, Sokolich wrote to Port Authority deputy executive director Bill Baroni, a Christie appointee who has since resigned, that residents had told him that Port Authority Police Officers are advising commuters in response to their complaints that this recent traffic debacle is the result of a decision that I, as the Mayor, recently made. There is no evidence that Michaels was one of these officers.

In a statement released Monday, the Christie administration said the governor has never had any conversations with either Jeff or Chip Michaels on this topic. Christie emphatically denies taking part in or having any knowledge of the decision to close the lanes leading onto one of the busiest bridge in the world. He has said he doesnt know why members of his inner circle would have ordered the lanes closed.

After e-mails surfaced last month revealing his top aides discussed and apparently took part in the lane closures, Christie fired his deputy chief of staff Bridget Kelly and cut ties with Bill Stepien, one of his top political lieutenants. Wildstein, who served as director of interstate capital projects, resigned from the Port Authority in December. In a recent letter to the Authority, Wildsteins lawyer asserted that evidence exists showing that Christie knew of the lane closures while they were happening.

The governors office, Christies reelection campaign, and multiple top aides have been subpoenaed by the state legislative committee investigating the lane closures. A separate inquiry is underway at the U.S. Attorneys office, which is looking into the lane closures and also into allegations made by the mayor of Hoboken, N.J., that Christie officials threatened to withhold Sandy relief money from her city unless she moved forward with a redevelopment project represented by the law firm of one of Christies top political allies, Port Authority Chairman David Samson. The Governors office has denied any linkage between the project and Sandy money.

In 2010, a Newark Star-Ledger article described the Christie-Michaels family friendship as one that has endured for decades.

We break his chops a little bit, just saying, Youre the Governor?, looking at him laughing, Chip Michaels told the paper. Its crazy. He grew up like everyone else in New Jersey. So to see him as a celebrity, its just really odd. But hes the same guy. Hes a grounded guy. At the time the article was published, Michaels was coaching one of Christies sons in a youth hockey league. The article described a friendship dating back to their childhoods.

Multiple attempts to reach Chip Michaels directly and through the Port Authority were unsuccessful. The Port Authority Police Department has not returned calls for comment. Messages and emails sent to Jeffrey Michaels were not responded to.

Chip Michaels presence at the bridge at the time of the lane closures came to light during a review of documents that were subpoenaed by the New Jersey State Assemblys Transportation Committee late last year and released publicly in early January.

It was previously known that Wildstein and Robert Durando, the general manager of the George Washington Bridge, were present when the lane closures went into effect at 6:00 A.M. on September 9. In testimony before the Transportation Committee last December, Durando said that Wildstein had also met up with a Port Authority police lieutenant to tour the area.

He [Wildstein] came to the facility on Monday morning, Durando testified. He stood at the communications desk for a little while  its an area with cameras to look out at the various roadways  limited view, albeit. He stayed there for a little while. He then left the facility, left the communications desk with a police lieutenant assigned to the George Washington Bridge, to ride around the facility for some period of time to see the impact on traffic.

Among Wildsteins subpoenaed documents from that morning is a text message exchange with someone offering to pick him up in the parking lot at the Port Authority offices at the bridge. Wildstein replied: Im with Bob which presumably refers to Robert Durando. In the exchange, Wildstein told the person  whose identity was redacted by Wildsteins lawyer  that he would be ready around 7:30.

In an email sent at 7:28am, which was also was included in subpoenaed materials, Wildstein informed Durando that he was leaving to take a ride with Chip, seemingly indicating that Chip Michaels was the person Wildstein had been texting with earlier.

The night before the closures went into effect, documents show that Chip Michaels emailed his superior, Captain Darcy Licorish, to ask if a new traffic pattern was going into effect the following morning. From the redactions in the documents Wildstein shared, it appears he and Michaels had previously been exchanging text messages on a possibly unrelated matter.

On the first morning of the lane closures, text messages appear to show Michaels telling Wildstein before they went for their ride-around, that its [expletive] up here.

Fort Lee Police Chief Keith Bendul told msnbc that Michaels was one of three Port Authority Police officials he reached out to on the morning of the lane closures as he unsuccessfully tried to contain the impact on the area.

Michaels brother Jeffrey Michaels served as the chief of staff to Republican Gov. Donald DiFrancesco just over a decade ago before transitioning into lobbying. When Christie ran for governor in 2009, Jeffrey Michaels served as a campaign adviser. According to journalist Bob Ingles 2012 biography of Christie, it was Jeffrey Michaels who delivered the good news to Christie on election night that he had won.

In a public television interview after that election, Jeffrey Michaels was asked how close he is to Christie. Ive known him for a long time, he said. We went to high school with  we  our families knew each other from Livingston, and just stayed in close contact with him over the years and was very pleased to help his campaign out with policy.

Once Christie became governor, Jeffrey Michaels newly-created lobbying venture flourished. Teaming up with Phil Norcross  who is the brother of George Norcross, the preeminent Democratic power-broker in the state and a not-so-secret ally of Christies  Jeffrey Michaels launched Optimus Partners L.L.C. In just one year his lobbying revenue increased by a factor of seven, according to a 2011 report in Philadelphia Inquirer.

Attempts to reach Jeffrey Michaels through his office were unsuccessful. Local reports and I.R.S. filings show that Jeffrey Michaels has donated extensively to pro-Christie groups, including $25,000 to a PAC created to push the governors agenda and $20,450 since October 2012 to the Republican Governors Association, the organization Christie is now heading as he explores a possible 2016 presidential bid.",[]

Bush will meet with Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as the candidates travel to Miami for another Republican primary debate taking place Thursday.

Notably absent from the list of meetings is current GOP front-runner Donald Trump, who sparred with Bush throughout the campaign  even as Bush sank in the polls.

msnbc.com,,Prosecutors renew request for Apple to open iPhone in Brooklyn case,['Pete Williams'],"The Justice Department Monday asked a federal judge to force Apple to help investigators open the iPhone of a suspected Brooklyn drug dealer.

Prosecutors are seeking to overturn last weeks ruling from a federal magistrate denying the governments request. Mondays step is, in essence, the first step in an appeal.

RELATED: Apple doesnt have to help in NY iPhone case, judge says

In light of the debate that has recently come to surround this issue, it is worth briefly noting what this case is not about. Apple is not being asked to do anything it does not currently have the capability to do, the Justice Departments court filing said.

The Brooklyn case involves an older model device, an iPhone 5s, running an older version of the operating system, iOS 7. For that reason, prosecutors said, Apple is not required to write new software to allow investigators to unlock the phone.

This is a substantial difference from the controversy over the iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino attackers, which was running iOS 8. In order to allow FBI agents to try thousands of combinations of passcodes to open that device, Apple would have to install new software to disable the security functions on the phone.

NBCs Justice Correspondent Pete Williams joins Andrea Mitchell to explain this privacy versus... embed like save share group

The company has argued that such a step would create a master key, jeopardizing the security of millions of iPhones worldwide.

In the Brooklyn case, by contrast, no such new software would be required.

Apple may perform the passcode-bypass in its own lab, using its own technicians, just as it always has, without revealing to the government how it did so. Therefore, granting the application will not affect the technological security of any Apple iPhone nor hand the government a master key, the governments brief said.

Apples lawyers said last month that they have consistently agreed to extract data from older locked phones when served with a lawful court order. But the company stopped doing so after the magistrate judge in Brooklyn last October questioned the court procedure used by the Justice Department.

Lawyers for Apple have not yet responded to the governments new request.

msnbc.com,,Study finds Zika damages babies at all stages of pregnancy,['Maggie Fox'],"The babies of women infected with Zika virus while they are pregnant can suffer the effects at any stage of gestation, researchers reported Friday in a troubling look at how Zika affects unborn children.

Two babies died just before they should have been born after their mothers became infected, the international team found. They also found the virus causes a range of birth defects beyond microcephaly.

They suggest a name for these effects: Zika virus congenital syndrome. Babies have been born with a range of brain and eye defects and some have also been abnormally small.

The findings, together with other studies, support what most experts already believe: that Zika is causing an epidemic of birth defects.

Earlier Friday, a different team reported that tests in lab dishes show that Zika goes straight into developing brain cells and turns them into virus factories before killing them.

And the findings strongly support the idea that Zika, a once-obscure virus believed to cause little more than a headache and a rash, can be a killer.

RELATED: Mysteries of the Zika virus stump even the experts

Despite mild clinical symptoms, Zika virus infection during pregnancy appears to be associated with grave outcomes, including fetal death, placental insufficiency, fetal growth restriction and central nervous system injury, they wrote in their report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

We saw problems with the fetus or the pregnancy at eight weeks, 22 weeks, 25 weeks, and we saw problems at 35 weeks, said Dr. Karin Nielsen, professor of clinical pediatrics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles, who helped organize the study.

Even if the fetus isnt affected the virus appears to damage the placenta, which can lead to fetal death, Nielsen said. Two babies died just days before they were due.

Any woman with Zika virus should be handled as a high-risk pregnancy, Nielsen told NBC News.

Theres more than microcephaly. There is a spectrum of disease. There are parts of the brain that are not formed. There are calcifications in the brain. There is in-utero growth restriction.

Many of the symptoms are similar to whats been seen when women get rubella while pregnant, including microcephaly, marked by a smaller than normal brain and head. Children who survive birth with microcephaly can grow up with often profound physical and mental disabilities.

Calcifications are hardened remnants of dead tissue. Other studies have shown that Zika in the brains of some babies miscarried or aborted after a mother was infected.

Nielsen was working with Dr. Patricia Brasil and colleagues at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro. They were already running a study of dengue virus, asking pregnant women to come in and be tested if they showed symptoms of dengue, such as a rash.

RELATED: US athletes should consider not attending Olympics if they fear Zika: Officials

Dengue is related to Zika and its spread by the same mosquitoes, the Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that spread Zika. And like Zika, dengue is spreading fast across Brazil and other Latin American countries.

So Nielsens team was up and running when Zika started causing alarm. They tested blood and urine from 88 women between September and February. More than 80 percent of the women with symptoms such as fever and rash tested positive for Zika in the blood, urine or both.

The women were at various stages of pregnancy. Nielsens team was able to follow them in real time to see what happened to their pregnancies. They found 29 percent of the fetuses had some sort of problem, from brain damage to damage to the placenta.

Nielsens study is the first to show what happens from the time a woman becomes infected. That can answer one big question: when the most dangerous time of pregnancy is.

We know when the infection is taking place, she said. We can associate that with weeks of gestation, so we can know if there are any malformations, what time they happened  we can associate them with a first trimester, second trimester and third trimester infection.

The answers are not reassuring. The experts have predicted that the first trimester would be the most dangerous time for a fetus if a woman became infected. But Nielsens team found babies were hurt even late in pregnancy.

One important finding was that there were problems with pregnancy in the third trimester as well, which was surprising to us, she said.

Some had looked normal on ultrasound, even, before they died in the womb. It is not normal to find two fetal deaths that late in pregnancy in that small a group of women, she said.

The team is studying the babies to see if they can find out why they died. And theyre watching the rest of the pregnant women to see what happens.

World Health Organization and Brazilian health officials are worried. Theyve seen more than 4,000 cases of microcephaly in recent months, and more than a million people have been infected. Colombia, the second Latin American country to get hit with Zika, has started to report Zika-linked cases of microcephaly.

This virus hit in a perfect storm, Nielsen said. You are talking about a very large population in Brazil. When you have a lot of people infected, you are going to see problems.

msnbc.com,,"First Read: 2016 momentum shifts, but not the math",[],"First Read is a morning briefing from Meet the Press and the NBC Political Unit on the days most important political stories and why they matter.

Momentum shifts in both presidential races, but not the math view photo essay The presidential campaign: Donald Trump Make America Great Again.

Last nights primary and caucus results changed the momentum in both presidential races. But they didnt significantly alter the overall math and trajectory of the two contests. Lets start with the Republican race. Donald Trump headed into last night losing some steam after Ted Cruzs gains over the weekend. And what did Trump do? He won the Michigan and Mississippi primaries by double digits over Cruz, and he even triumphed in Hawaiis caucuses. (Trumps one loss came in Idaho, where Cruz beat him, 45%-28%.) Still, the results dont truly change the overall math for Trump: He still needs to win Florida and/or Ohio to be on a stronger path to the 1,237 delegates needed to capture the GOP nomination. The good news for him: His top competition in Florida (Marco Rubio) and Ohio (John Kasich) certainly dont have the political winds at their backs. Heres the GOP delegate math:

Trump needs to win 52% of remaining delegates to reach 1,237 magic number

Trump needs to win 59% of remaining delegates to reach 1,237 magic number

Trump needs to win 69% of remaining delegates to reach 1,237 magic number

Bernies YUGE win and YUGE delegate deficit

As for the Democratic race, Bernie Sanders got a huge  YUGE  win in Michigan, defying the pundits and the polls. We called it a last stand of sorts for his campaign, and it won the battle in surprising fashion. And now he has momentum heading into next weeks contest in Ohio. But Sanders has two problems: One, he actually lost ground in pledged delegates (due to Hillary Clintons big win in Mississippi). And two, next week doesnt just feature Ohio  its also Florida, Illinois, Missouri, and North Carolina, where well likely see Clinton increase her delegate lead. The current math after last night: Clinton leads Sanders among pledged delegates by 761-547. And among all delegates (including superdelegates), its 1193-569. To reach the magic number, Sanders will need to win 60% of all remaining delegates.

Hillary wont be able to shake Sanders anytime soon

Despite that math, however, Clinton doesnt seem likely to shake Sanders anytime soon, especially with the kind of money Sanders is raising. In a way, she is Mitt Romney of 2012 (the sure bet to be the nominee, but who has to grind it out), and Sanders is Rick Santorum (who has a big chunk of the base on his side). Of course, Sanders has A LOT more money than Santorum ever did. On Monday, Clinton told Michigan voters, The sooner I could become your nominee, the more I could begin to turn attention to the Republicans. Her problem: She still has to worry about Sanders.

The importance of open vs. closed primaries

One of the big secrets to Trumps and Sanders success last night was the open nature of last nights primaries in Mississippi and Michigan. In Michigan, 31% of the voters were independents, and Trump bested Kasich among them, 36%-27%. And on the Democratic side in Michigan, Clinton won Democrats by a 57%-41% margin, but Sanders won among indies (who made up 28% of the electorate), 71%-28%. Looking ahead to next weeks contests, Florida is a closed primary, while Ohio isnt as open as Michigan is. Per Ohios election law, you declare your political party affiliation by requesting the ballot of a political party in a partisan primary election. If you do not desire to affiliate with a political party in Ohio, you are considered to be an unaffiliated voter. An unaffiliated voter does not vote the ballot of a political party in a primary election. However, an unaffiliated voter may vote the Official Questions & Issues Ballot, if there is one for the voters precinct at the election.",[]

What keeps you motivated to work in student government?

Student government offers young people an institutional route to change-making on a local level. For many of us, ages 16-24 is the period during which we start learning to take responsibility for not only ourselves, but also those around us. For me, student government has been an opportunity to not only elevate this sense of responsibility, but also to show my respect and care for the community I live in.

What issues are you most passionate about following this election season? Why?

Theres so much to talk about! Ill pick one: college cost. Sure, we can expect students to pay for their education. But should we expect students to take out life-long loan repayment plans? Probably not. If were gonna say anyone can make a good life in America as long as they try hard enough, the people trying hard enough better be able to live decently. From the perspective of foster youth, native youth, black or brown students, and low-income students more broadly, cost is just one more barrier to entry  Im interested in hearing clever, reasonable strategies for building a better higher education system from the front runners.

Has feminism played a role in your life? If so, how?

Of course! Feminism, as a broader social movement for liberation, has a long, complex history in the United States. While mainstream (#leanin) feminism taught me how to bring my A-game in a workplace culture historically built to prioritize male-associated gender norms, I think its important to recognize the mixed-nature of this kind of feminism. It operates to the disadvantage of less wealthy, women of color and gender non-conforming people. Folks in these latter categories taught me to center discussions of fairness and dessert on those who have been most systemically wronged by governmental and other social institutions. With this lens, we might envision policy initiatives that have broader-reaching impact.

Have you ever been in a protest? If so, how was it and how has it affected your leadership work?

Good question. Yes. There are many important avenues for engaging your community and your state in an effort to seek political change. Public protest is one of these avenues. The most formative protest I participated in was in conjunction with Black Lives Matters call to #ReclaimMLK on MLK weekend last year. The decision to partake and the experience itself helped me define my commitment to undermining race-based injustices. More importantly, it taught me how to be a better ally to black and brown activists in their struggle to end ongoing state violence against their communities.

If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you go and why?

Sagar and Ahmedabad, Gujarat, Central India. My parents are both from the state of Gujarat in India, where they grew up and spent their early adulthood. The last time I visited their hometowns I was seven years old. Now that Im a bit older, I think I could appreciate, learn more, and ask the right questions to better understand how my parents experience in Gujarat affected their lives and careers here in the United States. Plus, from what I remember, Ahmedabads street food has endless, delicious vegetarian options!
